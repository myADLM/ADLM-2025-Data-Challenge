KeyPath ™M MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test - BT (k102342)

# Intended Use / Indications for Use

The KeyPath ™ MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test  BT is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the timely identification of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and determination of methicillin susceptibility (MSSA) or methicilin resistance (MRSA) directly from positive blood cultures.

The Test uses bacteriophage amplification to identify the presence of S. aureus and assess the phenotypic response of the target organism to cefoxitin, an indicator ofoxacillin (a methicillin aalo) resistance.

The assay is performed directly on positive blood culture specimens that are determined as Gram Positive Cocci in singles (GPC) or as Gram Positive Cocci in Clusters (GPCC) by Gram stain.

The KeyPath ™ MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test - BT is performed directly on positive blood culture specimens from BD BACTEC™M blood culture bottles (Plus Aerobic/F, Plus Anaerobic/F, Standard/10 Aerobic/F and Standard Anaerobic/F).

The Test is indicated for use in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical data available to the physician as an aid in the detection of MRSA/MSSA from positive blood cultures.

# Technological Characteristics

The KeyPath ™M MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test - BT (KeyPath ™ Test) is a bacteriophage amplification-enabled immunoassay to identify Staphylococcus aureus and determine its resistance or susceptibility to cefoxitin from positive blood cultures, which have been determined to have Gram Positive Cocci in singles (GPC) or Gram Positive Cocci in Clusters (GPCC) by Gram stain. This method utilizes the specificity of bacteriophage/bacteria interactions and their natural amplification processes to produce a surrogate signal. In the presence of S. aureus, bacteriophage wil replicate increasing to a detectable concentration. In the absence of S. aureus or the presence of bacteria other than S. aureus, the KeyPath ™ Test bacteriophage do not replicate and remain undetectable. In addition, susceptible strains of S. aureus do not grow in the presence of cefoxitin and therefore do not support bacteriophage amplification, while resistant strains will grow and support bacteriophage amplification.

To perform the KeyPath ™ Test, a sample of the positive blood culture is added to each of the two provided reaction tubes, each comprised of KeyPath ™m Test bacteriophage and proprietary reagents that enhance the growth of S. aureus and suppress other organisms. One Reaction Tube (Blue) is used for S. aureus identification. The second Reaction Tube (Red) is used for resistance/susceptibility testing. Following incubation, a small amount of the sample from each Tube is pipetted onto corresponding sample wells on the Detector. If the specimen contains S. aureus a pink-to-dark red/ purple Test Line (T) will appear in the Blue ID Window of the Detector.

If the sample is positive for S. aureus, Resistance/Susceptibiliy is then determined by reading the Red RS Window. Resistance (MRSA) is determined by the development of a visible pink-to-dark red/purple line at the Test Line (T) in the Red RS Window, while Susceptibility (MSSA) is determined by the absence of a visible colored line at the Test Line (T) in the Red RS Window.

# Performance Data

# Study Design

The purpose of this submission is to establish equivalent performance of the KeyPath ™M MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test - BT in additional bottle types, as compared to cleared bottle types. Previously cleared bottle types are BACTEC ™ Plus Aerobic/F and Plus Anaerobic/F. The additional bottle types for which clearance is being sought are BACTEC ™ Standard /10 Aerobic/F and Standard Anaerobic/F.

A Media Interference Study was performed to demonstrate that blood culture matrix does not act as an interferent in the KeyPath ™ Test; and a performance study was performed to demonstrate that the KeyPath ™M Test shows $\geq 9 5 \%$ positive and negative agreement for S. aureus identification and determination of methicillin resistance.

Media Interference Study

Study description and methods

Performance of the KeyPath ™ MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test - BT was analyzed in presence of 10 µL (nominal) and $2 0 \mu \iota$ (twice the nominal volume) of blood culture matrix from appropriate bottles. Five replicates of 16 strains (4 MRSA, 4 MSSA and 8 NSA) were tested. For test matrix and positive controls, blood culture bottles containing blood from volunteers were inoculated with approximately 100 CFU of bacteria and grown to alarm in the BACTEC ™m 9050. Negative controls were comprised of un-inoculated blood culture mix containing blood. No interference was demonstrated if the correct results for each strain type were observed.

Results and conclusions

Negative controls - For both SA and SN bottles the KeyPath ™ Test returned negative results (NSA) in all replicates, as shown in Tables 6.1 and 6.2.

Positive controls - For both SA and SN bottles, the KeyPath ™m Test returned the expected results in all replicates, as shown in Tables 6.1 and 6.2.

Test matrix - For both SA and SN bottles, the KeyPath ™ Test returned the expected results in all replicates, as shown in Tables 6.1 and 6.2.

All test results are as expected. We conclude that blood culture matrix from SA and SN bottes does not interfere with the KeyPath ™M MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test - BT.

Study description and methods

A panel of $\geq 2 0$ MRSA, $\geq 2 0$ MSSA and $\geq 2 0$ NSA clinical blood culture isolates from unique patients was tested in the KeyPath Tm MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test  BT.

BACTEC TM Standard/10 Aerobic/F (SA) and Standard Anaerobic/F (SN) bottles were charged with blood from healthy volunteers per IRB-approved study protocol MP2007A. Bottles were inoculated with approximately 100 CFU from fresh overnight cultures.

Testing and external daily controls were performed per Package Insert instructions (181- 00005 Rev A) within 24 hours of alarm. Bottles that did not alarm within 3 days were discarded.

Results and conclusions

Tables 6.3 and 6.4 summarize the SA bottle data for S. aureus identification, and determination of resistance and susceptibility within S. aureus, respectively. Tables 6.5 and 6.6 summarize the SN bottle data for S. aureus identification, and determination of resistance and susceptibility within S. aureus, respectively.

# Substantial Equivalence

The KeyPath TM MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test - BT, when used on samples from BACTEC ™m Standard/10 Aerobic/F or Standard Anaerobic/F bottles, is as safe and effective as the KeyPath ™M MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test - BT when used on samples from cleared bottle types (BACTEC ™ Plus Aerobic/F and Plus Anaerobic/F). The KeyPath ™ MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test  BT technological characteristics and principles of operation are unchanged. Other than the addition of bottle types, the intended use is unchanged. The expanded intended use raises no new issues of safety or effectiveness. Performance data demonstrate that the KeyPath ™M MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test  BT, when used on samples from BACTEC ™M Standard/10 Aerobic/F or Standard Anaerobic/F bottles, is as safe and effective as the KeyPath ™m MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test - BT when used on samples from cleared bottle types (BACTEC TM Plus Aerobic/F and Plus

Anaerobic/F). Thus, the KeyPath ™M MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test - BT is substantially equivalent when used with additional BACTEC ™ bottle types.
