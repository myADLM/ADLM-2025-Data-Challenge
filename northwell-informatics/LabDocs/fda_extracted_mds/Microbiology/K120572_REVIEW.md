# 5. Design Control Activities Summary:

# a) Risk Analysis:

A Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) method was used to facilitate, capture, and quantify the potential impact of a Low Signal Pack (LSP) occurrence. For the FMEA analysis, the severity of consequences for failure of the ToRC IgG assay to detect toxoplasmosis, rubella, and cytomegalovirus IgG was determined on an analyte by analyte basis using 21 CFR 860, ISO: 14971 (2009) Annex H, and IVDD (98/79/EC). Additionally, the probability of an assay failure occurring, the likelihood that these assay failures would be detected, and the potential misuse of the ToRC IgG assay were considered as part of the risk analysis.

The Residual Risk acceptability criteria (RPN score) was established at $\leq 1 9$ for low level of concern according to the submitter’s FMEA risk management plan. The manufacturer showed that, for all analytes measured, the RPN score ranged from 9-16, which represents a low level of concern and does not require additional mitigation activity.

Furthermore, the sponsor implemented additional risk control measures by improving the manufacturing process or environment with regards to minimizing contamination during manufacturing of the kit components.

b) Verification and Validation activities:

The QC data collected from the initial development verification and clinical validation studies for the ToRC IgG Assay show that no incidence of LSP was observed in the assay formulation. In addition to the verification and validation studies, the manufacturer conducted studies to investigate the effects of bacterial and mold contaminants on the performance of the ToRC IgG assay. These studies were conducted by spiking the BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgG kit with mold and bacterial filtrates at extreme concentrations. The percent recovery of the Positive QC Control was within $9 0 - 1 2 0 \%$ . This is within the manufacturer’s pre-established acceptance range. Additionally, the QC control values reported in the spiked samples fell within the pre-established range for all analytes tested in the ToRC IgG assay. These results indicate that the ToRC IgG assay is not significantly affected by challenge with microbial contaminants.

c) Declaration of Conformity   
A “Declaration of Conformity” statement was submitted duly signed by the responsible individuals. The statements indicate that;

i) As required by the risk analysis, all verification and validation activities were performed by the designated individual(s) and the results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance criteria were met, and

ii) The manufacturing facility is in conformance with design control procedure requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and the records are available for review.

In conclusion, based on both the results of the verification/validation studies and the risk management report, the modified QC procedure fulfills the requirements of the specifications of the design control process. This indicates that this modification of QC testing frequency provides an assay performance that is substantially equivalent to the current cleared kit.

# 6. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary, and the Indications for Use Enclosure.

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular modification and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and, on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
