# 5.4 Predicate Device

8D (Copan) Liquid Amies Collection and Transport System

510K Number: KO61301

# 5.5 Device Description

Puritan Liquid Amies Collection and Transport System is comprised of a sterile peel pouch containing a polyester flock swab applicator for collecting specimen and a polypropylene vial containing 1 ml of modified Amies liquid transport medium. The polyester flock swab applicators are provided in two different tip sizes to accommodate various specimen types.

Amies liquid medium is a nonnutritive balanced salt solution containing inorganic phosphates to provide buffering capability, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride and magnesium chloride to provide essential ions that help maintain osmotic balance. Sodium thioglycollate provides a reduced environment. It is recommended for maintaining the viability of aerobic, anaerobic and fastidious bacteria during the transport to the laboratory.

# 5.6 Intended Use

Puritan Liquid Amies Collection and Transport System is intended for use in the collection and transport of clinical specimens containing aerobic, anaerobic and fastidious bacteria from the patient to the laboratory for bacteriological examination and culture.

# 5.6.1 Indication(s) For Use

Puritan Liquid Amies Collection and Transport System is intended for use in the collection and transport of clinical specimens containing aerobic, anaerobic and fastidious bacteria from the patient to the laboratory for bacteriological examination and culture.

# 5.7 Substantial Equivalence statement

Puritan Liquid Amies Collection and Transport Systems is similar in design, manufacturing and intended usage to the predicate device. Both Puritan and predicate devices are single-use devices intended for collection and transport of clinical specimens containing aerobes, anaerobes and fastidious bacteria.

# 5.8 Recovery Testing

To determine the ability of the Puritan Amies liquid medium to maintain viability of different strains of aerobes, anaerobes and fastidious bacteria, known inocula of ATCC type culture and clinically significant microorganisms were inoculated into the Puritan liquid Amies transport medium and compared to the predicate device following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute(CLSl), M40-A guidelines. The Puritan Liquid Amies system showed recovery of bacteria within the acceptance criteria like the predicate device.

# 5.9 Stability Testing

Stability tests were performed on Puritan Amies liquid products to verify the ability of the aged products to maintain microbial recovery up to the expiry date.

# 5.10 pH Stability

The pH of the test device was measured at predetermined time intervals up to 18 month after manufacturing date. The test was performed using calibrated pH meter with random samples from three different lots of Puritan Liquid Amies Collection and Transport System. All samples tested were found to maintain pH within the specified range.

# 5.11 Cytotoxicity

Cytotoxicity test was conducted to evaluate glue, shaft and the polyester (flock) swabs for potential cytotoxicity effect following ISO Elution Method-1X MEM Extract. No evidence of cytotoxicity was detected.

# 5.12 Sterilization

Puritan Liquid Amies Transport Systems are sterilized by gamma irradiation and validated following ANSI/AAMl/IS0 11137:2006, Sterilization of health care products radiation guidelines.

Dear Mr. Karamchi:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls.
