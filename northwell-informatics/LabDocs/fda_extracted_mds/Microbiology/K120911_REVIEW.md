# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use:

The Cepheid $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Xpert Flu Assay is an automated, multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay intended for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A, influenza B and 2009 H1N1 influenza viral RNA. The Xpert Flu Assay uses nasal aspirates/washes and nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. The Xpert Flu Assay is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.

Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2009-2010 influenza season when 2009 H1N1 influenza was the predominant influenza A virus in circulation. When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $3 +$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

2. Indication for use: Same as Intended Use

3. Special conditions for use statement: For prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements:

The Xpert Flu Assay requires use of the GeneXpert Dx (software version 4.3 or higher), GeneXpert Infinity-48 System (software version 4.3 or higher), or the GeneXpert Infinity-80 System (software version 6.0 or higher) from Cepheid.

# I. Device Description:

The Xpert Flu Assay is an automated in vitro diagnostic test for qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A, influenza B and influenza A subtype 2009 H1N1 from nasal aspirates/washes (NA/W) and nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert instrument systems.

The GeneXpert instrument systems automate and integrate sample purification, nucleic acid amplification, and detection of the target sequence in simple or complex samples using realtime PCR and rRT-PCR assays. The GeneXpert Instrument System family comprises the GeneXpert Dx System, the GeneXpert Infinity-48 System, and the GeneXpert Infinity-80 System, a computer, and preloaded software for running tests and viewing the results. The GeneXpert Infinity Instruments also provide robotic features for cartridge handling. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids, an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or spores, a valve drive for sample movement, and an I-CORE $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and detection.

All systems require the use of the assay-specific single-use disposable cartridges that hold the PCR reagents and host the PCR process. The patented single-use cartridges contain: (1) eleven chambers for holding sample, reagents, or other materials, (2) a valve body composed of a plunger and syringe barrel, (3) a rotary valve system for controlling the movement of fluids between chambers, (4) an area for capturing, concentrating, washing, and lysing cells, (5) dry real-time PCR reagents, (6) an integrated PCR reaction tube that can be automatically filled by the instrument, and (7) liquid reagents. To eliminate test-to-test contamination, all fluids including amplicons, are contained within the disposable cartridge. The instrument never comes into contact with any fluids within the cartridge. Each disposable cartridge is intended to test one sample. Cartridges are not re-usable.

The GeneXpert cartridge is loaded onto the GeneXpert Instrument System platform, which performs hands-off automated sample processing and real-time PCR for detection of RNA or DNA. Summary and detailed test results are obtained in 75 minutes and are displayed in tabular and graphic formats.

A sample processing control (SPC) and a system control (probe check control) are controls utilized by the GeneXpert Instrument System platform. The SPC is pre-loaded into the GeneXpert cartridge provided with the assay. The SPC is an encapsulated RNA made up of recombinant fragments developed so that there is no homology to the influenza genome. The SPC is present to control for adequate processing of the target viruses and to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the PCR reaction to reduce the possibility of false negative results.

The SPC also ensures the PCR reaction conditions (temperature and time) are appropriate for the amplification reaction and that the PCR reagents are functional. The Probe Check Control verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity and dye stability.

Commercially-available external controls may also be run in accordance with local, state, and federal accrediting organizations, as applicable.

The Xpert Flu Assay includes reagents for the simultaneous detection of the target viruses. The primers and probes in the Xpert Flu Assay detect the presence of nucleic acid sequences for Influenza A (Flu A), Influenza B (Flu B) and Influenza A sub-type 2009 H1N1 (2009 H1N1). The assay for detection of Influenza A uses primers and probes designed against a region in segment 8 of the influenza genome that encodes the matrix gene. The assay for differentiation of 2009 H1N1 targets a region in segment 4 that encodes the hemagglutinin gene. The assay for detection of RNA from Influenza B uses primers and probes designed against segment 4 in a region that encodes the hemagglutinin gene.

Nasal aspirates/washes (NA/W) and nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens from patients suspected of having influenza are collected in Universal Transport Medium (UTM) and transported to the GeneXpert area.

The specimen is briefly mixed by inverting the collection tube 5 times. For NP swab specimens, using the supplied $3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ transfer pipette, $3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the sample are transferred to the sample chamber (large opening) of the Xpert Flu Assay Cartridge. For NA/W specimens, the specimen is first diluted by using the supplied $3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ transfer pipette and transferring $3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the specimen 2 times ( $6 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ total) into a fresh $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ $( 3 0 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L } )$ UTM tube. The diluted specimen is mixed by inverting the tube 5 times. Using a clean supplied $3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ transfer pipette, $3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the diluted specimen are transferred to the chamber with the large opening of the Xpert Flu Assay Cartridge.

Reagent 1 (Binding Reagent) is dispensed by squeezing the entire contents into the chamber with the small opening of the Xpert Flu Assay Cartridge. The GeneXpert Instrument system performs sample preparation by mixing the sample with the sample processing control and treatment reagents, capturing the nucleic acids on a cellulose column. The column is washed to remove contaminants and the purified nucleic acids are eluted and then mixed with dry real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) reagents and transferred into the PCR tube for rRT-PCR and detection of Flu RNA. The complete process takes about 75 minutes.

The results are interpolated by the GeneXpert Instrument Systems software from measured fluorescent signals and embedded calculation algorithms. All possible final test results are described below.

The Xpert Flu Assay provides test results for influenza A, influenza B and influenza A, subtype 2009 H1N1, according to the following algorithms:

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not applicable.

# L. Test Principle:

The primers and probes in the Xpert Flu Assay detect the presence of proprietary sequences for influenza A (Flu A), influenza B (Flu B) and influenza A sub-type 2009 H1N1 (2009 H1N1). Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and nasal aspirate/wash (NA/W) samples are collected following the user institution’s standard procedures and placed into Universal Transport Medium ( $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ UTM tubes) prior to being transported to the GeneXpert System area. For nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens, the sample is mixed briefly by inverting the UTM

tube 5 times. Using a supplied $3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ transfer pipette, $3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the mixed sample is transferred to the chamber with the large opening of the Xpert Flu Assay Cartridge. For nasal aspirate/wash (NA/W) samples, the sample is diluted by placing $6 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the NAW sample (using a $3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ transfer pipetter 2 times) into a $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ UTM tube. The contents of the tube are mixed by inverting the tube 5 times. Following the mixing step, $3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the diluted, mixed sample is transferred to the chamber with the large opening of the Xpert Flu Assay Cartridge.

After the sample is added, Reagent 1, a Binding Reagent, is transferred by squeezing the entire contents of the Reagent 1 tube into the chamber with the small opening of the Xpert Flu Assay Cartridge.

The user initiates a test from the system user interface, the instrument signals the user where to place the cartridge, and the cartridge is placed into the indicated module in the GeneXpert Dx System instrument, or onto a conveyor belt on the GeneXpert Infinity System, which then transports the cartridge to the appropriate GeneXpert module or to the holding area for later transport to the appropriate GeneXpert module. Fluidic movements under control of the instrument move the sample and reagents to and from different chambers within the Xpert Flu Assay cartridge. The GeneXpert instrument systems perform sample preparation by first mixing the sample with the Sample Processing Control (encapsulated RNA) in the form of a lyophilized bead within the cartridge. Lysis of the viral particles with Lysis Reagent is followed by mixing with Binding Reagent which allows capture of the nucleic acids on the cellulose column. The column is then washed to remove contaminants and finally, the purified nucleic acids are eluted with an elution reagent. The nucleic acid solution is mixed with dry rRT-PCR reagents and transferred into the PCR tube for real-time RT-PCR and detection of Flu RNA. The Xpert Flu Assay completes sample preparation and real-time RTPCR in 75 minutes. Internal controls in the Xpert Flu Assay check key automated steps.
