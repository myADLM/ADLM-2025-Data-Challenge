# SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION OF THE TEST

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunisticinfection of the central nervous S) cau y JC vius (JCV,  pol vius, hat  panly nsIt is t th epos e vcc y  re-adolece) ent publihe stud reported that approximately $50 \%$ to $60 \%$ of adults have been infected with JCV, as evidenced by the prence o antibody to JCV in the serum. In rare instances, he vius reacivates and progresses  PML such as in individuals who are immune compromised. Treatment with immunomodulatory therapies ase heisk of developing PML in JCV infect individualsWhile JCV exposure s neesary r he development of PML, the development  the disease s lso dependent n both host and viral factors, as well as immune status.Since JCV infection is a necessary step for PML development, an assay to detect JCV  u patients who may be at a lower or higher risk of developing PML). .

There is an increased risk of PML in natalizumab treated multiple sclerosis (MS) and Crohn's disease (CD) patients. Three risk factors for PML have been identified in MS and CD patient populations: natalizumab treatment duration, prior immunosuppressant use, and the presence of antibodies to JCV.

# TEST PRINCIPLE

In the Focus Diagnostics' STRATIFY $J C V _ { \theta }$ DxSelect™ test, JC virus-like particles (VLP) are pre-coated o -well microtiter platesDiluted serum r plasma speciens and controls are incubated in the well to allow JCV-specific antibodies present in the specimens to react with the JC VLP antigen.Nonspeciic reactants are removed by washing. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-human antibodies are added to react with JCV-specific antibodies. Excess conjugate is removed by washing. Enzyme substrate and chroogen are aded and he color isallowed  develop.Aferading he Stop Reagent, the resultan color change is quantified by a spectrophotometric reading of optical density (OD). Specimen OD reaings are compared with Cut-Of Calibrator O readings to determine results.Each specimen result is e s an ndex valeA seen wih an ndex vale that is greater than a ecifid upper u is reported as positive for detectable JCV-specific antibodies, whereas a specimen with an index value less than the specified lower cut-off is reported as negative for detectable JCV-specific antibodies.A s wie val ha ualen e lowe cuvals ememau u urvaluatin at

In the confirmation assay, soluble JC VLP antigen will compete with plate bound JC VLP antigen for the JCV-specific antibodies present in the serum or plasma specimens. After washing away the unbound antibodies, peroxidase-conjugated anti-human antibodies are added and bind to any captured JCVspecific antibodies. Excess conjugate is removed by washing. Enzyme substrate and chromagen are colo all  evloASoRent, un colo quantified by a spectrophotometric reading of OD.

# Clinical Performance (Comparative Agreement)

Becu ML s nfrequent event inatalizumab-treatepatints,data collected fro bohciial and post-marketing reports of confirmed cases of PML were used to assess the clinical performance of the STRATIFY JCV DxSelect™ assay for PML risk stratification. A clinical plan was developed for collection o serum samples obtained from natalizumab-treated patients prior to the onset of PML for JCV antibody testing.A total of 31 available serum samples from confirmed PML patients collected at least 6 mn prior cincal os  PML wee ested  JCVty staus sig  TRATIFY $J C V _ { \otimes }$ DxSelect™ assay. In adition to the pre-PML samples, 1330 Samples from MS patients were tested by the STRATIFY JCV DxSelect™ assay. A total of 707 patients receiving treatment tested positive for abdies to JCV usig he test, and he positviy ate was etated $5 8 . 7 \%$ (414/707) with a $9 5 \%$ Cl of $54 . 9 \%$ to $6 2 . 1 \%$ lai  ivu u a $100 \%$ JCV antibody positivity demonstrated in the 31 natalizumab-treated PML patients prior to PML diagnosis was significantly different than the $5 8 . 7 \%$ JCV antibody positivity in the MS population, and represents an approximately 2-fold increased risk of PML compared to the PML incidence in the overall natalizumab-treated population.

# Performance with pre-PML samples.

The STRATIFY $J C V _ { B }$ DxSelect™ assay was compared to a cleared Anti-JCV assay (STRATIFY JCV™ Antibody ELISA) using serum samples obtained from PML patients at least 6 months prior to PML diagosis.Becaus ML is an infrequent event in natalizumab-reated patients, data colected from both clinical trial and post-marketing reports of confirmed cases of PML were used to assess the clinical performance of the STRATIFY $J C V _ { \theta }$ DxSelect ™ assay for PML risk stratification. Thirty-one available serum samples from confirmed PML patients collected at least 6 months prior to clinical diagnosis of PML were tested at one internal testing site for JCV antibody status using the STRATIFY $J C V _ { \otimes }$ DxSelect™ assay and the validated laboratory methodology. The sample set demonstrated $100 \%$ (31/31) positive agreement $( 9 5 \%$ CI: $89 . 0 \%$ to $100 \%$ with the validated assay.

# Performance with archived clinical specimens

Two groups of prospectively collected and archived clinical samples obtained from the STRATIFY-2 and the AFFIRM clinical studies were used to assess the performance of the STRATIFY $J C V _ { \otimes }$ DxSelect assay compared to the validated laboratory methodology used in the STRATIFY-2 and AFFIRM clinical studies. One group consisted of patients who were receiving natalizumab, the other group of patients had not received natalizumab therapy (and were considering receiving natalizumab).The samples were blinded and randomly distributed to two external testing sites and one internal testing siteThe data was analyzed or each group separately.Results or the two individual groups are presented in the tables below. Positive Percent Agreement was greater than $9 7 \%$ for each group and Negative Percent agreement was greater than $90 \%$ for each group.

# Positivity Rate and Expected Values:

The STRATIFY JCV DxSelect™ assay been used to evaluate JCV antibody positivity rate in serum and plasma samples from a geographically diverse cohort of 1330 MS patients.The cohort was comprised from MS patients from clinical trials including a completed Phase 3 clinical study of natalizumab in MS patients (AFFIRM C-1801), an ongoing study to evaluate seroprevalence in the MS population (STRATFY-2 [101JC402).The clinical characteristics for the MS patients within each study are shown Table 4.The age and gender distribution of the MS cohort tested with the STRATIFY $\mathsf { J C V } _ { \mathfrak { P } }$ DxSelect ™ are similar to the age and gender distribution of M patients treated with natalizumab in the postmarketing settng. JCV antibody positivity rate in the MS cohort was $5 5 \div 5 9 \%$ which is consistent with what h been n he lV y   s n   wh lowr i women compared tomen which is also consistent with what has been reported in the literature healthy adults using similar assay methodologies.

Seroprevalence data was evaluated for each study. The observed seroprevalence using the STRATIFY $J C V _ { \otimes }$ DxSelect™ assay was $59 \%$ (467/792) in the STRATIFY-2 study and $55 \%$ (296/538) in the AFFIRM Study.These seroprevalence values are consistent with the seroprevalence values observed durig the clinical studies, when the relationship between JCV serological status and PML development were described. Additionally the STRATIFY $J C V _ { @ }$ DxSelect™ assay demonstrated $100 \%$ concordance with 31 pre-PML samples.

Dear Ms. Viviani:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration..

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice

requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will alow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450.
