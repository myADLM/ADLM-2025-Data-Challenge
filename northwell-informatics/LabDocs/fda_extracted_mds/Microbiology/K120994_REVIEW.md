2. Indications for use:

The BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F medium is used in a qualitative procedure for the aerobic culture and recovery of microorganisms (bacteria and yeast) from blood. The principal use of this medium is with the BD BACTEC fluorescent series instruments.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s: Prescription use

4. Special instrument requirements: BD BACTEC fluorescent series instrument

# I. Device Description:

The sample to be tested is inoculated into one or more vials which are inserted into the BACTEC fluorescent series instrument for incubation and periodic reading. Each vial contains a chemical sensor which can detect increases in CO2 produced by the growth of microorganisms. The sensor is monitored by the instrument every ten minutes for an increase in its fluorescence, which is proportional to the amount of CO2 present. A positive reading indicates the presumptive presence of viable microorganisms in the vial. Detection is limited to microorganisms that will grow in a particular type of medium.

Resins have been described for the treatment of blood specimens both prior to and after their inoculation into culture media. Resins have been incorporated into BACTEC culture media to enhance recovery of organisms without a need for special processing.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not applicable

# L. Test Principle:

If microorganisms are present in the test sample inoculated into the BACTEC vial, $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ will be produced when the organisms metabolize the substrates present in the vial. Increases in the fluorescence of the vial sensor caused by the higher amount of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ are monitored by the BACTEC fluorescent series instrument. Analysis of the rate and amount of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ increase enables the BACTEC fluorescent series instrument to determine if the vial is positive, i.e., that the test sample contains viable organisms.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The reproducibility study was evaluated by time to detection and recovery, in the Instrument Time to Detection and Recovery studies across three lots. Results exhibited no statistically significant difference.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Of the 30 cultures that were positive only in the predicate device, 23 of those that were negative cultures in the new device had low inoculum (0 to 1 CFU per bottle) levels. The remaining seven failures were at the 1 to 10 CFU per bottle inoculum level. The organisms were Cryptococcus neoformans, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus epidermidis (3 and $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of blood), Streptococcus pneumoniae (two replicates at $3 \mathrm { m L }$ of blood) and Streptococcus sanguinis.

Of the 23 cultures that were positive only in the new device, 19 had low inoculum (0 to 1 CFU per bottle) levels. The remaining four failures were at the 1 to 10 CFU per bottle inoculum level. The four that failed to detect in the 1 to 10 CFU range included Candida glabrata, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Thirty-eight species failed to detect in both the new and predicate devices. Thirty-three of the failures were at the lowest dilution (0 to 1 CFU per bottle) and 5 were at the 1 to 10 CFU per bottle dilution: Escherichia coli, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.

The claim for the new BD BACTEC Plus PRIME Aerobic /F bottle was 10- 100 CFU/bottle. This data is therefore acceptable for the claimed microbial detection level.

e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

Performance of the BD BACTEC Plus PRIME Aerobic/F medium was evaluated on three lots during internal analytical studies to demonstrate comparable performance to the predicate device – the BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F medium. All studies utilized the BD BACTEC FX fluorescent-series instrument operating on the released software (4.10a).

# Percent Recovery (Sensitivity) study

A total of 246 paired sets at 10 to 100 CFU per bottle were evaluated in the Percent Recovery comparison. The study included six replicate paired sets per organism and there were a total of 41 organisms. The six replicate paired sets are comprised of three lots with two blood volumes per lot for both the new and predicate devices. There were 244 $( 9 9 . 2 \% )$ positive in both the new and predicate devices.

The two recovery failures observed were with Kingella kingae. Subsequent testing of five isolates of $K .$ . kingae, including the false negative isolate noted above, under the same test conditions and over three lots all demonstrated growth and recovery as expected.

# Instrument Time to Detection

The Instrument Time to Detection (TTD) study included blood volumes, and organisms. The TTD study included data from both the Percent Recovery and Microbial Detection Limit studies. Each organism was inoculated at appropriate inoculum levels, across two blood volumes $3 \mathrm { m L }$ and $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ ) over three lots of media. The Microbial Detection Limit study was conducted at the lower inoculum levels (replicates at 0 – 1 CFU, 1 – 10 CFU per bottle); the Percent Recovery study at 10 – 100 CFU per bottle.

The following organisms had a mean TTD difference that was more rapid in the predicate device: Abiotrophia defectiva $( 2 . 3 9 \mathrm { h } )$ , Acinetobacter lwoffii (0.97), Cardiobacterium hominis (3.11 h), Haemophilus influenzae $( 3 . 7 0 \mathrm { h } )$ , Streptococcus sanguinis (8.12 h), Candida albicans (0.75 h), Enterococcus faecalis $( 0 . 6 2 \mathrm { h } )$ , Granulicatella spp. (1 h), Kingella kingae (4.38 h), Micrococcus luteus (1.06 h), Pediococcus acidilactici $( 1 . 0 8 \mathrm { h } )$ and Streptococcus pneumoniae $( 0 . 8 1 \mathrm { h } )$ . Leuconostoc spp. exhibited a mean TTD difference increase of $1 0 . 0 0 \mathrm { h }$ compared to the predicate device (mean TTD of 69.21 h), an increase of $1 4 . 4 5 \%$ in the new device.

# False Positive Rate Study

False positivity was assessed with bottles inoculated with freshly drawn human blood (i.e. 2, 4, 6, 8 and $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ ). No organisms were added to the bottle. There were 120 bottles per device across three lots. No positive results were observed.

# False Negative Rate Study

The data for this study was generated from the Instrument Time to Detection, Percent Recovery (Sensitivity), and Microbial Detection Limit studies. Bottles that are instrument negative at 120 hours and found to be positive when subcultured are classified as false negative bottles.

A total of 93 paired sets were evaluated to determine the false negatives, with the following results:

Detected in predicate device only 32 Detected in new device only 23 Detected in neither devices (Negatives) 38 paired sets

There were a total of 12 false negative bottles with instrument negative, subculture positive. There were eight false negative results with the BACTEC Plus PRIME Aerobic/F: Micrococcus luteus, Cryptococcus neoformans and six replicates of Haemophilus parainfluenzae biotype I. There were four false negative results with the predicate device: two replicates of Haemophilus parainfluenzae biotype I, Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida glabrata.

There were two false negative bottles with both instrument and subculture negative: two replicates of Kingella kingae with $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of blood (plate count 31 CFU) in the new BACTEC Plus PRIME Aerobic/F media. Subsequent testing of five additional isolates of K. kingae, including the false negative isolate noted above, at inoculum 50- 100 CFU and across three lots all demonstrated recovery of Kingella kingae.

There was no statistically significant difference in the false negative rate between the new BACTEC Plus PRIME Aerobic/F media and the predicate device.

# Antimicrobial Neutralization Capability

The ability of the medium to recover organisms in the presence of eleven antimicrobials at minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) levels was evaluated. Each antimicrobial was tested with three organisms that would be appropriately treated with the drug and each organism was susceptible to the drug at the concentration inoculated into the bottle. The bottles were then assessed for recovery. There were a total of 99 paired sets for this study.

The antimicrobial classes evaluated in this study were: Aminoglycosides, Carbapenems, Glycopeptides, $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ gen. Cephalosporins, Fluoroquinolones, Tetracyclines, $4 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ gen. Cephalosporins, Monobactams, Triazoles, Glycylcycline,

+Penicillins / $\beta$ -lactamase inhibitors

The data demonstrated that in the presence of Aztreonam at MIC level, the ability of the new medium to recover organisms was $5 5 . 6 \%$ (5/9), and $6 6 . 7 \%$ (6/9) for the predicate medium. Monobactams (Aztreonam) and Carbapenems were not included in the predicate device when cleared. The performance of the carbapenem was acceptable.

A subset of five commonly-used antimicrobials representative of their classes was further evaluated at peak serum levels, concentrations at an average of $2 0 \mathrm { x }$ the MIC of the test organisms. Each antimicrobial was tested with organisms that would be appropriately treated with the drug and each organism was susceptible to the drug at the concentration inoculated into the bottle. There were 150 paired sets of which 66 pair sets were not detected in both the predicate and the new devices:
