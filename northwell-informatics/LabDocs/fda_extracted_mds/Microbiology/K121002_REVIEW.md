2. Classification: II

3. Product code: JWY - Manual Antimicrobial Test Systems

4. Panel: 83 Microbiology

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

Etest $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ is a quantitative technique for determining the antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Gram-negative and Gram positive aerobic bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus species and fastidious bacteria, such as anaerobes, $N .$ . gonorrhoeae, S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus and Haemophilus species. The system comprises a predefined antibiotic gradient which is used to determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), in $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ , of different antimicrobial agents against microorganisms as tested on agar media using overnight incubation.

This submission is for the addition of the antimicrobial ceftaroline at concentrations of $0 . 0 0 2 - 3 2 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ to the Etes $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ product. Ceftaroline has been shown to be active in vitro against most strains of the microorganism listed below, as described in the FDA-approved label for this antimicrobial agent.

Active in vitro and in clinical infections

Skin Infections Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates)

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

For prescription use

4. Special instrument requirements: Manual readings only

# I. Device Description:

Etest $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ consists of a thin, inert and non-porous plastic strip, $5 \mathrm { m m }$ wide and $6 0 \mathrm { m m }$ long. One side of the strip carries a two-letter code designating the identity of the antibiotic and is calibrated with MIC values in terms of $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . A predefined exponential gradient of the dried and stabilized antibiotic covers a continuous concentration range across 15 two-fold dilutions of a conventional MIC method.

Staphylococcus aureus (skin isolates only)

$$
\mathrm { S } { = } { \le } 1 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } ^ { \ast }
$$

\* The current absence of resistant isolates precludes defining any results other than “Susceptible.” Isolates yielding MIC results other than “Susceptible” should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.

# L. Test Principle:

The Etest $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ gradient technology is based on a combination of the concepts of dilution and diffusion test methods for susceptibility testing. Etest $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ directly quantifies antimicrobial susceptibility in terms of discrete MIC values. When the Etes $^ \mathrm { { \textregistered } }$ strip is applied to an inoculated agar plate, the antibiotic is immediately released from the plastic surface into the agar. A predefined, continuous gradient of antibiotic concentrations is created and maintained directly underneath the strip. After incubation whereby bacterial growth becomes visible, a symmetrical inhibition ellipse centered along the strip will be seen. The MIC value in $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ is read where the ellipse edge intersects the strip. Since Etest $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ generates MIC values which fall between two-fold dilutions for interpretation; the MIC value read must be recorded to the next two-fold dilution.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Twenty-five Staphylococcus aureus were tested at three external sites to determine site to site reproducibility demonstrating $2 9 5 \%$ reproducibility. Results were within $+ / -$ one doubling dilution agreement as compare to the mode for all sites and there were no off-scale results.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The recommended QC isolates were tested a sufficient number of times with acceptable results with the reference method. The Etest $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ results demonstrate that the system can produce QC results in the recommended range.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The CLSI recommended broth dilution reference panel was prepared according to the CLSI recommendation. Etest was set up following Table 1 (Recommended Media, Inoculum and Incubation) of the Generic Package Insert.

All isolates grew in the clinical studies.

The clinical testing included both fresh clinical isolates and stock isolates along with a challenge set with known results. A comparison was provided to the reference method with the following agreement. The ceftaroline range for S. aureus in the studies were at $0 . 1 2 5 - 2 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ in this submission.
