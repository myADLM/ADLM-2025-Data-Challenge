# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced:

CLSI - EP17A - “Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline”.

# L. Test Principle:

The SHIGA TOXIN QUIK CHEK test utilizes specific antibodies against Stx1 and Stx2. The membrane device contains a reaction window with three vertical lines of immobilized antibodies. The “1” test line contains monoclonal antibodies against Stx1. The control line $\binom { 6 6 } { \textrm { C } }$ is a dotted line that contains anti-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibodies. The $^ { \mathfrak { c } \mathfrak { c } } 2 ^ { \mathfrak { s } \mathfrak { s } }$ test line contains monoclonal antibodies against Stx2. The conjugate consists of antibodies to Stx1 and Stx2 coupled to horseradish peroxidase. To perform the test, the sample is added to a tube containing a mixture of diluent and conjugate. The diluted sample-conjugate mixture is added to the sample well and the device is allowed to incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes. During the incubation, any Stx1 and/or Stx2 present in the sample binds to the antibody-peroxidase conjugates. The toxin-antibody-peroxidase complexes migrate through a filter pad to a membrane where they are captured by the immobilized Stx1 and Stx2 specific monoclonal antibodies in the test lines. The reaction window is subsequently washed with wash buffer, followed by the addition of substrate. After a 10 minute incubation period, the reaction window is examined visually for the appearance of vertical blue lines on the “1” and $^ { \mathfrak { c } \mathfrak { c } } 2 ^ { \mathfrak { s } \mathfrak { s } }$ sides of the reaction window. A blue line on the “1” side of the reaction window is a positive result indicating the presence of Stx1. A blue line on the $^ { \mathfrak { c } \mathfrak { c } } 2 ^ { \mathfrak { s } \mathfrak { s } }$ side of the reaction window is a positive result indicating the presence of Stx2. A positive $^ { \circ \mathfrak { c } } C ^ { \mathfrak { n } } { } ^ { , }$ reaction, indicated by a vertical dotted blue line under the $^ { \circ \mathfrak { c } } C ^ { \mathfrak { n } } { } ^ { , }$ portion of the reaction window, confirms that the test is working properly, the procedure was followed, and the results are valid.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The reproducibility of the SHIGA TOXIN QUIK CHEK test was determined using 12 masked fecal specimens Testing was performed at 2 independent laboratories and on-site at TECHLABâ, Inc. The samples were tested, twice a day over a 5-day period by multiple technicians at each site using 2 different kit lots. A positive and negative control was run with each panel of the masked samples. The results from each laboratory were submitted to TECHLAB®, Inc. and compared with in-house results. The results were consistent among the different locations, and exhibited a correlation of $100 \%$ . The samples produced the expected results $100 \%$ of the time.

# Precision – Intra-Assay

For the determination of intra-assay performance, 6 positive fecal specimens (two positive for Stx1, two positive for Stx2, two positive for both Stx1 and Stx2) and six negative fecal specimens were analyzed. Each specimen was assayed on 5 cassettes. All positives remained positive and all negatives remained negative.

# Precision – Inter-Assay

The inter-assay precision of the SHIGA TOXIN QUIK CHEK test was determined using 12 fecal specimens (six negative, two positive for Stx1, two positive for Stx2, and two positive for both Stx1 and Stx2). The samples were tested, twice a day over a 5-day period using 2 different kit lots. A positive and negative control was run on each day. All positives remained positive and all negatives remained negative.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: N/A   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): N/A

d. Detection limit:

From direct fecal testing

The cutoff point for Stx1 was determined by using highly purified Stx1, and was defined as the concentration of toxin which yielded positive results $9 5 \%$ of the time, and negative results $5 \%$ of the time. The cutoff point was

determined empirically by testing dilutions of Stx1 in a negative fecal pool, in replicates of 20. Using this method, the cutoff was found to be $0 . 0 4 2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . A concentration of $0 . 0 2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ was positive $50 \%$ of the time, and a concentration of $0 . 0 2 2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ was negative $9 5 \%$ of the time.

The cutoff point for Stx2 was determined by using highly purified Stx2, and was defined as the concentration of toxin which yielded positive results $9 5 \%$ of the time, and negative results $5 \%$ of the time. The cutoff point was determined empirically by testing dilutions of $\mathbf { S } \mathbf { t x } 2$ in a negative fecal pool, in replicates of 20. Using this method, the cutoff was found to be $0 . 0 3 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . A concentration of $0 . 0 2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ was positive $50 \%$ of the time, and a concentration of $0 . 0 1 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ was negative $9 5 \%$ of the time.

# From broth cultures

The cutoff point for Stx1 was determined by using highly purified Stx1, and was defined as the concentration of toxin which yielded positive results $9 5 \%$ of the time, and negative results $5 \%$ of the time. The cutoff point was determined empirically by testing dilutions of Stx1 in overnight GN broth culture of non-toxin producing $E$ . Coli O157 (ATCC 043888), in replicates of 20. Using this method, the cutoff was found to be $0 . 0 4 2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . A concentration of $0 . 0 2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ was positive $50 \%$ of the time, and a concentration of $0 . 0 1 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ was negative $9 5 \%$ of the time.

The cutoff point for Stx2 was determined by using highly purified Stx2, and was defined as the concentration of toxin which yielded positive results $9 5 \%$ of the time, and negative results $5 \%$ of the time. The cutoff point was determined empirically by testing dilutions of Stx2 in overnight GN broth culture of non-toxin producing $E$ . Coli O157 (ATCC 043888), in replicates of 20. Using this method, the cutoff was found to be $0 . 0 3 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . A concentration of $0 . 0 2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ was positive $50 \%$ of the time, and a concentration of $0 . 0 1 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ was negative $9 5 \%$ of the time.

A study was performed to ensure that a high concentration of Stx1 toxin does not interfere with the detection of Stx2 toxin, or high concentrations of Stx2 toxin do not interfere with the detection of Stx1 toxin. Low and high concentrations were based on either $1 0 0 \mathrm { x }$ (high) or $3 \mathbf { x }$ (low) concentrations of Stx1 and Stx2 toxin. Low samples were prepared by spiking a negative fecal pool with $3 \mathbf { x }$ the $9 5 \%$ cutoff (LOD) for either toxin. High samples were prepared by spiking a negative fecal pool with $1 0 0 \mathrm { x }$ the $9 5 \%$ cutoff for either toxin. Testing was performed in triplicate according to the Package Insert instructions for direct testing. The results demonstrated that elevated levels of one analyte did not affect the detection of the other analyte.

The cutoff for the SHIGA TOXIN QUIK CHEK test was established at concentrations of $0 . 0 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ Stx1 and $0 . 0 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ Stx2.
