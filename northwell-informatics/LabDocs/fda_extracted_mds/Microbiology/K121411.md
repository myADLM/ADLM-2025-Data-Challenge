Panel 83 Microbiology

The SHIGA TOXIN CHEK test is an enzyme immunoassay for the simultaneous qualitative detection of Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1) and Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2) in a single test. It is intended for use with human fecal samples from patients with gastrointestinal symptoms to aid in the diagnosis of disease caused by Shiga Toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC). It may be used directly with human fecal specimens, or broth or plate cultures derived from fecal specimens. The test results should be considered in conjunction with the patient history.

# Explanation

Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) were first described by O' Brien, et al. after discovering that E. coli culture supernatant, which was cytotoxic to HeLa and Vero cells, could be neutralized by rabbit anti-Shiga toxin antibodies. STEC cause foodborne and waterborne diarrheal disease worldwide which, if left undiagnosed, can progress to hemorrhagic colitis and/or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Since certain treatments and medications can increase the risk of HUS, prompt detection is necessary to prevent outbreaks and secondary transmission. STEC strain O157:H7 has historically been the focus of attention in the United States since first isolated from undercooked hamburgers, causing an estimated 73,000 illnesses annually. However, STEC infections caused by non-O157 strains have become more prevalent in recent years, both in the United States as well as abroad. O157:H7 infections are routinely diagnosed by culture of fecal samples on selective media, but this methodology allows nonO157 STEC strains to go undetected. STEC produce either one or both Shiga toxins (Stx1 and/or Stx2), both potent cytotoxins. Isolates producing only Stx2 have been attributed to higher incidence rates of HUs. Shiga toxins can be detected by tissue culture assay, but this method is both time consuming and labor intensive. By detecting the toxins, the SHIGA TOXIN CHEK test can detect STEC present in fecal samples or culture, regardless of the serotype or other virulence factors.

# Device Description

The SHIGA TOXIN CHEK test uses antibodies to Stx1 and Stx2. The microassay wells supplied with the kit contain immobilized monoclonal antibodies against Stx1 and Stx2. The detecting antibody consists of a mixture of anti-Stx1 and anti-Stx2 polyclonal antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. In the assay, an aliquot of a fecal specimen or culture is emulsified in the Diluent and the diluted specimen is then transferred to the microassay well containing the detecting antibody. If Stx1 and/or Stx2 are present in the specimen, they wil bind to the detecting antibody and to the immobilized monoclonal antibodies during the incubation phase. Any unbound material is removed during the washing steps. Following the addition of substrate, a color is detected due to the enzyme-antibody-antigen complexes that form in the presence of toxin.

# Reproducibility

The reproducibility of the SHIGA TOXIN CHEK test was determined using 11 fecal specimens that were coded to prevent their identification during testing. Testing was performed at 2 independent laboratories and on-site at TECHLAB®, Inc. The samples were tested, twice a day over a 5-day period by multiple technicians at each site using 2 different kit lots.A positive and negative control was run with each panel of the masked samples. The results from each laboratory were submitted to TECHLAB®, Inc. and compared with in-house results. The results were consistent among the different locations, and exhibited a correlation of $100 \%$ .The samples produced the expected results $100 \%$ of the time.

The cutoff for the SHIGA TOXIN CHEK test for direct fecal specimens was established at concentrations of 0.28 ng/mL Stx1 and 0.23 ng/mL Stx2, and for broth cultures at concentrations of 0.18 ng/mL Stx1 and 0.30 ng/mL Stx2.

# Determination of Limitation of Detection (LOD) - cutoff points for Stx1 and Stx2 directly from fecal specimens:

The results were determined following EP17A - "Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline".

The cutoff point for Stx1 was determined by using highly purified $\sin x 1$ , and was defined as the concentration of toxin which yielded positive results $9 5 \%$ of the time, and negative results $5 \%$ of the time. The cutoff point was determined empirically by testing dilutions of Stx1 in a negative fecal pool, in replicates of 20. Using this method, the cutoff was found to be 0.280 ng/mL. A concentration of $0 . 2 7 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ was positive $50 \%$ of the time, and a concentration of $0 . 2 6 0 ~ \mathrm { \mathsf { n g / m L } }$ was negative $9 5 \%$ of the time.

The cutoff point for Stx2 was determined by using highly purified Stx2, and was defined as the concentration of toxin which yielded positive results $9 5 \%$ of the time, and negative results $5 \%$ of the time. The cutoff point was determined empirically by testing dilutions of Stx2 in a negative fecal pool, in replicates of 20. Using this method, the cutoff was found to be 0.230 $n \mathsf { g } / \mathsf { m L }$ . A concentration of $0 . 2 0 0 ~ \mathsf { n g / m L }$ was positive $50 \%$ of the time, and a concentration of 0.150 ng/mL was negative $9 5 \%$ of the time.

# Determination of Limitation of Detection (LOD) - cutoff points for Stx1 and Stx2 from broth cultures:

The results were determined following EP17A - "Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline".

The cutoff point for Stx1 was determined by using highly purified Stx1, and was defined as the concentration of toxin which yielded positive results $9 5 \%$ of the time, and negative results $5 \%$ of the time. The cutoff point was determined empirically by testing dilutions of Stx1 in overnight GN broth culture of non-toxin producing $E$ Coli O157 (ATCC 043888), in replicates of 20. Using this method, the cutoff was found to be $0 . 1 8 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . A concentration of $0 . 1 2 0 ~ \mathsf { n g / m L }$ EMPY was positive $50 \%$ of the time, and a concentration of 0.110 ng/mL was negative $9 5 \%$ of the time.

The cutoff point for Stx2 was determined by using highly purified Stx2, and was defined as the concentration of toxin which yielded positive results $9 5 \%$ of the time, and negative results $5 \%$ of the time. The cutoff point was determined empirically by testing dilutions of $\tt S t x 2$ in overnight GN broth culture of non-toxin producing $E$ Coli O157 (ATCC 043888), in replicates of 20. Using this method, the cutoff was found to be $0 . 3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { \mathfrak { n g / m L } }$ . A concentration of $0 . 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ was positive $50 \%$ of the time, and a concentration of $0 . 1 7 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ was negative $9 5 \%$ of the time.

In conclusion, the data generated for Determination of Limitation of Detection (LOD), support Package Insert claims of analytical sensitivity for direct fecal specimens was established at concentrations of 0.28 ng/mL Stx1 and 0.23 ng/mL Stx2, and for broth cultures at concentrations of 0.18 ng/mL Stx1 and 0.30 ng/mL Stx2.
