# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced :

CLSI - EP 17-A: Protocols for determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation.

# L. Test Principle:

The SHIGA TOXIN CHEK test uses antibodies to Stx1 and Stx2. The microassay wells supplied with the kit contain immobilized monoclonal antibodies against Stx1 and Stx2. The detecting antibody consists of a mixture of anti-Stx1 and anti-Stx2 polyclonal antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. In the assay, an aliquot of a fecal specimen or culture is emulsified in the Diluent and the diluted specimen is then transferred to the microassay well containing the detecting antibody. If Stx1 and/or Stx2 are present in the specimen, they will bind to the detecting antibody and to the immobilized monoclonal antibodies during the incubation phase. Any unbound material is removed during the washing steps. Following the addition of substrate, a color is detected due to the enzyme-antibody-antigen complexes that form in the presence of toxin.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The reproducibility of the SHIGA TOXIN CHEK test was determined using 11 fecal specimens that were coded to prevent their identification during testing. Testing was performed at 2 independent laboratories and on-site at TECHLABâ, Inc. The samples were tested, twice a day over a 5-day period by multiple technicians at each site using 2 different kit lots. A positive and negative control was run with each panel of the masked samples. The results from each laboratory were submitted to TECHLAB®, Inc. and compared with in-house results. The results were consistent among the different locations, and exhibited a correlation of $100 \%$ . The samples produced the expected results $100 \%$ of the time.

For the determination of intra-assay performance, 6 positive fecal specimens and 6 negative fecal specimens were analyzed. Each specimen was assayed in replicates of eight. All positives remained positive and all negatives remained negative.

The inter-assay precision of the SHIGA TOXIN CHEK test was determined using 12 fecal specimens (six negative, two positive for Stx1, two positive for Stx2, and two positive for both Stx1 and Stx2). The samples were tested, twice a day over a 5-day period using 2 different kit lots. A positive and negative control was run each day. All positives remained positive and all negatives remained negative.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: N/A   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): N/A

d. Detection limit:

From direct fecal testing

The limit of detection (LoD) for Stx1 was determined by using highly purified Stx1, and was defined as the concentration of toxin which yielded positive results $9 5 \%$ of the time, and negative results $5 \%$ of the time. The LoD was determined empirically by testing dilutions of Stx1 in a negative fecal pool, in replicates of 20. Using this method, the cutoff was found to be $0 . 2 8 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

A concentration of $0 . 2 7 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ was positive $50 \%$ of the time, and a concentration of $0 . 2 6 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ was negative $9 5 \%$ of the time.

The LoD for Stx2 was determined by using highly purified Stx2, and was defined as the concentration of toxin which yielded positive results $9 5 \%$ of the time, and negative results $5 \%$ of the time. The LoD was determined empirically by testing dilutions of Stx2 in a negative fecal pool, in replicates of 20. Using this method, the cutoff was found to be $0 . 2 3 0 { \mathrm { n g / m L } }$ . A concentration of $0 . 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ was positive $50 \%$ of the time, and a concentration of $0 . 1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ was negative $9 5 \%$ of the time.

# From broth culture

The limit of detection (LoD) for Stx1 was determined by using highly purified Stx1, and was defined as the concentration of toxin which yielded positive results $9 5 \%$ of the time, and negative results $5 \%$ of the time. The LoD was determined empirically by testing dilutions of Stx1 in overnight GN broth culture of non-toxin producing $E$ . Coli O157 (ATCC 043888), in replicates of 20. Using this method, the cutoff was found to be $0 . 1 8 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . A concentration of $0 . 1 2 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ was positive $50 \%$ of the time, and a concentration of $0 . 1 1 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ was negative $9 5 \%$ of the time.

The LoD for Stx2 was determined by using highly purified Stx2, and was defined as the concentration of toxin which yielded positive results $9 5 \%$ of the time, and negative results $5 \%$ of the time. The LoD was determined empirically by testing dilutions of Stx2 in overnight GN broth culture of nontoxin producing $E .$ . Coli O157 (ATCC 043888), in replicates of 20. Using this method, the cutoff was found to be $0 . 3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . A concentration of 0.200 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ was positive $50 \%$ of the time, and a concentration of $0 . 1 7 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ was negative $9 5 \%$ of the time.

4. Clinical cut-off:

N/A

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The SHIGA TOXIN CHEK test detects the presence of Stx1 and Stx2. Expected values for a particular population should be established by each laboratory. The positivity rate may be dependent upon a number of factors including geography, process of specimen collection, handling and transport, patient age.

Shiga toxin $E$ . coli is the source of an estimated 110,000 cases $0 . 0 4 \%$ of the population) of foodborne illness annually in the United States (11). Reported incidence rates in fecal samples submitted for testing range from $0 \% - 4 . 1 \%$ and vary depending upon the season, geographical location, and patient population, with higher incidence rates seen in the summer months and in preschool-aged children and the elderly (28). A positive result in the SHIGA TOXIN CHEK test confirms the presence of Shiga toxin in the sample; a negative result indicates the absence of toxin or insufficient levels of toxin for detection.
