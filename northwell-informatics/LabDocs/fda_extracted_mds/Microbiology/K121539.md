Cepheid Smart GBS Assay [510(k) #K062948]

# Device Description:

The Cepheid Xpert GBS LB Assay is an automated in vitro diagnostic DNA test for the qualitative detection of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) DNA from enriched vaginal/rectal swab specimens, using fully automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with fluorogenic detection of the amplified DNA. Xpert GBS LB Assay testing is indicated for identification of antepartum GBS colonization with vaginal/rectal swab specimens prepared using an enrichment method in LB broth and then tested in the Xpert GBS LB Ay  h nXp

The GeneXpert Instrument Systems automate and integrate sample lysis, nucleic acid purification and amplification, and detection of the target sequence in complex samples using real-time PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) assays. The GeneXpert Instrument System family comprises a GeneXpert Dx instrument (GX-I, GX-IV, GX-XVI), the GeneXpert Dx XVI available with 4, 8, 12, or 16 modules; a GeneXpert Infinity-48, available with 16, 24, 32, 40 or 48 modules, or a GeneXpert Infinity-80 available with 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, or 80 modules. The modules are identical for all instrument systems. The instrument systems also contain a computer, and preloaded software for running tests and viewing the results. The GeneXpert Infinity Systems contain robotic features for cartridge handling. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids, an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or spores, a valve drive for sample movement, and I-CORE $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and detection.

The Xpert GBS LB Assay includes reagents pre-loaded in the Xpert GBS LB cartridge for the simultaneous detection of the target GBS DNA. A Sample Processing Control (SPC), an Internal Control (IC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) are also included in the cartridge. The SPC is present to control for adequate processing of the target DNA; the IC is present to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the PCR reaction. The PCC verifies reagent rehydration, PCR-tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stabliy. The GBS primers and probe detect a target within a $3 ^ { \prime }$ DNA region adjacent to the cfb gene of S. agalactiae.

After collecting and transporting a swab sample to the laboratory, the swab is placed in Lim broth for enrichment overnight, after which a clean swab (Cepheid part number SDPS-120) dipped into the enrichment broth specimen is transferred to the designated chamber of the cartridge. The GeneXpert Instrument System performs sample preparation by eluting the specimen material from the swab, mixing the sample with the SPC (Bail oherei  rt, capturing cellular material on a filter, lysing the cells, and eluting the DNA. The DNA solution is then mixed with dry PCR reagents and transferred into the integrated reaction tube for real-time PCR and detection. The results are interpolated by the GeneXpert Instrument Systems from measured fluorescent signals and embedded calculation algorithms. Results may be viewed and printed. The test process takes approximately 55 minutes.Sample preparation, amplification, and real-time detection are all fullyautomated and completely integrated.

# Device Intended Use:

The Cepheid Xpert GBS LB Assay, performed on the GeneXpert® Instrument Systems, is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test designed to detect Group B Streptococcus (GBS) DNA from enriched vaginal/rectal swab specimens, using fully automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with fluorogenic detection of the amplified DNA. Xpert GBS LB Assay testing is indicated as an aid in determining GBS colonization status in antepartum women.

The Xpert GBS LB Assay is used for antepartum testing on enriched Lim broth cultures of vaginal/rectal swabs after 18-24 hours of incubation.

The Xpert GBS LB assay does not provide susceptibility results. Culture isolates are needed for performing susceptibility testing as recommended for penicillinallergic women.

# Substantial Equivalence:

The Xpert GBS LB Assay is substantially equivalent to Cepheid's Smart GBS Assay [510(k) #K062948]. Both assays detect Group B Streptococcus (GBS) DNA from enriched vaginal/rectal swab specimens. Both assays determine the presence of the target organisms through real-time PCR amplification and fluorogenic target-specific hybridization detection and utilize the same Cepheid I-CORE instrumentation format. Table 5.1 shows the similarities and differences between the Xpert GBS LB Assay and the predicate device.

A prospective multi-center study at three sites was conducted on 719 patients to determine the performance characteristics of the device on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems for detection of GBS colonization in antepartum women from vaginal/rectal swab specimens with Lim broth enrichment. Sensitivity and specificity of the Assay relative to reference culture were compared to the sensitivity and specificity of the predicate device, the Cepheid Smart GBS Assay, relative to reference culture. The test results showed the Xpert GBS LB Assay to be substantially equivalent to the Smart GBS predicate device and the reference culture, the current standard of care.

as determined in the Cepheid Clinical Study Comparing Xpert and Smart GBS Sensitivity and Specificity relative to culture.

# Non-Clinical Studies:

# Analytical Sensitivity (Limit of Detection)

Studies were performed to determine the analytical limit of detection (LoD) of 11 GBS strains representing nine known serotypes. All GBS strains used were procured from ATCC or CDC. The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration per sample that can be reproducibly distinguished from negative samples with $9 5 \%$ confidence or the lowest concentration at which 19 of 20 replicates were positive. Each strain was tested in replicates of 20 per concentration of bacteria.

The LoD was determined empirically as the lowest concentration that had 19/20 or 20/20 positive results. The LoD point estimates for each strain tested are summarized in Table 5.2. The overall LoD for the assay is $3 3 3 \mathrm { C F U / m L }$

# Analytical Specificity (Exclusivity)

The analytical specificity of the Xpert GBS LB Assay was evaluated by testing a panel of 100 strains representing 24 Streptococci, 76 other species including strains phylogenetically related to $S .$ agalactiae, other microflora (bacteria and yeasts) commonly found in vaginal/anal flora, and human DNA. Replicates of three were tested at concentrations of 4.5 to $9 . 5 { \times } 1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ or 1.7 - 3.2 McFarland units in Lim broth. The analytical specificity was $1 0 0 \%$ .

# Interfering Substances Study

In a non-clinical study, potentially interfering substances that may be present in vaginal/rectal specimens were evaluated directly relative to the performance of the Xpert GBS LB Assay. Potentially interfering endogenous and exogenous substances include, but are not limited to: human amniotic fluid, meconium, serum, urine, fecal material, human blood, lubricating gel, vaginal anti-itch medications, vaginal antifungal medications, anti-diarrheal medications, laxatives, stool softeners, topical hemorrhoid ointments, body oil, body powder, deodorant sprays, enema solutions, and spermicidal foam . Substances were tested at concentrations close to saturation. These substances are listed in Table 5.3 with active ingredients. None of the substances tested had a statistically significant effect on the assay performance. All positive samples were correctly reported as GBS Positive, and al negative samples were correctly reported as GBS Negative.

# Carry-Over Contamination Study

A study was conducted to demonstrate that single-use, self-contained Xpert GBS LB Assay cartridges prevent carry-over contamination in negative samples run following very high positive samples in the same GeneXpert module. The study consisted of a negative sample processed in the same GeneXpert module immediately following a very high GBS positive sample (roughly $1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / s w a b }$ Lim broth consisting of GBS serotype II or GBS serotype IV cells. This testing scheme was repeated 20 times on four GeneXpert modules for a total of 88 runs resulting in 40 positive and 48 negative specimens. All 40 positive samples were correctly reported as GBS. All 48 negative samples were correctly reported as GBS negative.

# Reproducibility

A panel of seven specimens with varying concentrations of 2 different GBS strains were tested by 2 operators each in triplicate on 5 different days at three sites (7 specimens x 2 operators x 3 times/ day $\texttt { x 5 }$ days $\texttt { x 3 }$ sites). One lot of Xpert GBS LB Assay was used at each of the 3 testing sites. The three levels were moderate positive (\~3-4X LOD), low positive $[ \mathord { \sim } 1 \mathrm { X }$ LOD) and high negative (below LOD). Xpert GBS LB Assays were performed on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems according to the Xpert GBS LB Assay procedure. Results are summarized in Table 5.4.

# Instrument System Precision

An in-house precision study was conducted to compare the performance of the GeneXpert Dx and the Infinity-80 instrument systems. A panel of seven specimens with varying concentrations of two different GBS strains was tested on 12 different days by two operators. Each operator conducted four runs of each panel specimen per day on each of the two instrument systems (7 specimens $\times 4$ times/ day x 12 days x 2 operators x 2 instrument systems).

# Linearity

A study was conducted to define the reportable range of the Xpert GBS LB Assay and demonstrate a linear relationship between target input and assay output.Linearity was evaluated using ten (10) GBS strains representing the nine (9) known serotypes that ranged in concentration from $1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ CFU/swab to 10 CFU/swab depending on the serotype. Replicates of 4 were tested at each concentration. Positive and negative controls for Xpert GBS LB were included in the study. The Xpert GBS LB Assay responds linearly over four to five logs ranging from $\mathrm { i x } 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ CFU/swab to 10 CFU/swab depending on the GBS serotype.

# Clinical Performance Characteristics

# Clinical Performance

Performance characteristics of the Xpert GBS LB Assay were evaluated at three institutions in the U.S. Subjects included individuals whose routine care called for collection of vaginal/rectal swab specimens for GBS testing. For eligible subjects, aliquots of leftover Lim broth sample were obtained for testing with the Xpert GBS LB Assay and reference culture testing, and patient management continued at the site per the standard practice. The Xpert GBS LB Assay performance was compared to culture.

Overall Results

A total of 826 specimens were tested for GBS by the Xpert GBS LB Assay, and culture. The Xpert GBS LB Assay demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity for detection GBS colonization of $9 9 . 0 \%$ and $9 2 . 4 \%$ respectively, relative to culture (Table 5.6).

Testing result by sequencing: 47 of 48 GBS specimens were sequenced, 42 were GBS positive, 5 were GBS negative and one Lim broth was not sequenced. Testing result by sequencing: 2 of2 GBS specimens were sequenced, both were GBS negative.

Xpert GBS LB Assays for $9 8 . 1 \%$ (810/826) of eligible specimens were successful on the first attempt. The indeterminate cases included twelve ERROR results, two INVALID results, and two NO RESULT outcomes. All of the 16 indeterminate cases were retested and yielded valid results upon repeat assay. The overall rate of assay success was $100 \%$ EPY (826/826).
