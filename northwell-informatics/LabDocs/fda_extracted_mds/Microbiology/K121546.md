# D. 510(k) Summary:

VITEK® 2 Gram Negative Doxycycline is designed for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Gramnegative bacilli. VITEK 2 GN Doxycycline is a quantitative test intended for use with the VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact Systems as a laboratory aid in the determination of in vitro susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. Doxycycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the microorganisms listed below, according to the FDA label for this antimicrobial.

# Active in vitro and in clinical infections

Acinetobacter species Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Klebsiella species Shigella species

The VITEK 2 Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) is intended to be used with the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems for the automated quantitative or qualitative susceptibiliy testing of isolated colonies for themost clinically significant aerobic gram-negative bacil,Staphylococcus spp. Enterococcus sp., Streptococcus spp., S. pneumoniae, and clinically significant yeast.

The antimicrobial presented in VITEK® 2 AST-GN Cards is in concentrations equivalent by efficacy to standard method concentrations in $\mu \rho / \mu \nu \iota$ . The VITEK® 2 AST Cards are essentially miniaturized versions of the doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) microdilution methodology.

The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration in $0 . 4 5 \cdot 0 . 5 0 \%$ saline before being u to ehydrate the antiicrobial medium within the card.The VITE® 2 automaticallyfills, seals an places the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK® 2 Compact has a manual filing and sealing operation. The VITEK® 2 monitors the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time (up to 18 hours).At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.

VITEK $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 2 GN Doxycycline demonstrated substantially equivalent performance when compared with the CLSI broth microdilution reference method, as defined in the FDA Class Il Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA. Issued August 28, 2009.

The Premarket Notification (510[k]) presents data in support of VITEK $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 2 GN Doxycycline. An external evaluation was conducted with fresh and stock clinical isolates, as well as a set of challenge strains. The external evaluations were designed to confirm the acceptability of VITEK® 2 GN Doxycycline by comparing its performance with the CLSI broth microdilution reference method incubated at 24 hrs. The data is representative of performance on both the VITEK® 2 and VITEK $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 2 Compact instrument platforms. VITEK $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 2 GN Doxycycline demonstrated acceptable performance of $9 7 . 6 \%$ overall Essential Agreement and $9 5 . 1 \%$ overall Category Agreement with the reference method. Reproducibility and Quality Control demonstrated acceptable results using both the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact instrument systems.

Dear Ms. Lin:

We have reviewed your Section 5 10(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with al the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address .
