# Predicate Device

Remel Xpect® Cryptosporidium (510K #: K031965)

# Device Description

The Trinity Biotech Uni-Gold™ Cryptosporidium Test was designed as a single use, rapid, lateral flow immunoassay to detect the presence of Cryptosporidium parvum antigen in unpreserved (fresh & frozen), preserved, and media containing human stool specimens.

y io $( 5 m m \times 6 0 m m )$ combines a nitrocellulose membrane with designated fiber pads (conjugate, sample and absorbant). The test strip is then placed into a plastic housing and is sealed constituting the Test Device.(Picture A)

Picture A- Cryptosporidium Test Strip - 5 mm x 60 mm

The Cryptosporidium nitrocellulose membrane test strip (above) consists of:

A)Mouse anti-Cryptosporidium parvum is coated onto the test line region of the test strip.

B)Goat anti-mouse IgG is coated onto the control line region of the test strip.

Mouse anti-Cryptosporidium parvum antibodies and Mouse IgG antibodies are conjugated to red latex particles and dried onto inert glass fiber (Conjugate pad), which is inserted into the test strip below the nitrocellulose zone.

When Cryptosporidium antigens are present in the sample they combine with the antibody/red latex. As this complex migrates it binds to the antibodies in the test region forming a visible pink/red band. Excess conjugate forms a second pink/red band in the control region of the device. The control line should always appear as a visible pink/red band in the control region of the device. The internal control line is to ensure and indicate that the test device is functioning correctly. This forms the basis for the double antibody sandwich assay.Pictu Picture B- Cryptosporidium Test Device

The test concept:

Mouse anti-Cryptosporidium parvum is coated onto the test line region of the nitrocellulose zone of the test strip. Goat anti-Mouse IgG is coated onto the control line region. Mouse anti-Cryptosporidium parvum and Mouse IgG antibodies are conjugated to red latex particles and dried onto inert glass fiber. This is inserted into the test strip below the nitrocellulose zone.

A buffered solution is added to a dilution tube followed by the addition of the stool specimen (2 drops) via a disposable pipette. This mixture is then dispensed in total into the sample well of the lateral flow cartridge device with a dropper pipette and migrates through a pad containing red microspheres that have been coated with a antibody specific for the Cryptosporidium antigen. If the antigen is present, an immune complex forms. The migration continues along the membrane, which contains a striped down anti Cryptosporidium capture antibody. If Cryptosporidium antigen is present, the immune complex reacts with the anti- Cryptosporidium antibody at the test line on the membrane. Thus Cryptosporidium antigens present in the sample combine with the antibody/red latex. As this complex migrates it binds to the antibodies in the test region forming a visible pink/red band.

Excess conjugate forms a second pink/red band in the control region of the device. The control line should always appear as a visible pink/red band in the control region of the device to indicate that the test device is functioning correctly.

# Comparison with Predicate Device:

The predicate device and the Uni-Gold ™m Cryptosporidium use similar lateral flow technology and concepts. The following table provides a comparative summary for both device design features. Any differences in technology do not raise additional concerns regarding safety and effectiveness. Safety and effectiveness are demonstrated to be.substantially equivalent.

# Precision / Reproducibility

An Intra-run precision/reproducibility study was performed at 3 sites including one internal site. This study consisted of 12 blind proficiency panel members, varying in reactivity: (4) Low Positive, (4) High Positive and (4) Negative samples. This panel was tested for a period of 5 days. Each site generated 2 runs per day, by two individual technicians totaling 20 replicates per site per panel member, i.e.60 replicates total for each panel member in entire 3 site study. $100 \%$ reproducibility was observed for all sites, for all days using the blind panel sample set, therefore $100 \%$ of the samples tested for Cryptosporidium produced the expected result.

Percent Correlation

The Trinity Biotech Uni-Gold ™ Cryptosporidium (1206620) along with Uni-Gold ™ Cryptosporidium Control kit (1206621) was evaluated at 3 external laboratories. A total of 299 retrospective samples were tested side by side on the test device and a commercially available lateral flow test at three external sites in the following stool matrix types: unpreserved frozen (37), Cary Blair (4), SAF (159), and formalin (99). The percent agreement of Uni-Gold™ Cryptosporidium versus the comparator device was as follows:

# Sensitivity / Specificity

The Trinity Biotech Uni-Gold™m Cryptosporidium (1206620) along with Uni-Gold™ Cryptosporidium Control kit (1206621) was evaluated at 4 external laboratories. The sensitivity and specificity of the test was compared against DFA microscopy with retrospective samples at sites 1 and 2 as shown in the following table.

Sensitivity: $100 \%$ (77/77) $9 5 \%$ CI 94 - 100% Specificity: $100 \%$ (157/157) $9 5 \%$ CI 97 - 100%

The positive samples were tested in the following stool matrix types: formalin (47), SAF (11), unpreserved frozen (14), Cary Blair (2), and C&S (3). The negative samples were tested in the following stool matrix types: formalin (71), SAF (49), unpreserved frozen (23), Cary Blair (2), C&S (12).

# Additional retrospective studies

Performance of the test was compared to non-fluorescent microscopy (staining) at two external laboratories. At site 2, 47 retrospective samples were evaluated and demonstrated a Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) of $100 \%$ (26/26) and a Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) of $100 \%$ (21/21) versus Modified Acid-Fast Stain. At site 3, 281 retrospective SAF samples were evaluated and demonstrated a PPA of $92 \%$ (55/60) and a NPA of $90 \%$ (198/221) versus Modified Kinyoun Stain. Of the 23 negative samples (by Modified Kinyoun Stain) that tested positive on the Uni-Gold Cryptosporidium test, three of these samples subsequently tested positive for Cryptosporidium by DFA microscopy in agreement with the Uni-Gold™ Cryptosporidium result.

# Prospective Study

The following table shows a summary of test performance compared against DFA microscopy with prospective samples at site 4.

Specificity: $100 \%$ (378/378) 95% CI 99 - 100%

Due to infection prevalence, no positive samples were encountered during this prospective study. Samples were tested in the following sample matrix types: unpreserved fresh (153), unpreserved frozen (45), formalin (45), SAF (45), C&S (45), and Cary Blair (45).

Expected Values   
The performance of the Uni-Gold™ Cryptosporidium Test Kit was evaluated at four external laboratories. The 940 (prospective and retrospective) samples were collected from Hospitals throughout the US and Canada and consisted of both male and female patients of all ages from pediatric to adult. The retrospective study included 163 positive samples and 399 negative samples confirmed by microscopy. The prospective study included 378 samples which were subsequently confirmed negative by microscopy. There were no differences observed in clinical performance between males or females, or between pediatric or adult populations.
