# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI M28-A2 Procedures for the Recovery and Identification of Parasites from the Intestinal Tract

# L. Test Principle:

A buffered solution is added to a dilution tube followed by the addition of two drops of the stool specimen via a disposable pipette. This mixture is then dispensed in total into the sample well of the lateral flow cartridge device with a dropper pipette. The mixture migrates through a pad containing red latex microspheres that have been coated with an antibody specific for the Cryptosporidium antigen.

When Cryptosporidium antigens are present in the sample they combine with the antibody/red latex conjugate. As this complex migrates it binds to the antibodies in the test region of the device forming a visible pink/red band.

Excess red latex conjugate forms a second pink/red band in the control region of the device. The control line should always appear as a visible pink/red band in the control region of the device to indicate that the test device is functioning correctly.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility was assessed at three sites using a blind coded sample panel with varying amounts of Cryptosporidium oocysts spiked into negative human stool matrix. The panel consisted of four low positive samples, four

moderately positive samples, and four negative samples. The panels were tested in two runs at each site by two operators each day for five days. Each site ran positive and negative controls for each day of testing. Reproducibility was $100 \%$ . Additionally, lot-to-lot repeatability and between-user repeatability were assessed internally with panels of positive and negative clinical samples. Repeatability was $100 \%$ . The Reproducibility and Repeatability study results are acceptable.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Controls:

Good Laboratory Practice necessitates the use of control specimens to ensure proper device performance at least once daily. Uni-Gold™ Cryptosporidium Controls are available separately for use only with Uni-Gold™ Cryptosporidium. These controls are used to verify correct device performance, operator procedure and result interpretation. The positive control will produce a reactive test result and the negative control will produce a nonreactive test result as described in the package insert.

It is recommended that positive and negative controls are run

By all new operators performing testing on patient specimens With each new kit lot and whenever a new shipment of test kits is received At periodic intervals as specified in the laboratory Quality Assurance program

Uni-Gold™ Cryptosporidium Controls must give the expected reactive or non-reactive results; otherwise the test results are not valid and must be repeated.

# Sample stability:

Cryptosporidium oocysts were spiked into human stool samples in the following fixative and transport medium types: $10 \%$ formalin, SAF, Cary Blair, C&S, or fresh (unpreserved). Negative samples were also prepared in each medium type. The samples were stored under different temperature conditions and tested at various times during storage. All samples produced the expected results. The data supports the following sample storage parameters:

Fresh stool 48 hours at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ Frozen Stool 2 months at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { \circ C } }$ Cary Blair or C&S transport media 7 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ Cary Blair or C&S transport media 2 months at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { \circ C } }$

A multiple freeze/thaw study was also conducted with negative and positive spiked fresh, C&S, and Cary Blair stool samples. All samples produced the expected results in the study. Multiple freeze/thaw cycles should be avoided.

# High-dose hook effect:

High levels of Cryptosporidium oocysts were spiked into negative human stool matrix, serially diluted, and then tested. High oocyst concentrations produced the expected positive results in the Uni-Gold Cryptosporidium and did not produce a high-dose hook effect.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of detection was determined by spiking purified Cryptosporidium oocysts quantified by DFA microscopy into negative human stool samples.

The samples were serially diluted and three replicates from each dilution were tested with the Uni-Gold Cryptosporidium to determine the concentration that produced a positive result $9 5 \%$ of the time. A limit of detection concentration of 9920 oocysts/mL was confirmed by testing an additional 20 replicates with the Uni-Gold Cryptosporidium.

\*At Site 3, out of 51 samples that tested positive on Uni-Gold Cryptosporidium and negative on the comparator device, 30 samples were positive by Modified Kinyoun Stain light microscopy and three samples were positive for Cryptosporidium by DFA microscopy in agreement with the UniGold Cryptoporidium result.

\*\*The one sample that tested negative on Uni-Gold Cryptosporidium and positive on the comparator device was negative by Modified Kinyoun Stain microscopy in agreement with the Uni-Gold Cryptoporidium result.

# b. Matrix comparison:

An in-house study was conducted to evaluate test performance with negative human stool samples and whole Cryptosporidium oocysts spiked into stool samples in the following sample matrices: $10 \%$ formalin, SAF, Cary Blair, C&S, and unpreserved (fresh). All samples produced the expected result with the test device.

3. Clinical studies:

The positive samples were tested in the following stool matrix types: formalin (47), SAF (11), unpreserved frozen (14), Cary Blair (2), and C&S (3). The negative samples were tested in the following stool matrix types: formalin (71), SAF (49), unpreserved frozen (23), Cary Blair (2), C&S (12).

# Additional retrospective studies:

Performance of the test was compared to non-fluorescent microscopy (staining) at two external laboratories. At site 2, 47 retrospective samples were evaluated and demonstrated a Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) of $100 \%$ (26/26) and a Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) of $100 \%$ (21/21) versus Modified Acid-Fast Stain. At site 3, 281 retrospective SAF samples were evaluated and demonstrated a PPA of $9 2 \%$ (55/60) and a NPA of $90 \%$ (198/221) versus Modified Kinyoun Stain. Of the 23 negative samples (by Modified Kinyoun Stain) that tested positive on the Uni-GoldTM Cryptosporidium test, three of these samples subsequently tested positive for Cryptosporidium by DFA microscopy in agreement with the Uni-GoldTM Cryptosporidium result.

# Prospective study

Test performance was compared against DFA microscopy at site 4 with 378 prospective samples in the following stool sample types: fresh (153), frozen (45), $10 \%$ formalin (45), SAF (45), C&S (45), and Cary Blair (45). Due to infection prevalence, no positive samples were encountered during this study.
