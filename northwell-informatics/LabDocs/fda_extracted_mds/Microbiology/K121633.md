BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of RSV

Antigens Cf (including Cf Controls) Respiratory Syncytial Virus

DEVICE CLASSIFICATION:

21 CFR $\ S$ 866.3480

PREDICATE DEVICES:

Quidel QuickVue RSV 10 test

INTENDED USE:

The BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a chromatographic immunoassay with an instrumented read for the direct and qualitative detection of RSV fusion protein from nasopharyngeal washes/aspirates and nasopharyngeal swabs in transport media from patients suspected of having a viral respiratory infection. This test is intended for in vitro diagnostic use to aid in the diagnosis of RSV infections in infants and pediatric patients under the age of 20 years. Negative results do not preclude RsV infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or for other management decisions. A negative test is presumptive. It is recommended that negative test results be confirmed by viral cell culture or an alternative method, such as a FDA-cleared molecular assay. The test is intended for professional and laboratory use. It is to be used in conjunction with the BD Veritor™M System Reader.

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

The BD RSV test is a chromatographic assay to qualitatively detect RSV fusion protein in samples processed from respiratory specimens. The processed specimen is added to the test device where RSV viral antigens bind to anti-RSV antibodies conjugated to detector particles on the RSV test strip. The antigen-conjugate complex migrates across the test strip to the reaction area and is captured by an antibody line on the membrane. Results are interpreted by the BD Veritor ™ System Reader, a portable electronic device which uses a reflectance-based measurement method to evaluate the line signal intensities on the assay test strip, and applies specific algorithms to determine the presence or absence of any target analyte(s). A liquid crystal display (LCD) on the instrument communicates the results to the operator.

# Media Compatibility

Different types of transport media commonly used for the preservation and transport of respiratory specimens were evaluated for compatibility with the BD Veritor ™ System for Rapid Detection of RSV test. The effects of frozen storage of transport media samples on the stability of the antigen were also evaluated in this study by storing them for 24 hours at $- 2 0 \pm 5 ^ { \circ } C$ The media tested were: Amies, Bartel ViraTrans, BD Universal, Earle's Minimal Essential, Hank's Balanced Salts, M4, M4-RT, M5, M6, Normal Saline, and Phosphate Buffered Saline. No interference or compatibility issues were seen.

# CLINICAL STUDIES

Performance characteristics for the BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of RSV test were established in multi-center clinical studies conducted at five U.S. trial sites during the 2011-2012 respiratory season. A total of 1174 prospectively collected specimens received in the laboratory with an order for respiratory virus testing were enrolled in the study, of which, 26 were noncompliant with the study protocol and one was noncompliant on the viral cell culture reference testing level. Removal of these specimens yields a total of 1147 specimens. One additional specimen had a final undetermined viral cell culture reference result which could not be verified. Removal of this specimen results in a total of 1146 specimens. A total of 1146 were evaluated using the BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of RSV test and viral cell culture. The prospective specimens consisted of 440 Nasopharyngeal Wash /Aspirates (NPWA) and 706 nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) in transport media from symptomatic patients. $4 4 . 3 \%$ of the samples were from females and $5 5 . 7 \%$ from males. $80 \%$ of patients were 2 years and under.

The performance of the BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of RSV test was compared to an FDA cleared $D ^ { 3 }$ Duet™ DFA on R-Mix cell culture and is presented in the following tables

# Reproducibility

The reproducibility of the BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of RSV test was evaluated at three clinical laboratory sites. The reproducibility panel was composed of 12 simulated RSV samples. These included moderate positive samples, low positive samples (near the assay limit of detection), and high negative samples (i.e., containing very low concentrations of virus) and negative samples. The panel was tested by two operators at each site for five consecutive days. The results are summarized below.

Dear Mr. Payne:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class ⅡI (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with al the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21

Page 2 - Gregory P. Payne, RAC

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.
