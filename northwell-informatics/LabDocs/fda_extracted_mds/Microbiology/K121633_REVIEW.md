# I. Device Description:

The BD RSV test is a chromatographic assay to qualitatively detect RSV fusion protein in samples processed from respiratory specimens. The patient specimen is mixed in a prefilled unitized tube containing mucolytic agents that function to break down mucus in a patient specimen thereby exposing viral antigens. The processed specimen is added to the test device where RSV viral antigens bind to anti-RSV antibodies conjugated to detector particles on the RSV test strip. The antigen-conjugate complex migrates across the test strip to the reaction area and is captured by an antibody line on the membrane. Results are interpreted by the BD Veritor™ System Reader, a portable electronic device which uses a reflectancebased measurement method to evaluate the line signal intensities on the assay test strip, and applies specific algorithms to determine the presence or absence of any target analyte(s). A liquid crystal display (LCD) on the instrument communicates the results to the operator.

# L. Test Principle:

The BD Veritor™ System RSV test is a chromatographic assay to qualitatively detect RSV viral fusion protein in respiratory specimens. The patient specimen is mixed in a prefilled unitized tube containing RV Reagent C and added to the test device. RV Reagent C contains mucolytic agents that function to break down mucus in a patient specimen thereby exposing viral antigens and enhancing detection in the assay device. Processed specimens are expressed through a filter tip into a single sample well on the BD VeritorTM System RSV test device.

The specimen is mixed and added to the test device where RSV antigens bind to antirespiratory syncytial antibodies conjugated to detector particles on the BD Veritor™ System RSV test strip. The antigen-conjugate complex migrates across the test strip to the reaction area and is captured by an antibody line on the membrane. The assay utilizes a proprietary enhanced colloidal-gold particle at the test lines as the means for identifying the presence of RSV viral antigens.

The BD Veritor™ System RSV test devices are designed with four spatially-distinct zones including positive and negative control line positions, test line for the target analyte, and a background zone. The test line for the target analyte is labeled on the test device as ‘T’ for test position. The onboard positive control ensures the sample has flowed correctly and is indicated on the test device as $^ { \circ } C '$ . Two of the four distinct zones on the test device are not labeled. These two zones are an onboard negative control line and an assay background zone. The onboard negative control zone addresses non-specific signal generation and is not labeled on the test device. The remaining zone is used to measure the assay background and

is also not labeled.

The BD Veritor™ System RSV assay incorporates an active negative control feature in each test to identify and compensate for sample-related, nonspecific signal generation. The BD Veritor™ System Reader uses a proprietary algorithm which subtracts nonspecific signal at the negative control line from the signal present at the test line. If the resultant test line signal is above a pre-selected assay cutoff, the specimen is scored as positive. If the resultant test line signal is below the cutoff, the specimen is scored as negative. Use of the active negative control feature allows the BD Veritor™ System reader to correctly interpret test results that cannot be scored visually because the human eye is unable to accurately perform the subtraction of the nonspecific signal.

The BD Veritor™ System Reader measures the amount of light reflected from various zones along the assay strip. The measurement of the assay background zone is an important factor during test interpretation as the reflectance is compared to that of the control and test zones. A background area that is white to light pink indicates the device has performed correctly. The instrument analyzes the reflectance data to provide the proper interpretation.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A study was conducted over a period of 12 days with two different operators in order to evaluate the precision of the BD RSV test. Each day, each operator tested a group of 20 swab samples that were blinded and randomized and included negatives and positives $( \sim 5 \%$ positive, ${ \sim } 9 5 \%$ positive and $100 \%$ positive). These specimens were prepared by dipping the swabs into various dilutions of virus and then letting them dry. All positive and negative swab specimens were masked and randomized prior to testing with the BD RSV test. The procedure in the package insert for the swab control was followed. To extract the viral material from the swab the sample was inserted into a unitized tube and plunged up and down for 15 seconds. The swab was then removed while squeezing the tube to expel the excess liquid and the attached filter tip was snapped in place. The processed sample was mixed and three drops were added to the sample well of the BD RSV device. After 10 minutes at room temperature the device was inserted into the BD Veritor™ System Reader for interpretation.

The reproducibility of the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of RSV test was evaluated at three clinical laboratory sites. The reproducibility panel was composed of 12 simulated RSV samples that were prepared in the same manner as for the precision study. The panel included moderate positive samples, low positive samples, high negative samples and negative samples. The panels were masked and randomized by BD prior to shipment to the clinical trial sites. Each site had two operators and each operator tested each panel for five consecutive days, resulting in a total of 60 samples tested per operator and 120 samples per site.

# g. Specimen storage and stability:

Transport media listed in the Table below were evaluated for specimen storage and stability with the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of RSV test. Testing was performed using two RSV strains (Long subgroup A and 9320 subgroup B). Each transport medium was spiked with RSV virus at 4-5XLoD and used for testing on Day 1, Day 2, Day 3 and Day 4. $3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the spiked media were added to a unitized tube containing RV Reagent C. The attached filter tip was snapped into place, the suspension was mixed and three drops were added to the sample well of the BD Veritor™ System RSV device. After 10 minutes at room temperature the device was inserted into the BD Veritor™ System Reader for interpretation. Each transport media was tested on three different BD Veritor™ System RSV devices. The remaining volume of each spiked transport media were stored in a refrigerator (2- $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and tested again on Day 2, Day 3 and Day 4. No virus stability issues were noted for any of the transport medium spiked with RSV Strain Long and RSV Strain 9320 when stored for up to 3 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

b. Matrix comparison:

Transport media compatibility:

Various transport media commonly used for the preservation and transport of respiratory specimens were evaluated for compatibility with the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of RSV test. The effects of frozen storage of transport media samples on the stability of the antigen were also evaluated in this study. Unspiked transport media were tested to determine if any of the media displayed compatibility issues (generation of a false positive or background problems) with the BD Veritor™ System RSV test. $3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of non-frozen media were added to a unitized tube containing RV Reagent C and the attached filter tip was snapped into place. The suspension was mixed and three drops were added to the sample well of the BD Veritor™ System RSV device. After 10 minutes at room temperature the device was inserted into the BD Veritor™ System Reader for interpretation. Additionally, each media type was subjected to one freeze/thaw cycle and then tested in triplicate to evaluate effects of overnight storage at $- 2 0 \pm 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Testing was performed as described above for the non-frozen media. Similarly, the RSV positive samples were evaluated to assure no interference was caused by any of the media (generation of a false negative) in the assay. Positive samples were prepared by diluting stock concentrations of an RSV antigen suspension to a concentration correlating to a weak positive. No compatibility issues were noted for any of the media tested at room temperature with either unspiked or spiked samples.

Matrix comparison:

An additional matrix comparison study was conducted to evaluate matrix effects on the assay’s sensitivity. The matrix effect study was designed using two RSV strains VR-26 (Long subgroup A) and VR-955 (9320 subgroup B) which were serially diluted in BD Universal Transport Media (UTM) and in a negative pooled wash/aspirate matrix (pool of around 70 specimens). LoD was determined using a minimum of 20 replicates. The results of the study showed that there were no significant differences in the LoD between the two matrices tested, UTM and negative clinical wash/aspirate matrix.

# 3. Clinical studies:

Performance characteristics for the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of RSV test were established in multi-center clinical studies conducted at five U.S. trial sites during the 2011-2012 respiratory season. A total of 1174 prospectively collected specimens received in the laboratory with an order for respiratory virus testing were enrolled in the study, of which, 26 were noncompliant with the study protocol and inclusion criteria and one was noncompliant on the viral cell culture reference testing level. Removal of these specimens yields a total of 1147 specimens. One additional specimen had a final undetermined viral cell culture reference result which could not be verified. Removal of this specimen results in a total of 1146 specimens. A total of 1146 were evaluated using the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of RSV test and viral cell culture. The prospective specimens consisted of 440 Nasopharyngeal Wash /Aspirates (NPWA) and 706 nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) in transport media from symptomatic patients. $4 4 . 3 \%$ of the samples were from females and $5 5 . 7 \%$ from males. $80 \%$ of patients were 2 years and under.

For testing specimens with the BD Veritor™ System RSV test, sites were instructed to follow the procedural instructions outlined in the draft package insert. Briefly, NP wash/aspirate specimens and NP swab in transport media specimens were vortexed or thoroughly mixed and $3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the specimen was transferred into the unitized tube containing RV Reagent C using the disposable volumetric pipette. The attached filter tip was snapped in place, the contents were mixed by agitating the tube, and three drops of the mixture were added to the sample well of the BD Veritor™ System RSV device. After 10 minutes at room temperature the device was inserted into the BD Veritor™ System Reader for result interpretation. Visual interpretation of results was not permitted from the device.

The performance of the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of RSV test was compared to viral cell culture followed by DFA using an FDA cleared $\mathrm { D } ^ { 3 }$ Duet DFA Influenza A/ Respiratory virus screening test. The data were tabulated using the reference method results to categorize the BD RSV test results into the following categories:

1. True Positive: Any BD RSV test result which exhibits a positive result and has a reference positive result shall be deemed a true positive.   
2. False Positive: Any BD RSV test result which exhibits a positive result but the reference result is negative shall be deemed a false positive.   
3. True Negative: Any BD RSV test result which exhibits a negative result for which the reference result is negative shall be deemed a true negative.   
4. False Negative: Any BD RSV test result that exhibits a negative result but for which the reference result is positive shall be deemed false negative.

4. Clinical cut-off:

Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The rate of positivity observed in RSV testing will vary depending on the method of specimen collection, handling/transport system employed, detection method utilized, time of year, age of the patient, geographic location and most importantly, local disease prevalence. In the 2011/2012 clinical trial, the overall prevalence of RSV as determined by viral cell culture for the NP swabs in transport media was $2 4 . 5 \%$ (range of $5 . 6 \%$ to $3 1 . 8 \%$ . The overall prevalence of RSV as determined by viral cell culture for the NPWA specimens was $3 7 . 7 \%$ (range of $1 0 . 5 \%$ to $4 9 . 6 \%$ ).

# N. Instrument Name:

BD Veritor™ System Reader

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

The Veritor™ System Reader is a small, battery powered, bench top instrument that is used to read the Veritor lateral flow test cassette. After the extracted patient sample has been added to the test cassette, the test is developed at room temperature for 10 minutes. The cassette is then placed into the reader where it is scanned. The cassette is divided into distinct zones where the analyzer reads the negative background, positive control, and the Influenza A and B specific zones. The reader applies an algorithm to determine the background of the test as well as the specific signal from the A or B test zones. The reader has a finite number of reads and will prompt the end-user as the total number of reads approaches the lifetime of the unit.

# 2. Software:

The Veritor™ System Reader is the identical instrument that has been reviewed and cleared with the BD influenza A and B assay k112277. FDA has reviewed applicant’s instrument Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this instrument. Please refer to decision summary for k112277.

Yes __ X___ or No

3. Specimen Identification: Not Applicable

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling: Not Applicable

5. Calibration:

The Veritor™ Reader is not configurable by the end user and is designed to have a finite lifetime based on number of tests performed or shelf life from date of manufacture. Device calibration is not required, however, a verification device is provided with the reader to monitor the device function.

6. Quality Control:

Each BD Veritor™ System RSV test strip is designed with spatially-distinct zones containing a positive and negative internal control. The positive control zone ensures that the sample has flowed correctly, and the negative control zone serves to address nonspecific signal generation. The BD Veritor™ System Reader determines the line intensity at each of the spatially-defined control zones and utilizes specific algorithms to determine the presence or absence of any target analyte. The BD Veritor™ System Reader must be used to read the BD Veritor™ RSV test devices, as these devices cannot be interpreted visually by the user.

In addition to the two internal controls, each BD RSV kit contains the following external controls:

1. Control $^ +$ is a dry swab control that may be used as an external control. A positive RSV test result on the reader LCD display confirms that the operator performed the test correctly.   
2. Control − is a dry swab control that may be used as an external control. A negative RSV test result on the reader LCD display confirms that the operator performed the test correctly.

At a minimum, the external dry swab controls should be run as a quality control procedure for each new lot and new shipment received. Controls should be tested in accordance with local, state and/or federal regulations or accreditation requirements and the standard Quality Control procedures. If desired, appropriate reagent performance and proper testing technique may also be determined by using specimens qualified as positive or negative for the RSV virus. The user is instructed not to use the BD Veritor™ System RSV test if control $^ +$ and control do not yield appropriate results.
