# Device Description:

The Xpert CT/NG Assay is an automated in vitro diagnostic test for qualitative detection and differentiation of DNA from Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG). The assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert Instrument Systems. The GeneXpert Instrument Systems automate and integrate sample purification, nucleic acid amplification, and detection of the target sequences in simple or complex samples using real-time PCR and RT-PCR assays. The systems consist of an instrument, personal computer, and preloaded software for running the tests on collected samples and viewing the results. The system requires the use of single-use disposable cartridges that hold the PCR reagents and host the PCR process. Because the cartridges are selfcontained, cross-contamination between cartridges during the testing process is minimized.

The Xpert CT/NG Assay includes reagents for the $5 "$ exonuclease real-time PCR detection and differentiation of CT and NG. Reagents for the detection of a Sample Processing Control (SPC), a Sample Adequacy Control (SAC), and a Probe Check Control (PCC) are also included in the cartridge. The SPC is present to control for adequate processing of the target bacteria and to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the PCR reaction. The SAC reagents detect the presence of a single copy human gene and monitor whether the specimen contains human DNA. The PCC verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability. The primers and probes in the Xpert CT/NG Assay detect chromosomal sequences in the bacteria. One target is detected for CT (CT1) and two different targets are detected for NG (NG2 and NG4). Both NG targets need to be positive for the Xpert CT/NG Assay to return a positive NG result.

The GeneXpert Instrument Systems, comprised of the GeneXpert Dx Systems, the GeneXpert Infinity-48 System and the GeneXpert Infinity-80 System, have 1 to 80 randomly accessible modules, depending upon the instrument, that are each capable of performing separate sample preparation and real-time PCR tests. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids (i.e., the syringe drive activates the plunger that works in concert with the rotary valve in the cartridge to move fluids between chambers), an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or spores, and a proprietary I-CORE $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and detection.

The ancillary specimen collection kits for use with the Xpert CT/NG Assay are the Cepheid® Xpert® CT/NG Vaginal/Endocervical Specimen Collection Kit and the Cepheid® Xpert® CT/NG Urine Specimen Collection Kit.

# Analytical Sensitivity (Limit of Detection)

Studies were performed to determine the analytical limit of detection (LoD) of the Xpert CT/NG Assay with purified CT elementary bodies seeded into negative natural human pooled vaginal swab and pooled male urine matrices, and NG cells seeded into negative pooled simulated swab and pooled male urine matrices.

# Pooled Vaginal Swab Matrix

Elementary bodies from two CT serovars, ATCC vr885 serovar D and ATCC vr879 serovar H, were purified by centrifugation through a $30 \%$ sucrose cushion and titered by enumeration of elementary bodies by transmission electron microscopy. Each serovar was diluted into pooled negative vaginal swab matrix and tested with the Xpert CT/NG Assay. Replicates of 20 were evaluated at eight concentrations for CT serovar D and at seven concentrations for CT serovar H and LoDs were estimated by probit analysis. The claimed LoDs were confirmed by analyzing at least 20 replicate samples with elementary bodies diluted to the estimated LoD concentrations. For this study, the claimed LoD is defined as the lowest concentration at which $9 5 \%$ of at least 20 replicates are positive.

The claimed LoD for purified CT serovar D elementary bodies in vaginal swab matrix is 84 EB/mL. The claimed LoD for purified CT serovar H elementary bodies in vaginal swab matrix is 161 EB/mL (Table 3). In this study, LoDs for the remaining purified CT serovars (in $\mathrm { E B / m L }$ ) are A (600), B (6), Ba (1900), C (34), E (6), F (202), G (96), I (21), J (150), K (117), LGV I (31), LGV II (20) and LGV III (210) $\mathrm { E B / m L }$ .

Two NG strains (ATCC 19424 and ATCC 49226) were tested. Replicates of 20 were evaluated at six concentrations. The LoD was estimated by probit analysis.

The LoD for NG, estimated by probit analysis, is $1 . 5 - 1 . 6 \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ in a simulated swab matrix background (Table 4). An additional 30 NG strains were tested in a simulated matrix and the LoD was confirmed by testing replicates of three at or near the LoD.

# Pooled Male Urine Matrix

Purified and titered elementary bodies from two CT serovars, ATCC vr885 serovar D and ATCC vr879 serovar H, were each tested in a sample matrix of negative pooled male urine. Replicates of 20 were evaluated at eight concentrations for CT serovar D and at seven concentrations for CT serovar H and LoDs were estimated by probit analysis. The claimed LoDs were confirmed by analyzing at least 20 replicate samples with elementary bodies diluted to the estimated LoD concentrations. For this study, the claimed LoD is defined as the lowest concentration at which $9 5 \%$ of at least 20 replicates are positive.

The claimed LoD for purified CT serovar D elementary bodies in male urine matrix is 75 $\mathrm { E B / m L }$ . The claimed LoD for purified CT serovar H elementary bodies in male urine matrix is $1 3 4 ~ \mathrm { E B / m L }$ (Table 5). In this study, LoDs for the remaining purified CT serovars (in $\mathrm { E B / m L }$ ) are A (900), B (11), Ba (3037), C (34), E (12), F (151), G (48), I (43), J (112), K (88), LGV I (31), LGV II (40) and LGV III (157).

Two NG strains, ATCC 19424 and ATCC 49226, were tested in a sample matrix of negative pooled male urine. Replicates of 20 were evaluated at six concentrations. The LoD was estimated by probit analysis.

The LoD for NG, estimated by probit analysis, is $1 . 2 - 2 . 7 \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ in a male urine matrix background (Table 6). LoD for 30 additional NG strains was confirmed by testing replicates of three at or near the LoD.

# Carry-Over Contamination Study

A study was conducted to demonstrate that single-use, self-contained GeneXpert cartridges prevent carry-over contamination in negative samples run following very high positive samples in the same GeneXpert module. The study consisted of a negative sample processed in the same GeneXpert module immediately following a sample with high CT spike $\mathrm { 1 . 9 \times 1 0 ^ { 4 } ~ E B / m L ) }$ and a high NG spike $( 5 . 2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ \ ' 1 0 ^ { 5 } ~ C F U / m L } )$ . Two sample types were used for this testing: a) known pooled negative urine samples; and b) known pooled negative swab samples. Each sample type was tested in each of four GeneXpert modules for a total of 44 runs for both swab and urine samples resulting in 20 positives and 24 negatives. All 40 positive samples were correctly reported as CT DETECTED;NG DETECTED. Al 48 negative samples were correctly reported as CT NOT DETECTED;NG NOT DETECTED.

# Clinical Performance Characteristics:

# Reproducibility

Reproducibility of the Xpert CT/NG Assay was evaluated at three sites using specimens comprised of CT and NG organisms seeded into pooled, negative male urine (urine matrix) or in pooled, negative female vaginal swab samples (swab matrix). The specimens were prepared at concentration levels representing low positive (1X LoD), moderate positive (2-3X LoD), and high positive $( > 2 0 \mathrm { x }$ LoD) for each organism. Negative panel members were also included, and were comprised of pooled, negative male urine and pooled, negative vaginal swab samples. A panel of 22 specimens (1 1 in urine matrix and 1 1 in swab matrix) was tested on five different days by two different operators four times per day at three sites (22 specimens $\tt { x 2 }$ operators/day x 5 days x 4 replicates per day x 3 sites). Three lots of Xpert CT/NG reagents were included in the study, with two lots being tested at each site. Xpert CT/NG Assays were performed according to the Xpert CT/NG Assay procedure. The rate of agreement with expected results of CT and NG for each panel member is presented in Tables 10 and 1 1.

# Instrument System Precision

An in-house precision study was conducted to compare the performance of the GeneXpert Dx and the Infinity-80 Instrument Systems using specimens comprised of CT and NG organisms seeded into negative urine (urine matrix) or diluent for the Xpert CT/NG Assay (swab matrix). The specimens were prepared at concentration levels representing low positive (0.25-0.5X LoD), moderate positive (2-3X LoD), and high positive (>20X LoD) for each organism. Negative panel members were also included and were comprised of negative urine and negative diluent. A panel of 20 specimens (10 in urine matrix and 10 in swab matrix) was tested on 12 different days by two operators. Each operator conducted four runs of each panel specimen per day on each of the two instrument systems (20 specimens x 4 times/ day x 12 days $_ { \textrm { x 2 } }$ operators $\mathbf { x } \ : 2$ instrument systems). One lot of Xpert CT/NG Assay was used for the study. Xpert CT/NG assays were performed according to the Xpert CT/NG Assay procedure. The rate of agreement with expected results of CT and NG for each panel member is presented by instrument in Tables 15 and 16.

# Clinical Performance Study

Performance characteristics of the Xpert CT/NG Assay were determined in a multi-site prospective investigational study at 36 US and UK institutions by comparing the Xpert CT/NG Assay to a patient infected status (PIS) algorithm based on combined results from two currently marketed NAAT tests.

Study participants included consenting asymptomatic and symptomatic, sexually active males and females seen at locations including, but not limited to: OB/GYN, sexually transmitted disease (STD), teen, public health, and family planning clinics. The average age among female study participants was 30.3 years (range $= 1 4$ to 83 years); the average age among male study participants was 37.7 years (range $= 1 7$ to 74 years).

The study specimens consisted of prospectively collected male urine, female urine, endocervical swabs, urethral swabs and patient-collected vaginal swabs (collected in a clinical setting).

A female study participant was categorized as infected (I) by PIS for CT or NG if at least one positive result was reported from each reference NAAT test. If both NAAT tests resulted in equivocal results for both sample types (swab and urine) the PIS status was defined as equivocal (EQ). This is the only scenario for an overall PIS of EQ; no study participants fell into this category for this study. Female study participants with positive results on both reference urine specimens and negative results on both reference swab specimens were categorized as infected (I) for urine and not infected (Nl) for the swab specimen. Any other combination of results was categorized as not infected (NI).

A male study participant was categorized as infected (I) by PIS for CT or NG if at least one positive result was reported from each reference NAAT test. If both NAAT tests resulted in equivocal results for both sample types (swab and urine) the PIS status was defined as equivocal (EQ). This is the only scenario for an overall PIS of EQ; no study participants fell into this category for this study. Any other combination of results was categorized as not infected (NI).

Performance of the Xpert CT/NG Assay was calculated relative to the PIS for each of the three female sample types (endocervical swabs, self-collected vaginal swabs and urine), and male urine.

During the clinical evaluation of the Xpert CT/NG Assay, a total of 212 female subjects were infected with CT. Symptoms were reported in $4 1 . 0 \%$ (87/212) of infected and $3 4 . 1 \%$ (1221/3579) non-infected female subjects. A total of 54 female subjects were infected with NG. Symptoms were reported in $5 3 . 7 \%$ (29/54) of infected and $3 4 . 1 \%$ EY (1273/3729) non-infected female subjects. A total of 196 male subjects were infected with CT. Symptoms were reported in $6 2 . 8 \%$ (123/196) of infected and $1 8 . 0 \%$ (584/3248) non-infected male subjects. A total of 1 19 male subjects were infected with NG. Symptoms were reported in $8 9 . 1 \%$ (106/1 19) of infected and $1 8 . 1 \%$ (601/3325) noninfected male subjects.

Among the 14,790 tests performed, 416 had to be retested due to ERROR, INVALID or NO RESULT outcomes $( 2 . 8 1 \%$ $9 5 \%$ CI 2.56-3.09). Of those, 355 specimens yielded valid results upon repeat assay (18 specimens were not retested). The overall valid reporting rate of the assay was $9 9 . 6 \%$ (14,729/14,790).

Hypothetical estimated positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) for different prevalence rates using Xpert CT/NG Assay are shown in Tables 26 through 29 below. These calculations are based on a hypothetical prevalence and the overall sensitivity and specificity (compared to the patient infected status) observed during the Xpert CT/NG for a multi-center clinical study (Tables 20 and 21).

In patient-collected vaginal swab specimens, the overall sensitivity and specificity for CT were $9 9 . 5 \%$ and $9 9 . 1 \%$ , respectively (Table 20). The overall sensitivity and specificity for NG were $1 0 0 \%$ and $9 9 . 9 \%$ , respectively (Table 21).

Dear Dr. Flom:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to'additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
