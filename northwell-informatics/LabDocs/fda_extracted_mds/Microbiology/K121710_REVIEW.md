# I. Device Description:

The Xpert CT/NG Assay is a rapid, automated in vitro diagnostic test for qualitative detection and differentiation of DNA from Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG). The assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert Instrument Systems. The GeneXpert Instrument Systems automate and integrate sample purification, nucleic acid amplification, and detection of the target sequences in urogenital samples using real-time PCR for gene specific sequence amplification.

The GeneXpert Instrument Systems, comprised of the GeneXpert Dx System, the GeneXpert Infinity-48 System and the GeneXpert Infinity-80 System, have 1 to 80 randomly accessible modules, depending upon the instrument, that are each capable of performing sample preparation and real-time PCR tests individually for each patient. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids (i.e., the syringe drive activates the plunger that works in concert with the rotary valve in the cartridge to move fluids between chambers), an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or spores, and a proprietary I-CORE® thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and detection.

The system consists of an instrument, personal computer, and preloaded software for running the tests on collected samples and viewing the results. The system is designed to minimize cross-contamination during the testing process by the use of assay specific single-use disposable cartridges that hold the PCR reagents and host the PCR process.

The Xpert CT/NG Assay includes reagents for the $5 ^ { \circ }$ exonuclease real-time PCR detection and differentiation of CT and NG. Reagents for the detection of a Sample Processing Control (SPC), a Sample Adequacy Control (SAC), and a Probe Check Control (PCC) are also included in the cartridge. The SPC is present to control for adequate processing of the target bacteria and to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the PCR reaction. The SAC reagents detect the presence of a single copy human gene and monitor whether the specimen contains human DNA. The PCC verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability. The primers and probes in the Xpert CT/NG Assay detect chromosomal sequences in the bacteria.

The Xpert CT/NG Assay is designed for use with genital and urine specimens (firstcatch male urine, female urine, endocervical specimens and vaginal swab specimens) collected in specific Urine and Endocervical /Vaginal Specimen Collection kits designed to preserve patient specimens to allow transport to the laboratory for analysis with Xpert CT/NG Assay and GeneXpert Instrument System. The specimen is briefly mixed and transferred to the sample chamber of the Xpert CT/NG cartridge using the supplied transfer pipette. The provided Binding Reagent is manually added into the designated chamber of the Xpert CT/NG cartridge. The cartridge is loaded onto the GeneXpert Instrument System platform, which performs hands-off, automated sample processing, and real-time PCR for detection of DNA. Test results are obtained in approximately 90 minutes and are displayed in tabular and graphic formats.

# L. Test Principle:

Detection of the amplified DNA is by fluorogenic target-specific probe hybridization followed by $5 '$ -nuclease cleavage of the probe to release the fluorophore. The primers and probes in the Xpert CT/NG Assay are designed to amplify and detect one unique chromosomal gene sequence for Chlamydia trachomatis and two unique chromosomal gene sequences for Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

The GeneXpert Instrument Systems perform hands-off, automated sample preparation by first mixing the sample with Lysis Reagent and then taking the mixture to re-suspend the Sample Processing Control in the form of a lyophilized bead within the cartridge. Lysis of bacterial cells with Lysis Reagent is followed by mixing with Binding Reagent which allows capture of the nucleic acids on the glass fiber column. The column is then washed to remove contaminants and finally, the purified nucleic acids are eluted with an elution reagent. The nucleic acid solution is mixed with dry real-time PCR reagents and transferred into the PCR tube for real-time PCR and detection of chromosomal DNA gene sequences for Chlamydia trachomatis and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae. During real time-PCR cycling, optical signals from five (5) sequence specific fluorescent probes within the reaction are monitored in real time. The probes correspond to the one CT and two NG targets, SAC target and the SPC target.

# Controls:

# Internal Controls:

The Xpert CT/NG Assay includes three internal controls contained in each cartridge:

· The Probe Check Control (PCC) performs a check on the amplification portion of the assay. It controls for missing or incompletely hydrated beads of enzyme and target specific reagent. It also controls for the generated fluorescence which must meet internal acceptance criteria. The Sample Processing Control (SPC) contains DNA from Bacillus globigii and verifies the sample processing and target amplification. The Sample Adequacy Control (SAC) ensures that the sample contains human cells and that the cells are adequately lysed in order to extract nucleic acids.

Additionally, the GeneExpert Instrument performs a System Control Check for Temperature. This check ensures that the instrument is operating within validated heating and cooling specifications.

# External Controls:

External Controls are not included with the kit and must be obtained by the user.

Interpretation of Results:

The results are interpolated by the GeneXpert System from measured fluorescent signals and embedded calculation algorithms. The diagnostic algorithm is based on the results for the optical curves associated with the CT and NG targets as well as the Sample Processing Control (SPC) and Sample Adequacy Control (SAC). A cycle threshold (Ct) is obtained for each curve. The values for Ct are used to determine the presence or absence of the targets being detected (CT, NG, SAC, and SPC). The optical curves for the CT and/or NG target are interpreted as positive if they satisfy fixed criteria for valid threshold fluorescence crossing. The optical curves for the CT and/or NG targets are interpreted as negative if they fail to satisfy fixed criteria for a valid threshold crossing. The following table shows the possible final test results:

There are 3 possible outcomes that require a re-test of the specimen:

INVALID indicates that the SPC and/or the SAC failed. The sample was not properly processed, PCR was inhibited, or the sample was inadequate.

ERROR indicates that the PCC failed and the assay was aborted possibly because the reaction tube was filled improperly, a reagent probe integrity problem was detected, pressure limits were exceeded, or a valve positioning error was detected.

NO RESULT indicates that insufficient data were collected. For example, the operator stopped a test that was in progress.

A re-test is performed on the leftover sample from the CT/NG Transport Reagent tube using a new cartridge.

# M. Performance Characteristics

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility Study:

Reproducibility of the Xpert CT/NG Assay was evaluated at three sites using specimens comprised of CT and NG organisms seeded into pooled, negative male urine (urine matrix) or pooled, negative female vaginal swab samples (swab matrix). The specimens were prepared at concentration levels representing low positive (1X LoD), moderate positive (2-3X LoD), and high positive $\mathrm { \Gamma } > 2 0 \mathrm { X }$ LoD) for each organism. The panel members prepared with high concentrations $\left( > 2 0 \mathrm { x L o D } \right)$ of one organism and low concentrations (1xLoD) of the other organism allowed for the evaluation of potential competitive inhibition of one organism by the other one.

Negative panel members were also included, and were comprised of pooled, negative male urine and pooled, negative vaginal swab samples. A panel of 22 specimens (11 in urine matrix and 11 in swab matrix) was tested on five different days by two different operators four times per day at three sites (22 specimens x 2 operators x 5 days $_ { \textrm { X 4 } }$ replicates per day x 3 sites). Three lots of Xpert CT/NG reagents were included in the study, with two lots being tested at each site. Xpert CT/NG Assays were performed according to the Xpert CT/NG Assay procedure. The rate of agreement with expected results of CT and NG for each panel member was calculated for each site. The results are presented separately for swab samples and urine samples.

Agrmt=Agreement, Conc=concentration, CV=coefficient of variation, $\mathrm { { N / A } = \mathrm { { N o t } } }$ Applicable for negative samples, SD=standard deviation Note: Variability from some factors may be numerically negative, which can occur if the variability due to those factors is very small. When this occurs, the variability as measured with SD and CV is set to 0. $^ 1 \mathrm { A }$ run is defined as the four samples per panel member run by one operator at one site on one day

An in-house precision study was conducted to compare the performance of the GeneXpert Dx and the Infinity-80 Instrument Systems using specimens comprised of CT and NG organisms seeded into negative urine simulated swab matrix. The specimens were prepared at concentration levels representing low positive (0.25-0.5X LoD), moderate positive (2-3X LoD), and high positive $( > 2 0 \mathrm { X }$ LoD) for each organism. Negative panel members were also included and were comprised of negative urine and negative diluent. A panel of 20 specimens (10 in urine matrix and 10 in swab matrix) was tested on 12 different days by two operators. The samples were tested in a different order throughout the study; the specimens were blinded with a Specimen ID, which was used to define the order in which the samples were tested. Each operator conducted four runs of each panel specimen per day on each of the two instrument systems (20 specimens x 4 times/ day x 12 days x 2 operators x 2 instrument systems). One lot of Xpert CT/NG Assay was used for the study. Xpert CT/NG assays were performed according to the Xpert CT/NG Assay procedure. External controls were run on each instrument by each operator on each day that samples were tested. The study challenged the Infinity-80 system by loading the test cartridges continuously by the two operators, which resulted in the worst-case scenario where the maximum number of cartridges was loaded and analyzed simultaneously. Xpert CT/NG assays were performed according to the Xpert CT/NG Assay procedure.

The rate of agreement with expected results of CT and NG for each panel member, in swab matrix, is presented below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Specimen Stability

Specimen stability studies were conducted to evaluate the length of time the claimed specimen types can be stored prior to analysis with the Xpert CT/NG Assay. This study was conducted using cultured and tittered $C .$ . trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae cells spiked into known negative urine and swab specimens and transferred to the appropriate transport reagent tubes. The samples were stored at different temperatures and tested at various time intervals to determine the conditions under which the specimens remain stable. Replicates of three (3) were tested at each time and temperature.

# Urine Specimens

Preserved urine:

Aliquots of pooled negative urine were diluted into Xpert CT/NG Urine Transport Reagent at a ratio of 7:1 (v/v) consistent with Package Insert instructions. $C .$ . trachomatis LGVII (ATCC 434/VR-902B0) and N. gonorrhoeae (ATCC 19424) were spiked into the preserved pooled negative urines. Specimens were stored at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $1 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and tested at several time points out to 45 days. Female urine and male urine were evaluated separately. The data supported stability of preserved female urine specimens up to 45 days when stored at refrigerator temperatures (approximately $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and up to 3 days when left at room temperature. The preserved male urine was stable for 45 days when stored at temperatures from $2 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to $1 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and up to 30 days at temperatures not exceeding $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .

Unpreserved urine:

Spiked unpreserved urines were stored at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and at room temperature and tested at several time points out to 14 days. The data supported stability of unpreserved female and male first catch urine specimens for 1 day at room temperature and for up to 8 days when stored in a refrigerator $( 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ .

# Swab Specimens

C. trachomatis LGVII (ATCC 434/VR-902B0) and $N .$ gonorrhoeae (ATCC 49226) were spiked into preserved pooled negative endocervical swabs and pooled negative vaginal swabs. Specimens were stored at $2 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and tested with Xpert CT/NG Assay at several time points out to 60 days. The study data indicate that endocervical and vaginal swab specimens transferred into the Xpert CT/NG Swab Transport Reagent tube (preserved endocervical/vaginal swab specimen) can be stored up to 60 days at temperatures from $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ prior to testing with the Xpert CT/NG Assay.

# d. Detection limit:

Studies were performed to determine the analytical limit of detection (LoD) of the Xpert CT/NG Assay with purified CT elementary bodies seeded into negative natural human pooled vaginal swab and pooled male urine matrices and NG cells seeded into negative pooled simulated swab and pooled male urine matrices.

# Limit of Detection for CT in Pooled Vaginal Swab Matrix

Elementary bodies from two CT serovars, ATCC vr885 serovar D and ATCC vr879 serovar H, were purified by centrifugation through a $30 \%$ sucrose cushion and titered by enumeration of elementary bodies using transmission electron microscopy. Each serovar was diluted into pooled negative vaginal swab matrix and tested with the Xpert CT/NG Assay. Replicates of 20 were evaluated at eight concentrations for CT serovar D and at seven concentrations for CT serovar H and LoDs were estimated by probit analysis. The claimed LoDs were confirmed by analyzing at least 20 replicate samples with elementary bodies diluted to the estimated LoD concentrations. For this study, the claimed LoD is defined as the lowest concentration at which $9 5 \%$ of at least 20 replicates are positive.

The claimed LoD for purified CT serovar D elementary bodies (EB) in vaginal swab matrix is $8 4 ~ \mathrm { E B / m L }$ . The claimed LoD for purified CT serovar H elementary bodies in vaginal swab matrix is $1 6 1 ~ \mathrm { E B / m L }$ (Table 13). In this study, LoDs for the remaining purified CT serovars (in $\mathrm { E B / m L }$ ) are A (600), B (6), Ba (1900), C (34), E (6), F (202), G (96), I (21), J (150), K (117), LGV I (31), LGV II (20) and LGV III (210) EB/mL.

# e. Inclusivity

Analytical reactivity of additional 13 serotypes and 30 additional NG strains was evaluated in the LoD studies above.

# f. Interference

The analytical performance of the assay was evaluated in the presence of potentially interfering substances that may be found in vaginal/endocervical swab and urine specimens. Potentially interfering exogenous substances were diluted into vaginal/endocervical swab simulated matrix and urine matrix containing two different mixtures of CT and NG cells. The first mixture contained CT serovar D and NG strain ATCC 49226, each at the 5x LoD concentration. The second mixture contained CT serovar H and NG strain ATCC 19424, each at the 5x LoD concentration.

# h. Carryover/Cross-contamination

A study was conducted to demonstrate that single-use, self-contained GeneXpert cartridges prevent carry-over contamination in negative samples run following very high positive samples in the same GeneXpert module. The study consisted of a negative sample processed in the same GeneXpert module immediately following a sample with high CT spike $( 1 . 9 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 4 } \mathrm { E B / m L ) }$ and a high NG spike $( 5 . 2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ CFU/mL). Two sample types were used for this testing: a) known pooled negative urine samples; and b) known pooled negative swab samples. Each sample type was tested in each of four GeneXpert modules for a total of 44 runs for both swab and urine samples resulting in 20 positives and 24 negatives. All 40 positive samples were correctly reported as CT DETECTED; NG DETECTED. All 48 negative samples were correctly reported as CT NOT DETECTED; NG NOT DETECTED. There was no cross-contamination observed during this study.

# i. Assay cut-off:

The valid cycle threshold $\mathrm { ( C t ) }$ range for the C. trachomatis CT1 analyte, the $N .$ gonorrhoeae analyte 1 (NG2), the N. gonorrhoeae analyte 2 (NG4), and the Sample Adequacy Control (SAC) is 12 to 45. The valid Ct range for the Sample Processing Control (SPC) is 25 to 45. For a valid “NG DETECTED” result, Cts for both $N .$ .

gonorrhoeae analytes (NG2 and NG4) must be reported in the valid detectable range. These cutoffs maximize sensitivity without specificity falling below $9 8 \%$ . The cutoff of 45 Cts for each target was validated in the clinical study.

# 2. Comparison studies

# a. Comparison with predicate device:

The comparison studies were conducted in a clinical study with prospectively collected samples (see the Clinical studies section below).The performance of the Xpert CT/NG assay with patient specimens was evaluated by comparison to a Patient Infected Status (PIS) algorithm based on a combination of results from two sample types (matrices) each tested by two predicate devices. A patient was considered infected (I), for CT or for NG, if at least one positive result for the respective organism was obtained from each reference assay. Any other combination of results was categorized as not infected (NI). In this study, reference testing was performed using endocervical swab specimens and urine specimens from females, and urethral swabs and urine specimens from male patients. Result obtained by Xpert CT/NG assay for each claimed specimen type (female endocervical swabs and self-collected vaginal swabs, female urine specimens and male urine specimens) was evaluated against the Patient Infected Status (PIS). One exception was made for females with positive results on both reference urine specimens and negative results on both reference swab specimens; these patients were categorized as infected (I) for urine and not infected (NI) for the swab specimens.

The table below shows the results from symptomatic and asymptomatic females designated as infected or not infected with CT based on the PIS algorithm.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Prospective Clinical Studies:

The performance of the Xpert CT/NG assay was evaluated in a multi-site investigational study comparing the Xpert CT/NG Assay on the GeneXpert instrument systems to a patient infected status algorithm (PIS) based on results from the BD ProbeTec™ ET Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae Amplified DNA Assays, and the Gen-Probe $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ APTIMA Combo $2 \textcircled{ \mathbb { R } }$ Assay. The study included prospectively collected male urine, male urethral swab, female urine, endocervical swab, and patient-collected vaginal swab (collected in a clinical setting) specimens. Specimens included in the study were collected at 36 geographically diverse sites (including four sites located in the United Kingdom) from consenting asymptomatic and symptomatic, sexually active males and females seen at locations including, but not limited to: OB/GYN, sexually transmitted disease (STD), teen, public health, and family planning clinics. All reference testing was conducted at one of two central testing laboratories. Collection-only sites also shipped specimens to laboratories for Xpert testing. Collection and testing sites conducted Xpert testing on site. There were 36 collection sites and 15 testing sites. Nine testing sites used the GeneXpert Dx system, five sites used the GeneXpert 16 system and one site used the Infinity 48 and the Infinity 80 systems. Site personnel performing the Xpert CT/NG Assay testing were trained prior to performing any study procedures. The training included the minimum requirements to be eligible for CLIA moderate complexity. Three external controls (commercially available), one positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, one positive for Chlamydia trachomatis and one negative (human cell line) control, were run each day of testing to monitor the performance of the Xpert CT/NG Assay. A total of 1525 controls were run during the study (502 negative, 525 CT positive, 498 NG negative).

The study subjects ranged from 17 to 61 years of age. Each female study participant provided three endocervical swabs, one self-collected vaginal swab (collected in a clinical setting), and one urine specimen. Each male study participant provided one urine specimen and two urethral swabs.

Performance of the Xpert CT/NG Assay was calculated relative to the PIS for each of the three female sample types (endocervical swabs, patient-collected vaginal swabs and urine), and male urine.

# Performance with Chlamydia trachomatis

Among the 3781 females, a total of 212 female subjects were infected with CT. Symptoms were reported in $4 1 . 0 \%$ (87/212) of infected and $3 4 . 1 \%$ (1221/3579) noninfected female subjects. Among the 3444 males, 196 male subjects were infected with CT. The calculated sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values (based on the prevalence of infection observed during the study) of the Xpert CT/NG Assay for CT, compared against the PIS algorithm, are presented by gender, sample type, and symptom status in the following table.

The prevalence of infection with CT and/or NG in patient populations depends on risk factors such as age, gender, the presence or absence of symptoms, the type of clinic, and the sensitivity of the test used to detect infections. During the clinical evaluation of the Xpert CT/NG Assay, the observed CT prevalence rates in females and males were $5 . 4 \%$ and $5 . 7 \%$ , respectively. The observed NG prevalence rates in females and males were $1 . 4 \%$ and $3 . 5 \%$ , respectively.

# Positive and Negative Predictive Values

Hypothetical estimated positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) for different prevalence rates using the Xpert CT/NG Assay are shown in tables below. These calculations are based on a hypothetical prevalence and the overall sensitivity and specificity (compared to the patient infected status) of the Xpert CT/NG Assay observed during the multi-center clinical study.

In patient-collected vaginal swab specimens, the overall sensitivity and specificity for CT were 99.5 and $9 9 . 1 \%$ , respectively. The overall sensitivity and specificity for NG were $100 \%$ and $9 9 . 9 \%$ , respectively.

# N. Instrument Name:

GeneXpert Instrument Systems

GeneXpert Dx System · GeneXpert Infinity-48 System

GeneXpert Infinity-80 System

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

Automated

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes ___x___ or No

3. Specimen Identification:

Specimen identification is performed with a barcode scanner or by manually entering the information into GeneXpert system software.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Specimen handling (once loaded test cartridge) is performed in either an Automation Mode or in a Manual Mode. In the Automation Mode, test cartridges are placed on a conveyor belt, picked up by a gantry, and introduced into an available module for processing.

# 5. Calibration:

Calibration is performed by Cepheid prior to installation. Cepheid recommends the GeneXpert Infinity-80 System be recalibrated after 1 year of use or at 2000 tests per instrument module, whichever comes first. The user does not calibrate or perform any serviceable functions on the instruments.

# 6. Quality Control:

The integrity of the system is verified and controlled by specific hardware/software checks during the cartridge load process, and during the test itself. During each test, the system uses internal controls included in each cartridge to monitor the sample processing, check for PCR inhibition and to ensure that the sample used is adequate. In addition to the internal controls, the GeneXpert instrument performs a probe check during the first stage of the test. A probe check verifies the presence and the integrity of the labeled probes. A probe-check status of Pass indicates that the probe check results meet the programmed acceptance criteria. The instrument also contains an internal temperature control which ensures that the GeneXpert is operating within validated heating and cooling specifications. The system is capable of generating Control Trend reports to check for reagent degradation over time.
