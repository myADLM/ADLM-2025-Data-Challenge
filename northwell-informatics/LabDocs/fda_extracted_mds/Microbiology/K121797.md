# INTENDED USE:

The BD Veritor ™M System for Rapid Detection of Flu $A + B$ is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the direct and qualitative detection of influenza A and B viral nucleoprotein antigens from nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate and swab samples in transport media from symptomatic patients. The BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu $A + B$ EPY is a differentiated test, such that influenza A viral antigens can be distinguished from influenza B viral antigens from a single processed sample using a single device. The test is to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza A and B viral infections. A negative test is presumptive and it is recommended that these results be confirmed by viral culture or an FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay. Negative test results do not preclude influenza viral infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. The test is not intended to detect influenza C antigens.

Performance characteristics for influenza A and B nasopharyngeal (NP) wash/aspirates were established during January through March of 2011 when influenza viruses A/2009 . H1N1, AH3N2, B/Victoria lineage, and B/Yamagata lineage were the predominant influenza viruses in circulation according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the CDC entitled "Update: Influenza Activity—United States, 2010-2011 Season, and Composition of the 2011-2012 Influenza Vaccine." Performance characteristics may vary against other emerging influenza viruses.

Performance characteristics for influenza A and B NP swabs in transport media were established during February through April of 2012 when influenza viruses A/2009 H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria lineage, and B/Yamagata lineage were the predominant influenza viruses in circulation according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the CDC

entitled "Update: Influenza Activity—United States, 2011-2012 Season, and Composition of the 2012-2013 Influenza Vaccine." Performance characteristics may vary against other emerging influenza viruses.

If infection with a novel influenza virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to the state or local health department for testing. Virus culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

The BD Flu $A + B$ test is a chromatographic assay to qualitatively detect influenza A and B viral antigens in samples processed from respiratory specimens. The processed specimen is added to the test device where influenza A or influenza B viral antigens bind to antiinfluenza antibodies conjugated to detector particles on the $A + B$ test strip. The antigenconjugate complex migrates across the test strip to the reaction area and is captured by an antibody line on the membrane. Results are interpreted by the BD Veritor ™ System Reader, a portable electronic device which uses a reflectance-based measurement method to evaluate the line signal intensities on the assay test strip, and applies specific algorithms to determine the presence or absence of any target analyte(s). A liquid crystal display (LCD) on the instrument communicates the results to the operator.

# DEVICE COMPARISON:

# The BD Veritor ™M System for Rapid Detection of Flu $A + B$ was compared to the Quidel QuickVue Influenza $A + B$ test (k053146 and k092698).

# Clinical Performance Data for NP Swabs in Transport Media 2011-2012

# EXPECTED VALUES

The rate of positivity observed in respiratory testing will vary depending on the method of specimen collection, handling/transport system employed, detection method utilized, the time of year, age of the patient, geographic location and most importantly, local disease prevalence. The overall prevalence observed with an FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay in the U.S. during the 2011-2012 clinical study was $3 1 . 7 \%$ for influenza A and $4 . 5 \%$ for influenza B. At the clinical sites located in Japan, the prevalence observed with the same FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay was $0 \%$ for influenza A and $89 \%$ for influenza B.

BD Veritor™" System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B Clinical Laboratory Product

510(k) Number: k121797

# Device Name: BD Veritor ™ System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B

# Indications for Use:

The BD Veritor.™ System for Rapid Detection of Flu $A + B$ is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the direct and qualitative detection of influenza A and B viral nucleoprotein antigens from nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate and swab samples in transport media from symptomatic patients. The BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu $A + B$ is a differentiated test, such that influenza A viral antigens can be distinguished fro influenza Bviral antigens from a single procesed sample using a single device The test is to beused as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza A and Bviral infections.A negative test is presumptive and it is recommended that these results be confirmed by viral culture or an FDA-cleared influenza A and B mollassyegaiv sult o recnfzaien houl ot s sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. The test is not intended to detect influenza C antigens.

Performance characteristics for influenza A and B nasopharyngeal (NP) wash/aspirates were established during January through March of 2011 when influenza viruses A/2009 H1N1, AH3N2, BVictoria lineage, and BYamagatalneage were the predominant influenz viruses  circulation according o theMorbidiy and Mortality Weekly Report from the CDC entitled "Update: Influenza Activity—United States, 2010-2011 Season, and Composition of the 2011-2012 Influenza Vaccine." Performance characteristics may vary against other emerging influenza viruses.

Performance characteristics for influenza A and B NP swabs in transport media were established during February through April of 2012 when influenza viruses A/2009 H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria lineage, and BYamagata lneage were the predominant influenza viruses in circulation according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the CDC entitled "Update: Influenza Activity—United States, 2011-2012 Season, and Composition of the 2012-2013 Influenza Vaccine." Performance characteristics may vary against other emerging influenza viruses.

Iin wi novellezavis  usec as crret cnl neilgial c criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be colected with appropriate infection cnol precautions or novel virulent influenzaviruses and sent to the stater ocalhealhdepartment fo testing. Virus culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.
