# Product Description

VRESelect TM is a selective medium for the detection of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). The selectivity of this medium is based on the presence of an antifungal/antibiotic mixture that inhibits the growth of most yeast, Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria, with the exception of vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE).

Detection is based on the cleavage of chromogenic substrates by specific enzymes of Enterococcus faecium which produces pink colonies and Enterococus faecalis which produces blue colonies.

Enterococcus gallinarum and Enterococcus casseliflavus are intrinsically resistant to vancomycin and may grow on the VRESelectTM medium as colorless or white colonies because they do not metabolize the chromogenic substrates. Vancomycin susceptible enterococci are inhibited.

After 24 to 28 hours incubation pink colonies can be reported as VREfm. Blue colonies should be confirmed by a catalase test and susceptibility (refer to limitation 9 in package insert).

# Intended Use

VRESelect TM is a selective and differential chromogenic medium, containing $8 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ of vancomycin, for the qualitative detection of gastrointestinal colonization of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VREfs) and to aid in the prevention and control of VRE in healthcare settings. The test is performed on rectal swabs or fecal specimens from patients to be screened for VRE colonization. VRESelect TM is not intended to diagnose VRE infection nor to guide or monitor treatment of infection. Results can be interpreted after 24 to 28 hours incubation. Subculture to non-selective media (e.g., trypticase soy agar with $5 \%$ sheep blood) is needed for susceptibility testing and epidemiological typing.

# Performance Data

Interfering Substances

The following potential interfering substances were tested to confirm that they did not interfere with the performance of the VRESelect TM media:

Dulcolax®, Adult Glycerin Suppositories, Vaseline®, Preparation $\mathrm { H } ^ { \circledast }$ , Original   
Boudreaux's Butt Paste®, Tuck's Medicated Cooling Pads®, Pepto-Bismol®, Miconazole cream, Nonoxynol-9 (spermicide), ${ \displaystyle { \cal K } { \bf Y } ^ { \otimes } }$ Jelly, and Pepcid AC Max strength®.   
Blood and Mucins   
Three commonly used transport media  Amies without charcoal, Cary Blair. and LQ Stuart

The interfering substances tested caused no significant differences between the number of colonies observed on the Control plates and the number of colonies observed on the VRESelect plates. The only exceptions were Tuck's Medicated Cooling Pads® (coloration delayed after

24 hours with VREfm (ATCC 700221)) and Miconazole cream. The blood and mucins caused a delayed growth of one VREfs strain (ATCC 51299).

Cross Reactivity Testing (Analytical Specificity)

A cross-reactivity study was performed to determine if strains other than vancomycin-resistant enterococci could grow on VRESelect TM. One hundred thirty one (131) microorganisms representing Gram-negative rods, Gram-positive cocci, and yeasts were evaluated with the VRESelect TM. No cross-reactivity was observed with any strain tested. No variation was seen between 24 and 28 hour incubation time.

# Limit of Detection Study

The minimum concentration of VRE reliably detected by VRESelect $\mathbf { T M }$ is $1 0 ^ { 3 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$

To determine the percent recovery for the VRESelect TM media a panel of eighteen vancomycinresistant enterococci  8 VREfm and 10 VREfs - were tested at varying dilutions. For each strain to be tested a $0 . 5 \mathrm { M c F }$ arland suspension of the strain was prepared, A series of 10-fold. serial dilutions in saline were carried out and inoculated onto three lots of VRESelect TM plates and one lot of Blood Agar plates. The plates were incubated at $3 5 . 3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ambient air and read at 24 and 28 hours. The color and number of colonies were recorded. The Blood Agar plates were used to confirm the inoculum concentration at each dilution. Data confirmed that the minimum concentration of VRE reliably detected by VRESelect $\mathbf { T M }$ is $1 0 ^ { 3 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ .

# Reproducibility

In order to confirm the reproducibility of the VRESelectTM medium a blinded panel of 6 ATCC reference strains (2 VREfs, 3 VREfm, and 1 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus) were tested at three sites. At each site three technicians tested the panel on three lots of VRESelect TM each day for three days. The strains produced the expected results with VRESelect TM $100 \%$ of the time at 24 and 28 hours.

# Challenge Panel

VRESelect TM was evaluated with fifty-six (56) well-characterized strains including vancomycin-resistant and vancomycin-susceptible $E$ faecalis and $E$ faecium, as well as microorganisms commonly isolated from stool. All strains showed expected results.

# Method Comparison

946 stool samples were tested on VRESelect TM media (pink or blue colonies between 24 and 28 hours incubation) and BEAV (colonies with dark halos between 24 and 48 hours incubation) plus confirmatory testing (Gram stain, catalase, PYR, Vitek 2 identification and vancomycin (MIC ETest) showed the following results.

\* Thirty-three (33) of the 36 specimens that were BEAV plus Confirmation negative and that grew pink and/or blue colonies on VRESelect TM media, after subculture to blood agar plates (BAPs), were confirmed to be vancomycin resistant $E .$ faecium and/or $E .$ faecalis by biochemical identification and vancomycin E-Test. Three (3) specimens that were BEAV plus Confirmation negative and that grew pink and/or blue colonies on VRESelect TM media, after subculture to blood agar plates (BAPs), were not confirmed biochemical identification and vancomycin E-Test to be E. faecium and/or $E .$ faecalis and represent false positive results.

# Indications for Use

510(k) Number (f known):129187 Device Name: VRESelect M

Indications for Use:

VRESelect TM is a selective and differential chromogenic medium, containing $8 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ of vancomycin, for the qualitative detection of gastrointestinal colonization of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VREfs) and to aid in the prevention and control of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) in healthcare settings. The test is performed on rectal swabs or fecal specimens from patients to be screened for VRE colonization. VRESelect TM is not intended to diagnose VRE infection nor to guide or monitor treatment of infection. Results can be interpreted after 24 to 28 hours incubation. Subculture to non-selective media (e.g., trypticase soy agar with $5 \%$ sheep blood) is needed for susceptibility testing and epidemiological typing.
