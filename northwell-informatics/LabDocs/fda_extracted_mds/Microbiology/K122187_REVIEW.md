The test is performed on rectal swab, or fecal specimens from patients to be screened for VRE colonization. VRESelect™ is not intended to diagnose VRE infection nor to guide or monitor treatment of infection. Results can be interpreted after 24 to 28 hours incubation. Subculture to non-selective media (e.g., trypticase soy agar with $5 \%$ sheep blood) is needed for further identification, susceptibility testing and epidemiological typing.

3. Special conditions for use statement:

Prescription use.

The performance of VRESelect™ has not been evaluated with vancomycin resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus.

After 24 to 28 hours incubation pink colonies can be reported as vancomycinresistant Enterococcus faecium. Blue colonies should be confirmed by a direct catalase test and, if negative, by vancomycin susceptibility testing.

4. Special instrument requirements: Not Applicable.

# I. Device Description:

VRESelect™ is a selective medium for the detection of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). The selectivity of this medium is based on the presence of an antifungal/antibiotic mixture that inhibits the growth of most yeast, Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria, with the exception of VRE. Vancomycin-resistant $E$ . faecium will appear as pink colonies on the agar medium. Blue colonies on the agar medium, suggestive of vancomycin-resistant $E .$ . faecalis should be confirmed by catalase and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document referenced (if applicable):

Not Applicable.

# L. Test Principle:

VRESelect ™ is a selective medium for the detection of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). The selectivity of this medium is based on the presence of an antifungal/antibiotic mixture that inhibits the growth of most yeasts, Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria, with the exception of VRE.

Detection is based on the cleavage of chromogenic substrates by specific enzymes of Enterococcus faecium which produces pink colonies and Enterococcus faecalis which produces blue colonies.

Enterococcus gallinarum and Enterococcus casseliflavus are intrinsically resistant to vancomycin and may grow on the VRESelect™ medium as colorless or white colonies because they do not metabolize the chromogenic substrates. Vancomycinsusceptible enterococci are inhibited.

After 24 to 28 hours incubation pink colonies can be reported as vancomycin-resistant $E .$ . faecium and blue colonies should be confirmed by a catalase test and susceptibility testing.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility was demonstrated at three sites using a blinded panel of six ATCC reference strains including two vancomycin-resistant $E$ . faecalis strains, three vancomycin-resistant $E .$ . faecium strains and one strain of vancomycin-susceptible $E .$ . faecalis. At each site, three technicians tested the panel on three lots of the VRESelect™ each day, for three days. The strains produced the expected results with the VRESelect™ $100 \%$ of the time both at 24 and 28 hours.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not Applicable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The following recommended quality control (QC) organisms were used: $E$ . faecium (vanA) ATCC 700221 and E. faecalis (vanB) ATCC 51299 as positive controls, and $E .$ . faecalis ATCC 29212 as negative control. Quality control was performed on each day of testing by preparing a 0.5 McFarland suspension of each QC strain then diluting is 1:10 and transferring $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of this suspension to the VRESelect™ agar surface streaking for isolation. Quality control data was compiled across all three sites and overall QC results were acceptable.

d. Detection limit:

The minimum concentration of VRE reliably detected by VRESelect ™ is $1 0 ^ { 3 }$ CFU/mL. Details of the recovery study are found in Section f below.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Cross-reactivity Study

A Cross-reactivity study was performed using at total of 119 strains of Gram negative rods, Gram positive cocci and yeast. No cross-reactivity was observed with any of the organisms tested and no variation was seen between the 24 and 28 hour incubation time.

# Interference Study

The following substances were evaluated at physiologically or biologically relevant concentrations for potential interference with the performance of the VRESelect™ medium:

Dulcolax, Adult Glycerin Suppositories, Vaseline, Preparation H, Original Boudreaux’s Butt Paste, Tuck’s Medicated Cooling Pads, Pepto-Bismol, Miconazole cream, Nonoxynol-9 (spermicide), KY Jelly, and Pepcid AC Max strength. · Blood and Mucins Three commonly used transport media – Amies without charcoal, Cary Blair and LQ Stuart

The interfering substances tested caused no significant differences between the number of colonies observed on the control plates and the number of colonies observed on the VRESelect™ plates. The only exceptions were Tuck’s Medicated Cooling Pads and Miconazole cream. Regarding Tuck’s Medicated Pads, no pink coloration was observed after 24 hours on the VRESelect™ plates that had been inoculated with vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (ATCC 700221). Regarding Miconazole cream, an inhibitory effect on the growth of Enterococcus colonies on the VRESelect™ plates was observed. Blood and mucin $3 \%$ to $5 \%$ ) caused delayed colonial growth of one strain of vancomycin-resistant $E$ . faecalis (ATCC 51299) tested. The growth of the same strain of vancomycin-resistant $E .$ . faecalis was inhibited at blood and mucin concentrations of $30 \%$ to $50 \%$ .

# Mixed Infection Study

A mixed infection study was conducted to demonstrate that high levels $\mathrm { 1 X 1 0 ^ { 7 } C F U / m L }$ or higher) of $E$ . gallinarum and/or $E$ . casseliflavus will not suppress the growth of vancomycin-resistant $E .$ . faecium or $E .$ . faecalis. The results of the study revealed $E .$ . faecium or $E .$ . faecalis are still detected on the VRESelect ™ medium in the presence of high levels of $E$ . casseliflavus and E. gallinarum.

# f. Analytical Sensitivity

Recovery Study

The minimum concentration of VRE reliably detected by VRESelect ™ is $1 0 ^ { 3 }$ CFU/mL.

To determine the percent recovery for the VRESelect ™ media a panel of eighteen (18) vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE)– (8) strains of vancomycin-resistant $E .$ . faecium and (10) strains of vancomycin-resistant $E$ . faecalis – were tested at varying dilutions. A $0 . 5 \mathrm { M c F }$ arland suspension of each strain was prepared. A series of 10-fold serial dilutions in saline were carried out and inoculated onto three lots of VRESelect ™ plates and one lot of Blood Agar plates. The plates were incubated at $3 5 { - } 3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ambient air and read at 24 and 28 hours. The color and number of colonies were recorded. The Blood Agar plates were used to confirm the inoculum concentration at each dilution. Data confirm that the minimum concentration of VRE reliably detected by VRESelect ™ is $1 0 ^ { 3 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ .

g. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The performance of the VRESelect™ agar medium was evaluated at three laboratory sites. A total of 946 fecal samples were evaluated. Fecal samples were inoculated using the indirect inoculation method where approximately $0 . 5 \ \mathrm { g }$ of stool is placed in $1 \mathrm { m L }$ of saline, then mixed by vortexing. Using a swab or a disposable loop, approximately $1 0 { - } 5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ is transferred onto the VRESelect™ agar medium and the Bile Esculin Azide Agar with $6 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m l }$ of

Vancomycin (BEAV). The BEAV plates were observed for growth at 24 and 48 hours. The VRESelect™ plates were observed at 24 and 28 hours. Colonies with blue or pink pigment (VRESelect™) or brown to black pigment diffusing into the medium (BEAV), were identified by a combination of conventional reference methods to include Gram stain, catalase, PYR, VITEK 2 identification, and vancomycin MIC E-Test.

Percent agreement of the VRESelect™ compared to BEAV and conventional methods is presented in Table 1. Specimens that were positive on the VRESelect (i.e. grew pink or blue colonies between 24 and 28 hours incubation) were compared to specimens that were confirmed positive based on growth and pigment on BEAV combined with Gram stain, catalase test, PYR test, biochemical identification, and E-test MIC)
