D. 510(k) Summary:

VITEK $\mathfrak { s } _ { 2 }$ Streptococcus Ceftriaxone is designed for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Streptococcus species. VITEK® 2 Streptococcus Ceftriaxone is a quantitative test intended for use with the VITEK® 2 and $\mathsf { v } \mathsf { I T E K } ^ { \otimes } \mathsf { 2 }$ Compact Systems as a laboratory aid in the determination of in vitro susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.

Ceftriaxone has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganism, according to the FDA label for this antimicrobial.

Active In Vitro and in Clinical Infections against:

Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Streptoccocus agalactiae viridans group streptococci

The VITEK® 2 Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) is intended to be used with the VITEK $\boldsymbol { \mathfrak { B } } _ { 2 }$ and VITEK® 2 Compact Systems for the automated quantitative or qualitative susceptibility testing of

isolated colonies for the most clinicaly significant aerobic gram-negative bacili, Staphylococcus spp.   
Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus spp. and clinically significant yeast.

The antimicrobial presented in VITEK® 2 AST cards is in concentrations equivalent by efficacy to standard method concentrations in mcg/mL. The VITEK® 2 AST cards are essentially miniaturized versions of the doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) microdilution methodology.

The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with $0 . 4 5 \%$ to $0 . 5 0 \%$ saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The ViTEK® 2 automatically fils, seals and places the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK® 2 Compact has a manual filing, sealing and loading operation. The VITEK® 2 Systems monitor the growth of each wellin the card over a defied perid of tme up to 36 hours or yeast). At the completion of he incubation cycle, a reprt is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.

VITEK® 2 Streptococcus Ceftriaxone demonstrated substantially equivalent performance when compared with the CLSI broth microdilution reference method, as defined in the FDA Class II Special Controls Guidance Document:Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA. Issued August 28, 2009.

The Premarket Notification (510[k]) presents data in support of VITEK $\mathfrak { P } _ { 2 }$ Streptococcus Ceftriaxone. An external evaluation was conducted with fresh and stock clinical isolates, as wel as a set of challenge strains. The external evaluations were designed to confirm the acceptability of VITEK® 2 Streptococcus Ceftriaxone by comparing its performance with the CLSl broth microdilution reference method. The data is representative of performance on both theVITEK $\$ 2$ and VITEK® 2 Compact instrument platforms. VITEK® 2 Streptococcus Ceftriaxone demonstrated acceptable performance of $9 8 . 9 \%$ overall essential agreement and $9 7 . 2 \%$ overall category agreement with the reference method. Reproducibility and Quality Control demonstrated acceptable results using both the VITE ${ \sf K } ^ { \otimes } 2$ and VITEK® 2 Compact instrument systems.

Dear Ms. Dang:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 796- 5450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance, please contact CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometric's (OSB's) Division of Postmarket Surveillance at (301) 796-5760. For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.
