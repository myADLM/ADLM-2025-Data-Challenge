# Intended Use:

Intended use(s):

The Verigene® Gram-Positive Blood Culture Nucleic Acid Test (BC-GP) performed using the sample-to-result Verigene System is a qualitative, multiplexed in vitro diagnostic test for the simultaneous detection and identification of potentially pathogenic gram-positive bacteria which may cause bloodstream infection (BSI). BC-GP is performed directly on blood culture bottles identified as positive by a continuousmonitoring blood culture system and which contain gram-positive bacteria. BC-GP detects and identifies the following bacterial genera and species: Staphylococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosus group, and Listeria spp.

In addition, BC-GP detects the mecA resistance marker, inferring mecA-mediated methicillin resistance, and the vanA and vanB resistance markers, inferring vanA/vanBmediated vancomycin resistance. In mixed growth, BC-GP does not specifically attribute van-mediated vancomycin resistance to either $E$ faecalis or E. faecium, or mecAmediated methicillin resistance to either S. aureus or S. epidermidis.

BC-GP is indicated for use in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings to aid in the diagnosis of bacterial bloodstream infections; however, is not to be used to monitor these infections. Sub-culturing of positive blood cultures is necessary to recover organisms for susceptibility testing, identification of organisms not detected by BC-GP, differentiation of mixed growth, association of antimicrobial resistance marker genes to a specific organism, or for epidemiological typing.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): Prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements: Performed using the sample-to-result Verigene System

# Device Description:

The Verigene® Gra-Psiiv Bloo Cultue Nucleic cid Test (BC-GP) i a oearassay which relies on detection of specific nucleic acid targets in a microarray format. For each of the bacterial nucleic acid sequences detected by the BC-GP test, Capture and Mediator oligonucleotides are utilized for gold nanoparticle probe-based endpoint detection. The Capture oligonucleotides bind to a specific portion of the nucleic acid target and are themselves bound onto a substrate in the microarray. The Mediator oligonucleotides bind to a different portion of the same nucleic acid target and allow binding of a gold nanoparticle probe to a portion complementary to a gold nanoparticle probe. Specific silver enhancement of the bound gold nanoparticle probes at the capture sites results in gold-silver aggregates that scatter light with high efficiency.

The BC-GP test is performed on the Verigene System, a "sample-to-result", fully automated, bench-top molecular diagnostics workstation. The Verigene System consists of two components: the Verigene Reader and the Verigene Processor $S P$ The BC-GP test utilizes single-use disposable test consumables and a self-contained Verigene Test Cartridge for each sample tested. For the BC-GP test, the Verigene System allows automated nucleic acid extraction from grampositive bacteria-containing blood culture specimens and target detection of bacteria-specific DNA.

The Reader is the Verigene System's user interface, which serves as the central control unit for all aspects of test processing and results generation. The Reader's graphical user interface guides the user through test processing and test results using a barcode scanner. The user inserts the Test Cartridge into the Verigene Processor $S P$ which executes the test procedure, automating the steps of (1) Sample Preparation - Cell lysis and magnetic bead-based bacterial DNA isolation from blood culture samples and (2) Hybridization  Detection and identification of bacterialspecific DNA in a microarray format by using gold nanoparticle probe-based technology.

After test processing is complete, to obtain the test results the user removes the Test Cartridge from the Processor $S P$ , removes the reagent pack from the substrate holder, and inserts the substrate holder into the Reader for analysis. Light scatter from the capture spots is imaged by the Reader and intensities from the microarray spots are used to make decisions regarding the presence (Detected) or absence (Not Detected) of a bacterial nucleic acid sequence/analyte.

# Test Principle:

The Verigene Gram-Positive Blood Culture Nucleic Acid Test (BC-GP) is a qualitative, multiplexed molecular assay which relies on detection of specific nucleic acid targets in a microarray format. Bacterial DNA from the organisms present in a positive blood culture media specimen is extracted, fragmented and denatured. This fragmented, single-stranded bacterial DNA hybridizes to complementary sequence-specific DNA oligonucleotides, known as capture oligonucleotides, arrayed on the surface of a substrate. A second oligonucleotide with two sequence domains, called a mediator oligonucleotide, then hybridizes to the captured bacterial DNA. In addition to a sequence complementary to the bacterial DNA target, the mediator oligonucleotide contains a sequence domain complementary to a common oligonucleotide probe that is bound to gold nanoparticles. After washing away any DNA not affixed to the captures, the common probe is exposed to the microarray where it hybridizes to any captured mediator/target complexes. Presence of the silver-enhanced gold nanoparticle probes at a particular location on the substrate is determined optically with the Verigene Reader. The relative density of probes at each set o captures on the substrate is then translated into a signal intensity which is used to assess the presence or absence of captured DNA from a target organism.

# Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Analytical studies performed to support the expanded intended use/indications of the test are described in part $g$ below. The full analytical and clinical performance data establishing the performance characteristics of the BC-GP test was completed in support of K113450 and remain unchanged for the device as modified under this 510(k).

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Refer to K113450   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Refer to K113450   
d. Detection limit: Refer to K113450   
e. Analytical specificity: Refer to K113450   
f. Assay cut-off: Refer to K113450

g. Analytical Testing of Additional Culture Bottles

The BC-GP analytical and clinical validations used to support K113450 were performed primarily with two types of aerobic blood culture bottles, BACTEC™M Plus Aerobic/F (Becton-Dickinson) and BacT/ALERT FA FAN® (bioMérieux). The suitability of five additional blood culture bottles or use with BC-GP, including BACTEC™ Standard/10 Aerobic/F, BACTEC™M Peds PlusTM/F, BacT/ALERT SA Standard Aerobic, BacT/ALERT PF Pediatric FAN, and BACTEC™M Plus Anaerobic/F bottles was also demonstrated in an analytical interference study described in K113450.

To support the expanded intended use of the BC-GP test, a new study was performed to evaluate additional culture bottles and a third automated culture system. Six bottles types were tested, including the BACTEC Standard Anaerobic/F, BACTEC Lytic/10 Anaerobic/F, BacT/ALERT SN Anaerobic, BacT/ALERT FN FAN Anaerobic, as well as the VersaTREK REDOX 1 EZ Draw Aerobic® and VersaTREK REDOX 2 EZ Draw Anaerobic® bottles used on the VersaTREK® system.

To evaluate performance of these six additional bottles types, representative strains of S. aureus (methicillin resistant), S. epidermidis (methicillin-resistant), E. faecium (vancomycin-resistant), S. pneumoniae, and L. monocytogenes were inoculated into seven replicates of each blood culture bottle type, grown until "bottle positivity" and tested with BC-GP. All of the six bottle types demonstrated acceptable performance, with the expected targets detected for all tests performed with two exceptions: a) two of twenty-one replicates of MRSE in BACTEC Lytic/10 Anaerobic/F bottles were positive for Staphylococcus spp. but negative for S. epidermidis and mecA, and b) one replicate of Listeria monocytogenes in a VersaTREK REDOX 2 EZ DRAW/Anaerobic (Trek N) bottle detected Staphylococcus spp. in addition to the Listeria spp. target. Product labeling includes information regarding detection of MRSE in BACTEC Lytic/10 Anaerobic/F bottles and the potential cross-reactivity of Listeria species with BC-GP Staphylococcus species probes.

Therefore, in total analytical testing demonstrated acceptable performance of thirteen blood culture bottle typeswith the BC-GP test.
