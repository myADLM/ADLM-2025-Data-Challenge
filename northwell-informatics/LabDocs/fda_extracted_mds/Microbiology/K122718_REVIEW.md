# I. Device Description:

The BD Veritor™ System for rapid detection of Group A Strep is a qualitative, lateral flow immunoassay for the detection of Strep A carbohydrate antigen in a throat swab. In this test, antibody specific to Strep A carbohydrate antigen is coated on the test line region of the. Assay device. During testing, the processed throat swab specimen reacts with an antibody to Strep A that is conjugated onto detector particles. The mixture migrates up the membrane to react with the antibody to Strep A on the membrane and is captured by the line of antibody on the membrane. A positive result for Strep A is determined by the BD Veritor ™ System Reader when antigen-conjugate is deposited at the Test "T" position and the Control "C" position on the BD Veritor™ System Strep A assay device.

The following components are included in the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Group A Strep test kit.

# L. Test Principle:

The BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Group A Strep is a chromatographic assay to qualitatively detect the presence of the Group A Strep antigen. For each test, three drops of GAS Reagent 1 are added to a prefilled tube of GAS Reagent 2, the swab added and incubated for two minutes. A filter tip is attached to the tube and three drops of solution are dispensed into the sample well of a BD Group A Strep test device. After five minutes at room temperature the device is inserted into the BD Veritor™ System Reader for interpretation.

The extracted specimens are added to the test device where Group A Strep carbohydrate antigens bind to antibodies conjugated to detector particles on the test strip. The antigenconjugate complex migrates across the test strip to the reaction area and is captured by an antibody line on the membrane. The assay utilizes a proprietary enhanced colloidal-gold particle captured at the test line as the means for identifying the presence of the analyte. The assay test strips are designed with spatially-distinct zones including positive and negative control line positions, a test line position (labeled ‘T’ on the device) for the analyte, and a background zone. The onboard positive control ensures the sample has flowed correctly and is indicated on the test device as $^ { \circ } C '$ . The onboard negative control zone addresses non-specific signal generation and is not labeled on the test device. The remaining distinct zone on the test device is closest to the sample well and the location is not labeled. This zone is used to measure the assay background. The test kit also contains external swab controls to ensure the assay has been performed correctly and that the entire system is performing as intended.

The BD Veritor™ System Reader is a portable electronic device used to interpret BD Veritor lateral flow test devices. It is a battery powered electronic reader which uses a reflectancebased measurement method to evaluate the line signal intensities on the assay test strip, and applies specific algorithms to determine the presence or absence of any target analyte(s). The reader determines the line intensity at each of the spatially-defined test and control line positions, interprets the results using the scoring algorithm, and reports a positive, negative, or invalid result based on pre-set thresholds. A liquid crystal display (LCD) on the instrument communicates status and results to the operator. The reader supports the use of different assays by reading an assay-specific barcode on the test cartridge. The instrument is not configurable by the user and is maintenance free with a finite lifetime based on either the number of tests performed, the number of days from first use by the end user, or a maximum shelf-life from the date of manufacture.

The bacterial antigens detected by the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Group A Strep test are carbohydrate antigens, not M proteins. Organisms classified as Group A Strep are prone to minor point mutations (i.e., antigenic drift) of the surface M proteins. The BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Group A Strep test is not affected by antigenic drift and shift because it detects the carbohydrate antigen and not the M protein.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Repeatability

A study was conducted to demonstrate the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Group A Strep has acceptable precision near the Limit of Detection (LOD), and that performance characteristics are independent of normal variances that occur between operator to operator and day to day activities.

The sponsor conducted the study over a period of 12 days with two different operators in order to evaluate the precision of the BD Group A Strep test. Each day each operator tested a group of swabs samples that were blinded and randomized and ranged from negative to $5 \%$ positive, $9 5 \%$ positive and $100 \%$ positive. To assess the day-to-day repeatability, one operator also tested 24 blind and randomized swabs.

Swabs were prepared in the same manner that the control swabs are normally prepared. In this case the swabs were dipped in solutions containing various dilutions of Strep A to achieve the requested levels. The swabs were allowed to completely dry and were then pouched with desiccant. These dilutions were determined based on the criteria that one sample be targeted around a high negative, the second sample was targeted to a low positive sample, and the final dilution was targeted to a moderate positive.

All positive and negative swab specimens were masked and randomized prior to testing with the BD Strep A test. For each test, three drops of GAS Reagent 1 were added to a prefilled tube of GAS Reagent 2 and incubated for two minutes. A filter tip was attached to the tube and three drops of solution were dispensed into the sample well of a BD Group A Strep test device. After five minutes at room temperature the device was inserted into the BD Veritor™ System Reader for interpretation. All processed samples were tested in triplicate.

# Reproducibility:

The reproducibility of the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Group A Strep was evaluated at one clinical and two point-of-care (POC) sites. The panel was composed of 4 simulated Group A Strep samples. These included high negative samples (i.e., samples containing a very low concentration of Group A Strep), a low positive sample (near the limit of detection), a moderate positive sample and a negative sample. The panel was tested by two operators at each site over five days. The results are summarized below.

Reproducibility studies are acceptable.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Stability:

Various types of transport media commonly used for the preservation and transport of respiratory specimens were evaluated for specimen storage and stability with the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Group A Strep test. Testing was performed using dilutions of a liquid culture of S. pyogenes diluted to a test signal corresponding to a low positive. BD determined that for a transport medium to be considered acceptable for specimen storage, the BD Group A Strep test must generate a positive test for all spiked samples. Spiked samples that generate a false negative result would not be acceptable for specimen storage.

In this study, various transport media were stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and brought to ambient temperature prior to spiking. The two transport media and normal saline were spiked with S. pyogenes to an amount corresponding to a low positive and tested in triplicate. $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ were added to Veritor System™ Strep A combined GAS Reagents 1 and 2 $( 3 6 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L } )$ . After one minute the processing solution was tested according to the Veritor System™ Strep A Package Insert. The remaining spiked transport media and spiked saline were stored at $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and in the refrigerator for additional time points. An amount of S. pyogenes corresponding to the antigen concentration near to the cutoff was applied to dry swabs and dried for 2 hours at $1 8 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $R H \leq 1 5 \%$ . Three swabs were extracted and tested immediately at the 2 hour time point. The remaining dry swabs were stored at $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and in the refrigerator for additional time points.

Strep A antigen (associated with intact bacteria) was observed to be stable on dry Rayon swabs up to 96 hours (the duration of testing in this study) either refrigerated or stored at room temperature $( 1 5 . 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . Test values ranged between 50 and $100 \%$ of values observed at time zero. In liquid Amies and liquid Stuart medium stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ Strep A antigen levels were stable up to 96 hours. In liquid Amies and liquid Stuart medium stored at $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ Strep A antigen levels increased approximately 4-fold over 96 hours, indicating bacterial growth under these conditions. In normal saline stored at either $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ Strep A antigen levels decreased continuously with storage time. A $50 \%$ decrease was observed between 24 and 48 hours. Testing within 72 hours regardless of transport conditions would appear to be a reasonable recommendation for dry swabs and swabs in either liquid Amies or Stuart Medium. Storage and transport in saline beyond 24 hours is not recommended,

Strep A antigen was shown to be stable either refrigerated or at room temperature on Rayon swabs either dry, or in contact with liquid Amies or liquid Stuart media for up to 96 hours. Normal saline is not indicated as an acceptable storage or transport medium beyond 24 hours.

# Kit Stability Dating:

A combination of real time and accelerated was used to establish the current kit dating of 24 months at $2 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# d. Detection limit

The limit of detection for Streptococcus pyogenes was established with the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Group A Strep test. For this study, the limit of detection (LOD) is defined as the lowest concentration that produces an approximate $9 5 \%$ positive reaction when tested with 60 replicates.

Testing was performed on Lancefield Group A Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 12384, 19615 and 25663. A frozen liquid culture of S. pyogenes $( 4 . 4 \dot { \mathrm { ~ x ~ } } 1 0 ^ { 7 } \mathrm { C F U / m L } )$ was thawed to room temperature and serial ten-fold dilutions were performed using saline. For each test, three drops of GAS Reagent 1 were added to a prefilled tube of GAS Reagent 2. $5 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of each 10-fold dilution was added to the combined extraction reagent and incubated for 2 minutes. A filter tip was attached to the tube and three drops of solution were dispensed into the sample well of a BD Group A Strep test device. After five minutes at room temperature the device was inserted into the BD Veritor™ System Reader for interpretation. All processed samples were tested in triplicate. The lowest ten-fold dilution that was detected as positive in all three BD Group A Strep test devices was further diluted in twofold serial increments in saline and tested as described above to determine the LOD.

The Limit of Detection for S. pyogenes was calculated to be $1 . 0 \mathrm { { x } 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { { C F U } / m L } }$ The sponsor tested 3 strains of S. pyogenes to determine LoD.

Limit of Detection studies are acceptable.

To screen for potential interference, Group A positive samples were prepared to yield a final concentration corresponding to a weak positive. All potentially interfering substances were evaluated by spiking Group A positive samples with the concentrations listed in the table above. Prior to spiking antigen suspensions, the solid interfering substances were dissolved in water or DMSO.

Fifty microliters of each solution were added to the unitized tube containing GAS Reagents 1 and 2. The sample processed for one minute and the attached filter tip was snapped in place. Three drops of the sample were added to a BD Group A Strep test device. After five minutes at room temperature the device was inserted into the BD Veritor™ System Reader for interpretation. All determinations were performed in triplicate.

Substances were considered non-interfering with the BD Group A test if the following criteria were met:

All three replicates showed a Negative result on the Veritor™ System Reader display for Group A Strep using a Strep A Strep negative sample   
All three replicates showed a Positive result on the Veritor ™ System Reader display for Group A Strep using a Group A Strep Positive sample

Of the substances tested in this study, none exhibited interference when either Group A positive or Group A negative samples were tested with the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Group A Strep test.

# Media Compatibility:

Various types of transport media and culture plate media commonly used in Strep A testing were evaluated for compatibility with the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Group A Strep test. The effects of frozen storage of transport media samples on the stability of the antigen were evaluated in this study. The media tested were: Modified Amies, Modified Stuart’s, Normal Saline and Phosphate Buffered Saline. The agar tested were Tryptic Soy Agar with $5 \%$ Sheep Blood and Selective Strep Agar.

Of the four media tested in this evaluation, all four demonstrated the expected results and met the acceptance criteria for both room temperature and overnight frozen storage conditions. Therefore, this suggests that these four media are all compatible with the BD Group A Strep test. Although the media were non-interfering, dry swab transport and storage is recommended for testing with the BD Group A Strep test. Storage and transport of Strep A specimens in liquid transport will likely dilute the antigen while streaking on solid culture media may remove some organism from the swab, thus resulting in a lower number of bacteria introduced into the extraction reagent.

No interference was seen with the agars tested. Interference studies are acceptable.

# Cross-Reactivity Studies:

The cross-reactivity of various Streptococcal strains was determined with the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Group A Strep test. Lancefield Groups A, B, C, D, F and G were tested at $\mathrm { \dot { 1 } X 1 0 ^ { 9 } C F U / m L }$ in triplicate and yielded negative results. Various microorganisms (including bacteria and yeasts) that might be found in specimens were evaluated for potential cross reactivity with the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Group A Strep test.

# Analytical Reactivity:

The reactivity of various Streptococcal strains was determined with the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Group A Strep test by evaluating a panel of six Streptococcal strains representing Lancefield Groups A, B, C, D, F and G. In this study, Bacterial strains obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were grown on Trypticase Soy Agar with $5 \%$ Sheep Blood and further isolated by centrifugation and resuspended in normal saline. Lancefield Groups B, C, D, E, F and G were tested at a concentration of $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 9 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ . Fifty microliters of each diluted bacterial suspension were added to the unitized tube containing GAS Reagents 1 and 2 and the attached filter tip was snapped in place. Three drops of the extracted sample were added to the test well of a BD Group A Strep device. After five minutes at room temperature the device was inserted into the BD Veritor™ System Reader for interpretation. All determinations were performed in triplicate. Analytical Reactivity testing was considered acceptable if the Lancefield

Group A samples produce a positive Strep A reaction with the BD Group A Strep test while all other Lancefield Groups result in a negative Strep A test.

Performance characteristics were established for the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Group A Strep POC kit as compared to the reference method (culture) using diagnostic specimens from symptomatic pediatric and adult patients. A multi-center, prospective study was conducted at four POC centers located in geographically diverse areas within the United States and one clinical laboratory site. The clinical specimen type collected for this study was a throat swab (2 swabs collected simultaneously, one for standard of care and one for the investigational study).

Patient and specimen inclusion and exclusion criteria were as follows.

For the investigational study, one swab specimen was inoculated onto a TSA blood agar plate (BAP) and then tested with the BD Veritor Group A Strep assay following the

procedure provided in the Instructions for Use (IUO) package insert. The second paired swab was inoculated onto a separate blood agar plate and then tested with the site’s standard of care rapid assay.

Bacterial culture was performed following the procedure in the Manual of Clinical Microbiology, $9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ Edition: A bacitracin disk was placed on each BAP and the plates were incubated for 18-24 hours at $3 5 { - } 3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Presence of beta-hemolytic colonies ${ > } 0 . 5$ mm in diameter and any zone of growth inhibition around the bacitracin disk was considered presumptive for Group A streptococci. Beta-hemolytic colonies from the BAP were confirmed as Group A streptococci using a commercially available streptococcal latex agglutination test. If the bacterial culture was negative at 18-24 hours the BAP was reincubated and read again at 48 hours. If beta-hemolytic growth was found at 48 hours, preliminary identification and confirmation were conducted as described above. If no betahemolytic colonies were found on the bacterial culture plate at 48 hours, the specimen was considered negative for Group A streptococci.

# N. Instrument Name:

BD Veritor System Reader

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

The Veritor System Reader is a small, battery powered, bench top instrument that is used to read the Veritor lateral flow test cassette. After the extracted patient sample has been added to the test cassette, the test is developed at room temperature for 10 minutes. The cassette is then placed into the reader where it is scanned. The cassette is divided into distinct zones where the analyzer reads the negative background, positive control, and the Influenza A and B specific zones. The reader applies an algorithm to determine the background of the test as well as the specific signal from the A or B test zones. The reader has a finite number of reads and will prompt the end-user as the total reads approaches the lifetime of the unit.

# 2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes X or No_

3. Specimen Identification: Not Applicable

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling: Not Applicable

5. Calibration:

The Veritor Reader is not configurable by the end user and is designed to have a finite lifetime based on number of tests performed or shelf life from date of manufacture. Device calibration is not required, however, a verification device is provided with the reader to QC the device function.

# 6. Quality Control:

During the course of the clinical studies, quality control (QC) testing was performed for the BD Veritor Group A Strep assay each day testing was performed. QC for the system consisted of a verification cartridge for the instrument, a Group A Strep positive control for the system and a Group A Strep negative control for the system. Results were not used if the QC failed. A QC summary is shown in the Table below:
