# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not applicable

# L. Test Principle:

The BD BACTEC Lytic/10 Anaerobic/F blood culture medium is an enriched soybeancasein digest broth, with each vial containing $4 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of broth. Sodium polyanetholesulfonate (SPS) is added to the medium as an anticoagulant that inhibits bacteriocidal activities in the blood. The concentration of SPS has been optimized to accommodate blood volumes of up to $1 0 \mathrm { m L }$ per vial.

Each BD BACTEC Lytic/10 Anaerobic/F blood culture medium vial contains a chemical sensor in a silicon rubber base that can detect increases in $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ produced by the growth of microorganisms. Three to $1 0 \mathrm { m L }$ of blood is inoculated into the BD BACTEC Lytic/10 Anaerobic/F blood culture medium vial, which is inserted into the BD BACTEC Fluorescent Series instrument for incubation, agitation and periodic measurement. When microorganisms are present in the blood sample, they metabolize nutrients in the culture medium, releasing CO2 into the medium. A dye in the sensor reacts with the CO2, modulating the amount of light that is absorbed by the fluorescent material in the sensor. The instrument’s photo detectors monitor the sensor every 10 minutes and measure the level of fluorescence, which is proportional to the amount of CO2 present in the vial. Positivity of a vial is determined by algorithms resident in the instrument rack’s microprocessor. The algorithms use the rate of CO2 production as well as the absolute increase in CO2 to interpret the data.

Culture vials flagged as presumptively positive are removed from the instrument for subculture and Gram stain in order to identify the microorganisms for further evaluation and proposed patient treatment. Culture vials that are not flagged as positive remain in the instrument until the test protocol has been completed and negative vials are discarded (after 120 hours).

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility

A comparison across three lots study was evaluated in the Percent Recovery study. The lots were manufactured individually with varying key components. Three hundred forty two paired sets (114 paired sets x 3 lots) at the 10 to 100 CFU per vial inoculum level yielded $100 \%$ $9 5 \%$ CI: $9 8 . 9 \%$ , $100 \%$ ) recovery.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

An internal validation study was conducted to evaluate the range of time-todetection in hours was $\leq 7 2$ hours for each of the organisms listed below. The study was conducted across three lots.

Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124   
Bacteroides vulgatus ATCC 8482   
Escherichia coli ATCC 25922   
Clostridium histolyticum ATCC 19401

$^ { \ast } 2 7$ were from 0 to 1 CFU; 2 were from 1 to 10 CFU $\ast \ast 4 4$ from 0 to 1 CFU; 4 from 1 to 10 CFU $\ast \ast \ast 4 4$ from 0 to 1 CFU

There were 29 recovery failures in the plastic vials, 27 of which were at the 0-1 CFU. The two recovery failures at the 1-10 CFU inoculum levels were Clostridium perfringens, Prophyromonas asaccharolytica (formerly Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus) with plate count of 0 and 4 CFU respectively.

An additional recovery study was evaluated at the inoculum of 10- 100 CFU/vial, with no recovery failures. The study included 19 organisms tested at two blood volumes, over three lots on the BACTEC FX, BACTEC 9050, and BACTEC 9240 instruments.

The microbial detection limit study results were acceptable.

e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

Performance of the BD BACTEC Lytic/10 Anaerobic/F (plastic) blood culture vials was evaluated in internal analytical studies to demonstrate comparable performance to the predicate device, the BD BACTEC Lytic/10 Anaerobic/F medium in glass vials. Method comparison results were acceptable.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

# Instrument Time to Detection (TTD) study

The data included 342 paired sets at the 10-100 CFU per vial inoculum level across two blood volume of 3 and $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ ; they were evaluated in both the new and the predicate devices with $100 \%$ recovery. The observed median TTD difference between the paired sets was 10 minutes faster for the BD BACTEC Lytic/10 Anaerobic/F medium contained in a plastic vial. Ninety-five percent of the TTD differences between the paired sets were between -1.68 hours faster for the glass vial and 3 hours faster for the plastic vial.

There were 191 paired sets at the 0-1 and 1-10 CFU per vial inoculum levels that were positive in both the new and predicate devices.

# Percent Recovery Study

A total of 342 paired sets at 10 to 100 CFU per vial were evaluated in the Percent Recovery comparison. The study included 19 organisms (10 anaerobes and 9 aerobes) on three lots with two blood volumes on the BACTEC FX, BACTEC 9050, and BACTEC 9240. All were positive in both the new plastic and the predicate devices. The analysis at the 10-100 CFU per vial inoculum level supports substantial equivalence.

An additional study included a subset of organisms, Finegoldia magna (formerly Peptostreptococcus magnus) and Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (formerly Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus) were evaluated on the BD BACTEC FX instrument at 10 to 100 CFU per vial and demonstrated $100 \%$ recovery in both the BD

BACTEC Lytic/10 Anaerobic/F medium contained in a plastic vial and the BD BACTEC Lytic/10 Anaerobic/F medium contained in a glass vial.

# False Positive Rate

False positivity was assessed with vials inoculated with freshly drawn human blood (i.e. 2, 4, 6, 8 and $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ ). No organisms were added to the vial. There were 240 pair sets across three lots using BACTEC FX and BACTEC 9240. No positive results were observed.

# False Negative Study

Vials that were instrument negative at 120 hours and found to be terminal subculture positive were classified as false negative vials.

The data for this study was generated from the Instrument Time to Detection, Percent Recovery (Sensitivity), and Microbial Detection Limit studies. Vials expected to be positive (i.e., those inoculated with viable organisms) formed the dataset for the False Negative Rate.

A total of 121 pair sets were evaluated by terminal subculture to determine if the results were false negative. All anaerobes were subcultured onto CDC anaerobe $5 \%$ Sheep Blood Agar, incubated anaerobically for five days for determination of no growth, with the results listed below:

Detected in predicate device only 29 Detected in new device only 48 Detected in neither devices (Negatives) 44 paired sets

Of the 29 both instrument and terminal subculture negative from the new plastic vials (i.e. detected in glass vials only), there were 27 that were at the low inoculum level of 0- 1 CFU/mL, six of which had initial plate count of 1-2 CFU: two recovery failures each from Bacteroides vulgatus (initial plate count was 2 CFU), Veilonella parvula (initial plate count was 1 CFU), and Staphylococcus aureus (initial plate count was 1 CFU).

There were 48 instrument and subculture negative results from the glass vials (i.e. detected in plastic vials only); 44 were from the low inoculum level of 0- 1 CFU/mL and nine of which had initial plate count of 1-2 CFU. There were five recovery failures for anaerobes: two for Bacteroides vulgatus, one Fusobacterium nucleatum, and two for Veilonella parvula.

There were no false negative results observed in either the new plastic or the glass vials, indicating that the low inoculum might not have been inoculated into the vials.

# BACTEC Instrument Compatibility

A total of 114 paired sets (new and predicate devices) were tested in each the BACTEC FX, BACTEC 9240 and BACTEC 9050 fluorescent-series blood culture instruments at the 10-100 CFU per vial inoculum level. A recovery comparison of the new device versus the predicate device results demonstrated that all 114 paired sets were positive in both the new and the predicate devices in each of the BACTEC fluorescent series blood culture instruments.

All comparison studies results were acceptable.
