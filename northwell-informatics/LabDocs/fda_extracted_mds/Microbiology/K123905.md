# Device Description

The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is used in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument. The panel consists of oligonucleotide primers and dual-labeled hydrolysis (TaqMan®) probes to be used in rRT-PCR for the in vitro qualitative detection and characterization of human influenza viruses from viral RNA in respiratory specimens from patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI).

The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is based on technology which is used in many molecular diagnostic assays. rRT-PCR assays are one-tube assays that first reversetranscribe specific regions of RNA into cDNA copies. The cDNA then serves as a template for a polymerase chain reaction that utilizes a thermocyclic heating and cooling of the reaction to logarithmically amplify a specific region of DNA. The probe anneals to a specific internal target sequence located between the target loci of the forward and reverse primers. During the extension phase of the PCR cycle, the 5' nuclease activity of Taq polymerase degrades any probe molecules hybridized to amplified target sequence, causing the reporter dye to separate from the quencher dye, and generating a fluorescent signal. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes, increasing the fluorescence intensity. Fluorescence intensity is monitored at each PCR cycle. Amplification of targets is reflected by logarithmic increase in fluorescence over time in comparison to the background signal.

# Intended Use

The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is intended for use in rRTPCR assays on an ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information:

For qualitative detection of influenza virus type A or B viral RNA in upper respiratory tract clinical specimens (including nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS], nasal swabs [NS], throat swabs [TS], nasal aspirates [NA], nasal washes [NW] and dual nasopharyngeal/throat swabs [NPS/TS]) and lower respiratory tract specimens (including bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL], bronchial wash [BW], tracheal aspirate [TA], sputum, and lung tissue) from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture. For determination of the subtype of seasonal human influenza A virus as seasonal A/H1, A/H3, and/or A/H1pdm09 from viral RNA in upper respiratory tract clinical specimens (including NPS, NS, TS, NA, NW, and NPS/TS) and lower respiratory tract specimens (including BAL, BW, TA, sputum and lung tissue) from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture. For the presumptive identification of virus in patients who may be infected with influenza A subtype A/H5 (Asian Lineage) from viral RNA in human respiratory specimens and viral culture in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. ? •   
To provide epidemiologic information or urveillance of circulating influenza viuses.

Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a season when seasonal influenza viruses A/H1 and A/H3 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation and during a season when the A/H1pdm09 influenza virus was the predominant influenza A virus in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary with other emerging influenza A viruses.

Testing with the influenza H5a and H5b primer and probe sets should not be performed unless the patient meets the most current U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) clinical and epidemiologic criteria for testing suspect A/H5 specimens. The definitive identification of influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) either directly from patient specimens or from virus cultures requires additional laboratory testing, along with clinical and epidemiological assessment in consultation with national influenza surveillance experts.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

All users, analysts. and any person reporting results from use of this device should be trained to   
perform and interpret the results from this procedure by a competent instructor prior to use. CDC Influenza Division will limit the distribution of this device to only those users who have successfully completed a training course provided by CDC instructors or designees.

# Indications for Use

# Clinical Specimen Testing

From July 2012-August 2012, a total of 165 human respiratory specimens that tested positive for InfA, H3, and pdmInfA markers and negative for H1 and pdmH1 markers with the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel were transferred from U.S. public health laboratories to the CDC for confirmatory testing.

The specimens were retested upon arrival with the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel following the instructions for use provided in the package insert. Results were confirmed through genetic sequence analysis. Comparison of the results obtained with the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to the results of the genetic sequencing analysis demonstrate a positive percent agreement of $9 7 . 6 \%$ with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $9 3 . 9 \mathrm { - } 9 9 . 1 \ \%$ for the detection of influenza A(H3N2)v virus.

Any result that was not positive for all three markers InfA, pdm InfA, and H3 was considered negative. $\mathsf { N A } =$ not applicable.

# Risk Analysis

The risk analysis for the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel was reviewed to verify that the change did not present increased or new risks to the user. No new risks were identified as a result of the proposed modification. As an additional mitigation, specimens containing influenza A (H3N2)v viruses will continue to be referred immediately to the CDC for further confirmation.

# Substantial Equivalence Conclusion

The changes proposed to the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel do not alter the device's design or technological attributes. In addition, the indications for use and intended use of the device will remain the same. It is only the interpretation of the results that will be modified, allowing users to report the result as a presumptive positive for influenza A (H3N2) variant virus instead of inconclusive. This information, along with the results of the performance testing, demonstrates that the modified device is substantially equivalent to the predicate.

The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is intended for use in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information:

For qualitative detection of influenza virus type A or B from viral RNA in upper   
respiratory tract clinical specimens (including nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS], nasal swabs [NS], throat swabs [TS], nasal aspirates [NA], nasal washes [NW] and dual   
nasopharyngeal/throat swabs [NPS/TS], and lower respiratory tract specimens (including bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL], bronchial wash [BW], tracheal aspirate [TA], sputum, and lung tissue) from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture;   
For determination of the subtype of seasonal human influenza A virus as seasonal A/H1, A/H3, and/or A/H1 pdm09 from viral RNA in upper respiratory tract clinical specimens (including NPS, NS, TS, NA, NW and NPS/TS) and lower respiratory tract specimens (including BAL, BW, TA, sputum and lung tissue) from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture;   
For the presumptive identification of virus in patients who may be infected with influenza A subtype A/H5 (Asian lineage) from viral RNA in human respiratory specimens and vira culture in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors;   
To provide epidemiologic information for surveillance of circulating influenza viruses.

Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a season when influenza viruses $\mathring { \mathbf { A } } / \mathrm { H } 1$ and A/H3 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation and during a season when the A/H1 pdm09 influenza virus was the predominant influenza A virus in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary with other emerging influenza A viruses.

Testing with the influenza H5a and H5b primer and probe sets should not be performed unless the patient meets the most current U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) clinical and epidemiologic criteria for testing suspect A/H5 specimens. The definitive identification of influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) either directly from patient specimens or from virus cultures requires additional laboratory testing, along with clinical and epidemiological assessment in consultation with national influenza surveillance experts.
