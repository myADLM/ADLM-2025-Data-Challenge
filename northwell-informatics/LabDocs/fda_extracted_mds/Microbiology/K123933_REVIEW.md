# I. Device Description:

MicroScan Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panels are designed for use in determining quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on solid media of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-positive bacteria.

The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are miniaturizations of the broth dilution susceptibility test that have been diluted in broth and dehydrated. Various antimicrobial agents are diluted in broth to concentrations bridging the range of clinical interest. Panels are rehydrated with water after inoculation with a standardized suspension of the organism. After incubation in a non- $C \mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ incubator for 16-20 hours, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test organism is read by determining the lowest antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth. The panels can be read manually using the MicroSCAN Microdilution Viewer or on automated MicroSCAN instrumentation (autoSCAN4 or WalkAway systems).

Ceftaroline is a cephalosporin antibacterial agent with activity against grampositive bacteria. The bactericidal action of Ceftaroline is mediated through binding to essential penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). The concentrations of Ceftaroline tested in the MicroScan panel range from $0 . 0 6 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ to $1 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

Ceftaroline is indicated for treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, when caused by susceptible strains of the designated organism.

The MIC interpretive criteria for Ceftaroline are as follows:

Note: Clinical efficacy of Ceftaroline to treat lower respiratory infections such as community-acquired pneumonia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus

aureus (MRSA) has not been studied in adequate and well controlled clinical trials.

aThere are no intermediate or resistant interpretive criteria for Ceftaroline. The current absence of resistant isolates precludes defining any results other than “Susceptible.” Isolates yielding MIC results other than “Susceptible” should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.

# L. Test Principle:

The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are miniaturizations of the broth dilution susceptibility test which have been dehydrated. Various antimicrobial agents are diluted in Mueller-Hinton broth with calcium and magnesium to concentrations bridging the range of clinical interest. After inoculation and rehydration with a standardized suspension of organism and incubation at $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 16-20 hours, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) or a qualitative susceptibility (Susceptible, Intermediate or Resistant) for the test organism is determined by observing the lowest antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility data for $1 1 \ S .$ aureus isolates including 5 methicillinsusceptible strains and 6 methicillin-resistant strains (10 Challenge isolates and 1 QC strain) were generated at 3 clinical trial sites. Organism selection was based on the intended use of the antimicrobic and favored strains for which the MIC was close to the breakpoints. Each strain was tested at each site in triplicate over three days using 2 inoculation methods [Turbidity and Prompt] and 3 reading methods (manual, WalkAway Instrument and autoSCAN-4 Instrument). Replicates were prepared using individually prepared inocula.

The mode of the test panel MIC results (or the median value for those results without a mode) was determined for each isolate. MIC results at each site were compared to the mode/median value. Results were considered in agreement if the test panel MIC was equal to or within $\pm \nobreakspace 1 \nobreakspace$ dilution of the mode/median for that isolate.

All MIC results were on-scale for both inoculation methods and all reading methods; therefore, best case and worst case scenarios were identical.

For all sites combined, results obtained with all inoculation and reading methods were $\geq 9 7 . 0 \%$ .

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The recommended Quality Control isolate (S. aureus ATCC 29213) was tested a sufficient number of times at all testing sites using both the Turbidity and Prompt inoculation methods and the three reading methods. Acceptable results $( \geq 9 8 . 5 ~ \%$ of results within the acceptable range) as compared to the reference method were obtained for all inoculation and reading methods. The Ceftaroline test results demonstrate that the system can produce QC results within the expected range.

Growth Failure Rate: All isolates tested during the clinical (efficacy) trials grew in both the frozen reference panel and the dried MicroScan panels.

Purity check plates were performed to detect contamination during the clinical (efficacy) trials at the clinical sites. No contamination was recorded at any site.

Inoculum Density check: The MicroScan Turbidity Meter and Prompt method were used to standardize the inoculum. Turbidity meter readings were recorded each day of use. The Turbidity meter was previous cleared by FDA (K864542). Colony count validation data was reviewed and found to be acceptable.

The quality control study results are acceptable.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The MicroScan Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel with Ceftaroline results were compared to results obtained using a frozen broth microdilution panel prepared according to CLSI M07-A9 guidelines, except for the use of Pluronic-F in the inoculum water for the reference panel. All isolates were tested using the nine dilutions of Ceftaroline. Dilutions tested were appropriate for the interpretive breakpoints for the drug. For each organism tested, MIC panels were inoculated using the same standardized suspension, further diluted into $2 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of water with either Pluronic–D (for the MicroScan dried panels) or Pluronic-F (for the frozen reference panels.) Performance was analyzed using FDA breakpoints for Ceftaroline, and results were compared based on the guidelines provided in the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems.

A validation study was performed to demonstrate equivalence between reference panels inoculated with water supplemented with Pluronic-F and reference panels inoculated with autoclaved distilled water without PluronicF. The essential agreement for Pluronic-F vs. autoclaved distilled water was $100 \%$ .

A total of $3 0 6 S .$ aureus clinical isolates were tested at 3 clinical trial sites, including a total of 166 methicillin-susceptible strains, and 140 methicillinresistant strains. Of the total, 289 isolates were fresh (less than 7 days from isolation) and 17 were stock isolates. Clinical isolates were tested using inocula prepared using the turbidity method (MicroScan Turbidity Meter) and read manually.

A total of 75 Challenge isolates were tested at one clinical trial site. Organism selection for the Challenge isolates was based on the intended use of Ceftaroline and favored strains for which the MIC was close to the breakpoint. Expected results were determined from the mode result obtained from 18

replicates of each isolate tested using a frozen reference panel prepared using CLSI M07-A9 guidelines. Challenge isolates were tested using inocula prepared using both the turbidity method and the Prompt Inoculation System. Results were read using 3 methods: manual read, WalkAway Instrument and autoSCAN-4 Instrument.

Combined results from clinical and challenge studies demonstrated an overall EA of $9 9 . 0 \%$ (377/381) and an overall CA of $9 9 . 5 \%$ (379/381) for the turbidity inoculation method with manual read.

According to the approved drug label for Ceftaroline, only a susceptible interpretive category is defined. There are no intermediate or resistant interpretive categories. In this study, there were 2 instances in which the MicroScan panel results gave a categorical interpretation for Ceftaroline that was not in agreement with the reference broth dilution MIC [reference method results were non-susceptible $( \mathrm { M I C } = 2 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ ), while the MicroScan results were susceptible $( \mathrm { M I C } = 1 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ ).] Even though the approved drug label does not define “non-susceptible” breakpoints, FDA considered this to be a potential very major error and indicative of potential “trending” at one dilution lower than expected. Recommendations were included in the labeling that isolates yielding MIC results suggestive of a non-susceptible result should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing. In addition, the labeling cautions users to test $S .$ . aureus isolates that have MICs of $1 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ with an alternative testing method when indicated for patient care to reduce the risk of very major errors.

The performance evaluation summary of essential and categorical agreement results for challenge and clinical isolates is shown in the table below.
