The modified Breath $\mathsf { I D @ }$ Hp System is a non-invasive breath test system for detecting the presence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). The system consists of an electro-optical medical device with embedded software designed to measure and compute the changes in the ratio between $^ { 1 3 } \mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ and $^ { 1 2 } \mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ concentrations in the patient's exhalation and a test kit. The test kit consists of:

• IDcircuit™M - Oridion Nasal FilterLine ™ (nasal cannula) (K980325)   
• A 75mg $^ { 1 3 } \mathsf { C }$ -urea tablet A 4.3g package of powdered Citrica (citric acid)   
• Drinking straw Package Insert (Instructions for Use)

# Exalenz Bioscience Ltd. - Traditional 510(k) - Modified BreathID® Hp System Section 7: 510(k) Summary

The modified BreathlD® Hp System measures and computes the ratio between $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ and $^ { 1 2 } \mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ in the patient's exhalation before and after the ingestion of $^ { 1 3 } 0$ -urea. The change in the $^ { 1 3 } \cos _ { 2 } 1$ $^ { 1 2 } \mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ at ben tio $^ { 1 3 } \mathsf { C }$ urea is referred to as the Delta over Baseline (DOB).

The basis of the $^ { 1 3 } \mathsf { C }$ measurement method for both the modified and unmodified versions of the BreathID® System is a technology called Molecular Correlation Spectroscopy™ (MCS™). MCS™m is based on the concept of optical absorption of specific radiation emitted from $\complement \bigcirc _ { 2 }$ discharge lamps.

# Intended Use / Indications for Use:

The Exalenz Breath $D \oplus$ Hp System is intended for use to continually and non-invasively measure changes in the $^ { 1 3 } \mathsf { C O } _ { 2 } \mid ^ { 1 2 } \mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ ratio of exhaled breath, which may be indicative of increased urease production associated with active Helicobacter pylori $( H , p y / o r i )$ infection in the stomach. The Exalenz Breath $1 0 \textcircled { \times }$ Hp System is indicated for use as an aid in the initial diagnosis and post treatment monitoring of $H .$ pylori infection in adult patients. The Exalenz Breath $| \mathbb { D } \emptyset \rangle$ Hp System consists of the IDkit:Hp ™ and the Breath $1 0 \textcircled { \times }$ Hp test device.

The device is for use by trained health care professionals. To be administered under a physician's supervision.

# Comparison of Technological Characteristics:

The key characteristics of the modified Breathl $D \otimes$ Hp System are substantially equivalent to the prior cleared version of the device in all regards. Any differences are minor, are supported by testing, and do not raise new types of questions of substantial equivalence.

The modified BreathlD@ Hp System has the same fundamental scientific technology and principle of operation utilized in the unmodified BreathID $\textcircled{8}$ System. The technological modifications of the Breath $1 0 \textcircled { \times }$ Hp System are modifications to the configuration of the system and software revisions as a result of the modified hardware configuration.

This modified Breath $1 0 \textcircled { \times }$ Hp System is designed to be more compact, less expensive and easier to maintain than the unmodified system. In addition, the modified BreathID® Hp System either eliminates or consolidates components that have become redundant or obsolete.

# Comparison of Intended Use:

There are no significant changes in the intended use or the indications for use between the modified Breath $1 0 \textcircled { \times }$ Hp System and the unmodified BreathID® System. The use environment, target user, and patient population of the modified Breathi $\boldsymbol { \Omega } \boldsymbol { \otimes }$ Hp System are the same as the unmodified device.

# Substantial Equivalence:

The following tables summarize the similarities and differences of the Exalenz BreathID® System cleared in K011668 to the modified Exalenz Breath $\left[ \left[ \mathbf { R } \right] \right]$ Hp System that is the subject of this $5 1 0 ( 1 \times )$ submission.

# Discussion of Differences

All diferences between the modified and unmodified versions of the device have been formally verified or validated to ensure that the changes do not impact.device specifications or performance.

The device instructions for use have been updated to reflect the changes made to the operator / device interface and to incorporate the clinical performance characteristics of the device itself.The changes made do not alter the Indications / Contraindications or Warnings / Precautions.

The hardware / physical configuration has been modified in comparison to the unmodified BreathiD® System. As demonstrated by the results of verification and validation, the modified hardware $i$ physical configuration of the modified BreathlD® Hp System does not have an effect on performance or substantial equivalence as compared to the unmodified BreathID® System.

Software changes have been implemented for the modified Breath $1 0 \textcircled { \times }$ Hp System related to the modified hardware configuration of the device. The software changes do not affect the safety and effectiveness of the modified Breath $1 0 \textcircled { ‰}$ Hp System as compared to the unmodified BreathID® System.

# Summary of Performance Bench Testing

Exalenz has performed verification and validation bench testing for demonstration of substantial equivalence of the modified Breathi $1 0 \textcircled { \times }$ Hp System to the unmodified BreathID@ System. The following key verification and validation bench tests are the most significant for establishing substantial equivalence:

Gas Collection Verification   
• System Check Verification   
• Comparative Validation   
• Analytical Studies Precision Validation Reproducibility Validation Software Verification and Validation

A summary of the Gas Collection Verification, System Check Verification, Software Verification and Validation, Comparative Validation, Precision Validation and Reproducibility Validation is provided below.

# Gas Collection Verification

A Gas Collection Verification was performed to verify that the $^ { 1 2 } \mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ cell of the $^ { 1 3 } \mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ and $^ { 1 2 } \mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ measurement subsystem of the Breath $| \boldsymbol { \mathsf { D } } \boldsymbol { \mathfrak { Q } } |$ Hp System could adequately replace the Capnograph of the unmodified BreathID® System for measuring the $C O _ { 2 }$ concentration in incoming gases. Twenty (20) tests were performed with breath samples that were not $^ { 1 3 } \mathsf { C }$ enriched from ten (10) different subjects. Each of the twenty (20) tests also included seven (7) DOB measurements from the measurement phase (MP) in various calibration ranges. The results of the Gas Collection Verification demonstrated that the DOB standard deviation of all measurement phase (MP) test results were within the specifications, all MP test sample concentrations were within the calibration range, and that all MP sample concentrations had a standard deviation of less than 0.2. Therefore, the $\phantom { } ^ { 1 2 } \vec { \mathrm { C O } } _ { 2 }$ cell of the $^ { 1 3 } \mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ and $^ { 1 2 } \mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ measurement subsystem of the Breath $1 0 \textcircled { \times }$ Hp System has been verified to adequately replace the Capnograph of the unmodified BreathlD $\oplus$ System for measuring the $\complement \mathsf { O } _ { 2 }$ concentration in incoming gases.

# System Check Verification

A System Check Verification was performed to verify that operator breath or pre-dose patient breath could adequately replace the gas canister containing approximately $100 \%$ $\complement \cap _ { 2 }$ for the purposes of the System Check, one of the Quality Control functions of the BreathID® Hp System and the unmodified Breath $1 0 \textcircled { \times }$ System. Twenty (20) tests were performed with breath samples from eleven (11) different subjects. Each of the twenty (20) tests also included seven (7) DOB measurements. The results of the System Check Verification demonstrated that in all cases where the $^ { 1 2 } \mathsf { C }$ curves

Page 7-6 of 13

# Exalenz Bioscience Ltd. - Traditional 510(k) - Modified BreathID® Hp System Section 7: 510(k) Summary

were randomly changed and a calibration was then required, the situation was correctly identified by the BreathlD® Hp System and a calibration was performed. In all cases where the $^ { 1 2 } \dot { \mathsf { C } }$ curves were unchanged and the calibration process was unable to expand the calibration range, the Breath $0 \otimes$ Hp System correctly identified the situation and did not perform a calibration. In the case where the $^ { 1 2 } \mathrm { { C } }$ c w chan, t  aliatin  as expand  calaton as required the Breath $1 0 \textcircled { \times }$ Hp System correctly identified the situation and performed a calibration. All test results following a System Check and calibration were within the specifications of the Breath $\mathsf { D @ }$ Hp'System. Additionally, all test results following a System Check that did not require calibration were within the specifications of the Breathi $1 0 \textcircled { \times }$ Hp System. Therefore, the System Check Verification not only demonstrated that operator breath or pre-dose patient breath could be adequately used for the System Check procedure, but it also demonstrated that the calibration process was effective.

# Software Verification and Validation

Software Verification evaluated all system functionality and consisted of evaluations of the software through unit, integration and system level testing, as well as code reviews. Software Validation consisted of various test cases to qualitatively test the software system of the BreathID@ Hp System. The test case categories that were utilized for the software validation of the Breath $1 0 \otimes$ Hp System were:

H. Pylori Patient Mode Tests   
System Test   
Utilities, and   
System Failures

All test cases were implemented with a known input and an expected output. The expected output was visually. compared against the actual output. All test cases were verified to have passing results.

# Comparative Validation

A Comparative Validation was performed to evaluate the agreement of the modified BreathlD® Hp System DOB measurements to its predicate device, the unmodified BreathID® System. The Comparative Validation was performed in accordance with the following standard:

Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute EP09-A2 Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples; Approved Guideline - Second Edition

The Comparative Validation was performed with three H. pylori samples that included a high positive, low positive and moderate positive, as defined in the FDA Draft Guidance "Establishing Performance Characteristics of In Vitro Diagnostic Devices for the Detection of Helicobacter pylori," September 23, 2010. The Comparative Validation was performed with one modified BreathID® Hp System and one unmodified BreathID® System, executing two runs per day for five days. Each test run included three different combinations of baseline / post-ingestion gases and each combination of baseline / post-ingestion gases was consecutively tested twice. The modified Breath $1 0 \textcircled { \times }$ Hp System and the unmodified BreathiD0 System were evaluated simultaneously by connecting the two devices with a Y-Connector. Calibration was performed on the first day of the Comparative Validation. Table 7-3 below provides the results and analysis of the Comparative Validation.

# Summary of Clinical Validation

Exalenz conducted a clinical validation to demonstrate that the modified Breath $1 0 \textcircled { \times }$ Hp System is substantially equivalent to the unmodified Breath $1 0 \textcircled { 1 8 }$ System.

A single center, non-randomized, blinded, comparative study was conducted to compare the modified Breath $1 0 \textcircled { \times }$ Hp System to the unmodified BreathID $\otimes$ System. The breath test was performed according to the standard procedure described in the device's instructions for use and routine clinical practice while the subject was connected simultaneously to both the BreathlD® Hp System and the unmodified BreathID $\textcircled{8}$ device via two standard nasal cannulae. The outcome measures of both devices were used for the comparison.

in order to prevent a spectrum bias, the breath test was performed in addition to, and independent of the local clinical practice. In cases were a serum blood test was performed, these blood tests were the only means used to diagnose the presence of H. pylori. In other cases, where the investigator did not feel a blood test was warranted (change in diet prescribed, or symptoms not specific to $H .$ pylori), the patient was periodically followed up at the clinic as routine general practice with no eradication therapy prescribed. In these cases, only if symptoms persisted or became more related H. pylori infection, was the patient sent or blood tess.The breath testing was performed by a site technician and not in the proximity of the Principal Investigator.The breath test results were made available to the treating physician (Principal Investigator) only once the patient's management protocol had been determined. Thus, the test results from both devices were masked from the treating physician and did not have an impact on the patient's treatment.

The clinical study was conducted in compliance with its protocol and in accordance with the ethical principles under Investigational Review Board (IRB) approval consistent with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and with applicable regulatory requirements. Table 7-9 below presents the subjects' accountability and the subjects' baseline characteristics per protocol (PP).

# PP Analysis Set

The PP analysis set consisted of all subjects enrolled in the study that did not have any major protocol deviations and had no other relevant $H$ pylori testing prior to enrollment in the study, which was defined as no positive test results within 2012 and no negative test results within three months prior to enrollment. The cross tabulation of the diagnosis as assessed by both the modified and unmodified BreathID® Systems in the PP analysis set is provided in Table 7-10 below. The PP analysis set included 79 valid subjects per the protocol.
