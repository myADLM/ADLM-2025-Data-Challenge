# Device Description

The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is used in real-time RT-PCR assays (rRT-PCR) on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument. The device consists of oligonucleotide primers and dual-labeled hydrolysis (TaqMan®) probes to be used in rRT-PCR for the in vitro qualitative detection and characterization of human influenza viruses from viral RNA in respiratory specimens from patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI).

The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is based on technology which is used in many molecular diagniostic assays. rRT-PCR assays are one-tube assays that first reversetranscribe specific regions of RNA into cDNA copies. The cDNA then serves as a template for a polymerase chain reaction that utilizes thermocyclic heating and cooling of the reaction to

logarithmically amplify a specific region of DNA. The probe anneals to a specific internal target sequence located between the target loci of the forward and reverse primers. During the extension phase of the PCR cycle, the 5' exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase degrades any probe molecules hybridized to amplified target sequence, causing the reporter dye to separate from the quencher dye, and generating a fluorescent signal. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes, increasing the fluorescence intensity. Fluorescence intensity is monitored at each PCR cycle. The amplification of each target is reflected by a logarithmic increase in fluorescence in comparison to the background signal.

# Intended Use

The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is intended for use in rRTPCR assays on an ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information:

For qualitative detection of influenza virus type A or B viral RNA in upper respiratory tract clinical specimens (including nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS], nasal swabs [NS], throat swabs [TS], nasal aspirates [NA], nasal washes [NW] and dual nasopharyngeal/throat swabs [NPS/TS]) and lower respiratory tract specimens (including bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL], bronchial wash [BW], tracheal aspirate [TA], sputum, and lung tissue) from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture. For determination of the subtype of seasonal human influenza A viruses as seasonal A/H1, A/H3, and/or A/H1pdm09 from viral RNA in upper respiratory tract clinical specimens (including NPS, NS, TS, NA, NW, and NPS/TS) and lower respiratory tract specimens (including BAL, BW, TA, sputum and lung tissue) from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture. For the presumptive identification of virus in patients who may be infected with influenza A subtype A/H5 (Asian Lineage) from viral RNA in human respiratory specimens and viral culture in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. To provide epidemiological information for surveillance of circulating influenza viruses.

Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a season when seasonal influenza viruses A/H1 and A/H3 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation and during a season when the A/H1pdm09 influenza virus was the predominant influenza A virus in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary with other emerging influenza A viruses.

Testing with the influenza H5a and H5b primer and probe sets should not be performed unless the patient meets the most current U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) clinical and epidemiological criteria for testing suspect A/H5 specimens. The definitive identification of influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) either directly from patient specimens or from virus cultures requires additional laboratory testing, along with clinical and epidemiological assessment in consultation with national influenza surveillance experts.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

All users, analysts, and any person reporting results from use of this device should be trained to   
perform and interpret the results from this procedure by a competent instructor prior to use. CDC Influenza Division will limit the distribution of this device to only those users who have successfully completed a training course provided by CDC instructors or designees.

# Analytical Performance Evaluation Analytical Sensitivity - Limit of Detection Study (LOD)

Analytical sensitivity was demonstrated by determining the LOD of each primer and probe set in the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel using Quanta qScript™M to demonstrate equivalency to the LOD using Invitrogen SuperScript™M. Serial dilutions of two different influenza virus strains representing influenza B, A/H1, A/H3, A/H5 and A/H1pdm09 were tested to identify an end-point for detection using both enzymes. RNA was purified from each of the characterized viruses using one of the cleared extraction procedures. The LOD for each primer and probe et was calculated to indicate he range of the lowest detectable concentration o influenza virus $\mathrm { ( E I D _ { 5 0 } / m L }$ or $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L } ,$ at which $\ge 9 5 \%$ o al replicates tested positive. The lowest concentration of influenza virus detected determined the end-point concentration where both the type and subtype primer and probe sets had uniform detection. If the two endpoints differed in concentration, the lowest concentration where the endpoints had uniform detection was reported as the LOD. In all cases, the resulting LOD was either the same or within one 5-old dilution of the comparator (Invitrogen SuperScript™M). The results are summarized in Table 8-3.

# Analytical Sensitivity - Inclusivity Testing

The inclusivity of the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel using Quanta qScript™M was examined by testing two influenza viruses of each type and subtype against the corresponding target assay within the panel at concentrations at or near the established LOD. Virus RNA was isolated using one of the cleared extraction chemistries and serially diluted to approximately 102 EID50 /mL. The performance of Quanta qScript™M was compared to Invitrogen SuperScript™M by testing each virus RNA preparation in triplicate with the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT. PCR Diagnostic Panel.

Table 8-4 summarizes the results of the inclusivity testing of the CDC Human Influenza Virus Realtime RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel with both the investigational (Quanta qScript™M) and comparator (Invitrogen SuperScript™M) enzyme systems.

# Clinical Performance Evaluation

A prospective clinical study was conducted during the 201 1-2012 influenza season to compare the performance of the CDC Human Influenza rRT-PCR Diagnostic Panel using Quanta qScriptTM and Invitrogen Superscript™M. Residual material from a total of 1,002 respiratory specimens from patients who were symptomatic for influenza-like illness (ILl) was collected and tested at 6 clinical sites. Nine hundred thirty-one specimens were included in the data analysis after exclusion of samples with inconclusive results (42), technician or instrument error (25), or unspecified specimen type (4).

# Expected Values

During February 25, 2012 to May 19, 2012, World Health Organization and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) collaborating laboratories in the United States tested 47,281 respiratory specimens for influenza viruses. Of these, 9,415 $( 1 9 . 9 \% )$ were positive: $85 \%$ of the positive specimens were positive for influenza A viruses and $1 5 \%$ were positive for influenza B viruses. Among the 5,071 influenza A viruses for which subtyping was performed, 3,680 $( 7 2 . 6 \% )$ were influenza A/H3 viruses and 1,391 $( 2 7 . 4 \% )$ were 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses.

# Prospective Study Comparison

The performance of each assay within the panel, with the exception of the H5a and H5b assays, was demonstrated at each clinical site using both enzymes. The results from the prospective study are summarized in Table 8-6 showing the percent sensitivity or specificity with the two-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence interval.

# Retrospective Study Comparison

Due to the absence of seasonal influenza A/H1N1, retrospective specimens from a previous clinical study conducted during the 2006-2007 influenza season were used to supplement the clinical evaluation. The study director used historical study results to select specimens containing varying concentrations of seasonal influenza A/H1N1. No negative specimens were selected since the prospective study provided sufficient numbers of negative specimens for comparing the specificity of the investigational enzyme with the A/H1 marker assay. The results of the retrospective specimen testing are summarized in Table 8-7.

Due to the lack of available clinical specimens containing influenza A/H5N1, evaluation of the performance of the H5a and H5b primer and probe sets was addressed with an alternative approach. Samples for the retrospective study were prepared according to a method using a characterized and titered stock of influenza A/H5N1 virus and human A549 cells (Lednicky et al.). The stock virus was added to the A549 cell suspension in high, moderate, and low concentrations with 12 samples at each concentration. The low virus concentration was prepared to approximate the LOD of the A/H5 assay. Test results of simulated A/H5N1 samples are summarized in Tables 8-8 to 8-10.

# Intended Use

# Device Name: CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel

Intended Use:

The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is intended for use in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information:

For qualitative detection of influenza virus type A or B from viral RNA in upper respiratory tract clinical specimens (including nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS], nasal swabs [NS], throat swabs [TS], nasal aspirates [NA], nasal washes [NW] and dual nasopharyngeal/throat swabs [NPS/TS]), and lower respiratory tract specimens (including bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL], bronchial wash [BW], tracheal aspirate [TA], sputum, and lung tissue) from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture; For determination of the subtype of seasonal human influenza A viruses as seasonal A/H1, A/H3, and/or A/H 1 pdm09 from viral RNA in upper respiratory tract clinical specimens (including NPS, NS, TS, NA, NW and NPS/TS) and lower respiratory tract specimens (including BAL, BW, TA, sputum and lung tissue) from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture; For the presumptive identification of virus in patients who may be infected with influenza A subtype A/H5 (Asian lineage) from viral RNA in human respiratory specimens and viral culture in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors; To provide epidemiological information for surveillance of circulating influenza viruses.

Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a season when seasonal influenza viruses A/H1 and A/H3 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation and during a season when the A/H1 pdm09 influenza virus was the predominant influenza A virus in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary with other emerging influenza A viruses.

Testing with the influenza H5a and H5b primer and probe sets should not be performed unless the patient meets the most current U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) clinical and epidemiological criteria for testing suspect A/H5 specimens. The definitive identification of influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) either directly from patient specimens or from virus cultures requires additional laboratory testing, along with clinical and epidemiological assessment in consultation with national influenza surveillance experts.

Negative results do not preclude ifluenza virus infection and should not be used as the olebasis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-nfection with other viruses.The agent detected may not be the deinite cause of disease.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is availableto receiveand culture peens.

All users, analysts, and any person reporting results from use of this device should be trained to   
perform and interpret the results from this procedure by a competent instructor prior to use. CDC Influenza Division will limit the distribution of this device to only those users who have successfully completed a training course provided by CDC instructors or designees.
