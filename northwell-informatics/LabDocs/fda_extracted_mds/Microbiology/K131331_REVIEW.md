The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is intended for in vitro quantitative determination of antimicrobial susceptibility by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of most Gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria isolates from pure culture for Enterobacteriaceae and Non-Enterobacteriaceae and most Gram-positive bacteria isolates from pure culture belonging to the genera Staphylococcus, Enterococcus and Streptococcus.

This premarket notification is for a modification of a portion of the algorithm for Vancomycin $0 . 5 { - } 3 2 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ with Enterococcus species and Staphylococcus species and updates for software from the last software cleared by FDA under K040099 through version 6.01.

Vancomycin has been shown to be active in vitro against most strains of microorganisms listed below, as described in the FDA-approved package insert for this antimicrobial agent.

# Active In Vitro and in Clinical Infections Against:

Enterococci (e.g., Enterococcus faecalis)   
Staphylococci, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (including heterogeneous methicillin-resistant strains).

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements: BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System, software version 6.01

# I. Device Description:

# This submission is for the AST Panel only. The ID system was not reviewed.

The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and equated to a $0 . 5 \mathrm { M c F }$ arland with the recommendation to use BD nephelometer devices. A further dilution is made into an AST broth, which turns to blue after AST broth indicator is added prior to inoculating the panel. The AST broth is a cation-adjusted formulation of Mueller-Hinton broth containing $0 . 0 1 \%$ Tween 80, and has a final inoculum of approximately $5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ . After inoculation and incubation, the color changes to pink then to colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System instrument where the panels are incubated at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and continuously measured of changes to the indicator as well as bacterial turbidity to determine the bacterial growth in the presence of an antimicrobial agent. Organisms growing in the presence of a given antimicrobial agent reduce the indicator, signaling organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobial agent. Organisms killed or inhibited by a given antimicrobial do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do not produce a color change. Additional interpretation is done using software driven “EXPERT” System using rules derived from the CLSI documentation.

Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an AST result available between 4-16 hours. This is only an autoread result; no manual readings are possible with this system.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”

CLSI M7-A8, “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically”

CLSI M100, S22 “Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing”

# L. Test Principle:

The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth based microdilution method that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance detection of organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control wells” which contains no antibiotic.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility testing was performed at three sites (one internal and two external) in triplicate on three separate days using inoculum prepared manually and inoculum using the BD Phoenix AP. Inter-site and Intra-site testing demonstrated best-case reproducibility of $2 9 5 \%$ .

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The FDA and CLSI recommended QC isolates, $E .$ . faecalis ATCC 29212 and S. aureus ATCC 29213 were with the reference method and the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System. Inoculum density was standardized by manual (CrystalSpec or BD PhoenixSpec) or automated (BD Phoenix AP) methods. The BD Phoenix™ was tested sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the system can produce acceptable range results $59 5 \%$ of the time by both inoculum preparation methods.

EA-Essential Agreement maj-major discrepancies CA-Category Agreement vmj-very major discrepancies R-resistant isolates min- minor discrepancies

Essential agreement (EA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panels agree with the reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panel result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation. Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the BD Phoenix™ and the reference and have on-scale EA.

There were a total of two very major discrepancies ( $1 . 6 \%$ discrepancy rate).

However, the acceptable number of discrepancy for 125 resistant isolates is three and the two vmj discrepancies were within the acceptable limit.

The performance of the BD Phoenix AP was also evaluated in the challenge study:

E. faecalis: There were four major discrepancies with false resistance of $> 3 2 \mu \varrho / \mathrm { m L }$ ;   
the major error rate was within the acceptable rate of $3 \%$ , at $1 . 6 \%$ (4/256).

E. faecium and other Enterococcus spp.: There were $3 0 4 E .$ . faecium, five other Enterococcus spp. isolates of $> 3 2 \mu \varrho / \mathrm { m L }$ and one $3 2 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ for $E .$ . faecium. No major or very major discrepancies were observed. The performance data met the acceptance criteria.

Staphylococcus aureus: There were ten vancomycin resistant $S .$ aureus (VRSA) tested in the validation study, resulting in no very major discrepancies or major discrepancies. However, there were five minor discrepancies at the breakpoint (BP) of $4 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ for vancomycin intermediate (VI); the Phoenix result was one dilution lower at $2 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ (susceptible) $2 7 . 8 \%$ (5/18) of the time. The following was included in the Expert triggered rule when reporting vancomycin of $2 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ for $S .$ . aureus:

“Vancomycin intermediate isolates of S. aureus (VISA) with a reference method MIC value of $4 \mathrm { m c g / m L }$ may be reported as having an MIC of $2 \mathrm { m c g / m L }$ . S. aureus isolates with an MIC of $2 \mathrm { m c g / m L }$ (susceptible) should have susceptibility confirmed using a non-automated MIC method or by submission of the isolate to a reference laboratory as appropriate.”

The results for $S .$ . epidermidis and coagulase-negative Staphylococci were acceptable.
