Device Trade Name:

QuickVue® Influenza test

Common Name:

Influenza immunological test

Predicate Devices:

QuickVue Influenza test

Device Classification/Name:

21 CFR 866.3330 / Influenza virus serological reagents

These tests are used to aid in the diagnosis of influenza and provide epidemiological information on influenza (21 CFR 866.3330). The Food and Drug Administration has classified serological test systems for the detection of influenza virus as Class I.

# Intended Use:

The QuickVue Influenza Test allows for the rapid, qualitative detection of influenza type A and type B antigens directly from nasal swab, nasal aspirate, and nasal wash specimens. The test is intended for use as an aid in the rapid diagnosis of acute influenza virus infection. The test is not intended to detect influenza C antigens. Negative test results should be confirmed by cell culture; they do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other management decisions. The test is intended for professional and laboratory use.

# Physiologic Basis of the Test:

Influenza viruses are causative agents of highly contagious, acute, viral infections of the respiratory tract.

Influenza viruses are immunologically diverse, single-stranded RNA viruses. There are three types of influenza viruses: A, B, and C. Type A viruses are the most prevalent and are associated with most serious epidemics. Type B viruses produce a disease that is generally milder than that caused by type A. Type C viruses have never been associated with a large epidemic of human disease. Both Type A and B viruses can circulate simultaneously, but usually one type is dominant during a given season.

Every year in the United States, on average $5 \%$ to $20 \%$ of the population contract influenza; more than 200,000 people are hospitalized from influenza complications; and, about 36,000 people die from influenza-related causes. Some people, such as older people, young children, and people with certain health conditions, are at high risk for serious influenza complications.

# Device Description:

The QuickVue Influenza Test involves the extraction of influenza A and B viral antigens. The patient specimen is placed in the Extraction Reagent Tube, during which time the virus particles in the specimen are disrupted, exposing internal viral nucleoproteins. After extraction, the Test Strip is placed in the Extraction Reagent Tube where nucleoproteins in the specimen will react with the reagents in the Test Strip.

If the extracted specimen contains influenza antigens, a pink-to-red Test Line along with a blue procedural Control Line will appear on the Test Strip indicating a positive result. If influenza type A or type B antigens are not present, or are present at very low ievels, only a blue procedural Control Line will appear.

# Summary of Performance Data:

An analytical study was performed to assess the ability of the QuickVue Influenza test to detect the influenza A virus H7N9 (A/Anhui/1/2013) and establish the Limit of Detection.

# Conclusion:

The results of this study show that QuickVue Influenza test detects H7N9 with a minimum detectable level of $1 . 9 8 \times 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ Egg Infective Dose $( E | D ) _ { 5 0 } / m L$ . The QuickVue Influenza test is substantially equivalent with the current QuickVue Influenza test.
