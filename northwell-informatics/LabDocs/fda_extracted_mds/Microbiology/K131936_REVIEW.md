# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) Tularemia Detection Kit is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test kit intended for the qualitative in vitro diagnostic (IVD) detection of target DNA sequences of Francisella tularensis. The system can be used to test human whole blood collected in sodium citrate or sputum collected aseptically from individuals greater than 18 years of age suspected of having tularemia. In addition, positive blood cultures and colonies may be tested. This assay is intended to aid in the diagnosis of individual presenting with signs and symptoms of pneumonic or typhoidal tularemia. It is not intended to aid in the diagnosis of glandular, ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, or oropharyngeal tularemia.

The JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit is run on the JBAIDS instrument using the Diagnostic Wizard. Results are for the presumptive identification of $F$ . tularensis in conjunction with culture and other laboratory tests. The definitive identification of $F .$ . tularensis from colony growth, liquid blood culture growth, blood specimens, or sputum specimens requires additional testing and confirmation procedures in consultation with public health or other authorities for whom reports are required.

The diagnosis of tularemia must be made based on history, signs, symptoms, exposure likelihood, and other laboratory evidence in addition to the identification of the target either from colonies, blood culture, whole blood or sputum specimens.

The JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit is intended for use by trained clinical laboratory personnel who have received specific training on the use of the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit. The level of $F .$ . tularensis that would be present in blood or sputum from individuals with early systemic or pneumonic infection is unknown. Due to the difficulty in obtaining clinical specimens, this assay was not evaluated with blood or sputum from individuals presenting with signs and symptoms of tularemia who have subsequently developed pneumonic or typhoidal tularemia pneumonic or typhoidal tularemia.

The level of $F .$ . tularensis that would be present in blood or sputum of individuals with early systemic or pneumonic infection is unknown. Due to the difficulty in obtaining clinical specimens, the assay was not evaluated with blood or sputum from individuals presenting with signs and symptoms of tularemia and who subsequently developed pneumonic or typhoidal tularemia.

4. Special instrument requirements: JBAIDS instrument

# I. Device Description:

Note: The JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit (K072547) was developed by Idaho Technology earlier. Now it is produced by BioFire Diagnostics.

The JBAIDS Tularemia Detection System is composed of the portable JBAIDS instrument, laptop computer and software, and the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit, which includes specific freeze-dried reagents for the detection of a gene target of the $F$ . tularensis. The JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit is specially designed for performing real-time PCR in glass capillaries using the JBAIDS instrument and JBAIDS software. The JBAIDS Tularemia Detection System was fully described earlier, please refer to FDA cleared 510(k) submission: K072547.

The JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit (K072547) was previously cleared for use with three different sample purification kits i.e., IT 1-2-3 QFLOWdna for whole blood, IT 1-2-3 VIBE for sputum, and IT 1-2-3 SWIPE for direct culture from blood agar Plate and positive blood culture media.

The purpose of this 510(k) submission was to add the IT $I { - } 2 { - } 3 ^ { \mathbf { T M } }$ Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit as the sample purification kit for use with the previously cleared JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit. The IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit uses magnetic bead technology to isolate nucleic acids, and the kit has been optimized for extraction of nucleic acids from a wide variety of sample types. The IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit can replace all of the other sample purification kits used in the JBAIDS program. The purpose of addition of IT ${ \cal I } { - } 2 { - } 3 ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit was to reduce and simplify the supplies and reagents to use the system in military arenas.

The JBAIDS Tularemia Detection System has now been validated using four different sample preparation kits for isolating DNA from whole blood, sputum, direct culture from blood agar Plate and positive blood culture media. The table below shows the comparison of four IT 1-2-3 Sample Purification Kits Validated for use with the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit.

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The reproducibility of JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit in conjunction with the Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit was evaluated by testing a panel of whole blood and sputum samples described below.

The evaluation with whole blood samples was conducted by testing one panel of twelve pooled human whole blood samples twice each day for four days at each of three testing sites. Spiking was performed at levels relative to the newly established LoD of 1500 $\mathrm { C F U / m L }$ . Specifically, the panel contained four samples spiked with inactivated $F .$ . tularensis at a medium positive $( 5 { \times } \mathrm { L o D } )$ ) level, four samples spiked at a low positive level $( 1 \times \mathrm { L o D } )$ , and four samples that were not spiked. The samples were prepared at BioFire Diagnostics, aliquoted and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for testing at BioFire Diagnostics or shipped overnight on ice for external site testing.

The evaluation with sputum samples was conducted by testing one panel of nine pooled residual sputum samples twice each day for five days at each of three testing sites. The panel contained three samples spiked with inactivated $F .$ . tularensis at a medium positive $( 5 { \times } \mathrm { L o D } )$ level, three samples spiked at a low positive level $\left( 1 \times \mathbf { L o D } \right)$ , and three samples that were not spiked. The samples were prepared at BioFire Diagnostics, aliquoted and stored frozen $( \leq 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for testing at BioFire Diagnostics or shipped frozen on dry ice for external site testing.

On each testing day, two users at each site purified and tested one aliquot of each sample in the panel under evaluation. A total of 96 whole blood sample replicates and 90 sputum sample replicates tested at each analyte level. All samples were processed with the IT $I$ - 2-3 Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit.

Overall for whole blood and sputum testing, system variability as measured by the coefficient of variation $( \% \mathrm { C V } )$ was $2 \div 4 \%$ for samples spiked at the medium positive $( 5 \times$ LoD) level, and $5 \text{‰}$ for samples spiked at the low positive (LoD) level across test sites.

The results of the reproducibility evaluation indicate that the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection System is reproducible when used in conjunction with the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit for human whole blood and sputum samples. The performance of the system is not significantly affected by the variability associated with different samples, operators, instruments, and test sites. The reproducibility results for whole blood and sputum samples are acceptable and presented below in the tables.

# d. Detection limits:

The Limit of Detection (LoD) for the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit was determined with the newer IT ${ \cal I } { - } 2 { - } 3 ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit for whole blood and sputum samples. The LoD testing was performed in two phases using live $F .$ . tularensis as described below.

Part I: Comparison of Sample Purification Kits

Initial estimates for the LoD were performed by spiking whole or sputum specimens with a serial dilution of live $F .$ . tularensis at 10x, 1x, and $0 . 1 \mathbf { x }$ the previously established LoD $( 3 0 0 \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ for whole blood, 2000 CFU/mL for sputum). The samples were then split and purified in parallel using both purification methods i. e., Whole blood purified with IT 1-2-3TM Platinum Path or IT 1-2-3TM QFLOWDNA Sample Purification Kits or

Sputum purified with IT 1-2-3TM Platinum Path or IT 1-2-3TM VIBE Sample Purification Kits.

Part II: Confirmation of the Platinum Path Sample LoDs

The LoD of the whole blood and sputum for the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit was further confirmed by purifying 20 individually prepared whole blood spiked samples and 20 individually prepared sputum spiked samples with $F .$ . tularensis, followed by purification only with the Platinum Path kit.

Initial direct comparison between the QFLOWDNA and Platinum Path whole blood purification methods showed the similar LoD of $3 0 0 \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ but it was not confirmed in all 20 individually prepared whole blood spiked samples (detection was 8/20 or $40 \%$ ). To reset the LoD for whole blood purified with the Platinum Path kit, a refinement dilution series at the 50x, 5x, and $0 . 5 \mathrm { x }$ LoD levels was tested and confirmed. The LoD for whole blood samples purified with the Platinum Path Sample purification kit was confirmed at 1500 CFU/mL.

There was no difference in the LoD of the sputum specimens using the QFLOWDNA and Platinum Path sputum purification methods. The original LoD for sputum samples was confirmed (detection was 19/20 or $9 5 \%$ ) at $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ with the Platinum Path kit.

Additional Studies: Detection of Direct Culture Samples Processed with the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit

The JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit was evaluated to detect and identify $F .$ . tularensis from direct culture samples (colonies) processed using a modified IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit protocol. The direct culture sample processing procedure and reagents are identical for the modified Platinum Path and the previously validated SWIPE protocol [that was previously FDA-cleared for use with the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit (K072547)], except that intermediate reagent volumes vary. The modified Platinum Path protocol for processing direct culture samples was designed to deliver the same amount of PCR template to a reaction as the SWIPE protocol. For both kits, the colony is processed by mechanical lysis followed by dilution in an elution buffer.

This study was conducted using $F _ { \cdot }$ . tularensis Schu4 strain colonies to demonstrate that the test system accurately detects $F .$ . tularensis. Colonies of $B$ . anthracis and Y. pestis were tested to demonstrate negative results. Each organism was grown on separate agar plates. Once colonies were at least $1 . 5 \mathrm { m m }$ in diameter, 10 individual positive $F .$ . tularensis colonies and 10 individual non- $F .$ . tularensis colonies (five from the $B$ . anthracis cultures and five from the Y. pestis cultures) were processed using the Platinum Path “Direct testing of Bacterial Cultures Protocol” and tested with the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit. Since the number of colony forming units (CFU) typically sampled from a colony is exceedingly high, qualitative results were expected to be positive, with early Cp values.

All samples containing $F .$ . tularensis yielded positive results, and no $F$ . tularensis was detected in any of the negative control samples (of $B$ . anthracis or Y. pestis). The Target Cp values for the $F .$ . tularensis colonies were fifteen cycles earlier than Cp values for whole blood samples spiked at the LoD and purified by Platinum Path.

The JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit assay is capable of detecting and identifying $F$ . tularensis from direct culture samples processed using a modified IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit. Results for the testing of ten $F .$ . tularensis colonies and ten non$F .$ . tularensis colonies are shown in the table below.

# Clinical Testing

Two clinical evaluations were performed to validate the use of the IT ${ \cal I } { - } 2 { - } 3 ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit to process clinical specimens with the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit. True clinical specimens from patients infected with Francisella tularensis (tularemia), are not available for testing due to the extreme rarity of natural infection with this organism. Therefore, two clinical evaluations using surrogate specimens were performed to validate the use of the IT ${ \cal I } { - } 2 { - } 3 ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit with the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit.

The first clinical valuation used prospectively collected whole blood specimens collected in sodium citrate and obtained from patients with febrile illness. The second clinical evaluation used residual frozen sputum specimens that were spiked with inactivated $F _ { \cdot }$ . tularensis. In both evaluations, the spiked samples were purified in parallel using the new and old extraction methods, and then tested with the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit.

# Testing of Surrogate Whole Blood Clinical Specimens

One hundred (100) surrogate whole blood specimens were prepared using prospectively collected specimens that were collected from febrile volunteers from November of 2012 into April of 2013. Fifty (50) of the specimens were spiked with inactivated $F .$ . tularensis at concentrations near and above the system LoD, while the remaining 50 specimens were not spiked with $F .$ . tularensis. The level of inactivated $F .$ . tularensis used to spike these samples was relative to the LoD (1500 CFU/mL) established for Platinum Pathpurified whole blood specimens.

Once spiked, samples were then processed using both the new nucleic acid extraction method (Platinum Path) and the original nucleic acid extraction method (IT 1-2-3™ QFLOWDNA Sample Purification Kit; QFLOWDNA) followed by testing with the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit. JBAIDS operators were blinded to the analyte content of the samples. The results obtained with the Platinum Path processed samples were compared to the results obtained with the QFLOWDNA processed samples.

The JBAIDS result for a sample purified using from the QFLOWDNA Kit was considered the correct result. The mean Cp values decrease as the analyte concentrations increase. The table below provides the JBAIDS Tularemia test results and Cp values stratified by $F .$ . tularensis spike level.

The final JBAIDS Tularemia interpretation for samples purified using the Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit had a positive percent agreement (PPA) of $100 \%$ as compared to samples purified using the QFLOWDNA kit (50/50; $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I } = 9 2 . 9 \ – 1 0 0 \% )$ . The final JBAIDS Tularemia interpretation for samples purified using Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit was negative for 50 out of 50 samples that were negative when purified using QFLOWDNA. This represents a negative percent agreement (NPA) of $100 \%$ (50/50; $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I } = 9 2 . 9 \ – 1 0 0 \% )$ . Using samples spiked near the LoD for samples purified with the Platinum Path kit $( 1 5 0 0 \mathrm { C F U / m L } )$ , the IT 1-2-3 QFLOWDNA and Platinum Path Sample Purification Kits performed equivalently with respect to detection of $F .$ . tularensis in surrogate whole blood specimens tested with the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit. The table below presents the Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) and Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) for the surrogate whole blood specimen testing.

a Samples were spiked with inactivated organism at concentrations that were adjusted to match the PCR performance of live organism. The initial estimated inactivated organism equivalent was shown to be too low when tested with high numbers of replicate samples spiked with inactivated organism at the $1 \times \mathrm { L o D }$ level. Therefore the inactivated organism equivalent at the $1 \times$ LoD level was renormalized to match the performance of live organism.

Samples were then processed using both the new nucleic acid extraction method (Platinum Path) and the original nucleic acid extraction method (IT ${ \cal I } { - } 2 { - } 3 ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ VIBE Sample Purification Kit) followed by testing with the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit. JBAIDS operators were blinded to the analyte content of the samples. The results obtained with the Platinum Path processed samples were compared to the results obtained with the VIBE processed samples.

The JBAIDS result for a sample purified using from the VIBE kit was considered the correct result. The mean Cp values decrease as the analyte concentrations increase. There were two false positive Tularemia results obtained during testing. One unspiked sample had a false positive test result when purified with the Platinum Path kit. The other false positive test result was for a Platinum Path purified sample spiked at the $1 \times \mathrm { L o D }$ level. This sample tested negative when processed with the VIBE kit (for which results are considered “truth”), so the final interpretation for the sample was “negative” despite the sample actually having been spiked with $F .$ . tularensis at the $1 \times \mathrm { L o D }$ level. When a sample is spiked at the $1 { \times } \mathrm { L o D }$ level, $\ge 9 5 \%$ of results are expected to be positive. Occasional negative results are therefore not unexpected (approximately 1 out of 20), with the consequence in this case of a false positive comparative result for a specimen spiked at the $1 { \times } \mathrm { L o D }$ level. The table below provides the JBAIDS Tularemia test results and $\mathrm { C p }$ values stratified by $F .$ . tularensis spike level.
