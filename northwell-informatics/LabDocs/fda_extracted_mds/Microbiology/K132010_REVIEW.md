# L. Test Principle:

The VIDAS $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ C. difficile GDH assay principle combines a two-step enzyme immunoassay sandwich method with a final fluorescent detection (ELFA).

The SPR serves as the solid phase as well as the pipetting device. Reagents for the assay are ready-to-use and are pre-dispensed in the sealed reagent strips. All of the assay steps are performed automatically by the instrument. The reaction medium is cycled in and out of the SPR several times. Each step is followed by a wash cycle which eliminates unbound components.

Specific binding of GDH present in the sample with mouse monoclonal anti-GDH antibody coated on the interior of the SPR.   
Binding between GDH and mouse monoclonal anti-GDH antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (ALP).   
Detection: alkaline phosphatase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the substrate (4-Methylumbelliferyl phosphate) into a fluorescent product (4-Methyl-umbelliferone) the fluorescence of which is measured at $4 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .

The intensity of the fluorescence increases according to the quantity of GDH in the sample.

When the VIDAS C. difficile GDH test is completed, the results are analyzed automatically by the instrument, a test value is generated, and a result is printed for each sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The within-laboratory precision was estimated at one site based on the recommendations of the CLSI EP5-A2. Three human samples, including two close to the clinical cut-off (one high negative and one low positive), were tested in triplicate in two runs per day with two different operators, with two reagent lots for a total of 12 testing days (six days of test per lot) on one VIDAS instrument $\mathrm { N } { = } 7 2$ test values for each sample). Two calibrations were used for each reagent lot (three days of test per calibration and lot) over the whole period of the study. Data from the study are summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Sample</td><td rowspan="2">N</td><td rowspan="2">Mean test value</td><td colspan="2">Repeatability</td><td colspan="2">Total within-laboratory precision (total within- instrument, between-lot, between-calibration)</td></tr><tr><td>Standard deviation</td><td>CV (%)</td><td>Standard deviation</td><td>CV (%)</td></tr><tr><td>Sample 1 High negative</td><td>72</td><td>0.07</td><td>0.00</td><td>6.0</td><td>0.01</td><td>14.1</td></tr><tr><td>Sample 2 Low positive</td><td>72</td><td>0.12</td><td>0.01</td><td>5.2</td><td>0.01</td><td>11.9</td></tr><tr><td>Sample 3 Moderate positive</td><td>72</td><td>0.27</td><td>0.02</td><td>5.7</td><td>0.03</td><td>11.2</td></tr></table>

The within-laboratory precision of each panel member was also analyzed by determining the percentage of agreement between the test interpretation and the expected outcome (negative/positive interpretation). There was no change of interpretation for the 3 panel samples tested: all replicates of each panel member resulted in the expected interpretation. Data from the qualitative analysis are summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Sample</td><td rowspan="2">Expected Result</td><td rowspan="2">N</td><td colspan="2">Observed result Lot 1</td><td colspan="2">Observed result Lot 2</td><td colspan="2"></td></tr><tr><td>Neg</td><td>Pos</td><td>Neg</td><td>Pos</td><td>Total Agreement</td><td>[CI95] %</td></tr><tr><td>Sample 1 High negative</td><td>Negative</td><td>72</td><td>36</td><td>0</td><td>36</td><td>0</td><td>72/72 (100.0%)</td><td>[95.0 - 100.0]%</td></tr><tr><td>Sample 2 Low positive</td><td>Positive</td><td>72</td><td>0</td><td>36</td><td>0</td><td>36</td><td>72/72 (100.0%)</td><td>[95.0 - 100.0]%</td></tr><tr><td>Sample 3 Moderate positive</td><td>Positive</td><td>72</td><td>0</td><td>36</td><td>0</td><td>36</td><td>72/72 (100.0%)</td><td>[95.0 - 100.0]%</td></tr></table>

The reproducibility was estimated at three sites based on the recommendations of the CLSI EP5-A2. Three human samples, including two close to the clinical cut-off (one high negative and one low positive), were tested in triplicate in two runs per day with two different operators, using two reagent lots for a total of six testing days (three days of test for each lot) on three VIDAS instruments at three different sites $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { N } = 1 0 8$ test values for each sample). One calibration was used for each reagent lot over the whole period of the study. Data from the study are summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Sample</td><td rowspan="2">N</td><td rowspan="2">Mean test value</td><td colspan="2">Reproducibility (total between sample preparation/operator/run/day/lot/</td></tr><tr><td>instrument) Standard deviation</td><td>CV (%)</td></tr><tr><td>Sample 1 High negative</td><td>108</td><td>0.06</td><td>0.01</td><td>19.1</td></tr><tr><td>Sample 2 Low positive</td><td>108</td><td>0.12</td><td>0.02</td><td>12.9</td></tr><tr><td>Sample 3 Moderate positive</td><td>108</td><td>0.26</td><td>0.03</td><td>13.0</td></tr></table>

The reproducibility of each panel member was also analyzed by determining the percentage of agreement between the test interpretation and the expected outcome (negative/positive interpretation). Data from the qualitative analysis for all sites combined are summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Panel Sample</td><td rowspan="2">Expected Result</td><td rowspan="2">N</td><td colspan="2">Observed result Site 1</td><td colspan="2">Observed result Site 2</td><td colspan="2">Observed result Site 3</td><td rowspan="2">Total Agreement</td><td rowspan="2">[CI95] %</td></tr><tr><td>Neg</td><td>Pos</td><td>Neg</td><td>Pos</td><td>Neg Pos</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sample 1 High negative</td><td>Negative</td><td>108</td><td>36</td><td>0</td><td>36</td><td>0</td><td>35</td><td>1</td><td>107/108 (99.1%)</td><td>[94.95 - 99.98]%</td></tr><tr><td>Sample 2 Low positive</td><td>Positive</td><td>108</td><td>0</td><td>36</td><td>1</td><td>35</td><td>3</td><td>33</td><td>104/108 (96.3%)</td><td>[90.79 - 98.98%</td></tr><tr><td>Sample 3 Moderate positive</td><td>Positive</td><td>108</td><td>0</td><td>36</td><td>0</td><td>36</td><td>0</td><td>36</td><td>108/108 (100%)</td><td>[96.64 - 100]7%</td></tr></table>

Out of the 108 results obtained for each precision sample, there were:

1 change of interpretation $( 0 . 9 \% )$ for the high negative sample (Sample 1),   
4 changes of interpretation $( 3 . 7 \% )$ for the low positive sample (Sample 2),   
0 change of interpretation $( 0 \% )$ for the moderate positive sample (Sample 3).

The percentages of change of interpretation observed for Sample 1 and Sample 2 were less than $5 \%$ , which was considered as normal and expected for these types of samples very close to the assay decision threshold (average test value for Sample $1 =$ 0.06 and average test value for Sample $2 = 0 . 1 2$ for a decision threshold at 0.10.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Controls:

One positive control (C1) and one negative control (C2) are included in each VIDAS C. difficile GDH kit. These controls must be performed each time a new lot of reagents is opened to ensure that reagent performance has not been altered. Each calibration must be checked using these controls. Results cannot be validated if the control values deviate from the expected values. The expected value range for each control is indicated on the Master Lot Entry (MLE) Card that is provided with the kit.

# Calibrators:

Calibration, using the standard (S1) provided in the kit, must be performed each time a new lot of reagents is opened, after the master lot data have been entered. Calibration should then be performed every 28 days. The standard value must be within the set RFV "Relative Fluorescence Value" range as indicated on the MLE card. If this is not the case, recalibrate.

# Sample stability:

Unpreserved stool specimens may be stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 3 days (from time of collection) prior to processing. If longer storage is required, freeze the specimens at - $7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } + / - 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ up to one month. Avoid repeated freezing and thawing cycles and storage at $- 1 9 / - 3 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Do not use containers which may contain detergents, preservatives or media that may interfere with the VIDAS C. difficile GDH assay results.

Samples stored in Cary Blair or C&S Transport media, or preserved $10 \%$ formalin, merthiolate formalin, sodium acetate formalin, or polyvinyl alcohol media have not been evaluated for use with the VIDAS C. Difficile GDH Assay.

Processed specimen supernatants, processed standard and reconstituted controls may be stored up to 8 hours at $1 8 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or 48 hours at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ before being tested with the VIDAS C. difficile GDH assay. Specimen supernatants and processed standard and control storage at $- 1 9 / - 3 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and - $- 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } + / \mathrm { - } 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ was not validated and is therefore not recommended.

# High dose hook effect:

No hook effect was observed up to purified native GDH antigen concentrations of $2 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of detection was evaluated using a range of dilutions of purified native C.difficile GDH C. difficile GDH in a pool of C. difficile-negative stool samples based on the recommendations of the CLSI EP17-A. The limit of detection of the VIDAS $C$ . difficile GDH assay (at least $9 5 \%$ detection rate for positive samples) is $3 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for purified native GDH antigen.

e. Analytical specificity:

Cross reactivity:

To test for cross-reactivity, each micro-organism was diluted in a pool of C. difficilenegative stool samples, pretreated and a single replicate was tested using the VIDAS C. difficile GDH assay. To test for microbial interference, each micro-organism was diluted in a pool of $C$ . difficile-positive stool samples, pretreated and a single replicate was tested using the VIDAS C. difficile GDH assay. The micro-organisms were tested at a concentration of $3 \mathrm { { x } 1 0 ^ { 8 } C F U / m L }$ (1 McFarland) for bacteria and $1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { P F U / m L }$ for viruses.

# N. Instrument Name:

The VIDAS and miniVIDAS instruments.

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

The VIDAS instrument (K891385) was cleared in 1989. The VIDAS instrument is attached to a computer and printer. Each instrument has five independent sections allowing five different assays to be run simultaneously. Each section can process up to six samples. Therefore, a fully loaded VIDAS can process thirty samples. A smaller compact version of the VIDAS instrument, appropriately called the miniVIDAS, was cleared under K923579 in 1993. The miniVIDAS instrument has a built-in computer, keyboard and printer. Two independent sections each accept six tests and can process up to twelve samples simultaneously. Each FDA cleared VIDAS assay can be run on either the VIDAS or the miniVIDAS instrument.

# 2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes X or No

3. Specimen Identification:

All assay steps are controlled automatically by the instrument. The sample is transferred into the wells. The STR strip consists of ten wells covered with labeled foil seal. The label comprises a bar code which indicates the assay code, kit lot number and expiration date.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The solid phase receptor (SPR) serves as both the solid phase and the pipetting device. The foil of the first well is perforated to allow introduction of the sample. The last well (well ten) of each strip is a cuvette in which the fluorometric reading is performed. The center wells of the strip contain the various reagents required for the assay.

5. Calibration:

The kit contains a GDH standard (S1), a positive control (C1) and a negative control (C2). Each calibration must be checked using these controls. Calibration should be performed with each new lot of reagents and then every 28 days.

6. Quality Control:

The kit contains a Master Lot Entry card (MLE) which contains specifications for the factory master data required to calibrate the test. Data from the MLE card is entered into the instrument before each new lot of reagents is used. Calibration provides instrumentspecific information and compensates for possible minor variations in assay signal throughout the shelf-life of the kit.
