# SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification Review Memorandum

To: Hologic, Inc. (Gen-Probe Prodesse, Inc.)

RE: K132200

This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own Class II devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:

1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device:

Prodesse® Pro hMPV $^ \mathsf { T M } +$ Assay 510(k) number: K123838

2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for use and package labeling.

3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S) to demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.

The 510k submission contained modifications to the Internal Control.   
a. Incorporation of a Universal Internal Control that contains a RNA in vitro transcript (IVT) and a DNA plasmid; The current Internal Control (RIC) in Pro hMPV $^ +$ Assay contains a RNA in vitro transcript (IVT). The new Universal Internal Control (UIC-A) will contain a RNA in vitro transcript (IVT) and a DNA plasmid to allow users to perform one nucleic acid extraction and test with any combination of the $\mathsf { P r o } \star$ Series Assays including ProFlu+, ProhMPV+, ProParaflu+, ProFAST $^ +$ , and ProAdeno+. The concentration of the RNA IVT in the Universal Internal Control (UIC-A) is the same as in the current Internal RNA Control (RIC). Handling of Universal Internal Control is identical to that of the current Internal RNA Control (RIC) included in the Pro hMPV $^ +$ Assay.   
b. Outsourcing of the manufacturing of the Internal Control and subsequent minor sequence changes. Due to the different vector being used in the Universal Internal Control (UIC-A), minor changes were made to the 5’ and 3’ ends of the UIC-A sequence.

4. Comparison Information (similarities and differences) to applicant’s legally marketed predicate device including, labeling, intended use, and physical characteristics.

# 5. A Design Control Activities Summary:

a. Identification of Risk Analysis method used to assess the impact of the modification on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis; FMEA was performed to determine whether the current design changes create new risks or failure modes or affect the risk priority number (RPN) value. No additional risk or change in RPN value was identified in the Risk Analysis.

b. To demonstrate that the modifications in Internal Control do not change the assay performance, Analytical Studies and a Comparison Study were conducted.

# Analytical Performances:

Analytical Sensitivity Confirmation   
LoD, which was established in K123838 in 2013, was confirmed for hMPV using one strain of virus when tested with the UIC-A control side by side with the current RIC control The LoD was confirmed to be at 1 $\times 1 0 ^ { 0 . 5 } \mathsf { T C l D 5 0 } / \mathsf { m L }$ .   
IC Interference Study   
The IC Interference Study demonstrated that the new control, UIC-A, did not inhibit the detection of target organisms at levels close to LoD.   
Sample Stability Study   
The study demonstrated that the stability of the samples would not be affected by a change in the internal control.   
Extractor Equivalency Studies   
The study for equivalency of nucleic acid extraction methods between the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG automated extractor and Roche MagNA Pure LC extractor demonstrated the equivalency between the two extraction methods.

# Comparison Study:

The comparison study was conducted for all $\mathsf { P r o } \star$ Series Assays including ProFlu+, Pro hMPV+, ProParaflu+, ProFAST $^ +$ , and ProAdeno $^ +$ using 366 positive samples and 66 negative samples. Among the 366 positive samples, 330 were retrospective pre-selected archived NPS specimens with 30 positive samples per target (11 targets total) and 36 were contrived samples, generated by spiking individual negative retrospective NPS samples with whole organism (Influenza A/Seasonal H1 or Parainfluenza 2). Each sample was split into 3 aliquots; one aliquot was tested using the current Internal RNA Control (RIC), one aliquot was tested using the Universal Internal Control (UIC-A), and one aliquot was tested using the current Universal Internal Control (UIA-P) for ProAdeno+ Assay. All samples were then split into 72 panels with 6 samples per panel, extracted and tested by four different operators. Half of the panel samples were extracted using the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG method and the other half using the Roche MagNA Pure LC method. Of the 432 samples utilized in the study, 19 samples were removed from analysis due to the invalid controls or incomplete test results. The results for the Pro hMPV+ Assay are summarized in the following table:

The results of analytical studies and the clinical study confirmed the original performance claims of the Pro hMPV $^ { \prime } +$ Assay and demonstrated that assay performance was not affected by the incorporation of the new Universal Internal Control (UIC-A). The Pro hMPV+ Assay package insert has been updated to reflect the changes in the internal control.

c. A declaration of conformity with design controls was submitted for the manufacturing facility which includes:

i) A statement signed by the Senior Director of R & D, Gen-Probe Prodesse, Inc., was submitted confirming that, as required by the risk analysis, all verification and validation activities were performed by the designated individual(s) and the results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance criteria were met, and   
ii) A “Declaration of Conformity” statement signed by the Associate Director of Quality and Regulatory, Gen-Probe Prodesse, Inc. was submitted stating that the manufacturing facility is in conformance with design control procedure requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and the records are available for review.

6. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary or Statement and the Indications for Use Enclosure.

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.
