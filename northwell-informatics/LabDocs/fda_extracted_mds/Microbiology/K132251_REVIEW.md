Establishing the Performance Characteristics of In Vitro Diagnostic Devices for Chlamydia trachomatis and/or Neisseria gonorrhea: Screening and Diagnostic Testing - Draft Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, May 11, 2011.

# L. Test Principle:

The APTIMA Combo 2 Assay involves the technologies of target capture, transcriptionmediated amplification (TMA), and dual kinetic assay (DKA).

Specimens are collected and transferred into their respective specimen transport tubes. The transport solutions in these tubes release the rRNA targets and protect them from degradation during storage. When the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay is performed in the laboratory, the target rRNA molecules are isolated from specimens by use of capture oligomers via target capture that utilizes magnetic microparticles. The capture oligomers contain sequences complementary to specific regions of the target molecules as well as a string of deoxyadenosine residues. A separate capture oligomer is used for each target. During the hybridization step, the sequence specific regions of the capture oligomers bind to specific regions of the target molecules. The capture oligomer:target complex is then captured out of solution by decreasing the temperature of the reaction to room temperature. This temperature reduction allows hybridization to occur between the deoxyadenosine region on the capture oligomer and the poly-deoxythymidine molecules that are covalently attached to the magnetic particles. The microparticles, including the captured target molecules bound to them, are pulled to the side of the reaction vessel using magnets and the supernatant is aspirated. The particles are washed to remove residual specimen matrix that may contain amplification reaction inhibitors. After the target capture steps are completed, the specimens are ready for amplification.

Target amplification assays are based on the ability of complementary oligonucleotide primers to specifically anneal and allow enzymatic amplification of the target nucleic acid strands. The APTIMA Combo 2 Assay replicates a specific region of the 23S rRNA from Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and a specific region of the 16S rRNA from Neisseria gonorrhea (GC) via DNA intermediates. A unique set of primers is used for each target molecule. Detection of the rRNA amplification product sequences (amplicon) is achieved using nucleic acid hybridization. Single-stranded chemiluminescent DNA probes, which are complementary to a region of each target amplicon, are labeled with different acridinium ester molecules. The labeled DNA probes combine with amplicon to form stable RNA:DNA hybrids. The Selection Reagent differentiates hybridized from unhybridized probe, eliminating the generation of signal from unhybridized probe. During the detection step, light emitted from the labeled RNA:DNA

hybrids is measured as photon signals in a luminometer, and are reported as Relative Light Units (RLU). In DKA, differences in the kinetic profiles of the CT and GC labeled probes allow for the differentiation of signal; kinetic profiles are derived from measurements of photon output during the detection read time. The chemiluminescent detection reaction for CT signal has very rapid kinetics and has the “flasher” kinetic type. The chemiluminescent detection reaction for GC signal is relatively slower and has the “glower” kinetic type. Assay results are determined by a cut-off based on the total RLU and the kinetic curve type.

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Within-Laboratory Repeatability:   
Within-laboratory repeatability was conducted previously to support the clearance of K111409. Please refer to decision summary of K111049. Reproducibility:   
Reproducibility of the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay on the PANTHER System was evaluated in two different studies using panel members created with Specimen Transport Medium in Reproducibility Study One and using panel members created with clinical urine specimens in Reproducibility Study Two. Reproducibility Study One   
APTIMA Combo 2 Assay reproducibility was evaluated with panel members created using Specimen Transport Medium at three external US laboratories using the PANTHER System. Testing was performed using one lot of assay reagents and a total of six operators (two at each site). Testing was performed over at least 10 days at each site. The negative panel member consisted of Specimen Transport Medium and positive panel members were created by spiking Specimen Transport Medium with lysate from CT and/or GC organisms to result in panel members with expected targeted concentrations. The table below shows the CT and GC concentrations for each panel member and the mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) of the RLU data for each panel member between-sites, betweenoperators, between-days, between-runs, within-runs, and overall. Percent agreement with expected results is also shown. Only samples with valid results were included in the analyses.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Freeze-Thaw Stability

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay on the PANTHER System using urine samples that were frozen and thawed prior to testing. Paired fresh (non-frozen) and frozen urine samples were evaluated. The urine specimens were diluted 1:1 with urine transport medium (UTM) and then split into two aliquots to generate negative and positive samples:

1. One aliquot was left un-spiked (negative sample). 2. One aliquot was spiked with $0 . 2 5 \mathrm { \ I F U / m L }$ of cultured CT serovar E and 12.5 CFU/mL of cultured GC strain 49226 (CT/GC-positive sample).

The un-spiked and spiked urine samples were split into two aliquots to test fresh (non-frozen) and frozen sample storage conditions:

1. Fresh samples: One spiked and one un-spiked aliquot of each urine sample was stored at $2 ^ { \circ } C$ to $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ until tested.   
2. Frozen samples: One spiked and one un-spiked aliquot of each sample was frozen and stored at $\leq - 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for at least 72 hours (to ensure samples were completely frozen) until tested.

The results from this study demonstrate equivalency between urine samples tested fresh and paired samples tested after being frozen and thawed.

# Quality Control Results and Acceptability

The Positive Control, CT / Negative Control, GC and the Positive Control, GC / Negative Control, CT act as controls for the target capture, amplification, and detection steps of the assay. The Positive Control, CT / Negative Control, GC serves as the negative control for the GC test results. The Positive Control, GC / Negative Control, CT serves as the negative control for the CT test results. If desired, a dual negative control furnished by the user can be added to monitor assay background. Correct preparation of specimens is confirmed visually by the presence of a single APTIMA collection swab in a swab specimen transport tube or the absence of a swab in an APTIMA specimen transfer tube for PreservCyt liquid Pap specimens.

The APTIMA Combo 2 Assay Controls must produce the following test results:   

<table><tr><td>Control</td><td>Total RLU (x1000)</td><td>CT Result</td><td>GC Result</td></tr><tr><td>Positive Control, CT /Negative Control, GC</td><td>≥ 100 and &lt; 3,000</td><td>Positive</td><td>Negative</td></tr><tr><td>Positive Control, GC /Negative Control, CT</td><td>≥ 150 and &lt; 3,000</td><td>Negative</td><td>Positive</td></tr></table>

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Detection (LoD) study included a series of dilution panels of CT (serovars E and G) and GC (ATCC strain 49226 and 19424) prepared in urine and in specimen transport medium (STM) to achieve several test concentrations. The positivity, with the two-sided $9 5 \%$ Score confidence interval, was calculated for each test concentration of each panel. Probit analysis was performed on the positivity results of each panel to determine the predicted $9 5 \%$ detection limit. The LoDs in both STM and urine sample matrices are well below the assay sensitivity claims for CT (1 IFU/assay) and GC (50 cells/assay).

The LoD of the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay on the PANTHER system in both urine and STM sample matrices was verified for 12 serovars of CT and 30 strains of GC. Dilutions of less than $2 . 5 \mathrm { \ I F U / m L }$ tested positive in the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay for the following 12 serovars: D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L1, L2, L2a, and L3 $( \geq 9 5 \%$ positivity was observed in samples containing CT concentrations of $1 . 8 9 \mathrm { I F U / m L }$ ). Dilutions of less than $1 2 5 \ : \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ tested positive in the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay for 30 different strains of GC $( { \geq } 9 5 \%$ positivity was observed in samples containing GC concentrations of 0.36 cells/mL).

g. Carryover Study:

The purpose of this study was to determine the carryover rate of the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay on the PANTHER System when high titer positive samples were alternately processed with negative samples in a checkerboard format. Six runs were performed on one PANTHER instrument using one reagent lot for three days. The first run comprised of 135 negative samples was performed to establish the baseline false positive rate. The five subsequent runs were comprised of 54 samples (GC-positive and GC-negative samples) alternated in checkerboard format. High titer positive samples for this study were made by spiking GC rRNA into specimen transport media (STM) to give a final concentration equivalent to $\sim 2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ cells/mL. The false positive rate from the baseline run without any positive samples (Run 1) was $0 \%$ (0/135; $100 \%$ specificity). The false positive rate from the runs with positive samples in the checkerboard design (Runs 2-6) was $0 . 7 4 \%$ (1/135; $9 9 . 2 6 \%$ specificity). The carryover rate was $0 . 7 4 \%$ with a $9 5 \%$ CI of -2.03 to 4.10.

h. Assay cut-off:

Assay test results are automatically interpreted by the APTIMA Assay software, using the APTIMA Combo 2 protocol. A test result may be a negative, equivocal, positive, or invalid as determined by the kinetic type and total RLU in the detection step. A test result may be invalid due to a parameter outside the normal expected ranges. Initial equivocal and invalid test results should be retested.

3. Clinical studies:

Two clinical studies were performed. APTIMA Combo 2 Assay clinical performance was estimated with male urethral swab, vaginal swab, PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap, and endocervical swab specimens in Clinical Study One, and with male urine specimens in Clinical Study Two.

# Clinical Study One: Vaginal Swab, PreservCyt Solution Liquid Pap, Female Endocervical Swab, and Male Urethral Swab Specimen Clinical Study

A prospective, multi-center clinical study was conducted to establish the performance characteristics of the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay on the PANTHER System. Specimens were collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic men $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n } = 5 8 0 )$ ) and women $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 3 3 2 )$ enrolled from seven geographically and ethnically diverse US clinical sites, including obstetrics and gynecology, family planning, public health, and STD clinics. Subjects were classified as symptomatic if symptoms were reported by the subject. Subjects were classified as asymptomatic if the subject did not report symptoms. Of the 580 male subjects, none were ${ < } 1 8$ years of age, 72 were 18 to 20 years of age, 201 were 21 to 25 years of age, and 307 were ${ > } 2 5$ years of age. Of the 1332 female subjects, 11 were 14 to 15 years of age, 59 were 16 to 17 years of age, 319 were 18 to 20 years of age, 401 were 21 to 25 years of age, and 542 were ${ > } 2 5$ years of age.

Up to two specimens were collected from each male subject (one urethral swab and one first-catch urine, in that order) and up to four specimens were collected from each female subject (one first-catch urine, one vaginal swab, one PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap specimen, and one endocervical swab, in that order). All specimens were cliniciancollected except urine specimens and approximately half of the vaginal swab specimens, which were collected by the subject at the clinic. Approximately half of the PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap specimens were collected with a broom-type device and half were collected with a spatula and cytobrush. Samples were prepared for APTIMA testing in accordance with the appropriate APTIMA specimen collection kit package insert instructions.

All evaluable samples (567 male urethral swab, 580 male urine, 1319 vaginal swab, 1330 PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap, and 1310 endocervical swab samples) were tested with the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay on the PANTHER System in accordance with package insert instructions. The samples were split among three laboratories (two external laboratories and in-house). Samples with initial invalid, equivocal, or error results were retested. Eighteen (18) male urethral swab, 25 vaginal swab, one PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap, and 37 endocervical swab samples had final invalid results and were excluded from the analyses. Most of the invalid results were due to insufficient sample volume. One vaginal swab, and one endocervical swab had final CT equivocal results and one PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap sample, and one endocervical swab had final GC equivocal results and were excluded from the analyses.

Male urethral swab, male and female urine, and PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap samples were tested with cleared nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) to establish the infected status. The infected status algorithm used results from two specimen types and two reference NAATs. Subjects were categorized as infected if a positive result occurred in each of the two reference NAATs (see Tables 8, 9, 11, and 12 for the infected status algorithms). For female subjects, if the positive NAAT results occurred only in the urine specimens and not in the PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap specimens, the subject was categorized as infected; however, for the evaluation of the non-urine specimen types, the specimens were considered non-infected. Subjects that could not be categorized as infected or not infected were excluded from the performance analyses.

In addition, male urine samples tested with the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay on the PANTHER System were excluded from the performance analyses due to the low prevalence of GC in the study population, particularly in the asymptomatic subjects.

# Clinical Study Two: Male Urine Specimen Clinical Study

A prospective, multi-center clinical study was conducted to establish the performance characteristics of the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay on the PANTHER System in male urine specimens. Specimens were collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic men $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 4 9 2 )$ enrolled from 13 geographically and ethnically diverse US clinical research sites, and family planning, public health, men’s health, and STD clinics. Subjects were classified as symptomatic if symptoms were reported by the subject. Subjects were classified as asymptomatic if the subject did not report symptoms. Of the 1492 subjects enrolled, 14 were withdrawn.

Two specimens were collected from each subject (one urethral swab and one first-catch urine, in that order). The urethral swab specimens were clinician-collected, and urine specimens were collected by the subject at the clinic. Urine specimens from each subject were processed into multiple samples for CT/GC testing with different NAATs in accordance with the instructions in the appropriate specimen collection kit package insert. The male urine samples for APTIMA Combo 2 Assay testing on the PANTHER System were split among three external laboratories.

All 1478 male urine samples from non-withdrawn subjects were tested with the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay on the PANTHER System in accordance with the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay package insert instructions. Samples with initial invalid, equivocal, or error results were retested. One male urine sample had a final invalid result and was excluded from the analyses. The invalid result was due to insufficient sample volume. Of the remaining 1477 evaluable male subjects, 46 were 16 to 17 years of age, 155 were 18 to 20 years of age, 524 were 21 to 30 years of age, 279 were 31 to 40 years of age, and 473 were ${ > } 4 0$ years of age.

Male urethral swab and urine samples were tested with cleared NAATs to establish the infected status (see Tables 10 and 13 for the infected status algorithms). The infected status algorithm used urethral swab and urine sample results from one reference CT and GC NAAT and urine sample results from two additional reference CT and GC NAATs to generate four reference results for each analyte. Subjects were categorized as infected if a positive result occurred in at least two of the reference NAATs. Subjects that could not be categorized as infected or not infected were excluded from the performance analyses; 1 subject had an indeterminate CT infected status and was excluded from the performance analyses for detection of CT.

# Chlamydia trachomatis Performance Results

Performance characteristics of the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay for CT detection were estimated for each specimen type and are displayed in Tables 4 and 5 combining data from the two clinical studies. Performance was calculated by comparing PANTHER System results to an infected status algorithm, which differed between the two clinical studies (see Tables 8 through 10 for the CT infected status algorithms). Table 4 shows the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay for CT detection and the prevalence of CT (based on the infected status) in each specimen type.
