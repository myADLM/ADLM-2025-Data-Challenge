# SPECIAL 510(k) Device Modification Decision Summary

To: BD Diagnostics RE: K132259

This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own Class II device requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable

1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device:

Trade Name: BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ POC kit

510(k) number: K111277

2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for use, package labeling.

3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S). The modification presented in this 510(k) is the inclusion of the H7N9 influenza A virus strain below, to the analytical sensitivity information. The submitter tested the ability of the BD Veritor System Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ test to detect the H7N9 influenza A virus. The virus used (A/Anhui/1/2013) was inactivated viral material in clarified allontoic fluid from chicken eggs obtained from the WHO Collaborating Centre for Surveillance, Epidemiology and Control of Influenza, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Analytical sensitivity testing was done at10 fold dilutions from the stock received from CDC and was tested in triplicate using the BD Veritor System Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ test to establish the approximate level for the LOD:

· $7 . 9 4 \times 1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { C E } | \mathrm { D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ · $7 . 9 4 \times 1 0 ^ { 7 } \mathsf { C E } | \mathsf { D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathsf { m L }$ · 7.94 x 106 CEID50/mL· 3.97 x 106 CEID50/mL· 1.99 x 106 CEID50/mL· 7.94 x 105 CEID50/mL· 7.94 x 104 CEID50/mL$( C E | \mathsf { D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathsf { m L } = 5 0 \%$ Chicken Egg Infectious Dose)

A final dilution was prepared and tested in replicates of 60:

$$
5 . 4 2 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C E } | \mathrm { D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }
$$

The limit of detection of the BD Veritor System Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ test with A/Anhui/1/2013 H7N9 was 5.42 x $1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathsf { C E l D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathsf { m L }$ with a positivity of $9 8 . 3 \%$ (59/60).

The BD Veritor System Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ POC kit package insert has been updated to include the additional analytical sensitivity information.

4. The FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.

5. Comparison Information (similarities and differences) to applicant’s legally marketed predicate device including, labeling, intended use, and physical characteristics:

# Differences

The package insert has been updated to include detection of the following H7N9 virus in the analytical sensitivity information section and strain reactivity tables:

A/Anhui/1/2013 H7N9

And a disclaimer: “Although this test has been shown to detect the novel avian influenza A(H7N9) cultured virus, the performance characteristics of this device with clinical specimens that are positive for the novel avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have not been established. The BD Veritor System Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ test can distinguish between influenza A and B viruses, but it cannot differentiate influenza A subtypes.”

6. Design Control Activities Summary:

Analytical Sensitivity Testing was conducted as described in section 7, “Summary of Studies”.

Declaration of Conformity to Design Control   
A “Declaration of Conformity” statement was submitted for the manufacturing facility and validation activities and signed by the Director, Regulatory Affairs and Quality Systems. The statements indicate that;

1. The verification activities, as required by the risk analysis, for the modification were performed by the designated individual(s) and the results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance criteria were met. 2. The manufacturing facility, BD Rapid Diagnostics Co Ltd, is in conformance with the design control requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820. 30 and the records are available for review.

In conclusion, based on both the results of the analytical sensitivity testing and the risk management report, the modified labeling is truthful and accurate. The changes do not affect the performance of the test and it is therefore substantially equivalent to the current cleared test.

# 7. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary, and the Indications for Use Enclosure.

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular modification and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. On this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
