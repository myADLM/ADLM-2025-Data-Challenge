# 1. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The changes between the previously cleared cobas® CT/NG Test (K110923) and the currently submitted cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test are limited to the modification of the sample preparation workflow which requires a system software update related to the cobas® 4800 system. There are no changes for the reagents or the design between the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test and the cobas" CT/NG Test. The Roche Molecular Systems (RMS) cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test consists of six reagent kits:

cobas® 4800 System Sample Preparation Kit cobas® 4800 CT/NG v2.0 Amplification/Detection Kit cobas® 4800 CT/NG Controls Kit cobas® 4800 System Wash Buffer Kit cobas® 4800 System Control Diluent Kit cobas® 4800 System Liquid Cytology Preparation Kit

Sample Collection Kits to be used for the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test are:

cobas® PCR Female Swab Sample Kit cobas® PCR Urine Sample Kit PreservCyt (Hologic, Inc.)

The cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) is based on two major processes: (1) automated sample preparation to obtain nucleic acids. including CT and NG DNA: (2) simultaneous PCR amplification of target DNA sequences using both CT and NG specific complementary primer pairs and real-time detection of cleaved fluorescent-labeled CT and NG specific oligonucleotide detection probes. Internal control. containing CT and NG DNA, is added to all samples during automated sample preparation and is amplified and detected simultaneously with each sample to monitor the entire process.

The cobas® 4800 System utilizes the cobas $\mathbf { x } 4 8 0$ Instrument for automated sample preparation, and the cobas $\tt z 4 8 0$ Analyzer for automated amplification and detection. The cobas® 4800 system sofiware integrates the sample preparation with nucleic acid amplification and detection to generate test results.

# 2. INTENDED USE

The cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test is an automated, in vitro nucleic acid amplification test for the qualitative detection of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) DNA in urogenital specimens. The Test utilizes the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae DNA in male and female urinc, self-collected vaginal swab specimens (collected in a clinical setting), clinician-collected vaginal swab specimens, and endocervical swab specimens, all collected in cobas PCR Media (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.), and cervical specimens collected in PreservCyt $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ solution. This test is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of chlamydial and gonococcal disease in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.

The cobas® pCR Female Swab Sample Kit is used to collect and transport endocervical and vaginal swab specimens. The cobas® pCR Media serves as a nucleic acid stabilizing transport and storage medium for gynecological specimens. Use this collection kit only with either the cobas® CT/NG Test or the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test.

# 4. NON-CLINICAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

All performance related testing summarized in this report was performed using the cobas CT/NG $\mathrm { v } 2 . 0$ Test with the exception of the Analytical Specificity study (Section 4.3 below) which is based on the currently cleared cobas® CT/NG Test (K110923). The changes between the previously cleared cobas® CT/NG Test (K1 10923) and the currently submitted cobas™ CT/NG v2.0 Test are limited to the modification of the sample preparation workflow which requires a system software update related to the cobas® 4800 system. There are no changes for the reagents or the design between the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test and the cobas® CT/NG Test. Therefore it was concluded that data for the cobas® CT/NG Test can also be used to demonstral performance of the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test for Analytical Specificity.

# 4.1. Analytical Sensitivity

The analytical sensitivity (Limit of Detection or LOD) for the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test was determined by analyzing dilutions of quantified CT and NG cultures. Cultures of CT and NG were diluted into negative urine specimens stabilized in cobas® pCR Media, negative endocervical swab specimen in cobas® pCR Media, negative vaginal swab specimen in cobas PCR Media, and negative PreservCyt® specimen to determine the LOD for each specimen type. All levels for each spccimen type were analyzed using the full cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test workflow with 3 unique lots of cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test reagents. In the course of the stuy. a total of 5 unique lots of reagents were used. The LOD of the test is defined as the target concentration which can be detected as positive ir $\ge 9 5 \%$ of the replicates tested.

The LOD for the CT serovar D and serovar I cultures in urine specimens stabilized in cobas PCR Media, endocervical swab specimen in cobas® pCR Media, vaginal swab specimen in cobas® PCR Media, and PreservCyt® specimen are shown in Table 2. The LOD for NG strain 2948 (ATCC 19424) and strain 6693 in urine specimens stabilized in cobas® PCR Media, endocervical swab specimen in cobas® pCR Media, vaginal swab specimen in cobas® PCR Media, and negative PreservCy® specimen are shown in Table 3. When analyzed separately. male and female urine results were statistically equivalent for both CT and NG cultures.

# 4.2. Inclusivity

The sensitivity of the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test was determined for 13 additional CT scrovars, the Swedish variant CT strain (nvCT), and an additional 43 independently isolated strains of NG. Panels were prepared by spiking each CT culture stock into specimen type specific CT/NG negative pools to approximately 0.5 and 1.5 times the LOD of CT serovar D as deterinined in the LOD studies. Each NG culture was spiked into CT/NG negative pools to approximately 1.5 times the LOD of NG strain 2948 (ATCC 19424) as determined in the LOD studies. At least 20 replicates were tested for each CT and NG level. For any levels that did not produce a $9 5 \%$ or greater hit rate at the levels tested, a higher concentration was prepared and tested.

A total of $1 3 \mathbb { C T }$ serovars and one nvCT (Swedish variant) strain were evaluated. The minimum concentration from which all of the CT serovars returned a hit rate o $f \geq 9 5 \%$ was $6 0 ~ \mathrm { E B / m l }$ for urine stabilized in cobas PCR Media; 300 EB/mL for endocervical specimen in cobas PCR Media; 150 EB/mL for vaginal specimen in cobas PCR Media; and $1 0 0 . \mathrm { E B / m L }$ for cervical specimen collected in PreservCy1 Solution (Table 4).

A total of 43 strains of NG were evaluated. The minimum concentration from which all of the. NG strains returned a hit rate of $\geq 9 5 \%$ was 1 $C F U / \mathfrak { m L }$ for urine stabilized in cobas PCR Media; 10 CFU/mL for endocervical specimen in cobas PCR Media; 10 CFU/mL for vaginal specimen in cobas PCR Media; and $5 \mathrm { C F U / n } \mathrm { t }$ for cervical specimen collected in PreservCyt Solution (Table 5).

# 4.3. Analytical Specificity

A panel of 184 bacteria, fungi and viruses, including those commonly found in the female urogenital tract, as well as representatives of N. cineria, N. flava, N. lactamica, N. perflava and N. subflava and other phylogenetically unrelated organisms, were tested to assess analytical specificity. The organisms tested are listed in Table 6. All organisms were tested at concentrations of at least $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { U n i t s ^ { * } / m L }$ except those organisms listed in Table 7. All organisms were spiked into CT/NG negative cobas® PCR Media, pooled negative urine stabilized in cobas® pCR Media, pooled negative vaginal specimen in cobas $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PCR Media, and pooled negative PreservCyt® specimen spiked with CT and NG cultures at 3 times the limit of detection. Results indicated that none of these organisms interfered with detection of CT and NG or produced a false positive result in the CT/NG negative matrices.

# 4.4. Interference

Interference testing was performed using CT/NG negative urine specimen stabilized in cobas® PCR Media, endocervical swab specimen in cobas® pCR Media, vaginal swab specimen in cobas® PCR Media, and PreservCyt® specimen spiked with CT and NG cultures at $\sim 3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ }$ LOD for each target. Twenty-three over-the-counter (OTC) products and prescription medications, as well as whole blood, and PBMC cells were tested for interference. Additionally. cervical mucus was tested in swabs samples, and albumin, bilirubin, glucose, and pH were tested for interferencc in the urine specimen-type.

Of the 23 products tested, Metronidazole Vaginal Gel and Vagisil Satin produced invalid and/or false negative results in the urine panel samples. Replens® vaginal moisturizer produced invalid and/or false negative results in urine and endocervical swab panel samples. No interference from any of the other products was observed with the other sample matrices tested.

The levels of albumin, bilirubin, glucose, and pH shown in Table 8 and the levels of whole blood, mucus and PBMC cells shown in Table 9 represent maximum allowable concentrations which will not interfere with the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test performance.

# 4.5. Precision

Precision of the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test was examined in-house using a test panel composed of CT and NG cultures diluted into pools of CT and NG negative urine specimen stabilized in cobas® PCR Media, vaginal swab specimen in cobas® PCR Media, and PreservCy® specimen. The precision panel was designed to include negative samples as well as samples with CT and/or NG concentrations at and above the LOD of the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test. Additionally, samples with high CT or NG titers were examined for suppression of low titer target in the adjacent chanel. Testing was done with three unique lots of cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test reagents, tree instruments, over 12 days. A description of the precision panels is shown in Table 10 and the study performance in $\%$ hit rates is shown in Table I 1. All positive panel levels yielded the anticipated hit rates, with the exception of panel member 3 in urine which resulted in a hit rate of $8 3 \%$ . All negative panel levels tested negative throughout the study.

# 5. CLINICAL PERFORMANCE

The clinical performance characteristics of the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test were established in three multi-center clinical investigations conducted in the United States. One study evaluated the reproducibility at one internal and two external testing sites and two studies evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test on clinical specimens tested at 7 external testing sites.

One clinical investigation used archived endocervical specimens, self-collected and clinician collected vaginal specimens, endocervical specimens in PreservCyt Solution and male and female urine specimens, from symptomatic and asymptomatic males and females, collected during the clinical evaluation of the cobas® CT/NG Test (archived samples). A sccond investigation was performed using prospectively collected endocervical specimens, cliniciancollected vaginal specimens, female urine specimens, and cervical specimens in PreservCyt Solution from asymptomatic women (prospective fresh samples). Specimen collection for thesc studies took place at 18 collection sites in the US, which included family planning and Obstetrics/Gynecology (OB/GYN) clinics, and sexually transmitted disease clinics.

# 5.1. Reproducibility

ARepucbiliy Stuy was per across, testing ie, eraor, ru, and day r te cas CT/NG $\mathrm { v } 2 . 0$ Test for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) using 3 panels prepared from negative vaginal swabs collected in cobas" pCR Media, negative urine stabilized in cobas® pCR Media and negative cervical specimens collected in PreservCyt® Solution. The 5 panel members for each matrix type contained single target levels of CT and NG at 1 x LOD and $_ { 3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } }$ LOD plus one CT/NG negative level. Testing was performed at two external sites and one in-house site. A run for cobas PCR Media (urine and swab) included 3 replicates of each of 5 panel members and 1 positive and 1 negative control (32 total tests). A run for the PreservCyt $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Solution panel included 3 replicates of each of 5 panel members and 1 positive and 1 negative control (17 total tests). The 2 operators at each site performed 1 run per day each, for. a total of 5 days of testing per operator per panel type (10 days of testing total for each panel lype). Testing was performed with 1 reagent lot.

Overall, 127 runs were performed; 62 were for urine and swab panels (which wcre run together) and 65 were for PreservCyt panels. Sixty valid runs were obtained for each media type. Two failed runs occurred for the urine and swab panels, and 5 failed runs occurred for the PreservCyt panels. Failed runs were attributed to protocol deviations and instrument errors. A total of 900 tests were performed on the 5 panel members for each panel type. There was 1 invalid test result in the PreservCyt panel type, and 1 failed test result each in the swab, urine and PreservCyt panels. These failed tests were due to instrument errors.

All valid test results were included in the analyses of the percent agreement for CT and NG for each panel type separately. There were no false positive results for either analyte (CT and NG) for all panel types for negative panel members, thus giving negative percent agreement (NPA) of $100 \%$ for each analyte.

5.1.1. C. trachomatis (Table 12, Table 13, Table 14, and Table 15)

Table 12 below presents the total standard deviation (SD) and total percent coeflicient of variation $( C V [ \% ] )$ for each panel type, respectively. Across all panel types, the total CV $( \% )$ . ranged from $1 . 4 \%$ to $2 . 6 \%$ .

Percent agreement for the CT-positive panel members was $100 \%$ for 3 X LOD CT of all 3 panel types and also for the 1 X LOD CT of urine panel type. For the remaining 1 X LOD CT, percent agreement was $9 6 . 7 \%$ for swab and $9 8 . 9 \%$ for PreservCyt panel types. (Table 13 through Table 15.)

Table 16 below presents the total standard deviation (SD) and total percent coefficient of variation (CV $[ \% ] )$ for each panel type, respectively. Across all panel types, the total CV $( \% )$ ranged from $1 . 6 \%$ to $2 . 6 \%$ .

Percent agreement for the NG positive panel members was $9 9 . 4 \%$ for the 3 X LOD NG urinc panel and $100 \%$ for the $3 X$ LOD NG swab and PreservCyt panel types. ) For the 1 X LOD NG, percent agreement was $9 5 \%$ for the urine panel type, $8 9 . 4 \%$ for the swab panel type and $9 9 . 4 \%$ EPY for the PreservCyt panel type (Table 17 through Table 19).

There were no false positive results for NG negative panel members across all 3 panel types, thus yielding an analytical specificity of $100 \%$ for each panel type.

# 5.2. Clinical Specimen Study

# 5.2.1. Study Design

The clinical performance characteristics of the cobas® CT/G v2.0 Test were evaluated in two multi-center clinical studies conducted in the United States. One clinical investigation used archived endocervical specimens, self-coflected and clinician collected vaginal spccimens, endocervical specimens in PreservCyt Solution and male and female urine specimens, from symptomatic and asymptomatic males and females, collected during the clinical evaluation of the cobas® CT/NG Test (archived samples). A second investigation was performed using prospectively collected endocervical specimens, clinician-collected vaginal specimens, female urine specimens, and cervical specimens in PreservCyt Solution from asymptomatic women (prospective fresh samples). Specimen collection for these studies took place at 18 collection sites in the US, which included family planning and Obstetrics/Gynecology (OB/GYN) clinics, and sexually transmitted discase clinics.

At collection sites, each female subject provided a urine specimen, a self-collected or cliniciancollected vaginal swab specimen, a clinician-collected endocervical swab specimen, and a cervical specimen in PreservCyt $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ solution obtained with a spatula/cytobrush or a broom. For determination of Patient Infected Status (PIS) an aliquot of each urine, aliquots of each cervical specinen in PreservCyt solution, and an additional endocervical specimen, were collected in thc appropriate transport media for two commercially available nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT). For females, urine specimens were collected first. If a cervical cytology test was a scheduled part of the visit, that sample was taken next, followed by a vaginal and then endocervical swabs. If a cervical cytology test was not a scheduled part of the visit, a vaginal swab was taken next, followed by an endocervical swab and then the cervical specimen. Thc order of endocervical swab collection as well as clinician- or self-collection of the vaginal swabs was alternated to minimize collection bias.

Male subjects provided a urine specimen in cobas® PCR media and for the determination of PIS. urine and urethral swab specimens in collection media from two commercially available NAAT. For males, the urethral swabs were collected first in alternating order and then the urine specimen was collected.

# 5.2.2. Determination of Patient Infected Status

For each subject, a patient infected status (PIS) was determined based on the combined results from the reference assays. A subject was categorized as infected for CT or NG if a minimum of two positive results (at least one from each reference NAAT) was reported, as described in Table 20 and Table 22. For CT only, female subjects with positive results on both reference urine specimens and negative results on both reference endocervical swab specimens and the reference cervical sample were categorized as infected for urine and not infected for swab specimens. A subject was classified as non-infected if at least one of the reference NAATs reported negative ror ye.  pa  sa coul ot b e u i and/or indeterminate results from the reference tests, the subject was excluded from the analysis. PIS was determined for all evaluable subjects enrolled in the study.

# 5.2.3. Study Results

Results from the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test were compared with the PIS for calculation of test sensitivity and specificity. Of the 6,045 subjects enrolled (5,306 females and 739 males), 10 were excluded from the analyses because they did not meet study entry criteria or because they withdrew consent; 31 were considered non-evaluable and were excluded from all statistical analyses because of errors in specimen collection, transport, and storage; unknown PIS for both CT and NG; or invalid cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test results after initial testing and/or retesing. Therefore, of 6,035 eligible subjects enrolled, 6,004 $( 9 9 . 5 \% )$ were evaluable for CT and/or NG primary analyses (5,266 females and 738 males).

Results obtained from 1,01 1 prospective female asymptomatic subjects were analyzed combined with results obtained in the re-testing of all available samples (archived specimens) collected in the previous clinical study (4,255 females and 738 males).

In the clinical study, there was 1/385 $( 0 . 3 \% )$ invalid runs and 15/385 $( 3 . 9 \% )$ failed runs due to instrument error. Of the 26,283 specimens tested with the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test, $0 . 2 8 \%$ and $0 . 2 3 \%$ were initially invalid for CT and NG respectively and $1 . 3 8 \%$ initially had failed results for both CT and NG. Following retesting up to two more times, $0 . 1 0 \%$ and $0 . 1 3 \%$ had final results of failed for both CT and NG. Table 22 through Table 29 summarize the data from the clinical specimen studies.

# 5.2.4. Chlamydia trachomatis (CT)

Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test for CT as defined by PlS are presented by gender, sample type, and symptom status in Table 22. Overall Sensitivity ranged from $9 3 . 7 \%$ to $9 8 . 4 \%$ . The sensitivity for CT was $9 4 . 9 \%$ $9 4 . 0 \%$ $9 8 . 4 \%$ $9 7 . 6 \%$ $9 8 . 2 \%$ , $9 4 . 2 \%$ , and $9 3 . 7 \%$ for endocervical swabs, female urine specimens, male urinc specimens, self-collected vaginal swabs, clinician-collected vaginal swabs, and PreservCyt specimens (prc- and post-ThinPrep processing), respectively. Overall specificity ranged from $9 8 . 8 \%$ to $9 9 . 8 \%$ in both females and males. Performance estimates for CT detection were simila between symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects.

Table 23 and Table 24 summarize the results from symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects designated as infected or non-infected with CT (females and males, respectively) according to the PIS algorithm. A total of 365 females and 122 males were infected with CT. Symptoms were reported in $4 4 . 4 \%$ (162/365) of infected and $3 7 . 0 \%$ (1,814/4,900) of non-infected women. Similarly, symptoms were reported in $5 7 . 4 \%$ (70/122) of infected and $3 3 . 8 \%$ (208/616) of non-infected men. Overall, the CT prevalence was $6 . 9 \%$ (365/5,265), $1 6 . 5 \%$ (122/738), and $8 . 1 \%$ (487/6,003) in women, men, and the entire study population, respectively.

Table 26 and Table 27 summarize the results from symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects designated as infected or non-infected with NG (females and males, respectively) according to the PIS algorithm.

A total of 92 females and 67 males were infccted with NG. Symptoms were reported in $4 6 . 7 \%$ (43/92) of infected and $3 7 . 4 \%$ (1,932/5,171) of non-infected women. Similarly, symptoms were reported in $8 9 . 6 \%$ (60/67) of infected and $3 2 . 5 \%$ (218/671) of non-infected men. Overall, the NG prevalence was $1 . 7 \%$ (92/5,263), $9 . 1 \%$ (67/738), and $2 . 6 \%$ (159/6,001), respectively, in women. men, and the entire study population.

# 5.2.6. Prevalence

The prevalence of CT and NG in patient populations depends upon a variety of factors including age, gender, the presence of symptoms, clinic type, and test method. The prevalence of CT observed with the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test during a multi-center clinical trial ranged from $5 . 0 \%$ to $8 . 9 \%$ in females , and from $1 1 . 3 \%$ to $2 5 . 2 \%$ in males (Table 22); the prevalence of NG ranged from $0 . 9 \%$ to $2 . 3 \%$ in females, and from $1 . 5 \%$ to $2 1 . 6 \%$ in males (Table 25).

# 5.2.7. Positive and Negative Predictive Value

Hypothetical positive and negative predictive values (PPV & NPV) derived from discase prevalence of 1 to $50 \%$ for the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test are shown in Table 28 and Table 29. The overall sensitivity and specificity (compared with PIS) were $9 4 . 1 \%$ and $9 9 . 6 \%$ , respectively, for CT; and $9 7 . 1 \%$ and $9 9 . 8 \%$ , respectively, for NG.

Overall sensitivity and specifcity were estimated by comparing the cobas® CT/NG $\mathtt { v } 2 . 0$ Test results to patient infected status across all sample types in both female and male subjects. Note: $P P V =$ positive predictive value; $N P V =$ negative predictive value.

# 6. CONCLUSION

A comparison of the intended use, technological characteristics, and the results of non-clinical analytical and clinical performance studies demonstrate that the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
