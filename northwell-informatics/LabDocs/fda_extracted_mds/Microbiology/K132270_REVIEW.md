# L. Test Principle:

The cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae is based on two processes: (1) automated sample preparation to obtain CT and NG DNA; (2) simultaneous PCR amplification of target DNA sequences using both CT and NG specific primer pairs and real-time detection of cleaved fluorescent-labeled CT and NG specific oligonucleotide detection probes. An Internal Control, containing CT and NG DNA, is added to all samples prior to automated sample preparation and is amplified and detected simultaneously with each sample to monitor the entire process.

Sample preparation for the cobas CT/NG v2.0Test is automated with the use of the cobas x 480 instrument. Specimens are lysed in the collection device by the chaotropic agent in the cobas PCR Media. Released nucleic acids, along with added CT/NG Internal Control DNA, are purified through binding to magnetic glass particles, washed, and separated from these particles making them ready for PCR amplification and detection.

The Master Mix reagent contains primer pairs and probes specific for the CT cryptic plasmid DNA, the CT genomic ompA gene DNA, NG genomic DNA sequences A and B within the DR-9 region, and CT and NG Internal Control DNA.

The cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test detects a DNA sequence in the cryptic plasmid common to all serovars of $C .$ . trachomatis as well as a separate DNA sequence within the $C .$ trachomatis chromosome. For $N .$ gonorrhoeae, the test detects two targeted sequences in a highly conserved direct repeat region.

# Target Amplification

Processed samples are added to the amplification mixture in a microwell plate in which PCR amplification occurs. The reaction mixture is heated to separate the isolated double-stranded DNA and expose the primer target sequences. As the mixture cools, the primers anneal to the target DNA. Z05 DNA polymerase, in the presence of $\mathrm { M n } ^ { 2 + }$ and excess dNTPs, extends the annealed primers along the target templates to produce double-stranded DNA. This completes the first cycle of PCR, yielding a double-stranded DNA copy of the target regions of the CT and/or NG DNA and the CT/NG Internal Control DNA. Repetition of this process results in the amplification of DNA between the primer target sequences, producing a double-stranded DNA molecule termed an amplicon. The cobas $\mathbf { z } 4 8 0$ analyzer automatically repeats this process for a designated number of cycles, with each cycle intended to double the amount of amplicon DNA.

# Internal Control Amplification

The CT/NG Internal Control is a combination of two non-infectious recombinant plasmid DNAs, each with primer binding regions identical to those of either the $C .$ . trachomatis or the N. gonorrhoeae genomic target sequences. Both recombinant plasmid DNAs have an identical randomized internal target sequence, and a unique probe binding region that differentiates the CT/NG Internal Control from target amplicon. These features were selected to ensure independent detection of both the CT/NG Internal Control and the $C .$ trachomatis and $N .$ gonorrhoeae target DNAs. The CT/NG Internal Control Reagent is included in the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test and is introduced into each sample on the cobas $\mathbf { x } 4 8 0$ instrument during sample processing.

# Selective Amplification

Selective amplification of target nucleic acid from the specimen is achieved in the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test by the use of AmpErase (uracil-N-glycosylase) enzyme and deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP). The AmpErase enzyme recognizes and catalyzes the destruction of DNA strands containing deoxyuridine, but not DNA containing deoxythymidine. Deoxyuridine is not present in naturally occurring DNA, but is always present in amplicon due to the use of deoxyuridine triphosphate in place of thymidine triphosphate as one of the dNTPs in the Master Mix reagent; therefore, only amplicon contain deoxyuridine. Deoxyuridine renders contaminating amplicon susceptible to destruction by AmpErase enzyme prior to amplification of the target DNA. AmpErase enzyme, which is included in the Master Mix reagent, catalyzes the cleavage of deoxyuridine-containing DNA at the deoxyuridine residues by opening the deoxyribose chain at the C1-position. When heated in the first thermal cycling step at the alkaline pH of Master Mix, the amplicon DNA chain breaks at the position of the deoxyuridine, thereby rendering the DNA non-amplifiable. AmpErase enzyme is inactive at temperatures above $5 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , i.e., throughout the thermal cycling steps, and therefore does not destroy target amplicon. The cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test has been demonstrated to inactivate at least $\mathrm { i } 0 ^ { 3 }$ copies of deoxyuridine-containing CT/NG amplicon per PCR.

# Detection of PCR Products

The cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test utilizes real-time PCR technology. The use of fluorescent probes enables real-time detection of PCR product accumulation by monitoring the emission intensity of fluorescent dyes released during the amplification process. The probes include CT cryptic plasmid, CT ompA, NG DR-9A, NG DR-9B and CT/NG Internal Control-specific oligonucleotides, all labeled with a reporter dye and a quencher. When the fluorescent dyelabeled probes are intact, the reporter fluorescence is suppressed by the proximity of the quencher due to Förster-type energy transfer effects. During PCR, the probes hybridize to their respective target sequence and are cleaved by the $5 ^ { \circ }$ to $3 ^ { \circ }$ nuclease activity of the thermostable Z05 DNA polymerase. Once the reporter and quencher are separated, quenching no longer occurs, and the fluorescent emission of the reporter dyes increases. The amplification of CT targets, NG targets and the CT/NG Internal Control are measured independently and at different wavelengths. This process is repeated for a designated number of cycles, each cycle increasing the emission intensity of the individual reporter dyes.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision:

Precision of the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test was evaluated in-house using a panel composed of CT and NG cultures diluted into the following three natural specimen matrices that were predetermined to be negative for both CT and NG prior to spiking:

· Pooled negative vaginal swab specimen matrix in cobas PCR Media · Pooled negative urine in cobas PCR Media   
· Pooled negative PreservCyt specimens.

The precision panel for each of the three matrices contained one negative panel member and three positive panel members containing combinations of CT and NG at 1X and 3X LOD. Testing was performed with three lots of cobas CT/NG v.2.0 Test reagents in 24 runs on three instruments over 12 days. A total of 48 replicates were tested for each panel member. Study results demonstrated the expected hit rates for all positive panel members and $100 \%$ negative results for all replicates of the negative panel member. Analysis of variance of Cycle Threshold $\mathrm { ( C t ) }$ values from valid tests performed on positive panel members demonstrated overall Coefficient of Variation $( \mathrm { C V } ) \%$ ranges from $1 . 0 \%$ to $3 . 0 \%$ for CT and from $1 . 0 \%$ to $2 . 0 \%$ for NG. Detailed results for this study are presented in the tables below.

Additional in-house precision testing was performed with samples containing CT and NG concentrations below the LoD (high negative samples). Panel members were prepared by spiking CT and NG cultures into a pool of vaginal specimen matrix collected in cobas PCR Media, a pool of urine matrix stabilized in cobas $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ PCR Media and a pool of cervical specimen matrix collected in PreservCyt Solution to organism levels designed to give a negative result approximately 20 to $80 \%$ of the time. Negative panel members were also prepared for each matrix. For each sample matrix, panels were tested over the course of 12 days by two operators using three lots of reagents and two cobas 4800 Systems. Two replicates of each panel member were tested in each run, generating up to 48 test results for each panel member. Testing of the high-negative panel member yielded the anticipated hit rate for all three matrices.

# b. Reproducibility:

A Reproducibility Study was performed across testing sites, operators, runs, and days for the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test using panels of samples separately prepared in the following natural specimen matrices that were predetermined to be negative for both CT and NG prior to spiking:

Pooled negative vaginal swabs collected in cobas PCR Media Pooled negative urine matrix stabilized in cobas PCR Media · Pooled negative cervical specimen matrix collected in PreservCyt Solution.

The positive panel members for each matrix contained CT or NG at concentrations of 1 x LOD and $3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ }$ LOD. Also included was one negative sample containing matrix only. Testing was performed at two external sites and one in-house site. A run for cobas PCR Media (urine and swab) included three replicates of each of five panel members and one positive and one negative control (32 total tests). A run for the PreservCyt Solution panel included three replicates of each of five panel members and one positive and one negative control (17 total tests). Two operators at each site performed one run per day each, for a total of five days of testing per operator per panel type (10 days of testing total for each panel type). Testing was performed with one reagent lot.

Overall, 127 runs were performed: 62 included a combination of urine and swab samples and 65 included only PreservCyt samples. Seven failed runs (two runs with urine/swab samples and five runs with PreservCyt samples) were attributed to protocol deviations and instrument errors. There was one invalid test result in a PreservCyt sample and one failed test result each in swab, urine and PreservCyt samples. These failed tests were due to instrument errors.

All valid test results were included in the separate analyses of the percent agreement for CT and NG for each panel type. For negative panel members, there were no false positive results for all three matrices thus resulting in negative percent agreement (NPA) of $100 \%$ for both CT and NG.

# Reproducibility Results for CT:

Testing resulted in $100 \%$ positive percent agreement for samples prepared in all three matrices containing CT concentrations at 3X LOD as well as samples prepared in a urine matrix with CT concentrations at 1X LOD. Samples prepared in vaginal swab and PreservCyt matrices containing CT at 1X LOD demonstrated $9 6 . 7 \%$ and $9 8 . 9 \%$ positive percent agreement. Analysis of variance components of Ct values for CT-positive panel members demonstrated overall CV's ranging from $1 . 4 \%$ to $2 . 6 \%$ for all three matrices. Detailed results from testing are presented in the following tables:

# Reproducibility Results for NG:

Testing of samples containing NG concentrations at 3X LOD resulted in $100 \%$ positive percent agreement for samples prepared in vaginal swab and PreservCyt matrices and $9 9 . 4 \%$ agreement for samples prepare in a urine matrix. Samples containing NG concentrations at approximately 1X LOD demonstrated $9 5 \%$ , $8 9 . 4 \%$ , and $9 9 . 4 \%$ positive percent agreement respectively for samples prepared in urine, vaginal swab, and PreservCyt matrices. Analysis of variance components of $\mathrm { C t }$ values for NG-positive panel members demonstrated overall CV's ranging from $1 . 6 \%$ to $2 . 6 \%$ for all three matrices. Detailed results from testing are presented in the following tables:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Controls:

One set of cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test Positive and Negative Controls are required to be included in each run. Valid results must be obtained for both the Positive and Negative Controls for the cobas 4800 Software in order for run results to be displayed. The CT/NG positive $( + )$ Control contains non-infectious DNA plasmids of both CT and NG sequences and is used as a run control to monitor the target capture, amplification, and detection steps of the test. The CT/NG Negative (-) Control contains buffer with no nucleic acid.

The cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test includes a CT/NG Internal Control that is added to each specimen and control during specimen processing on the cobas x instrument. The Internal Control is a combination of two non-infectious recombinant plasmid DNAs, each with primer binding regions identical to those of either the CT or the NG genomic target sequences. The Internal Control monitors test specimens for the presence of PCR inhibitors. The Internal Control is also required for validation of the run controls.

# Specimen Stability:

Specimen Stability was evaluated for ambient temperature storage and shipping for the following four specimen types:

· Urine stabilized in cobas PCR Media (male and female urine pools) · Endocervical swab specimens collected in cobas PCR Media · Vaginal swab specimens collected in cobas PCR Media Cervical specimens collected in PreservCyt solution (primary and secondary containers)

Samples were prepared for each specimen matrix by combining leftover negative specimens into multiple unique pools. CT and NG cultures were spiked into each pooled matrix to approximately 3 X LoD. The study included testing of matrix only samples as well. Testing was performed on the day of sample preparation and at several time points during the storage time period. Study results demonstrated that positive samples remain positive for a minimum of 12 months when stored at $3 2 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , with no significant change in $\mathrm { C t }$ values. In addition, matrix-only samples yielded the expectant negative result for the same storage conditions. For PreservCyt matrices that are transferred to a secondary container, study results support the claim of up to four week storage at $3 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

Additional assessment of specimen stability was performed for storage of specimens at 2- $8 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ . A minimum of 54 positive and 20 negative previously tested archived specimens were tested for each specimen type after long term storage at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . Positive specimens were chosen based on the Ct values obtained when initially tested with the majority being low positives ( $\mathrm { C t }$ values above 35). Testing results demonstrated that each specimen type is stable for up to 12 months at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { \% } }$ .

In summary, specimen stability study results support the claimed storage conditions.

# Processed Specimen Stability

Processed specimen stability was evaluated for each of the four specimen types described above for both ambient air (up to $3 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and refrigerated storage conditions $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . For this study, 12 specimens for each matrix were spiked with CT and NG cultures at approximately 3X the LoD. Immediately after the completion of sample preparation, extraction plates containing the processed specimens (eluates) were sealed and stored at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for up to eight days or $3 7 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 24 hours. After storage, eluates for each sample were tested using the CT/NG PCR-only workflow. All negative samples and positive samples yielded the expected results at $\mathrm { T } _ { 0 }$ . All positive samples were positive after storage at eight days with no significant change in $\mathrm { C t }$ values. One negative vaginal swab sample gave a positive result at day eight and again upon retesting. It was determined that the most likely cause of this unexpected false positive result was contamination. A new set of positive and negative vaginal swab samples were prepared and tested at $\mathrm { { T _ { 0 } } }$ and after seven days and all results were correct. Study results supported processed specimen stability claims of seven days at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and 24 hours at ambient temperature.

# d. Detection limit:

The analytical sensitivity (Limit of Detection or LOD) for the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test was determined by testing dilutions of quantified CT (serovars D and I) and NG (isolates

2948 and 6693) cultures into the following matrices:

· Pooled negative endocervical swab specimens in cobas PCR Media · Pooled negative vaginal swab specimens in cobas PCR Media · Pooled negative male and female urine specimens in cobas PCR Media · Pooled negative cervical specimen in PreservCyt Solution

All CT serovars and NG strains were tested at five concentration levels (60 replicates for each level). In addition, 24 replicates of a negative sample were tested. Replicates for each level were analyzed using the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test across three lots of reagents with the claimed LOD as the target concentration which can be detected in $2 9 5 \%$ of tested replicates.

The LOD for the CT serovar D and I cultures and NG strains 2948 and 6693 for each matrix are shown in the following table:

# e. Inclusivity

Inclusivity testing with the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test was performed for 13 additional CT serovars, the Swedish new variant strain (nvCT) and an additional 43 independently isolated strains of NG. Testing was done to demonstrate that these targets can be detected at concentrations near the LOD previously determined for CT serovars D and I and NG strains 2948 and 6693. Samples for this study were prepared by diluting titered CT and NG cultures into pooled negative endocervical swab specimen matrix in cobas PCR Media, pooled negative vaginal swab specimen matrix in cobas PCR Media, pooled negative urine specimen matrix plus cobas PCR Media and pooled negative cervical specimen in PreservCyt Solution. A minimum of 20 replicates were tested for each strain, dilution, and matrix using one lot of cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test reagents. Results are shown in the tables below. For NG, all strains with identical results are presented as a group, shown in the columns labeled “Numbers of NG Strains”.

# f. Analytical specificity:

Because there is no change in the assay reagents for the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test as compared to the cleared cobas CT/NG Test (K110923), it was concluded that the data for the analytical specificity testing from the first clearance could be used to support the performance of the $\mathrm { v } 2 . 0$ test. In this study, a panel of 184 bacteria, fungi, and

viruses, including those commonly found in the female urogenital tract, as well as representatives of $N .$ . cineria, N. flava N. lactamica, N. perflava, N. subflava, and other phylogenetically unrelated organisms, were tested to assess potential crossreactivity (see table immediately following this section). Samples were spiked at concentrations of $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ Units $\ast / \mathrm { m L }$ or higher for the majority of organisms tested. The second table below lists selected organisms that were evaluated at lower concentrations. Organisms were spiked into pooled negative urine in cobas PCR Media, pooled negative vaginal matrix in cobas® PCR Media, and pooled negative PreservCyt specimen matrices. No false positive results or interference of the internal control (IC) signal were observed for any of the organisms and matrices evaluated.

\*Definition of Units/mL: All bacteria were quantified as Colony Forming Units (CFU) except Chlamydophila pneumoniae was quantified as Inclusion Forming Units (IFU). Treponema pallidum and HBV were quantified as DNA copies. Adenovirus was quantified as Plaque Forming Units (PFU). CMV, EBV, HSV-1 and HSV-2 were quantified as Viral Particles (VP). HCV and HIV-1 were quantified in International Units (IU). Trichomonas vaginalis, HPV16 and HPV18 were quantified as cells/mL.

# g. Microbial interference

All organisms tested in the analytical specificity study listed in the table above were also evaluated for potential microbial interference with the detection of CT and/or NG. In this study, samples were prepared with each potentially interfering organism mixed with CT and NG cultures at approximately 3 times their respective LoDs. In addition, CT/NG positive and negative test samples (with no spiking of additional organisms) were used as controls. Study results demonstrated no false negative results and no deterioration in Ct values for either CT or NG analytes in all evaluated matrices.

h. Interference Study

Testing of Exogenous Substances:

Performance of the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test was evaluated in the presence of potentially interfering exogenous substances including over-the counter products and prescription drugs that may be present in clinical specimens. Samples were prepared in pooled negative endocervical swab specimen matrix collected in cobas PCR Media, pooled negative vaginal swab specimen matrix collected in cobas $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ PCR Media, pooled negative urine specimen matrix plus cobas $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ PCR Media and pooled negative cervical specimen matrix collected in PreservCyt Solution. Positive samples were spiked with each potentially interfering substance and CT and NG cultures at ${ \sim } 3 \mathrm { \Delta x }$ LOD for each target. For each substance and matrix evaluated, replicates of ten CT/NG positive and ten CT/NG negative samples were tested. Substances and matrices tested are listed in the following table.

$\mathrm { X = }$ Tested; NT $=$ Not tested

Results from this study demonstrated that 20 of the 23 exogenous substances tested did not interfere with the performance of the assay for detection of CT and NG. The presence of Metronidazole vaginal gel and Vagisil Satin were found to produce invalid and/or false negative results for either CT and/or NG in urine samples. Replens was found to produce invalid and/or false negative results for either CT and/or NG in both urine and

endocervical swab matrices. Limitations are included in the package insert describing assay interference with metronidazole vaginal gel, Vagisil Satin, and Replens.

Testing of Endogenous Substances:

Performance of the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test was evaluated in the presence of potentiallyinterfering endogenous substances including whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and mucus. Samples were prepared in urine, vaginal, endocervical, and PreservCyt matrices. For each substance and matrix evaluated, replicates of ten CT/NG positive and ten CT/NG negative samples were tested. Positive samples were spiked with each potentially interfering substance and CT and NG cultures at ${ \sim } 3 \ \mathbf { x }$ LOD for each target.

The presence of whole blood lead to false negative results when present in urine samples containing greater than $0 . 2 5 \%$ blood and in cervical specimens in PreservCyt solution at concentrations greater than $3 \%$ . In addition, invalid results were observed in urine samples containing whole blood concentrations greater than $0 . 2 5 \%$ and in PreservCyt samples containing whole blood at concentrations $5 \%$ or higher.

The presence of PBMC resulted in false negative results when present in urine samples containing greater than $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ cells/mL and in vaginal or endocervical samples containing greater than $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ cells/mL. Invalid or failed tests occurred in samples containing $\overline { { 1 } } \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ PBMC cells/mL presumably due to sample viscosity.

Limitations are included in the package insert describing each endogenous substance that demonstrated interference with the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test.

Potentially interfering endogenous substances and matrices tested are described in the following table. Concentrations in urine samples were determined using total sample volume, including stabilizing media.

# i. Carry over/contamination

CT/NG Workflow: Sample-to-sample cross-contamination and run-to-run carryover studies were performed using the CT/NG Workflow with samples in cobas PCR media and urine stabilized in cobas PCR Media. Two runs consisting of a checkerboard pattern of high-positive CT and NG samples alternating with negative samples were performed on each of three cobas 4800 Systems. Contrived samples were prepared by spiking high concentrations of CT and NG cultures into each matrix such that analyte concentrations would be higher than found in $9 5 \%$ of specimens of infected individuals in the intended use population. Study results for the CT/NG Workflow yielded a sample-to-sample cross contamination rate of $1 . 0 7 \%$ (6/562) and a run-to-run carry over rate of $0 . 1 8 \%$ (1/563).

CT/NG Cytology Workflow: Three additional runs were performed on each of three cobas 4800 Systems using the CT/NG Cytology Workflow using contrived samples in PreservCyt Solution. Again, specimens were tested in a checkerboard configuration of high-positive CT and NG specimens alternating with negative samples. The CT/NG Cytology Workflow gave a sample-to-sample cross-contamination rate of $1 . 1 8 \%$ (5/423) and a run-to-run carry over rate of $0 . 0 \%$ (0/280).

ThinPrep 2000 Workflow: The rate of sample-to-sample cross-contamination events during routine processing of PreservCyt specimens on the ThinPrep 2000 liquid cytology processor was performed using alternating CT/NG negative and CT/NG high-positive samples. After cytology processing, the PreservCyt samples were then tested with the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test. False positive results occurred in two of 427 CT/NG negative samples, resulting in a cross-contamination rate of $0 . 8 1 \%$ .

# j. Assay cut-off:

The assay cutoff (Ct value $= 4 5$ ) for the cobas CT/NG Test (K110923) that was validated for the initial clearance of the assay was also selected for the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test. The chosen cutoff was subsequently validated for the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test by analyzing all results from the pivotal clinical study and selected analytical studies. All specimen types were included in the analysis. The distribution of Ct values for positive specimens was analyzed and it was determined that the chosen cutoff is acceptable due to the evidence of a clear distinction between positive and negative results for all specimen types. The following graphs illustrate the distribution of Ct values from the clinical study.

# k. Competitive Inhibition Studies

Panels were prepared by spiking CT and NG cultures into pooled vaginal specimen matrix collected in cobas PCR Media, pooled urine matrix stabilized in cobas PCR Media and pooled cervical specimen matrix collected in PreservCyt Solution at various concentration levels to examine the potential for competitive inhibition. Panels were tested in two runs per day over the course of 12 days. Two replicates of each panel member were tested in every run, generating a maximum of 48 test results for each level and CT and NG strain respectively. All CT and NG hit rates were $100 \%$ for all panel levels in all sample matrices tested. Competitive inhibition was not seen in any combination of CT and NG levels in any of the three sample matrices tested. Average Ct values for each of the panel levels are summarized in the table below.

3. Clinical studies:

The clinical performance of the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test was established in two multicenter clinical studies conducted in the United States. One clinical study included testing of archived endocervical specimens, self-collected and clinician collected vaginal specimens and urine specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic males and females, initially collected prospectively during the clinical evaluation of the cobas CT/NG Test (K110923). The current study included testing of all available prospectively collected specimens stored at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ since the original study.

The second clinical study included only asymptomatic female subjects and the following four prospectively collected and tested fresh specimens: endocervical specimens, clinician-collected vaginal specimens, cervical specimens in PreservCyt Solution, and female urines.

For both clinical studies, specimen collection took place at 18 collection sites in the US, which included family planning and obstetrics/gynecology (OB/GYN) clinics, and sexually transmitted disease clinics. Testing was performed at seven laboratory sites.

Each female subject provided a urine specimen, a self-collected or clinician-collected vaginal swab, a clinician-collected endocervical swab, and a cervical specimen in PreserCyt solution obtained with a spatula/cytobrush or a broom. Aliquots of urine and cervical specimens in PreserCyt as well as a second endocervical swab were placed in the respective transport media for determination of patient infected status (PIS) using two commercially available nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT).

Each male subject provided a urine specimen in cobas PCR media and urine and urethral swab specimens in collection media from two commercially available NAAT assays.

Subjects were classified as symptomatic if they reported symptoms indicative of CT or NG infection, as listed below. Subjects were classified as asymptomatic if they did not report these symptoms.

Dysuria/pain during urination, coital pain/difficulty/bleeding, discharge, or pelvic pain · Abnormal vaginal discharge · Pelvic/uterine/ovarian pain · Urethral discharge, testicular pain/scrotal pain/swelling

The clinical performance of the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test was evaluated by comparing the results from collected sample types to a pre-specified PIS algorithm as determined by combined results from two commercially available NAATs. The PIS algorithms for female and male patients are shown in the following two tables.

Primary objectives of the study included the evaluation the sensitivity (SENS), specificity (SPEC), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test for detection of CT or NG using PIS as the reference standard. Results were stratified by gender, sample type, and symptom status. Predictive values were calculated based on sensitivity and specificity with all data combined for a range of hypothetical prevalence values.

Of the 6,045 subjects enrolled (5,306 females and 739 males), ten were excluded from the analyses because they did not meet study entry criteria or because they withdrew consent; 31 were considered non-evaluable and were excluded from all statistical analyses because of errors in specimen collection, transport, storage, unknown PIS for both CT and NG, or invalid cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test results after initial testing and/or retesting. Therefore, of 6,035 total eligible subjects enrolled, 6,004 $( 9 9 . 5 \% )$ were evaluable for CT and/or NG primary analyses (5,266 females and 738 males). Results obtained from 1,011 prospectively tested specimens from female asymptomatic subjects were analyzed combined with results obtained in the re-testing of archived specimens collected in the previous clinical study (archived specimens collected from 4,255 females and 738 males).

In both clinical studies, there was 1/385 $( 0 . 3 \% )$ invalid runs and 15/385 $( 3 . 9 \% )$ failed runs due to instrument errors. Of the 26,283 specimens tested with the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test, $0 . 2 8 \%$ and $0 . 2 3 \%$ were initially invalid for CT and NG respectively and $1 . 3 8 \%$ initially had failed results for both CT and NG. Following retesting up to two more times, $0 . 1 0 \%$ and $0 . 1 3 \%$ had final results of invalid for CT and NG respectively and $0 . 1 4 \%$ had final failed results for both CT and NG.

# Clinical Study Results for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT)

The following two tables summarize the results from symptomatic and asymptomatic female and male subjects designated as infected or non-infected with CT according to the PIS algorithm. A total of 365 females and 122 males were infected with CT. Symptoms were reported in $4 4 . 4 \%$ (162/365) of infected and $3 7 . 0 \%$ (1,814/4,900) of non-infected women. Similarly, symptoms were reported in $5 7 . 4 \%$ (70/122) of infected and $3 3 . 8 \%$ (208/616) of non-infected men. Overall, the CT prevalence was $6 . 9 \%$ (365/5,265), $1 6 . 5 \%$ (122/738), and $8 . 1 \%$ (487/6,003) in women, men, and the entire study population, respectively.

Note: Subjects are designated as being infected with CT if at least 2 NAATs with different target regions give positive results in the endocervical swab (urethral swab for males) and/or the urine specimen. However, females are categorized as non-infected for any swab specimen if the swab specimens and the PreservCyt specimen (NAAT2) were negative and the urine specimens were positive. Note: $\mathrm { C I } =$ (score) confidence interval, PREV $=$ prevalence, SENS $=$ sensitivity, SPEC $=$ specificity, $\mathrm { P P V = }$ positive predictive value, $\mathrm { N P V } =$ negative predictive value.

For archived specimens from female asymptomatic patients, sensitivity for CT was $9 1 . 2 \%$ (93/102), $9 2 . 9 \%$ (104/112), $9 4 . 4 \%$ (51/54), $8 8 . 6 \%$ (93/105), and $8 7 . 5 \%$ (91/104), and specificity for CT was $9 9 . 9 \%$ (2,076/2,078), $9 9 . 8 \%$ (2,065/2,070), $9 9 . 9 \%$ (1,183/1,184), $9 9 . 6 \%$ (2,085/2,094), and $9 9 . 7 \%$ (1,881/1,886) respectively for endocervical swabs, female urine specimens, clinician-collected vaginal swabs, and PreservCyt specimens (pre- and post-ThinPrep processing).

# Clinical Study Results for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG)

The following two tables summarize the results from symptomatic and asymptomatic female and male subjects designated as infected or non-infected with NG according to the PIS algorithm. A total of 92 females and 67 males were infected with NG. Symptoms were reported in $4 6 . 7 \%$ (43/92) of infected and $3 7 . 4 \%$ (1,932/5,171) of non-infected women. Similarly, symptoms were reported in $8 9 . 6 \%$ (60/67) of infected and $3 2 . 5 \%$ (218/671) of non-infected men. Overall, the NG prevalence was $1 . 7 \%$ (92/5,263), $9 . 1 \%$ (67/738), and $2 . 6 \%$ (159/6,001), respectively, in women, men, and the entire study population.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

For the various collection sites in the multi-center clinical study, the prevalence of CT observed with the cobas CG/NG v2.0 Test ranged from $5 . 0 \%$ to $8 . 9 \%$ in females, and from $1 1 . 3 \%$ to $2 5 . 2 \%$ in males. The prevalence for NG ranged from $0 . 9 \%$ to $2 . 3 \%$ in females and from $1 . 5 \%$ to $2 1 . 6 \%$ in males.

The following two tables illustrate hypothetical positive and negative predictive values for the detection of CT and NG with the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test for potential prevalence of 1 to $50 \%$ . The overall sensitivity and specificity used for these calculations were derived from the clinical study results for all specimen types combined.

# N. Instrument Name:

Roche cobas $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 4800 System consisting of cobas $4 8 0 \mathrm { x }$ and cobas $4 8 0 z$ instruments.

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

The Roche cobas 4800 System operates in a batch mode with open sample tubes. The system may operate in full extraction and amplification mode or in PCR only mode with previously extracted samples. Urine, vaginal, and endocervical specimens collected in the appropriate cobas collection devices may be combined in the same run. PreservCyt specimens must be run separately from the other specimen types. Each run can 24 or 96 specimens.

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes __X____ or No

3. Specimen Identification: Specimens are identified using barcodes on specimen vials.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Specimens are placed on the cobas $\times 4 8 0$ instrument as open tubes and specimen processing is fully automated. After completion of specimen processing, the user transfers the plate carrier to the cobas $z 4 8 0$ instrument for automated amplification and detection. Specimens can be processed directly from primary collection vials or as aliquots of the specimen in secondary vials.

5. Calibration:

No calibration is required by the user. Roche technicians perform calibration periodically as required.

6. Quality Control: See Section "c" above.
