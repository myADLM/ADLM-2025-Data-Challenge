SASTM Influenza A Test, manufactured by SA Scientific, Ltd., San Antonio, TX.

Device Description:

The $\mathbf { S A S T M }$ Influenza A Test utilizes antibodies against influenza type A viral nucleoproteins. The ${ \tt S A S T M }$ Influenza A test begins with an extraction of Type A nucleoproteins. After the extraction has been completed, the sample is placed into the sample well of the test. The specimen is absorbed and migrates via capillary action through membranes that contain dried gold conjugated antibody, which is specific for influenza A viral nucleoproteins. If these nucleoproteins are present, a "half-sandwich" immunocomplex is formed. The membrane contains immobilized antibody to influenza A nucleoproteins, which binds the "half sandwich" complex. Thus, in the presence of influenza A nucleoproteins, a "whole sandwich" immunocomplex is formed and a visible, pink-colored line develops in the specimen zone of the test device. In the absence of an influenza A antigen, a "sandwich" immunocomplex is not formed and a negative result is indicated. To serve as a procedural control, a pink-colored control line will always appear in the control zone of each strip regardless of the presence or absence of influenza A nucleoproteins.

Intended Use:

SASTM Influenza A Test is a visual and rapid assay for the presumptive in-vitro qualitative detection of influenza A viral nucleoprotein antigens from nasal washes and nasal aspirates of symptomatic patients. The test is not intended for the detection of Influenza Type B viral antigen or Influenza Type C viral antigen. This test is for professional use only.

Negative results do not preclude infection with influenza A and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. It is recommended that negative results be confirmed by cell culture.

Conditions for Use:

For prescription use only.

Quality Controls:

The $\mathsf { S A S ^ { T M } }$ Influenza A Test provides an internal procedural quality control. It is recommended that external quality controls be assayed following the user's laboratory's standard quality control procedures and in conformance with local, state and federal regulations or accreditation organizations as applicable

Device comparison:

The SASTM Influenza A is a rapid immunoassays utilizing immunochromatographic technology for the visualization of influenza A antigen. Each utilizes an antibody conjugated to colored particles and an antibody printed onto a membrane. The chemistry of the predicate device and the proposed device is identical; the only difference is that the new inserts include sensitivity data for H7N9.

Performance Summary:

This test has been shown to detect the Influenza A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus cultured from a positive human specimen however, the performance characteristics of this test with clinical specimens that are positive for the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus have not been established. The SAS FluAlert A Test can detect influenza A virus, but cannot differentiate influenza subtypes.

Clinical Summary:

Please see K041441 for Clinical Summary

Analytical Sensitivity (Limit of Detection):

The analytical sensitivity of the SASTM FluAlert A Test was determined·for 2013 H7N9 using strain A/Anhui/1/2013. Each strain was serially diluted in ${ \mathsf { S A S } } ^ { \mathbf { T M } }$ Influennza A extraction buffer. Results for A/Anhui/l/2013 are included in the summary table below.

# Conclusion:

The information presented in the premarket notification demonstrates that the SASTM Influenza A Test reacts with a cultured strain of 2013 H7N9 (Influenza A/Anhui/1/2013). Although this test has been shown to detect the 2013 H7N9 from a cultured isolate, the performance characteristics of this test with clinical specimens that are positive for the 2013 H7N9 influenza virus have not been established. The SAS Influenza A Test can detect influenza A viruses, but cannot differentiate influenza subtypes. This viral strain used in this study was obtained from the CDC with a known titer. SA Scientific, Ltd did not verify this titer.

Substantial Equivalence:

Substantially equivalent to the SASTM FluAlert A&B Test, manufactured by SA Scientific, Ltd., San Antonio, TX.

Device Description:

The SASTM FluAlert A & B Test utilizes antibodies against influenza type A and influenza type B viral nucleoproteins. After the extraction has been completed, the sample is placed into two separate sample wells. The specimen is absorbed and migrates via capillary action through membranes that contain dried gold conjugated antibody, which is specific for either influenza A or influenza B viral nucleoproteins. If these nucleoproteins are present, a "half-sandwich" immunocomplex is formed. The membrane contains immobilized antibody to influenza A or influenza B nucleoproteins, respectively, which bind the "half sandwich" complex. Thus, in the presence of influenza nucleoproteins, a "whole sandwich" immunocomplex is formed and a visible, pink-colored line develops in the specimen zone of the test device. In the absence of an influenza antigen, a "sandwich" immunocomplex is not formed and a negative result is indicated. To serve as a procedural control, a pink-colored control line will always appear in the control zone of each strip regardless of the presence or absence of influenza A or influenza B nucleoproteins.

Intended Use:

SAS™m FluAlert A & B Test is a visual and rapid assay for the presumptive invitro qualitative detection of Influenza A and Influenza B viral nucleoprotein antigens from nasal washes and nasal aspirates of symptomatic patients. The test is not intended for the detection of Influenza Type C viral antigen. This test is for professional use only.

Negative results do not preclude infection with influenza A and/or influenza B and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. It is recommended that negative results be confirmed by cell culture.

Conditions for Use:

For prescription use only.

Quality Controls:

The $\mathbf { S A S ^ { T M } }$ Influenza A & Influenza B Test provides two (2) internal procedural quality controls. It is recommended that external quality controls be assayed following the user's laboratory's standard quality control procedures and in conformance with local, state and federal regulations or accreditation organizations as applicable

This test has been shown to detect the Influenza A/Anhu/2013 (H7N9)virus culturd from a postive uman H7N9 influenza virus have not been established.The SAS FluAlert A&B Test can distinguish between influnza A and B viruses, but cannot differentiate influenza subtypes. $^ { * * }$ This viral strain was obtained from the CDC with a known titer. SA Scientific, Ltd did not verify this titer.

# Conclusion:

The information presented in the premarket notification demonstrates that the SASTM FluAlert A&B Test reacts with a cultured strain of 20 13 H7N9 (FluA/Anhui/1/2013). There is no cross-reactivity observed on the "B" portion of the SASTM FluAlert A&B Test. Although this test has been shown to detect the 2013 H7N9 from a cultured isolate, the performance characteristics of this test with clinical specimens that are positive for the 2013 H7N9 influenza virus have not been established. The SAS FluAlert A&B Test can distinguish between influenza A and B viruses, but cannot differentiate influenza subtypes. This viral strain used in this study was obtained from the CDC with a known titer. SA Scientific, Ltd did not verify this titer.

Dear Mr. Torres:

We have reviewed your Section 5l0(k) premarket notification of intent to market the devices referenced above and have determined the devices are substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28. 1976. the enactiment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food. Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may. therefore. market the devices. subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration. listing of devices. good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you. however. that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.
