# I. Device Description:

The BD VeritorTM System RSV test is a chromatographic immunoassay with an instrumented read for the qualitative detection of Respiratory Syncytial Virus antigen (RSV fusion protein) directly from a nasopharyngeal swab. It utilizes lateral flow technology and a simple optical reflectance reader. The device utilizes monoclonal antibodies for detection and capture of the RSV antigen. Each test strip is designed with spatially-distinct zones containing a positive and negative internal control. The positive control zone ensures that the sample has flowed correctly, and the negative control zone serves to address non-specific signal generation. When specimens are processed and added to the test device, RSV antigen in the specimen binds to anti-RSV antibodies conjugated to detector particles in the RSV test strip. The antigen-conjugate complex migrates across the test strip to the reaction area and is captured by the line of RSV antibody on the membrane. A positive result for RSV is determined by the BD Veritor System Reader (purchased separately) when antigen-conjugate is deposited at the Test “T” position and the Control "C" position on the BD Veritor System RSV assay device. The BD Veritor™ System Reader determines the line intensity at each of the spatially-defined control zones and utilizes specific algorithms to determine the presence or absence of any target analyte. The total assay time is approximately 10 minutes with reactivity determined by the optical reflectance reader.

The BD VeritorTM System for Detection of RSV kit consists of (a) 30 pouched devices, each containing one test strip, (b) 30 tubes, each containing $4 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of RV Reagent D (a detergent solution), 30 flexible mini tip flocked swabs and one each of positive and negative external controls.

The test procedure instructs the user on proper collection of a nasopharyngeal swab. The patient specimen (a nasopharyngeal swab) is inserted and mixed in a prefilled unitized tube containing RV Reagent D (an extraction reagent) and added to the test device. RV Reagent D contains mucolytic agents that function to break down mucus in a patient specimen thereby exposing viral antigens and enhancing detection in the assay device. The swab is then removed and 3 drops of the tube contents are dispensed into the sample well of the device.

The test is allowed to stand at room temperature for 10 minutes after which time it is inserted into the reader.

# L. Test Principle:

The BD Veritor™ System RSV test is a chromatographic immunoassay where RSV viral antigens in the patient sample bind to anti-RSV antibodies conjugated to detector particles on the test strip. The antigen-conjugate complex migrates across the test strip to the reaction area and is captured by an antibody line imbedded on the membrane. The assay utilizes a proprietary enhanced colloidal-gold particle at the test lines as the means for identifying the presence of RSV viral antigens. The test devices are designed with four spatially-distinct zones including positive and negative control lines, a test line for the target analyte, and a background zone. The test line for the target analyte is labeled on the test device as ‘T’ for test position. The onboard positive control ensures the sample has flowed correctly and is indicated on the test device as $^ { \circ } C '$ . Two of the four distinct zones on the test device are not labeled. These two zones are an onboard negative control line and an assay background zone. The onboard negative control zone (not labeled on the test device) addresses non-specific signal generation. The remaining zone is used to measure the assay background and is also not labeled. The BD Veritor™ System RSV assay incorporates an active negative control

feature in each test to identify and compensate for sample-related, nonspecific signal generation. The BD Veritor™ System Reader uses a proprietary algorithm which subtracts nonspecific signal at the negative control line from the signal present at the test line. If the resultant test line signal is above a pre-selected assay cutoff, the specimen is scored as positive. If the resultant test line signal is below the cutoff, the specimen is scored as negative. The BD Veritor™ System Reader measures the amount of light reflected from various zones along the assay strip. The measurement of the assay background zone is also evaluated as the reflectance is compared to that of the control and test zones. The instrument analyzes the reflectance data to provide the proper interpretation.

The schematic of the test strip is shown below:

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

An analytical study was conducted over a period of 12 days to evaluate repeatability of the BD Veritor RSV test when used by two different operators. The test samples were prepared in a stabilizing liquid buffer at target concentrations of RSV to generate positive observation rates of approximately $5 \%$ (high negative), $9 5 \%$ (low positive) and $100 \%$ (moderate positive). The reproducibility samples were prepared by drying the liquid viral samples onto swabs. A negative swab sample was also included. Each day, each operator tested a group of 8 swab samples that were blinded and randomized and included negatives and positives $( \sim 5 \%$ positive, ${ \sim } 9 5 \%$ positive and $100 \%$ positive). The following table summarizes the results.

Another study was conducted over a period of 5 days to evaluate reproducibility of the BD Veritor RSV test across 3 testing sites; one site was a clinical laboratory while the other two were point-of-care sites. The samples were prepared in the same manner as above for the precision study. Two operators at each site tested a panel of 12 samples each day. The panel consisted of 3 replicates of each nominal concentration. The panels were masked and randomized. The percent of positive samples with the $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals (CI) for each panel member are shown below.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of detection for the BD Veritor™ RSV test was determined for five RSV strains. Initially 10-fold serial dilutions of RSV in saline were prepared and each was tested in triplicate to find the lowest level detectable by three readers. Further characterization was performed using closely spaced dilutions. The final LoD, a concentration producing $9 5 \%$ positivity, was confirmed by testing 60 replicates.

To demonstrate that the LoD findings were not influenced by matrix effects, the sponsor conducted a matrix equivalence study by testing two RSV strains in dilutions near the established LoD, using (1) saline, (2) BD Universal Transport Media (UTM), and (3) negative clinical wash/aspirate sample matrix. There were 20 replicates of each dilution tested with the BD Veritor RSV test.

The observed rate of positivity for VR-26 (Long Subgroup A) RSV strain at concentrations close to the established LoD $9 5 \%$ positivity rate), based on 20 replicates, ranged from $8 5 \%$ to $100 \%$ in both, the clinical matrix and UTM. Similarly, the observed rate of positivity for VR-955 (9320 Subgroup B) RSV strain at concentrations close to the established LoD ranged from $8 5 \%$ to $100 \%$ in clinical matrix and from $70 \%$ to $100 \%$ in UTM. These results suggest that there is no significant matrix effect on the assay performance at concentrations near LoD.

# e. Analytical specificity:

The BD Veritor for RSV test was evaluated for potential cross-reactivity with other microorganisms. Various bacteria, viruses and yeast were tested at clinically relevant concentrations. All determinations were performed in triplicate with no cross reactivity observed for any of the tested organisms. The results are shown below.

# g. Specimen stability:

The BD Veritor for RSV test is intended to be used with nasopharyngeal samples immediately after collection. However, since a delay in testing may occur in real life situations, the sponsor conducted a sample stability study to allow for such circumstances. In this study, RSV strains Long (A) and 9320 (B) were used to spike swabs at viral loads near the LoD. The swabs were held at room temperature and were sampled at $0 . 5 \mathrm { h r }$ intervals from 0 hours up to 2 hours after being spiked. All swabs tested as positive at all-time points for both strains and no deterioration of signal was observed. These results support the decision to allow patient testing to be conducted for up to 1 hour after collection of the NP swab.

# h. Assay cut-off:

The output of the BD Veritor Reader is provided in arbitrary units (AU) measuring reflectance. A “zero” AU signal is assigned when reading a white surface and 100 AU is the maximum signal that the Reader can provide. The assay cutoff was initially evaluated using negative specimens (with determined zero concentration of analyte) to assess the inherent noise level of the system which was determined to be approximately 0.4-0.5 AU. Additional measurements of contrived samples with concentrations near the cutoff plus leftover clinical samples were used to estimate a preliminary assay cutoff to be 1.5 AU ( $3 \mathrm { ~ X ~ } 0 . 5$ AU). Following an ROC analysis of the results, the final assay cutoff was determined to achieve optimal balance between maximal sensitivity without compromising the specificity. The selected assay cutoff was ultimately validated with clinical positive and negative samples in the clinical study. The results provided to the user are qualitative for any valid result, either positive or negative.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: See clinical studies below.   
b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable.

3. Clinical studies:

Performance characteristics of the BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of RSV test were evaluated in a multi-center prospective study across eight geographically diverse testing sites using nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs collected from patients with signs and symptoms consistent with respiratory tract infection. The study was conducted between November 2012 and June 2013. A total of 540 patients were enrolled in the clinical study of which 17 were excluded due to protocol deviations, leaving 523 specimens to be included in the calculations of estimates of assay performance. All specimens were collected from patients $< 6$ years of age. Of those, $5 8 . 3 \%$ (305) were from subjects $< 2$ years old and $4 1 . 7 \%$ (218) were from patients 2-5 years of age. There were 223 $( 4 2 . 6 \% )$ females and 300 $( 5 7 . 4 \% )$ males. Informed consent was obtained for all patients prior to testing. Two NP swabs were collected sequentially, one swab from each nostril, from each subject. One swab was placed into transport media for reference testing. The other swab was either placed in an empty tube until ready for testing, or tested immediately on the BD Veritor™ System. The order of swabs used for reference testing vs. the direct testing with the device was randomized. The direct testing with the BD Veritor device was intended to be completed immediately. If the sample could not be tested immediately, it was held at room temperature $( 2 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for no longer than one hour prior to testing. The reference testing consisted of RSV viral culture and PCR testing (using the remaining specimen) with an FDA cleared molecular test for RSV.

# .Clinical Performance

The performance of the BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of RSV test with NP swabs was estimated based on the comparison with results from viral cell culture (sensitivity and specificity) as well as in comparison with the results obtained by a PCR comparator method (positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA)).

# N. Instrument Name:

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

The Veritor™ System Reader is a small, battery powered, bench top instrument that is used to read the Veritor lateral flow test cassette. After the extracted patient sample has been added to the test cassette, the test is developed at room temperature for 10 minutes. The cassette is then placed into the reader where it is scanned. The cassette is divided into distinct zones where the analyzer reads the negative background, positive control, and the Influenza A and B specific zones. The reader applies an algorithm to determine the background of the test as well as the specific signal from the A or B test zones. The reader has a finite number of reads and will prompt the end-user as the total number of reads approaches the lifetime of the unit.

# 2. Software:

The Veritor™ System Reader is the identical instrument that has been reviewed and cleared with the BD influenza A and B assay K112277. FDA has conducted an additional review of the applicant’s instrument Hazard Analysis and software development processes associated with this specific device, the BD Veritor System for RSV.
