The test uses recombinant monoclonal antibody fragments (rFabs) to detect the PBP2a protein directly from bacterial isolates. The rFab and a control antibody are immobilized onto a nitrocellulose membrane as two distinct lines and combined with a sample pad, a pink/purple conjugate pad, and an absorption pad to form a test strip. Isolates are sampled directly from the culture plate and eluted into an assay tube containing Reagent 1. Reagent 2 is then added and the test strip is placed in the assay tube.

# L. Test Principle:

Alere™ PBP2a SA Culture Colony Test is a rapid immunochromatographic membrane assay that uses recombinant monoclonal antibody fragments (rFabs) to detect the PBP2a protein directly from bacterial isolates. The rFab and a control antibody are immobilized onto a nitrocellulose membrane as two distinct lines and combined with a sample pad, a pink/purple conjugate pad, and an absorption pad to form a test strip.

Isolates are sampled directly from the culture plate and eluted into an assay tube containing Reagent 1. Reagent 2 is then added and the dipstick is placed in the assay tube. Results are read visually at 5 minutes based on the presence or absence of a pink/purple Sample Line. A pink/purple Control Line appears in the top half of the test strip in a valid assay.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A reproducibility study was performed at three sites. Testing was done at three sites, using 18-24 hrs isolates that have been sub-cultured, by two operators in duplicates for five days. The reproducibility panel consists of six MRSA, and four MSSA; 10 isolates $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ tests (duplicates) $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ operators $\texttt { X 5 }$ days $_ { \textrm { X 3 } }$ sites $= 6 0 0$

Testing was done from each of the following media: Tryptic Soy Agar with $5 \%$ sheep blood, and Mueller-Hinton Agar induced with a $3 0 ~ \mu \ g$ Cefoxitin disk. There was $100 \%$ (600/600) agreement with expected test results.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability: Not applicable.

Stability:

The following Product Stability Studies were performed to generate real time and accelerated stability data to support the expiration date of each lot under stated conditions.

The materials used in this study were as follows:

· Alere PBP2a SA Culture Colony Test Devices · Alere PBP2a Culture Colony Test Reagent 1 · Alere PBP2a Culture Colony Test Reagent 2

Control Panel:

Stability conditions were set up as follows:

1. Accelerated –at $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and at $5 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$   
2. Real-Time at room temperature and at $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$

Results are outlined in Table 1 below:

Transfer Lot 1 devices, Reagent 1 and Reagent 2 remained stable at 52 weeks of real time at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and continued to hold after 40 weeks at $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , 20 weeks at $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and 10 weeks at $5 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . Transfer Lot 2 devices, Reagent 1, and Reagent 2 remained stable at 36 weeks at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , and continued to hold at 20 weeks at $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and 10 weeks at $5 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . See below Table 1 for Stability Summary.

\*Stability testing continues on these lots at the stated temperatures.

It is anticipated that the Alere PBP2a SA Culture Colony Test will have at least 12 months of stability.

# Quality Control:

The Alere PBP2a SA culture colony test has built-in positive and negative procedural controls. The manufacturer recommends that these controls be included in each test run.

1. Procedural Controls

a. The appearance of a blue line at the “control line” position can be considered an internal positive procedural control. If capillary flow has occurred, this line will always appear.   
b. In comparison to the color of the control line, the background color on the dipstick should be white within 5 minutes.

2. External Positive and Negative Controls:

The external controls tested during clinical and analytical testing are described in Table 2 below.

Table 2: Controls   

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>QC Organism</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ExpectedResult</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Result With Device</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>S. aureus ATCC 43300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Positive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Positive</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>S. aureus ATCC 25923</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Negative</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Negative</td></tr></table>

During the clinical study, external positive and negative controls were used for each new lot and each day of testing.

A total of 130 positive and negative external controls were tested in the clinical study and demonstrated $100 \%$ concordance with the expected results.

In addition to the above QC organisms, the analytical study included additional supplemental positive and negative controls that were tested in triplicate on each day of testing with results interpreted by two operators. All positive and negative daily controls generated the expected results on each day of testing.

d. Detection limit:

A limit of detection study was conducted using Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC BAA44) and the detection limit was determined to be $7 . 3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { C F U / m l }$ .

e. Analytical reactivity and specificity:

A total of 162 strains of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 112 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) were tested with the Alere PBP2a SA Culture Colony Test from each of the following media: Tryptic Soy Agar with $5 \%$ sheep blood, and Mueller-Hinton Agar induced with a $3 0 ~ \mu \ g$ Cefoxitin disk and all tests showed the expected results.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

A clinical study was conducted at three geographically diverse sites throughout the United States including Alere.

A total of $4 5 4 \ : S .$ aureus fresh isolates were tested from each of the following media: Tryptic Soy Agar with $5 \%$ sheep blood, Columbia agar with $5 \%$ sheep blood and Mueller-Hinton Agar induced with a $3 0 ~ \mu \ g$ Cefoxitin disk. Results were compared to those of $3 0 ~ \mu \ g$ Cefoxitin disk diffusion, according to Clinical and laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) interpretation. Alere PBP2a SA Culture Colony Test performance, including $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals, versus Cefoxitin disk diffusion, stratified by plate type is provided in Table 4 below.
