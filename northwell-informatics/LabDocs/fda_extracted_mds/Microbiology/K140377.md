510(k) Number (if known)

Device Name xTAG® Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP)

# Indications for Use (Describe)

The xTAG® Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) is a multiplexed nucleic acid test intended for the simultaneous qualitative detection and identification of multiple viral, bacterial and parasitic nucleic acids in human stool specimens or human stool in Cary-Blair media from individuals with signs and symptoms of infectious colitis or gastroenteritis. The following pathogen types, subtypes and toxin genes are identified using the xTAG GPP:

# Viruses

• Adenovirus 40/41 • Norovirus GI/GII • Rotavirus A

# Bacteria

# Parasites

• Cryptosporidium (C. parvum and C. hominis only) • Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica) • Giardia (G. lamblia only - also known as G. intestinalis and G. duodenalis)

The detection and identification of specific gastrointestinal microbial nucleic acid from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal infection aids in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal infection when used in conjunction with clinical evaluation, laboratory findings and epidemiological information. A gastrointestinal microorganism multiplex nucleic acid-based assay also aids in the detection and identification of acute gastroenteritis in the context of outbreaks.

# xTAG GPP positive results are presumptive and must be confirmed by FDA-cleared tests or other acceptable reference methods.

The results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decisions. Confirmed positive results do not rule out co-infection with other organisms that are not detected by this test, and may not be the sole or definitive cause of patient illness. Negative xTAG Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel results in the setting of clinical illness compatible with gastroenteritis may be due to infection by pathogens that are not detected by this test or noninfectious causes such as ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, or Crohn's disease.

# xTAG GPP is not intended to monitor or guide treatment for C. difficile infections.

The xTAG GPP is indicated for use with the Luminex® $1 0 0 / 2 0 0 ^ { \mathrm { m } }$ instrument system with xPONENT® software.

# Luminex

# xTAG GPP is not intended to monitor or guide treatment for C. difficile infections.

The xTAG GPP is indicated for use with the Luminex® 100/200™ instrument system with xPONENT® software.

Indication(s) for use: Same as intended use.

Special instrument requirements: Luminex 100/200 instrument with xPONENT software.

# Device Description:

xTAG GPP incorporates a multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with Luminex's proprietary universal sorting system (the xTAG Universal Array) on the Luminex platform. The xTAG Universal Array sorts nucleic acids onto discreet Luminex bead populations by virtue of highly specific “tag/anti-tag” hybridization reactions. The tags and anti-tags comprising the xTAG Universal Array are 24-mer oligonucleotide sequences not found in nature. The assay has been designed to simultaneously detect microbial targets and an internal control (bacteriophage MS2 added to each sample prior to extraction).

For each sample, $1 0 \mu \iota$ of extracted nucleic acid is amplified in a single multiplex RT-PCR reaction. Amplimers ranging from 58 to 202 bp (not including the 24-mer tag) are generated in this reaction. A five $\mu \iota$ aliquot of the RT-PCR product is then subjected to a hybridization/detection reaction that also includes bead populations coupled to 24-mer antitags. Each bead population is coupled to a unique anti-tag which is the exact complement of a 24-mer tag incorporated into a given amplimer. Thus, each Luminex bead population uniquely identifies a microbial target or assay control through a specific tag/anti-tag hybridization reaction. Signal is generated via a Streptavidin, R-Phycoerythrin conjugate.

The Luminex instrument sorts the products of these hybridization reactions and generates a signal in the form of a median fluorescence intensity (MFI) value for each bead population. The MFI values are generated by the xPONENT® software provided with the instrument using the GPP protocol parameters, and are analyzed by the xTAG Data Analysis Software (TDAS GPP (US)). TDAS GPP (US) applies algorithms to MFI values in order to generate a qualitative result for each microbial target selected for reporting to establish the presence or absence of bacterial, viral or parasitic targets and/or controls in each sample. The data analysis software also generates a qualitative result and compiles a report for patient samples and external controls assayed in a given run. Before data are analyzed, a user has the option to select a subset of the targets from the intended use of the xTAG GPP (for each sample).

# Analytical Performance:

The reagents tested in submission k121454 remain the same as the reagents used in testing performed towards this submission. Therefore, the study reports and results presented in the submission summary in k121454 for Analytical Reactivity, Carry-Over Contamination, Limit of Detection, Repeatability, Analytical Specificity (including Interference), Evaluation of Fresh vs. Frozen Stool, and Reproducibility / Precision are all still applicable to the new device. Results presented below for each of these studies are additive to results previously presented in k121454 and include results for Adenovirus 40/41, Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica), and Vibrio cholerae (V. cholerae) cholera toxin gene (ctx). This section of the summary includes updated results for these three analytes for the following studies:

1. Analytical Reactivity   
2. Carry-over Contamination   
3. Limit of Detection   
4. Repeatability   
5. Analytical Specificity and Interference   
6. Evaluation of Fresh vs. Frozen Stool   
7. Reproducibility / Precision

Additionally, a study demonstrating results of testing analytes in stool as compared to stool in Cary-Blair media is presented, at the limit of detection for each analyte to demonstrate that either sample type can be used with xTAG GPP.   
Finally, a summary of negative control failures and sample re-run rates for analytical   
performance studies is provided.

# Analytical Reactivity

Analytical reactivity was assessed through empirical testing of a wide range of clinically relevant GI pathogen strains, genotypes, serotypes and isolates representing temporal and geographical diversity for each analyte. Through testing of unique samples covering the additional intended use pathogens, reactivity was established at concentrations 2 to 3 times the limit of detection.

Adenovirus - The Limit of Detection (LoD) using Adenovirus 40, Zeptometrix 0810084CF (Dugan) and Adenovirus 41, Zeptometrix 0810085CF (Tak) were found to be $1 . 4 5 \mathsf { E } { + } 0 1 $ $\mathsf { T C l D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathsf { m L }$ (or $4 . 8 9 \mathsf { E } \mathsf { + } 0 6$ Copies/mL) and $7 . 6 9 5 { + } 0 0 \mathsf { T C l D 5 0 } / \mathsf { m L }$ (or $1 . 4 8 \mathsf { E } { + } 0 7 $ Copies/mL), respectively (see LoD section below). The following two samples were tested at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Atlanta, Georgia, USA). Note: these samples were different isolates of the strains used in the LoD study (See LoD section below). The amount of the viral target DNA for GP-093 and GP-094 was measured by real-time PCR and the Ct values generated were used to calculate the DNA copy number. The lowest reactivity titers for GP-093 and GP-094, were found to be at 3x and 1x multiple of LoD level, respectively.

Entamoeba histolytica - The LoD for Entamoeba histolytica, ATCC 30890 was found to be $2 . 8 8 \mathsf { E } { + } 0 1$ Cells/mL, equivalent to $4 . 3 0 \mathsf { E } \mathsf { + } 0 2$ Copies/mL (see LoD section below). For E.histolytica, ATCC 50007, 50481, 50738 and 50454, the titer information expressed in Cells/mL could not be obtained. To standardize the quantification units for all E.histolytica strains, in this Analytical Reactivity study the amount of target DNA was measured by real-time PCR and the Ct values generated were used to calculate the DNA copy numbers. The reactivity titers for most of the strains were in the range of $0 . 4 \times$ to $6 . 7 \times$ multiple of LoD level for E.histolytica. The reactivity titer for ATCC 50738 (Rahman) was found to be $_ { 0 . 2 \times }$ multiple of LoD level.

Vibrio cholerae - The LoD using Vibrio cholerae Pacini ATCC 14101 (serovar O:1) was found to be $2 . 3 4 5 { \scriptstyle + } 0 6 \mathtt { C F U / m L }$ . For this Analytical Reactivity study $3 \times \mathsf { L O D } { = } 7 . 0 2 \mathsf { E } { + } 0 6 ~ \mathsf { C F U / m L }$ , and this was used for initial reactivity testing. In addition to toxinogenic strains, (i.e. O1 and O139), the xTAG GPP assay also detects any non:O1 Vibrio strains that do express cholera toxin gene, ctx (xTAG GPP Vibrio primers target gene), but not the non:O1 strains that may cause clinical symptoms such as diarrhea by expressing a different virulence factor, which is likely the case for sample ATCC 14374 and other non:O1 strains in this table. Both non-O1 ATCC 25872 and non-O1 ATCC 25873 strains, were tested in sequencing assays and confirmed to contain the ctx gene with well conserved xTAG GPP Vibrio cholerae primer binding regions.

# Carry-over Contamination

The likelihood of carry-over contamination events was initially assessed and presented in k121454 by testing 2 representative pathogens (a bacteria and a parasite): C. difficile, and Giardia respectively. In this study, a representative virus (Adenovirus 40) was tested. This analyte was examined in the form of simulated samples prepared at concentrations just below the assay cut-off (High Negative, HN) and well above the assay cut-off (High Positive, HP). The target was examined in a set of 6 independent extractions. Each extraction was assayed in duplicate arranged in a checkerboard manner on a 96-well plate using xTAG GPP.

As with the results in k121454 for the representative bacteria (C. difficile) and parasite (Giardia), results with the virus (Adenovirus 40) showed that all 144 high negative samples remained negative when run on the Luminex 100/200 instrument for all three targets ( $100 \%$ HN). In addition, results for Adenovirus 40 showed that all 144 high positive samples remained positive when run on the Luminex 100/200 instrument ( $100 \%$ HP), as with the targets previously tested. Therefore a lack of carryover contamination has been demonstrated.

# Limit of Detection

As in the original study results presented for k121454, the LoD was assessed by analyzing serial dilutions of simulated samples made from high-titre stocks of commercial strains or high-titre clinical specimens (when commercial strains were not available). All simulated specimens were prepared in negative clinical matrix (stool). The data from serial dilutions were confirmed in at least 20 replicates of the selected dilution for each analyte target. Results of testing for the three additional analytes were as follows:

# Repeatability

As in the original study results presented for k121454, repeatability was assessed for each target by testing 20 replicates of each of two different analyte concentrations: a very low positive sample (at the LoD) and a moderate positive dilution level (5x-10x above the cut-off MFI). All replicates for each dilution level were examined starting from sample extraction with the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG system followed by xTAG GPP in a single run. For each set of 20 replicates, the same operator performed the testing on the same instrument system, using the same lot of extraction kit and xTAG GPP reagents. Results of testing were as follows:

The correct qualitative result was obtained for $\geq 1 9$ of 20 replicates at the low positive level and for 20 of 20 replicates at the moderate positive level for each analyte tested at these concentrations.

# Analytical Specificity and Potential Interfering Agents

Analytical specificity was assessed with respect to the following:

1. Propensity for cross-reactivity leading to false positive results: Potential cross-reactivity with pathogens (viruses, bacteria and parasites) associated with gastrointestinal (GI) infections that are not probed by the assay. Potential cross-reactivity was also assessed for commensal flora and non-microbial agents. Organisms were tested at high positive titres.   
2. Propensity for interference leading to false negative results: Potential interference by pathogens (viruses, bacteria and parasites) associated with gastrointestinal (GI) infections that are not probed by the assay. Potential interference by commensal flora was also assessed. Panel analytes were tested at low positive concentrations in the presence of highly concentrated non-panel organisms.   
3. Propensity for competitive interference leading to false negative results: Potential interference by GI pathogens that are detected by the assay was evaluated by testing one microbial target prepared at a concentration near the assay cut-off (LP) in the presence of a second microbial target prepared at a very high concentration (HP), and vice-versa. The combinations of analytes tested were selected based on the frequency of co-infections reported in the literature.

Results for the 3 categories of testing outlined above were detailed in the decision summary presented for submission k12454.

The following additions relevant to results for the additional 3 analytes are included here:

Two strains of Entamoeba dispar, ATCC PRA-353 and PRA-368, were tested as commensal flora for potential cross-reactivity with xTAG GPP Assay (Table 13), in addition to Entamoeba dispar PRA-260 included in k121454. One of the three E.dispar strains, ATCC PRA-353, tested at $3 . 0 \mathsf { E } \mathsf { + } 0 5$ cells/mL (or over ${ 1 0 } ^ { 4 }$ times LoD for E. histolytica) cross-reacted with E.histolytica. Testing at 4- fold lower titre (equivalent to $2 . 6 \mathsf { E } { + } 0 3$ multiples of E. histolytica LoD) did not produce a falsepositive call. E. histolytica xTAG GPP kit primers were analyzed in silico for cross-reactivity with E.dispar. Two E. dispar sequences were available in Genbank, Z49256 (unknown strain) and AB282661 (strain SAW1734Rc1AR). In addition, three ATCC strains, PRA-260, PRA-353 and PRA368, were sequenced at Luminex with primers flanking the xTAG GPP kit E. histolytica primer binding region. All five E. dispar sequences were identical in the E. histolytica GPP kit amplicon region. The forward primer was a perfect match to the E. dispar sequences, whereas the reverse primer had multiple mismatches, most notably, a 2-nt contiguous mismatch on the ${ \sf 3 ^ { \prime } }$ end. These mismatches in the reverse primer would cause a significant decrease in amplification efficiency, and, therefore, result in a negligible risk of obtaining a false-positive xTAG GPP result for $E$ . histolytica.

As the xTAG GPP testing demonstrated, a false-positive call is only possible when E. dispar is present at a very high concentration, $3 . 0 \mathsf { E } \mathsf { + } 0 5$ cells/mL (or over ${ 1 0 } ^ { 4 }$ times LoD for E. histolytica) or higher. Testing at 4-fold lower titer (equivalent to $2 . 4 \mathsf { E } \star 0 3$ to $2 . 6 \mathsf { E } { + } 0 3$ multiples of E. histolytica LoD) does not produce a false-positive call.

Astrovirus was used as a representative interfering pathogen associated with gastrointestinal (GI) infections that are not probed by the assay (See Table 14). The xTAG GPP analyte, in this case Adenovirus 40/41, was also run without a second analyte present. No interference was seen.

Non-panel interference with common commensal bacteria, yeast and parasites was evaluated for each target in the xTAG GPP assay. Organisms tested are presented in Table 15 below. Low positive samples of each analyte target in the assay were tested in the presence of a high positive sample of the potential interfering microorganism. All non-panel bacteria and yeast were tested at a concentration of $6 E { + } 0 8 \mathsf { c f u / m L }$ except for Blastocystis hominis (ATCC 50587 - concentration $\ge 1 \mathsf { E } + 0 6$ cells/mL and ATCC 50608 - concentration $2 . 0 0 \mathsf { E } { + } 0 7$ cells/mL). No interference was found with the xTAG GPP analytes Adenovirus, Entamoeba histolytica and Vibrio cholerae.

Potential interference with GI pathogens that are a part of the assay (competitive interference) was evaluated with one target prepared at a concentration near the assay cut-off (LP) and the other target prepared at a very high concentration (HP) and vice versa. In each case, xTAG GPP Analyte 1 was also run without a second analyte present. Results (interference in making the appropriate calls) are shown in Table 16. There was no competitive interference observed between pathogens probed by xTAG GPP when testing was carried out with the mixed analyte samples described below.

The pathogens listed in Table 17 were not attainable. However, an in silico analysis was performed to assess the potential for non-specific cross-reactivity of these microbial pathogens with the primers used in xTAG GPP. These pathogens do not exhibit sufficient sequence homology against the xTAG GPP primer sequences, and therefore would not be expected to cross-react with the exception of Entamoeba coli and Taenia saginata.

From the in silico analysis, Entamoeba coli may cross-react with xTAG GPP primers based on the strong forward primer alignment of E_histolytica-FR_RVM77 (16 bp contig. on the ${ \sf 3 ^ { \prime } }$ end) and reverse primer E_coli_stx1-Rev_Biosg_2 (10 bp contig. on the ${ \sf 3 ^ { \prime } }$ end), as well as an amplimer size (138 bp) which is well within the design of the kit. To further elucidate, a thermal melting temperature (Tm) analysis was performed using the DINAMelt (Di-Nucleic Acid hybridization and melting prediction) program available at http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/?q=DINAMelt. Sequences of Entamoeba coli that aligned to the xTAG primers were analyzed to see if they would form a stable interaction with the xTAG primers which could possibly result in cross reactivity with the xTAG GPP kit. Mismatches would negatively impact the Tm of the primers and Entamoeba coli. At the xTAG GPP reaction temperature of $5 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } ,$ , the Entamoeba coli sequences would bind to the E. histolytica forward primer with approximately $6 4 . 4 \%$ of the Entamoeba coli sequences bound to the primer sequence, compared to binding of the forward primer to its target sequence without any mismatches $( 9 8 . 3 \% )$ . However, binding of the reverse E. coli stx1 primer to Entamoeba coli would be reduced to $0 . 1 \%$ compared to this primer binding to its target sequence without any mismatches $( 8 1 . 8 \% )$ . Therefore, Entamoeba coli is not likely to cross-react with the analytes in the xTAG GPP assay.

# Fresh vs. Frozen

As in the original study results presented in k121454, results from the Fresh versus Frozen study using samples for the additional analytes are presented here. This evaluation generated data to demonstrate that there is no significant difference in the performance of xTAG GPP between specimens tested from the “fresh” state (i.e. unfrozen) and specimens that were tested after being stored frozen at $\yen 70 ^ { \circ } C$ to $\boldsymbol { \mathbf { \ell } } _ { - 8 0 } \circ \boldsymbol { \mathbf { \ell } } { } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ . Each of the three additional analytes, Adenovirus 40/41, Entamoeba histolytica and Vibrio cholerae were assessed in a set of simulated specimens prepared in negative clinical matrix at a concentration close to the assay cut-off MFI (Low Positive), 5-10x the assay cut-off MFI (Moderate Positive) and, where possible, more than 10x the assay cut-off MFI (High Positive), where MFI is median fluorescent intensity value. Stability of un-extracted specimens, as well as pre-treated specimens, and finally, pre-treated and extracted nucleic acids were evaluated.

# One Month Stability Results

Positive agreement between fresh and frozen un-extracted specimens $w a s \geq 9 5 \%$ with a lower bound of the $9 5 \%$ (two-sided) confidence interval exceeding $85 \%$ for Adenovirus 40/41 and Vibrio cholerae.

Positive agreement between fresh and frozen pre-treated specimens $w a s \geq 9 5 \%$ with a lower bound of the $9 5 \%$ (two-sided) confidence interval exceeding $85 \%$ for Adenovirus 40/41, Entamoeba histolytica and Vibrio cholerae.

Positive agreement between fresh and frozen extracted specimens was $) 9 5 \%$ with a lower bound of the $9 5 \%$ (two-sided) confidence interval exceeding $85 \%$ for Adenovirus 40/41, Entamoeba histolytica and Vibrio cholerae.

Adenovirus 40/41 and Vibrio cholerae met the 1-month stability acceptance criteria, and the MFIs generated on HP, MP and LP replicates of frozen un-extracted, extracted and extracted specimens were generally close to those generated at baseline. However, the un-extracted specimen stability of Entamoeba histolytica did not meet the acceptance criteria.

# Three Month Stability Results

Positive agreement between fresh and frozen un-extracted specimens $w a s \geq 9 5 \%$ with a lower bound of the $9 5 \%$ (two-sided) confidence interval exceeding $85 \%$ for Adenovirus 40/41, Entamoeba histolytica and Vibrio cholerae.

Positive agreement between fresh and frozen extracted specimens wa $; \ge 9 5 \%$ with a lower bound of the $9 5 \%$ (two-sided) confidence interval exceeding $85 \%$ for Adenovirus $4 0 / 4 1$ and Vibrio cholerae.

The 3-month stability results for Entamoeba histolytica are of particular interest as they do not reflect the 1-month stability results. That is study criteria were met for the un-extracted specimen at 3-month stability time point but not at the 1-month time point. The 3-month stability data supports the stability of un-extracted Entamoeba histolytica frozen at $\scriptscriptstyle - 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ to - $\boldsymbol { \cdot } 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for 1 month. Study criteria for Entamoeba histolytica nucleic acid stability were met at the 1-month time point but not at the 3-month time point. Overall, the data supports the stability of un-extracted and extracted Entamoeba histolytica specimens frozen at $\scriptscriptstyle - 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ to $\mathfrak { - 8 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ for 1 month.

# Supplemental Stability Results - Entamoeba histolytica (un-extracted)

Additional data to support the stability of un-extracted Entamoeba histolytica specimens was also generated by analyzing LP and MP results obtained at site 1 (LMD) during the multi-site reproducibility study as well as testing LP and MP remnants at a later date. These results also suggest that un-extracted Entamoeba histolytica specimens are stable for at least 1-month when stored frozen at $\yen 70 ^ { \circ } C$ to $\mathfrak { - 8 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ .

Results are summarized for the un-extracted, pre-treated and extracted sample stability for the additional analytes in the following table.

^Based on supplemental testing results, possible titer or extraction issue with sample rather than stability failure

The results generated support the inclusion of frozen clinical specimens positive for all three targets, Adenovirus 40/41, Entamoeba histolytica and Vibrio cholerae, in the multi-site clinical evaluation of the xTAG GPP. Results generated also indicate that pre-treated material and nucleic acid extracts of all three targets evaluated are stable for at least 1 month post freezing.

# Precision / Reproducibility

Site-to-site reproducibility was assessed for each of the additional targets and for mixed analyte samples (representing co-infected samples). Original study results for the other analytes were presented in submission k121454. Replicates of simulated samples were tested across 3 sites by 2 operators at each site. One exception was made for testing of the Vibrio cholerae samples at Site 3, where due to operator illness the runs for the second operator were performed by two individuals. All sample replicates tested were prepared through serial dilutions of stock material (pre-treated negative stool spiked with a pathogen or positive stool) containing a microbial target from the intended use. Each sample replicate assayed in the study contained either a single microbial target or 2 microbial targets detected by xTAG GPP in addition to the internal control (bacteriophage MS2). For single analyte samples, dilutions tested fell into 1 of the following 3 categories:

1. High Negative (HN): microbial target concentrations which generate MFI values not lower than $20 \%$ below the cut-off MFI for the indicated analyte   
2. Low Positive (LP): microbial target concentrations which generated MFI values that were 1-5X the cut-off MFI for the indicated analyte   
3. Moderate Positive (MP): microbial target concentrations which generated MFI values 7- 10X the cut-off MFI for the indicated analyte

For those samples prepared to simulate co-infections, one microbial target was present at the LP level defined above and the other at a High Positive (HP) level. HP levels were defined as follows:

High Positive (HP) viral cultures were prepared to a concentration of $1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathsf { P F U / m L } ( 1 0 ^ { \circ }$ $\mathsf { T C l D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathsf { m L } )$ or higher; High Positive (HP) bacterial cultures were prepared to a concentration of $1 0 ^ { 6 } C F U / \mathrm { m L }$ or higher.

Each sample replicate underwent a single pre-treatment and extraction step. All samples were extracted using the NucliSENS easyMAG extraction method. Extracted material was kept frozen at $- 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ until testing. A total of 90 replicates were tested for each single analyte and dual analyte sample (3 replicates per run $\textsf { x 5 }$ runs per operator $\times 2$ operators per site x 3 sites $= 9 0$ replicates). Reproducibility was assessed both in terms of calls and MFI values.

# Single Analyte Results

For single analyte samples prepared at the MP level, depending on the microbial target, 89/90 $( 9 9 \% )$ to 90/90 $( 1 0 0 \% )$ replicates generated a positive result (after allowable re-runs). For LP dilutions, depending on the microbial target, the correct positive call was made in 85/90 (94%) to 90/90 $( 1 0 0 \% )$ replicates tested. For HN dilutions, depending on the target, the correct negative call was generated in as few as 67/90 $( 7 4 \% )$ replicates to as many as 90/90 $( 1 0 0 \% )$ . Greater variability in the HN dilution, compared to the LP and MP dilution, was expected based on the fact that a target is present in these samples at levels sufficient to generate MFI values $20 \%$ below the cut-off MFI, and based on the stochastic nature of end-point PCR in the presence of low levels of targeted analytes. Accordingly, percent variability, measured as the coefficient of variation (CV) for MFI values were lowest at the MP dilution and highest at the HN dilution. Results for single analyte samples are presented in Table 19.

# Dual Analyte Results

For dual analyte samples tested for the additional targets (Table 20), all targets generated a positive call when present as a HP dilution. When present at the LP concentration, 3 of the 4 target combinations tested generated a positive call in 90/90 $( 1 0 0 \% )$ replicates tested. The 4 combinations were:

Rotavirus (HP) / Adenovirus (LP) Adenovirus (HP) / Rotavirus (LP) C. difficile (HP) / Adenovirus (LP) Adenovirus (HP)/ C. difficile (LP)

C. difficile has two probes resulting in a call for this target, (if either is positive, the target is positive). The following was observed for the remaining target present at LP concentration in the sample containing a second target at HP concentration:

 1/90 replicates of the C. difficile (HP) /Adenovirus (LP) sample generated a negative call for Adenovirus

It should be noted that although the C. difficile LP sample was 89/90 for probe 1, probe 2 made all the calls for the LP sample. Overall, adequate site-to-site reproducibility has been established for all targets that xTAG GPP has been designed to detect (also see results in k121454).

# Stool in Cary-Blair Media Limit of Detection Study Results

The purpose of this analytical study was to evaluate the equivalency in the limit of detection (LoD) between the two sample types: raw stool (sample type from k121454) and stool in Cary-Blair transport medium (additional sample type commonly collected) in a representative sub-set of the xTAG GPP targets. One analyte from each of three pathogen classes (bacterial, parasitic, and viral) was examined in the form of simulated stool samples and simulated stool samples in Cary-Blair media. The simulated samples were prepared as a dilution series using high titre stocks. The three representative analytes tested in this study were: Clostridium difficile, Giardia lamblia and Norovirus GII. Results of testing presented in Table 21 demonstrate that raw stool samples and stool samples in Cary-Blair media have equivalent limits of detection.

# Clinical Performance:

# Matrix comparison study

Unchanged, reference results in k121454

# Detection in asymptomatic volunteers

In order to determine baseline levels for each analyte included in xTAG GPP for individuals who are not exhibiting signs and symptoms of infectious gastroenteritis, 200 clinical stool samples were collected from healthy, asymptomatic donors. Asymptomatic donors from various age groups were included in this study. Results presented below include the additional analytes in the xTAG GPP test. PCR inhibition, as determined by results for the internal control used with xTAG GPP (bacteriophage MS2), was observed in 23 of the 200 samples tested $( 1 1 . 5 \% )$ . After rerunning these specimens in accordance with the instructions for use, PCR inhibition was still observed in 8 samples $( 4 \% )$ . The absence of a detectable internal control signal in these samples meant that negative results for the indicated microbial targets could not be reported. Therefore, the final data analysis was conducted on 192 of the 200 samples collected for this study.

\*NOTE: Sample 216 was positive by xTAG GPP for both Norovirus GII and C. Difficile 1 Two (2) out of 3 xTAG GPP C. Difficile positive samples were confirmed as positive by sequencing analysis. 2 The (1) xTAG GPP E. histolytica positive sample was not confirmed as positive by sequencing analysis. 3 None of the 2 xTAG GPP Giardia positive samples was confirmed as positive by sequencing analysis. 4 None of the 3 xTAG GPP Noroviris GI/GII positive samples was confirmed as positive by sequencing analysis. 5 None of the 5 xTAG GPP Salmonella positive samples was confirmed as positive by sequencing analysis.

As described in submission k121454, results of the study demonstrated $2 9 7 \%$ negative percent agreement across all analytes in the 192 samples tested. Samples (at the specimen level) that were positive by xTAG GPP but negative by sequencing were considered false positives (12/192). These samples had MFI values that were relatively close to the cut-offs. 2 samples at the specimen level that were called positive by xTAG GPP were also positive by sequencing for C. difficile. These two samples positive for C. difficile by both xTAG GPP and sequencing probably represent asymptomatic infections.

# Detection in symptomatic patients (prospective clinical study in stool specimens)

The clinical performance of xTAG GPP for each analyte probed by the assay was evaluated in clinical specimens (stools) prospectively collected between June 2011 and February 2012. A total of 1407 clinical specimens were collected from pediatric and adult patients and submitted for testing at six (6) independent laboratories. Four (4) of the laboratories were located in the United States (Arizona, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas) and two (2) were in Southern Ontario (Canada). Demographic details for this prospective data set were summarized in the original submission k121454. In this submission, results for the additional analytes (Adenovirus 40/41, Entamoeba histolytica and Vibrio cholerae) are provided for the prospective clinical study for samples collected in stool. Additionally, these same samples were also stored in Cary-Blair media, and results of testing these are also provided.

All prospective clinical specimens were analyzed by reference/comparator at central laboratories independent of xTAG GPP testing sites.

Clinical runs and re-runs using xTAG GPP were carried out on clinical specimens that had been extracted from the fresh or frozen state using the NucliSENS easyMAG method (bioMérieux, Inc., Durham, NC) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total extracted nucleic acid material was stored at $\boldsymbol { - 7 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ prior to testing with xTAG GPP at each of the clinical sites. xTAG GPP positive results (expected values) for each individual target were summarized per age group in submission k121454, and are now summarized for the additional analytes in Table 26.

Accuracy determinations (diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative agreement) were based on the fraction of comparator positive (or negative) results which were also positive (or negative) by xTAG GPP. Sensitivity (or positive agreement) was calculated by dividing the total number of “true positive” xTAG GPP results (TP) by the sum of the TP and “false negative” (FN) xTAG GPP results. Specificity (or negative agreement) was calculated by dividing the total number of “true negative” xTAG GPP results (TN) by the sum of the TN and “false positive” (FP) xTAG GPP results. An xTAG GPP result was considered to be a TP or TN result only in the event that it agreed with the comparator method result for the analyte in question. $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals were calculated using the Wilson score method.

Since the reagents in the xTAG Kit remain the same, data from the original clinical study (k121454) are still applicable. Tables 27-29 present the stool results for each of the additional analyte targets added to the intended use of xTAG GPP for the clinical prospective sample set $\scriptstyle ( N = 1 4 0 7 )$ .

1A total of 95 specimens generated a “Nonspecific reaction, not characteristic of Clostridium difficile toxin. A titration test was performed on all 95 specimens and it was determined that in each case, the cytotoxicity reaction was not typical of C. difficile toxin.

When all of the analyte data is combined, xTAG GPP detected a total of 98 mixed infections in the prospective clinical evaluation. This represents $2 0 . 2 \%$ of the total number of xTAG GPP positive specimens (98/486). 62 (62/98; 63.3%) were double infections, 23 (23/98; $2 3 . 5 \% )$ were triple infections, 8 $; ( 8 / 9 8 ; 8 . 2 \% )$ were quadruple infections, 2 (2/98; $2 . 0 \% )$ were quintuple infections, $1 \left( 1 / 9 8 ; 1 . 0 \% \right)$ was sextuple infection, 1 was septuple infection $( 1 / 9 8 ; 1 . 0 \% )$ and 1 was octuple infection $( 1 / 9 8 ; 1 . 0 \% )$ . The single most common co-infection $( 2 0 / 9 8 ; 2 0 . 4 \% \% )$ was Norovirus GI/GII with C. difficile Toxin $\mathsf { A } / \mathsf { B }$ . Out of the 98 co-infections, 93 contained one or more analytes that had not been detected with the reference/comparator methods, i.e. discrepant co-infections.

# Detection in symptomatic patients (prospective clinical study in Stool in Cary-Blair Media)

Original comparator method test results for all samples in the prospective study (see k121454) were utilized for comparison to stool samples in Cary-Blair media for which adequate sample was available. The purpose of the study was to establish diagnostic accuracy of xTAG GPP in stool specimens in Cary-Blair medium. Clinical performance (sensitivity/positive percentage agreement and specificity/negative percentage agreement) of xTAG GPP on stool in Cary-Blair medium is summarized for each individual target in Table 31 below.

1In the case of Adenovirus $4 0 / 4 1$ , one of the clinical specimens that was concordant positive in the original GPP runs performed on raw stool yielded a negative result when tested in Cary-Blair. MFI generated in the original stool run were close to the assay cut off (195) suggesting a low titer specimen. Another specimen that was inhibited in the original stool runs performed on raw stool

${ \tt x T A G } ^ { \textregistered }$ GPP with Luminex $\textcircled { 3 } 1 0 0 / 2 0 0 ^ { \mathrm { { r m } } }$ Traditional 510(k) Submission

yielded a negative result in the Cary-Blair runs. Lastly, one specimen that was positive for Adenovirus $4 0 / 4 1$ by composite comparator was unavailable for re-testing in the Cary-Blair study. For these reasons, positive agreement of xTAG GPP for Adenovirus 40/41 dropped from $80 \%$ (4/5) in the raw stool study to $40 \%$ (2/5) in the Cary-Blair evaluation. Refer to the results of further evaluation testing contrived Cary-Blair samples close to the limit of detection (LoD) for Adenovirus 40/41.

2ETEC comparator results were calculated against a composite consisting of four well characterized nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) followed by bi-directional sequencing. All specimens that were false negative by xTAG GPP for ETEC were positive by only one out of four comparator NAATs. Repeat sequencing of these specimens were negative by all four NAAT, except for one sample which was positive by one NAAT.

Clinical sensitivity or positive agreement acceptance criterion of $90 \%$ with a lower bound $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of at least $80 \%$ was achieved for Norovirus GI/GII and Clostridium difficile toxin $\mathsf { A } / \mathsf { B }$ on stool in Cary-Blair media. The results were equivalent to those obtained for unpreserved stool specimens. Similar to the unpreserved stool, the lower bound $9 5 \%$ confidence interval for sensitivity was not met for all other targets probed by xTAG GPP on stool in Cary-Blair media. This can be explained by the low positivity rate in the prospective sample set.

Although a smaller sample set was used for the pre-selected arm of the study, positive agreement between comparator and xTAG GPP results was $100 \%$ for all pre-selected targets tested. Clinical specificity or negative percentage agreement acceptance criterion of $90 \%$ with a lower bound $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of at least $90 \%$ were achieved for all targets probed by xTAG GPP.

# Pre-selected stool specimens Retrospective Study

A total of 207 archived stool specimens that were positive by reference/comparator for pathogens that were of low prevalence in the prospective clinical study were collected at multiple sites in North America, Africa and Europe. Luminex was unable to source any stool specimens that tested positive for Vibrio cholerae by reference method for the pre-selected arm of the study. As previously noted, the range of analyte concentrations in these pre-selected specimens represented the clinically relevant range of concentrations observed in patients with gastrointestinal infection. All pre-selected positive specimens were tested with xTAG GPP at 4 sites (3 of which were external to LMD), along with negative clinical specimens in a randomized, blinded fashion. The “negative” designation for these specimens was based on the routine algorithms used at the banking site (e.g. bacterial culture, EIA, microscopy, in-house real time PCR). These algorithms did not test for all pathogen targets probed by xTAG GPP. Table 32 summarizes the positive agreement between reference/comparator and xTAG GPP for all preselected targets evaluated.

1- Eight (8)/8 E. coli 0157 were also positive for STEC by xTAG GPP. Sample remnants of all 8 E. coli 0157 specimens were tested for the presence of stx1 and stx 2 genes by bi-directional sequencing and the results added to those obtained for STEC.

2- One (1) false negative Giardia specimen was reported. This specimen was also negative for Giardia by in-house real-time PCR performed at the site.

3- Six (6)/10 STEC were also positive for E. coli 0157 by xTAG GPP. Sample remnants of all 10 STEC specimens were assessed by bi-directional sequencing for E. coli 0157 and the results added to those obtained for E. coli 0157.

Confirmatory testing by nucleic acid amplification followed by bi-directional sequencing using analytically validated primers was also conducted on all available specimens tested in the preselected arm of the clinical study. More specifically, confirmatory testing was performed for those analytes that were positive by xTAG GPP but not pre-selected at the banking site in order to determine whether these additional positive calls represented True Positive (TP) or False Positive (FP) clinical results. To the extent possible, sequencing primers targeted genomic regions distinct from those of the kit primers. xTAG GPP generated 114 additional positive calls (after allowable re-runs) for analytes that were not pre-selected at the banking site. Results of confirmatory testing from the preselected study were presented in the submission summary k121454, and the additional analyte results only are presented here. Sequencing primer validation studies were also presented in the submission summary k121454 and are not repeated here.

xTAG GPP detected a total of 71 mixed infections in the pre-selected arm of the clinical study. This represents $2 9 . 8 \%$ of the total number of xTAG GPP positive specimens (71/238). 56 $( 5 6 / 7 1 \colon 7 8 . 9 \% )$ were double infections, 14 $( 1 4 / 7 1 \colon 1 9 . 7 \% )$ were triple infections and 1 was quadruple infection $( 1 / 7 1 ; 1 . 4 \% )$ . The single most common co-infections (excluding E. coli 0157 with STEC; ${ N = } 1 2$ ) was ETEC with Shigella $( 6 / 7 1 ; 8 . 4 \% )$ . Out of the 71 co-infections, 25 contained one or more analytes that was not confirmed by bi-directional sequencing, i.e. discrepant co-infections. All mixed infection combinations detected by the reference/comparator methods were detected by xTAG GPP.

Supplemental Clinical Data (Simulated Stool Specimen Results) Due to difficulties in sourcing a sufficient number of retrospective stool specimens positive by reference method for Entamoeba histolytica and Vibrio cholerae, the performance of the xTAG GPP assay for these targets was further evaluated on contrived samples made using individual stool matrix spiked with varying levels of pathogen representing both the clinically relevant concentrations and concentrations that challenge the Limit of Detection (LoD) of the xTAG GPP assay. The results of testing are provided below (Table 37) and met study acceptance criteria.

Vibrio cholerae contrived stool specimens had $9 8 \%$ (49/50) concordance with the expected positive result. The one sample that did not call positive hand a signal of 91 MFI, which is near the positive call threshold of 150 MFI. The signal range for all Vibrio cholerae contrived stool specimens was 91 MFI – 2038 MFI; the signal range for the specimens which called positive for Vibrio cholerae was 834 MFI – 2038 MFI. All contrived negative stool specimens $( N = 5 0 )$ ) produced the expected negative result for all analytes. The internal control was present in all the negative contrived stool specimens and produced a signal range of 180 MFI – 1266 MFI.

Supplemental Clinical Data (Simulated Stool in Cary-Blair Specimen Results)

In order to assess whether Cary-Blair results generated for Adenovirus 40/41 in the prospective study were an accurate representation of the performance of xTAG GPP for this target, contrived specimens made from individual negative stool specimens in Cary-Bair were prepared at concentration spanning the analytical detection range of the assay and tested in a randomized fashion with negative specimens. Both Adenovirus 40 and 41 cultured isolates were tested and $50 \%$ of the samples were prepared at a concentration of 2XLoD. Results of this evaluation are presented in the table below.

In addition, due to the limited number of Entamoeba histolytica and Vibrio cholerae clinical samples available for testing during the clinical study, an additional study of contrived specimens in Cary-Blair was performed. A total of 150 stool in Cary-Blair contrived specimens consisting of 50 negative specimens, 50 specimens positive for Entamoeba histolytica and 50 specimens positive for Vibrio cholerae were analyzed with the xTAG GPP assay. Contrived specimens in Cary-Blair were prepared in the same manner as contrived stool specimens (see above). Results of this evaluation are summarized in the table below.

The clinical performance of xTAG GPP for Adenovirus 40/41, Rotavirus, ETEC, Cryptosporidium and Giardia was also evaluated in a set of pediatric stool specimens $\scriptstyle ( N = 3 1 3 )$ prospectively collected between February 2011 and January 2012 from symptomatic pediatric patients admitted to two referral hospitals in Botswana, Africa. All pediatric patients included in this evaluation presented with diarrhea and/or vomiting. All specimens were shipped frozen to a testing site located in Southern Ontario (Canada). As described and presented in k121454, comparator testing by nucleic acid amplification followed by bi-directional sequencing using analytically validated primers was performed on samples positive for Adenovirus 40/41, Rotavirus, ETEC, Cryptosporidium and Giardia by xTAG GPP. In order to minimize bias, a random subset of the Botswana cohort that tested negative by xTAG GPP was assessed by the same nucleic acid amplification followed by bi-directional sequencing method for Rotavirus, ETEC, Cryptosporidium and Giardia. In addition, all available clinical specimens $\scriptstyle ( N = 3 1 1 )$ were assessed for Adenovirus 40/41 using the same FDA-cleared EIA as that used in the prospective study (Premier Adenoclone Type 40/41 EIA, Meridian Bioscience, K881894). Results for Adenovirus are presented below. Results for other analytes were previously presented in the submission summary for k121454.

1 All 18 specimens that were positive for Adenovirus 40/41 by comparator but negative by xTAG GPP were positive by bidirectional sequencing only (i.e. FDA-cleared EIA negative). All these 18 specimens were assessed by real-time PCR for Adenovirus (all sub-types) at the laboratory testing site. The mean Ct value for these 18 specimens was 32.9; indicating low viral titer in these specimens, which is less clinically relevant.

2 All these 34 specimens were also assessed by real-time PCR for Adenovirus (all sub-types) at the laboratory testing site. In contrast to the 18 specimens in footnote 1 above, the mean Ct value for the 34 adenovirus samples positive by the PCR/Bidirectional sequencing assay and detected by xTAG GPP in this cohort was 22.81; indicating higher viral titer in these specimens, which is more clinically relevant.

3 222 of the comparator negative Adenovirus 40/41 specimens were assessed by FDA-cleared EIA only.   
4 Six out of a total of 313 samples tested by the xTAG GPP generated an “invalid” result for Adenovirus 40/41.

Nucleic acid amplification followed by bi-directional sequencing using analytically validated primers was also performed on all available clinical specimens that were positive by xTAG GPP for other analytes. The tables below summarize the confirmed xTAG GPP positive rate (i.e., confirmed xTAG GPP positives/all xTAG GPP positives) by PCR/bi-directional sequencing for Entamoeba Histolytica and Vibrio Cholerae. Results for Campylobacter, C. difficile Toxin A/B, E. coli O157, Norovirus, Salmonella, Shigella, and STEC were previously presented in the submission summary for k121454.

xTAG GPP detected a total of 110 mixed infections in the Botswana study. This represents $3 8 . 9 \%$ of the total number of xTAG GPP positive specimens (110/283). 8 1 (81/110; $7 3 . 6 \% )$ were double infections, 21 (21/110; 19.1%) were triple infections, 5 $( 5 / 1 1 0 ; 4 . 5 \% )$ were quadruple infections and 3 $( 3 / 1 1 0 ; 2 . 7 \% )$ were quintuple infections. The single most common co-infection was Rotavirus with Campylobacter $( 1 8 / 1 1 0 ; 1 6 . 4 \% )$ . Out of the 110 co-infections, 21 contained one or more analytes that was not confirmed by bi-directional sequencing, i.e. discrepant co-infections.

# Instrument and System Information

Luminex 100/200 with xPONENT Software

1. Modes of Operation: Batch

2. Software: Hazard Analysis included in submission documentation

3. Specimen Identification: Users must fill in Batch Information by providing a unique batch Name, Description and Creator. Users have to enter appropriate patient information, i.e. number of samples, and sample IDs.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling: DNA is extracted using the Biomérieux NucliSENS easyMAG system. Samples are manually prepared for amplification according to assay package insert and, once amplified, are transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate for analysis on the Luminex system.

5. Calibration: xMAP Calibrator Microspheres, Classification (CAL1) and Reporter (CAL2) serve as system calibrators for Luminex xMAP technology based detectors and are intended to normalize the settings for both the classification channel (CL1, CL2), the doublet discriminator channel (DD), and the reporter channel (RP1). They are not intended to be used as calibrators for a given assay.

6. Quality Control: xMAP Control Microspheres, Classification (CON1) and Reporter (CON2) are intended to verify the calibration and optical integrity for the Luminex 100/200 System.

Classification Control Microspheres verify both classification channels and the doublet discriminator channel (DD). Reporter Control Microspheres verify the reporter channel. They are not intended to be used as controls for a given assay which are described in the specific assay package insert.
