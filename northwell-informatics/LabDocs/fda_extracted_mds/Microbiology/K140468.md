DEVICE TRADE NAME:

BD Phoenix™M Automated Microbiology System - Ceftaroline $( 0 . 0 6 2 5 { \cdot } 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ EPY

DEVICE COMMON NAME:

Antimicrobial susceptibility test system-short incubation

DEVICE CLASSIFICATION:

21 CFR 866.1645   
Fully Automated Short-Term Incubation Cycle Antimicrobial Susceptibility System.   
(Product Code LON)

# PREDICATE DEVICES:

VITEK® System (PMA No. N50510)

# INTENDED USE:

The BD PhoenixTM Automated Microbiology System is intended for in vitro quantitative determination of antimicrobial susceptibility by minimal inhibitory concentration (MlC) of most Gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria isolates from pure culture for Enterobacteriaceae and NonEnterobacteriaceae and most Gram-positive bacteria isolates from pure culture belonging to the genera Staphylococcus, Enterococcus and Streptococcus.

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

The BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System (Phoenix System) is an automated system for the rapid identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of clinically relevant bacterial isolates. The system includes the following components:

BD Phoenix instrument and software. BD Phoenix panels containing biochemicals for organism ID testing and antimicrobial agents for AST determinations.   
• BD Phoenix ID Broth used for performing ID tests and preparing AST Broth inoculum. BD Phoenix AST Broth used for performing AST tests only. BD Phoenix AST Indicator solution added to the AST Broth to aid in bacterial growth determination.

The Phoenix panel is a sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene tray with 136 micro-wells containing dried reagents. Organisms for susceptibility testing must be a pure culture and preliminarily identified as a Gram-negative or Gram-positive isolate. Phoenix panels are inoculated with a specified organism density and placed into the instrument. Inoculum for use with the Phoenix system may be prepared either manually or may be automated using the BD Phoenix™M AP System.

The Phoenix AST method is a broth based microdilution test. The Phoenix System utilizes a redox indicator for the detection of organism growth in the presence of an antimicrobial agent. Measurements of changes to the indicator as well as bacterial turbidity are used in the determination of bacterial growth. Each AST panel configuration contains several antimicrobial agents with a wide range of two-fold doubling dilution concentrations.

The instrument houses the panels where they are continuously incubated at a nominal temperature of $3 5 ^ { \circ } \pm 1 ^ { \circ } C$ . The instrument takes readings of the panels every 20 minutes. The readings are interpreted to give an identification of the isolate, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values and category interpretations, S, I, R or N (susceptible, intermediate, resistant or not susceptible).

# DEVICE COMPARISON:

The BD Phoenix™M Automated Microbiology System demonstrated substantially equivalent performance for inoculum prepared manually and inoculum prepared with the BD Phoenix™M AP instrument when compared with the CLSI reference broth microdilution method. This premarket notification provides data supporting the use of the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System Gram positive ID/AST or AST only Phoenix panels with this antimicrobial agent.

# SUMMARY OF SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE TESTING:

The BD Phoenix™M Automated Microbiology System has demonstrated substantially equivalent performance when compared to the CLSI reference broth microdilution method (AST panels prepared according to CLSI M7). The system has been evaluated as defined in the FDA guidance document, "Class II Special Controls Guidance Document:Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA", August 28, 2009. Shelf life (stability data) for the drug is being collected and will be maintained on file at BD as indicated in the guidance document.

# Site Reproducibility

Intra- and inter-site reproducibility of this antimicrobial agent in the BD Phoenix System was evaluated at three sites using a panel of Gram-positive isolates. Each site tested the isolates in triplicate on three different days using one lot of Gram Positive Phoenix panels containing this antimicrobial agent and associated reagents.

The results of the study demonstrate that for this antimicrobial agent and the Gram-positive organisms tested there was an overall reproducibility across test sites of greater than 95% $( + 1 - 1$ dilution) agreement when compared to the test mode.

# Clinical Studies

Clinical, stock and challenge isolates were tested across multiple geographically diverse sites across the United States to demonstrate the performance of the Phoenix antimicrobial susceptibility test with a Gram Positive Phoenix Panel containing this antimicrobial agent. Phoenix System results for Challenge set isolates were compared to the expected results. Phoenix System results for clinical isolates were compared to the results obtained from the CLSl reference broth microdilution method.

The performance of the Phoenix System was assessed by calculating Essential Agreement (EA) and Category Agreement (CA) to expected/reference results for all isolates tested. Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when the BD Phoenix™M Automated Microbiology System agrees exactly or within one two-fold dilution to the reference result. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the BD PhoenixTM Automated Microbiology System agrees with the reference method with respect to the FDA categorical interpretive criteria (susceptible, intermediate, resistant or not susceptible).

The following table summarizes the performance for Clinical and Challenge isolates tested in this study.

# Conclusions Drawn from Substantial Equivalence Studies

The data collected from the substantial equivalence studies demonstrate that testing on the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System with this antimicrobial agent is substantially equivalent as outlined in the FDA guidance document, "Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA", August 28, 2009. Technological characteristics of this system are substantially equivalent to those used in the VITEK® system, which received approval by the FDA under PMA number N50510.
