# SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification OIR Review Memorandum (Decision Making Document is Attached)

To: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention RE: K140857

This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own Class II, Class III or Class I devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:

1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device. CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel 510(k): K132508

2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or promotional materials (labeling changes are permitted as long as they do not affect the intended use).

# 3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S):

The modification presented in this special 510(k) consisted of a revised package insert for the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel, Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Kit. Recently, additional assays have been included in the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel and cleared by FDA to accommodate the new influenza virus subtypes. The consumption of the various assays within the panel may be different since the prevalence of influenza virus types and subtypes vary from season to season. To address the consequent variation in consumption, CDC plans to provide the users with an option to order different configurations of specific components of the panel (including the Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Kit in this special 510(k)) so that their supply of reagents can be managed efficiently, minimizing the waste. The different components of CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel will be accompanied by revised labeling (package inserts) and the current submission is to clear another component, i.e., Influenza B Genotyping.

4. The FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.

# 6. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:

A “Declaration of Conformity” statement was submitted for the verification activities, and the manufacturing facility. The statement was signed by the Acting Branch Chief of the Virus Surveillance and Diagnostic Branch, CDC, and the Deputy Branch Chief, Division of Scientific Resources, CDC. The statement indicates:

# Verification Activities

To the best of my knowledge, the verification activities, as required by the risk analysis for the modification, were performed by the designated individual(s) and the results demonstrate the predetermined acceptance criteria were met.

# Manufacturing Facility

The CDC Division of Scientific Resources manufacturing facility is in conformance with the design control requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and the records are available for review.

In conclusion, the modified labeling is truthful and accurate. The changes do not affect the performance of the test and it is therefore substantially equivalent to the current cleared test.

7. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary or Statement and the Indications for Use Enclosure.

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.
