# B1. Device Name

Trade Name: VIDAS® H.pylori IgG   
Common Name: H.pylori IgG   
Classification name: Campylobacter fetus serological reagents   
Classification panel: Microbiology   
Governing Regulation: 21 CFR 866.3110   
Device Classification: Class I   
Product code: LYR

# C1. Predicate Device

VIDAS H.pylori IgG (K001460)

# D1. Device Description

The assay principle combines a 2-step enzyme immunoassay sandwich method with a final fluorescent detection (ELFA). All of the assay steps as well as the assay temperature are controlled automatically by the instrument. The Solid Phase Receptacle $( \mathsf { S P R @ } )$ serves as the solid phase as well as the pipetting device for the assay. Reagents for the assay are ready-to-use and predispensed in the sealed reagent strips. After preliminary wash and sample dilution steps, the sample is cycled in and out of the SPR for a specified length of time. IgG antibodies to H. pylori present in the specimen will bind to the H. pylori antigen coating the interior of the SPR. Unbound sample components are washed away.

Anti-human IgG antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase are cycled in and out of the SPR and will attach to any human IgG bound to the SPR wall. A final wash step removes unbound anti-human antibody conjugate. During the final detection step, the substrate (4 Methylumbelliferyl phosphate) is cycled in and out of the SPR. The conjugate enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of this substrate into a fluorescent product (4-Methylumbelliferone), the fluorescence of which is measured at $4 5 0 \ \mathsf { n m }$ . The intensity of fluorescence is measured by the optical scanner in the instrument. At the end of the assay, results are automatically calculated by the instrument, a test value is generated and a report is printed for each sample.

# C3. Predicate Device

VIDAS® Lyme IgG (K122986)

# D3. Device Description

The VIDAS Lyme IgG II assay principle combines a 2-step enzyme immunoassay sandwich method with a final fluorescent detection (ELFA) (see User’s Manual). The Solid Phase Receptacle $( \mathsf { S P R @ } )$ serves as the solid phase as well as the pipetting device for the assay. Reagents for the assay are ready-to-use and predispensed in the sealed reagent strips. All of the assay steps are performed automatically by the instrument. The reaction medium is cycled in and out of the SPR several times.

After a preliminary wash step and a sample dilution step, the antibodies to B. burgdorferi present in the specimen will bind to the B. burgdorferi specific recombinant proteins coating the interior of the SPR.

Unbound sample components are washed away. Antihuman IgG antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase, will attach to the immunocomplex bound to the SPR wall.

A final wash step removes unbound conjugate. During the final detection step, the substrate (4- Methylumbelliferyl phosphate) is cycled in and out of the SPR. The conjugate enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of this substrate into a fluorescent product (4-Methylumbelliferone) the fluorescence of which is measured at $4 5 0 \mathsf { n m }$ . The intensity of the fluorescence is proportional to the quantity of anti-B. burgdorferi IgG antibody present in the sample.

At the end of the VIDAS Lyme IgG II assay, results are automatically calculated by the instrument. A test value is generated and a report is printed.

# E3. Intended Use

The VIDAS Lyme IgG II (LYG) assay is an automated qualitative enzyme immunoassay intended for use on the instruments of the VIDAS family in the presumptive detection of human IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in human serum (plain or separation gel) or plasma (sodium heparin or lithium heparin). It should be used to test patients with a history and/or symptoms of infection with B. burgdorferi. All VIDAS Lyme IgG II positive specimens should be further tested with a Western Blot IgG assay to obtain supportive evidence of infection with B. burgdorferi.

This device is an in vitro diagnostic medical device for professional use only.

# C4. Predicate Device

VIDAS® RUB IgG (K080766)

# D4. Device Description

The VIDAS $\circled{8}$ RUB IgG (RBG) assay is an enzyme-linked fluorescent immunoassay (ELFA) that consists of a two step enzyme immunoassay sandwich method and a fluorescent detection. A pipette tip-like disposable device, the Solid Phase Receptacle $( \mathsf { S P R @ } )$ , serves as the solid phase as well as a pipettor for the assay. Reagents for the assay are ready-to-use and are provided in sealed reagent strips. All assay steps are automated by the instrument. The assay reactions take place by pipetting up and down with the SPR through the wells of the reagent strip. The sample is initially diluted, and follows a first incubation step in the SPR, where anti-Rubella IgG antibodies present in the sample bind to the rubella antigen coating the interior of the SPR. After a wash step to eliminate any unbound component, a second incubation is performed using a monoclonal anti-human IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate. Following another wash step, the detection substrate (4-methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate) is added to the SPR.

The enzyme conjugate catalyzes the hydrolysis of the substrate into a fluorescent product (4-methylumbelliferone), and its fluorescence is measured by the instrument. The intensity of the fluorescence is proportional to the concentration of rubella antibodies present in the sample. Results are automatically determined by the instrument based on the stored calibration curve and according to the CLS $\textsuperscript { \small { | \textregistered } }$ I/LA6-A recommended cut-off of 10 IU/mL. The assay is calibrated against the WHO 1st International Standard for anti Rubella Immunoglobulin, Human (1997).

# E4. Intended Use

The VIDAS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ RUB IgG (RBG) assay uses Enzyme Linked Fluorescent Assay (ELFA) technology on the instruments of the VIDAS family for the in vitro quantitative and qualitative measurement of IgG antibodies to rubella virus in human serum. The VIDAS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ RUB IgG (RBG) assay is intended as an aid in the determination of immune status to rubella. The performance of this device has not been established for screening of cord blood, or for neonatal samples. Likewise, performance characteristics of the assay have not been established for immunocompromised or immunosuppressed individuals.

This device is an in vitro diagnostic medical device for professional use only.

# Detection Limits

The detection limits of the VIDAS RUB IgG assay on the VIDAS 3 were evaluated per CLSI EP17-A2 “Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline, Second Edition”. For LoB determination, 6 blank samples were each tested in 4 replicates in a single run per day for 4 days with 1 VIDAS 3 instrument and 2 assay lots. For LoD/LoQ determinations, 6 low-level samples were each tested in 6 replicates, 2 runs per day, for 5 days, with 1 VIDAS 3 instrument and 2 assay lots. The LoB, LoD and LoQ determinations were based consequently on 912 results, including 192 results from blank samples and 720 results from low-level samples both assay lots combined. The LoB, LoD, LoQ of the VIDAS RUB IgG assay on the VIDAS 3 are as follows: L $\mathsf { \Lambda } _ { 2 } \mathsf { B } = 0 . 3 8 9$ IU/mL; LoD $=$ 0.595 IU/mL; $\mathsf { L o Q } = 0 . 6 0 8 \mathsf { \Pi } | \mathsf { U } / \mathsf { m L }$ .

# Assay Performance Testing using a CDC Panel

A CDC low-titer rubella antibody standard and a CDC reference panel (CDC RUB IgG serum panel) was tested using the VIDAS RUB IgG assay on the VIDAS 3 system and on the VIDAS system.

# CDC low-titer rubella antibody standard results:

Vials of CDC low-titer reference standard were reconstituted with distilled water as preconized by CDC and then pooled as MSN (Master Stock Neat). According to the CDC information, the theoretical dose of the neat solution was 21 IU/mL. A $\%$ dilution solution was then prepared from the MSN solution and had an expected dose at $1 0 . 5 \ : | \mathsf { U } / \mathsf { m L }$ .

The neat and $_ { 1 / 2 }$ dilutions solutions of the CDC low titer standard (MSN & MS1/2 solutions) were then tested in triplicate in the same run on the VIDAS and the VIDAS 3 instruments using the same VIDAS RUB IgG reagent lot.

The mean result $( | \mathsf { U } / \mathsf { m } | )$ obtained with the neat and $_ { 1 / 2 }$ dilutions of the CDC low-titer standard and the difference in $\%$ compared to the theoretical/expected concentration of CDC low-titer standard were calculated for the VIDAS and the VIDAS 3:

for VIDAS 3, the mean value of the neat and $\%$ dilution were respectively $- 1 1 . 0 \%$ and $- 1 1 . 4 \%$ compared to the theoretical concentration.   
for VIDAS, the mean value of the neat and $\%$ dilution were respectively $- 1 5 . 7 \%$ and $- 7 . 6 \%$ compared to the theoretical concentration.

# CDC reference panel testing, data analysis and results:

The CDC reference panel consisted of 100 specimens, 50 pairs of sera titered by Hemagglutination Inhibition (9 negative sera resulting in 18 negative specimens and 41 positive sera resulting in 82 positive specimens). A single replicate of each of the 100 CDC reference panel samples was tested on the VIDAS and the VIDAS 3 instruments using the same VIDAS RUB IgG reagent lot.

The number of positive and negative sera detected are identical between VIDAS and VIDAS 3 systems: The VIDAS RUB IgG (RBG) assay identified 80/82 $( 9 7 . 6 \% )$ positive tests on 82 positive sera and 18/18 $( 1 0 0 \% )$ negative tests on 18 negative sera. One of the pairs of HI positive sera was reported as VIDAS equivocal (both results).

C5. Predicate Device VIDAS® TOXO M (K923166)

# D5. Device Description

The VIDAS TOXO IgM (TXM) assay is an enzyme-linked fluorescent immunoassay (ELFA) that is performed in an automated instrument. All assay steps and assay temperature are controlled by the instrument. A pipette tip-like disposable device, the Solid Phase Receptacle $( \mathsf { S P R @ } )$ , serves as the solid phase as well as the pipettor for the assay. The SPR is coated with goat anti- $\mu$ chain antibodies. The VIDAS TOXO IgM (TXM) assay configuration prevents nonspecific reactions with the SPR.

Reagents for the assay are in the sealed TXM Reagent Strips. After a sample dilution step, the sample is cycled in and out of the SPR for a specified length of time. IgM antibodies present in the specimen will bind to the anti- $\mu$ chain antibodies coating the interior of the SPR. Unbound sample components are washed away. An immunocomplex of T. gondii antigen and mouse monoclonal anti-P30 antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase is cycled in and out of the SPR and will attach to the human anti-T. gondii IgM bound to the SPR wall (Note: P30 is a major surface protein of the T. gondii tachyzoite, with molecular weight of 30,000 (5)). A final wash step removes unbound conjugate.

A fluorescent substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate, is introduced into the SPR. Enzyme remaining on the wall of the SPR will catalyze the conversion of the substrate to the fluorescent product, 4-methylumbelliferone. The intensity of the fluorescence is measured by the optical scanner in the instrument.

When the VIDAS TOXO IgM (TXM) assay is completed, the results are analyzed automatically by the instrument, a test value is generated, and a report is printed for each sample.

# E5. Intended Use

The VIDAS $\textcircled{8}$ TOXO IgM (TXM) assay is intended for use on the instruments of the VIDAS family (VITEK $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ImmunoDiagnostic Assay System) as an automated enzyme-linked fluorescent immunoassay (ELFA) for the presumptive qualitative detection of anti-Toxoplasma gondii IgM antibodies in human serum, as an aid in the diagnosis of acute, recent, or reactivated Toxoplasma gondii infection. This assay must be performed in conjunction with an anti-Toxoplasma gondii lgG antibody assay. VIDAS TOXO IgM (TXM) assay performance has not been established for prenatal screening or newborn testing. This assay has not been cleared by the FDA for blood/plasma donor screening.

# Linearity

Three sample pools were serially diluted into a total of 11 samples and tested in triplicate in order to evaluate the linearity according to CLSI EP06-A “Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach”. The VIDAS HCG assay on VIDAS 3 is linear across the measuring range $2 \mathrm { - } 1 5 0 0 \mathrm { m } | \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L }$ .

# Detection Limits

The detection limits of the VIDAS HCG assay on the VIDAS 3 were evaluated per CLSI EP17-A2 “Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline, Second Edition”. For LoB determination, 6 blank samples were each tested in 4 replicates in a single run per day for 4 days with 1 VIDAS 3 instrument and 2 assay lots. For LoD/LoQ determinations, 6 low-level samples were each tested in 6 replicates, 2 runs per day, for 5 days, with 1 VIDAS 3 instrument and 2 assay lots. The LoB, LoD and LoQ determinations were based consequently on 912 results, including 192 results from blank samples and 720 results from low-level samples both assay lots combined. The LoB, LoD, LoQ of the VIDAS HCG assay on the VIDAS 3 are as follows: LoB = 0.242 mIU/mL; LoD = 0.571 mIU/mL; $\mathsf { L o Q } = 1 . 2 8 0 \mathsf { m l U / m L }$ .

# Carry-over

One high HCG positive sample was tested with one HCG batch analyte negative sample and one carry-over analyte negative sample during 7 runs on 3 VIDAS 3 instruments until 84 replicates of each sample was obtained. The average carry-over observed on VIDAS 3 and its $9 5 \%$ confidence interval were calculated and compared to a $\mathtt { < 5 }$ PPM (parts per million) acceptance criteria. The capacity of VIDAS 3 to not generate Carry-Over was demonstrated.

# Dilution

Four samples (human serum pool) with the following approximate HCG concentrations 6 000, 25 000, 75 000, and $1 5 0 0 0 0 \mathrm { \ m U / m L }$ , were tested on two VIDAS 3 systems using an automated dilution sequence and a manual dilution sequence. For the automated dilutions, eleven (11) dilution levels ranging from $1 / 1$ to $1 / 1 0 0 0$ were tested per sample. For the manual dilutions, two dilution levels were defined and tested per sample.

For each sample, each system and each dilution ratio, the average relative difference between the observed HCG concentration (automatic testing) and the estimated theoretical HCG concentration (manual testing) is estimated as follow:

Relative diff. $( \% ) = 1 0 0 \times$ (Observed dose – Theoretical dose) / Theoretical dose.

At a global level, the global average relative difference observed per dilution ratio ranges from $- 3 . 1 \%$ to $+ 9 . 4 \%$ .

# H6. Conclusion

The results for the performance testing submitted in this premarket notification are complete and demonstrate that the VIDAS HCG Assay is substantially equivalent to the predicate device identified in Item C6 of this summary. The addition of the VIDAS 3 instrument to the VIDAS Family does not affect the safety and effectiveness of the Reagent kit.

C7. Predicate Device VIDAS® T4 (K926393)

# D7. Device Description

The VIDAS T4 (T4) assay is an enzyme-linked fluorescent immunoassay (ELFA) that is performed in an automated instrument. All assay steps and assay temperature are controlled by the instrument. A pipette tip-like disposable device, the Solid Phase Receptacle (SPR), serves as a solid phase for the assay as well as a pipetting device. At the time of manufacture, the SPRs are coated with mouse monoclonal anti-T4 antibodies. The VIDAS T4 (T4) assay configuration prevents nonspecific reactions with the SPR. Reagents for the assay are in the sealed T4 Reagent Strips. The sample is transferred into the well containing the T4 antigen conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. The conjugate solution also contains ANS and sodium salicylate, which liberate bound T4 from the carrier proteins in the sample.

The sample/conjugate mixture is cycled in and out of the SPR and the T4 in the sample competes with the T4-alkaline phosphatase conjugate for binding with the mouse monoclonal anti-T4 antibodies coated on the SPR. Wash steps remove unbound conjugate. A fluorescent substrate, 4- methylumbelliferyl phosphate, is cycled in and out of the SPR. Enzyme remaining on the SPR well will catalyze the conversion of the substrate to the fluorescent product 4-methylumbelliferone $( 4 5 0 \ \mathsf { n m } )$ . The intensity of fluorescence is measured by the optical scanner in the instrument. It is inversely proportional to the T4 concentration present in the sample. When the VIDAS T4 (T4) is completed, the results are analyzed automatically by the instrument, and a report is printed for each sample.

# E7. Intended Use

The VIDAS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ T4 (T4) assay is intended for use on the instruments of the VIDAS family as an automated quantitative enzyme-linked fluorescent immunoassay for the determination of human thyroxine (T4) concentration in serum or plasma (heparin). It is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disorders.

This device is an in vitro diagnostic medical device for professional use only.

# Linearity

One sample pool was serially diluted into a total of 11 samples and tested in triplicate in order to evaluate the linearity according to CLSI EP06-A “Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach”. The VIDAS T4 assay on VIDAS 3 is linear across the measuring range $6 - 3 2 0 { \mathsf { n m o l } } / \mathsf { L }$ .

# Detection Limits

The detection limits of the VIDAS T4 assay on the VIDAS 3 were evaluated per CLSI EP17-A2 “Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline, Second Edition”. For LoB determination, 6 blank samples were each tested in 4 replicates in a single run per day for 4 days with 1 VIDAS 3 instrument and 2 assay lots. For LoD/LoQ determinations, 6 low-level samples were each tested in 6 replicates, 2 runs per day, for 5 days, with 1 VIDAS 3 instrument and 2 assay lots. The LoB, LoD and LoQ determinations were based consequently on 912 results, including 192 results from blank samples and 720 results from low-level samples both assay lots combined. The LoB, LoD, LoQ of the VIDAS T4 assay on the VIDAS 3 are as follows: LoB $=$ 1.596 nmol/L; LoD = 3.749 nmol/L; $\mathsf { L o Q } = 6 . 2 1 6 \mathsf { n m o l / L }$ .

# H7. Conclusion

The results for the performance testing submitted in this premarket notification are complete and demonstrate that the VIDAS T4 Assay is substantially equivalent to the predicate device identified in Item C7 of this summary. The addition of the VIDAS 3 instrument to the VIDAS Family does not affect the safety and effectiveness of the Reagent kit.

# C8. Predicate Device

VIDAS® Testosterone (K021326)

# D8. Device Description

The assay principle combines an enzyme immunoassay competition method with a final fluorescent detection (ELFA). The Solid Phase Receptacle (SPR®), serves as the solid phase as well as the pipetting device for the assay. Reagents for the assay are ready-to-use and predispensed in the sealed reagent strips. All of the assay steps are performed automatically by the instrument. The reaction medium is cycled in and out of the SPR several times. The sample is taken and transferred into the well containing the conjugate which is an alkaline phosphatase-labeled testosterone derivative. The testosterone present in the serum and the testosterone derivative in the conjugate compete for the antitestosterone specific antibody sites coated to the inner surface of the SPR. Unbound components are eliminated during the washing steps.

During the final detection step, the substrate (4-Methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate) is cycled in and out of the SPR. The conjugate enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of this substrate into a fluorescent product (4-Methyl-umbelliferone), the fluorescence of which is measured at $4 5 0 \ \mathsf { n m }$ . The intensity of the fluorescence is inversely proportional to the concentration of testosterone present in the sample. At the end of the assay, results are automatically calculated by the instrument in relation to the calibration curve stored in memory, and then printed out.

# E8. Intended Use

The VIDAS Testosterone (TES) assay is an automated quantitative test for use on the instruments of the VIDAS family for the enzyme immunoassay measure of total testosterone in human serum or plasma (lithium heparin), using the ELFA technique (Enzyme Linked Fluorescent Assay). It is intended as an aid in the diagnosis and management of conditions involving excess or deficiency of this androgen.

This device is an in vitro diagnostic medical device for professional use only.

C9. Predicate Device VIDAS® TSH (K921816)

# D9. Device Description

The VIDAS TSH (TSH) assay is an enzyme-linked fluorescent immunoassay (ELFA) that is performed in an automated instrument. All assay steps and assay temperature are controlled by the instrument. A pipette tip-like disposable device, the Solid Phase Receptacle $\mathsf { ( S P R ^ { \otimes } ) }$ , serves as a solid phase for the assay as well as a pipetting device. The SPR is coated at the time of manufacture with mouse monoclonal anti-TSH antibodies. The VIDAS TSH (TSH) assay configuration prevents nonspecific reactions with the SPR. Reagents for the assay are located in the sealed Reagent Strips. The sample is transferred into the well containing anti-TSH antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. The sample/conjugate mixture is cycled in and out of the SPR and the TSH will bind to antibodies coated on the SPR and to the conjugate forming a "sandwich". Wash steps remove unbound conjugate. A fluorescent substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate, is cycled through the SPR. Enzyme remaining on the SPR wall will catalyze the conversion of the substrate to the fluorescent product 4- methylumbelliferone. The intensity of fluorescence is measured by the optical scanner in the instrument ; it is proportional to the TSH concentration present in the sample.

When the VIDAS TSH (TSH) assay is completed, the results are analyzed automatically by the instrument, and a report is printed for each sample.

# E9. Intended Use

The VIDAS $\textcircled{8}$ TSH (TSH) assay is intended for use on the instruments of the VIDAS family as an automated quantitative enzyme-linked fluorescent immunoassay (ELFA) for the determination of human thyroid stimulating hormone- (TSH) concentration in human serum or plasma (heparin). It is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of thyroid or pituitary disorders.

# Linearity

Four sample pools were serially diluted into a total of 8 samples and tested in triplicate in order to evaluate the linearity according to CLSI EP06-A “Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach”. The VIDAS TSH assay on VIDAS 3 is linear across the measuring range $0 . 0 5 - 5 7 \mu \mathrm { | U / m L }$ .

# Detection Limits

The detection limits of the VIDAS TSH assay on the VIDAS 3 were evaluated per CLSI EP17-A2 “Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline, Second Edition”. For LoB determination, 6 blank samples were each tested in 4 replicates in a single run per day for 4 days with 1 VIDAS 3 instrument and 2 assay lots. For LoD/LoQ determinations, 6 low-level samples were each tested in 6 replicates, 2 runs per day, for 5 days, with 1 VIDAS 3 instrument and 2 assay lots. The LoB, LoD and LoQ determinations were based consequently on 912 results, including 192 results from blank samples and 720 results from low-level samples both assay lots combined. The LoB, LoD, LoQ of the VIDAS TSH assay on the VIDAS 3 are as follows: LoB = 0.019 µIU/mL; LoD/LoQ = 0.05 µIU/mL.

# H9. Conclusion

The results for the performance testing submitted in this premarket notification are complete and demonstrate that the VIDAS TSH Assay is substantially equivalent to the predicate device identified in Item C9 of this summary. The addition of the VIDAS 3 instrument to the VIDAS Family does not affect the safety and effectiveness of the Reagent kit.

# C10. Predicate Device

VIDAS® D-Dimer Exclusion II (K112818)

# D10. Device Description

The VIDAS D-Dimer Exclusion II (DEXII) assay is an enzyme-linked fluorescent immunoassay (ELFA) performed in an automated instrument. All assay steps and assay temperature are controlled by the instrument. A pipette tip-like disposable device, the Solid Phase Receptacle (SPR), serves as a solid phase for the assay as well as a pipetting device. The SPR is coated at the time of manufacture with anti-Fibrin degradation product (FbDP) monoclonal antibodies. The VIDAS D-Dimer Exclusion II assay configuration prevents nonspecific reactions with the SPR. Reagents for the assay are located in the sealed Reagent Strips. The sample is transferred into the well containing an alkaline phosphataselabeled anti-FbDP monoclonal antibody.

The sample/conjugate mixture is cycled in and out of the SPR and the antigen will bind to antibodies coated on the SPR and to the conjugate forming a "sandwich". Wash steps remove unbound conjugate. A fluorescent substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate, is cycled through the SPR. Enzyme remaining on the SPR wall will catalyze the conversion of the substrate to the fluorescent product 4-methylumbelliferone. The intensity of fluorescence is measured by the optical scanner in the instrument; it is proportional to the D-Dimer concentration present in the sample. When the VIDAS DDimer Exclusion II assay is completed, the results are analyzed automatically by the instrument, and a report is printed for each sample.

# E10. Intended Use

VIDAS $\textcircled{8}$ D-Dimer Exclusion ${ | | \mathsf { T M } }$ is an automated quantitative test for use on the instruments of the VIDAS family for the immunoenzymatic determination of fibrin degradation products (FbDP) in human plasma (sodium citrate, CTAD) using the ELFA technique (Enzyme Linked Fluorescent Assay). VIDAS D-Dimer Exclusion II is indicated for use in conjunction with a clinical pretest probability assessment model to exclude deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) disease in outpatients suspected of DVT or PE.

This device is an in vitro diagnostic medical device for professional use only.
