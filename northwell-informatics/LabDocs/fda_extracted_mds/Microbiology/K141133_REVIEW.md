# L. Test Principle:

# VIDAS 3

The technology used, which is adaptable to a wide range of assays, combines the EIA method with a final fluorescence reading: this technology is known as ELFA (Enzyme Linked Fluorescent Assay). The enzyme used in the VIDAS product range is alkaline phosphatase, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of the substrate 4-methyl umbelliferyl phosphate (4-MUP) into a fluorescent product 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) the fluorescence of which is measured at $4 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . The immunological methods are either indirect EIA, immunocapture, sandwich or competition, all involving a conjugate using the alkaline phosphatase.

# CDC low-titer rubella antibody standard results:

Vials of CDC low-titer reference standard were reconstituted with distilled water as preconized by CDC and then pooled as MSN (Master Stock Neat). According to the CDC information, the theoretical dose of the neat solution was $2 1 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ . A $\%$ dilution solution was then prepared from the MSN solution and had an expected dose at $1 0 . 5 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

The neat and 1/2 dilutions solutions of the CDC low titer standard (MSN & MS1/2 solutions) were then in triplicate in the same run on the VIDAS and the VIDAS 3 instruments using the same VIDAS RUB IgG reagent lot.

The mean result $\mathrm { ( I U / m L ) }$ ) obtained with the neat and 1/2 dilutions of the CDC lowtiter standard and the difference in $\%$ compared to the theoretical/expected concentration of CDC low-titer standard were calculated for the VIDAS and the VIDAS 3:

For VIDAS 3, the mean value of the neat and $\%$ dilution was respectively - $- 1 1 . 0 \%$ and $- 1 1 . 4 \%$ compared to the theoretical concentration.   
For VIDAS, the mean value of the neat and $\%$ dilution was respectively $- 1 5 . 7 \%$ and $- 7 . 6 \%$ compared to the theoretical concentration.

# CDC reference panel testing, data analysis and results:

The CDC reference panel consisted of 100 specimens, 50 pairs of sera titered by Hem agglutination (9 negative sera resulting in 18 negative specimens and 41 positive sera resulting in 82 positive specimens). A single replicate of each of the 100 CDC reference panel samples was tested on the VIDAS and the VIDAS 3 instruments using the same VIDAS RUB IgG reagent lot.

The number of positive and negative sera detected are identical between VIDAS and VIDAS 3 systems: The VIDAS RUB IgG (RBG) assay identified 80/82 $( 9 7 . 6 \% )$ positive tests on 82 positive sera and 18/18 $( 1 0 0 \% )$ negative tests on 18 negative sera. One of the pairs of HI positive sera were reported as VIDAS equivocal (both results).

The VIDAS HCG assay on VIDAS 3 is linear across the measuring range $2 - 1 5 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$

Linear regression analysis between the expected values and the observed values generated the following equation: $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 6 0 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 1 0 9$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 7 7$ (Sample range tested from 1.95 - 1607.99 mIU/mL)

An additional study was performed to assess the automated dilution capability of the VIDAS 3 by comparing doses obtained with automated dilution on VIDAS 3 to theoretical doses estimated using manual dilutions. The study was reviewed and found to be acceptable.

# d. Detection limit:

The detection limits of the VIDAS HCG assay on the VIDAS 3 were evaluated per CLSI EP17-A2 “Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline, Second Edition”. For LoB determination, 6 blank samples were each tested in 4 replicates in a single run per day for 4 days with 1 VIDAS 3 instrument and 2 reagent lots. For LoD/LoQ determinations, 6 low-level samples were each tested in 6 replicates, 2 runs per day, for 5 days, with 1 VIDAS 3 instrument and 2 reagent lots. The Lo B , Lo D a n d L o Q d e t e r m i n a t i o n s were b a s e d consequently on 912 results, including 192 results from blank samples and 720 results from low-level samples both reagent lots combined. The LoB, LoD, LoQ of the VIDAS HCG assay on the VIDAS 3 are as follows: $\mathrm { L o B } = 0 . 2 4 2 \ : \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ ; $\mathrm { L o D } { = } 0 . 5 7 1 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ ; $\mathrm { L o Q } = 1 . 2 8 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ .

1. Analytical performance: VIDAS D-Dimer Exclusion II

# Precision

Four plasma samples covering the analytical measurement range of the VIDAS $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ DDimer Exclusion $\operatorname { I I I M }$ assay were tested in duplicate, twice a day, over six days. Testing was performed using one reagent lot across three instruments at one testing site. A total of 144 measurements with 72 measurements per type of system (VIDAS and VIDAS 3) were generated for each sample. The precision results on the VIDAS 3 system are summarized as follows:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

# Linearity

Linearity was evaluated according to CLSI EP06-A “Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach”. Two high concentration samples were serially diluted into 11 and 15 samples, respectively, and tested in three runs with one replicate per run on the VIDAS 3 system. At each tested concentration, deviation from linearity was within the predetermined acceptance criterion of $\pm 1 2 \%$ . The VIDAS $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ D-Dimer Exclusion $\operatorname { I I I M }$ assay on the VIDAS 3 system was determined to be linear across the measuring range, $4 5 { - } 1 0 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The detection limits of the VIDAS $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ D-Dimer Exclusion $\operatorname { I I I M }$ assay on the VIDAS 3 instrument were evaluated per CLSI EP17-A2 “Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline, Second Edition”. For LoB determination, six blank samples were each tested in four replicates in a single run per day. Testing was performed over four days with one VIDAS 3 instrument and two assay reagent lots. For LoD/LoQ determinations, six low-level samples were each tested in six replicates per run, two runs per day. Testing was completed over five days with one VIDAS 3 instrument and two assay reagent lots.

# Method Comparison

A study was conducted to verify the agreement of the $\mathrm { \Delta V I D A S @ }$ D-Dimer Exclusion $\operatorname { I I I M }$ assay on the VIDAS 3 instrument with the same assay on the VIDAS $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ instrument. A total of 221 human plasma samples (209 patient samples and 12 contrived samples) were tested in singlicate with both systems. Sample concentrations covered the ranges of $6 1 . 1 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ to $8 9 7 6 . 3 1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ Fibrinogen Equivalent Unit (FEU) and $6 7 . 5 2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ to $9 3 8 0 . 7 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ FEU for the VIDAS 3 and VIDAS systems, respectively. Two samples with observed results outside the assay measuring range were excluded from the data analysis. Both Passing & Bablok regression and Weighted Deming regression were performed between the results observed on the VIDAS 3 and the VIDAS systems and are summarized in the table below:
