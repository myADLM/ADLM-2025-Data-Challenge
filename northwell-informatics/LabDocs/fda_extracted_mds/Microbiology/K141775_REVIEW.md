# I. Device Description:

The Sofia® Strep $\mathbf { A } ^ { + }$ FIA is a lateral flow immunofluorescence-based assay encased in a 2-D barcoded cassette. Antigen-extracted specimen is applied to the sample pad through a sample port, which is wicked through photoresistant europium chelate-impregnated polystyrene microparticles coated with polyclonal primary antibodies to Streptococcus pyogenes antigens, then through a localized stripe of secondary antibodies (Strep A Line), followed by a reference stripe that acts as a procedural control zone and reference line. The test is designed to reduce autofluorescence background by using a large Stokes shift from 365 to $6 1 8 \mathrm { n m }$ . Once the barcode is scanned with the external barcode analyzer, the cassette is uni-directionally inserted into an analyzer drawer in the front of the apparatus. The Sofia® analyzer scans the region of the test strip containing the Strep A and Reference lines in the result window to yield three possible results: 1) Positive for Strep A, 2) Negative for Strep A, 3) Invalid. Europium chelate is detected by a scanning optics unit, exciting by a $3 6 5 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ filtered LED (Light Emitting Diode) and captured by a filtered photodiode, converted from analog RFU (Relative Fluorescence Units) data to digital.

A positive result for the analyte is determined by detection and analysis of the fluorescent signal at the test and reference lines, which are processed by an assay-specific algorithm. The algorithm employs a smoothing algorithm to the data, identifies peak maxima, minima and width, then calculates the RFU value based on peak height for the Strep A test line. The Limit of Blank (LoB) is 1948 RFU. When the test line value is $\geq 1 9 4 8$ RFU, the test result is positive; when the value is $< 1 9 4 8$ RFU, the test results is negative. The procedural control zone cutoff for a valid versus invalid result is 30,000 RFU. If internal controls fail at any point, the result is invalid and an error code is presented. Results are presented on a screen and can be printed on an integrated printer (optional). The Sofia® analyzer has the capacity to operate in Read-Now Mode and WalkAway Mode; however Read-Now Mode functionality has been disabled for this the Sofia® Strep $\mathrm { A } { + } \mathrm { F I A }$ .

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

# L. Test Principle:

Analyte detection from the chemically lysed swab specimen with the lateral flow device begins with the pipetting of the extracted clinical sample into the test cassette’s sample port and onto the sample pad, after which the sample is drawn by capillary action into and through the label pad, through the nitrocellulose strip and into the absorbent pad. The specimen interacts with distinct chemical environments as the fluid migrates along the course of the lateral flow device. Within the label pad, the specimen comes into contact with antibodies that have been coupled to the europium chelate-impregnated microbeads. During this interaction, the beads coated with anti-GAS polyclonal antibodies bind corresponding GAS carbohydrate antigens that are present in the specimen. The bead-coupled antigenantibody complexes then begin to flow through the test strip. As they migrate on, if GAS antigens are present in the sample, they and the fluorescent beads to which they are bound will be subsequently captured on the surface of the nitrocellulose by the respective locationfixed, anti-GAS-specific capture antibodies. The flow and capture of the fluorescent microbeads coated with GAS antigens allows the accumulation of a fluorescent signal at the specific analyte line location on the test strip. Upon completion of the test, the Sofia® analyzer scans the test strip and objectively interprets the assay result. There are three possible results: (1) positive for Strep A; (2) negative for Strep A; and (3) invalid. It is

important to point out that the fluorescence signals obtained with this assay are invisible to the unaided eye. The test results can only be obtained with the proper use of the Sofia® analyzer. This ensures fully objective interpretation of the test result.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# 1. Analytical performance:

All analytical studies were conducted in Read-Now Mode with the exception of the reproducibility studies, which were conducted with the Walk-Away mode. Although the Read-Now Mode is not available in this version of the device, this feature was unlocked in order to simplify testing. The primary difference between these modes is that in ReadNow Mode, the operator is responsible for the incubation time; in the Walk-Away Mode, the instrument will wait to read the strip until the specified development time has passed. A validation study was conducted to demonstrate that the Read-Now Mode does not impact the results of the analytical studies in the conditions tested. See section M.3.c below for more information and the results of this study.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Specimens for precision and reproducibility studies were prepared by re-suspending each cultured strain in a contrived negative matrix, freezing until testing then diluting the strain to the indicated concentration in the table below. The rayon swab that is provided with the assay was inoculated with a fixed volume of the stock and run with the Sofia® Strep $\mathbf { A } ^ { + }$ FIA. The LoD values were based on the values obtained in the LoD study. See section ${ \bf M } . 2 . b$ below for details on the matrix equivalency and freezethaw study.

The reproducibility of the Sofia® Strep $\mathbf { A } ^ { + }$ FIA was evaluated at three (3) laboratory sites (two external, one in-house) on six (6) different analyzers. Reproducibility was assessed using a panel of four (4) simulated samples in negative clinical matrix that include negative, high negative, low positive and moderate positive GAS. The panels and controls were processed and tested on the Sofia® Strep $\mathbf { A } ^ { + }$ FIA at each site by 2 operators for 5 non-consecutive days over 2 weeks on 6 different instruments in Walk-Away Mode (2 operators x 3 replicates x 5 days x 3 sites $= 9 0$ results per concentration). The reproducibility study results are acceptable. The results are shown in the Table I below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The Sofia® Strep $\mathbf { A } ^ { + }$ FIA has an internal a procedural control zone used to monitor sample processing and evaluate the presence of inhibitory substances or inadequate specimen preparation. External controls are used to confirm the integrity of assay reagents and cassette detection. The external quality controls used in these studies were positive control swabs spiked with heat inactivated, GAS cells and negative control swabs spiked with Group C Streptococcal antigen. The positive control serves as both a processing and extraction control. The positive and negative external control isolates were tested each day during the clinical studies.

Specimen stability studies demonstrated that contrived specimens were stable when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or $2 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 96 hours. These studies were conducted with negative matrix and positive contrived specimens at $2 . 4 \ : \mathrm { x }$ LoD in replicates of six (6) per condition on a single instrument for 0, 6, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours.

Additional temperature studies were conducted with negative matrix and positive contrived specimens at $1 . 6 \mathrm { x }$ LoD in replicates of ten (10) per condition on ten (10) different instruments. These studies were conducted for 30 minutes at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $2 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and at $3 7 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ .

Extracted specimens were demonstrated to be stable for up to 24 hours at $2 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Studies were conducted with negative matrix and positive contrived specimens at 1.6 x LoD in replicates of 5 (five) per condition for 0, 1 and 30 minutes, 1, 2, 6 and 24 hours on six (6) different instruments.

Data was provided to demonstrate that the Sofia Strep $\mathbf { A } ^ { + }$ FIA can be operated at temperatures between $1 5 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { C } \cdot 3 1 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { C }$ . These studies were conducted with negative matrix and positive contrived specimens at $1 . 6 \mathrm { x }$ LoD in replicates of ten (10) per condition on a single instrument at $1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $2 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $3 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

An inter-analyzer study demonstrated that results did not vary between instruments. These studies were conducted with negative matrix and positive contrived specimens at $1 . 6 \mathrm { ~ x ~ L o D }$ using ten (10) analyzers in replicates of 20 for positive specimens and 10 for negative specimens.

The studies above meet or exceed the requirements in the labeling.

All controls performed as expected for all stability studies.

These study results are acceptable.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of detection (LoD) of the Sofia® Strep $\mathbf { A } ^ { + }$ FIA was determined using contrived stocks of three (3) strains of GAS which were prepared per the protocol in M.1.a. The LoD was defined as the point at which at least $9 5 \%$ of all replicates tested positive $( \mathrm { C } _ { 9 5 } )$ . Preliminary testing was conducted to identify the approximate threshold for negative and positive detection for each strain. Low-positive $\left( \mathrm { C } _ { 5 0 } \right)$ testing was then conducted with 60 replicates per strain. Dose-response curves were then generated to interpolate the expected LoD concentration for each strain. For each strain, the LoD was validated with 20 replicates. The LoD study results are shown in Table II below.

These study results are acceptable.

# e. Analytical Sensitivity:

Inclusivity studies were conducted with twenty-one (21) GAS strains in replicates of twenty (20) per strain at approximately $_ { 2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } }$ LoD $( 5 . 8 \mathrm { \ : { \fontfamily { ' } \selectfont { N } } } 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { C F U / m l } )$ on with five (5) different instruments against three (3) different reagent lots. Each cultured strain was

prepared per the protocol described above in $\mathrm { M } . 1 . a$ above. The inclusivity study results and the final organism concentrations tested are shown in Table III below. All GAS strains were correctly detected by the assay ( $100 \%$ detected).

\* Adenovirus Type 4 was tested at $4 . 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 3 } \mathrm { P F U / m l }$ ; The Epstein Barr Virus was tested only with genomic copies at $4 . 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ copies/ml.

None of the eighty-eight (88) organisms cross-reacted at the concentrations tested.

# ii. Microbial Interference:

Interference studies were conducted with each of the eighty-eight (88) microorganisms listed above in Table IV. Each organism was tested in replicates of five (5) at clinically relevant levels of viruses $( \bar { 1 } . 0 \mathrm { { x } 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { { p f u / m l } } }$ or the highest achievable concentration) and bacteria $( 1 . 0 \mathrm { { x } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { { c f u } / m L ) } }$ in the presence of $1 . 6 \mathrm { x }$ LoD Group A Streptococcus ATCC 19615. All strain combinations were spiked into contrived negative matrix, prepared per the protocol described above in M.1.a above.

Eleven (11) of the eighty-eight (88) tested microorganisms that might be found in throat specimens interfered with the assay. When interference was observed, follow-up tests were conducted to assess the level of interference at other organism concentration levels. Results are shown in Table V below:

No interference was observed in follow-up studies conducted at higher concentration (0/20).

\*\*\* Interference was observed in follow-up studies conducted at higher concentration for Group D (2/45) and Group F (6/90).

\*\*\*\* No interference was observed in follow-up studies (0/5).

\*\*\*\*\* Studies conducted at reduced concentration of the interfering organism did not demonstrate interference.

iii. Interfering Substances:

Twenty-five (25) chemical and biological substances were evaluated for potential to cross-react and interfere with the Sofia® Strep $\mathbf { A } ^ { + }$ FIA, including fresh whole human blood, bovine submaxillary mucin and some snack foods that contain specimen-thickening substances. Each substance was tested in replicates of five (5) or more using $1 . 6 \mathrm { x }$ LoD Group A Streptococcus ATCC 19615, prepared per the protocol described above in M.1.a. Two (2) of the substances tested demonstrated a potential to cause false negative results, as shown in Table VI below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>Table VI: Interfering Substances</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Strains</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Interference Frequency*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Human Whole Blood 100μl/swab**</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1/5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Bovine Submaxillary Mucin, 28.7 mg/ml</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1/10</td></tr></table>

\* #false negative results/total # tests at that concentration. \*\* Concentrations $\le 7 5 \mu 1$ whole blood/swab did not interfere. 2/5 results were invalid.

No cross-reactivity was observed with any of the chemical or biological substances. Of the snack foods tested, Nacho Flavor Doritos at $2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / m l }$ increased the viscosity of the specimens which reduced the flow and sample volume, leading to invalid results 4/10 times in cross-reactivity studies. No interference was observed at $1 2 5 \mathrm { m g / m l }$ . Interferents were noted in the limitations section in labeling.

These study results are acceptable.

g. Assay cut-off:

The Limit of Blank (LoB) is 1948 RFU is the cutoff for this assay, which is the numerical threshold that is used to distinguish negative from positive. The procedural control zone cutoff for a valid versus invalid result is 30,000 RFU.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable.

b. Matrix comparison:

The analytical performance studies above were conducted in a contrived negative matrix that included bovine serum albumin and sodium azide with protocol that included a freeze-thaw step. In order to demonstrate that the results of analytical studies conducted in the contrived negative matrix are comparable to studies

conducted in the presence of a clinical matrix, a study was conducted to compare the following two conditions:

1) fresh bacteria spiked into a negative clinical matrix (pharyngeal swabs from patients) 2) spiked specimens prepared using a contrived negative the sample preparation protocol provided in the submission, which includes a freeze-thaw step

This study was conducted by testing twenty replicates each of four (4) different concentrations of Streptococcus pyogenes (Table VII) for each of the three (3) strains used to determine the LoD. All testing was conducted in Walk-Away Mode.

These studies demonstrate that the contrived negative matrix and freeze-thaw step does not alter the performance of the device in comparison to studies conducted in a clinical matrix. These study results are acceptable.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity:

Performance characteristics of the Sofia® Strep $\mathbf { A } ^ { + }$ FIA were established during a prospective study conducted from April to May 2014. Eight hundred and sixty (860) fresh, throat swab specimens from female and male patients were prospectively collected and transported to each laboratory for testing with the Sofia® Strep $\mathbf { A } ^ { + }$ FIA at seven (7) distinct geographical sites across the United States. All testing was done at laboratories holding a certificate of waiver. Three swab specimens were simultaneously collected were collected using the rayon throat swabs provided with the assay. One (1) was used for clinical testing, the second was used for Sofia® Strep $\mathbf { A } ^ { + }$ FIA testing and the third was shipped on ice in transport media to a central reference laboratory for culture and discrepant analysis using an FDA-cleared polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. All eight hundred and sixty (860) fresh throat specimens were cultured for Group A $\beta$ -hemolytic Streptococcus (GAS) and tested with the Sofia® Strep $\mathbf { A } ^ { + }$ FIA. The specimen was considered positive if culture was positive for Group A $\beta$ -hemolytic Streptococcus. Two (2) results were determined to be invalid in these studies. Seven (7) additional results were excluded due to the lack of valid external controls on the same day of running.

Bacterial culture was performed at the central reference laboratory where specimens were plated on GAS selective agar with $5 \%$ sheep’s blood. Plates were cultured at $3 7 ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } } }$ C with $5 \% \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ and examined for the presence of $\beta$ -hemolytic colonies at twenty-four (24) hours. If no $\beta$ -hemolytic colonies were observed, the plates were placed at room temperature and cultured aerobically for another twenty-four (24) hours. All $\beta .$ - hemolytic colonies positive culture plates were tested for catalase and confirmed for the presence of GAS using the FDA-cleared Streptex® Rapid Agglutination Test for identification of Lancefield groups A, B, C, D, F and G streptococci.

The clinical performance of the Sofia® Strep $\mathbf { A } ^ { + }$ FIA was demonstrated with eight hundred and fifty-one (851) prospectively collected fresh throat specimens at seven sites across the United States. The breakdown of performance for the Sofia® Strep $\mathbf { A } ^ { + }$ FIA is summarized in Table VIII below:

The external quality controls used in these studies were: 1) Positive control consisting of swabs spiked with heat inactivated, Group A Streptococcus cells and 2) Negative control consisting of swabs spiked with Group C Streptococcal antigen. The positive control serves as both a processing and extraction control. Positive and negative external controls were tested each day during the clinical studies. Of 253 Group A Streptococcus positive controls tested, 250 $( 9 8 . 8 \% )$ were detected accurately. Of the three (3) incorrect results, two (2) were positive upon retesting and one (1) was not retested. Of the 253 Group C Streptococcus negative controls tested, 253 $( 9 8 . 8 \% )$ were detected accurately. Of the three (3) incorrect results, all three (3) were negative upon retesting. Results from clinical specimens were included for evaluation of study performance only if valid positive and negative external control results were attained on the same day.

These study results are acceptable.

b. Clinical specificity:

See table above.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

See section M.1 above for more information about why this study was conducted.

To demonstrate that performance of the Sofia® Strep $\mathbf { A } ^ { + }$ FIA is not influenced by operating the device in Read-Now Mode under the conditions used for analytical studies, a comparison study was conducted with ten (10) replicates of one (1) strain for each of three (3) concentrations of GAS on five (5) Sofia® analyzers (5 analyzers $\textbf { \scriptsize x } 1 0$ replicates $= 5 0$ tests/concentration).
