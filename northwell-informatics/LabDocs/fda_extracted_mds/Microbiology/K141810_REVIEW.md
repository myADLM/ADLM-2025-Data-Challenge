# I. Device Description:

The blood sample to be tested is inoculated into one or more vials which are inserted into the BACTEC fluorescent series instrument for incubation and periodic reading. Each vial contains a chemical sensor which can detect increases in $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ produced by the growth of microorganisms. The sensor is monitored by the instrument every ten minutes for an increase in its fluorescence, which is proportional to the amount of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ present. A positive reading indicates the presumptive presence of viable microorganisms in the vial. Detection is limited to microorganisms that will grow in a particular type of medium.

# L. Test Principle:

The BD BACTEC Plus Anaerobic/F medium is an enriched soybean- casein digest broth, with each vial containing $3 0 \mathrm { m L }$ of broth. Sodium polyanetholesulfonate (SPS) is added to the medium as an anticoagulant that inhibits bacteriocidal activities in the blood. The concentration of SPS has been optimized to accommodate blood volumes of up to $1 0 \mathrm { m L }$ per vial.

Each BD BACTEC Plus Anaerobic/F blood culture medium vial contains a chemical sensor in a silicon rubber base that can detect increases in CO2 produced by the growth of microorganisms. Three to $1 0 \mathrm { m L }$ of blood is inoculated into the BD BACTEC Plus Anaerobic/F blood culture medium vial, which is inserted into the BD BACTEC Fluorescent Series instrument for incubation, agitation and periodic measurement. When microorganisms are present in the blood sample, they metabolize nutrients in the culture medium, releasing CO2 into the medium. A dye in the sensor reacts with the CO2, modulating the amount of light that is absorbed by the fluorescent material in the sensor. The instrument’s photo detectors monitor the sensor every 10 minutes and measure the level of fluorescence, which is proportional to the amount of CO2 present in the vial. Positivity of a vial is determined by algorithms resident in the instrument rack’s microprocessor. The algorithms use the rate of CO2 production as well as the absolute increase in CO2 to interpret the data.

Culture vials flagged as presumptively positive are removed from the instrument for subculture and Gram stain in order to identify the microorganisms for further evaluation and proposed patient treatment. Culture vials that are not flagged as positive remain in the instrument until the test protocol has been completed and negative bottles are discarded at the end of protocol (120 hours).

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The BACTEC Plus Anaerobic/F (Plastic) vial was evaluated across three lots in the Time To Detection and the Percent Recovery (Sensitivity) studies. For study details, please see section 1.d and 2.a below. Different lots of key raw materials were used to manufacture each lot of culture media. The results stratified by lot (combining blood volumes, inoculum levels, organisms, and instruments) are shown in Table 1. The precision data for the 10-100 CFU inoculum levels stratified by instrument type (combining blood volumes, organisms, and lots) are shown in Table 2.

Table 1: Precision data by lot- positive percent and median Time to Detection (TTD)

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Plasticlot</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Percent ofresultspositive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Median TTD(hours)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3220225</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>78.21%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>13.2922</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3220228</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>78.21%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>12.8469</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3220230</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>80.71%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>13.4590</td></tr></table>

The lot-to-lot difference results were:

· Percent of samples with positive results by all three lots $= 7 2 . 8 6 \%$ Percent of samples with positive results only by two lots $= 5 . 0 0 \%$ Percent of samples with positive results only by one lot $= 8 . 5 7 \%$ · Percent samples with negative results by all three lots $= 1 3 . 5 7 \%$

The analysis was acceptable and there was no statistically significant difference across the lots in the precision study.

# Quality Control

An internal validation study across three lots with inoculum of ${ < } 1 0 0$ CFU/vial was conducted using the organisms listed below. Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis were evaluated with nine vials each; S. pneumoniae, E. coli, Bacteroides vulgatus, and S. aureus were evaluated with eight vials each. Clostridium histolyticum was evaluated in the Time to Detection study of 24 replicates. All the following organisms were detected $\leq 7 2$ hours:

Clostridium histolyticum ATCC 19401   
Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124   
Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 6305   
Bacteroides fragilis\* ATCC 25285   
E. coli ATCC 25922   
Bacteroides vulgatus ATCC 8482   
Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923

\* CLSI recommended strain d. Detection limit:

# Microbial Detection Limit (target inoculum level 0- 1, 1- 10 CFU/vial)

The microbial detection limit study was conducted to assess the capability of the culture media to detect low numbers of organisms (expected target level of 0-1 and 1- 10 CFU/vial) when present in blood. The study included 13 organisms (six anaerobes and seven facultative anaerobes) tested at two blood volumes, each at challenging target inoculum levels of 0-1and 1-10 CFU/vial across three lots with BACTEC FX and BACTEC 9240:

13 organisms $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ blood vol. x 2 inoculum vol. x 3 lots x 2 instrument types $= 3 1 2$

The results stratified by organism (combining blood volumes, inoculum levels, lots and instruments) are shown in Table 3. The results stratified by inoculum level (combining organisms, blood volumes, lots and instruments) are shown in Table 4.

In summary, the study did not support the claim for target inoculum levels of 0-1 or 1-10 CFU/vial for either type of vials because the percent recovery was less than $50 \%$ at 0-1 CFU/vial, and less than $9 5 \%$ for plastic and $90 \%$ for glass vials at target level of 1-10 CFU/vial. Because of the risk associated with bloodstream infections, the expected percent recovery is close to $100 \%$ for blood culture devices. Therefore, the claim for the BD BACTEC Plus Anaerobic $/ \mathrm { F }$ (plastic) was 10-100 CFU/vial as demonstrated in the Percent Recovery study below (Tables 7, 8, and 9).

e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

Performance of the BD BACTEC Plus Anaerobic/F (plastic) blood culture vials was evaluated in a seeded internal analytical studies to demonstrate comparable performance to the predicate device, the BD BACTEC Plus Anaerobic/F (glass) blood culture vials. Comparison results were acceptable. The comparisons were made using the following parameters: Time to detection, percent recovery, false negative rate, false positive rate, and antimicrobial neutralization capability.

For comparison of time to detection, percent recovery, and false negative rate studies, $9 5 \%$ two-sided bootstrap confidence intervals for differences were used for the statistical analysis.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

# Instrument Time to Detection (TTD) study

The TTD analysis was evaluated in the percent recovery study with 442 pairs of both glass positive and plastic positive results at inoculum level of 10-100 CFU/vial, two blood volumes of $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ and $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ , across three lots and by four instruments. The study demonstrated the following:

i. Plastic vial median TTD: 16.696 hours ii. Glass vial median TTD: 16.773 hours iii. Difference in median TTD (Plastic-Glass): -0.0776 hours

The data indicated that the new device (plastic vial) was 4.62 minutes faster than the predicate device (glass vial). The new device performed equivalently when compare to the predicate device.

The data also indicated that the performance for different blood volumes, $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ and 10 mL were the same. The TTD results for the 10-100 CFU inoculum levels stratified by lot (combining blood volumes, organisms, and instruments) are shown in Table 5. The percent recovery results for the 10-100 CFU inoculum levels stratified by instrument type (combining blood volumes, organisms, and lots) are shown in Table 6 below.

# Percent Recovery study

The percent recovery was evaluated in a study of 528 paired sets at the inoculum of 10- 100 CFU/vial on four instruments across three lots using a diverse set of microorganisms frequently isolated in blood. Of the 528 paired sets, 442 sets recovered organisms in both the plastic vial and the glass vial and 70 were negative by both vials. Fourteen paired sets were recovered in the plastic vials but not in the glass vials and two were recovered in the glass vials but not in the plastic vials. Petptostreptococcus anaerobius and Finegoldia magna (formerly Peptostreptococcus magnus) were not recovered in the plastic or glass vials (Table 7). Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus was recovered at the rate of $2 9 \%$ in plastic but $12 \%$ in glass. These organism groups were included in the limitation section of the package insert (PI). The organisms recovered at lower than $9 5 \%$ in plastic were Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium nucleatum and were noted in the performance characteristics of the PI.

The percent recovery results for the 10-100 CFU inoculum levels stratified by organism (combining blood volumes, lots, and instruments) are shown in Table 7. The percent recovery results for the 10-100 CFU inoculum levels stratified by lot (combining blood volumes, organisms, and instruments) are shown in Table 8 below. The results demonstrated no significant difference between the plastic vials and the glass vials.

# False Positive Rates

False positivity was assessed with vials inoculated with fresh human blood of 2, 4, 6, and $8 \mathrm { m L }$ , but no organisms were added to the vials. There were 240 pair sets across three lots using BACTEC FX and BACTEC 9240. The false positive rate was $0 . 4 2 \%$ (1/240) for the glass vials and $0 \%$ (0/240) for plastic vials. These results demonstrated no significant difference between the plastic vials and the glass vials.

# False Negative Rates (Instrument-negative, subculture positive)

A false negative is a vial that was instrument-negative at the end of protocol (120 hours) yet contains viable organisms upon subculturing onto appropriate culture media. There were a total of 146 paired sets where both the new and the predicate devices were negative at 120 hours; there were 30 sets where the predicate device only detected (i.e. 30 plastic vials subcultured) and 67 vials where the new device detected (i.e. 67 glass vials subcultured)

$$
( 1 4 6 \times 2 ) + 3 0 + 6 7 = 3 8 9
$$

Of the 389 instrument-negative vials, 16 were subculture positive; two were from the plastic vials while 14 were from the predicate (glass) vials. The two false negative from the plastic device were Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus at inoculum level of 10- 100 CFU/vial, and Porphyromonas asccharolytica (formerly Bacteroides melaninogenicus subspp. asaccharolyticus) at inoculum level of 0-1 CFU/vial.

The false negative of Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus and Porphyromonas asccharolytica were included in the limitation and performance characteristics sections of the PI respectively. These results demonstrated no significant difference between the plastic vials and the glass vials.

# BACTEC Instrument Compatibility

A total of 132 paired sets at 10-100 CFU/vial were evaluated across four instruments comprising of BACTEC 9050, 9240, FX, and FX40 in the percent recovery study. Twenty-two organisms were evaluated with both $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ and $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ blood. The performance for different blood volumes, $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ and $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ , were the same.

The percent recovery results for the 10-100 CFU inoculum levels stratified by instrument (combining organisms, blood volumes, and lots are shown in Table 9. These results demonstrated no significant difference between the plastic vials and the glass vials.

22 organisms $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ blood vol. x 3 lots $= 1 3 2$ $1 3 2 \mathrm { x } 4$ instruments $= 5 2 8$

# Antimicrobial Neutralization Capability

The study was to demonstrate the nonionic and cationic resins in the culture media to enhance the recovery of anaerobes by adsorption of commonly used antibiotics in the blood samples. The antibiotics evaluated were Ciprofloxacin, Cefazolin, Cefotaxime, Cefepime, Cefoxitin, Clindamycin, Gentamicin, Meropenem, Metronidazole, Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Vancomycin.

The study included testing for anaerobes in which each tested anaerobe was susceptible to the antibiotic concentration inoculated into the culture vial at 10-100 CFU/vial, $7 \mathrm { m L }$ of blood and across three lots by BACTEC FX. Meropenem susceptible Clostridium perfringens was not recovered in glass or plastic vials, across three lots when tested at susceptible MIC level in the vials. The result is noted in the performance characteristics section of the PI. The performance is listed in Table 10 below. These results demonstrated no significant difference between the plastic vials and the glass vials.

# N. Instrument Name:

BACTEC FX, FX40, BACTEC 9240, and BACTEC 9050

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

BACTEC Plus Anaerobic/F culture bottles are for use with the BACTEC 9000 series, BACTEC FX, and BACTEC FX40 instruments. The BACTEC blood culture system is an automated microbiology growth and detection system designed to detect microbial growth from blood specimens. When microorganisms are present in culture vials, they metabolize nutrients in the culture medium, releasing carbon dioxide into the medium. A dye in the sensor at the bottom of the vial reacts with $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ which modulates the amount of light that is absorbed by a fluorescent material in the sensor. A photo detector at each station measures the level of fluorescence, which corresponds to the amount of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ released by organisms.

2. Software:
