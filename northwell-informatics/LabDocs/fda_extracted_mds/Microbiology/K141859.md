Device Name CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel, Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit

Indications for Use (Describe)   
The Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit contains reagents and controls of the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT  
PCR Diagnostic Panel and is intended for use in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays on an Applied Biosystems (ABI)   
7500 Fast Dx Real Time PCR Instrument in conjunction with   
clinical and epidemiological information:

• For the presumptive identification of virus in patients who may be infected with influenza A subtype A/H5(Asian Lineage) from viral RNA in human respiratory specimens and viral culture in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors; • To provide epidemiologic information for surveillance of circulating influenza viruses.

Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a season when seasonal influenza viruses A/H1 and A/H3 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation and during a season when the A/ H1pdm09 influenza virus was the predominant influenza A virus in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary with other emerging influenza A viruses.

Testing with the influenza H5a and H5b primer and probe sets should not be performed unless the patient meets the most current U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) clinical and epidemiological criteria for testing suspect A/H5 specimens. The definitive identification of influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) either directly from patient specimens or from virus cultures requires additional laboratory testing, along with clinical and epidemiological assessment in consultation with national influenza surveillance experts.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

All users, analysts, and any person reporting results from use of this device should be trained to perform and interpret the results from this procedure by a competent instructor prior to use. CDC Influenza Division will limit the distribution of this device to only those users who have successfully completed a training course provided by CDC instructors or designees.

Predicate Device CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (K132508)

# Device Description

The Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit contains components of the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel that is used in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument. The Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit consists of oligonucleotide primers and dual-labeled hydrolysis (TaqMan®) probes to be used in rRT-PCR for the in vitro qualitative

detection and characterization of human influenza viruses from viral RNA in respiratory specimens from patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI).

The Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit is based on technology which is used in many molecular diagnostic assays. rRT-PCR assays are one-tube assays that first reverse-transcribe specific regions of RNA into cDNA copies. The cDNA then serves as a template for a polymerase chain reaction that utilizes a thermocyclic heating and cooling of the reaction to logarithmically amplify a specific region of DNA. The probe anneals to a specific internal target sequence located between the target loci of the forward and reverse primers. During the extension phase of the PCR cycle, the $5 "$ nuclease activity of Taq polymerase degrades any probe molecules hybridized to amplified target sequence, causing the reporter dye to separate from the quencher dye, and generating a fluorescent signal. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes, increasing the fluorescence intensity. Fluorescence intensity is monitored at each PCR cycle. Amplification of targets is reflected by logarithmic increase in fluorescence over time in comparison to the background signal.

# Intended Use

The Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit contains reagents and controls of the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel and is intended for use in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information:

For the presumptive identification of virus in patients who may be infected with influenza A subtype A/H5(Asian Lineage) from viral RNA in human respiratory specimens and viral culture in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors; To provide epidemiologic information for surveillance of circulating influenza viruses.

Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a season when seasonal influenza viruses A/H1 and A/H3 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation and during a season when the A/H1pdm09 influenza virus was the predominant influenza A virus in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary with other emerging influenza A viruses.

Testing with the influenza H5a and H5b primer and probe sets should not be performed unless the patient meets the most current U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) clinical and epidemiological criteria for testing suspect A/H5 specimens. The definitive identification of influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) either directly from patient specimens or from virus cultures requires additional laboratory testing, along with clinical and epidemiological assessment in consultation with national influenza surveillance experts.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted unless a BSL $3 +$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

All users, analysts, and any person reporting results from use of this device should be trained to perform and interpret the results from this procedure by a competent instructor prior to use. CDC Influenza Division will limit the distribution of this device to only those users who have successfully completed a training course provided by CDC instructors or designees.
