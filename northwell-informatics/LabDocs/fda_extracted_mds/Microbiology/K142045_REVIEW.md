# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The Cepheid Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay is an automated, multiplex real-time, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay intended for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) viral RNA. The Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay uses nasopharyngeal swab and nasal aspirate/wash specimens collected from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infections in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.

Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2013-2014 influenza season. When other novel influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

# Ancillary Specimen Collection Kit

Xpert® Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit The Xpert Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit is designed to collect, preserve and transport nasopharyngeal swab specimens and to preserve and transport nasal aspirate/wash specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection prior to analysis with the Xpert Flu Assay or the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay.

The Xpert Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit has only been cleared for use with the Xpert Flu Assay and Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assays.

# I. Device Description:

The Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay is a rapid, automated in vitro diagnostic test for qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert Instrument Systems (GeneXpert Dx systems and GeneXpert Infinity Systems). The GeneXpert Instrument System platform automates and integrates sample purification, nucleic acid amplification, and detection of the target sequence in simple or complex samples using real-time PCR and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays. The systems require the use of single-use disposable cartridges (the Xpert Flu/RSV XC cartridges) that hold the PCR reagents and host the PCR process. Because the cartridges are self-contained and specimens never come into contact with working parts of the instrument modules, cross-contamination between samples is minimized.

The single-use, multi-chambered fluidic cartridges are designed to complete sample preparation and real-time RT-PCR for detection and differentiation of influenza A, influenza B and RSV viral RNA in approximately 60 minutes or less. The GeneXpert Instrument Systems, comprised of the GeneXpert Dx Systems and the GeneXpert Infinity Systems, have 1 to 80 randomly accessible modules, depending upon the instrument, that are each capable of performing separate sample preparation and realtime PCR and RT-PCR tests. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids (i.e., the syringe drive activates the plunger that works in concert with the rotary valve in the cartridge to move fluids between chambers), an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or spores, and a proprietary I-CORE® thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and RT-PCR and detection.

Specimens are collected following the user’s institution standard procedures for collecting NA/W specimens and NP swab specimens for influenza and RSV testing.

The Cepheid Xpert Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit or Cepheid’s Sample Collection Kit are required for the assay but not provided in the kit.

# Quality Control

The Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay includes reagents for the detection and differentiation of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV viral RNA directly from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and nasal aspirate/wash (NA/W) specimens collected from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. A Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) are also included in the cartridge. The SPC is an armored RNA pseudovirus present to control for adequate processing of the target viruses and to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the PCR reaction. It is composed of RNA fragments which do not share any homology to assay gene targets. The Probe Check Control (PCC) verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity and dye stability.

# Results Interpretation

The Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay has two channels (Flu A 1 and Flu A 2) to detect most influenza A strains. The primers and probes in the Flu A 1 channel have $100 \%$ homology to human influenza A strains. The primers and probes in the Flu A 2 channel have approximately $80 \%$ homology to human influenza A strains. All influenza A strains detected by the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay are reported as Flu A POSITIVE.

The results are interpreted by the GeneXpert Instrument System from measured fluorescent signals and embedded calculation algorithms and will be shown in the View Results window. All possible results are shown in Table 1.

# L. Test Principle:

The Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay utilizes automated real-time reverse-transcription   
polymerase   
chain reaction (RT-PCR) for unique gene-specific sequence amplification and $5 ^ { \circ }$ end   
cleavage   
of hybridized, fluorogenic target-specific probe for the detection of amplified cDNA of the

RNA targets. The primers and probes in the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay are designed to amplify and detect unique sequences in the genes which encode for the following proteins: Flu A Matrix (M), Flu A Basic Polymerase (PB2), Flu A Acidic protein (PA), Flu B Matrix (M), Flu B Non-Structural protein (NS), and the RSV A and RSV B Non-Structural proteins. A Sample Processing Control (SPC) verifies adequate lysis of the target virus and sample processing, and detects assay interference. The SPC is mixed with the sample automatically inside the test cartridge to control for adequate sample processing and to monitor the integrity of the RT-PCR assay. Sample organism and SPC are lysed using an ultrasonic device on-board the GeneXpert Instrument. A pump dispenses fluid to and from different cartridge chambers and the PCR and RT-PCR amplification and fluorophore detection occur within the I-CORE module of the instrument.

# Reproducibility

A panel of 10 specimens with varying concentrations of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV was tested on ten different days by two different operators, at each of three sites (10 specimens x 1 time/day $\textbf { x } 1 0$ days x 2 operators x 3 sites). Each site used a different GeneXpert Instrument (running the same analytical software) for the analysis. The reproducibility and precision study specimen panel consisted of one seasonal influenza A strain (Flu A/Perth/16/09), one influenza B strain (Flu B/Wisconsin/01/2011), and one respiratory syncytial virus (RSV-A/2/Australia/61) strain. Virus strains were prepared in a simulated matrix: $( 2 . 5 \%$ (w/v) porcine mucin, $1 \% \mathrm { ( v / v ) }$ human whole blood in $0 . 8 5 \%$ sodium chloride (NaCl) formulated in a 1X PBS solution with $1 5 \%$ glycerol). Each virus strain was prepared at three concentration levels: a “high negative” sample with an analyte concentration below the limit of detection, a “low positive” sample with an analyte concentration approximately 1x the limit of detection, and a “moderate positive” sample with an analyte concentration approximately $2 \mathbf { x }$ the limit of detection. Negative samples included in the study were comprised of the simulated background matrix only. One lot of Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay cartridges was used at each of the 3 testing sites. The Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay was performed according to the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay procedure. For the preparation of the precision panel and reproducibility panels, Cepheid established panel concentration levels and expected results for panel members at those concentrations. This information is summarized in Table 3 below. Reproducibility results are summarized in Table 4.

During the panel preparation, it was noted that the final concentration of the Mod Positive panel members were closer to $2 \mathbf { x }$ LoD than 3X LoD, but still within the overall targeted range. The reproducibility of the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay was also evaluated in terms of the fluorescence signal expressed in Ct values for each target detected. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) between-sites, between-days, and between-operators for each panel member are presented in Table 5. One replicate was performed per day per operator, therefore, operator and assay (within-run) precision are confounded.

# Instrument System Precision

An in-house precision study was conducted to compare the performance of the GeneXpert Dx and the GeneXpert Infinity instrument systems and to provide supplemental information to the reproducibility of the assay. A panel of 10 specimens with varying concentrations of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV was tested on 12 different days by two operators. Each operator conducted four runs of each panel specimen per day on each of the two instrument systems (10 specimens x 2 times/ day x 12 days $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ operators $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ instrument systems). Three lots of Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay cartridges were used for the study. The Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay was performed according to the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay procedure. Results are summarized in Table 6.

The data demonstrated acceptable reproducibility as it $\mathrm { s h o w s } \geq 9 5 \%$ detection of all analytes at the moderate positive level on all three instruments. Detection of low positive specimens (1x LoD) $\mathrm { w a s } \geq 9 0 \%$ for influenza B and RSV and $8 8 . 0 \%$ for influenza A. Due to the relatively low LoD concentrations for RSV and Flu A, it is believed that small variations in sample aliquots contributed to detection levels below the anticipated $9 5 \%$ .

# External Controls

ZeptoMetrix inactivated virus controls: (catalog # NATFLUAB-6C and catalog # NATRSV-6C) are external positive controls required for the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay.

ZeptoMetrix (catalog # NATCXVA9-6C) is an inactivated Coxsackie virus external negative control required for the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay.

# Shipping and Storage Stability

Storage conditions were evaluated for nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens and nasal aspirate/wash (NA/W) specimens during the period between collection and processing on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems. A specimen stability study was conducted to establish transport and storage claims for specimens to be analyzed with the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay. The following transport media were included in this study: Becton Dickinson Universal Viral Transport Medium (UVTM), Remel M5 Transport Medium, Copan Universal Transport Medium (UTM). Positive and negative specimens were included in the study. Positive specimens consisted of one seasonal Flu A strain (A/H3/Victoria/361/2011), one Flu B strain (B/Wisconsin/01/11), and one RSV strain (RSV-A/Long/MD/56) spiked at $2 \mathbf { x }$ the LoD into a simulated matrix. Negative specimens consisted of the simulated matrix only.

Aliquots of each positive and negative specimen were stored at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to represent the limits of the recommended refrigerated storage temperature range and at $1 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to represent the limits of the recommended room temperature storage temperature range. Replicates of 8 positive specimens and replicates of 4 negative specimens were tested at $\mathrm { T } { = } 0$ , 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, and 8 days for $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Replicates of 8 positive specimens and replicates of 4 negative specimens were also tested at $\mathrm { T } { = } 0$ , 4 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours for $1 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . For extreme storage conditions, aliquots of each positive and negative specimen were stored refrigerated at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 7 days. Specimens were then transferred to $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and stored for 24 hours and then tested on day 9 with the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay. These conditions represent the extremes of all recommended storage temperatures and storage times. Replicates of 8 positive specimens and replicates of 4 negative specimens were tested at $\mathrm { T } { = } 0$ and 9 days.

One replicate each of three external controls (one Flu A/B positive, one RSV positive and one negative) was tested with the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay on each day of the study. All positive and negative specimens at all storage conditions and temperatures tested were correctly identified using the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay. The study supports the recommended specimen storage conditions at refrigerated $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ temperatures for up to seven days and at room temperature $( 1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for up to 24 hours until testing is performed on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems for all three transport media types: Becton Dickinson UVTM, Remel M5, and Copan UTM. The study also supports specimen stability at an extreme storage temperature and storage time (7 days at $2 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ followed by 24 hours at $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , and tested on day 9) for all three transport media.

# Specimen Stability – Cartridge Hold Time Study

Xpert Flu/RSV XC samples that are prepared for testing on a GeneXpert Infinity System may wait up to four hours for a GeneXpert module to become available after the cartridge is loaded onto the System. During this wait time, the target viral particles may degrade or become unstable such that a low positive signal is rendered “NEGATIVE” by the Xpert Flu/RSV Assay. A Cartridge Hold Time Study was performed to determine an acceptable maximum hold time for the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay between sample addition and cartridge processing.

One lot of the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay was subjected to a sample hold time study where the sample was added to cartridges to be held at three storage conditions (ambient, $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 7 5 \%$ relative humidity, and $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and processed at scheduled hourly time intervals ranging from 0-5 hours. “Ambient” storage condition refers to the controlled temperature of the open laboratory set to $7 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 2 2 . 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ) { \pm } 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ . Chambers set to $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ with $7 5 \%$ relative humidity and $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ were monitored continuously as part of Cepheid’s automated temperature monitoring and access control system.

\* Flu A $( 8 + )$ , Flu B $( 8 + )$ , and RSV $( 8 + )$ 8 replicates tested each; (8-) 8 negative samples tested.

Under the conditions of this study, positive and negative viral samples were stable up to five hours between sample addition and cartridge processing under all storage conditions tested. The data supports the claim to begin the test within 60 minutes of adding the specimen to the cartridge.

# Limit of Detection (LoD)

LoD was established using two influenza A H3N2 strains, two influenza A 2009 H1N1 strains, two influenza B strains, two respiratory syncytial virus A (RSV A) strains, two respiratory syncytial virus B (RSV B) strains, and one influenza A H7N9 strain diluted into a negative pooled clinical matrix. The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration (tissue culture infective dose, $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ ) per sample that can be reproducibly distinguished from negative samples with $9 5 \%$ confidence or the lowest concentration at which 19 of 20 replicates were positive. Each strain was initially tested in a range finding study at 5 different concentrations in replicates of 20 per concentration of virus. Testing was performed with two lots of reagents across three testing days. The higher LoD observed per strain and per lot was selected for verification. Verification of the estimated LoD claim was performed on one reagent lot across a minimum of three testing days using 20 replicates per strain.

The LoD was determined empirically as the lowest concentration that had 19/20 or 20/20 positive results. The LoD point values for each strain tested are summarized in Table 8.

# Analytical Reactivity

The analytical reactivity of the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay was evaluated against multiple strains of influenza A H1N1 (seasonal pre-2009), influenza A H1N1 (pandemic 2009), influenza A H3N2 (seasonal), avian influenza A (H5N1, H5N2, H6N2, H7N2, H7N3, H2N2, H7N9, and H9N2), influenza B (representing strains from both Victoria and Yamagata lineages), and respiratory syncytial virus subgroups A and B (RSV A and RSV B) at levels near the analytical LoD. A total of 64 strains including 54 influenza viruses and 10 RSV strains were tested in this study with the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay. Three replicates were tested for each strain. Results are shown in Table 9.

Although this test has been shown to detect the novel avian influenza A (H7N9) cultured material, the performance characteristics of this device with clinical specimens that are positive for the novel avian influenza A (H7N9) virus have not been established. The Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay can distinguish between influenza A and B viruses, but it cannot differentiate influenza subtypes.

# f. Analytical Specificity:

The analytical specificity of the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay was evaluated by testing a panel of forty-four (44) microorganisms consisting of 16 viral, 26 bacterial, and 2 yeast strains representing common respiratory pathogens or those potentially encountered in the nasopharynx. One replicate each of three external controls (one positive control for Flu A/B, one positive control for RSV, and one negative control) was tested with the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay on each day of the study.

Bacterial stock cultures were prepared by suspending the bacterial growth from an agar plate in PBS buffer containing $1 5 \%$ glycerol. All bacterial strains were tested in triplicate at concentrations o $\mathrm { f } \geq \mathrm { i } 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ with the exception of one strain which was tested at $1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ (Chlamydia pneumoniae). Viral stock cultures were propagated using recommended tissue culture cell lines and hemagglutination assays were used to establish titers. All viral strains were tested in triplicate at concentrations of $\ge 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ . Three replicates of a no template control (background matrix diluted in background matrix) were also tested.

All the strains were diluted into a simulated background matrix. The simulated background matrix consisted of $2 . 5 \%$ (w/v) porcine mucin, $1 \% ( \mathrm { v / v } )$ human whole blood in $0 . 8 5 \%$ sodium chloride (NaCl) formulated in 1X PBS solution with $1 5 \%$ glycerol, which was then diluted in UTM to a final concentration of $1 6 . 7 \%$ . Negative specimens consisted of the diluted simulated background matrix only. Dilutions were prepared daily and kept on ice prior to testing.

Results are summarized in Table 10. The results demonstrate that the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay does not cross-react with any of the 44 common respiratory microorganisms tested in this study.

$^ { \mathrm { a } } 1$ out of the 3 original replicates tested as “Flu A Positive”. The Ct score associated with the false positive was 39.4; near the cut-off of 40.0 for a positive call. An additional 23 replicates were tested and all 23 were negative for all three analyte channels.

# g. Potentially Interfering Substances:

In a non-clinical study, potentially interfering substances that may be present in the nasopharynx were evaluated relative to the performance of the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay. Negative samples $( \mathtt { n } = 8 )$ ) were tested per each substance to determine the effect on the performance of the sample processing control (SPC). Positive samples $( \mathbf { n } = 8 )$ were tested per substance with six influenza (four influenza A and two influenza B) and four RSV (two RSV A and two RSV B) strains spiked at $2 \mathbf { x }$ the analytical LoD determined for each strain. All results were compared to positive and negative Universal Transport Medium (UTM) controls. The evaluated substances are listed in Table 11 with active ingredients and concentrations tested shown. There was no assay interference in the presence of the substances at the concentrations tested in this study. All positive and negative replicates were correctly identified using the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay.

FluMist vaccine samples were correctly reported as Flu A POSITIVE; FLU B POSITIVE; RSV NEGATIVE as expected. Samples containing FluMist may cause false positive results.

\*FluMist contains live, attenuated influenza strains comprised of influenza A H3N2, influenza A H1N1, and influenza B. FluMist tested positive for Flu A and Flu B and negative for RSV using the Xpert Flu A/B & RSV XC Assay as expected. The strains listed in Table 12 were not tested in the presence of FluMist. Negative samples were not tested in the presence of FluMist due to an inability to assess the effect of FluMist on the SPC controls as compared to a positive sample.

# Competitive interference

Competitive interference caused by clinically relevant co-infections of the targets in the Xpert Flu/RSV XC was evaluated by testing individual influenza and RSV

strains at LoD and spiking in different influenza or RSV strains at a higher concentration in a simulated background matrix. The concentration of each strain at LoD ranged from 0.57 TCID $5 0 / \mathrm { m L }$ to $2 . 0 \mathrm { T C I D } 5 0 / \mathrm { m L }$ and the concentration of the competitive strains ranged from $1 0 ^ { 3 } \mathrm { T C I D } 5 0 / \mathrm { m L }$ to $1 0 ^ { 4 } \mathrm { T C I D } 5 0 / \mathrm { m L }$ . Analytical competitive interference was assessed using one (1) seasonal Flu A H3 strain (H3/Victoria/361/2011), one (1) Flu B strain (Flu B/Mass/2/2012), one (1) RSV A strain (RSV-A/2/Australia/61), and one (1) RSV B strain (RSV-B/Wash/18537/62).

Replicates of 20 were tested for each target strain and each competitive strain combination. The normal binomial distribution with 20 replicate samples at LoD is between 17 and 20 positive results based on the binomial distribution with $\Nu { = } 2 0$ , $\mathrm { p } { = } . 9 5$ $( \mathrm { X } { \sim } \mathrm { B i n } ( 2 0 , 0 . 9 5 ) )$ . Therefore, sets of 20 with 16 or less positives would be rare and an indication of a competitive inhibitory effect due to high levels of a competing analyte. One replicate each of three external controls (one Flu A/B positive, one RSV positive and one negative) was tested with the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay on each day of this study.

Under the conditions of the study using the normal binomial distribution with 20 replicate samples at LoD of between 17 and 20 positive results, no competitive inhibitory effects were observed at the analytical LoD for each of the strains tested in the presence of another analyte. The results for each analyte at LoD in combination with another competitive analyte are shown in Tables 13 through 16. The average Ct values for each strain tested at LoD without a competitive analyte are taken from the Limit of Detection study.

f. Assay cut-off:

The Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay detects Flu A, Flu B, and RSV targets. For Flu A, Flu B and RSV, the valid cycle threshold $\mathrm { ( C t ) }$ range is 12.0 to 40.0. A Flu A 1, Flu A 2 cycle threshold (Ct) outside the maximum valid range is reported “Flu A NEGATIVE”. A Flu B cycle threshold (Ct) outside the maximum valid range is reported “Flu B NEGATIVE”. A RSV cycle threshold (Ct) outside the maximum valid range is reported “RSV NEGATIVE”. The Ct cutoffs are included as automatic calculations in the assay definition file (ADF) provided with the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

N/A

# b. Matrix comparison:

To demonstrate that the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay performs equivalently in either mid-turbinate (MT) swab clinical matrix or simulated matrix, an equivalency study was performed. The MT swab specimens were collected from healthy individuals and pooled to obtain a “clinical background matrix” for the equivalency study. The simulated background matrix consisted of $2 . 5 \%$ (w/v) porcine mucin, $1 \%$ (v/v) human whole blood in $0 . 8 5 \%$ sodium chloride (NaCl) formulated in 1X PBS solution with $1 5 \%$ glycerol, which was then diluted in Copan UTM to a final concentration of $1 6 . 7 \%$ . This simulated background matrix represents both swab specimens and nasal aspirate/wash (NA/W) specimens. Both matrices were

confirmed to be negative with the Xpert Flu/RSV XC. Assay before being used to prepare positive samples.

Sensitivity (positive agreement) for all strains in both MT swab clinical matrix and simulated matrix was $100 \%$ (Lower $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I } = 9 4 . 5 \% )$ using the Fisher Exact Method (all 65 positive samples for each strain in MT swab clinical matrix and simulated matrix background were correctly reported positive for all strains).

# c. Fresh versus frozen equivalency

Fresh and frozen specimen equivalency in the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay was evaluated by testing individual influenza and RSV strains at three different concentrations representing low positives (2x LoD), moderate positives (5x LoD), and high positives (10x LoD) in simulated background matrix. Negative samples consisted of simulated background matrix only. Fresh and frozen specimen equivalency was determined using one seasonal Flu A H3N2 strain (A/Victoria/361/2011), one Flu B strain B/Wisconsin/01/11), one RSV A strain (RSV A/Long/MD/56), and one RSV B strain (RSV B/9320/MA/77). Replicates of 20 were tested for each specimen type and concentration. All positive and negative specimens were tested fresh, after one freeze-thaw cycle, and after two freeze-thaw cycles. There was no statistically significant effect in the performance of the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay between fresh virus dilutions and two sequential freeze thaw cycles for positive and negative samples. All positive and negative replicates were correctly identified using the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay.

# 3. Clinical studies:

# a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity

A total of 1275 subject specimens were collected in the clinical study. Of the 1275 eligible specimens, 1254 were included in the study (16 specimens were delayed for shipment for reference testing, 3 specimens leaked during transit or were mislabeled, 1 specimen was not tested on the subject device within 24

hours, and one specimen was unresolved on the comparator assay). There were 18 indeterminate results on first attempt. One of the indeterminate results was not retested according to protocol. Of the remaining 17 indeterminate results, 14 yielded valid results upon repeat testing resulting in 1250 results (657 NA/W and $5 9 3 \mathrm { N P }$ swab specimens) included in the final dataset used for the analyses. Three results were invalid and therefore not included in the final results. Of the 1250 specimens included in the data analyses, 637 were collected from female subjects and 613 from male subjects. Collection and testing was performed at 6 geographically diverse locations representing intended use sites.

Age distribution of the patients from whom the specimens were obtained was as follows: 332 $( 2 6 . 6 \% )$ of the specimens 5 years or younger; 258 $( 2 0 . 6 \% )$ from ages 6 to 21; 413 $( 3 3 . 0 \% )$ from ages 22 to 59; 235 $( 1 8 . 8 \% )$ from ages 60 or older; and 12 $( 1 . 0 \% )$ were from patients of unknown age.

The study included prospectively collected NP swab or NA/W specimens from subjects with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. Inclusion criteria required leftover specimens with volumes $\geq 2 \mathrm { m L }$ in order to allow for sufficient aliquots for testing $\mathrm { 0 . 6 { m L } }$ to $0 . 8 \mathrm { m L }$ for Xpert Flu/RSV XC testing, $1 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ for reference method testing, and $0 . 2 \mathrm { m L }$ available for sequencing in the event of a discrepancy). Due to the low prevalence of some influenza strains during the study season, the study population was supplemented with frozen specimens. Frozen specimens consisted of archived positive specimens originally collected for standard of care influenza testing between November 28, 2012 and May 3, 2014. A fresh vs. frozen equivalency study was performed prior to including the frozen specimens in the clinical study. Only those samples meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included. Specimens were tested on the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay and an FDA-cleared molecular assay as the comparator method.

Specimens were tested with the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay within 24 hours of collection (fresh) or 24 hours of thawing (frozen). Discordant results between the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay and the FDA-cleared molecular comparator assay were further analyzed by bi-directional sequencing using primers different from those used in the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay.

A total of 657 NA/W specimens were tested for influenza A, influenza B and RSV by the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay and the comparator assay. Of the 657 NA/W specimens, 581 were fresh, prospectively collected and 76 were frozen, archived specimens.

When testing fresh, prospectively collected NA/W specimens, the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay demonstrated a PPA and NPA for detection of influenza A of $100 \%$ and $100 \%$ , respectively, relative to the comparator assay. The Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay PPA and NPA for influenza B were $9 9 . 2 \%$ and $100 \%$ , respectively. The Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay PPA and NPA for RSV were $9 8 . 5 \%$ and $9 9 . 6 \%$ , respectively.

When testing frozen, archived NA/W specimens, the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay demonstrated a PPA and NPA for detection of influenza A of $9 7 . 1 \%$ and $100 \%$ , respectively, relative to the comparator assay. The Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay PPA and NPA for influenza B were $100 \%$ and $100 \%$ , respectively. The Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay PPA and NPA for RSV were $8 4 . 6 \%$ and $100 \%$ , respectively.

# 4. Clinical cut-off:

The assay cut-off was determined by analysis of pre-clinical data derived from a beta study using the comparator assay. The valid minimum cycle threshold setting for Flu A 1, Flu A 2, Flu B, and RSV was set at $1 2 \mathrm { C t }$ (Cycle threshold) because a Ct cannot be calculated before the end of the minimum background subtraction range, which is 10 cycles. The earliest Flu A 1, Flu A 2, Flu B, and RSV Ct reported in true influenza A positive, influenza B positive, and RSV positive results during pre-clinical testing was greater than $1 2 \mathrm { C t }$ . Pre-clinical testing of Flu A Ct in NP and NA/W specimens indicated a Mean Ct of 23.55 with a standard deviation of $4 . 9 8 \ : \mathrm { C t }$ . Testing of Flu B NA/W specimens indicated a Mean Ct of 24.52 with a standard deviation of $4 . 2 0 \mathrm { C t } .$ . Testing of RSV NP and NA/W specimens indicated a mean Ct of 24.24 with a standard deviation of $4 . 6 0 \mathrm { C t }$ . The valid maximum cycle threshold setting for Flu A 1, Flu A 2, Flu B, and RSV was set at 40.0 to account for true positives with low viral concentrations.

# 5. Expected values/Reference range:

The Xpert Flu/RSV XC clinical study included a total of 771 prospectively collected fresh specimens and 479 prospectively collected frozen specimens. The number and percentage of cases positive for one or more of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV, as determined by the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay are shown by age category and specimen type (NA/W or NP swab specimen) in Tables 20 and 21:
