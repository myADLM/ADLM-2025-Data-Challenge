# B. Purpose for Submission:

The Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct, originally cleared under k120413, was modified to improve detection of newer circulating influenza strains while maintaining sensitivity for detection of previous influenza strains. The labeling was updated to include analytical reactivity data for the following additional six (6) strains of influenza A and two (2) strains of influenza B: influenza A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N7) , influenza A/California/12/2012 (H1N1) pdm09, influenza A/Indiana/08/2011 (H3N2)v, influenza A/Minnesota/11/2010 (H3N2)v, influenza A/Ohio/02/2012 (H3N2), influenza A/Texas/50/2012(H3N2), influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008, and influenza B/Wisconsin/01/2010.

# C. Measurand:

The Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct detects target RNA sequences for the highly conserved regions of the matrix protein genes of influenza A and influenza B viruses, and the M gene of RSV.

# D. Type of Test:

This is a qualitative Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay used with the 3M Integrated Cycler instrument for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A virus, influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) from symptomatic patients. The assay measures viral RNA directly from un-extracted nasopharyngeal swab specimens. An on-board pre-heating step opens the viral coat releasing the viral RNA. A bi-functional fluorescent probe-primer is used together with a reverse primer to amplify a specific target for each analyte and the RNA internal control. Amplification and detection is performed on the 3M Integrated Cycler with Integrated Cycler Studio Software version 4.2 or higher.

The Focus Diagnostics SimplexaTM Flu A/B & RSV Direct assay is intended for use on the 3M Integrated Cycler instrument for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. This test is intended for use as an aid in the differential diagnosis of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV viral infections in humans and is not intended to detect influenza C.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus or RSV infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.

Performance characteristics for influenza A were established with clinical specimens collected during the 2010/2011 influenza season when 2009 H1N1 influenza and H3N2 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to the state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $3 +$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

# I. Device Description:

See k120413 for full description of the device.

The Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct (K120413) was modified to improve the detection of newer, evolving strains of influenza viruses. The changes were made in two phases. The first phase of the modifications (Gen 2.0) included changes to the reaction mix formulation and cycling conditions: (a) change in the annealing temperature (decreased), (b) change in the run time (increased), (c) change in the enzyme used, and (d) change to the RSV cut-off Ct (decreased). Limited changes (Gen. 2.1) were also made to the manufacturing process and materials to increase the stability of the reaction mix and to minimize non-specific products.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

# L. Test Principle:

The Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV is a real-time RT-PCR amplification and detection system that utilizes a bi-functional fluorescent probe-primer for the detection and differentiation of human influenza A virus RNA, human influenza B virus RNA and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RNA directly from unextracted nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens. An on-board pre-heating step opens the viral coat releasing the viral RNA. A bi-functional fluorescent probe-primer is used together with a reverse primer to amplify a specific target (for each analyte and the RNA internal control). A fluorescent signal is generated as a result of the binding of a probe element to the extended DNA fragment synthesized during the amplification. The 3M Integrated Cycler is a thermocycler capable of heating, cooling, mixing of sample and reagents, amplification, and real-time detection of fluorescence. There are four optical channels allowing for detection of up to four targets simultaneously. The table below shows the excitation and emission wavelengths for each of the standard channels provided as part of the Integrated Cycler instrument.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance:

See k120413

The Simplexa Flu A/B and RSV Direct assay was modified in two phases (Gen. 2.0 and Gen 2.1). The performance of the device was evaluated in analytical studies after each modification. The data shown below were generated using the final version of the device, Gen.2.1.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reaction mix inter-lot reproducibility was evaluated for Simplexa™ Flu A/B and RSV

Direct Gen 2.1 using three reaction mix lots. The sample panel used for testing consisted of one low positive each for influenza A, influenza B, and RSV, one medium positive each for influenza A, influenza B, and RSV, one negative and one positive control for a total of 8 samples in the panel. Low positive samples were created by spiking influenza A, influenza B, or RSV organisms into negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix at 1.5 times LoD. Medium positive samples were created by spiking influenza A, influenza B, or RSV organisms into negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix at 4 times LoD. Pooled negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix was used as the negative samples. Each sample panel member was tested in duplicate per reaction mix lot in each run, two runs per day for total of three days. The study was performed using a total of four Integrated Cyclers, each operated by a different operator. One lot of Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct Positive Control Pack was used throughout testing. The Negative Template Control (NTC) and Positive Control were tested on each instrument once each day as a control set. The table below shows the strains and the concentrations of the sample panel.

\*The flu B moderate positive sample was tested in 41 replicates due to inadvertently testing flu B moderate positive instead of flu B low positive.

All samples generated expected results $100 \%$ of the time. The modified device demonstrated acceptable reproducibility with the total $\% C V$ values ranging from $1 \%$ to $2 . 3 \%$ .

See k120413 for additional information and for site-to-site reproducibility.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

See k120413.

# d. Detection limit:

Three strains of influenza A, two strains of influenza B and two strains of RSV were tested to determine the limit of detection (LoD) for the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen 2.1 assay kit. Serial dilutions of quantified virus stocks spiked into negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix were prepared. Four concentrations per virus were tested in triplicate during the screening phase to determine the tentative LoD for each target virus. The lowest concentration with all three replicates of the target virus detected during the screening phase was tested in thirty two (32) replicates to confirm the reliable detection at that concentration. The LoD is determined to be the concentration at which at least 31/32 $( \geq 9 5 . 0 \% )$ replicates are detected. The comparison of the limit of detection of the Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV between the original device (Gen 1.0) and the modified device (Gen 2.1) is shown below.

# Cross-reactivity

Thirty two (32) organisms were tested at clinically relevant concentrations to evaluate cross-reactivity of the Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen 2.1 Kit. Three instruments were used to perform 15 experimental runs across two days by a single operator. One lot of reaction mix and one lot of positive control were used to conduct the study. Each organism was spiked into negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix and tested in triplicate. A total of five replicates of baseline negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix were tested. One set of controls, a Negative Template Control (NTC) and a Positive Control, was tested on each instrument on each day of testing. No cross-reactivity was observed with the organisms tested, as shown below.

# $f .$ Analytical reactivity

A total of 34 viruses (19 strains of influenza A (including H1, H3 and H5 subtypes), 11 strains of influenza B and 4 strains of RSV) were tested to evaluate analytical reactivity of the modified (Gen. 2.1) Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct assay. The most recent strains and geographically diverse strains were chosen. A total of three 3M Integrated Cyclers were used to perform 19 experimental runs over four days by a single operator. One lot of reaction mix and one lot of Positive Control were used to conduct the study. Each organism was spiked into negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix and tested at least in triplicate. Total of five replicates of the baseline negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix were tested. One set of controls (NTC and Positive Control) was tested on each instrument on each day of testing. With the exception of the influenza A/Ohio/02/2012 (H3N2), all of the analytical reactivity panel viruses were detected with the modified device at the same concentrations as they were with the original device. The influenza A/Ohio/02/2012 (H3N2) was detected at $2 0 0 \mathrm { C E I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ by the modified device while the original device (Gen 1.0) detected the same strain at $1 0 0 \mathrm { C E I D } _ { 5 0 }$ . The newly tested influenza A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus was detected at $2 5 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { E I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ .

# 2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The modified device was validated with clinical samples in each of the two phases of the changes, Gen 2.0 and Gen 2.1.

1. Comparison between Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen 1.0 and Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen 2.0

The changes implemented for Gen 2.0 were evaluated with archived clinical samples. Based on historical data, 265 samples in Universal Transport Medium (UTM) or Viral Transport Medium (VTM) were assembled with 55 samples positive for influenza A, 55 samples positive for influenza B, 55 samples positive for RSV and 100 samples negative for all of the viruses tested. The 265 samples tested included 131 archived clinical samples originally tested in the clinical study conducted in support of the 510(k) submission (K120413). The other 134 samples included 33 archived samples from the 2010-2011 flu season and 101 samples from the 2013- 2014 flu season. The samples were tested in parallel using the Simplexa™ Flu A/B&RSV Gen 1.0 kit and the Simplexa™ Flu A/B&RSV Gen 2.0 kit. The positive percent agreement (PPA) and the negative percent agreement (NPA) between the results obtained with the Simplexa™ Gen 1.0 and the Simplexa™ Gen 2.0, for each virus, are shown below:
