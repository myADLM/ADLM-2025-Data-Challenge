# I. Device Description:

The Xpert Norovirus Assay is a, automated in vitro diagnostic test for detection and differentiation of nucleic acid sequences for norovirus genogroup I and genogroup II from human stool specimens collected from individuals with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis. The test utilizes automated, multiplex real-time, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect specific viral gene sequences associated with norovirus genogroup I and genogroup II.

The Xpert Norovirus Assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert Instrument Systems (GeneXpert Dx, GeneXpert Infinity-48, GeneXpert Infinity-48s, and GeneXpert Infinity80 systems). The GeneXpert Instrument System platform automates sample preparation, amplification and real-time detection. The GeneXpert Instrument Systems require the use of single-use, disposable cartridges (the Xpert Norovirus Cartridges) that hold the PCR reagents and host the PCR process.

The Xpert Norovirus Assay includes reagents for the detection and differentiation of nucleic acid sequences for norovirus genogroup I and genogroup II human stool specimens collected from patients with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis. All reagents except the Sample Reagent are contained pre-loaded in the cartridge. A Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) are also included in the cartridge. The SPC is present to control for adequate processing of the target viruses and to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the PCR reaction. The Probe Check Control (PCC) verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity and dye stability.

The single-use, multi-chambered fluidic cartridges are designed to complete sample preparation and real-time RT-PCR for detection and differentiation of norovirus genogroup I and genogroup II viral RNA in 90 minutes or less. The GeneXpert Instrument Systems, comprised of the GeneXpert Dx Systems and the GeneXpert Infinity Systems, have 1 to 80 randomly accessible modules, depending upon the instrument, that are each capable of performing separate sample preparation and realtime PCR and RT- PCR tests. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids (i.e., the syringe drive activates the plunger that works in concert with the rotary valve in the cartridge to move fluids between chambers), an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or spores, and a proprietary I-CORE® thermocycler for performing realtime PCR and RT-PCR and detection.

Specimens are collected following the user’s institution standard procedures for collecting stool specimens for norovirus testing and sent to the GeneXpert® testing area for processing. The specimen may be stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to two days prior to processing. When ready to process the specimen, a single-use disposable dry swab is used for transfer of the stool specimen to the Sample Reagent bottle that is provided with the Xpert Norovirus Assay kit. The user vortexes the capped Sample Reagent bottle for 10 seconds and transfers the entire contents to the sample chamber in the top of the disposable fluidic cartridge with a transfer pipette. The user initiates a test from the system user interface and places the cartridge into the GeneXpert instrument platform, which performs hands-off real-time, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of RNA. The results are automatically generated at the end of the process in a report that can be viewed and printed.

The Xpert Norovirus Assay kit contains sufficient reagents to process 10 specimens or quality control samples.

Not Applicable

# L. Test Principle:

The Xpert Norovirus Assay is automated and utilizes reverse real-time RT-PCR to detect specific viral gene sequences associated with norovirus genogroup I and genogroup II. The primers and probes in the Xpert Norovirus Assay are designed to amplify and detect unique gene sequences within the conserved region of the Norovirus genome. The stool specimens are collected from individuals with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis and transported to the laboratory in a clean container. A swab is inserted into the stool specimen and then placed in a tube containing sample reagent. Following a brief vortexing, the eluted sample is transferred into the sample chamber of the disposable fluidic cartridge (the GeneXpert cartridge). The GeneXpert cartridge is loaded onto the GeneXpert® Instrument System platform, which performs hands-off automated sample processing and real-time RT-PCR for identification and differentiation of norovirus genogroup I and genogroup II. Test results are obtained in 90 minutes.

b. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The Xpert Norovirus Assay includes a Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC). The success rate was $59 5 \%$ on the first attempt and was acceptable.

Recommended external quality control organisms were also tested at the sites. External controls should be used in accordance with accrediting institutions and government regulations. External controls are commercially available and not provided in the test kit; however, the catalog numbers for a source of external controls are provided in the “Materials Available but Not Provided” section of the Xpert Norovirus Assay Package Insert.

# c. Detection limit:

The limit of detection (LoD) study was performed to evaluate the analytical sensitivity of the Xpert Norovirus Assay using norovirus GI.3 and norovirus GII.4 diluted into a negative stool matrix. The LoD of the Xpert Norovirus Assay is defined as the lowest concentration (copies/mL) per sample that can be reproducibly distinguished from negative samples with $9 5 \%$ confidence. The LoD was determined using seven (7) dilutions per norovirus genotype with a minimum of 23 replicates per dilution using two reagent lots across 3 testing days. Dilutions were prepared with a pooled negative clinical stool matrix to achieve final concentrations ranging from $3 . 3 \dot { 2 } \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 4 }$

copies/mL to $3 . 9 8 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { c o p i e s / m L }$ for the norovirus GI.3 genotype and concentrations ranging from $1 . 0 3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ copies/mL to $4 . 9 7 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ copies/mL for the norovirus GII.4 genotype.

The LoD was estimated for each reagent lot using probit regression and the highest LoD observed per genotype from both lots was further verified by testing 20 replicates (verification of LoD).

The LoDs of the Xpert Norovirus Assay for the two genotypes are presented in the table below.

# d. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)

The analytical reactivity of the Xpert Norovirus Assay was evaluated against thirtyone genotypes representing norovirus genogroups GI and GII. The studies were carried out with positive clinical stool specimens or RNA transcripts (when clinical specimens were not readily available) representing multiple GI and GII genotypes at levels near the LoD. Positive clinical stool specimens were tested for six (6) GI genotypes and fourteen (14) GII genotypes including the recently circulating Norovirus GII.4 Sydney strain and the previously dominant Norovirus GII.4 New Orleans strain with the Xpert Norovirus Assay. Eleven (11) RNA transcripts were tested for three (3) GI genotypes and eight (8) GII genotypes with the Xpert Norovirus Assay. The results of the analytical reactivity (inclusivity) study demonstrated that the Xpert Norovirus Assay appropriately identified all the temporally and geographically diverse samples selected to represent the range of norovirus genotypes. The table below shows the data for the analytical studies.

a An estimated concentration or titer was provided based on a Ct value; because of the difficulty in culturing norovirus particles, an exact concentration cannot be provided. The Ct value for each clinical specimen in the inclusivity study was extrapolated to the titer obtained from the LoD study for well-characterized GI and GII samples using a standard curve at CDC b Naked RNA transcripts were used for these strains because clinical samples were not available at the time of testing.

# e. Analytical specificity (Cross Reactivity):

The analytical specificity of the Xpert Norovirus Assay was evaluated by testing a panel of 68 organisms, consisting of 54 bacteria, 1 fungus, 9 viruses, and 4 parasites, representing common gastroenteritis pathogens or those potentially encountered in stool. All organisms were tested with a minimum of three replicates. The bacteria and fungus were tested at concentrations $\geq 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ . The viruses were tested at concentrations $\geq 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ , with the exception of two viruses obtained from clinical samples with unknown concentrations. The parasites were tested at concentrations $\geq 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ copies/mL. All organisms tested were correctly reported as Norovirus GI not DETECTED; Noro GII not DETECTED by the Xpert Norovirus Assay. Results are shown in the table below.

# f. Interference

Potentially interfering substances that may be present in stool were tested for effects on the performance of the Xpert Norovirus Assay. Potentially interfering substances included hemoglobin, mucin, cholesterol, triglycerides and whole blood, plus additional endogenous and exogenous substances listed in the following table.

Negative samples were tested in replicates of eight with each substance in a negative stool matrix to determine the effect on the performance of the sample processing control (SPC). Positive samples were tested in replicates of eight per substance with one Norovirus GI and one Norovirus GII clinical isolate near the LoD of the Xpert Norovirus Assay.

All results were compared to positive and negative controls prepared in negative stool matrix. All valid positive and negative control samples were correctly reported using the Xpert Norovirus Assay.

Inhibition of the Xpert Norovirus Assay was observed in the presence of benzalkonium chloride $( 1 \% \mathrm { ( w / v ) }$ , $0 . 2 \%$ (w/v), and $0 . 0 4 \%$ (w/v)). False negative test results were reported for the Norovirus GII target at $1 \% \mathrm { ( w / v ) }$ benzalkonium chloride. In the presence of $5 \%$ (w/w) barium sulfate, a statistically significant inhibitory effect was observed on the Norovirus GII $\mathrm { C t }$ in positive samples relative to the control sample (p-value $< 0 . 0 5$ ). No statistically significant effect was observed on the Norovirus GII Ct relative to the control sample in the presence of $1 \%$ (w/w) barium sulfate.

No other potentially interfering substances were found to be inhibitory and no false-negatives were reported for these substances.

# g. Carry-over Contamination Study

A study was conducted to demonstrate that the single-use, self-contained GeneXpert cartridges prevent carry-over contamination in negative samples that are run immediately after very high positive samples have been run in the same GeneXpert module. The study consisted of a negative sample processed in a GeneXpert module immediately followed by a highly positive Norovirus GII sample processed in the same GeneXpert module. This testing scheme was repeated 21 times in two GeneXpert modules for a total of 42 runs for 20 positive and 22 negative specimens. All 19 positive samples were correctly reported as “Norovirus GI not Detected; Norovirus GII Detected” and one positive sample was reported as an Error. All 22 negative samples were correctly reported as “Norovirus GI not Detected; Norovirus GII not Detected.”

Clinical Performance

Performance characteristics of the Xpert Norovirus Assay were evaluated at seven institutions in the U.S. and Europe. The study specimens consisted of raw or unpreserved unformed stool specimens from subjects with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis. The Xpert Norovirus Assay performance was compared to a composite reference test method performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A total of 1403 specimens were tested for norovirus GI by the Xpert Norovirus Assay and the composite reference test. Of the 1403 specimens, 914 were fresh, prospectively collected and 489 were frozen, archived specimens. A total of 1401 specimens were tested for norovirus GII by the Xpert Norovirus Assay and the composite reference test. Of the 1401 specimens, 914 were fresh, prospectively collected and 487 were frozen, archived specimens.

With fresh, prospectively collected specimens, the Xpert Norovirus Assay demonstrated a Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) of $100 \%$ and a Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) of $9 9 . 6 \%$ for detection of Norovirus GI, relative to the composite reference test. The Xpert Norovirus Assay demonstrated $9 8 . 5 \%$ PPA and $9 8 . 8 \%$ NPA for detection of Norovirus GII in fresh, prospectively collected specimens.

With frozen, archived specimens, the Xpert Norovirus Assay demonstrated $9 8 . 1 \%$ PPA and $9 4 . 6 \%$ NPA for detection of Norovirus GI, relative to the composite reference test. The Xpert Norovirus Assay demonstrated $100 \%$ PPA and $9 6 . 8 \%$ NPA for detection of Norovirus GII with frozen, archived specimens.
