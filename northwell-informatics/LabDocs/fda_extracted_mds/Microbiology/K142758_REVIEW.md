# L. Test Principle:

The ADVIA Centaur HAV Total assay is a fully automated, competitive immunoassay using direct, chemiluminescent technology. The assay consists of three reagent addition and incubation steps. First, the sample is pretreated with Ancillary Reagent containing cysteine. Next, HAV antigen is added from the ancillary well (Antigen Reagent). Lite Reagent and Solid Phase are then added. The Lite Reagent contains monoclonal mouse antibody to HAV antigen labeled with acridinium ester and biotinylated Fab fragment of a monoclonal mouse antibody to HAV antigen. The Solid Phase contains streptavidin covalently coupled to paramagnetic particles. After the final incubation, the immuno-complex formed is washed with Wash 1 prior to initiation of the chemiluminescent reaction. The relative light units (RLUs) detected by the ADVIA Centaur System are used to calculate the Index Value from the Master Curve.

Interpretation of results

Samples with a calculated value of less than 1.00 Index Value are considered nonreactive for antibodies to hepatitis A virus. C Samples with a calculated value greater than or equal to 1.00 Index Value are considered reactive for antibodies to hepatitis A virus.

Assay results above the cutoff of the assay are not indicative of antibody level.

# Pediatric testing (Clinical)

Fifty-five (55) pediatric serum samples (male and female, age range from 2 to 21 years), including samples from a high risk population, were evaluated with the ADVIA Centaur HAVT assay and another commercially available assay.

The percent agreement (including $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals) of results for reactive and nonreactive samples between the ADVIA Centaur HAVT and the comparative assay for the pediatric population is shown in the following table:

# Neonate vs Adult Comparison

A study was conducted to evaluate the results observed when neonatal samples are tested with the ADVIA Centaur HAVT assay. Cord blood serum was used as a surrogate for neonatal serum. A total of thirty (30) cord blood and 30 adult serum samples were spiked with anti-HAV positive stock to yield samples at different analyte levels. The distribution of percent bias between the index values of the cord blood serum samples and the mean observed index values of the adult serum samples are summarized in the following table:
