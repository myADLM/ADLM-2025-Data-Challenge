4. Panel: Microbiology (83)

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay, performed on the GeneXpert® Instrument Systems, is a qualitative, nested real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in vitro diagnostic test for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA in raw sputum or concentrated sputum sediment prepared from induced or expectorated sputum. In specimens where Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB-complex) is detected, the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay also detects the rifampin-resistance associated mutations of the rpoB gene.

The Xpert MTB/RIF Assay is intended for use with specimens from patients for whom there is clinical suspicion of tuberculosis (TB) and who have received no antituberculosis therapy, or less than three days of therapy. This test is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis when used in conjunction with clinical and other laboratory findings.

An Xpert MTB/RIF Assay result of “MTB NOT DETECTED” from either one or two sputum specimens is highly predictive of the absence of M. tuberculosis complex bacilli on serial fluorescent acid-fast sputum smears from patients with suspected active pulmonary tuberculosis and can be used as an aid in the decision of whether continued airborne infection isolation (AII) is warranted in patients with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis. The determination of whether testing of either one or two sputum specimens is appropriate for decisions regarding removal from AII should be based on specific clinical circumstances and institutional guidelines. Clinical decisions regarding the need for continued AII should always occur in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory evaluations and Xpert MTB/RIF Assay results should not be the sole basis for infection control practices.

The Xpert MTB/RIF Assay must always be used in conjunction with mycobacterial culture to address the risk of false negative results and to recover organisms when MTBcomplex is present for further characterization and drug susceptibility testing. However, decisions regarding the removal of patients from AII need not wait for culture results. Sputum specimens for TB culture, AFB smear microscopy, and Xpert MTB/RIF Assay testing should follow CDC recommendations with regard to collection methods and time frame between specimen collection.

The Xpert MTB/RIF Assay does not provide confirmation of rifampin susceptibility since mechanisms of rifampin resistance other than those detected by this device may exist that may be associated with a lack of clinical response to treatment.

Specimens that have both MTB-complex DNA and rifampin-resistance associated mutations of the rpoB gene detected by the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay must have results confirmed by a reference laboratory. If the presence of rifampin-resistance associated mutations of the rpoB gene is confirmed, specimens should also be tested for the

presence of genetic mutations associated with resistance to other drugs.

The Xpert MTB/RIF Assay should only be performed in laboratories that follow safety practices in accordance with the CDC/NIH Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories publication and applicable state or local regulations.

2. Indication(s) for use: Same as Intended Use

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): The Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay is for prescription use only in accordance with 21 CFR 801.09.

4. Special instrument requirements:

The Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay is for use with the GeneXpert® Instrument Systems, including the GeneXpert® Diagnostic (Dx) Systems and GeneXpert® Infinity Systems.

# I. Device Description:

The Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay is an automated in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of MTB-complex DNA and the genetic mutations associated with rifampin (Rif) resistance in raw sputum samples or concentrated sputum sediments from patients for whom there is clinical suspicion of TB and who have received no antituberculosis therapy, or less than 3 days of therapy. The primers in this test amplify a portion of the rpoB gene containing the 81 base pair core region. The probes are designed to differentiate between the conserved wild-type sequence and mutations in the core region that are associated with Rifampin (Rif) resistance. The assay is performed on Cepheid GeneXpert® Instrument Systems.

The Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay includes single-use disposable cartridges and sample reagent for sample preparation. The Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay cartridges contain reagents for the detection of MTB-complex DNA and Rif resistance associated mutations. A Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) are also included in the cartridge. The SPC is present to control for adequate processing of the target microorganism and to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the PCR reaction. The Probe Check Control (PCC) verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity and dye stability.

Sputum specimens are collected according to the institution’s standard procedures and transported to the GeneXpert® Instrument System area. For raw sputum, Sample Reagent is added to the sample (2:1, v:v). Sample Reagent is added to the resuspended sputum sediment ( $1 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ Sample Reagent to $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ suspension or 3:1, v:v, for larger volumes of sediment suspension). For both specimen types, the solution is shaken vigorously to

mix, and then incubated at $2 0 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 15 minutes. Using the transfer pipette provided, the specimen is transferred to the open port of the Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay cartridge.

The user initiates a test from the system user interface, the Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay cartridge is loaded onto the GeneXpert® Instrument System platform, which performs hands-off, automated sample processing, and real-time PCR for detection of DNA. Summary and detailed test results are obtained in approximately 2 hours and are displayed in tabular and graphic formats.

The Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay simultaneously detects MTB-complex and the genetic mutations associated with rifampin resistance by amplifying a MTB-complex specific sequence of the rpoB gene, which is probed with five molecular beacons (Probes A – E) for mutations within the rifampin-resistance determining region (RRDR). Each molecular beacon is labeled with a different fluorophore.

The valid maximum cycle threshold $\mathrm { ( C t ) }$ of 39.0 for Probes A, B and C and 36.0 for Probes D and E are set for data analysis.

“MTB DETECTED”, is reported when at least two probes result in Ct values within the valid range and a delta Ct min (the smallest Ct difference between any pair of probes) of less than 2.0. “Rif Resistance NOT DETECTED” is reported if the delta Ct max (the Ct difference between the earliest and latest probe) is ${ \le } 4 . 0$ . · “Rif Resistance DETECTED” is reported if the delta Ct max is ${ > } 4 . 0$ . “Rif Resistance INDETERMINATE” is reported when the following two conditions are met: 1. the Ct value of any probe exceeds the valid maximum Ct (or is zero, i.e. no threshold crossing); and 2. the earliest rpoB Ct value is greater than [(Valid maximum Ct of probe in condition1) - (delta Ct max cut-off of 4.0)]

· “MTB NOT DETECTED” is reported when there is only one or no positive probe.

All assay settings are included as automatic calculations in the Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay protocol and cannot be modified by the user.

# L. Test Principle:

The primers and probes in the Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay detect the presence of a unique gene sequence in MTB-complex DNA by using fluorogenic target-specific hybridization for detection of the amplified DNA. Sputum specimens are collected from patients with clinical suspicion of tuberculosis. The specimen is mixed with Sample Reagent, shaken 10 to 20 times or vortexed for at least 10 seconds, and incubated for 15 minutes at $2 0 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . At 5 to 10 minutes into the incubation period, the specimen is shaken or vortexed again, and incubated for the remainder of the 15 minute incubation period prior to transferring it to the assay cartridge for testing. The GeneXpert® performs sample preparation by mixing the prepared sample with the lyophilized Sample Processing Control. The cells are filtered and washed with buffer to remove inhibitors and contaminants, and lysed using glass beads and an ultrasonic horn, eluting the released DNA. The DNA is mixed with dry real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reagents and transferred into the integrated PCR tube for real-time PCR amplification and detection of chromosomal DNA gene sequences for MTBcomplex.

3. Clinical studies:

A prospective multi-center study (Study 2) was conducted at multiple sites in the United States, as well as South Africa and Brazil. Performance of the MTB/RIF Assay was assessed as an alternative to fluorescent stained AFB-smear microscopy as an aid in determining the need for continued airborne infection isolation in patients with suspected active pulmonary tuberculosis. Results from Xpert MTB/RIF Assay testing of two serial sputum specimens in study subjects with suspected active pulmonary tuberculosis were compared to results of fluorescent stained AFB smears of the same specimens; a subset of subjects had a third sputum specimen tested by AFB-smear but not by the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay. Each specimen was cultured for MTB-complex using liquid and solid culture media, with mycobacterial growth confirmed for MTB-complex and rifampin drug susceptibility testing performed via the Middlebrook agar proportion method. Study 2 was also designed to evaluate the clinical performance of the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay using prospectively collected sputum specimens in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected populations

Study subjects 18 years or older were eligible for enrollment if they were suspected of pulmonary tuberculosis, on no treatment or had fewer than 48 hours of TB treatment within 180 days prior to collection of the first sputum specimen, and had determination/documentation of HIV status. Subjects were included in the analysis if they produced at least two sputum specimens collected in sufficient volume for testing by Xpert MTB/RIF Assay, AFB smear, and MTB culture, and interpretable results were available for all three methods. A third specimen for analysis was collected at some sites based on standard of care protocols. Of 992 eligible and tested subjects, thirty-two subjects $( 3 . 2 \% )$ were excluded from the analysis: 7 due to absence of culture results and 3 due to MTB culture contamination. Twenty-two subjects $( 2 . 2 \% )$ were excluded due to Xpert MTB/RIF Assay non-determinate results (i.e., INVALID, ERROR, or NO RESULT). Therefore, 960 subjects were used in the analysis based on the first Xpert MTB/RIF Assay result. Twenty of the 22 subjects excluded from analysis based on the first Xpert MTB/RIF Assay result gave valid results for the second Xpert MTB/RIF Assay test specimen, therefore, analysis based on two Xpert MTB/RIF Assay test specimens included a total of 980 subjects.

Study subjects were $62 \%$ male, $3 8 \%$ female. Sixty-five $( 6 5 \% )$ percent of subjects were from the U.S., and $3 5 \%$ were from non-U.S. sites. Forty-five $( 4 5 \% )$ percent of study subjects were HIV-infected and $5 5 \%$ were HIV-uninfected subjects. Expectorated and induced sputa represented $5 9 . 6 \%$ and $3 3 . 6 \%$ of specimens respectively; $7 \%$ of sputum specimens were unspecified. Twenty-eight percent of specimens were raw sputa and $72 \%$ were concentrated sputum sediments.

Of 215 study subjects with culture confirmed MTB-complex $1 4 . 2 \%$ [88/618] of U.S. subjects and $3 7 . 1 \%$ [127/342] of non-U.S. subjects), $9 9 \%$ of subjects $9 7 \%$ of U.S. subjects and $100 \%$ of non-U.S. subjects) with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis where MTB-complex was detected by acid-fast microscopy of two or three serial sputum specimens also had MTB-complex detected by testing of a single sputum by the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay. Results from testing of two serial sputum specimens by the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay detected MTB-complex in all AFB-smear-positive subjects ( $100 \%$ in the U.S. subjects and $100 \%$ in non-U.S. subjects).

A single negative Xpert MTB/RIF Assay result predicted the absence of AFB smearpositive pulmonary tuberculosis with an overall negative predictive value (NPV) of $9 9 . 7 \%$ $( 9 9 . 6 \%$ in the U.S. and $100 \%$ in non-U.S.). Two serial negative Xpert MTB/RIF Assay results predicted the absence of AFB smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis with an

aThe time frame between the collection of the first sputum specimen and the second sputum specimen is greater than or equal to 8 hours. bThe time frame between the collection of the first sputum specimen and the second sputum specimen is less than 8 hours. cThe time frame between the collection of the first sputum specimen and the second sputum specimen was greater than or equal to 8 hours, and the time frame between the collection of the second sputum specimen and the third sputum specimen was greater than or equal to 8 hours. dThree AFB smears with less than 8 hour means that at least one of the time intervals between specimen collection was less than 8 hours apart.

To compare performance of the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected subjects, data from Study 2 were analyzed by smear status of specimens and HIV status of the population. Tables 7 and 8 compare the sensitivities and specificities of one Xpert MTB/RIF Assay result in specimens obtained from HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected subjects stratified by AFB smear-positive and AFB smear-negative results, respectively. For both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected subjects, the sensitivity of the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay for detection of MTB-complex was higher in AFB smear-positive specimens ( $1 0 0 . 0 \%$ and $9 7 . 8 \%$ , respectively) than in AFB smear-negative specimens $5 2 . 1 \%$ and $5 8 . 3 \%$ , respectively).

4. Clinical cut-off:

Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The likelihood that a positive test result is a true positive will vary based on the prevalence of the tuberculosis in the population being tested and whether the AFB smear is positive or negative.

In two multicenter prospective clinical evaluations of Xpert MTB/RIF Assay performance in subjects in the United States with suspected active TB, overall prevalence of culture-confirmed disease was $1 3 . 2 \%$ . Of subjects with culture confirmed TB, $7 1 . 6 \%$ were AFB smear-positive.

Hypothetical estimated positive and negative predictive values of MTB detection for different prevalence rates for detecting MTB using the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay are shown in Table 9. These calculations are based on hypothetical prevalences and the overall sensitivity and specificity (when compared to culture) observed in the multi-center clinical studies. The sensitivity of the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay for AFB smear-positive specimens was $9 9 . 4 \%$ (479/482) and sensitivity for AFB smear-negative specimens was $6 7 . 2 \%$ (135/201). Overall specificity of Xpert MTB/RIF Assay was $9 8 . 7 \%$ (1355/1373). The prevalence of MTB was $1 1 . 8 \%$ in the first U.S. prospective study and $1 4 . 2 \%$ in the second prospective U.S. study.

Predictive Values Based on Two Xpert MTB/RIF Assay Results

Hypothetical estimated positive and negative predictive values of MTB detection for different prevalence rates for detecting MTB using two Xpert MTB/RIF Assay results are shown in Table 10. These calculations are based on hypothetical prevalence and the overall sensitivity and specificity (when compared to culture) observed in the second of the two multi-center studies where two Xpert MTB/RIF Assays were performed on each subject. The sensitivity of two Xpert MTB/RIF Assay results for AFB smear-positive specimens was $100 \%$ (133/133) and the sensitivity for AFB smear-negative specimens was $6 9 . 4 \%$ (59/85). Overall specificity of two Xpert MTB/RIF Assay results was $9 7 . 9 \%$ (746/762).

Shelf-Life Testing Update:

The Xpert MTB/RIF Assay shelf-life studies have demonstrated acceptable stability using real-time stability results and linear regression analysis for a shelf-life of 24 months when reagents and cartridges are stored at $2 { - } 2 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

The shelf-life stability of the product was evaluated at four temperatures $( 5 ^ { \circ } \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $2 5 ^ { \circ } \pm$ $3 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , $3 5 ^ { \circ } \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and $4 5 ^ { \circ } \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ at predefined time points up to 36 months, following the study plan described in the $5 1 0 \mathrm { k }$ submission. At the 24 month time point and subsequent time points, the storage condition at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ was changed to $3 0 ^ { \circ } \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and the storage condition of $3 5 ^ { \circ } \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ was changed to $3 7 ^ { \circ } \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .
