# F. Device Description:

Test Principle:

The Great Basin Portrait™ GBS Assay on the PA500 Portrait™ Analyzer System utilizes automated hot-start PCR technology to amplify target nucleic acid sequences that are detected using species-specific S. agalactiae DNA hybridization probes immobilized on a modified silicon chip surface.

Genomic DNA is extracted from microbial cells and diluted to reduce potential inhibitors of the PCR reaction. In a duplex PCR, biotin-labeled primers enable amplification of specific nucleic acid sequences within a unique and conserved region of the $c f b$ gene (CAMP factor) for identification of S. agalactiae species and to an additional sample processing control (SPC) bacterial construct. Following PCR, biotin-labeled, amplified target DNA sequences are hybridized to sequence specific capture probes immobilized on the silicon chip surface, then incubated with anti-biotin antibody conjugated to the horseradish peroxidase enzyme (HRP). The unbound conjugate is removed by washing and tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) is added to produce a colored precipitate at the location of the probe/target sequence complex. The resulting signal is detected by the automated Portrait™ Optical Reader within the PA500 Portrait™ Analyzer System.

Test Device:

The Great Basin PA500 Portrait Analyzer System is a fully automated system that includes the Portrait Analyzer, single-use Portrait GBS Assay Test Cartridges, and the Portrait data analysis software. The PA500 Portrait Analyzer System is designed to perform automated sample preparation, PCR, and optical chip-based detection with integrated data analysis in approximately 90 minutes. The Great Basin Portrait™ GBS Assay utilizes automated hot-start PCR technology to amplify target nucleic acid sequences that are detected using species-specific S. agalactiae DNA hybridization probes immobilized on a modified silicon chip surface. The PA500 Portrait Analyzer System was recently granted clearance for use with the Portrait™ Toxigenic C. difficile Assay (DEN120013).

# H. Performance Data – Analytical Studies

# a. Analytical Sensitivity

The Limit of Detection (LoD) of the Portrait GBS Assay for Group B Streptococcus was assessed and confirmed by using strains of two different serotypes: ATCC strain BAA1177(serotype Ia) and ATCC strain 12403(serotype III). Each strain was spiked into negative LIM broth matrix and then serially diluted. Testing was performed on 20 replicates for each strain to establish the following LoDs in Table 1. For ATCC strain BAA1177, the LoD is reported as $5 { \times } 1 0 ^ { 3 } \ : { \mathrm { C F U } } / { \mathrm { m L } }$ (2.4 CFU/PCR) and for ATCC strain 12403 the LoD is $8 { \times } 1 0 ^ { 3 } \ : { \subset } \mathsf { F } \mathsf { U } / \mathsf { m L }$ (3.9 CFU/PCR).

# d. Microbial Interference

The Portrait GBS Assay was further evaluated for interference by the same panel of human DNA and 60 non-target microflora (51 bacterial, 5 yeast, and 4 viral stock strains; Table 3). The same high concentrations of potentially interfering DNA and microorganisms were spiked into negative clinical LIM broth matrix containing Group B Streptococcus cells at low positive concentrations of approximately 2X LoD, $1 { \times } 1 0 ^ { 4 } ~ \mathsf { C F U / m L }$ for ATCC strain BAA1177 (serotype Ia) and $1 . 6 { \times } 1 0 ^ { 4 } ~ \mathsf { C F U / m L }$ for ATCC strain 12403 (serotype III). A minimum of three replicate Portrait GBS Assays were performed for each of the human DNA and bacterial, yeast, and viral strains tested. With the exception of Enterococcus durans, none of the potentially interfering DNA or microflora interfered with the detection of either of the Group B Srepocs strains, esulting Grou  Streptoccus STIVE'calls s expece.nterferenc w observed for GBS strain ATCC 12403 at 2X LoD $( 1 . 6 { \times } 1 0 ^ { 4 } ~ \mathsf { C F U / m L } )$ in the presence of ${ 1 0 ^ { 6 } }$ CFU/mL $\boldsymbol { E }$ durans, but not when the GBS strain concentration was increased to 3X LoD $( 2 . 4 { \times } 1 0 ^ { 4 } \thinspace { \mathsf { C F U / m L } } )$ .

# e. Interfering Substances (Chemical Interference)

The Portrait GBS Assay was evaluated for chemical interference by the following panel of 21 different substances (Table 4). Substances were spiked into a negative clinical LIM broth matrix containing Group B Streptococcus cells at low positive concentrations of approximately 2X LoD, $1 { \times } 1 0 ^ { 4 } ~ \mathsf { C F U / m L }$ for ATCC strain BAA1177 (serotype Ia) and $1 . 6 { \times } 1 0 ^ { 4 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ for ATCC strain 12403 (serotype III).. A minimum of three replicate assays was performed with none of the chemical substances interfering with the detection of either Group B Streptococcus strain resulting in ‘Group B Streptococcus POSITIVE’ calls as expected.

# f. Carry-over/Cross-Contamination Study

A study was performed to assess the carry-over/cross-contamination of the Portrait GBS Assay by alternatively testing high titered Group B Streptococcus samples (ATCC 12403) spiked into negative clinical LIM broth matrix at $5 . 6 \times 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ CFU/mL followed by true negative samples comprised of only negative clinical LIM broth matrix. By running a series of alternating runs of high titered and negative samples on multiple Portrait Analyzers, any possible carry-over/cross-contamination would be detected.

Table 5 lists the alternating pattern of high positives (HP) and true negatives (TN) performed on six different Portrait Analyzers. All of the ‘calls’ were in concordance with expected ‘calls’. Therefore, there was no evidence of carry-over or cross-contamination in any of the tests.

# g. Reproducibility

For the Reproducibility studies of the Portrait GBS Assay, a panel of five prepared samples was tested consisting of two Group B Streptococcus strains: ATCC strain BAA1177 (serotype Ia), and ATCC strain 12403 (serotype III) at a ‘Moderate Positive’ concentration (3X LoD; $1 . 5 \times 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ CFU/mL for ATCC strain BAA1177 and $2 . 4 \times 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ CFU/mL for ATCC strain 12403) and a ‘Low Positive’ concentration (1.5X LoD; $7 . 5 { \times } 1 0 ^ { 3 } \mathsf { C F U / m L }$ for ATCC strain BAA1177 and $1 . 2 { \times } 1 0 ^ { 4 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ for ATCC strain 12403). These samples were made by spiking in the respective cultures into a negative clinical LIM broth matrix. In addition, a True Negative sample consisting of only a negative clinical LIM broth matrix was tested.

The Reproducibility studies were performed in-house and at two external clinical sites using blindcoded panels and six different GBS Assay cartridge lots. At each site, these studies were performed over the course of 5 non-consecutive days. For each day, two runs were performed with three replicates of each sample per run on each day. A minimum of two operators performed the runs at each site.

Table 6 summarizes the cumulative data for the Portrait GBS Assay across all three sites for the Reproducibility studies. Results for the Reproducibility studies of the Portrait GBS Assay were within the expected percent agreement across all three sites. The only exception to this was at Site 1 where 4 out of the 30 True Negatives run resulted in Group B Streptococcus POSITIVE calls instead of NEGATIVE calls. By definition, the True Negative samples consist of only negative clinical LIM broth matrix and therefore should not result in a positive call. Due to the high sensitivity of molecular-based PCR assays, such as the Portrait GBS Assay, laboratory workspace contamination is a possibility. The other two sites did not experience any issues with the True Negative samples run during this study, resulting in $100 \%$ agreement, as expected.

\* For Moderate Positive and Low Positive samples, $\%$ agreement $=$ 'Group B Streptococcus POSITIVE' calls/total runs. For True Negative samples, $\%$ agreement $= ^ { \cdot }$ 'Group B Streptococcus NEGATIVE' calls/total runs. ‡ This reflects 29 runs not 30 because an 'Invalid' run in this case was not re‐run.

# I. Performance Data – Prospective Clinical Studies

The clinical performance of the Portrait GBS Assay was determined in three sites in the United States. 448 compliant clinical samples (18-29 hr LIM broth enrichment) were run over the course of four months to evaluate the performance of the Portrait GBS Assay in comparison to the reference GBS clinical microbiology protocol. Samples were obtained according to the established guidelines for the collection of rectal/vaginal swabs from antepartum women (35 – 37 weeks) and enriched in LIM broth. Results from the studies of all three clinical sites combined are summarized in Table 7. The overall initial sample invalid rate was $2 . 0 1 \%$ . All invalids reported during the study were resolved upon repeated testing resulting in a final invalid rate of $0 \%$ . Overall assay performance vs. GBS culture testing is as follows: Overall assay performance vs. GBS culture testing is as follows: Sensitivity $= 9 7 . 9 \%$ , Specificity $=$ $9 6 . 0 \%$ , $\mathsf { P P V } = 8 6 . 9 \%$ , and $\mathsf { N P V } = 9 9 . 4 \%$ .
