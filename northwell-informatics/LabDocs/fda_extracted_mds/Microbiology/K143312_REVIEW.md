# L. Test Principle:

The PA500 Portrait Analyzer automates and integrates sample lysis, genomic DNA extraction, amplification, and detection of target sequence using PCR technology. An aliquot of the enriched media culture is placed into the sample port of the Test Cartridge for processing. Multiple fluidic channels are used to move reagents through chambers where reagent mixing and sample processing occur.

Briefly, genomic DNA is extracted from microbial cells and diluted to reduce potential inhibitors of the PCR reaction. In a duplex PCR, biotin-labeled primers enable amplification of specific nucleic acid sequences within the cfb gene for identification of S. agalactiae species and to an additional sample processing control (SPC) bacterial construct. Following PCR, biotin-labeled, amplified target DNA sequences are hybridized to sequence specific capture probes immobilized on the silicon chip surface, then incubated with anti-biotin antibody conjugated to the horseradish peroxidase enzyme. The unbound conjugate is removed by washing, and tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) is added to produce a colored precipitate at the location of the probe/target sequence complex. The resulting signal is detected by the automated Portrait Optical Reader within the PA500 Portrait Analyzer System. A self-contained waste chamber within the Test Cartridge collects and stores reagent waste. All reagents are contained within the assay test cartridge.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A panel of five samples with varying concentrations of two different GBS strains [ATCC BAA1177 (GBS serotype Ia) and ATCC 12403 (GBS serotype III)] were tested by 2 operators each in triplicate on 5 non-consecutive days at 3 sites for a total of 90 replicates (30 at each site) tested for each sample. Eight different GBS Assay cartridge lots were used across the three testing sites.

Moderate positive (2-3X LoD) and low positive (1-2X LoD) concentrations of GBS strains were made by spiking the respective cultures into a negative clinical LIM broth matrix. True Negative samples consisted of only a negative clinical LIM broth matrix. The negative clinical LIM broth matrix was defined as clinical specimens made up of LIM broth matrix previously inoculated with vaginal/rectal swabs and determined to be GBS negative. All study participants were blinded to the identity and expected result for each sample. The results are summarized in Table 1.

$^ \mathrm { a } 7$ invalid results and 5 aborts were recorded upon initial testing of samples across all sites. Upon re-testing, 11 samples were resolved and gave expected results. One sample was not re-run.

bThis reflects 29 runs out of 30 because one ‘Invalid’ run was not re-run.

The results for the reproducibility of the Portrait GBS Assay were within the expected percent agreement across all three sites.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not Applicable, The Portrait GBS Assay is a qualitative assay.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Controls

Sample Processing Control (SPC): The SPC controls for all analytical steps in the procedure for each cartridge tested. The SPC is a strain of protein-stabilized Bacillus cells lyophilized within the Portrait GBS Test Cartridge. The SPC is enzymatically lysed concurrently with the sample specimen. A region of the SPC is targeted for amplification by the PCR and detected by target-specific capture probes on the chip surface. The SPC may not amplify in a high-positive specimen, and in this case will not be required during the diagnostic calling of a GBS Positive. If the SPC fails in the absence of GBS target detection, the test result will be INVALID and the test should be repeated.

Fiducial Controls: Establish orientation of the silicon chip for image analysis.

Hybridization Detection Control (HC): The HC consists of a biotinylated oligonucleotide that is complementary to a capture probe attached to the silicon chip surface. The HC confirms the integrity of all reagents after PCR and steps leading to signal generation and detection. Failure of HC detection results in an INVALID call, which indicates the test should be repeated.

# LIM Broth Stability

The stability of LIM broth cultures was evaluated at room temperature for up to 16 hours and $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 5 days. Two strains of GBS (ATCC BAA1177 and ATCC 12403) were spiked into negative clinical LIM broth matrix at 2X and 10X LoD and held across the claimed storage times. Under conditions of this study, all samples were identified correctly with no difference in performance at any time point tested.

# d. Detection limit (LoD):

A study was performed to determine the limit of detection (LoD) of the Portrait GBS Assay with two different strains of GBS—ATCC strain 12403 (serotype III) and ATCC strain BAA1177 (serotype Ia). The strains tested were serially diluted into clinical LIM broth matrix previously inoculated with vaginal/rectal swabs and determined to be GBS negative. The initial analytical sensitivity was determined using 4-5 serial dilutions for each strain as shown in Table 2. The LoD was then established with 20 replicates of each strain. All concentrations were verified by colony counting (CFU/ml). The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration of GBS at which a minimum of 19 of 20 replicates were positive. The LoD results are shown in Table 3.

# g. Interference:

# Microbial Interference

The Portrait GBS Assay was evaluated for microbial interference using the same panel of human DNA and non-target microflora (bacteria, yeast, viral stock strains) tested in the Cross-Reactivity Study. Concentrations of potentially interfering DNA and microorganisms were similar to levels stated in the Cross-Reactivity Study. Strains were spiked into negative clinical LIM broth matrix containing GBS at a low positive concentration of 1-2X LoD. Studies assessed the detection of two GBS strains—ATCC BAA1177 (serotype Ia) and ATCC 12403 (serotype III). A minimum of three replicates for each target/non-target suspension was tested with the Portrait GBS Assay. Out of the test panel, only Enterococcus durans interfered with the detection of GBS. When GBS strain ATCC 12403 was spiked into culture negative LIM broth at a concentration of 1-2X LoD, 4/10 runs in the presence of Enterococcus durans yielded a GBS “negative” call. However, when the concentration of ATCC 12403 was increased to 3X LoD, no interference was observed with Enterococcus durans in $6 / 6$ runs. A statement reporting Enterococcus durans interference with GBS detection was added to the package insert. Three ‘Invalid’ calls were recorded during the microbial interference study; however, when all three invalids were re-run, the correct call was observed.

# Interfering Substances

The potentially inhibiting substances listed in the table below were tested with the Portrait GBS Assay in triplicate. Results of the study yielded no inhibitory effects for GBS positive specimens in the presence of any of the interfering substances. All replicates of positive specimens using ATCC BAA1177 (serotype Ia) and ATCC 12403 (serotype III) were correctly reported as ‘GBS positive’ at 1-2X LoD concentration with the assay. Only one ‘Invalid’ run was reported with contraceptive gel and strain ATCC 12403. The list of potentially interfering substances is shown in Table 6.

# Carry-over/Cross-contamination Study

A Carry-over/Cross-contamination Study was conducted for the Portrait GBS Assay by alternatively testing high titered GBS samples $\mathrm { ( > 1 0 ^ { 7 } C F U / m l ) }$ followed by true negative samples. Six runs were performed on each of six Portrait GBS analyzers (6 instruments x 6 runs $= 3 6$ total runs). Samples were prepared in negative clinical LIM broth matrix. All results yielded the expected results with no cross-contamination events reported.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not Applicable. Performance of the assay was evaluated in comparison to the gold standard/reference method (LIM broth culture).   
b. Matrix comparison: Not Applicable.

a. Clinical Sensitivity:

Performance characteristics of the Portrait GBS Assay were evaluated at 3 institutions in the U.S. using the PA500 Portrait Analyzer System. Subjects included individuals whose standard of care screening called for the collection of vaginal/rectal swab specimens for GBS testing. Specimens for the clinical study consisted of excess leftover de-identified LIM broth cultures from pregnant women at 35 – 37 weeks of gestation. These specimens were initially collected using a standard double swab (vaginal and rectal) for GBS testing, placed into transport media, and then inoculated into LIM broth for an overnight incubation (18-29 hours) at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ $( + / - 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . An aliquot of leftover LIM broth was used for testing by the Portrait GBS Assay, reference culture method, and comparator molecular methods.

Over the course of the Clinical Study, 518 samples were collected from all three sites. 70 samples did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria (incubation between 18-29 hours) and, therefore, were not included for the purpose of performance evaluation. The remaining 448 clinical specimens were used to evaluate the performance of the Portrait GBS Assay in comparison to the reference culture method. Enriched LIM broths were subcultured to $5 \%$ sheep blood agar plates and incubated at 24 hours at $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \left( + / - 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \right)$ with $5 \% \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ . If no growth was observed, then plates were incubated for an additional 24 hours. Suspected GBS colonies (both hemolytic and nonhemolytic) were gram stained and tested with catalase reagent. Gram-positive, catalase negative colonies were confirmed as GBS by latex agglutination testing.

The Portrait GBS Assay demonstrated an overall sensitivity and specificity for detection of GBS colonization of $9 7 . 9 \%$ and $9 6 . 0 \%$ , respectively, relative to the reference culture method. The initial invalid rate for the Portrait GBS Assay was $2 . 0 1 \%$ (9/448) across all three sites. After re-testing, all invalids were resolved yielding a final invalid rate of $0 \%$ for the Portrait GBS Assay. Table 7 and Table 8 show performance of the Portrait GBS Assay across all sites and for each site, respectively.
