3. Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing - $2 4 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ Informational Supplement, Ml00-S24 (QC parameters only)

# L. Test Principle:

The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are miniaturizations of the broth dilution susceptibility test which have been dehydrated. Various antimicrobial agents are diluted in Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with calcium and magnesium to concentrations bridging the rage of clinical interest. Breakpoint Combo panels use concentrations equivalent to the categorical breakpoints of FDA and/or CLSI. After inoculation and rehydration with a standardized suspension of organism and incubation of $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for a minimum of 16 hours, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test organism is determined by observing the lowest antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility data for 10 isolates including one $E$ . casseliflavus, one $E$ . faecalis, two $E .$ . faecium, three S. aureus (one MSSA and two MRSA), two S. epidermidis and one S. haemolyticus and one QC strain ( $E$ . faecalis ATCC 29212) were generated at 5 clinical trial sites. Organism selection was based on the intended use of the antimicrobial agent. Each strain was tested at each site in triplicate over three days using 2 inoculation methods (Turbidity and Prompt) and 3 reading methods (manual, WalkAway Instrument and autoSCAN-4 Instrument).

The mode of the test panel MIC results was determined for each isolate. MIC results at each site were compared to the mode value for each strain. Results were considered in agreement if the test panel MIC was equal to or within $\pm \nobreakspace 1 \nobreakspace$ dilution of the mode for that isolate. Agreement was calculated assuming any off-scale results were within one well from the mode (best case) and by assuming any off-scale results were greater than one well from the mode (worst case). Data were analyzed for all dilutions of Vancomycin $( 0 . 2 5 { - } 6 4 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ ). The agreement was calculated for each site and for the five sites combined.

For all sites combined, agreement within $1 \pm$ dilution from the mode for all inoculation and reading methods was $> 9 5 \%$ for best case and for worst case scenarios. The reproducibility study results are acceptable. The results of the best case scenarios are shown in Table 2 below.

The results were acceptable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

This $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ application was submitted to demonstrate that MicroScan Dried GramPositive MIC/Combo panels with reformulated vancomycin (Test panels) are substantially equivalent to frozen CLSI reference panels (Reference panels). Device performance was evaluated in a clinical trial that included gram-positive isolates.

A total of 128 challenge isolates were tested (40 Enterococcus spp, 15 MRSA, 21 MSSA, 17 CNS, 9 VRSA and 26 VISA). Of the 128 challenge isolates, the expected results for 71 strains were susceptible, and 25 strains were Resistant. The 9 VRSA strains were tested at an internal site, while the rest of the isolates were tested at external sites.

A total of 947 clinical isolates were tested (166 Enterococcus spp, 205 MRSA, 207 MSSA and 369 CNS). Six hundred eighty-seven (687) organisms were fresh and two hundred sixty (260) were stock isolates. The results were compared to the reference method or expected results. Of the 947 gram positive isolates tested, 882 were identified by the Reference panel to be Susceptible, and 62 isolates were identified as Resistant.

Tables 5-8 below demonstrate the performance for each group of isolates (MRSA, MSSA, CNS and Enterococcus species) based on essential agreement and category agreement for the overall performance of the clinical and challenge isolates. Data is shown for each inoculum preparation method (Turbidity and Prompt) and reading (Overnight Manual, Walk-Away, and autoScan4). Accurate detection of resistance requires extended incubation times of 24 hours for Enterococci. Staphylococci results were read after 16-20 hours incubation $1 8 \small { - } 2 0 \mathrm { h }$ for autoSCAN-4 instrument reads). The results were comparable to those obtained at 24 hours with the reference method. The performance data for VRSA and VISA is shown in Tables 9 and 10, respectively. Table 11 shows the overall performance summary for all organisms.

EA-Essential Agreement CA-Category Agreement R-Resistant Isolates min-minor discrepancies maj-major discrepancies vmj-very major discrepancies

Evaluable results are those that fall within the test range of the reference method and could also be on-scale with the new device if within plus/minus one dilution. Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the result of the reference method and that of MicroScan $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the MicroScan $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ result.

The overall combined $\% \mathrm { E A }$ and $\% \mathrm { C A }$ consistently meet the acceptance criteria of greater than or equal to $90 \%$ .

# MIC Trend Analysis:

Using the data provided by the sponsor in the diagonal table format recommended in the AST Guidance, an analysis was conducted to check for trending in MIC values.

As summarized in Table 12 below, a lower reading trend was observed in the overall performance of Coagulase negative Staphylococcus for the turbidity inoculation method in the three reading methods (overnight manual, WalkAway and autoScan4) compared to the CLSI broth micro-dilution method, which raises concerns for potential very major errors.

This trending and the potential for occurrence of major and very major errors(s) for Vancomycin when testing Coagulase negative S. aureus and MRSA and MSSA was also addressed by adding the following footnotes in the in labeling:

· Footnote 1: “MicroScan vancomycin MIC values tended to be one doubling dilution lower when testing coagulase negative Staphyloccus by the turbidity inoculation method using manual, WalkAway and autoScan4 reading methods compared to reference broth micro-dilution. Footnote 2: “MicroScan vancomycin MIC values tended to be one doubling dilution higher when testing S. aureus (MR and MS) by the Prompt inoculation method using manual, WalkAway and AutoScan-4 reading methods compared to reference broth micro-dilution.

# Growth Rate:

All isolates tested during the clinical (efficacy) trials grew in both the frozen reference panel and the dried MicroScan panels.

# Prompt Hold Study:

An external study was performed to determine the agreement of results obtained with the Prompt inoculation method using hold times of 0 hours and 4 hours prior to inoculation of the panels. Results of 4-hour holds were compared to 0-hour hold using the same inoculum and with expected results as determined by the reference method. Testing was performed with all three read methods (WA, AS4 and manually). The results showed that there is no statistical difference in the Vancomycin dried result between 4 hours and 0 hours to all read. There is no statistical

difference in the Vancomycin dried results compared to the frozen results at 0 hour and 4 hour hold time for all read methods. The performance was acceptable for all organisms tested. No major or very major errors were noted with each method inoculated after extended hold times. Only minor errors were observed.
