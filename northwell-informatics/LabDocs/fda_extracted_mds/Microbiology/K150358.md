# 4) Description of the Device:

The Gold Standard Diagnostics AIX1000 Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) Automated Test System in a non-treponemal test for the qualitative determination of reagin antibodies in human serum to aid in the diagnosis of syphilis. This test is also used to detect non-treponemal antibodies in samples serially diluted to establish titer information. The system consists of the Gold Standard Diagnostics RPR test reagents and the Gold Standard Diagnostics AIX1000 Agglutination Analyzer. The AIX1000 Analyzer delivers serum from collection tubes into test wells. After antigen suspension is added, the test wells are then incubated while being shaken. An onboard camera creates a high resolution image. The image is then analyzed by the proprietary software algorithm to produce a result.

The RPR test reagents consist of a reactive control, a non-reactive control, and the antigen suspended in a carbon solution. When the antigen is mixed with sera, if antibodies are present, they will bind to the antigen and form black flocculants due to the presence of carbon particles. If no antibodies are present, then the carbon particles remain evenly distributed.

The antigen used in the Gold Standard Diagnostics AIX1000 Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) Automated Test System is a modified VDRL carbon antigen. The formulation is the same as that established by the Center for Disease Control (CDC)1  containing $0 . 0 3 \%$ cardiolipin, $0 . 9 \%$ cholesterol, and $0 . 2 1 \%$ lecithin.

The kit also includes untreated, 48 well reaction plates a reactive control and a non-reactive control.

# Cross Reactivity

The study was conducted to evaluate potential cross reactivity from different disease conditions. A panel of antibodies from 17 different conditions (10 viral, 3 bacterial, and 4 autoimmune conditions) was obtained from serum brokers who confirmed the presence of each respective disease marker. The samples were tested on the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System. Each condition tested 10-16 individual patient samples. Reactive and non-reactive controls were run on each day of testing. The results are summarized below:

\*Heterophiles samples were tested for infectious mononucleosis (EBV and un-related non-EBV heterophile antibodies).

# Interfering Substances

The effect of potential interfering substances on samples using the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System was evaluated. The panel consisted of seven endogenous substances and two prescription drugs that could be used to treat syphilis patients. Five samples, one non-reactive and four reactive samples (with a concentration of 1:2, 1:4, 1:16, and 1:64 from four individual patients), were obtained from a serum broker and were tested in the presence (interferents spiked in-house at the concentration described below) or absence of interferents. The qualitative (non-titer) result was recorded for each sample. The concentrations selected were recommended in the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute standard document CLSI EP7-A2. Reactive and non-reactive controls were run on each day of testing. For all substances, the RPR samples remained positive, therefore the tested substances did not affect the performance of the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System.

# Precision

To test the precision of the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System, a within-lab precision study was conducted. This study was conducted in-house with clinical samples at the following concentrations: a low RPR reactivity $( < 1 { : } 8 )$ , a moderately reactive (1:16), a reactive (1:64), highly reactive (1:128), and a non-reactive serum (the highly reactive sample was a pooled sample, while all the other samples were individual patient sera). Each concentration level was tested in replicates of nine. These nine replicates were spread across five panels that were tested every day for five consecutive days by one operator using one instrument. The sample panels were masked and randomized. Reactive and non-reactive controls were run on each day of testing. The results are summarized below.

# Carry-over

The purpose of the carry-over study was to uncover the presence of contamination in negative specimens due to carry-over of RPR antibodies during sample processing on the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System. The study was conducted over three consecutive days on a single AIX1000 instrument. One reactive (1:64), one highly reactive (1:128) and two negative samples were tested over five runs. The samples used were from individual patients (not pooled). The qualitative (nontiter) result was recorded for each sample. Highly reactive samples were alternated with non-reactive samples (reactive 1 with non-reactive 1; reactive 1 with non-reactive 2- tested twice; reactive 2 with non-reactive 1; and reactive 2 with non-reactive 2) 96 times per run. All 480 replicates of the negative samples were reported as non-reactive, therefore, no evidence of carry-over was observed.

# 6(b2): Clinical Studies:

# i. Prospectively Collected Samples

Prospective sample collection was conducted at two geographically distinct (Southeastern and Western United States) reference laboratories that received samples from local clinics, hospitals, and doctor’s offices. Testing was conducted at three sites (one in house and two locations that represented the intended use sited for the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System. For all testing sites, reactive and non-reactive external controls were tested with the assay on each day of testing. All 765 serum samples were collected prospectively from patient samples with a physician’s order to perform syphilis testing. Samples were stored frozen $( - 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for a maximum of five months before testing. All samples that were shipped, were transported and stored frozen until testing. All three sites performed their own comparator testing.

All prospectively collected samples were “de-identified”, therefore, only pregnancy and HIV status was recorded. No information regarding gender, age, syphilis stage, or antibiotic use was available.

Seven hundred sixty five (765) serum samples were tested on both the GSD RPR Automated Test System and on the comparator device (Arlington Scientific Inc. RPR Card Test for syphilis on the

ASiManager-AT Analyzer). The initial tests resulted in 26 invalid results (invalid rate of $3 . 4 \%$ with $9 5 \%$ CI: $2 . 3 3 \% \sim 4 . 9 3 \% )$ . All 26 samples were re-tested and gave non-reactive results. The comparison of results for the prospectively collected clinical samples is summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=2>Prospective Samples</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>Comparator Device</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Reactive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Non-reactive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>GSD AIX1000RPR Test System</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Reactive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>21</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1*</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>22</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Non-reactive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1*</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>742</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>743</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>22</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>743</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>765</td></tr></table>

\*The two discrepant samples were tested on a third FDA cleared RPR assay. Both samples were nonreactive on the third RPR assay.

The positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement of the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System with the comparator device (along with their $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals) are $9 5 . 5 \%$ (C.I. $7 7 . 2 \% - 9 9 . 9 \%$ and $9 9 . 9 \%$ (C.I. $9 9 . 3 \% - 1 0 0 \% ) , \%$ ), respectively.

To further investigate the serologic status of the non-treponemal antibody positive samples $\left( \mathrm { N T ^ { + } } \right)$ , the samples that gave a reactive result either by the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System or by the comparator device were further tested on an FDA cleared treponemal (TP) assay. Of the 21 samples that were non-treponemal antibody reactive on both the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System and on the comparator device, only 18 $1 8 / 2 1 = 8 5 . 7 \%$ had enough volume for further testing; all 18 samples were positive for TP antibodies. The one sample that was $\mathrm { N T + }$ on the GSD AIX1000 Automated Test System and non-treponemal non-reactive (NT-) on the comparator device was negative for TP antibodies. The one sample that was NT- on the GSD AIX1000 Automated Test System and $\mathrm { N T + }$ on the comparator device was negative for TP antibodies. The 742 samples that were concordant non-reactive with the test device and the comparator device did not receive further TP testing $7 4 2 / 7 6 5 = 9 7 . 0 \%$ ).

# ii. Retrospectively Collected Samples

In addition, 2,246 retrospectively collected samples from patients referred for syphilis testing were tested on the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System and on the comparator device. The samples were obtained from sample brokers who collect from multiple sites across the United States. The samples were collected between January 2005 and July 2014 and stored at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ until the time of testing. Samples included 607 men and 666 women ranging in age from 10 to 98 years $( { \mathrm { m e a n } } = 3 5 $ years. The gender and age of the remaining samples were not disclosed). All samples were tested inhouse by a single operator. Reactive and non-reactive controls were tested with the assay on each day of testing. The initial tests resulted with six invalid results (invalid rate of $0 . 2 7 \%$ with $9 5 \%$ CI: $0 . 1 2 \% \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 0 . 5 8 \%$ ). All six samples were re-tested and gave one reactive and five non-reactive results. The results are summarized below:

\*The 31 discrepant samples were tested on a third FDA cleared RPR assay. Of the 16 GSD nonreactive and comparator device reactive samples, the third RPR assay called 12 reactive and 4 nonreactive. Of the 15 GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System reactive and comparator device nonreactive samples, the third RPR assay called 11 reactive and 4 non-reactive.

The positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement of the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System with the comparator device (along with their $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals) are $9 7 . 2 \%$ (C.I. $9 5 . 5 \% - 9 8 . 4 \%$ and $9 9 . 1 \%$ (C.I. $9 8 . 5 \% - 9 9 . 5 \%$ , respectively.

To further investigate the serologic status of the non-treponemal antibody positive samples $\left( \mathrm { N T ^ { + } } \right)$ , the samples that gave a reactive result either by the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System or the comparator device were further tested on an FDA cleared treponemal (TP) assay. Of the 556 samples that were non-treponemal antibody reactive on both the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System and on the comparator device, only 404 had enough volume for further TP $4 0 4 / 5 5 6 = 7 2 . 7 \%$ ). Of the 15 samples that were $\mathrm { N T + }$ on the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System and non-reactive for non-treponemal antibodies (NT-) on the comparator device, only three had enough volume for further TP testing $( 9 / 1 6 = 5 6 . 3 \%$ ). Of the 16 samples that were NT- on the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System and $\mathrm { N T + }$ on the comparator device, only nine had enough volume for further TP testing. A total of 416 samples that were reactive by either the test device or the comparator device received further TP testing. Samples that were concordant non-reactive with the test device and the comparator device did not receive further TP testing. The results are summarized below:

\*Samples with concordant non-reactive results by the comparator device and the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System did not receive further TP testing.

Three hundred thirty (330) of the retrospective collected samples were tested for titer (330/587 samples collected $= 5 6 . 2 \%$ ). The frequency distribution of titer results from samples that are RPR reactive on the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System is shown in the figure below:

# iii. Retrospectively Collected Samples from Special Populations

# Pregnant Women

In addition, 250 samples that were non-reactive for non-treponemal antibodies (NT-) were retrospectively collected from pregnant women at one site (Southeastern United States). The age of these women ranged from 15-44 years old (median $= 2 9$ years old) The samples were collected between July 2012 and August 2013 and stored at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until the time of testing. To create nontreponemal antibody reactive $\left( \mathrm { N T ^ { + } } \right)$ samples, sera from 30 individual pregnant women were collected and spiked with a pool created by combining highly reactive RPR positive samples.

Sera from 30 pregnant women were obtained and were tested on an FDA cleared Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) test to confirm the pregnancy status. All sera gave a positive HCG result. The 30 sera were then spiked with a pool of highly reactive (1:128 and 1:64) RPR positive samples. No more than $10 \%$ of the volume from the sera of pregnant women was supplanted by spiking. The spiked sera were tested again on the HCG test to confirm a positive result.

These samples were tested on the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System and on the comparator device. All samples were tested in-house by a single operator. The identity of the samples was masked. Reactive and non-reactive controls were tested with the assay on each day of testing. No invalid results were obtained. The results are summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=2>Pregnant Women</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>Comparator Device</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Reactive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Non-reactive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>GSD AIX1000 RPRTest System</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Reactive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>30</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>30</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Non-reactive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>250</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>250</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>30</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>250</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>280</td></tr></table>

# HIV Positive Individuals

In addition, 250 samples that were non-reactive for non-treponemal antibodies (NT-) and 30 samples that were reactive for non-treponemal antibodies $\left( \mathrm { N T ^ { + } } \right)$ were retrospectively collected from HIV positive individuals at four sites (one Southeastern, one Mid-Western, and two Western States). The age ranged from 19-60 years old (median $= ~ 4 1$ years). Sixteen (16) women and 71 men were included in this group (the age and gender of the other samples were not disclosed). The samples were collected between February 2012 and June 2015 and stored at $- 2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ until the time of testing.

These samples were tested on the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System and the comparator device. All samples were tested in-house by a single operator. The identity of the samples was masked and the samples from HIV positive individuals were randomized with samples collected from HIV negative individuals. Reactive and non-reactive controls were tested with the assay on each day of testing. No invalid results were obtained. The results are summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=2>HIV Positive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>Comparator Device</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Reactive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Non-reactive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>GSD AIX1000 RPRTest System</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Reactive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>30</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>30</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Non-reactive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>250</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>250</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>30</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>250</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>280</td></tr></table>

The positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement of the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System with the comparator (along with their $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals) are $100 \%$ (C.I. $9 0 . 5 \% - 1 0 0 \%$ and $100 \%$ (C.I. $9 8 . 8 \% - 1 0 0 \%$ ), respectively.

# Apparently Healthy Individuals

To determine the percentage of RPR reactivity with the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System in a population of apparently healthy individuals, 100 serum samples prospectively collected from healthy individuals not at risk for syphilis and for whom a syphilis test had not been ordered (samples were submitted to the source laboratories for routine chemistry testing) were tested with the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System. All 100 samples were non-reactive with the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System.

The percentage of RPR reactivity with the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test system in the 765 prospective serum samples collected from two geographically distinct regions of the United States from patients with a physician’s order to perform syphilis testing, $2 . 9 \%$ (22/765) were reactive with the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System.

# Correlation with Clinically Diagnosed Syphilis Sera – Various Stages

A sample panel of sera collected from patients clinically positive for syphilis at various stages of the disease were purchased. The sera consisted of treated and untreated samples at the primary, secondary, and latent stages of syphilis. The age, gender, and collection dates for the samples were not disclosed. The primary syphilis samples given were characterized by documented genital lesion with positive dark field microscopy (if performed) and with reactive treponemal test. The secondary syphilis samples were characterized by documented rash or mucous patches or condyloma lata with reactive treponemal test. And the latent syphilis samples were characterized by having reactive treponemal and non-treponemal test with a non-reactive non-treponemal test for more than a year or for an unknown duration of infection.

The sera were tested on both the GSD AIX1000 RPR Automated Test System and on the comparator device. The sample panel members were masked and the order of testing was randomized. There were no invalid results reported in any of the tests. The results are summarized below:

\*Note: The results of the sample population tested may not be consisted with what has been reported in the literature. It is important to perform follow-up testing on patients suspected of having syphilis.

# 7 Conclusion:

From the data, we conclude that the Gold Standard Diagnostics AIX1000 Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) Automated Test System is substantially equivalent to the predicate device – the Arlington Scientific Inc. (ASI) RPR Card Test for syphilis on the ASiManager-AT Analyzer (K111356).
