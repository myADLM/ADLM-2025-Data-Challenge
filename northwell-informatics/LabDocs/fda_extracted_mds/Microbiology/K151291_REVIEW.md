1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device(s).

Trade Name: BD Veritor™ System Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ (Physician Office Kit) 510(k) numbers: K112277, K132259, K132692

2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for use and package labeling.

Submitter provided a checklist indicating “yes” to the statement “Indications for Use of the proposed device are unchanged from the legally marketed device (predicate).

3. A description of the device MODIFICATIONS demonstrating that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.

Submitter provided the following statement indicating that the device’s scientific technology is unchanged.

The BD VeritorTM System Flu $\mathsf { A } + \mathsf { B }$ (Physician Office Kit) is substantially equivalent to the current legally marketed device, BD VeritorTM System Flu $\mathsf { A } + \mathsf { B }$ (Physician Office Kit). Modifications made to the BD VeritorTM System Flu $\mathsf { A } + \mathsf { B }$ (Physician Office Kit) product did not change the intended use of the device or the fundamental scientific technology.

The modification presented in this 510(k) consisted of an expanded analytical reactivity table to include additional reactivity information for nine strains of the influenza A virus and five strains of the influenza B virus, including the minimal concentration detected for these 14 influenza viruses. The following tables show the viruses tested for this submission and the minimal detected concentration:

The BDVeritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B is a differentiated test,such that influenza A viral antigens can be distinguished frominfluenza B viral antigens from a single processed sample using asingle device. The test is to be used as an aid in the diagnosis ofinfluenza A and B viral infections. A negative test is presumptive andit is recommended that these results be confirmed by viral culture oran FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay. Outside theU.S., a negative test is presumptive and it is recommended thatthese results be confirmed by viral culture or a molecular assaycleared for diagnostic use in the country of use. FDA has not clearedthis device for use outside of the U.S. Negative test results do notpreclude influenza viral infection and should not be used as the solebasis for treatment or other patient management decisions.

# Differences:

The modified device differs from the currently marketed BD Veritor™ System Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ (Physician Office Kit) in the following way:

The labeling has been updated to reflect the addition of influenza A and B strain analytical reactivity data and the lowest concentration detected for each of the tested strains. Footnotes explaining TCID50/mL, EID50/mL, CEID50/mL, and HA have been added to the “Analytical Sensitivity (Limit of Detection)” table and the “Strain Reactivity with Influenza A and B Viruses” table in the package insert.

# 5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:

a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis BD’s Risk Assessment process is based on a BD Product Risk Management procedure which meets the requirement for risk management as set forth in ISO 14971:2007 and EN ISO 14971:2012. Using this procedure, the following are estimated:

the Hazard,   
the Adverse Effect(Harm to Patient),   
the Potential Causes of the Hazard,   
The probability of severity and the probability of occurrence are estimated.

Based on a resulting calculated Risk Index\*, Risk Control Measures are identified, required verification and validation activities are determined, and verification of the effectiveness of risk control measures is determined.

\*Risk Index:

Insignificant (GR) – individual risks in the green region are deemed negligible in comparison with other risks and in relation to the benefit of using the product. Even if the risk falls into this region, the risk must be reduced as far as possible. For risks falling into this region, the medical benefit is considered to outweigh the individual residual risk since the combination of the occurrence and severity is considered low. These risks do not require individual risk benefit analysis. Because risk of harm in this region are deemed negligible, risk control measures implemented in this region, will not require documented verification of risk control measure effectiveness.

Investigate (YE) –individual risks in the yellow region are not negligible in comparison with other risks, therefore further risk reduction must be investigated. This category requires evaluation for risk reduction and once all possible risk control measures have been implemented, the residual risk is not reduced to insignificant (GR) is not possible, the individual item in this region require a documented risk/benefit analysis to document acceptance of the residual risk (See Attachment 3 for a Risk Benefit Analysis model.

Unacceptable/Intolerable (RE) – individual risks in the red region are unacceptable. This region requires the implementation of risk control measures to reduce the risk. In general, BDDS products should not have items with residual risks falling into this region. However, in an exceptional and rare circumstance, these items may be documented in the risk/benefit analysis with approval by Medical Affairs at a director level or higher.

# RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS:

The results of the analysis indicated an initial possible combination of severity and occurrence that fell into S-3/P-3 category (i.e., Risk Index of “Investigate”):

b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities required, including methods or tests used, and acceptance criteria to be applied

To implement the indicated investigation, Protocol SDSP15001 was developed and approved based on previously accepted FDA submissions regarding strain reactivity. Specific influenza strains selection for this reactivity study was based on new circulating strains for 2015/2016 Influenza Season, as well as availability of other strains through CDC and WHO. Acceptability criteria were the ability of the BD Veritor™ System Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ (Physician Office Kit) to detect these additional influenza strains.

Analytical Reactivity Testing was conducted as described in section 3, Device Modifications.

BD Veritor™ System Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ (Physician Office Kit) was successful in detecting all strains tested. The acceptance criteria were fully met. The package insert was updated to include the data obtained during this strain reactivity testing. The results of the strain reactivity testing reduced the probability of occurrence from P-3 to P-1 and reduced the Risk Index to the “Insignificant” category:

c) Declaration of Conformity with Design Controls

A “Declaration of Conformity with Design Controls” statement was submitted for the validation activities and manufacturing facility by the Director of Regulatory Affairs and Quality Systems. The statement indicates that;

1) To the best of knowledge of the Director of Regulatory Affairs and Quality Systems, the verification activities, as required by the risk analysis, for the modification were performed by the designated individual(s) and the results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance criteria were met. 2) The manufacturing facility, BD Rapid Diagnostics Co Ltd, is in conformance with the design control requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820. 30 and the records are available for review.

# 6. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary, and the Indications for Use Enclosure.

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular modifications and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
