Device Name BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathrm { A + B }$ (Laboratory Kit)

Indications for Use (Describe)

The BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathrm { A } { + } \mathrm { B }$ is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the direct and qualitative detection of influenza A and B viral nucleoprotein antigens from nasopharyngeal wash, aspirate and swab in transport media samples from symptomatic patients. The BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathrm { A + B }$ is a differentiated test, such that influenza A viral antigens can be distinguished from influenza B viral antigens from a single processed sample using a single device. The test is to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza A and B viral infections. A negative test is presumptive and it is recommended that these results be confirmed by viral culture or an FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay. Outside the U.S. a negative test is presumptive and it is recommended that these results be confirmed by viral culture or a molecular assay cleared for diagnostic use in the country of use. FDA has not cleared this device outside the U.S. Negative test results do not preclude influenza viral infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. The test is not intended to detect influenza C antigens.

Performance characteristics for influenza A and B nasopharyngeal (NP) washes/aspirates were established during January through March of 2011 when influenza viruses A/2009 H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria lineage, and B/Yamagata lineage were the predominant influenza viruses in circulation according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the CDC entitled “Update: Influenza Activity—United States, 2010-2011 Season, and Composition of the 2011-2012 Influenza Vaccine.” Performance characteristics may vary against other emerging influenza viruses.

Performance characteristics for influenza A and B NP swabs in transport media were established during January through April of 2012 when influenza viruses A/2009 H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria lineage, and B/Yamagata lineage were the predominant influenza viruses in circulation according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the CDC entitled “Update: Influenza Activity—United States, 2011-2012 Season, and Composition of the 2012-2013 Influenza Vaccine.” Performance characteristics may vary against other emerging influenza viruses.

If infection with a novel influenza virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to the state or local health department for testing. Virus culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION :

The BD Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ test is a chromatographic assay to qualitatively detect influenza A and B viral antigens in respiratory specimens. The patient specimen is mixed in a prefilled unitized tube containing RV Reagent C and added to the test device. RV Reagent C contains mucolytic agents that function to break down mucus in a patient specimen thereby exposing viral antigens and enhancing detection in the assay device. Processed specimens are expressed through a filter tip into a single sample well on the BD Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ test device.

The specimen is mixed and added to the test device where influenza A or influenza B viral antigens bind to anti-influenza antibodies conjugated to detector particles on the BD Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ test strip. The antigen-conjugate complex migrates across the test strip to the reaction area and is captured by an antibody line on the membrane. The assay utilizes a proprietary enhanced colloidal-gold particle at the test lines as the means for identifying the presence of influenza A or B viral antigens. The BD Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ test devices are designed with five spatially-distinct zones including positive and negative control line positions, separate test line positions for the target analytes, and a background zone. The test lines for the target analytes are labeled on the test device as ‘A’ for Flu A position, and ‘B’ for Flu B position. The onboard positive control ensures the sample has flowed correctly and is indicated on the test device as $" C '$ . Two of the five distinct zones on the test device are not labeled. These two zones are an onboard negative control line and an assay background zone. The onboard negative control zone addresses non-specific signal generation and is not labeled on the test device. The remaining zone is used to measure the assay background and is also not labeled.

The BD Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ assay incorporates an active negative control feature in each test to identify and compensate for sample-related, nonspecific signal generation. The BD Veritor™ System Reader uses a proprietary algorithm which subtracts nonspecific signal at the negative control line from the signal present at both the Flu A and Flu B test lines. If the resultant test line signal is above a pre-selected assay cutoff, the specimen is scored as positive. If the resultant test line signal is below the cutoff, the specimen is scored as negative. Use of the active negative control feature allows the BD Veritor™ System reader to correctly interpret test results that cannot be scored visually because the human eye is unable to accurately perform the subtraction of the nonspecific signal.

# 3. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The BD Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ test is a chromatographic assay to qualitatively detect influenza A and B viral antigens in samples processed from respiratory specimens. The processed specimen is added to the test device where influenza A or influenza B viral antigens bind to anti-influenza antibodies conjugated to detector particles on the $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ test strip. The antigen-conjugate complex migrates across the test strip to the reaction area and is captured by an antibody line on the membrane. Results are interpreted by the BD Veritor™ System Reader, a portable electronic device which uses a reflectance-based measurement method to evaluate the line signal intensities on the assay test strip, and applies specific algorithms to determine the presence or absence of any target analyte(s). A liquid crystal display (LCD) on the instrument communicates the results to the operator.

# 4. PRINCIPLE OF PROCEDURE

The BD Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ test is a chromatographic assay to qualitatively detect influenza A and B viral antigens in respiratory specimens. The patient specimen is mixed in a prefilled unitized tube containing RV Reagent C and added to the test device. RV Reagent C contains mucolytic agents that function to break down mucus in a patient specimen thereby exposing viral antigens and enhancing detection in the assay device. Processed specimens are expressed through a filter tip into a single sample well on the BD Flu $A { + } B$ test device.

The specimen is mixed and added to the test device where influenza A or influenza B viral antigens bind to anti-influenza antibodies conjugated to detector particles on the BD Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ test strip. The antigen-conjugate complex migrates across the test strip to the reaction area and is captured by an antibody line on the membrane. The assay utilizes a proprietary enhanced colloidal-gold particle at the test lines as the means for identifying the presence of influenza A or B viral antigens.

The BD Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ test devices are designed with five spatially-distinct zones including positive and negative control line positions, separate test line positions for the target analytes, and a background zone. The test lines for the target analytes are labeled on the test device as ‘A’ for Flu A position, and ‘B’ for Flu B position. The onboard positive control ensures the sample has flowed correctly and is indicated on the test device as $" C '$ . Two of the five distinct zones on the test device are not labeled.

The BD Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ assay incorporates an active negative control feature in each test to identify and compensate for sample-related, nonspecific signal generation. The BD Veritor™ System Reader uses a proprietary algorithm which subtracts nonspecific signal at the negative control line from the signal present at both the Flu A and Flu B test lines. If the resultant test line signal is above a pre-selected assay cutoff, the specimen is scored as positive. If the resultant test line signal is below the cutoff, the specimen is scored as negative. Use of the active negative control feature allows the BD Veritor™ System reader to correctly interpret test results that cannot be scored visually because the human eye is unable to accurately perform the subtraction of the nonspecific signal.

The BD Veritor™ System Reader measures the amount of light reflected from various zones along the assay strip. The measurement of the assay background zone is an important factor during test interpretation as the reflectance is compared to that of the control and test zones. A background area that is white to light pink indicates the device has performed correctly. The instrument analyzes the reflectance data to provide the proper interpretation.

# 5. DEVICE COMPARISON

The BD Veritor™ System Flu $\mathsf { A } +$ B assay is substantially equivalent to the current legally marketed device, BD Veritor™ System Flu $\mathsf { A } + \mathsf { B }$ assay. Modifications made to the BD Veritor™ System Flu $\mathsf { A } +$ B assay product insert did not change the intended use of the device or the fundamental scientific technology.

The BD Veritor™ System Flu $\mathsf { A } +$ B assay product insert differs from the current legally marketed BD Veritor™ System Flu $\mathsf { A } +$ B assay product insert in the following way:

The product inserts includes an update to include information on Strain Reactivity to 14 additional strains of flu virus.

# 6. DESIGN CONTROL SUMMARY

Our Risk Assessment process is based on a BD Product Risk Management procedure which meets the requirement for risk management as set forth in ISO 14971:2007 and EN ISO 14971:2012. Using this procedure, the following are estimated:

the Hazard, the Adverse Effect (Harm to Patient), the Potential Causes of the Hazard, The probability of Severity and The probability of Occurrence are estimated.

Based on a resulting calculated Risk Index, Risk Control Measures are identified, required verification and validation activities are determined, and verification of the effectiveness of risk control measures is determined.

The tables below are taken from the procedure and provide guidelines to determine the probability of severity and occurrence. Additionally, a risk chart is provided below which depicts the areas of risk.

Risk regions include:

Insignificant (GR) – individual risks in the green region are deemed negligible in comparison with other risks and in relation to the benefit of using the product. Even if the risk falls into this region, the risk must be reduced as far as possible. For risks falling into this region , the medical benefit are considered to outweigh the individual residual risk since the combination of the occurrence and severity is considered low. These risks do not require individual risk benefit analysis. Because risk of harm in this region are deemed negligible, risk control measures implemented in this region, will not require documented verification of risk control measure effectiveness.

Investigate (YE) – individual risks in the yellow region are not negligible in comparison with other risks, therefore further risk reduction must be investigated. This category requires evaluation for risk reduction and once all possible risk control measures have been implemented, the residual risk is not reduced to insignificant (GR) is not possible, the individual item in this region require a documented risk/benefit analysis to document acceptance of the residual risk (See Attachment 3 for a Risk Benefit Analysis model.

Unacceptable/Intolerable (RE) - individual risks in the red region are unacceptable. This region requires the implementation of risk control measures to reduce the risk. In general, BDDS products should not have items with residual risks falling into this region. However, in an exceptional and rare circumstance, these items may be

documented in the risk/benefit analysis with approval by Medical Affairs at a director level or higher.

The risk assessment identified the need to confirm the Veritor system’s reactivity to new strains forecast for 2015/2016 Influenza Season, as well as other strains not previously tested available through CDC and WHO.

# RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS:

The results of the analysis indicated an initial possible combination of severity and occurrence that fell into S-3/P-3 category. To implement the indicated investigation, Protocol SDSP15001 was developed and approved based on previously accepted FDA submissions regarding strain reactivity. The design of the study is below and is replicated from a previous Special 510(k) submission. Acceptability criteria was the ability of the BD Veritor test to detect these additional Flu strains. Veritor was successful in detecting all strains tested. The data to be included in the insert are the actual values obtained during this testing. The results of the strain testing reduced the probability of occurrence from P-3 to P-1 and reduced the risk to the “negligible” category.

Finally, after review and clearance of this submission by FDA, a change control will be initiated to document this activity in the design history file and to route the new PI for approval.

Modifications to the product insert will be implemented in accordance to BD Change Control Procedure RDQP0401.

# 7. SUMMARY OF STUDIES

Study acceptance criteria were that the Veritor Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ assay system needed to give a positive instrumented read with samples of subject flu viruses in order to support this claim in a revised Package Insert. Subject Flu strains were chosen based on strains forecasted for the 2015/2016 Flu season, additional influenza strains available from CDC and WHO and also in response to customer requests. The testing protocol was the same as has been used in previous submissions to FDA regarding strain reactivity and is detailed in BD protocol Document SDSP15001. This study was conducted under the direction of Richard Anderson Ph.D. at the R/D laboratories in San Diego, CA. Viral material in allantoic fluid from chicken eggs was used in this study.

# Viruses tested

Twelve virus strains were provided by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Surveillance, Epidemiology and Control of Influenza and the US Centres for Disease Control.The two strains provided by National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (UK) used in this testing, A/Switzerland//9715293/2013 and B/Phuket/3073/2013, were received as lyophilized preparations and were subsequently reconstituted, amplified in culture and titred following procedures outlined in the WHO Manual on Animal Influenza Diagnosis and Surveillance (2002) before supplying this material for reactivity testing in the Veritor system.

Materials and procedures for this step are as follows:

MDCK cells:

TPCK-trypsin $( 2 ~ \mathrm { m g / m l } )$ :   
Complete MEM medium for MDCK cells:   
Penicillin ( $1 0 . 0 0 0 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m l } ) +$ Streptomycin ( $1 0 , 0 0 0 \ \mu { \sf g } / \mathsf { m l } )$   
Fetal Bovine Serum   
DMSO

ATCC, Cat# CCL-34   
Sigma, Cat #T1426-50MG   
ATCC, Cat # 30-2003   
Invitrogen, Cat # 15140-122   
Sigma Cat. # 30-2020   
Sigma Cat #D2438

1. Prepare TPCK-trypsin stocks:

a. Dissolve 20 mg TPCK-trypsin in 10 mL ${ \mathsf { d H } } _ { 2 } { \mathsf { O } }$ . Filter through $0 . 2 \mu \mathsf { L }$ membrane. Store in aliquots at $\mathsf { - } 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$

2. Prepare Complete MEM medium (CMM):

a. $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ MEM $+ 5 . 5$ mL Penicillin $\cdot 1 0 . 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L } ) /$ Streptomycin (10,000 $\mu \rho / \mathsf { m L } )$

3. Prepare cell growth medium (CGM) from CMM above: 500mL CMM $^ +$ 50mL FBS

4. Prepare compete virus growth medium $( { \mathsf { V G M } } ) : 0 . 5 { \mathsf { m L } }$ of TPCK-trypsin to CMM.

5. Freeze Medium: Add $5 \%$ DMSO to cell growth medium, freeze overnight at minus $8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ in liquid Nitrogen.

MDCK cells are routinely maintained in T-75 flasks in Cell Growth Media (CGM) supplemented with $10 \%$ (v/v) FBS and Penicillin/Streptomycin. One day before virus infection, MDCK cells were seeded into T-25 and T-75 flasks at $50 \%$

confluency resulting in $9 0 - 1 0 0 \%$ confluency at the time of infection. Reconstituted virus was incubated with CGM and VGM at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ , in a $5 \%$ $\mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ incubator for 1 hour. The flasks containing MDCK cells were washed with VGM and $1 \ : \mathsf { m l }$ of the incubated virus was added to a T-25 flask and the remaining to a T-75 flask, and then incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ , $5 \%$ $\mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ incubator for 2 hours. These flasks were washed twice with VGM, and then $3 \mathsf { m L }$ of VGM was added to the T-25 flask, $1 0 ~ \mathsf { m L }$ of VGM was added to the T-75 flask. The infected cells were incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ , in a $5 \%$ $\mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ incubator for 2-5 days. The flasks were examined under a microscope for signs of infection. When more than $80 \%$ cells were infected, the supernatants were aliquoted into $1 \mathsf { m L }$ tubes and kept in liquid nitrogen. These preparations were assigned a lot number based on date.

Viral titer was measured using a 96 well plate with MDCK host cells inoculated with 10 fold serial dilutions of virus. After 3-4 days at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ in a $\mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ incubator, the titration plate was examined for Viral Cytopathic effects and ${ \mathsf { T C l D } } _ { 5 0 }$ is calculated by the Reed-Muench formula
