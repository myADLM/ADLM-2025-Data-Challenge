The BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B is a differentiated test, such that influenza A viral antigens can be distinguished from influenza B viral antigens from a single processed sample using a single device. The test is to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza A and B viral infections. A negative test is presumptive and it is recommended that these results be confirmed by viral culture or an FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay. Outside the U.S. a negative test is presumptive and it is recommended that these results be confirmed by viral culture or a molecular assay cleared for diagnostic use in the country of use. FDA has not cleared this device outside the U.S. Negative test results do not preclude influenza viral infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. The test is not intended to detect influenza C antigens. Performance characteristics for influenza A and B nasopharyngeal (NP) washes/aspirates were established during January through March of 2011 when influenza viruses A/2009 H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria lineage, and B/Yamagata lineage were the predominant influenza viruses in circulation according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the CDC entitled &quot;Update: Influenza Activity-United States, 2010-2011 Season, and Composition of the 2011-2012 Influenza Vaccine.&quot; Performance characteristics may vary against other emerging influenza viruses.

# Differences

The package insert has been updated to include detection of the additional influenza A and B strains in the analytical reactivity information section and minimal detected concentration information has been listed for these additional viruses in the reactivity table.

The following limitation statement in the package insert has been moved from the “Analytical Sensitivity (Limit of Detection)” section to the “Strain Reactivity with Influenza A and B Viruses” section:

“Although this test has been shown to detect novel avian influenza A (H7N9) and H3N2v cultured viruses the performance characteristics of this device with clinical specimens that are positive for novel avian influenza A (H7N9) and H3N2v influenza viruses has not been established. The BD Veritor™ System Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ assay can distinguish between influenza A and B viruses, but it cannot differentiate influenza A subtypes.”

# 6. Design Control Activities Summary, which includes:

a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis

BD’s Risk Assessment process is based on a BD Product Risk Management procedure which meets the requirement for risk management as set forth in ISO 14971:2007 and EN ISO 14971:2012. Using this procedure, the following are estimated:

the Hazard, the Adverse Effect(Harm to Patient),   
the Potential Causes of the Hazard, The probability of Severity and the probability of occurrence are estimated.

Based on a resulting calculated Risk Index\*, Risk Control Measures are identified, required verification and validation activities are determined, and verification of the effectiveness of risk control measures is determined.

\*Risk Index:

Insignificant (GR) – individual risks in the green region are deemed negligible in comparison with other risks and in relation to the benefit of using the product. Even if the risk falls into this region, the risk must be reduced as far as possible. For risks falling into this region, the medical benefit is considered to outweigh the individual residual risk since the combination of the occurrence and severity is considered low. These risks do not require individual risk benefit analysis. Because risk of harm in this region are deemed negligible, risk control measures implemented in this region, will not require documented verification of risk control measure effectiveness.

Investigate (YE) –individual risks in the yellow region are not negligible in comparison with other risks, therefore further risk reduction must be investigated. This category requires evaluation for risk reduction and once all possible risk control measures have been implemented, the residual risk is not reduced to insignificant (GR) is not possible, the individual item in this region require a documented risk/benefit analysis to document acceptance of the residual risk (See Attachment 3 for a Risk Benefit Analysis model.

Unacceptable/Intolerable (RE) – individual risks in the red region are unacceptable. This region requires the implementation of risk control measures to reduce the risk. In general, BDDS products should not have items with residual risks falling into this region. However, in an exceptional and rare circumstance, these items may be documented in the risk/benefit analysis with approval by Medical Affairs at a director level or higher.

# RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS:

The results of the analysis indicated an initial possible combination of severity and occurrence that fell into S-3/P-3 category (i.e., Risk Index of “Investigate”):

b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied

To implement the indicated investigation, Protocol SDSP15001 was developed and approved based on previously accepted FDA submissions regarding strain reactivity. Specific influenza strains selection for this reactivity study was based on new circulating strains for 2015/2016 Influenza Season, as well as availability of other strains through CDC and WHO. Acceptability criteria were the ability of the BD Veritor™ System Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ assay (Laboratory Kit) to detect these additional influenza strains.

Analytical Reactivity Testing was conducted as described in section 3, Device Modifications.

BD Veritor™ System Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ assay (Laboratory Kit) was successful in detecting all strains tested. The acceptance criteria were fully met. The package insert will be updated to include the data obtained during this strain reactivity testing. The results of the strain reactivity testing reduced the probability of occurrence from P-3 to P-1 and reduced the Risk Index to the “Insignificant” category:

c) Declaration of Conformity with Design Controls

A “Declaration of Conformity with Design Controls” statement was submitted for the validation activities and manufacturing facility by the Director of Regulatory Fairs and Quality Systems. The statement indicates that;

1) To the best of knowledge of the Director of Regulatory Fairs and Quality Systems, the verification activities, as required by the risk analysis, for the modification were performed by the designated individual(s) and the results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance criteria were met.   
2) The manufacturing facility, BD Rapid Diagnostics Co Ltd, is in conformance with the design control requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820. 30 and the records are available for review.

7. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary, and the Indications for Use Enclosure.

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular modification and the analytical strain reactivity data demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
