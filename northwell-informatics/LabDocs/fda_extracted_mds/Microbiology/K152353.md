# Description:

The SeraQuest® HSV Type 2 Specific IgG test is a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) , which is performed in microwells, at room temperature, and in three thirty minute incubations The test detects IgG antibodies which are directed against HSV 2 type-specific antigens in human serum. The Calibrator in the SeraQues $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ HSV Type 2 Specific IgG test set has been assigned Index values based on an in-house standard. Test results are reported as Index values. The following table shows the interpretation of results:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Index</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Result</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Interpretation</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>≤ 0.9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Negative</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>No HSV-2 IgG antibodies detected. Patient is presumed not tohave had a previous HSV-2 infection.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9&lt;X&lt;1.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Equivocal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Obtain an additional sample for re-testing</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>≥ 1.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Positive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>IgG antibody to HSV-2 detected.</td></tr></table>

Notes:

1. A single positive result only indicates previous immunologic exposure; the level of antibody response may not be used to determine active infection or disease stage.

2. When equivocal results are obtained, another specimen should be obtained ten to fourteen days later, and tested in parallel with the initial specimen. If the second specimen is also

Quest International, Inc., 8127 NW ${ 2 9 } ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ Street, Miami, FL 33122 equivocal, the patient is negative for primary or recent infection, and equivocal for antibody status. If the second sample is positive, the patient can be considered to have previous experience with HSV-2 infection.

3. Values obtained with different manufacturer's assay methods may not be used interchangeably. The magnitude of the reported IgG index value cannot be correlated to an endpoint titer. The magnitude of results above the cut-off is not an indicator of total antibody present.

# Principle:

Diluted patient samples are incubated in antigen-coated wells. HSV Type 2 antibodies, if present in the patient sample, are immobilized in the wells by binding to the antigen. Residual sample is eliminated by washing and draining, and conjugate (enzyme-labeled antibodies to human IgG) is added and incubated. If IgG antibodies to HSV-2 are present, the conjugate will be immobilized in the wells. Residual conjugate is eliminated by washing and draining, and the substrate is added and incubated. In the presence of the conjugate, the substrate is converted to a yellow end-product which is read photometrically.

# Intended Use:

Intended Use: For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only. The SeraQuest HSV Type 2 Specific IgG assay is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) intended for the qualitative detection of human IgG antibodies to type 2 herpes simplex virus (HSV) in human serum. The test is indicated for sexually active individuals and expectant mothers as an aid in the presumptive diagnosis of HSV-2 infection. The predictive value of a positive or negative result depends on the prevalence of HSV-2 infection in the population and the pre-test likelihood of HSV-2 infection.

The test is not FDA cleared for screening blood or plasma donors. The performance of this assay has not been established for immunocompromised patients, pediatric patients or matrices other than human serum.

# Predicate Device:

A commercial, legally marketed HSV 1 and 2 Immunoblot IgG test.

# 2. Specificity Testing

A cross-reactivity study was performed to determine if samples from various disease states and other potentially cross-reacting agents interfere with the test results. The samples were determined to be positive for IgG antibodies directed against taxonomically related viruses and other related pathogens by other legally marketed devices. Human Papilloma Virus, Chlamydia trachomitis, and Neisseria gonorrhea samples were from individual patients with confirmed sexually transmitted infections. The samples were also tested for Type 2 HSV antibody by another legally marketed device. Only those samples that tested negative for Type 2 HSV antibody by the legally marketed device were included in the study. The results of this study are shown below in Table 3.

# 3. Interference Testing

The effects of icterus, hemolysis, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hyperproteinemia on the test results were examined. Samples that were negative, weakly positive and moderately positive for antibodies to Type 2 HSV were tested with and without the addition of elevated levels of the following potential interfering substances: hemoglobin $1 8 9 / \mathrm { d L }$ , glucose 800 mg dL, cholesterol $2 , 7 2 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , globulin $2 8 ~ 9 / \mathrm { d L }$ , unconjugated bilirubin $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , conjugated bilirubin $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , human albumin $1 2 { \mathfrak { g } } / { \mathfrak { d } } \mathsf { L }$ and ascorbic acid 3mg/dL.

No significant interference was observed in the presence of abnormally elevated levels of the potentially interfering substances tested, however the use of grossly hemolyzed, icteric or lipemic samples, as well as samples containing particulate matter or exhibiting obvious microbial contamination is not recommended and they should not be tested.

# 4. Comparison With The Predicate Device
