# Differences:

1) The package insert for the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct Assay has been updated to include detection of 37 influenza A strains, 9 influenza B strains, and 7 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) strains to the Analytical Reactivity/Cross-Reactivity Section.

2) The following wording was changed in the Warnings and Precautions Section of the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct Assay package insert: “Contamination of patient specimens or reagents can produce erroneous results. Use aseptic techniques.”

The new language is as follows:   
“Treat all specimens and discs as capable of transmitting infectious agents. Contamination   
of patient specimens or reagents can produce erroneous results. Use good laboratory   
practices and control workflow.7,8”

3) The words “Rx Only” were moved from the Limitations Section to the front page of the of the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct Assay package insert.

4) The word “reaction mix” was changed to “Reaction Mix” throughout the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct Assay package insert.

# 6. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:

1) Cross-reactivity testing was conducted as described in Section 3, Device Modifications.

# 2) Risk Analysis

The method used for the Risk Analysis for the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct Assay was the Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA). This method is consistent with 21 CFR 820.30. The following table summarizes the risk analysis:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Risk Type</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Failure Mode</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>PotentialHazard(Harm)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>S) hY</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>PotentialCause ofFailure</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Gee GJo GO</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>RAM GJr AAM</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Risk ControlMeasures (RCM)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Verification ofRCMImplementation</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>WOP JA AAO</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>RAA Jar AAM</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ProductDesign</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Additionalviruses withsequencevarriationscould beencounteredin the futurethat MOL2650is unable todetect.</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>FalseNegative</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Geneticmismatchesto theprimers andscorpions.</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>III</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.A validation wasperformed andincluded additionalstrains. 53additional strainswere detected atclinically relevantlevels.2.PI lists additionalstrains in theAnalyticalReactivity / CrossReactivity section.</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.PROT.215.00090VALR.215.000902.PI.MOL2650.IVD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>IV</td></tr></table>

The risk of a false negative result was identified as a potential hazard that could occur if target viral sequences contained genetic mismatches with the primers and scorpion probes. This risk was addressed by conducting cross-reactivity testing on an additional 53 viral strains with the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct Assay and through updating the package insert (PI).

3) Declaration of Conformity to Design Controls

A “Declaration of Conformity” statement was submitted for the Focus Diagnostics manufacturing facility. It was signed by the Senior Project Manager, an R&D Scientist, and the R&D Technical Director. The statements indicate that:

3a) “All development activities for the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV REF MOL2650 expanded claims for the addition of the following analytical reactivity strains have been completed, including risk analysis, verification and validation. Activities were performed by designated individuals and the results demonstrated that the pre-determined acceptance criteria were met.” Viral strains tested were listed in the Declaration of Conformity (see Section 3 for a complete list).

3b) “The Focus Diagnostics manufacturing facility is in conformance with the Design Control Procedure requirement as specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and the records are available for review.”

In conclusion, based on the Risk Analysis and the results of the analytical cross-reactivity testing, the modified labeling is truthful and accurate. The changes do not affect the performance of the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct Assay and, therefore, it is substantially equivalent to the currently cleared test.

# 7. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary, and the Indications for Use Enclosure.

The labeling for the modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular modification and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified device demonstrates that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. On this basis, I recommend that the device is determined to be substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
