# I. Device Description:

BD BBL Sensi-Disc Ceftazidime avibactam $( 3 0 / 2 0 \mu \mathrm { g } )$ is prepared by impregnating high quality paper with accurately determined amounts of Ceftazidime avibactam $( 3 0 / 2 0 \mu \mathrm { g } )$ supplied by the drug manufacturer. Each Ceftazidime avibactam $( 3 0 / 2 0 \mu \mathrm { g } )$ disc is clearly marked on both sides with the agent and drug content. Ceftazidime avibactam $( 3 0 / 2 0 \mu \mathrm { g } )$ cartridges each contain 50 impregnated discs that are packed as a single cartridge in a single box. Ceftazidime avibactam $( 3 0 / 2 0 \mu \mathrm { g } )$ discs are used for in vitro susceptibility evaluations by the agar diffusion test method.

Agar diffusion susceptibility methods employing dried filter paper disks impregnated with specific concentrations of antimicrobial agents were developed in the 1940s. In order to eliminate or minimize variability in the testing, Bauer et al. developed a standardized procedure in which Mueller Hinton Agar was selected as the test medium. Standardized procedures were followed for testing Ceftazidime avibactam. Those are based on standard methods published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) and are referenced in the FDA pharmaceutical drug package insert.

CLSI M100-S25. Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing; Approved Standard.

# L. Test Principle:

Discs containing a wide variety of antimicrobial agents are applied to the surface of Mueller Hinton Agar plates inoculated with pure cultures of clinical isolates. Following incubation, the plates are examined and the zones of inhibition surrounding the disks are measured and compared with established zone size ranges for individual antimicrobial agents in order to determine the agent(s) most suitable for use in antimicrobial therapy. The categorical

interpretation [susceptible(S), intermediate (I), or resistant (R)] for the organism being tested with the antimicrobial agent is made by comparing zone diameters to those found in the respective organism tables of the FDA drug insert and/or CLSI/NCCLS Document M2 (“Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Disk Susceptibility Tests”) and of CLSI/NCCLS Document M100 (“Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing”).
