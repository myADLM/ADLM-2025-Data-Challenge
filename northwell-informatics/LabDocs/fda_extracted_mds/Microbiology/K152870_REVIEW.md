# 5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:

a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis.

The Risk Analysis method used was based on a BD Product Risk Management procedure which meets the requirement for risk management as set forth in ISO14971:2007 and EN ISO 14971:2012.

b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.

The results of the analysis indicated an initial possible combination of severity and occurrence that fell into S-3/P-3 category. To implement the indicated investigation, a protocol was developed and approved based on previously accepted FDA submissions regarding strain reactivity. Acceptability criteria were defined as the ability of the BD Veritor test to detect the additional Flu strains. The results of the strain testing reduced the probability of occurrence from P-3 to P-1 and reduced the risk to the “negligible” category.

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.
