# 5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:

a. Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis

The Risk Assessment process used was based on a BD Product Risk Management procedure which, according to the sponsor, meets the requirement for risk management as set forth in ISO 14971:2007 and EN ISO 14971:2012.

Using this procedure, the following were estimated and the results are in the table below under 5b:

· The Hazard, · The Adverse Effect (Harm to Patient), · The Potential Causes of the Hazard, · The probability of Hazard Severity and The probability of Occurrence

b. Based on the resulting calculated Risk Index, Risk Control Measures were identified, required verification and validation activities were determined, and effectiveness of risk control measures were verified.

The risk assessment identified the need to confirm the BD Veritor™ System’s reactivity to new strains forecast for 2015/2016 Influenza Season.

The results of the analysis indicated an initial possible combination of severity and occurrence that fell into S-3/P-3 category. To implement the indicated investigation, Protocol SDSP15004 was developed and approved based on previously accepted FDA submissions regarding strain reactivity. The design of the study is replicated from a previous Special 510(k) submission. The acceptability criterion was the ability of the BD VeritorTM test to detect the additional Flu strains. The BD VeritorTM System Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ assay successfully detected all strains tested. The data to be included in the insert are the actual values obtained during this testing. The results of the strain testing reduced the probability of occurrence from P-3 to P-1 and reduced the risk to the “negligible” category.

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device
