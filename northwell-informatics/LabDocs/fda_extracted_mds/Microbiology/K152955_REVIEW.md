# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The Great Basin Shiga Toxin Direct Test performed on the Portrait Analyzer is an automated, in vitro diagnostic assay for the qualitative detection of Shiga Toxin 1 $( s t x I ) /$ Shiga Toxin 2 $( s t x 2 )$ genes and specific identification of a conserved genetic region of the $E .$ . coli O157 serogroup. Shiga Toxin genes are found in Shiga Toxin producing strains of $E$ . coli and Shigella dysenteriae.

The $E$ . coli O157 test result is reported only if a Shiga Toxin gene is also detected. The test is performed directly from Cary Blair or C&S Medium preserved stool specimens from symptomatic patients with suspected acute gastroenteritis, enteritis, or colitis in hospital laboratories. The assay is intended for use in conjunction with clinical presentation as an aid in the diagnosis of STEC infections. Positive results do not rule out co-infection with other organisms, and may not be the definitive cause of patient illness.

The results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decisions. Shiga Toxin Direct Test negative results in the setting of clinical illness compatible with gastroenteritis may be due to infection by pathogens that are not detected by this test or non-infectious causes such as ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, or Crohn’s disease.

# L. Test Principle:

The Portrait System utilizes automated hot start PCR amplification technology to amplify specific nucleic acid sequences that are then detected using hybridization probes immobilized on a modified silicon chip surface.

Target genomic DNA is extracted from preserved stool specimens alongside sample processing control cells (SPC) and diluted to reduce potential inhibitors of the PCR reaction. During the PCR process, double-stranded DNA is separated and target nucleic acid sequences are amplified by thermal cycling. Biotin-labeled primers direct amplification of specific nucleic acid sequences within a conserved region of the stx1, stx2, and O157 antigen-specific genes for identification of Shiga toxin producing E. coli.

Following the PCR process, biotin-labeled, amplified target DNA sequences are hybridized to an array of probes immobilized on the silicon chip surface, then incubated with anti-biotin antibody conjugated to the horseradish peroxidase enzyme (HRP). These probes are specific for Shiga toxin 1 $( s t x I )$ , Shiga toxin 2 $( s t x 2 )$ , an O157 antigen marker gene, and the SPC. The unbound conjugate is removed by washing and tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) is added to produce a colored precipitate at the location of the probe/target sequence complex.

The resulting signal is detected by the automated Portrait Optical Reader within the Portrait Analyzer. While the Shiga Toxin Direct Test is designed to detect and distinguish between $s t x l$ and ${ s t x 2 }$ toxin types, the assay does not report results to the individual toxin level.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance:

a. Reproducibility:

Reproducibility testing of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test was conducted using a panel of four positive samples and one negative sample. The positive panel members consisted of two Shiga toxin-producing $E .$ . coli (STEC) strains: ATCC BAA- 2192 (O145:NM) and ATCC strain 43895 (O157:H7), each at a moderate positive concentration $( \sim 3 \mathrm { X }$ LoD) and a low positive concentration $( \mathrm { { \sim } } 1 . 5 \mathrm { { X } }$ LoD). The positive samples were contrived by spiking enriched broth cultures of known concentration into negative clinical stool matrix consisting of clinical Shiga toxin negative stool preserved in ParaPak $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ C&S media. The negative samples consisted of clinical negative stool matrix.

The reproducibility studies were performed at three external clinical sites using randomized, blind-coded panels and two different Shiga Toxin Direct Test cartridge lots. The studies were performed over the course of five (5), nonconsecutive days. For each day of testing, two (2) panel runs were performed with three (3) replicates of each sample per run on each day. A minimum of two (2) operators performed the testing at each site.

For moderate and low positive ATCC BAA-2192 samples, $\%$ agreement $=$ "STEC Positive; O157 Negative" calls per total sample runs. For moderate and low positive ATCC 43895 samples, $\%$ agreement $=$ "STEC Positive; O157 Positive" calls per total sample runs. For clinical negative samples, $\%$ agreement $=$ "STEC Negative; O157 Not Tested" calls per total samples runs.

The Shiga Toxin Direct Test results agreed with the expected results $100 \%$ across all three sites, with the exception of a single Low Positive replicate for ATCC BAA2192 that produced a ‘STEC POSITIVE/Serotype O157 POSITIVE’ test result instead of the expected result of ‘STEC POSITIVE/Serotype O157 NEGATIVE’.

The invalid and incomplete test rates for the reproducibility study were $1 . 1 \%$ (5 invalid runs/ 458 total runs) and $0 . 7 \%$ (3 test incomplete runs/ 458 total runs), respectively. In all eight (8) instances, the sample was re-tested on a new cartridge according to the package insert and each resolved to the expected result. The reproducibility study results were acceptable. The results of the reproducibility studies are summarized in Table 1.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

External controls:

External positive and negative controls are intended to monitor for correct procedural technique and reagent integrity. External controls are not provided by Great Basin and are not included in the package insert.

1. Commercially available ATCC Shiga toxin producing $E .$ . coli strains, for example ATCC 700376 (E. coli O157:NM, stx1+) and ATCC 51434 (E. coli O91:H21, stx $^ { 2 + }$ ), which have been diluted into Cary Blair or C&S media, are recommended for use as positive controls.

2. An aliquot of Cary Blair or C&S media may be used as a Negative Control. Alternatively, a known negative stool sample preserved in Cary Blair or C&S media may be used.

The external Positive Control is intended to monitor for substantial reagent failure. The external Negative Control is intended to confirm non-reactivity. An ‘INVALID’ result for any controls invalidates the Test result. Good laboratory practice recommends the use of control samples. The Shiga Toxin Direct Test should not be used in patient testing if the appropriate controls do not produce the expected results. If the external controls do not produce the expected results, the test should be repeated with a new Test Cartridge.

Daily Quality Control (QC) testing was conducted at each site during prospective and frozen retrospective clinical testing. The daily QC panel consisted of one negative and two positive samples to control for all assay outcomes. A total of 164 negative controls and 328 positive controls were tested across six test sites producing valid expected initial results for 163 $( 9 9 . 4 \% )$ and 317 $( 9 6 . 6 \% )$ negative controls and positive controls, respectively. One negative control and two positive controls produced initial ‘Test Incomplete’ results $( 0 . 6 \% )$ . Seven positive controls produced initial ‘Invalid’ results $( 2 . 1 \% )$ , and two positive controls produced valid but incorrect results $( 0 . 6 \% )$ . All initially invalid and unexpected results $( 1 0 0 \% )$ resolved to the expected result upon re-test.

Specimen Processing Control (SPC):

The SPC controls for all analytical steps in the procedure, including: DNA extraction from organisms present in the stool specimen, PCR amplification of target DNA sequences, hybridization, and detection on the chip surface. The SPC contains $B$ . subtilis cells in the form of a lyophilized cake that is incorporated directly into each Test Cartridge to verify adequate processing of each clinical stool specimen sample. If enteric microorganisms (such as bacteria including but not limited to $E .$ . coli) are found in the stool specimen, the SPC verifies that proper cell lysis has occurred and verifies that specimen processing is adequate. Additionally, SPC detects inhibition of

PCR reactions, ensuring the PCR reaction conditions are appropriate and that the amplification reagents are functional. The SPC signal should be positive in a sample that is negative for Shiga Toxin Direct Test analyte(s), and can be either negative or positive in a sample containing analyte(s).

Specimen stability:

The recommended storage time and temperature conditions for transport media preserved stool specimens prior to testing via the Shiga Toxin Direct Test include:

• Refrigerated storage $( 2 ^ { \circ } - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for up to 120 hours (5 days). • Room temperature $( 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ storage for up to 4 hours. The combination of up to 4 hours storage at room temperature followed by refrigerated storage for up to 120 hours.

To assess the stability of the Shiga toxin and serotype O157 nucleic acid targets of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test under the recommended storage conditions, a specimen stability study was performed to evaluate the recommended time and temperature storage conditions. The study tested two non-O157 STEC strains (ATCC BAA-2191 and ATCC 51434) and one O157 STEC strain (ATCC 43889). Each sample was contrived from freshly cultured STEC cells spiked at 2X LoD into negative stool matrix and stored under the recommended storage conditions. The LoD was approximated for the O157 STEC strain (ATCC 43889). A second O157 STEC strain (ATCC 43890) was tested but was not included in the final analysis when baseline $\left( \mathrm { T } _ { 0 } \right)$ testing results of $80 \%$ positivity indicated that the strain was spiked at concentrations below 2X LoD. At five pre-defined testing time points, an aliquot of each sample was removed and evaluated on the Shiga Toxin Direct Test. The results of the specimen stability study support the recommended storage time and temperature conditions for transport media preserved stool specimens. The results of Specimen Stability Testing are summarized in Table 2.

Fresh versus Frozen:

A Fresh vs. Frozen Study was performed to support the use of frozen, transport media preserved stool specimens in the Shiga Toxin Direct Test for the Frozen Retrospective and Reproducibility Studies, as well as for follow-up testing of prospective samples.

The Fresh vs. Frozen Study tested the performance of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test on contrived positive samples that were subjected to two freeze/thaw cycles. The contrived positive samples were prepared using fresh (i.e. never frozen) enriched broth cultures. The panel for the Fresh vs. Frozen Study was comprised of six STEC strains: ATCC BAA-2191 $( s t x I + / \mathrm { O } 1 5 7 -$ ), ATCC 51434 $( s t x 2 + / \mathrm { O } 1 5 7 .$ ), ATCC BAA2192 $( s t x I + / s t x 2 + / \mathrm { O } 1 5 7 \cdot$ ), ATCC 43890 $( s t x I + / \mathrm { O } 1 5 7 + )$ , ATCC 43889 $( s t x 2 \substack { + } / \mathrm { O } 1 5 7 \substack { + } )$ , and ATCC 43895 $( s t x I + / s t x 2 + / \mathrm { O } 1 5 7 + )$ . Each strain was tested in replicate at four concentrations: $\leq 0 . 5 \mathrm { X }$ LoD, 1X LoD, 3X LoD, and 10X LoD. The LoD was approximated for strains ATCC 43890 and ATCC 43889

The panel was initially tested on the Shiga Toxin Direct Test within 30 minutes of construction to establish the ‘fresh’ activity prior to freezing $\left( \mathrm { T } _ { 0 } \right)$ . The entire panel was then placed at $\mathrm { \leq } \mathrm { - } 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 1 week at which time it was thawed and re-tested $( \mathrm { T } _ { 1 } )$ . The entire panel was returned to $\mathrm { \leq } \mathrm { - } 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for a second freezing cycle for an additional one week at which time the samples were tested for a second, and final, thaw $\left( \mathrm { T } _ { 2 } \right)$ .

The study results support the testing of stool specimens preserved in C&S media for up to two freeze/thaw cycles. The results of the Fresh vs. Frozen study are summarized in Table 3.

# Media Equivalency:

A Media Equivalency Study was conducted to demonstrate equivalent Shiga Toxin Direct Test performance in six (6) widely used stool preservation media types: Thermo Scientific™ Remel™ Cary Blair Transport Medium, Meridian™ Para-Pak® Enteric Plus Transport System, Thermo Scientific™ Protocol™ Cary Blair Media, Thermo Scientific™ Protocol™ Culture & Sensitivity (C&S) Medium, Meridian™ Para-Pak® $10 \%$ Formalin Stool Transport Vial, Meridian™ Para-Pak® Zn PVA Stool Transport Vial.

Analytical Sensitivity (LoD) was established for several strains in Meridian™ Para$\mathrm { P a k } ^ { \mathbb { B } }$ C&S which served as the reference medium. The media equivalency study

evaluated three (3) of the previously characterized STEC strains at concentrations near LoD (2X LoD), above LoD (5X LoD) and below LoD (0.5X LoD) in different media. To generate the unique stool matrices for each media type, raw clinical stool specimens that previously tested negative for Shiga Toxin were preserved in each preservation medium per the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting six stool matrices were evaluated directly as clinical negative samples and as contrived positives.

For the Thermo Scientific™ Remel™ Cary Blair Transport Medium, Meridian™ Para- $\mathbf { \cdot P a k } ^ { \mathbb { ( B ) } }$ Enteric Plus Transport System, Thermo Scientific™ Protocol™ Cary Blair Media, and Thermo Scientific™ Protocol™ Culture & Sensitivity (C&S) Medium, results indicated that the media were equivalent to each other and equivalent to the reference medium (Meridian™ Para-Pak® C&S) for test performance. At 5X LoD, for all strains tested, there was $100 \%$ agreement with the expected results in all four (4) media types. Likewise, at 2X LoD there was $2 9 5 \%$ agreement with the expected results for all strains tested across all four (4) media types. Also as expected, the percent agreement for strains below LoD (0.5X LoD) varied from $50 \%$ to $100 \%$ across these four (4) media types.

The Meridian™ Para- $\mathrm { P a k } ^ { \mathcal { \textregistered } } 1 0 \%$ Formalin Stool Transport Vial media did not produce the expected results for positive or negative samples. At concentrations of STEC strains where a positive Shiga Toxin Direct Test result was expected $\mathrm { i n } \geq 9 5 \%$ of replicates, all of the testing produced either ‘STEC Negative/Serotype O157 Not Tested’ $( 1 2 \% )$ or ‘Invalid’ $( 8 8 \% )$ results. In negative stool matrix formulated with this media, only $20 \%$ (2/10 replicates) of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test results resolved as the expected ‘STEC Negative/Serotype O157 Not Tested’ result, and the remaining $80 \%$ of negative stool replicates (8/10 replicates) produced ‘Invalid’ results. The overall invalid rate for initial testing (35 samples in total) was abnormally high at $8 5 . 7 \%$ , suggesting that $10 \%$ Formalin transport media inhibits the Shiga Toxin Direct Test. Due to the evident inhibition and hindered performance of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test, no further testing was conducted on this media type.

The Meridian™ Para- $\mathbf { \cdot P a k } ^ { \mathbb { ( B ) } }$ Zn PVA Stool Transport Vial media also produced aberrant results with the Shiga Toxin Direct Test. At approximately 2X-5X LoD when $2 9 5 \%$ of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test replicates are expected to be ‘STEC Positive/Serotype O157 Negative’, $100 \%$ of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test replicates produced ‘Invalid’ test results. Similarly, $100 \%$ of the negative stool matrix samples formulated with this medium produced ‘Invalid’ Shiga Toxin Direct Test results, indicating that this transport medium completely inhibits the Shiga Toxin Direct Test. No further testing was conducted on this media type.

A summary of all media types tested and their resultant compatibility with the Shiga Toxin Direct Test is provided in Table 4.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of detection (LoD) for four (4) Shiga toxin-producing $E$ . coli (STEC) strains was measured for the Shiga Toxin Direct Test. The LoD for each toxin gene, $s t x l$ and stx2, was assessed and measured independently by testing a non- $. 0 1 5 7 \ s t x I +$ Escherichia coli strain (ATCC BAA-2191) and a non-O157 $s t x 2 +$ Escherichia coli strain (ATCC 51434), respectively. In addition the LoD for a non-O157 Escherichia coli strain containing both toxin genes $( s t x I + / s t x 2 + / \mathrm { O } 1 5 7 \cdot$ ) was measured (ATCC BAA-2192). Finally, the LoD for an O157 Serotype Escherichia coli strain containing both toxin genes $( s t x I + / s t x 2 + / \mathrm { O } 1 5 7 + )$ was also measured (ATCC 43895). The LoD for each strain is listed in Table 5.

# Inclusivity/reactivity

The inclusivity/reactivity of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test was tested against 30 wellcharacterized Shiga toxin-producing $E .$ . coli (STEC) strains representing the serotypes of $E$ . coli that are most often associated with disease: serotypes O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, O145, and O157. The Shiga toxin gene $( s t x )$ which is identical in sequence to the STECstx1 gene is also commonly found in Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 strains. Therefore in addition to STEC strains, three (3) serotype 1

Shigella dysenteriae strains were tested.

Cultured organism concentrations were verified by colony counting, spiked into negative clinical stool matrix in Parapak $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ C&S media at approximately 2XLoD (1.0 $\mathrm { \Delta \times 1 0 ^ { 4 } C F U / m L }$ ), and tested in triplicate. The Shiga Toxin Direct Test correctly detected all 21 of the non-O157 Serotype STEC and three (3) Serotype 1 Shigella dysenteriae strains as ‘STEC POSITIVE/Serotype O157 Negative.’ All nine (9) O157 serotype STEC strains were identified as ‘STEC POSITIVE/ Serotype O157 POSITIVE’.

† Concentration of broth culture estimated from optical density due to lack of growth on plates for exact colony counting. ^ This Shigella dysenteriae strain contains the Shiga toxin gene $( s t x )$ which is identical in sequence to $s t x I$ ; therefore the Shiga Toxin Direct Test reports this strain as ‘STEC POSITIVE/ Serotype O157 Negative.’

# e. Analytical specificity:

Cross reactivity:

A study was conducted to assess the potential for cross-reactivity of non-target organisms found in stool specimens, including well-known enteric pathogens that present clinically with symptoms similar to STEC, such as diarrhea. In total 104 unique bacterial strains, three (3) yeast, three (3) parasites, seven (7) viruses, and human genomic DNA were evaluated for cross-reactivity. For some organisms that were classified as Biosafety level III or that could not be cultured via standard clinical microbiology techniques, genomic DNA was tested in lieu of whole organism. Each non-target organism or nucleic acid was tested in the background of negative clinical stool matrix consisting of clinical Shiga toxin negative stool preserved in ParaPak® C&S media (Table 7).

Due to the design of the Sample Processing Control (SPC) in the Shiga Toxin Direct Test, very high concentrations of non-STEC O157 $E .$ . coli can compete with amplification of the SPC. An SPC amplification failure in the absence of a Shiga toxin target signal will produce an invalid test result. Accordingly, two non-STEC O157:H7 E. coli strains (ATCC 43888 and ATCC 700728) produced invalid test results when tested at concentrations greater than or equal to $1 . 0 { \mathrm { x } } 1 0 ^ { 7 } { \mathrm { C F U / m L } }$ . When the test concentrations for these strains (ATCC 43888 and ATCC 700728) were lowered to approximately $1 . 0 { \mathrm { x } } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ prior to re-testing, the correct expected result of ‘STEC Negative/Serotype O157 Not Tested’ was produced. None of the other cultured organisms or genomic DNA that were tested interfered with the internal controls or demonstrated cross reactivity.

# Interference:

Twenty-six (26) endogenous and exogenous substances that are common stool contaminants or likely present in patients with diarrhea were evaluated for potential interference with the Shiga Toxin Direct Test (Table 8). Each substance was tested in the background of a contrived, low positive sample that was generated by spiking a Shiga toxin-producing $E .$ . coli strain (ATCC 43895) containing all three test analytes $( s t x I + , s t x 2 +$ , and serotype O157) into ParaPak® C&S preserved clinical negative stool matrix at 2X LoD $( \mathrm { \bar { 1 } x 1 0 ^ { 4 } C F U / m L } )$ ). Clinical negative stool matrix was also tested (i.e. negative stool specimen, non-STEC) to evaluate potential interference with assay controls in the absence of analyte.

None of the tested substances interfered with detection of either Shiga toxin or the O157 Serotype gene targets, and each test resulted in ‘STEC POSITIVE/Serotype O157 POSITIVE’ calls as expected. Additionally, none of the substances interfered with assays controls when negative stool was tested. During testing, two (2) runs yielded incomplete testing results, and a single ‘Invalid’ test was observed. In each instance the specimen was re-retested using a new Shiga Toxin Direct Test cartridge, and the testing resolved to the correct result.

# Microbial Interference:

As a follow up to cross reactivity studies, the Shiga Toxin Direct Test was further evaluated for interference from mixed microbial populations using a subset of 42 organisms and genomic DNA from the cross reactivity panel with a specific focus on common gastrointestinal pathogens encountered in stool that cause similar disease states to Shiga toxins. In total, 30 bacterial strains, two (2) yeast, four (4) parasites, five (5) viruses, and human genomic DNA were tested (Table 9). Potential interference from mixed infections was evaluated by testing two (2) STEC strains (ATCC 43895 and ATCC 43894) that represent all three target analytes $( s t x I + / s t x 2 + / \mathrm { O } 1 5 7 $ ) at $2 \mathrm { { X L o D } }$ in the background of high concentrations of the nonShiga toxin-producing enteric organisms. A minimum of three replicate Shiga Toxin Direct Tests were performed for each potentially interfering organism or nucleic acid.

All of the valid test runs produced the expected ‘STEC POSITIVE/Serotype O157 POSITIVE’ result, indicating that none of the tested organisms or nucleic acids interfered with the detection of Shiga Toxin Direct Test gene targets at 2X LoD.

# Carryover/Cross-Contamination:

A study was performed to assess the potential of carry-over or cross-contamination of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test by alternatively testing high positive contrived stool samples and clinical negative stool samples in direct succession for six (6) rounds on five (5) Portrait Analyzers. The high positive sample was formulated by spiking previously frozen and quantified enriched broth culture of STEC strain ATCC 43895 $( s t x I + / s t x 2 + / \mathrm { O } 1 5 7 $ ) into negative clinical stool matrix consisting of clinical Shiga toxin negative stool preserved in ParaPak® C&S media to obtain a final concentration of $1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ . In total, 60 Shiga Toxin Direct Test runs were performed: 30 high positive runs and 30 negative runs.

All of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test results agreed with the expected test results. Therefore, there was no evidence of carry-over or cross-contamination in any of the tests. During carry-over/cross-contamination assessment, two (2) tests gave ‘Test Incomplete’ results and a single ‘Invalid’ test results was observed. All three samples were re-tested on new cartridges and all resolved to the expected result.

# 3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity:

Performance characteristics of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test were determined in a multi-site clinical study. Specimens for the clinical study were collected prospectively (fresh) at five sites during a three-month period from June to September 2015. A combined total of 1,116 clinical stool samples were enrolled and evaluated. Of these, 1,082 clinical specimens met the inclusion criteria. Of these 1,082 specimens, 1047 used C&S preservation medium, 34 used Cary Blair preservation medium, and the preservation medium type was not specified for one specimen. Performance was evaluated by comparing the performance of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test to reference clinical microbiology protocols for the independent detection of Shiga toxin and the E. coli O157 serotype. Combined results from the multi-site investigational study are summarized in Tables 10 for Shiga toxin and the E. coli O157 serotype.

$\ddagger 0 1 5 7$ serogroup DNA sequence was detected in 2/2 false positive specimens by alternate, FDAcleared comparator NAAT.

Due to the low clinical prevalence of Shiga toxin-producing $E$ . coli (STEC) and the O157 serotype in the prospective clinical study, a frozen retrospective panel of 88 unique, archived clinical stool specimens was tested with the Shiga Toxin Direct Test at multiple sites. Of these 88 specimens, 44 used C&S preservation medium, 40 used Cary Blair preservation medium, and 4 used Enteric Transport medium. The frozen retrospective panel consisted of 55 STEC positive and 33 STEC negative clinical specimens. Twenty three (23) of the STEC positive retrospective specimens were

serotype O157 positive. The initial clinical characterization (i.e. presence of Shiga toxins and O-antigen serotype) was confirmed for each frozen retrospective sample, and the samples were blinded and randomized before testing at multiple clinical sites with the Shiga Toxin Direct Test.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Clinical performance of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test was evaluated in a multi-site prospective clinical study at five sites during a three-month period from June to September 2015. A combined total of 1,116 stool samples were enrolled and evaluated. Of these, 1,082 clinical specimens met the inclusion criteria and were used to evaluate the performance of the Shiga Toxin Direct Test. The specimens were collected from 471 males and 611 females with ages ranging from less than one month old to greater than 85 years old. A total of 12 Shiga toxin positive samples were observed across all five test sites $( 1 . 1 \% )$ . Two (2) of the 12 Shiga toxin positive specimens were also positive for O157 serotype $( 1 6 . 7 \% )$ .
