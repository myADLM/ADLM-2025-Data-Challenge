# SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification OIR Decision Summary

To: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention RE: K153148

This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own Class II devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:

1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device. CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel, Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit (K141859)

2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for use, package labeling.

3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including to demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.

This device modification involved small changes to the primers and probes of the assay. The gene target and location of the primers has not changed from the predicated device. The diagnostic panel includes two assays H5a and H5b. Three primers and 1 probe were added to the H5a assay in addition to minor nucleotide changes to adapt the assay to the evolution of the highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5. One primer was added to the H5b assay and minor nucleotide changes were made. Additionally the fluorescent probe quencher chemistry was changed to use the ZEN™ and Iowa Black $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ FQ quenchers on the probes included in the H5a and H5b assays.

To show that there was no impact on the performance of the assay with the modifications listed above a limit of detection study, analytical inclusivity study, analytical cross-reactivity study with non H5 influenza A viruses and microorganisms, and a small mock clinical study were conducted.

# Limit of Detection Study:

Analytical sensitivity of the Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit was demonstrated by determining the LoD using Quanta qScriptTM and Invitrogen SuperScriptTM enzyme kits. The LoD for each primer and probe set was confirmed by testing extraction replicates $( n = 2 0 )$ of the highest virus dilution where $2 9 5 \%$ of all replicates tested positive. Virus dilutions were prepared in virus transport medium containing human A549 cells to emulate clinical specimen matrix. The lowest concentration where the InfA and both H5a and H5b primer and probe sets demonstrate uniform detection was reported as the LoD. The results are summarized in the table below.

# Analytical Sensitivity-Inclusivity Testing:

Inclusivity testing was conducted to demonstrate the capability of the modified oligonucleotide primers and probes in the Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit to detect strains of influenza A/H5 viruses (Asian lineage) representative of different geographic locations and phylogenetic clades at or near the established LoD. Inclusivity testing was performed with sixteen representative H5 viruses (Asian lineage). A virus of the phylogenetic clade 2.2.2.1 was unavailable for testing therefore reactivity of the probes with A/Bangladesh/3222/2011 was performed in silico. The remaining fifteen viruses were grown to high titer, harvested, and serially diluted to near the LoD of the assays. The diluted influenza A/H5 viruses were extracted and tested in triplicate with the InfA, H5a, and H5b assays to demonstrate reactivity. Inclusivity of the Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit was evaluated with both enzyme systems (i.e. Invitrogen SuperScript™ and Quanta qScript™) and one cleared extraction method.

The Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit was reactive with all H5 (Asian lineage) isolates that were tested and predicted to be reactive with the influenza A/Bangladesh/3222/2011 based on the in silico analyses.

# Analytical Specificity –Cross-Reactivity

Cross-reactivity of the Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit was evaluated by testing influenza A viruses of different types and subtypes that include viruses representing diverse geographic locations and different sources. Samples were tested in triplicate using RNA extracted from high titer preparations of viruses $( \geq 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathsf { E l D 5 0 / m L } )$ . Cross-reactivity testing of the Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit was evaluated with the Invitrogen SuperscriptTM enzyme system and one cleared extraction method. The results showed no cross-reactivity with any non-influenza A H5 virus strains.

An exclusivity study was performed to demonstrate the specificity of each primer and probe set of the Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit when tested with common non-influenza human respiratory viruses, respiratory bacteria, and commensal organisms of the human respiratory tract. Nucleic acids were purified from thirty-five (35) non-influenza organisms (16 viruses, 18 bacteria, and 1 yeast) representing common respiratory pathogens or flora commonly present in specimens collected from the human nasopharynx region. High titer preparations of bacteria and yeast, generally greater than or equal to $1 0 ^ { \circ }$ cfu/mL, and non-influenza respiratory virus preparations at concentrations greater than ${ 1 0 ^ { 6 } }$ TCID50/mL were tested (except in cases where production of high titer virus stock was not possible). The Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit was evaluated with the Invitrogen SuperscriptTM enzyme system and one cleared extraction method. No cross-reactivity was detected with any of the organisms tested.

# Mock Clinical Study

The clinical performance of oligonucleotide primer and probe sets of the Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit were evaluated using contrived samples of grown virus added to an A549 cell suspension to simulate positive clinical samples. A total of fifty positive contrived samples at high, moderate, and low concentrations were evaluated. In addition, sixty-five specimens that tested negative for influenza A with the CDC Human Influenza rRT-PCR Diagnostic Panel that were obtained from a clinical study conducted during the 2011-2012 influenza season were evaluated. Testing was performed with both enzymes cleared for use with the kit. The results are summarized in the table below.

The results of the analysis indicated hazardous situations could arise as a result of the modifications and risk control measures should be implemented. A protocol was developed to perform analytical and clinical performance testing (as detailed in section 3) to mitigate the risk of hazardous situations occurring. The results of the testing reduced the probability of occurrence and the risk to the negligible.

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
