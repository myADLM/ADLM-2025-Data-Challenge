# SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification OIR Decision Summary

To: Hologic, Inc.

This special 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own Class II device requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:

1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device.

Trade Name: Prodesse $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ProFlu $^ { \mathsf { T M } } +$ Assay 510(k) number: K132129

2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for use and package labeling.

The submitter states the intended use remains the same (510k summary). The intended use included for the new device is the same as the intended use in the predicate (k132129).

3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S).

The modification presented in this special 510(k) is the inclusion of one additional viral strain to the table of analytical reactivity in the labeling. The submitter tested the ability of the Prodesse ProFlu+ Assay to detect the Influenza A/H3N2 strain, A/New York/1/2015. A clinical isolate with a confirmed identity and titer was diluted in negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix to a concentration $\left( 2 \times 1 0 \right) ^ { 1 }$ $\mathsf { T C l D 5 0 } / \mathsf { m l } )$ near the estimated LoD. The reactivity of the strain at this concentration was tested with three replicate samples. The assay detected each of the three replicates. This strain was added to the table of reactive strains in the package insert.

The predicate included an equivalency study to claim two extraction methods (Roche MagNA Pure LC and bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG), but the predicate used only the Roche instrument in the analytical reactivity study. The new device modification used the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG to extract the additional strain for reactivity. Therefore, the analytical reactivity section of the new package insert labeling was revised to include the statement “Viral strains were extracted using the Roche MagNA Pure LC or bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG and tested in triplicate in each assay.” This statement is a new revision of the package insert.

The analytical reactivity section of the new package insert was revised to include the statement “Viruses present at concentrations below those tested for Reactivity may not be detected by the ProFlu+ Assay.” This statement is not included in the predicate labeling, but it does not change the safety or effectiveness of the device.

During interactive review, the labeling (instructions for use) was revised to include “Rx only” on the front page. The predicate had no “Rx only” in the package insert.

In this submission, there were two new versions of package insert that are identical except that each had a different order number and different number of reactions included in the kit (either 100 and 1500 Rxns, or 2000 Rxns). The predicate had only one version of package insert (100 and 1500 Rxns).

4. The FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.

The product description in the labeling of the device is the same as the predicate and the submitter stated that the scientific technology is unchanged compared to the predicate.

5. Comparison Information (similarities and differences) to applicant’s legally marketed predicate device including labeling, intended use, other characteristics.

6. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:

1. Reactivity testing was conducted as described in Section 3, Device Modifications.

2. Risk Analysis

The method used for the Risk Analysis for the Prodesse ProFlu $^ +$ Assay was the Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA). This method is consistent with 21 CFR 820.30. The following table summarizes the risk analysis.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Assay</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>No.</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>PotentialCause ofFailure</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Risk</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>RiskPriorityNumber(RPN)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Justification</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ProFlu+</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>30</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>New strainemerges andits nucleicacidsequence isundetectableby the device</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Original</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>30</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Ongoing Risk Controlactivities include continuedmonitoring of all complaints,tracking circulating strainsand any pertinent sequenceinformation at leastannually.Testing showed that nucleicacid of the new strain,A/New York/1/2015, isdetectable by theProFlu+Assay at aconcentration comparable toother H3N2 strains listed inReactivity section of the IFU(2x101 TCID50/mL).</td></tr></table>

The risk of a false negative result was identified as a potential hazard that could occur if a new strain emerges and its nucleic acid sequence is undetectable by the device. This risk was addressed by conducting reactivity testing of an additional viral strain with the ProFlu+ assay and through updating the package insert.

# 3. Declaration of Conformity to Design Controls

A “Declaration of Conformity” statement was submitted for the Hologic manufacturing facility. It was signed by an R&D Scientist, and the Regulatory Affairs Manager. The statements indicate that:

a. “To the best of my knowledge, the verification activities for the modification were performed by the designated individual(s) and the results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance criteria were met.”   
b. The manufacturing facility, Hologic, Inc. is in conformance with the design control requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820. 3 0 and the records are available for review.

7. A Truth and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary and the Indications for Use enclosure were included in the submission.

# 8. Conclusion

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.
