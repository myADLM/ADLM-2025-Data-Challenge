# Intended Use

The EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA (IgM) is intended for the qualitative detection of IgM antibodies to West Nile virus in human serum and plasma $\mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ -EDTA, $\mathrm { L i } ^ { + }$ -heparin). This test is intended as an aid in the presumptive laboratory diagnosis of West Nile virus infection in patients with clinical symptoms consistent with meningitis/encephalitis, in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings. Positive results must be confirmed by the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) or by using the current CDC guidelines for diagnosis of this disease.

The assay characteristics have not been established for testing cord blood, neonates, prenatal screening, and general population screening of patients without symptoms of meningoencephalitis. This assay is not FDA cleared or approved for testing blood or plasma donors.

Warning: Cross-reactivity with IgM to Dengue virus, Malaria/anti-Plasmodium falciparum and Parvovirus B19 has been observed with the EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA (IgM). Reactive results must be reported with a caution statement regarding possible IgM cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses.

# Device Description

Patient serum or plasma samples are diluted 1:101 in sample buffer and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature to allow $\mathrm { I g G / R F }$ separation. $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ of each diluted patient sample and pre-diluted controls and calibrator are added to the antigen coated microtiter wells and incubated for 60 minutes at $+ 3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . After incubation the microtiter well strips are washed 3 times with wash buffer to remove unbound antibodies and $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ of the anti-human $\mathrm { I g M }$ enzyme conjugate reagent is added to each microtiter well. After an additional 30 minutes incubation at room temperature, the microtiter wells are again washed 3 times with wash buffer to remove any unbound enzyme conjugate and $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ of the chromogen substrate is added. The strips are incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature and $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ stop solution is added. The microtiter plates are placed in an ELISA reader and read at a wavelength of $4 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ and a reference wavelength of between $6 2 0 \mathrm { n m }$ and 650 nm within 30 minutes.

# Test Principle

The test kit contains 12 microtiter strips each with 8 break-off reagent wells coated with West Nile virus antigen. In the first reaction step, diluted patient samples, calibrators and controls are incubated in the wells. Anti-West Nile virus antibodies will bind to the antigens coated in the microtiter wells. The wells are washed to remove any unbound proteins and non-specific antibodies. In a second reaction step, goat anti-human IgM HRP enzyme conjugate is added to each well. The enzyme conjugate will bind to any wells that have human IgM binding to the West Nile virus antigen. The wells are washed to remove any unbound HRP enzyme conjugate. 3,3,5,5 tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) enzyme substrate is added. If the HRP enzyme is present in the well (positive reaction), the HRP enzyme will react with the TMB substrate and produce a blue color. After an additional incubation time to allow the color development, a stop solution is added which turns the blue color yellow and inhibits further color development to allow for a stable spectrophotometric reading. The test strips are placed in a microplate reader and the optical density of the color is measured. The amount of antigen specific bound antibody is proportional to the color intensity.

Interference: Hemolytic, lipemic and icteric samples showed no influence on the result up to a concentration of $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ for hemoglobin, $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ for triglycerides and $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ for bilirubin in testing with the EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA (IgM). Interferences to high protein (albumin), cholesterol, and intralipids were not investigated.

# Assay Cut-off:

The recommended assay cut-off is based on OD results of 18 sera from clinically characterized positive West Nile virus patients and of 150 sera from normal healthy blood donors from a non-endemic region (100 men, 50 women; mean age 39.9 years, age range 18 to 68 years). The samples were investigated using the EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA (IgM) and a ROC analysis was performed using the OD’s obtained. The ROC analysis demonstrated optimal sensitivity $( 1 0 0 . 0 \% )$ and specificity $( 9 7 . 3 \% )$ at the OD value of 0.217. The calibrator was established at this cut-off OD.

The borderline range of ratio 0.8 to ratio 1.1 was established to cover at least $9 5 \%$ of the negative samples (143 of 150 samples) in the negative range.

Using the cut-off of ratio 1.0 and borderline range of ratio 0.8 to 1.1 with the positive and negative groups mentioned above, the EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA $( \mathrm { I g } \mathrm { M } )$ showed a sensitivity of $1 0 0 . 0 \%$ $9 5 \%$ C.I.: $8 1 . 5 - 1 0 0 . 0 \% )$ with a specificity of $9 5 . 3 \%$ ( $9 5 \%$ C.I.: $9 0 . 6 - 9 8 . 1 \%$ ).

Clinical Study I:

A prospective clinical study was performed with 155 samples from patients suspected of West Nile Virus infection collected at hospitals and clinics across the US in 2015. The panel consisted of 83 men and 72 women, age ranged from 6 to 85 years with a mean age of 49 years. Each specimen was tested at one internal and two external sites with the EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA (IgM) in parallel with the predicate assay. Average of three results for each clinical specimen tested at three sites was considered to calculate the positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement between the EUROIMMUN Anti-West Nile Virus ELISA $( \mathrm { I g } \mathrm { M } )$ vs reference assay. The following results were obtained.

# Matrix Comparison (Serum vs Plasma)

The usability of plasma was investigated using sample sets each of serum and corresponding plasma (EDTA, Li-heparin). As no real plasma sample sets from patients containing anti-West Nile virus antibodies were available, the samples were created from 5 different sets of normal blood donor sample sets (serum, EDTA plasma, Li-heparin plasma) that were (after drawing) spiked with 5 different positive serum samples. After spiking, the sample sets were further diluted and processed according to the package insert.

Passing-Bablok regression was calculated for the comparison of serum to plasma. The regression equation is near the ideal correlation (intercept 0; slope 1.0) indicating equivalence of concentrations between serum and the corresponding plasma matrices. Coefficients of determination were found to be above 0.970 and $\%$ recovery compared to serum was in the range of 83 to $123 \%$ (serum $= 1 0 0 \%$ ).
