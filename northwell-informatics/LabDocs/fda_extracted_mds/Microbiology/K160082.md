Dear Mr. Karamchi:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).

# 5.5 Device Description

Puritan Opti-Tranz Cary-Blair Collection and Transport System is comprised of a sterile peel pouch containing a rayon tipped swab applicator for collecting specimens and a polypropylene tube containing $5 \mathrm { m } |$ of Cary-Blair medium.

Cary-Blair medium is a nonnutritive balanced salt solution containing disodium phosphate to provide buffering capability, sodium chloride and calcium chloride to provide essential ions that help maintain osmotic balance. Agar is a solidifying agent and gives a semisolid texture to the medium. Sodium thioglycollate provides a reduced environment. It is recommended for maintaining the viability of enteric bacteria during the transport to the laboratory.

# 5.6 Intended Use

Puritan Opti-Tranz Cary-Blair Collection and Transport System is intended for use in the collection and transport of clinical fecal and rectal swab specimens to preserve the viability of enteric bacteria during transport from the collection site to the testing laboratory for bacteriological examination and culture.

# 5.7 Indication(s) For Use

Puritan Opti-Tranz Cary-Blair Collection and Transport System is intended for use in the collection and transport of clinical fecal and rectal swab specimens to preserve the viability of enteric bacteria during transport from the collection site to the testing laboratory for bacteriological examination and culture.

# 5.8. Substantial Equivalence statement

Puritan Opti-Tranz Cary-Blair Collection and Transport System is similar in design, manufacturing and intended usage to the predicate device. Both the Puritan and the predicate device are single-use devices intended for collection and transport of clinical specimens containing enteric bacteria from the patient site to the testing laboratory for bacteriological examination and culture.

# 5.9 Recovery Testing

To determine the ability of the Puritan Opti-Tranz Cary-Blair Collection and Transport System to maintain viability of different strains of enteric bacteria, known inoculum of clinically significant ATCC type culture microorganisms were inoculated into the Puritan Opti-Tranz Cary-Blair Collection and Transport medium and compared to the predicate device following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M40-A2 guidelines. No notable differences in recovery were detected between the Puritan Opti-Tranz Cary-Blair Collection and Transport System and the predicate device.

Recovery was also evaluated using three representative challenge organisms to demonstrate that the performance of the Puritan Opti-Tranz Cary-Blair Collection and Transport medium is not adversely affected by fecal material. It was determined that clinical fecal material does not notably alter the recovery of the challenge organisms from the Puritan Opti-Tranz Cary-Blair Collection and Transport System.

# 5.10 Stability Testing

Stability tests were performed on Puritan Opti-Tranz Cary-Blair Collection and Transport System to verify the ability of the aged products to maintain microbial recovery up to the expiry date.

# 5.11 pH Stability

The pH of the test device was measured at predetermined time intervals for up to 20 months after manufacturing date. The test was performed using calibrated pH meter with random samples from three different lots of Puritan Opti-Tranz Cary-Blair Collection and Transport System. All samples tested were found to maintain pH within the specified range.

# 5.12 Cytotoxicity

Cytotoxicity testing was conducted to evaluate the glue, shaft and the rayon tipped swabs for potential cytotoxicity effect following ISO Elution Method-1X MEM Extract. No evidence of cytotoxicity was detected.

# 5.13 Sterilization

Puritan Opti-Tranz Cary-Blair Collection and Transport System is sterilized by gamma irradiation and validated following ANSI/AAMI/ISO 11137:2006, Sterilization of health care products Radiation guidelines.

# 5.14 Conclusion

The conclusions drawn from the nonclinical tests demonstrate the device is as safe and effective as the legally marketed device identified above.
