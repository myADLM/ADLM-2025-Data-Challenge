A negative test is presumptive and it is recommended that these results be confirmed by viral culture or an FDA- cleared influenza A and B molecular assay.

# 5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:

a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis.

The Risk Assessment process used was based on a BD Product Risk Management procedure, which, according to the sponsor, meets the requirement for risk management as set forth in ISO 14971:2007 and EN ISO 14971:2012.

Using this procedure, the following characteristics were assessed and the results are presented in Table 3 below:

• The Hazard, • The Adverse Effect (Harm to Patient), • The Potential Causes of the Hazard, • The probability of Hazard Severity and • The probability of Occurrence

b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.

The risk assessment identified the need to confirm the Veritor System’s reactivity to the CDC H5Nx Virus Panel provided as part of the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework and to add the results to a package insert available to the public.

In order to demonstrate reactivity with the A/H5 viruses and present the data in a revised Package Insert, a reactivity study was conducted. The study acceptance criterion was a positive instrument read with samples of the subject influenza viruses when tested by the BD VeritorTM Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ CLIA Waived kit assay.

The lowest concentrations of influenza A/H5 viruses that were detected by the VeritorTM System Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ assay are listed in Table 1. The strain reactivity data provided above and proposed for inclusion into the PI demonstrate that all strains tested met the acceptance criteria.

The studies conducted on the BD Veritor™ System Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ assay support the proposed labeling changes to reflect the analytical reactivity data generated. This data will be used to update the strain reactivity section of the product insert.

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
