Device Name

BD Veritor ™ System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathbf { A } + \mathbf { B }$ Laboratory Kit

Indications for Use (Describe) INTENDED USE

The BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathrm { A } { + } \mathrm { B }$ is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the direct and qualitative detection of influenza A and B viral nucleoprotein antigens from nasopharyngeal wash, aspirate, and swab in transport media samples from symptomatic patients. The BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathrm { A + B }$ is a differentiated test, such that influenza A viral antigens can be distinguished from influenza B viral antigens from a single processed sample using a single device. The test is to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza A and B viral infections. A negative test is presumptive and it is recommended that these results be confirmed by viral culture or an FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay. Outside the U.S. a negative test is presumptive and it is recommended that these results be confirmed by viral culture or a molecular assay cleared for diagnostic use in the country of use. FDA has not cleared this device outside the U.S. Negative test results do not preclude influenza viral infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. The test is not intended to detect influenza C antigens.

Performance characteristics for influenza A and B nasopharyngeal (NP) washes/aspirates were established during January through March of 2011 when influenza viruses A/2009 H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria lineage, and B/Yamagata lineage were the predominant influenza viruses in circulation according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the CDC entitled “Update: Influenza Activity—United States, 2010-2011 Season, and Composition of the 2011-2012 Influenza Vaccine.” Performance characteristics may vary against other emerging influenza viruses.

Performance characteristics for influenza A and B NP swabs in transport media were established during January through April of 2012 when influenza viruses A/2009 H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria lineage, and B/Yamagata lineage were the predominant influenza viruses in circulation according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the CDC entitled “Update: Influenza Activity—United States, 2011-2012 Season, and Composition of the 2012-2013 Influenza Vaccine.” Performance characteristics may vary against other emerging influenza viruses.

If infection with a novel influenza virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to the state or local health department for testing. Virus culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION :

The BD VeritorTM Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ test is an immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative detection of influenza A and B viral antigens in respiratory specimens. The patient specimen is added to a reaction tube prefilled with RV Reagent C, gently mixed, and then added to the test device. RV Reagent C contains mucolytic agents that function to break down mucus in a patient specimen thereby exposing viral antigens and enhancing detection on the assay device. Processed specimens are expressed through a filter tip into a single sample well on the BD VeritorTM Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ test device.

After addition to the test device, any influenza A or influenza B viral antigens present in the specimen bind to anti-influenza antibodies conjugated to detector particles on the VeritorTM Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ test strip. The antigen-conjugate complexes migrate across the test strip to the reaction area and are captured by a line of antibody striped on the membrane. The VeritorTM Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ test devices are designed with five spatially-distinct zones including positive and negative control line positions, separate test line positions for the target analytes, and a background zone. The test lines for the target analytes are labeled on the test device as ‘A’ for Flu A position, and ‘B’ for Flu B position. The onboard positive control ensures the sample has flowed correctly and is indicated on the test device as $" C '$ . Two of the five distinct zones on the test device are not labeled. These two zones are an onboard negative control line and an assay background zone. The onboard negative control zone addresses non-specific signal generation. The remaining zone is used to measure the assay background.

The BD VeritorTM Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ assay incorporates an active negative control feature in each test to identify and compensate for sample-related, nonspecific signal generation. The BD Veritor™ System Reader uses a proprietary algorithm that subtracts nonspecific signal at the negative control line from the signal present at both the Flu A and Flu B test lines. If the resultant test line signal is above a pre-selected assay cutoff, the specimen scores as positive. If the resultant test line signal is below the cutoff, the specimen scores as negative. Use of the active negative control feature allows the BD Veritor™ System reader to correctly interpret test results that cannot be scored visually because the human eye is unable to accurately perform the subtraction of the nonspecific signal.

# DEVICE COMPARISON:

The modified device differs from the currently marketed BD Veritor™ System Flu $\mathsf { A } +$ B in the following way:

The labeling has been changed to reflect the addition of strain reactivity data for the following strains:
