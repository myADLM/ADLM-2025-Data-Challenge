A test is initiated by loading Hydration Solution into one port of the FilmArray pouch and a CSF sample mixed with the provided Sample Buffer into the other port of the FilmArray ME pouch and placing it in the FilmArray Instrument. The pouch contains all of the reagents required for specimen testing and analysis in a freeze-dried format; the addition of Hydration Solution and Sample/Buffer Mix rehydrates the reagents. After the pouch is prepared, the FilmArray Software guides the user through the steps of placing the pouch into the instrument, scanning the pouch barcode, entering the sample identification, and initiating the run.

The FilmArray instrument contains a coordinated system of inflatable bladders and seal points, which act on the pouch to control the movement of liquid between the pouch blisters. When a bladder is inflated over a reagent blister, it forces liquid from the blister into connecting channels. Alternatively, when a seal is placed over a connecting channel it acts as a valve to open or close a channel. In addition, electronically controlled pneumatic pistons are positioned over multiple plungers in order to deliver the rehydrated reagents into the blisters at the appropriate times. Two Peltier devices control heating and cooling of the pouch to drive the PCR reactions and the melt curve analysis.

Nucleic acid extraction occurs within the FilmArray pouch using mechanical and chemical lysis followed by purification using standard magnetic bead technology. After extracting and purifying nucleic acids from the unprocessed sample, a nested multiplex PCR is executed in two stages. During the first stage, a single, large volume, highly multiplexed reverse transcription PCR (rt-PCR) reaction is performed. The products from first stage PCR are then diluted and combined with a fresh, primer-free master mix and a fluorescent double stranded DNA binding dye (LC Green® Plus, BioFire Defense, LLC). The solution is then distributed to each well of the array. Array wells contain sets of primers designed specifically to amplify sequences internal to the PCR products generated during the first stage PCR reaction. The $\bar { 2 } ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ stage PCR, or nested PCR, is performed in each well of the array. At the conclusion of the $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ stage PCR, the array is interrogated by melt curve analysis for the detection of signature amplicons denoting the presence of specific targets. A digital camera placed in front of the array captures fluorescent images of the PCR2 reactions and software interprets the data.

The FilmArray software automatically interprets the results of each DNA melt curve analysis and combines the data with the results of the internal pouch controls to provide a test result for each organism on the panel.

# Device Comparison:

The purpose of this submission is to add FilmArray Torch as an additional instrument system for use with the FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis (ME) Panel. There have been no changes to the previously cleared FilmArray ME Panel reagent kit itself. In order to increase throughput capacity, the FilmArray 2.0 was modified to develop the FilmArray Torch by organizing densely packaged instruments (now called FilmArray Torch Modules) into a “tower” configuration having the computer with touchscreen interface incorporated into the system base. Pouches are now inserted horizontally rather than from the top. This configuration allows the FilmArray Torch Modules to be stacked directly on top of each other to minimize system footprint.

The following table compares the FilmArray ME Panel for use with the FilmArray Torch to the previously cleared FilmArray ME Panel for Use with the FilmArray 2.0 (DEN150013). The table outlines the similarities and differences between the two systems.

# Performance Characteristics of FilmArray ME Panel on FilmArray Torch

Contrived samples containing each FilmArray ME Panel analyte at low positive levels (1x LoD) were tested on three complete FilmArray Torch systems (12 FilmArray Torch Modules per system) over five days (30 replicates per analyte per system for 90 total replicates per analyte). Reproducible detection at LOD was confirmed for each FilmArray ME analyte with the expected Detected results for $2 9 5 . 6 \%$ of samples tested on FilmArray Torch systems. Agreement with the expected negative results (Not Detected) was $59 8 \%$ for each analyte.

# Conclusion:

The intended use and fundamental scientific technology of the FilmArray ME Panel used with the modified device, FilmArray Torch, is unchanged from use of the legally marketed FilmArray ME Panel on FilmArray and FilmArray 2.0 systems. Non-clinical validation studies have established that the performance characteristics of FilmArray ME, including reproducibility, are substantially equivalent on FilmArray, FilmArray 2.0, and FilmArray Torch. These data demonstrate that the device performs as well as the predicate device.
