1. The name and de novo application number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device.

Trade Name: FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis (ME) Panel for use with the FilmArray and   
FilmArray 2.0 systems   
De Novo Application: DEN150013

2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device, called “FilmArray $\textcircled{8}$ Meningitis/Encephalitis Panel for use with FilmArray systems,” as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for use, package labeling.

Submitter states in the 510(k) Summary and in the submission that the intended use of the modified device has not changed from its predicate. The intended use of the modified device remains the same in the labeling.

3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including clearly labeled diagrams, engineering drawings, photographs, user’s and/or service manuals in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.

The modifications made to the FilmArray 2.0 system to configure the FilmArray Torch aimed to increase throughput capacity and benchtop workspace through single tower housing. Changes include:

a reconfigured base instrument tower with optional, stacked, individual instrument modules, workflow altered for a manual read of the assay pouch’s bar-code by the operator instead of automatic read within instrument,   
automatic edge-loading mechanism is used to load hydration reagents and clinical samples instead of a manual top-loading technique,   
automatic partial ejection of the assay pouch following conclusion of a run rather than manual removal of the pouch,   
printer is optional instead of included with the system,   
computer, barcode scanner, and touch screen interface integrated into the base of the tower configuration instead of a separate computer set-up,   
operation with kiosk-style (touch-screen) software,   
labeling appended with an additional operational procedure and with statements describing the validation/verification studies (i.e. LoD and reproducibility); these studies included an intra-laboratory precision study for the modified device.

The indications for use provided below are identical for both devices.

# FilmArray 2.0 (K160462) Indications for use (same as DEN150013):

The FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis (ME) Panel is a qualitative multiplexed nucleic acid-based in vitro diagnostic test intended for use with FilmArray systems. The FilmArray ME Panel is capable of simultaneous detection and identification of multiple bacterial, viral, and yeast nucleic acids directly from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens obtained via lumbar puncture from individuals with signs and/or symptoms of meningitis and/or encephalitis. The following organisms are identified using the FilmArray ME Panel: Escherichia coli K1, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Neisseria meningitidis (encapsulated), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Cytomegalovirus, Enterovirus, Herpes simplex virus 1,

Herpes simplex virus 2, Human herpesvirus 6, Human parechovirus, Varicella zoster virus, and Cryptococcus neoformans/gatti.

The FilmArray ME Panel is indicated as an aid in the diagnosis of specific agents of meningitis and/or encephalitis and results are meant to be used in conjunction with other clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory data. Results from the FilmArray ME Panel are not intended to be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decisions. Positive results do not rule out co-infection with organisms not included in the FilmArray ME Panel. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of the disease. Negative results do not preclude central nervous system (CNS) infection. Not all agents of CNS infection are detected by this test and sensitivity in clinical use may differ from that described in the package insert.

The FilmArray ME Panel is not intended for testing of specimens collected from indwelling CNS medical devices.

The FilmArray ME Panel is intended to be used in conjunction with standard of care culture for organism recovery, serotyping, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

# 5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:

a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis

A risk analysis of the modifications made to reconfigure the FilmArray 2.0 system into the integrated tower configuration of the FilmArray Torch was successfully completed in the context of 21 CFR 807.81 and the appropriate guidance. Reconfiguration of the platform did not alter the performance or capabilities of the device when run with the FilmArray ME Panel. Risk management of the FilmArray Torch Software and Firmware followed processes that were compliant with ISO 14971:2012.

b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied

In order to both validate and verify the FilmArray ME Panel for use on the FilmArray Torch, studies were completed to address risks associated with false negative, false positive, and delayed or no results. An intra-laboratory precision study was conducted between three FilmArray Torch systems (containing three Torch modules within each system for a total of 9 FilmArray Torch Modules per sample) and three sets of three FilmArray 2.0 instruments for a total of 9 FilmArray instruments. Results demonstrated that all analytes in the FilmArray ME Panel (at $1 \mathsf { x } \mathsf { L O D } )$ were detected in at least $9 5 \%$ of the samples tested on both platforms. $100 \%$ of “Not Detected” results were observed for all analytes in the negative samples tested with the exception of $H .$ influenzae that demonstrated a $9 8 . 3 \%$ agreement with the expected negative result. Additionally, melting temperature values were evaluated among the systems and results fell within the acceptance criteria of a standard deviation of $\pm 0 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ or less for each target (known system variation on the FilmArray).

Method comparison studies were conducted for the modified device (FilmArray Torch with ME Panel) and its predicate device (FilmArray 2.0 with ME Panel). These included a synthetic template method comparison study, a negative sample method comparison study, and a representative organism method comparison study. For all studies, the positive agreement was $2 9 5 \%$ and the negative agreement was $100 \%$ .

An additional study was completed using the WHO International Standard for Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) for Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques on the FilmArray and FilmArray 2.0 systems. The standard was tested at the previously established LoD concentration. When testing samples containing the WHO CMV standard, CMV was detected by the FilmArray ME Panel in $100 \%$ of the replicates tested at the confirmed LoD concentration on both FilmArray systems. This information was included in the revised package insert.

c) Declaration of Conformity with Design Controls

A “Declaration of Conformity” statement was submitted for the BioFire Diagnostics, LLC manufacturing facility. It was signed by the Vice President, Regulated Products and Clinical Affairs, and the Director of Quality Assurance. The statements indicate that:

i. “To the best of my knowledge, the verification activities, as required by the risk analysis, for the modification were performed by the designated individual(s) and the results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance criteria were met.”   
ii. “The manufacturing facility, BioFire Diagnostics, LLC, is in conformance with the design control requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and the records are available for review.”

# 6. Conclusion

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
