# 1. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay is a two-step sandwich immunoassay with streptavidin microparticles and an electrochemiluminescence detection system. PCT in the sample reacts with these labeled antibodies to form a sandwich complex. This complex binds to streptavidin coated magnetic microparticles, which are magnetically captured onto an electrode. Application of voltage to the electrode induces chemiluminescence which is measured by a photomultiplier tube. Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument-specifically generated by 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode. An optional Procalcitonin CalCheck product is also available.

# 1.1. Reagents

The reagent working solutions include:

Rackpack (kit placed on analyzer)

M: Streptavidin-coated microparticles, • R1: Anti-PCT-Ab\~biotin 2+ • R2: Anti-PCT – Ab\~Ru(bpy)

# 1.2. Calibrator

PCT CalSet is a 2-level PCT calibrator consisting of lyophilized recombinant PCT in a human serum matrix. The CalSet includes:

• PCT Cal1: approximately $0 . 1 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , 1 bottle, containing 4 mL • PCT Cal2: approximately $5 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , 1 bottle, containing 4 mL

# 1.3. Control

PreciControl PCT is a single analyte control that is used for quality control of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay. The PreciControl PCT includes:

• PC PCT 1: approximately $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , 2 bottles each for $4 \mathrm { m L }$ • PC PCT 2: approximately $1 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , 2 bottles each for $4 \mathrm { m L }$

# 1.4. CalCheck

PCT CalCheck 5 is a lyophilized Human serum matrix with added PCT in five concentration ranges. The CalCheck includes:

• PCT CalCheck 1: approximately $< 0 . 0 6 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ • PCT CalCheck 2: approximately $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ • PCT CalCheck 3: approximately $4 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ • PCT CalCheck 4: approximately $8 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ • PCT CalCheck 5: approximately $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$

# 2. INDICATIONS FOR USE

Immunoassay for the in vitro quantitative determination of PCT (procalcitonin) in human serum and plasma (K2 and K3 EDTA, Li-Heparin).

The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay is intended for use to determine the change of PCT over time as an aid in assessing the cumulative 28-day risk of all-cause mortality for patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or when obtained in the emergency department or other medical wards prior to ICU admission.

The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” is intended for use on Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.

Procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker associated with the inflammatory response to bacterial infection that aids in the risk assessment of critically ill patients on their first day of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission for progression to severe sepsis and septic shock. The percent change in PCT level over time aids in the prediction of cumulative 28-day mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

A PCT level that declines $\leq 8 0 \%$ from the day that severe sepsis or septic shock was clinically diagnosed (Day 0) to four days after clinical diagnosis (Day 4) is associated with higher cumulative 28-day risk of all-cause mortality than a decline $> 8 0 \%$ .

The combination of the first PCT level $( \leq 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ or $> 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ) at initial diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock with the patient’s clinical course and the change in PCT level over time until Day 4 provides important additional information about the mortality risk.

The PCT level on Day 1 (the day after severe sepsis or septic shock is first clinically diagnosed) can be used to calculate the percent change in PCT level at Day 4 if the Day 0 measurement is unavailable.

# 3. DISCUSSION OF ANALYZER PLATFORMS

The following summary of the Elecsys platforms is provided.

The cobas e 411 analyzer is an updated version of the Elecsys 2010 analyzer. Roche Diagnostics pursued a conservative course and submitted a 510(k) for the analyzer under K062279. The submission was closed out under ‘exempt’ since the submission was only for the analyzer and the ‘Joint Risk Assessment’ performed internally identified no potential impact on reagent performance. However, to be on the conservative side, Roche Diagnostics conducted recovery and reproducibility testing with representative Elecsys assays, and those data are documented

internally. The modifications did not alter the measurement components of the analyzer or the means by which results are calculated. The systems are analytically identical. The majority of the hardware changes, outside of the obvious name change, were cosmetic (e.g., change to color scheme, an external PC versus an internal PC) or related to safety (e.g., protective shields added over moving parts), or were made to improve customer satisfaction (e.g., a larger external waste container, flash drive replacement of floppy drive). The user-interface changes were made for aesthetics, customer satisfaction, or to bring the ‘old’ 2010 analyzer up to parity with those features already designed into the cobas 6000 series system.

The cobas e 601 analyzer is an updated version of the MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 analyzer. The MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 analyzer was acknowledged by FDA under Addto-File K961481/A003 on May 23, 2001. The cobas e 601 analyzer was reviewed and cleared as a component of the cobas 6000 series system submission K060373. The submission was required to introduce the other component of the cobas 6000 series system: the cobas c 501 analyzer, a new clinical-chemistry analyzer.

The cobas e 602 analyzer, part of the cobas 8000 analyzer series, was cleared via Internal Documentation, in keeping with the Reagent Replacement and Instrument Family Policy, as a new member of the Roche/Elecsys family of analyzers. The cobas e 602 is analytically identical to the cobas e 601 analyzer, part of the cobas 6000 analyzer series cleared in K060373.

# 5. NON-CLINICAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

Non-clinical performance evaluations for the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay executed with the study briefly summarized.

# 5.1. Precision (Human Sera)

Precision of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was evaluated on one cobas e 411 analyzer according to CLSI EP5-A3 guideline. One reagent lot was evaluated.

The protocol consisted of testing two replicates of each control (PC PCT 1 and PC PCT 2) and six human serum samples per run, two runs per day for 21 days. The samples were run in randomized order on the analyzer.

Repeatability and Intermediate precision were calculated according to CLSI EP5-A3.

# 5.2. Limit of Blank (LoB)

For the analytical sensitivity studies, the Limit of Blank was determined according to CLSI EP17- A2. The LoB was determined as the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of blank-sample measurements. The distribution of values for five analyte-free serum samples was determined with one reagent lot on one cobas e 411 anaylzer over three days for six runs total.

The samples were measured in two-fold determination for each run. A total of 60 measuring points were collected.

# 5.3. Limit of Detection (LoD)

For the analytical sensitivity studies, the Limit of Detection was determined according is the smallest amount of analyte that can be detected with $9 5 \%$ probability. The distribution of values for five low-level human serum samples was determined with one reagent lot on one cobas e 411 anaylzer over three days for six runs total.

The samples were measured in two-fold determination for each run. A total of 60 measuring points were collected.

# 5.4. Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)

The Limit of Quantitation was determined according to CLSI EP17-A2. The LoQ represents the lowest amount of analyte that can be quantitatively determined with stated accuracy, precision, and experimental conditions. For Procalcitonin, no reference material or reference method is available, thus bias cannot be calculated. Therefore, the LoQ was calculated based on intermediate precision according to CLSI EP17-A2. The LoQ was determined as the lowest concentration of analyte that can be quantified with an intermediate precision of no more than $20 \%$ .

A five-day precision experiment was carried out with one reagent lot on one cobas e 411 analyzer. Samples tested included five human serum (HS) samples with concentrations from LoB to two times the LoQ. Samples were measured in five-fold determination for each run. A total of 125 measuring points were collected.

The mean values and the intermediate precision (coefficient of variation and standard deviation) for each LoQ sample were calculated. To determine the LoQ, samples were sorted according to the concentration of their measured mean value. The LoQ is defined as the mean value of the sample that is first to fulfill the specification for intermediate precision, and for which there is no lower-concentration sample that exceeds the specification.

# 5.5. Linearity

The linearity results were obtained with serum samples on one cobas e 411 analyzer. Three spiked human plasma samples and three spiked human serum samples were diluted into six dilution series with each series containing at least 14 dilutions. Samples were assayed in threefold determination within a single run.

The linearity data were analyzed with regards to linear, quadratic, and cubic polynomials, according to CLSI EP6-A. In the first step, a linearity check was performed with a first order (linear) regression, and then with high order models (quadratic and cubic).

# 5.6. Dilution Study

To demonstrate the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay dilution study, three different dilutions with dilution factors between 1:1 and 1:5 were prepared. Three serum samples and one plasma sample were spiked with PCT to concentrations exceeding the measuring range. The samples were diluted with serum (low PCT concentrations) and recovery was investigated on the cobas e 411.

# 5.7. Analytical Specificity

The specificity of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was determined using native human serum samples spiked with potential cross-reacting compounds. The spiked and unspiked reference samples were measured in duplicate on one Elecsys 2010 analyzer. Specificity was determined using two human serum sample pools spiked with potential cross-reactant compounds at four different concentrations each. The analyte concentration of the samples was at approximately 0.4 and $1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ PCT. Cross-reactivity results will be reported in the method sheet.

# 5.8. Endogenous Interferences

The effect on quantitation of PCT in the presence of five endogenous interfering substances (Hemoglobin, Biotin, Intralipid, Bilirubin, and Rheumatoid Factor) was tested using one Elecsys 2010 analyzer. Spiked serum pools were used for testing.

For each potential interferent, three human serum samples (containing low, mid, and high concentrations of PCT) were tested.

# 5.9. HAMA Effect

The effect of the presence of human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) on the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was assessed on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer.

A suitable HAMA serum was spiked with PCT analyte at multiple concentrations covering the clinically relevant range. In parallel, a control (human serum) sample was spiked with the same levels of analyte. For each analyte concentration, a series of 11 dilutions of the HAMA sample and control sample were each prepared and measured in duplicate. The recovery for each sample was calculated by comparison to the reference (no HAMA) sample.

# 5.10. High-Dose Hook Effect

The high-dose hook effect of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was assessed on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer. Human serum pools were spiked with analyte up to a concentration of 2,500 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ . These samples were subsequently diluted with negative human serum.

The expected values for the diluted samples were calculated using the known spiked PCT analyte concentration of the undiluted sample and the appropriate dilution factor.

The hook concentration reported corresponds to the analyte concentration that generates a signal $2 1 0 \%$ above the upper limit of the measuring range

# 5.11. Exogenous Interferences – Drugs

The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of drugs was determined by comparing values obtained from samples spiked with 27 pharmaceutical compounds into two human serum samples at differing analyte concentrations and tested on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer.

The PCT concentration of the spiked aliquots was tested in two-fold determination and compared to the PCT concentration for the reference aliquot (also tested in two-fold determination).

# 5.12. Serum/Plasma Comparison

The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of anticoagulants with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was determined by comparing values obtained from samples drawn into Serum Separator Tubes (SST), Serum, Li-Heparin Plasma, K2-, K3-EDTA and Plasma primary tubes and Plasma Separation Tubes (PST). Ten human serum samples were tested in duplicate on one Elecsys 2010 analyzer at three time points for SST. For remaining Serum/Plasma comparison studies, a minimum of 50 serum/plasma pairs were tested with one reagent lot on one cobas e 411 analyzer. Potential effects were assessed by Passing/Bablok regression analysis.

# 5.13. Method Comparison

A method comparison study was performed to compare the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay on the cobas e 601 analyzer with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay on the cobas e 411 analyzer. A total of 137 human serum samples with PCT values from $0 . 0 6 8 1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ to $9 9 . 1 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ were measured.

The results were calculated using Passing/Bablok and Linear Regression analyses.

# 5.14. Reagent Stability

To test reagent stability, three studies were executed.

5.14.1. Study 1. Reagent Stability (On Board)   
Reagent on-board stability for the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was tested on one Elecsys 2010 analyzer.

A fresh reagent Rack Pack was placed on the analyzer and calibrated. Reference values for the samples tested were determined. On day 7 and day 28 the same samples were determined with the same reagent kit (kept on board the instrument) using the calibration curve of day 0 and day 21 respectively.

Samples tested in duplicate include five human serum samples and two controls.

# 5.14.2. Study 2. Reagent Stability (After Opening)

Reagent stability after first opening for the Elecsys BRAHMS PCt assay was tested on one Elecsys 2010 analyzer.

A fresh reagent Rack Pack was placed on the analyzer and calibrated. Reference values for the samples tested were determined. After measurement, the kit was removed from the analyzer and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 12 weeks. The kit was again placed on the analyzer, calibrated, and the samples were tested.

Samples tested included five human serum samples and two controls.

# 5.14.3. Study 3. Reagent Stability (Real-Time Shelf Life)

In the real-time, shelf-life stability study, the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay reagent was stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The stored reagent was tested at time point 0 (at manufacture), then again at specified intervals over the shelf life of the device (up to the planned shelf life plus one month).

Samples tested in duplicate include human serum samples from three reagent lots and two controls.

# 5.15. Sample Stability

To test reagent stability, four studies were executed.

5.15.1. Study 1. Sample Stability (Freeze/Thaw Cycles)

Ten samples of each human serum and plasma types were aliquoted and measured fresh (reference value) and after one freeze/thaw cycle with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay.

Measurements were performed in three-fold determination on one cobas e 601 analyzer, and recovery was calculated as percent of the reference value or as deviation in $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# 5.15.2. Study 2. Sample Stability (at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ )

Ten samples of each human serum and plasma types were aliquoted and measured fresh (reference value) and after storage for up to 13 months at $- 2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay.

Measurement were performed in three-fold determination on one cobas e 601 analyzer, and recovery was calculated as percent of the reference value or as deviation in $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# 5.15.3. Study 3. Sample Stability (at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ )

Ten samples of each human serum and plasma types were aliquoted and measured fresh (reference value) and after storage for up to 72 hours at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay.

Measurement were performed in three-fold determination on one cobas e 601 analyzer, and recovery was calculated as percent of the reference value or as a deviation in $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# 5.15.4. Study 4. Sample Stability (at $1 5 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ )

Ten samples of each human serum and plasma types were aliquoted and measured fresh (reference value) and after storage for up to 48 hours at $1 5 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay.

Measurement were performed in three-fold determination on one cobas e 601 analyzer, and recovery was calculated as percent of the reference value or as a deviation in $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# 5.16. Calibration Stability

To test calibration stability, two studies were executed.

# 5.16.1. Study 1. Calibration (Lot) Stability

Calibration of an Elecsys BRAHMS PCT reagent lot is recommended every 4 weeks. During that time period, fresh reagent kits of the same lot can be used in conjunction with the calibration curve established at Day 0 for that reagent kit lot.

The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was calibrated with a fresh reagent kit on Day 0 using one Elecsys 2010 analyzer. After 4, 8, and 12 weeks, a new reagent kit of the same lot was used, with recovery of samples being determined using the calibration curve established on Day 0 for that reagent kit lot.

Five human serum (HS) samples and two controls were tested in duplicate. Recovery compared to the reference value was calculated as either deviation (i $\mathrm { n } \mathrm { n g / m L ) }$ .

# 5.16.2. Study 2. Calibration (On Board) Stability

A fresh Elecsys BRAHMS PCT test kit was placed on an Elecsys 2010 analyzer and calibrated. Five native human serum (HS) sample pools and two control samples were tested with the fresh reagent kit; each sample was tested with 2-fold determination. On day 7 and day 28 the same samples were determined with the same reagent kit (kept on board of the instruments) using the calibration curve of day 0 and day 21 respectively. Each sample was tested with 2-fold determination.

# 5.16. Calibrator Stability

The PCT CalSet was evaluated for value assignment and stability; three studies were executed.

# 5.17.1. Calibrator Value Assignment

Value assignment tested was conducted and passed pre-defined acceptance criteria. The target values for the two levels of the PCT Calset are chosen to obtain the best fit with the Master Calibration Curve, together with the Rodbard curve parameters encoded in the reagent barcode. For each Elecsys PCT CalSet lot manufactured, the calibrators are run in duplicate on at least six cobas e 411 analyzers and least three cobas e 601/cobas e 602/MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 analyzers with all Elecsys BRAHMS PCT reagent lots available. The assigned value of each calibrator is defined as the mean value obtained over at least six runs on at least three analyzers of the respective calibrator.

Measurement values for PreciControl PCT (Levels 1 and 2), a single-analyte control recommended for use to monitor accuracy and precision of the PCT analyte, are read from the calibration curves generated. The pre-defined acceptance criteria for PreciControl PCT have to be met to release the Assigned Values for the PCT CalSet.

5.17.2. Study 1. Calibrator Stability (Post Reconstitution at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ )

Reconstituted calibrators were stored for 3 months at $- 2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .

The freshly reconstituted calibrators, and the reconstituted calibrators stored for 3 months at - $2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , were measured in one run on one Elecsys 2010 analyzer.

Recoveries of the stressed calibrators versus the freshly reconstituted calibrators were calculated.

5.17.3. Study 2. Calibrator Stability (Post Reconstitution at $2 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ )

Reconstituted calibrators were stored for 5 hours at $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

The freshly reconstituted calibrators, and the reconstituted calibrators stored for 5 hours at 20– $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , were measured in one run on one Elecsys 2010.

Recoveries of the stressed calibrators versus the freshly reconstituted calibrators were calculated.

5.17.4. Study 3. Calibrator Stability (Real-Time Shelf Life part of Assay Testing)

In the real-time, shelf-life stability study, the PCT CalSet was stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The stored calibrator was tested at time point 0 (at manufacture), then again at specified intervals over the shelf life of the device (up to the planned shelf life plus one month).

# 5.18. PreciControl PCT

PreciControl PCT was evaluated for value assignment and stability; three studies were executed.

# 5.18.1. PreciControl Value Assignment

The PreciControl PCT assigned values are determined with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay. A human serum sample panel (Master Calibrators) covering the entire measuring range is available, which is traceable to the PCT.

The assigned values for PreciControl PCT are read from the master calibration curve. Values are assigned for each lot of PreciControl PCT in combination with each Elecsys PCT assay reagent lot available. The controls are run in duplicate on at least six analyzers of the master analyzer platform. The assigned value of each control level is defined as the median value obtained over at least six determinations of the respective control level. For additional analyzer platforms, the same value assignment procedure is performed. The assigned values obtained on the additional analyzer are compared to those obtained on the master platform.

5.18.2. Study 1. PreciControl Stability (Post Reconstitution at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ )

Reconstituted calibrators were stored for 3 months at $- 2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .

The freshly reconstituted calibrators, and the reconstituted calibrators stored for 3 months at $- 2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , were measured in one run on one Elecsys 2010 analyzer.   
Recovery of the stressed PreciControl PCT compared to the freshly reconstituted PreciControl PCT was calculated.

5.18.3. Study 2. PreciControl Stability (Post Reconstitution at $2 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ )

Reconstituted controls were stored for 5 hours at $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

The freshly reconstituted controls, and the reconstituted controls stored for 5 hours at $2 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , were measured in one run on one Elecsys 2010.

Recoveries of the stressed controls versus the freshly reconstituted controls.

5.18.4. Study 3. PreciControl Stability (Real-Time Shelf Life part of Assay Testing)

In the real-time, shelf-PCT samples were tested at time point 0 (at manufacture), then again at specified intervals over the shelf life of the device (up to the planned shelf life plus one month).

# 5.19. PCT CalCheck 5 Stability

PCT CalCheck 5 was evaluated for value assignment and stability; two studies were executed.

# 5.19.1. PCT CalCheck 5 Value Assignment

Value assignment testing was conducted and passed pre-defined acceptance criteria. For each Elecsys BRAHMS PCT CalCheck 5 lot manufactured, each CalCheck is run in duplicate on at least six analyzers of the master analyzer platform. The assigned valued of each CalCheck level is defined as the mean value obtained over at least six determinations (duplicate runs on at least three analyzers) of the respective CalCheck level.

The CalCheck assigned range is calculated as $\pm 3 0 \%$ of the assigned value for levels two through five. The label states that each laboratory should establish appropriate acceptance criteria when using this product for its intended use.

The same value assignment procedure is performed on the cobas e 601 analyzer. The assigned values obtained are compared to those obtained on the cobas e 411 analyzer. The mean value obtained on the additional analyzer must be within $10 \%$ of the master platform assigned value. After this acceptance criterion is met, the assigned values from the master platform are deemed valid for the Elecsys 2010, MODULAR ANALYTICS E170, cobas e 411, cobas e 601, and cobas e 602 analyzers.

# 5.19.2. Study 1. PCT CalCheck 5 Accelerated and Open Vial Stability

One PCT CalCheck 5 lot was evaluated, in duplicate, on one cobas e 411 analyzer. A set of PCT CalCheck 5 was stored for 3 weeks at $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . After the three week period the test material was reconstituted and stored for 3 hours at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (in an open vial).

The reference material used was a freshly reconstituted set of PCT CalCheck 5. Recovery of the stressed PCT CalCheck 5 compared to the freshly reconstituted PCT CalCheck 5 was calculated.

5.19.3. Study 2. PCT CalCheck 5 Stability (Real-Time Shelf Life)

In the real-time shelf-life stability study (which is ongoing), the PCT CalCheck 5 will be stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The stored PCT CalCheck 5 will be tested at time point 0 (at manufacture), then again at specified intervals over the shelf life of the device (up to the planned shelf life plus one month).

Samples tested in duplicate include five CalCheck levels.

# 5.19.4. Study 3. PCT CalCheck $5 ^ { \star }$ Stability (Real-Time Shelf Life)

In another real-time shelf-life stability study, a PCT CalCheck 5 lot (\*with slightly different level 2 and 3 concentrations) was stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 37 months. The stored PCT CalCheck 5 was tested at time point 0 (at manufacture), then again at specified internals up to 37 months.

Samples tested in duplicate include five CalCheck levels.

# 6.2 Clinical Performance

The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was evaluated for the prediction of cumulative 28-day all-cause mortality in a prospective clinical trial18 study of 858 adult patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock admitted to ICU care in which PCT levels were measured on Days 0, 1, and 4 across 13 investigational sites in the US. The per protocol analysis population (598 subjects) was comprised of $44 \%$ female and $56 \%$ male patients with a mean age of 64 years. About half of the patients had severe sepsis $( 5 1 \% )$ versus septic shock $(49 \% )$ . Infections were mainly community acquired $( 9 1 \% )$ .

The binary test result $( \Delta \mathrm { P C T } > 8 0 \%$ or $\leq 8 0 \%$ ) was significantly associated with 28-day cumulative mortality (vital status on day 28) (Two-sided Fisher’s Exact Test p-value $= 0 . 0 0 2 )$ . Adjusted for ICU vs. non-ICU patient subgroups (based on hospital location at day 4 after initial diagnosis), the association remained significant (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Test p-value $= 0 . 0 2 0 $ ). In each binary $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ subgroup, the 28-day cumulative mortality rate was stratified by need to continue ICU care on day 4 and/or the selection of Day 0 vs. Day 1 as the baseline measurement day for the ΔPCT calculation. The data are as follows:

b) Prognostic accuracy refers to how accurate the ΔPC $\Gamma ( > 8 0 \% \lor \bar { \mathbf { S } } . \leq 8 0 \% )$ can predict mortality risk using 28-day mortality as the clinical reference. Kaplan Meier survival curves show that patients with a positive $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ result $( \leq 8 0 \% )$ had a clearly lower survival probability from study Day 4 till the end of follow up time compared to ΔPCT negative $( > 8 0 \% )$ patients.

Additional stratification of patients based on absolute initial PCT levels $( > \mathrm { o r } \leq 2 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / L } )$ at Day 0 (or Day 1) revealed subgroups with particularly reduced or elevated mortality risk considering their hospital disposition on Day 4. Mortality rates and prognostic performance are given for the following subgroups in the table below:

1. Patients with $\operatorname { P C T } \leq 2 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / L }$ at Day 0 (or Day 1) receiving ICU care on Day 4.   
2. Patients with $\mathrm { P C T } > 2 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / L }$ at Day 0 (or Day 1) receiving ICU care on Day 4.   
3. Patients with $\operatorname { P C T } \leq 2 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / L }$ at Day 0 (or Day 1) without ICU care on Day 4.   
4. Patients with $\mathrm { P C T } > 2 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / L }$ at Day 0 (or Day 1) without ICU care on Day 4.

c) Normality approximation of within-imputation variance not valid, therefore the estimate corresponds to within-imputation variation based on exact confidence intervals [Clopper & Pearson, 1934] \* Prognostic accuracy refers to how accurate the ΔPCT (≤ $80 \%$ vs. $\leq 8 0 \%$ ) can predict mortality risk. Kaplan-Meier Plots are depicted below to illustrate the time-to-event structure in the extended patient subgroups according to hospital location on Day 4 and initial PCT level.

![](images/2dc39229b5064cdd1070754f301ef81808998d59f5317f00b96487e0e594ee6b.jpg)

Time-to-event analysis evidently reveals that patients in the ICU or with an initial PCT value $> 2 . 0 ~ \mu \varrho / \mathrm { L }$ had a lower survival probability from study Day 4 until the end of follow up time (28 days) when the $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ test result was positive compared to $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ negative patients as illustrated by the Kaplan-Meier curves above (patient subgroups according to hospital location on Day 4 and initial PCT level).

A generally lower mortality rate was observed in the non-ICU subgroup. The mortality rates for $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ positive vs. ΔPCT negative patient subgroups were:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Patients with PCT ≤ 2.0 µg/L at Day 0 receiving ICU care on Day 4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10.4 % vs. 24.9 %</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Patients with PCT &gt; 2.0 µg/L at Day 0 receiving ICU care on Day 4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>23.6 % vs. 33.2 %</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Patients with PCT ≤ 2.0 µg/L at Day 0 without ICU care on Day 4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.6 % vs. 8.3 %</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Patients with PCT &gt; 2.0 µg/L at Day 0 without ICU care on Day 4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.6 % vs. 17.5 %</td></tr></table>

Based on relative mortality ratios a decrease by more than $80 \%$ from Day 0 (or Day 1) to Day 4 constitutes a lower risk for mortality within 28 days compared to smaller declines in each subgroup. For the prediction of absolute mortality risks ICU disposition at Day 4 and initial PCT concentrations should be considered:

1. An initial PCT level $\leq 2 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / L }$ on Day 0 followed by a PCT decline of more than $80 \%$ until Day 4 indicates an almost 2-fold lower mortality $( 1 0 . 4 \% )$ for patients with severe sepsis or septic shock who are still in the ICU by Day 4 compared to those patients with an initial PCT $\mathrm { l e v e l } > 2 . 0 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { L } ( 2 3 . 6 \% ) .$ . Regardless of the initial PCT level, patients in the ICU on Day 4 that do not decline by more than $80 \%$ in PCT plasma concentration from Day 0 to Day 4 have an even higher mortality risk of $2 4 . 9 \substack { - 3 3 . 2 \% }$ .

2. An initial PCT level $> 2 . 0 \mu \mathrm { g / L }$ that does not decline by more than $80 \%$ until Day 4 signals that such patients remain at high mortality risk $( 1 7 . 5 \% )$ even when they are no longer receiving ICU care on Day 4. Mortality was otherwise observed between 5.6 to $8 . 3 \%$ for patients discharged from the ICU by Day 4.

In conclusion, hazard ratios for binary $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ for both subgroups enrolled show an increase in mortality with $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ . The mortality risk stratification using $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ is valid when calculated from the day severe sepsis or septic shock is first diagnosed (Day 0) or the day thereafter (Day 1) and compared to the fourth day (Day 4) after diagnosis. The $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ at Day 4 combined with the patient’s clinical course provides important information for the 28-day all-cause mortality risk prediction after a diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock.

The prognostic value of $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ was quantified by pooled p values of Wald statistics (Rubin’s rule). The hazard ratio of binary $\Delta \mathrm { P C T } 4 . 0$ in the univariate model is 1.80 $( \mathbf { p } = 0 . 0 1 1 )$ ) for patients of the Per-Protocol population and similarly of the Intention to diagnose group (1.81; $\mathfrak { p } = 0 . 0 0 8 )$ . That means the risk of death is increased 1.8-fold if an individual has a positive test result for ΔPCT.

ΔPCT from Day 0 (or Day 1) to Day 4 remains a prognostic parameter for the risk of cumulative 28-day mortality in patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock even when hazard ratios are adjusted for other mortality predictors in multivariate models. The relative mortality risk estimates for $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ and selected predictors are given below with $9 5 \ \%$ confidence intervals. For continuous predictors, the hazard ratio (HR) was calculated for one standard deviation (SD) change in the predictor. For binary predictors, the risk estimate compares the hazards for the two binary results.

Hazard ratios for ∆PCT were calculated for each group as univariate and when applying certain covariates and are tabulated below.

g) In the analysis, missing values for predictors were multiple imputed assuming they were Missing at Random (MAR), with the multiple imputations combined according to Rubin’s rules (Rubin D.B.,Wiley New York 1987; Multiple Imputation for Nonresponse in Surveys). h) The models also included the following predictors (HR results not shown): Antibiotic adequacy, Sepsis severity, Biological infection type, Clinical infection type, Positive blood culture, PCT on Day 0, Gender. The change of PCT over time can also be described by the ratio of PCT values from Day 4 and Day 0 (or Day 1):

$$
P C T _ { r a t i o } = \frac { P C T _ { D a y 4 } } { P C T _ { D a y 0 ( o r D a y 1 ) } }
$$

A decline of $\Delta \mathrm { P C T } = 8 0 \%$ translates into a PCT ratio of 0.2. The PCT ratio has values larger than 0.2 when the $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ decline is below $80 \%$ which is associated with a higher risk for cumulative 28- day all-cause mortality in patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock. Likewise, a PCT ratio below 0.2 indicates a lower risk for mortality within 28 days. On a continuous scale, the relative mortality risk for patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock is higher the larger the PCT ratio. The following tables list the hazard ratios for an increase by the factor 2 in PCT ratio, i.e. the relative increase in mortality risk for a patient with any given PCT ratio compared to a patient with a 2-fold lower PCT ratio. For comparison, selected predictors are indicated with corresponding equivalents in standard deviation. For the patient location at Day 4, the risk estimate compares the hazards for patients with vs. without ICU care on Day 4.

Accordingly, the reported ∆PCT hazard ratios refer to an increase of ∆PCT by a factor of 2. For comparability, hazard ratios of the other continuous predictors were estimated for the same fractional SDs, i.e. 0.52 or 0.69, respectively.
