Indications for Use (Describe)

The Xpert® Carba-R Assay, performed on the GeneXpert® Instrument Systems, is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test designed for the detection and differentiation of the blaKPC, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaOXA-48, and blaIMP gene sequences associated with carbapenem-non-susceptibility. The test utilizes automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

The Xpert Carba-R Assay is intended as an aid to infection control in the detection of carbapenem-non- susceptible bacteria that colonize patients in healthcare settings. The Xpert Carba-R Assay is not intended to guide or monitor treatment for carbapenemnon-susceptible bacterial infections. A negative Xpert Carba-R Assay result does not preclude the presence of other resistance mechanisms.

The Xpert Carba-R Assay is for use with the following sample types:

Rectal Swab Specimens

The assay is performed on rectal swab specimens from patients at risk for intestinal colonization with carbapenem-non-susceptible bacteria. Concomitant cultures are necessary to recover organisms for epidemiological typing, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and for further confirmatory bacterial identification.

Pure Colonies

The assay is performed on carbapenem-non-susceptible pure colonies of Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, when grown on blood agar or MacConkey agar. For testing pure colonies, the Xpert Carba-R Assay should be used in conjunction with other laboratory tests including phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

Assay: [510(k) #K152614]

# Device Description:

The Xpert Carba-R Assay is an automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in vitro diagnostic test for qualitative detection of the blaKPC, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaOXA-48, and blaIMP gene sequences from rectal swab specimens. The Xpert Carba-R Assay is intended as an aid for infection control for monitoring the spread of carbapenem-nonsusceptible organisms in healthcare settings.

The Xpert Carba-R Assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert® Instrument Systems (GeneXpert Dx, GeneXpert Infinity-48, GeneXpert Infinity-48s, and GeneXpert Infinity80 systems). The GeneXpert Instrument System platform automates sample preparation, amplification and real-time detection.

The GeneXpert Instrument Systems require the use of single-use, disposable cartridges (the Xpert Carba-R cartridges) that hold the PCR reagents and host the PCR process. Because the cartridges are self-contained and specimens never come into contact with working parts of the instrument modules, cross-contamination between samples is minimized.

The Xpert Carba-R Assay cartridges contain reagents for the detection of blaKPC, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaOXA-48, and blaIMP gene sequences. A Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) are controls utilized by the GeneXpert Instrument System platform. The SPC is present to control for adequate processing of the target bacteria and to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the real-time PCR reaction to reduce the possibility of false negative results. The PCC verifies reagent rehydration, real-time PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability.

The single-use, multi-chambered fluidic cartridges are designed to complete sample preparation and real-time PCR for the detection of the blaKPC, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaOXA-48, and blaIMP gene sequences from rectal swab specimens in approximately 50 minutes. The GeneXpert Instrument Systems, comprised of the GeneXpert Dx Systems and the GeneXpert Infinity Systems, have 1 to 80 randomly accessible modules, depending upon the instrument, that are each capable of performing separate sample processing and realtime PCR and RT- PCR tests. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids (i.e., the syringe drive activates the plunger that works in concert with the rotary valve in the cartridge to move fluids between chambers), an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or spores, and a proprietary I-CORE® thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and RT-PCR and detection.

Rectal swab specimens are placed into a sample reagent. The sample is transferred to the sample chamber of the disposable fluidic cartridge (the Xpert Carba-R cartridge). The user initiates a test from the system user interface and places the cartridge into the GeneXpert instrument platform, which performs hands-off real-time, multiplex PCR for detection of the blaKPC, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaOXA-48, and blaIMP gene sequences. The results are automatically generated at the end of the process in a report that can be viewed and printed.

# Device Intended Use:

The Xpert® Carba-R Assay, performed on the GeneXpert® Instrument Systems, is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test designed for the detection and differentiation of the blaKPC, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaOXA-48, and $b l a _ { \mathrm { I M P } }$ gene sequences associated with carbapenem-non-susceptibility. The test utilizes automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

The Xpert Carba-R Assay is intended as an aid to infection control in the detection of carbapenem-non-susceptible bacteria that colonize patients in healthcare settings. The Xpert Carba-R Assay is not intended to guide or monitor treatment for carbapenem-nonsusceptible bacterial infections. A negative Xpert Carba-R Assay result does not preclude the presence of other resistance mechanisms.

The Xpert Carba R-Assay is for use with the following sample types:

Rectal Swab Specimens

The assay is performed on rectal swab specimens from patients at risk for intestinal colonization with carbapenem-non-susceptible bacteria. Concomitant cultures are necessary to recover organisms for epidemiological typing, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and for further confirmatory bacterial identification.

Pure Colonies

The assay is performed on carbapenem-non-susceptible pure colonies of Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, when grown on blood agar or MacConkey agar. For testing pure colonies, the Xpert Carba-R Assay should be used in conjunction with other laboratory tests including phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

# Substantial Equivalence:

The Cepheid Xpert Carba-R Assay is substantially equivalent to the Xpert® Carba-R Assay, 510(k) #K152614. Both assays utilize the same GeneXpert cartridge and detect target gene sequences (blaKPC, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaOXA-48, and blaIMP) using real-time PCR amplification and fluorogenic target-specific hybridization detection. The performance of the Xpert Carba-R Assay for an expanded indication was determined in a multi-site clinical study in which the performance of the Xpert Carba-R Assay was evaluated relative to culture and reference DNA sequence analysis. The results of the study demonstrated that the performance of the Xpert Carba-R Assay is substantially equivalent to the predicate device. Please refer to K152614 for information on the performance of the Xpert Carba-R Assay with pure colonies of carbapenem nonsusceptible Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The Xpert Carba-R Assay has the same general intended use as the predicate device and has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device. The differences between the Xpert Carba-R Assay and the predicate device do not raise questions of safety and effectiveness. The clinical study demonstrates that the Xpert Carba-R Assay is acceptable for its intended use with inexperienced laboratory users and is substantially equivalent to the predicate device described above.

# Non-Clinical Studies:

# Analytical Sensitivity (Limit of Detection)

The analytical sensitivity or Limit of Detection (LoD) of the Xpert Carba-R Assay was assessed using carbapenemase-producing organisms seeded into pooled negative human rectal swab matrix. The LoD was determined for two carbapenemase-producing bacteria for each gene analyte, i.e., the genes encoding KPC, NDM, VIM, OXA-48, and IMP. Bacteria were titered by plate counts and spiked onto clean swabs. Swabs were placed into pooled negative rectal swab matrix and replicates of 20 were evaluated at a minimum of five different concentrations over four days. The LoD for each of the ten carbapenemaseproducing organisms was estimated by probit analysis. The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration of target cells (CFU/swab) that can be reproducibly distinguished from negative samples with $9 5 \%$ confidence. The study was performed with two different lots of Xpert Carba-R reagents and the claimed LoD is the higher of the two determinations. The estimated LoDs were verified by preparing and testing 10 replicates from two independent dilutions of each bacterium at each estimated LoD.

The claimed LoD for each pair of carbapenemase-producing organism in rectal swab matrix are shown in Table 5-2.

# Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)

The analytical reactivity of the Xpert Carba-R Assay with rectal swab matrix was evaluated by testing a panel of 72 samples. This panel consisted of 11 blaKPC (KPC), 11 blaVIM (VIM), 13 blaNDM (NDM), 8 blaOXA-48 (OXA-48), 5 blaNDM/blaOXA-181 (NDM/OXA-181), 6 blaOXA181(OXA-181), 17 blaIMP (IMP), and one $b l a _ { \mathrm { K P C } } / b l a _ { \mathrm { V I M } }$ (KPC/VIM) well-characterized

bacterial strains. The strains tested in rectal swab matrix and their test concentrations are presented in Table 5-3.

For testing in rectal swab matrix, organisms were seeded into pooled negative rectal swab matrix. All bacterial strains were tested in triplicate at approximately $3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD for each specimen type. Xpert Carba-R Assay target genes were detected in 69 of 72 carbapenemase-producing bacterial strains although IMP-4 was detected only using a higher concentration (Table 5-3). Xpert Carba-R Assay target DNA sequences were not detected in three bacterial strains as shown in Table 5-3. In one of the three bacterial strains, the IMP-13 gene was not detected by the assay, although it was predicted to be detected by in silico analysis. In two of the other three bacterial strains, the IMP-7 and IMP14 genes were not predicted to be detected by in silico analysis and were not detected by the assay. See Limitations in the package insert.

The variants detected, and predictions for detecting other subtypes of each resistance gene based on in silico analysis, are presented in Table 5-4.

# Analytical Specificity (Cross-reactivity)

The analytical specificity of the Xpert Carba-R Assay was evaluated for bacterial isolates, organisms seeded into rectal swab matrix. For all three specimen types, a panel of 62 wellcharacterized bacterial strains of carbapenem-susceptible bacteria or bacteria with carbapenem non-susceptibility due to genes or mechanisms other than the Xpert Carba-R target genes (Table 5-5 and Table 5-6) and 24 commensal bacterial strains and other enteric microorganisms were also evaluated in the study (Table 5-7). Human cells were also tested in rectal swab matrix (Table 5-8). Resistance mechanisms were determined by individual PCR assays, DNA sequence analysis, or Check-Points array version CT102.

For rectal swab matrix samples, 62 strains were tested at concentrations $> 1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ with the exception of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius that was tested at $5 \mathrm { \times 1 0 ^ { 5 } C F U / m L }$ . Viruses were tested at $> \mathrm { \hat { l } \ x 1 0 ^ { 5 } T C I D _ { 5 0 } / m L }$ or greater than $2 . 5 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ RNA copies/mL. A bladder cell line (human genomic DNA) was tested at $\mathrm { 1 ~ x ~ 1 0 ^ { 5 } ~ c e l l s / m L }$ . Organisms were diluted into pooled negative rectal swab matrix and tested in triplicate. None of the 94 potentially cross-reactive organisms and nucleic acids tested was detected with the Xpert Carba-R Assay.

The Xpert Carba-R Assay did not cross react with any of the organisms tested (Table 5-6, Table 5-7, and Table 5-8). The analytical specificity of the assay was $100 \%$ .

# Competitive Interference

A competitive interference study was performed to test whether a high titer of one or more carbapenemase-producing organisms would interfere with the detection of a second target carbapenemase-producing organism that was present at a low titer. High titered samples were formulated at concentrations of $5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ CFU/swab and low titered targets were formulated at approximately $2 \mathbf { x }$ LoD for the respective strain in rectal swab matrix. One carbapenemase-producing bacterial strain for each gene analyte, i.e., the genes encoding

KPC, NDM, VIM, OXA-48, and IMP, was used in this study. Each carbapenemaseproducing bacterial strain type was tested at low titers in conjunction with a high titer of each of the other one or two carbapenemase-producing bacterial strain types (Table 5-9). Samples were tested in replicates of eight. An inhibitory effect was observed for three of the five targets (IMP, VIM, and OXA-48) when a low concentration of each target was present in combination with a high concentration of one or two other targets for samples tested in rectal swab matrix. The three targets (IMP, VIM, and OXA-48) were tested at a higher concentration (4x LoD) in combination with a high concentration of one of two other targets for samples in rectal swab matrix. No inhibitory effect was observed for the three targets (IMP, VIM and OXA-48) at 4x LoD in the presence of clinically relevant co-infections for the Xpert Carba-R Assay. The competitive inhibitory effect on the Carba-R targets (IMP, VIM and OXA-48) is addressed in Section 15, Limitations in the package insert.

# Potentially Interfering Substances

The performance of the Xpert Carba-R Assay was evaluated with 24 potentially interfering substances that may be present in rectal swab specimens. Potentially interfering substances (IS) solutions were prepared and tested at concentrations specified in Table 5-10. Positive and negative samples were included in this study. Positive samples consisted of a mix of five carbapenemase-producing organisms harboring KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP-1 and OXA-48 gene sequences seeded into pooled negative rectal swab matrix at approximately 3x LoD. Eight replicate positive samples were tested per substance. Negative samples consisted of pooled negative rectal swab matrix not seeded with carbapenemase-producing organisms. Eight replicate negative samples were tested per substance to determine the effect on the

performance of the sample processing control (SPC). Controls consisted of positive and negative samples with no interfering substances added. The effect of each potentially interfering substance on positive and negative replicates was evaluated by comparing target cycle threshold $\mathrm { ( C t ) }$ values generated in the presence of the substance to Ct values from controls lacking the substance. The positive and negative replicate samples for 22 potentially interfering substances were correctly identified using the Xpert Carba-R Assay. Interference with the Xpert Carba-R Assay may be observed with barium sulfate at $> 0 . 1 \%$ w/v and Pepto-Bismol at $> 0 . 0 1 \%$ w/v in tests with rectal swab matrix samples. See Limitations in the package insert. Rectal swab matrix samples, positive for a mix of five carbapenemase-producing organisms harboring KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP-1 and OXA-48 gene sequences that were tested with fecal fat at $0 . 2 5 \%$ w/v, did not yield any false negative results, however, delayed cycle threshold values were observed for the VIM target. This potential interference from the presence of $0 . 2 5 \%$ w/v fecal fat is provided in the Limitations section of the package insert.

# Carry-Over Contamination

A study was conducted to demonstrate that single-use, self-contained GeneXpert cartridges prevent carry-over contamination in negative samples run following very high positive samples. The study consisted of a negative sample processed in the same GeneXpert module immediately following a very high positive sample. The high positive sample is composed of inactivated $E$ . coli cells containing a plasmid with an insert consisting of a synthetic oligonucleotide of the amplicon sequences from the five Xpert Carba-R target analyte genes (KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP and OXA-48 targets). Positive cells were diluted in pooled negative rectal swab matrix to a concentration of $1 \mathrm { \Delta x 1 0 ^ { 6 } C F U / m L }$ . The testing scheme was repeated 25 times on two GeneXpert modules for a total of 102 tests (25 high positive samples per module and 26 negative samples per module) for the rectal swab matrix. All 50 positive samples correctly reported all Xpert Carba-R targets as DETECTED. All 52 negative samples correctly reported all Xpert Carba-R targets as NOT DETECTED.

# Clinical Performance

Performance characteristics of the Xpert Carba-R Assay with rectal swab specimens were determined in a multi-site investigational study. The positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) of the Xpert Carba-R Assay was evaluated relative to a reference method of culture (MacConkey enrichment broth) and PCR/bi-directional DNA sequence analysis.

Five geographically diverse sites (three across the United States and two in Europe) prospectively collected paired rectal swab specimens from subjects who were hospitalized or in a long-term care facility. Highly soiled rectal swab specimens, were excluded from the study. Due to low prevalence of each of the Xpert Carba-R Assay target genes in the absence of an outbreak, contrived specimens were also included in the study.

One rectal swab of the pair was used for Xpert Carba-R Assay testing. The second rectal swab was inoculated into MacConkey enrichment broth and used for reference method testing. A reference culture laboratory determined the presence of carbapenem nonsusceptible organisms by culturing the MacConkey enrichment broth from each of the specimens. The MacConkey enrichment broth was screened for the presence of carbapenem-non-susceptible organisms initially by plating the broth on MacConkey agar plates with a meropenem disk. For specimens that exhibited growth of gramnegative bacteria around the meropenem disk, confirmation of carbapenem nonsusceptibility was determined on isolated colonies by using the disk diffusion method (per CLSI document M02) as well as CLSI document M100. DNA extracted from the carbapenem non-susceptible isolates was purified, quantified, and amplified using primers specific to all 5 target genes; amplified regions included more bases than the regions amplified by the Xpert Carba-R Assay. The production of the appropriate size amplification product was confirmed on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).

If bands shown on the Bioanalyzer corresponded to the expected size of the amplicon from any of the five target genes detected by the Xpert Carba-R Assay, the amplicon for the isolate was sent to an independent laboratory for reference bi-directional sequencing analysis, which was validated for detection of the five targets in the Xpert Carba-R Assay. If no bands were shown on the Bioanalyzer for any of the five target genes, the isolate was not sent for sequence analysis and the reference method result was considered negative for the five target genes.

# Prospective Specimen Results Obtained with the Xpert Carba-R Assay in Comparison to the Reference Method

A total of 802 prospective rectal swab specimens were initially enrolled in this clinical study, of which 785 were eligible for inclusion. From the 785 eligible specimens, 755 specimens were included in the final dataset after exclusions based on protocol deviations (including 16 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia organisms that were excluded due to their intrinsic resistance to the carbapenems tested).

When tested with prospective rectal swab specimens, the Xpert Carba-R Assay demonstrated a PPA range from $6 0 . 0 \%$ to $100 \%$ for the four assay targets $( b l a _ { \mathrm { K P C } } ,$ , $b l a _ { \mathrm { N D M } }$ , blaVIM, and blaOXA-48) relative to the reference method (Table 5-11). The NPA for the $b l a _ { \mathrm { K P C } }$ , $b l a _ { \mathrm { N D M } }$ , blaVIM, blaOXA-48, and $b l a _ { \mathrm { I M P } }$ gene sequences ranged from $9 8 . 6 \% 9 9 . 9 \%$ relative to the reference method (Table 5-11).

For specimens with discordant results (the Xpert Carba-R Assay was positive for a target gene but a carbapenem-non-susceptible organism was not isolated by reference culture), discordant analysis was performed using bi-directional sequencing on DNA extracted directly from the MacConkey enrichment broth. Discrepant testing results are footnoted in Table 5-11.

# Contrived Specimen Results Obtained with the Xpert Carba-R Assay in Comparison to the Reference Method

A total of 432 contrived specimens prepared in rectal swab matrix were also tested as part of the clinical study.

In addition to Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii groups tested in the contrived study, 5 other non-Enterobacteriaceae strains were also evaluated: Pseudomonas stutzeri (1), Pseudomonas oryzihabitans (1), Pseudomonas putida (2), and Empedobacter brevis (1).

When tested with contrived specimens, the Xpert Carba-R Assay demonstrated a PPA range from $9 5 \%$ to $100 \%$ across the assay targets (blaKPC, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaOXA-48, and $b l a _ { \mathrm { I M P } } )$ .

# Reproducibility Study

Reproducibility of the Xpert Carba-R Assay was evaluated using two panels of 11 samples, prepared in pooled negative rectal swab matrix. Two operators at each of the three study sites tested one panel of 11 samples in replicates of four per day over six testing days (11 samples x 2 replicates x 2 times/day x 6 days x 2 operators x 3 sites). Three lots of Xpert Carba-R Assay cartridges were used at each of the 3 testing sites. The Xpert Carba-R Assay was performed according to the Xpert Carba-R Assay procedure. Results are summarized in Table 5-15.

The reproducibility of the Xpert Carba-R Assay was also evaluated in terms of the fluorescence signal expressed in $\mathrm { C t }$ values for each target detected. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) between-sites, between-lots, betweendays, between-operators, and within-assays for each panel member are presented in Table 5-16.
