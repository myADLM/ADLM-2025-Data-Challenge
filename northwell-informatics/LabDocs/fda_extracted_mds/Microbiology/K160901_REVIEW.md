# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The Xpert® Carba-R Assay, performed on the GeneXpert® Instrument Systems, is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test designed for the detection and differentiation of the blaKPC, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaOXA-48, and $b l a _ { \mathrm { I M P } }$ gene sequences associated with carbapenemnon-susceptibility. The test utilizes automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

The Xpert Carba-R Assay is intended as an aid to infection control in the detection of carbapenem-non-susceptible bacteria that colonize patients in healthcare settings. The Xpert Carba-R Assay is not intended to guide or monitor treatment for carbapenem-nonsusceptible bacterial infections. A negative Xpert Carba-R Assay result does not preclude the presence of other resistance mechanisms.

The Xpert Carba R-Assay is for use with the following sample types:

Rectal Swab Specimens   
The assay is performed on rectal swab specimens from patients at risk for intestinal colonization with carbapenem-non-susceptible bacteria. Concomitant cultures are necessary to recover organisms for epidemiological typing, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and for further confirmatory bacterial identification.

Pure Colonies

The assay is performed on carbapenem non-susceptible pure colonies of Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, when grown on blood agar or MacConkey agar. For testing pure colonies, the Xpert Carba-R Assay should be used in conjunction with other laboratory tests including phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

2. Indication(s) for use:

Same as the Intended Use.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

For prescription use only.

The Xpert Carba-R Assay detects blaKPC, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaOXA-48, and blaIMP gene sequences from rectal swab specimens and is not for bacterial identification or to report susceptibility status.

The detection of assay targets by the Xpert Carba-R Assay does not indicate the presence of viable organisms containing the resistance marker.

The Xpert Carba-R Assay is not a sub-typing tool and does not report variants of the blaKPC, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaOXA-48, and $b l a _ { \mathrm { I M P } }$ genes.

Detection of blaKPC, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaOXA-48, and/or blaIMP gene sequences does not indicate the presence of viable organisms with these markers in the specimen.

# 4. Special instrument requirements:

The Xpert Carba-R Assay uses PCR technology on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems, which extract, amplify, and detect the target DNA.

# I. Device Description:

The Xpert Carba-R Assay is an automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of the blaKPC, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaOXA-48, and $b l a _ { \mathrm { I N P } }$ gene sequences from rectal swab specimens. The Xpert Carba-R Assay is intended as an aid for infection control to monitor the spread of carbapenem-non-susceptible organisms in healthcare settings. The assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert Instrument Systems (GeneXpert Dx, GeneXpert Infinity-48, GeneXpert Infinity-48s, and GeneXpert Infinity-80 systems). The GeneXpert Instrument Systems utilize single-use, disposable cartridges (Xpert Carba-R cartridges) containing PCR reagents that allow for automated sample preparation, amplification, and real-time detection of gene targets in approximately 50 minutes. A Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) have been incorporated into the assay design to address key failure modes that could result in a false negative determination.

The GeneXpert Instrument Systems (GeneXpert Dx Systems and the GeneXpert Infinity Systems) have 1 to 80 randomly accessible modules, depending upon the instrument, that are each capable of performing separate sample processing and real-time PCR tests. Because the cartridges are self-contained and specimens never come into contact with working parts of the instrument modules, cross-contamination between samples is minimized.

# L. Test Principle:

The Xpert Carba-R Assay cartridges contain reagents for the detection of blaKPC, $b l a _ { \mathrm { N D M } }$ , blaVIM, blaOXA-48, and $b l a _ { \mathrm { I M P } }$ gene sequences from rectal swab specimens. Each swab is resuspended in $5 \mathrm { m l }$ of Sample Reagent. The sample is vortexed then transferred $( 1 . 7 \mathrm { m l } )$ to the sample chamber of a disposable Xpert Carba-R Assay cartridge. The user initiates a test from the system-user interface and places the cartridge into the GeneXpert instrument platform, which performs hands-off real-time, multiplex PCR for the detection of target sequences.

Results of the assay run are interpreted by the GeneXpert Instrument System software from measured fluorescent signals and embedded calculation algorithms. The results are automatically generated at the end of the process in a report that can be viewed and printed. Basic users can see test results reported as “red” highlighted for DETECTED results and “green” highlighted for NOT DETECTED results. Additional results that can be reported include: INVALID, ERROR, and NO RESULT.

# Interpretation of Results

The Xpert Carba-R Assay provides test results for the IMP, VIM, NDM, KPC, and OXA-48 target DNA sequences. A Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) have been designed for the assay as internal controls to enable the GeneXpert Instrument System to detect specific failure modes related to assay performance. The PCC is considered to PASS if the fluorescence generated meets the validated acceptance criteria. If the PCC fails for any of the IMP, VIM, NDM, KPC, and OXA-48 targets, or SPC target, a probe check error is reported and the test will not continue. The assay also reports if the test has an INVALID, ERROR or NO RESULT. Under these conditions, the test will need to be repeated using a new sample, a new cartridge, and/or new reagents. Retest procedures are described in the Xpert Carba-R package insert. An interpretation table for test results is shown in Table 1.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# 1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The reproducibility of the Xpert Carba-R Assay was established in a multi-center study. An 11-member panel was tested that included: 1) two different organisms for each of the five resistance genes detected by the Xpert Carba-R Assay and 2) one negative sample for all five gene targets. Each organism was spiked into a pooled negative rectal matrix at low positive $\left( \sim \mathrm { l x } \ \mathrm { L o D } \right)$ and moderate positive levels (2-3x LoD). To measure site-to-site reproducibility, the 11-member panel was tested in replicates of four each day at three (3) sites over a six day testing period with two operators per site. Three lots of Xpert Carba-R Assay cartridges were used at each testing site. A total of 1584 samples suspended in rectal matrix were evaluated, where 144 replicates for each of the 11 different panel members were tested. In rectal matrix, $9 9 . 4 \%$ (1574/1584) of samples were successful and produced the expected result on the first attempt. Seven (7) ERROR cases, one (1) INVALID result, and two (2) NO RESULT outcomes were reported. All ten samples yielded valid results upon repeat testing. The results of the reproducibility study are summarized in Table 2 below.

a Results with non-zero Ct values out of 144.

At ${ \sim } 1 \mathbf { x }$ LoD, the expected target was not detected in some samples (See Table 2 above). The lowest $\%$ total agreement, $8 6 . 1 \%$ (124/144), was observed with the low positive IMP sample. All moderate positive samples ( $2 { - } 3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD) gave the expected result in rectal matrix. All negative samples were correctly identified as negative (144/144). A total of 76 control samples were run with only 1 INVALID reported; all remaining positive and negative controls gave the expected results. Agreement between sites, operators, and lots was evaluated using Fisher’s Exact test. The data presented in Table 2 and Table 3 demonstrated an acceptable reproducibility for the Xpert Carba-R Assay on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems.

# External Controls

Commercially-available external controls can also be run in accordance with local, state, and federal accrediting organizations, as applicable. For each day of the study, an external negative control and two types of experimental positive controls were tested. One external positive control consisted of $E$ . coli cells containing a plasmid with an insert carrying amplicon sequences from all five Xpert Carba-R target analyte genes (Multivalent External Positive Control). The second external positive control consisted of individual carbapenemase-producing bacteria, each harboring only one of the Xpert Carba-R target carbapenemase genes. On each testing day, one negative control, the five-gene construct positive control, and two of five individual bacterial controls were tested. Of the 970 external control samples run, $9 9 . 2 \%$ (962/970) gave a valid result on the first attempt. Re-testing of the eight indeterminate controls gave the expected results.

External controls include the following bacteria harboring target genes:

Multivalent External Positive Control—External positive control (inactivated Escherichia coli carrying plasmid with KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP, and OXA-48 gene sequences)

Individual Positive Controls • K. pneumoniae KPC (ATCC BAA-1705) K. pneumoniae NDM (ATCC BAA-2146) K. pneumoniae VIM (NCTC 13439) K. pneumoniae OXA-48 (NCTC 13442) Escherichia coli IMP (NCTC 13476)

External Negative Control—Inactivated E. coli containing a plasmid with no resistance gene inserted.

# Internal Control (IC) Reaction Analysis

Internal controls enable the system to detect specific failure modes that could potentially result in an incorrect test result. Each Xpert Carba-R Assay includes a Sample Processing Control (SPC) and Probe Check Control (PCC) pre-loaded in the cartridge and provided with the assay.

# Sample Processing Control (SPC)

The SPC contains Bacillus globigii that is included in each cartridge to verify adequate processing of the sample. The SPC verifies that lysis of bacteria has occurred if the organisms are present and verifies the effectiveness of each sample preparation step—reaction tube filling, reaction components are present and functioning, and monitoring for the presence of potential inhibitor(s) in the PCR assay. Test results are reported as INVALID if the SPC fails to meet the valid minimum or maximum Ct specification.

# Probe Check control (PCC)

The PCC verifies reagent rehydration, real-time PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability. The PCC is considered to PASS if the fluorescence generated meets the validated acceptance criteria. If the PCC fails for any of the IMP, VIM, NDM, KPC, and OXA-48 targets or SPC target, a probe check error is reported and the test will not continue. If a probe check error is reported, the test may be repeated using a new sample, new cartridge, and new reagents.

# Stability Studies

A number of studies were conducted to establish the specimen stability of rectal swabs with the Xpert Carba-R Assay. These studies were performed to 1) establish the specimen stability for rectal swabs after specimen collection but prior to transfer to the Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent and 2) establish the specimen stability of rectal swabs eluted into Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent.

Stability of Rectal Swabs

In order to support a claim for the period of time that rectal swabs could be held before transfer to Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent and further processing, a mixture of five carbapenemase-producing bacteria (at approximately 3x LoD) was spiked onto negative matrix swabs to create known positive samples. Both positive and negative matrix swab samples were tested with the Xpert Carba-R Assay after being stored for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days at $2 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C }$ , $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $1 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and $2 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Four (4) replicate negative matrix swab samples and 14 replicate positive matrix swab samples were tested per time point and temperature condition. At the time of testing, swabs were then added to Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent. Eight replicate positive and negative matrix swab samples were tested at time $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { t = 0 } }$ .

Under the conditions of this study, positive and negative specimens at all storage conditions and temperatures tested were correctly identified using the Xpert Carba-R Assay. The data supports that rectal swabs are stable from the time of collection prior to transfer to Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent for up to 7 days when stored at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 2 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ before testing with the Xpert Carba-R Assay.

Stability after Rectal Swabs Resuspended in Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent To establish a claim for the stability of rectal swabs in the Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent, pooled negative rectal swab matrix was spiked at approximately $3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD with a mixture of five carbapenemase-producing bacteria that harbored targets of the Xpert Carba-R Assay. Aliquots of the positive swab matrix (with bacteria) in Sample Reagent were prepared to create positive samples. Negative samples in the study consisted of aliquots of negative pooled swab matrix in Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent. Positive and negative matrix samples were tested with the Xpert Carba-R Assay after being stored for 1, 3, 5 and 7 days at $2 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C }$ , $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $1 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , and $2 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Four (4) replicate negative matrix samples and 14 replicate positive matrix samples were tested per time point and temperature condition. Positive and negative matrix swab replicates were also tested at time $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { t } } = 0$ .

Under the conditions of this study, positive and negative samples at all storage conditions and temperatures tested were correctly reported using the Xpert CarbaR Assay. The data supports that sample material collected from rectal swabs are stable in Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent for up to 7 days when stored at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } -$ $2 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ prior to testing with the Xpert Carba-R Assay.

The study supports the following product claim specimen storage conditions prior to testing with the Xpert Carba-R Assay: 1) up to 5 days at $1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { - } 2 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for rectal swab specimens in transport tubes before transfer to Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent and 2) up to 5 days at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { - } 2 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for rectal swab specimens suspended in Xpert Carba-R Sample Reagent.

# d. Detection limit:

A study was conducted to determine the Limit of Detection (LoD) of the Xpert Carba-R Assay for carbapenemase-producing organisms harboring the blaKPC, $b l a _ { \mathrm { N D M } } , b l a _ { \mathrm { V I M } } , b l a _ { \mathrm { O X A - } 4 8 }$ , and $b l a _ { \mathrm { I M P } }$ gene sequence targets seeded into rectal swab background matrix. The LoD was defined as the lowest concentration (reported as cells/swab and cells/ml in Sample Reagent) of sample that can be reproducibly distinguished from negative samples with $9 5 \%$ confidence. Pre-screened negative rectal swab background matrix was used to confirm that the Limit of Blank (LoB) was zero. Two strains harboring each assay target were tested. Point estimates and two-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals for the analytical LoD (reported as CFU/swab) were determined using probit regression analysis. The LoD estimate was verified by preparing two independent dilutions of each bacterial culture to the point estimate LoD value. Twenty measurements (10 from each dilution) were tested, and the study was completed using at least two unique lots of Xpert Carba-R Assay reagents.

Of the 2,774 runs in the LoD study to estimate the LoD of various targets in rectal matrix (excluding the external controls), 32 runs $( 1 . 2 \% )$ provided indeterminate GeneXpert results (2 NO RESULT, 9 ERROR, 21 INVALID). All 32 runs were repeated yielding valid Carba-R results as expected. A total of 195 of 198 external control runs provided valid GeneXpert results.

All the data was collected with the GeneXpert Dx software version 4.4a on the GeneXpert Dx GX-IV and GX-XVI instruments and with the Infinity Xpertise software version 6.1 on the Infinity-80 instrument. Table 4 shows the estimated LoD results by probit analysis for the test panel.

a IMP-4 gene (Enterobacter aerogenes) was detected at much higher CFU/ml (5 x104 CFU/ml) than other IMP variants detected by the assay. $^ { b } I M P { - } 7$ and IMP-14 genes (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were not detected by the assay and were not predicted to be detected by in silico analysis (Limitations in package insert). $^ c I M P  – I 3$ gene (Klebsiella pneumoniae): Although predicted to be detected by in silico analysis, the IMP-13 gene was not detected by the assay (Limitation in package insert).

# e. Analytical specificity:

The analytical specificity of the Xpert Carba-R Assay was evaluated with a panel of 62 well-characterized carbapenem-susceptible bacteria or bacteria with carbapenem non-susceptibility due to genes or mechanisms other than the Xpert Carba-R target genes. Panel members were re-suspended in negative rectal matrix. A set of 31 commensal/enteric microorganisms was also evaluated in the study, as well as human cells. Bacteria were seeded into negative matrix at $\geq 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m l }$ in triplicate and tested with the Xpert Carba-R Assay. Viruses were tested at $> 1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { \hat { T C } I D } 5 0 \mathrm { / m l }$ or greater than $2 . 5 \dot { \mathrm { ~ x ~ } } 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ RNA copies $/ \mathrm { m l }$ . Human cells were tested at $\mathrm { 1 x 1 0 ^ { 5 } c e l l s / m l }$ . For Analytical Specificity Study panel, please refer to Table 7 and Table 8 below.

a Peptostreptococcus anaerobius was tested at $5 x \ : I 0 ^ { 5 } C F U / m l .$ .

Of the 94 potentially cross-reactive organisms and nucleic acids tested, including organisms exhibiting antibiotic resistance mechanisms other than production of KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP and OXA-48, none were detected with the Xpert Carba-R Assay. Of the 286 tests in rectal matrix, four $( 1 . 4 \% )$ runs were indeterminate (4 INVALID). All four indeterminate runs were successfully repeated and were reported as NOT DETECTED for all five targets (KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP and OXA-48) as expected. All external positive and negative controls were correctly reported as expected.

All the data were collected on the GeneXpert Dx (GX-IV) instrument using the GeneXpert Dx software version $4 . 4 \mathrm { a }$ .

f. Assay cut-off:

For IMP, VIM, NDM, KPC, and OXA-48 gene targets, the valid cycle threshold (Ct) range was 3.0 to 38.0. For the SPC, the valid Ct range was set from 3.0 to 40.0. A Ct value outside the valid range is reported as NOT DETECTED. The Ct cut-offs are included as automatic calculations in the assay definition file (ADF) provided with the Xpert Carba-R Assay. Assay cut-off values have not changed from those described in K152614.

# g. Interfering substances:

A study was conducted to assess the inhibitory effects of substances potentially encountered in rectal swab specimens on the performance of the Xpert Carba-R Assay. Twenty-four substances were evaluated at “worst case scenario” concentrations. Eight replicate positive samples were tested per substance. Negative samples consisted of pooled negative rectal swab matrix with/without the interfering substance (not seeded with carbapenemase-producing organisms). Controls consisted of positive and negative samples with no interfering substances added. Positive samples were prepared from a mix of five carbapenemase-producing organisms harboring KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP and OXA-48 gene sequences seeded into pooled negative rectal swab matrix to give concentrations that were $3 \mathbf { x }$ analytical LoD (Table 9). The list of potentially interfering substances tested is shown in Table 10.

Results showed that assay targets were detected in the presence of 22 of the 24 potentially interfering substances when tested at $0 . 2 5 \%$ w/v with the Xpert Carba-R Assay. It was noted that for fecal fat diluted into positive rectal matrix at $0 . 2 5 \% \mathrm { w / v }$ , the VIM target showed a $2 . 4 7 5 \mathrm { C t }$ delay compared to the mean $\mathrm { C t }$ of the control; however, the VIM target was still detected by the assay. In addition, a change in the Ct value was observed with the rectal swab matrix sample for the OXA target, which showed a 1.237 Ct delay compared to the mean $\mathrm { C t }$ of the control in the presence of barium sulfate at $0 . 1 \% \mathrm { \ w / v }$ . Interference with the Xpert Carba-R Assay may be observed with barium sulfate at $> 0 . 1 \% \ \mathrm { w / v }$ , Pepto-Bismol at $> 0 . 0 1 \% \ \mathrm { w / v }$ , and fecal fat at $0 . 2 5 \% \mathrm { w } / \mathrm { v }$ (for VIM) in tests with rectal swab matrix samples. Of the 404 tests (not including those test concentrations where barium sulfate and Pepto-Bismol by themselves showed high invalid rates), 2 tests provided indeterminate GeneXpert results (2 ERROR). Both indeterminate GeneXpert results were successfully repeated.

External controls gave the expected GeneXpert test result. All the data were collected using the GeneXpert Dx software version $4 . 4 \mathrm { a }$ on the GeneXpert Dx (GX-IV and GX-XVI) instruments.

# Competitive Interference

To evaluate the potential competitive inhibitory effect of multiple carbapenemaseproducing organisms on the performance of the Xpert Carba-R Assay in rectal swab specimens, a study was performed by testing various combinations of carbapenemase-producing organisms seeded at high and low concentrations into natural matrix. High concentrations of organisms corresponded to ${ \sim } 1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m l } .$ , and low concentrations corresponded to 2x LoD. An inhibitory effect was observed for three out of five targets (IMP, VIM, and OXA-48) when a low concentration of each target was present in combination with a high concentration of another assay target.

# h. Carry-over:

The purpose of the carry-over study was to determine the carry-over rate of contamination in negative samples due to the nucleic acid extraction and amplification of high positive samples in the GeneXpert cartridge. In this study, a negative sample was tested in a GeneXpert module immediately following the testing of a high titer positive sample in the same GeneXpert module. The high positive sample was composed of inactivated E. coli cells containing a plasmid with all five Xpert Carba-R target analyte genes (KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP and OXA-48 gene targets) diluted in Sample Reagent with rectal swab matrix to a concentration of $1 \mathrm { x } 1 \mathrm { \bar { 0 } ^ { 6 } C F U / m l }$ . The testing pattern was repeated 25 times on two GeneXpert modules for a total of 102 tests (25 high positive samples and 26 negative samples per module) for the positive cells in rectal swab matrix. For each day of the study, an external negative control and two types of external positive controls were tested as described previously. All 52 negative samples reported NOT DETECTED results for all five Xpert Carba-R Assay targets as expected. All positive samples correctly reported all Xpert Carba-R targets as DETECTED. There was one invalid result reported, which gave a valid result upon re-testing. Study results indicated no evidence of sample or amplicon carry-over contamination in the GeneXpert modules.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity:

In a multi-center study, performance characteristics of the Xpert Carba-R Assay were evaluated with rectal swab specimens. The positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) of the Xpert Carba-R Assay were evaluated relative to a Composite Reference Method (consisting of Reference Culture $+ \mathrm { P C R }$ and Sequencing of the amplification product). Five geographically diverse sites were selected (three across the United States and two in Europe), and prospectively paired rectal swab specimens were collected from subjects who were hospitalized or in a long-term care facility. In the study, one swab of a pair was used for Xpert Carba-R Assay testing. Highly soiled rectal swabs were excluded from the study. Contrived specimens were included in the study due to the expected low prevalence for some Xpert Carba-R Assay target genes.

For the Reference Culture, the second swab specimen was inoculated into $1 1 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ MacConkey enrichment broth containing a $1 0 ~ \mu \ g$ meropenem disk and incubated overnight at $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . An aliquot of MacConkey broth culture was spread onto a MacConkey agar plate, and a $1 0 ~ \mu \ g$ meropenem disk was placed on the plate. After an overnight incubation at $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , the zone of clearing was measured. If growth was observed within a $2 8 \mathrm { m m }$ zone (including the meropenem disk), species identification of the organisms was performed after subculture of colonies to sheep blood agar. Organism susceptibility status (susceptible, intermediate or resistant) to meropenem, ertapenem and imipenem was determined using CLSI standard test methods (M07- A9) and the interpretive criteria found in the FDA drug label and CLSI M100-S24. Carbapenem non-susceptible organisms were then subcultured to sheep blood agar (with a meropenem disk placed between the $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ and $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ streak) and incubated overnight at $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Three to five well-isolated colonies of the same morphotype, as described in CLSI M07-A9, were collected and sent for sequencing.

DNA from the carbapenem non-susceptible isolates was purified, quantified, and amplified using primers specific to all 5 target genes that were validated and amplify a larger region than the Xpert Carba-R primers. The production of the appropriate sized amplification products was confirmed on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. If no bands were shown on the Bioanalyzer for any of the five target genes, the isolate was not sent for sequence analysis and the Reference Method result was considered negative for the five target genes. PCR and sequencing was not performed for specimens

where there was no growth in the $2 8 \mathrm { m m }$ zone, if the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing identified a susceptible isolate, or organisms had intrinsic resistance to all the carbapenems tested (e.g. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia).

A total of 802 prospective rectal swab specimens were initially enrolled in the clinical study, of which 785 were eligible for inclusion. The ineligible specimens included:

• (14) specimens from subjects with incomplete specimen information   
• (1) specimen was too soiled (1) specimen was previously enrolled (1) specimen from subject not hospitalized or in long-term care facility

An additional 30 specimens were excluded due to:

• (10) shipping delay/testing delay   
• (4) invalid GX control or GX indeterminate/invalid   
• (16) organisms where there were no zone interpretations listed corresponding to intermediate or resistant to determine non-susceptibility

Thus, 755 rectal swab specimens remained compliant and were included in the final analysis for the prospective study. Performance of the Xpert Carba-R Assay was assessed separately for each type of resistance marker target and compared to Reference Culture $^ +$ Sequencing result. With the rectal swab specimens, the study showed that $9 8 . 9 \%$ (747/755) of the specimens produced a valid result on the first run. Four (4) INVALID and Four (4) ERRORS occurred, which upon re-testing yielded a valid result.

In addition to the prospective study, well-characterized isolates carrying each assay target were tested in a contrived study. Strains were re-suspended in rectal matrix before testing with the Xpert Carba-R Assay at 1x, 3x, and $1 0 \mathrm { x }$ LoD concentrations. The following numbers of unique isolates were evaluated in the study spanning multiple gram negative species (Table 13 and Table 14):

Discordant samples were tested with an alternate PCR method when the Xpert CarbaR Assay result was positive and the Reference Method result was negative. An aliquot of the MacConkey broth was used to extract DNA and amplify any potential targets by PCR before sending for DNA sequencing. These results were not used to change the original performance data (See results in the footnotes to Table 15).

Study results of the Xpert Carba-R Assay compared to the Reference Method are shown in Table 15 stratified by individual target for prospective and contrived studies.

a PCR yielded no bands for sequencing. b An organism was not isolated from reference culture, therefore reference sequencing was not performed.

External controls for the Xpert Carba-R Assay consisted of one negative sample, one sample positive for all (5) targets of the assay, and five different positive controls each containing a single target of the assay. The negative control and five-target positive controls were run on each day that study samples were tested, along with two of the single-target positive controls (on a rotating basis). Study samples were not run until correct results were obtained for each of the four controls. External control data were compiled across all sites and overall QC results were acceptable.

Yes ___X_ __ or No

3. Specimen Identification: Similar to previously cleared system.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Specific instructions should be followed for the collection of rectal swab specimens. The user refers to a Reference Diagram supplied by Cepheid to determine the acceptability of swab specimens. Any specimens that are highly soiled per the Reference Diagram must be excluded from the study. Swabs are then placed in the appropriate collection device. One swab is added to Sample Reagent for Xpert Carba-R Assay testing. An aliquot of sample $( 1 . 7 \mathrm { m l } )$ is then transferred to the sample chamber of the disposable, single-use fluidic cartridge (Xpert Carba-R cartridge). The user initiates a test from the system user interface and places the cartridge into the GeneXpert Instrument System. Additional sample preparation, amplification, and real-time detection are all fully-automated and completed by the instrument system.

# 5. Calibration:

The Xpert Check kit is used by the customer or by Cepheid personnel to perform the calibration check of the instrument. The Xpert Check is not provided with the instrument since the instrument is originally calibrated by Cepheid. A calibration check is recommended on an annual basis. In the GeneXpert Operator’s Manual (Calibration Section), the user is instructed to contact Cepheid Technical Support for information about calibration.

6. Quality Control:

Quality control is addressed for each separately cleared assay to be run on the instrument.

See section M1(c) for information on internal and external controls.
