Device Name VIDAS B•R•A•H•M•S PCT (PCT)

Indications for Use (Describe)

VIDAS® B·R·A·H·M·S PCT™ (PCT) is an automated test for use on the instruments of the $\mathrm { \Delta V I D A S ^ { \mathrm { ( R ) } } }$ family for the determination of human procalcitonin in human serum or plasma (lithium heparinate) using the ELFA (Enzyme-Linked Fluorescent Assay) technique.

VIDAS® B·R·A·H·M·S PCT™ (PCT) is intended for use in conjunction with other laboratory findings and clinical assessments to aid in the risk assessment of critically ill patients on their first day of ICU admission for progression to severe sepsis and septic shock.

VIDAS® B·R·A·H·M·S PCT™ (PCT) is also intended for use to determine the change of PCT level over time as an aid in assessing the cumulative 28-day risk of all-cause mortality in conjunction with other laboratory findings and clinical assessments for patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock in the ICU or when obtained in the emergency department or other medical wards prior to ICU admission.

Procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker associated with the inflammatory response to bacterial infection that aids in the risk assessment of critically ill patients on their first day of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission for progression to severe sepsis and septic shock. The percent change in PCT level over time also aids in the prediction of cumulative 28-day mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

CT levels on the first day of ICU admission above $2 . 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ are associated with a higher risk for progression to severe sepsis nd/or septic shock than PCT levels below $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

A PCT level that declines $\leq 8 0 \%$ from the day that severe sepsis or septic shock was clinically diagnosed (Day 0) to four days after clinical diagnosis (Day 4) is associated with higher cumulative 28-day risk of all-cause mortality than a decline $> 8 0 \%$ .

The combination of the first PCT level $( \leq 2 . 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ or $\cdot > 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ) at initial diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock with the patient's clinical course and the change in PCT level over time until Day 4 provides important additional information about the mortality risk.

The PCT level on Day 1 (the day after severe sepsis or septic shock is first clinically diagnosed) can be used to calculate the percent change in PCT level at Day 4 if the Day 0 measurement is unavailable.

# B. Device Name

Trade Name: VIDAS® B·R·A·H·M·S PCTTM (PCT)   
Common Name: Endotoxin Assay   
Classification Name: Device to detect and measure non-microbial analyte(s) in human clinical specimens to aid in assessment of patients with suspected sepsis (21 CFR 866.3215, Product Code PMT) – Class II in vitro Diagnostic device

# C. Predicate Devices

Predicate device 1, trade name: B·R·A·H·M·S PCT Sensitive KRYPTOR® (DEN150009)

Predicate device 2, trade name: VIDAS® B·R·A·H·M·S PCTTM (K071146)

# D. Device Description

The assay principle combines a one-step immunoassay sandwich method with a final fluorescent detection (ELFA).

The Solid Phase Receptacle $\mathsf { ( S P R ^ { \otimes } ) }$ , serves as the solid phase as well as the pipetting device.   
Reagents for the assay are ready-to-use and pre-dispensed in the sealed reagent strips.

All of the assay steps are performed automatically by the instrument. The sample is transferred into the wells containing anti-procalcitonin antibodies labeled with alkaline phosphatase (conjugate). The sample/conjugate mixture is cycled in and out of the ${ \mathsf { S P R } } ^ { \otimes }$ several times. This operation enables the antigen to bind with the immunoglobulins fixed to the interior wall of the $\mathsf { S P R } ^ { \odot }$ and the conjugate to form a sandwich. Unbound compounds are eliminated during washing steps.

Two detection steps are performed successively. During each step, the substrate (4-Methylumbelliferyl phosphate) is cycled in and out of the $\mathsf { S P R } ^ { \mathfrak { C } }$ . The conjugate enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of this substrate into a fluorescent product (4-Methyl-umbelliferone) the fluorescence of which is measured at $4 5 0 \ \mathsf { n m }$ . The intensity of the fluorescence is proportional to the concentration of antigen present in the sample.

At the end of the assay, results are automatically calculated by the instrument in relation to two calibration curves corresponding to the two detection steps. A fluorescence threshold value determines the calibration curve to be used for each sample. The results are then printed out.

# E. Indications for Use

VIDAS® B•R•A•H•M•S PCT™ (PCT) is an automated test for use on the instruments of the VIDAS® family for the determination of human procalcitonin in human serum or plasma (lithium heparinate) using the ELFA (Enzyme-Linked Fluorescent Assay) technique.

${ \mathsf { V I D A S } } ^ { \otimes }$ B•R•A•H•M•S PCT™ (PCT) is intended for use in conjunction with other laboratory findings and clinical assessments to aid in the risk assessment of critically ill patients on their first day of ICU admission for progression to severe sepsis and septic shock.

VIDAS® B•R•A•H•M•S PCT™ (PCT) is also intended for use to determine the change of PCT level over time as an aid in assessing the cumulative 28-day risk of all-cause mortality in conjunction with other laboratory findings and clinical assessments for patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock in the ICU or when obtained in the emergency department or other medical wards prior to ICU admission.

Procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker associated with the inflammatory response to bacterial infection that aids in the risk assessment of critically ill patients on their first day of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission for progression to severe sepsis and septic shock. The percent change in PCT level over time also aids in the prediction of cumulative 28-day mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

PCT levels on the first day of ICU admission above $2 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ are associated with a higher risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock than PCT levels below $0 . 5 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

A PCT level that declines $\leq 8 0 \%$ from the day that severe sepsis or septic shock was clinically diagnosed (Day 0) to four days after clinical diagnosis (Day 4) is associated with higher cumulative 28- day risk of all-cause mortality than a decline $> 8 0 \%$ .

The combination of the first PCT level $( \leq 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L } \ \mathrm { o r } > 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ ) at initial diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock with the patient’s clinical course and the change in PCT level over time until Day 4 provides important additional information about the mortality risk.

The PCT level on Day 1 (the day after severe sepsis or septic shock is first clinically diagnosed) can be used to calculate the percent change in PCT level at Day 4 if the Day 0 measurement is unavailable.

# Linearity

The test linearity was studied on the ${ \mathsf { V I D A S } } ^ { \otimes }$ and ${ \mathsf { V I D A S } } ^ { \otimes } \ 3$ instruments according to a procedure taken from the CLSI EP6-A guideline. The test is linear over the complete measurement range.

# H. Clinical Testing

A study was conducted on a population of 858 adult patients recruited across 13 investigational sites in the US to assess the performance of VIDAS® B·R·A·H·M·S PCT™ (PCT) on ${ \mathsf { V I D A S } } ^ { \otimes } { 3 }$ and VIDAS® for the prediction of cumulative 28-day all-cause mortality.

In the per protocol population (598 patients) was comprised of $44 \%$ female and $56 \%$ male patients with a mean age of 64 years, diagnosed either with severe sepsis $( 5 1 \% )$ or septic shock $( 4 9 \% )$ , presenting mainly with community acquired infections $( 9 1 \% )$ and less frequently with nosocomial infections $( 9 \% )$ . All patients were admitted into ICU at some point during their hospital stay, $44 \%$ were still located in ICU at Day 4 of the study (“ICU” group), whereas $56 \%$ were at Day 4 already transferred to a location outside of the ICU (“non-ICU” group).

Cumulative 28-day all-cause mortality did not differ significantly for male vs. female patients $( \textsf { X } ^ { 2 } \textsf { p - }$ value $= 0 . 8 4$ ).

\* Unavailable patients results were either not available for testing (VIDAS 3 ${ \mathsf n } = 2 4$ , VIDAS ${ \mathfrak { n } } = 2 9$ ), or were below assay measuring range of $0 . 0 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ (VIDAS $3 n = 1 1$ , VIDAS ${ \mathsf n } = 1 3$ ).

The study demonstrated that for patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock, the 28- Day mortality was statistically significantly increased for patients with ∆PCT $\leq 8 0 \%$ compared to patients with ∆PCT $> 8 0 \%$ :

Binary ∆PCT was significantly associated with 28-day cumulative mortality (Two-sided Fisher’s Exact Test $\mathsf { p }$ -value 0.0003 and 0.002 for ${ \mathsf { V I D A S } } ^ { \otimes } { 3 }$ and ${ \mathsf { V I D A S } } ^ { \otimes }$ respectively for ∆PCT based on Day 0 and $\mathsf { p }$ -value $= 0 . 0 0 3$ and 0.019 for ${ \mathsf { V I D A S } } ^ { \otimes } { 3 }$ and ${ \mathsf { V I D A S } } ^ { \otimes }$ respectively for ∆PCT based on Day 1) and this association remained significant in each patient location subgroup, ICU vs. non ICU at Day 4 (for ${ \mathsf { V I D A S } } ^ { \otimes } { 3 }$ and ${ \mathsf { V I D A } } { \bar { \mathsf { S } } } ^ { \textregistered }$ respectively Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Test $\mathsf { p }$ -value $= 0 . 0 0 6$ and 0.016 using ∆PCT based on Day 0 and $\mathsf { p }$ -value $= 0 . 0 2 3$ and 0.073 using ∆PCT based on Day 1). The mortality in the group with $\Delta \mathsf { P C T } \leq 8 0 \ \%$ was increased by a factor of 2.1 on ${ \mathsf { V I D A S } } ^ { \widehat { \mathbb { B } } } 3$ and 1.9 on ${ \mathsf { V I D A S } } ^ { \otimes }$ compared to the group with $\Delta \mathsf { P C T } > 8 0 \%$ using ∆PCT based on Day 0 (factor 1.8 on ${ \mathsf { V I D A S } } ^ { \otimes } { 3 }$ and 1.6 on ${ \mathsf { V I D A } } { \bar { \mathsf { S } } } ^ { \textregistered }$ using $\Delta \mathsf { P C T }$ based on Day 1). The observed mortality risk was generally higher in the ICU subgroup than in the non-ICU group (5.4 to $1 1 . 4 \%$ vs. 18.4 to $3 1 . 6 \%$ ). In each subgroup, the mortality was even higher for patients with a ∆PCT ≤ $80 \%$ than for patients with a $\Delta \mathsf { P C T } > 8 0 \%$ .

Supplementary classification of patients based on the patient location on Day 4 and initial PCT level $( < 2 . 0$ vs. $\geq 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ at Day 0 (or Day 1) showed that in each patient location and initial PCT level subgroup, a PCT decrease $\leq 8 0 \%$ from Day 0 (or Day 1) to Day 4 constitutes a higher risk for mortality within 28 days compared to a higher PCT decline $( > 8 0 \% )$ . For the prediction of absolute mortality risks, ICU disposition at Day 4 and initial PCT level at Day 0 (or Day 1) should be considered in addition to binary ∆PCT (≤ $80 \%$ or $>80 \%$ ).

Significantly reduced or increased mortality were observed by patient location and initial PCT level subgroups:

a) Patients still receiving ICU care on Day 4 or patients with initial PCT level $> 2 . 0 \ \mathsf { n g / m L }$ have a higher mortality risk from study Day 4 to the end of follow-up time (28 days) when the ∆PCT is ≤ $80 \%$ compared to when the ∆PCT is $> 8 0 \%$ .

b) among patients who are still in the ICU on Day 4, patients with $\Delta \mathsf { P C T } > 8 0 \%$ and an initial PCT level of $\leq 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ on Day 0 have a particularly lower cumulative 28-day mortality risk compared to patients with an initial PCT level at Day 0 o $\lceil > 2 . 0 \ \mathsf { n g / m L }$ $( 2 . 2 \%$ vs. $20 . 3 \%$ on ${ \mathsf { V I D A S } } ^ { \otimes } 3$ ; $1 . 8 \%$ vs. $2 1 . 4 \%$ on VIDAS® ). In addition, regardless of the initial PCT level, patients in the ICU on Day 4 which have ∆PCT $\leq 8 0 \%$ (Day 0 to Day 4) have an even higher mortality risk $( 2 6 . 4 \%$ to $3 4 . 1 \%$ on VIDAS3; $2 7 . 0 \%$ to $3 3 . 5 \%$ on VIDAS® ).

c) even when they are no longer in the ICU on Day 4, patients with an initial PCT level $> 2 . 0$ ng/mL and with a $\Delta \mathsf { P C T } \leq 8 0 \%$ (Day 0 to Day 4) remain at high mortality risk $1 4 . 1 \%$ on ${ \mathsf { V I D A S } } ^ { \otimes } { 3 }$ ; $1 3 . 4 \%$ on ${ \mathsf { V I D A S } } ^ { \otimes }$ ). Overall, a lower mortality risk was observed for patients discharged from the ICU before or on Day 4 with an initial PCT level ≤ 2.0 ng/mL than for patients with an initial PCT level of $> 2 . 0$ ng/mL $( 3 . 7 \%$ to $9 . 5 \%$ vs. $5 . 8 \%$ to $1 4 . 1 \%$ on VIDAS3; $4 . 2 \%$ to $9 . 2 \%$ vs. $6 . 5 \%$ to $1 3 . 4 \%$ on VIDAS® ).

The table below shows the 28-day cumulative mortality risk and prognostic accuracy by binary ∆PCT group $( \leq 8 0 \% 0 \mathrm { r } > 8 0 \% )$ , by the selection of either Day 0 or Day 1 for the ∆PCT calculation, by patient location at Day 4, and by initial PCT level.

Survival probability until Day 28 for Patients without ICU Care on Day 4

Performance of binary ∆PCT from Day 0 to Day 4 for the prognosis of 28-day cumulative mortality risk was quantified by Cox proportional hazards regression. Hazard ratio of 2.27 and 2.05 were observed for ${ \mathsf { V I D A S } } ^ { \otimes } 3$ and ${ \mathsf { V I D A S } } ^ { \otimes }$ respectively: patients with ∆PCT $\leq 8 0 \%$ have about a 2-fold higher 28- day mortality risk than patients with ∆PCT $> 8 0 \%$ .

In the table below, the relative mortality risk (univariate hazard ratios) are shown for binary ∆PCT, and for other clinical factors evaluated as separate predictors of mortality, for indication.

The binary ∆PCT was shown to have an added-value related to other mortality predictors in the prognosis of the risk of 28-day mortality in patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock. The relative mortality risk (Hazard ratio) for binary $\Delta \mathsf { P C T }$ and selected predictors (Patient location at Day 4, APACHE, max SOFA, Age) reported below were estimated with $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals using Cox multiple regression models adjusted for scores and other mortality predictors.

\*The models also included the following predictors considered as covariates (hazard ratio results not shown): Antibiotic Adequacy, Sepsis Severity, Biological Infection Type, Clinical Infection Type, Positive Blood Culture, PCT on Day 0, Gender. In

the analysis, missing values for predictors were multiple imputed assuming they were Missing at Random (MAR), with the multiple imputations combined according to Rubin’s rules.

Note: For binary predictors, the risk estimate compares the hazards for the two binary results. For continuous predictors, the hazard ratio (HR) was calculated for one standard deviation (SD) change in the predictor.

The change of PCT over time can also be described by the ratio of PCT values from Day 4 to Day 0 (or Day 1):

$$
P C T _ { \mathit { r a t i o } } = \frac { P C T _ { \mathit { D a y } 4 } } { P C T _ { \mathit { D a y } 0 ( \mathrm { o r \mathit { D a y } 1 ) } } }
$$

A ∆PCT of $80 \%$ corresponds to a PCT ratio of 0.2 (i.e. PCT level at Day 4 is 5 times less than PCT level at Day 0, or Day 1). When ∆PCT is $\leq 8 0 \%$ , the PCT ratio is $\ge 0 . 2$ , which is associated with a higher risk for cumulative 28-day all-cause mortality in patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock. Likewise, a PCT ratio $< 0 . 2$ indicates a lower risk for mortality within 28 days.

On a continuous scale, the larger the PCT ratio, the higher the relative mortality risk is. In the following table, the relative increase in mortality risk (hazard ratio) are reported for a patient with any given PCT ratio compared to a patient with a 2-fold lower PCT ratio. For comparison, other selected predictors (APACHE, max SOFA, Age, Patient location at Day 4) are indicated with corresponding equivalents in standard deviation (0.50 SD on VIDAS3 and 0.51 SD on VIDAS for Day 0 to Day 4; 0.69 SD on VIDAS3 and 0.67 SD on VIDAS for Day 1 to Day 4).
