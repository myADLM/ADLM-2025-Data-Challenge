# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The ARIES® Flu A/B & RSV Assay is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the direct detection and differentiation of influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) nucleic acid in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection in conjunction with clinical and laboratory findings. The test is intended for use as an aid in the differential diagnosis of Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV in humans and is not intended to detect Influenza C.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus or RSV infection and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not rule-out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease. The use of additional laboratory testing (e.g. bacterial culture, immunofluorescence, X-ray findings) and clinical presentation must be taken into consideration in order to obtain the final diagnosis of respiratory viral infection.

Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2014-2015 and the 2015-2016 influenza seasons when influenza A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 pandemic were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other Influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

The ARIES® Flu A/B & RSV Assay is indicated for use with the ARIES® Systems.

2. Indication(s) for use: Same as intended use

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): Prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements: For use with the ARIES System or ARIES M1 System

Note: The ARIES System and ARIES M1 System are collectively referred to as the ARIES Systems throughout this memo.

# I. Device Description:

The ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based qualitative in vitro diagnostic test system that consists of the ARIES Systems with its included software, an assay-specific cassette, and an assay-specific protocol file. The ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay cassette is a disposable, single-use cassette containing nucleic acid purification reagents, internal sample process control, and an assay-specific master mix designed to perform the designated assay on one sample. The ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay cassette is used to directly detect and differentiate influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) nucleic acid in NPS specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection. The assay detects the matrix protein genes of influenza A and influenza B viruses, the fusion gene of RSV, and a RNA Sample Processing Control.

The specimen is lysed and nucleic acid is extracted using the ARIES Systems. An extractable sample processing control (SPC) target is present in the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV assay cassette and is processed with the specimen. The Ct (threshold cycle) value of the SPC is designed to verify proper specimen lysis and nucleic acid extraction, to identify PCR inhibition if any, and verify proper function of the extraction system and the real-time PCR instrument. The Tm (melting temperature) value of the SPC is used as a reference for determining the target Tm.

The extracted nucleic acid and SPC are transferred via magnetic beads through the cassette to the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay lyophilized PCR reagents in the PCR tube that contains target-specific primer pairs labeled with distinct fluorophore labels. PCR amplification is performed and assay fluorescence is monitored on the ARIES Systems. Incorporation of the quencher-labeled nucleotide causes a decrease in assay fluorescence. Following amplification, the reaction is slowly heated and fluorescence is monitored. The strands of the amplification products will separate at a specific Tm that is indicated by an increase in fluorescence. The instrument fluorescence output is analyzed and test results are determined using the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay Protocol File. A printed results report is generated.

# L. Test Principle:

Primary sample (NPS specimen in universal transport medium) is added directly to the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay cassette sample chamber. The cassette is then placed into an ARIES magazine which can hold up to six cassettes. The magazine is inserted into an ARIES instrument. A barcode on top of the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay cassette is automatically scanned by the ARIES instrument, associating a preloaded ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay Protocol File with the cassette. The ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay Protocol File contains the necessary parameters to run the cassette, analyze data, and generate reports.

Once a run is started, the sample processing control (SPC) is automatically added to the sample chamber of the cassette to control for sample lysis, recovery of extracted nucleic acid, detection of inhibitory substances, and confirmation of PCR reagent integrity. Sample and SPC lysis, as well as isolation and purification of nucleic acids, are automated within the ARIES Systems and the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay cassette. Purified nucleic acids are automatically transferred to the cassette’s PCR tube that contains the lyophilized Influenza A/B & RSV Master Mix for the PCR amplification step. The lyophilized Influenza A/B & RSV Master Mix contains four sets of primers: one primer set for the SPC target, and an independent primer set for each pathogen.

The ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay chemistry is based on an expanded genetic alphabet technology, consisting of synthetic DNA base pair $2 "$ -deoxy-5-methyl-isocytidine (iC): 2'- deoxyisoguanosine (iG). The isobases (iC and iG) pair specifically with each other and not with natural nucleotides. In addition, isobases are efficiently incorporated during PCR. During PCR amplification, a quencher-modified iGTP is incorporated by the polymerase opposite an iC and a fluorophore reporter attached to a PCR primer. If the target is present and is amplified, assay fluorescence decreases with every cycle as amplification product accumulates. The decrease in assay fluorescence is monitored in real time using the ARIES Systems. Following PCR, the amplification products are thermally denatured and assay fluorescence is monitored. The strands of the amplification products are separated and assay fluorescence increases, thus enabling determination of the Tm of the amplicon.

# Quality Control

ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay Cassette contains a sample processing control, which is processed with the sample and analyzed during the amplification reaction.

External controls should be used in accordance with local, state, federal accrediting organizations, as applicable. For example, reference influenza A, influenza B and RSV strains or well characterized influenza A, influenza B and RSV clinical isolates may be used as positive controls; universal transport medium may be used as a negative control.

# Interpretation of Results

The ARIES analysis software determines results for the sample and the SPC based on the amplification cycle (Ct) value and the melting temperature (Tm) value provided in the Assay Protocol File. All assay outcomes are described below.

Reproducibility

Reproducibility of the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay was evaluated by testing one lot of ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay Cassettes on two ARIES Systems by two operators at each of three clinical sites on five non-consecutive days.

The reproducibility panel was prepared containing a moderate positive (10x LoD), low positive ( $3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD), and high negative $0 . 2 \mathrm { x }$ LoD) independently for one influenza A (Influenza A/Hong Kong/8/68), one influenza B (Influenza B/Florida/04/06), one RSV-A (RSV A2), and one RSV-B (RSV B WV/14617/85) virus. Virus strains were formulated in a simulated nasal matrix (SNM) consisting of 50:50 dilution of pooled negative clinical specimens in universal transport media. A true negative sample consisted of only SNM. The reproducibility panel was prepared, blinded, randomized, and shipped frozen to each of the testing sites. Each panel member was tested in triplicate by each operator on each day of testing. The results of the reproducibility study are shown in the following two tables.

a RSV B WV/14617/45 and influenza B/Florida/04/06 High Negative samples generated positivity that exceeded the expected positivity results of $20 \%$ . b Two Flu A/B & RSV Negative replicates tested by different operators, on different test dates, on different instruments, with different cassette lots generated late Ct false influenza B positive results. Overall percentage of negative specimens that correctly generated negative results for all three assay targets is $9 8 \%$ .

# Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility

Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility of the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay was evaluated by one operator using one ARIES System to test three lots of ARIES Flu A/B & RSV cassettes. The test sample panel is the same as one described in the site-to-site reproducibility study above. A minimum of nine replicates of each target concentration were run three times for each cassette lot. The test results showed that the reproducibility across three cassette lots met the acceptance criteria o $f \geq 9 5 \%$ for Moderate Positive, Low Positive and Negative Influenza A, Influenza B, RSV A, and RSV B samples.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable; qualitative assay.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Stability:

Specimen Stability (Fresh vs. Frozen)

The specimen stability was determined with contrived fresh and frozen specimens stored at either $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (fresh) or ${ } _ { - 6 5 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to ${ } _ { - 9 5 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (frozen) and tested with the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay. This was assessed by testing 60 replicates per single pathogen target (influenza A/Hong Kong/8/68, influenza B/Florida/04/06, or RSV A2) prepared at three test concentrations (30 low positive (2-3xLoD), 15 moderate positive (10xLoD), and 15 high positive (100xLoD)) across different time points extending up to 12 months. In addition to the 60 replicates for each target organism, 6 replicates of simulated nasal matrix were tested at each time point. Also, to address the effect of repeated freeze/thaw cycles on the assay performance, all five time point sample sets were initially frozen for one hour, thawed, and re-frozen prior to testing frozen samples at each time point. Results to date show that specimens for the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay are stable for up to 7 days when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and up to 3 months when stored at $- 6 5 ^ { \circ }$ to ${ } _ { - 9 5 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Kit Stability

The real-time stability study was performed to evaluate the shelf life of ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay cassettes. Stability was established by testing six replicates of positive specimens and six replicates of negative specimens on three different lots of ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay cassettes stored at two different temperatures: $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ (2– $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and room temperature $( 1 5 - 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ at 10 different time points extending up to 19 months. Results to date show that ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay cassettes can be stable for up to 5 months when stored at either $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ $( 2 \mathrm { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ or room temperature (15– $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Open Box Stability

An open box stability study was performed in order to evaluate performance of ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay Cassettes after they were removed from their individual pouches. Cassettes were removed from their pouches and placed on a laboratory bench where they were exposed to ambient temperatures, humidity, and light for up to ten hours. Testing was performed by one operator across three lots of cassettes on four ARIES Systems. Results show that ARIES Flu A/B and RSV Assay Cassettes are stable for up to 10 hours at room temperature after removal from the cassette pouch.

# Controls:

Process Control

The sample processing control is present inside each test cassette to control sample lysis, nucleic acid extraction, and proper reagent, cassette, ARIES System, and assay protocol performance. The SPC has a known Tm range and Ct range. Each time an assay is run, the system measures the temperature and fluorescence intensity of the SPC control to ensure the thermal and optical subsystems have remained in calibration.

# External Controls

External controls should be used in accordance with local, state, federal accrediting organizations, as applicable. For example, reference influenza A, influenza B, and RSV strains or well characterized influenza A, influenza B, and RSV clinical isolates may be used as positive controls; universal transport medium may be used as a negative control.

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Detection (LoD) was established for the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay using three influenza A, two influenza B, and two respiratory syncytial virus strains diluted in a simulated nasal matrix. Preliminary LoD concentrations were determined by performing a six-point, five-fold dilution series of each virus strain tested. At least six replicates of each of the dilutions were tested to determine a preliminary LoD using one lot of ARIES Flu A/B & RSV cassettes. The LoD was defined as the lowest concentration that had a positivity rate of $\ge 9 5 \%$ .

The LoD concentrations determined in the preliminary study were confirmed by testing 20 replicates of the same virus strain diluted to the preliminary LoD concentrations. The final confirmed LoDs for each of the seven virus strains are presented in the table below.

# e. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity):

The analytical reactivity/inclusivity of the ARIES Flu $\mathrm { A } / \mathrm { B }$ and RSV Assay was evaluated against twenty-four influenza A strains, seven influenza B strains, and three respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) strains, which differ from those strains included in the LoD study. Each strain was diluted in the simulated nasal matrix to a concentration near the LoD $\mathrm { ( 1 x 1 0 ^ { 1 } T C I D _ { 5 0 } / m l }$ or $\mathrm { C E I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m l } )$ ) and tested in triplicate. For five strains, additional testing at $\mathrm { 1 x 1 0 ^ { 2 } T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m l }$ or $\mathrm { C E I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m l }$ was required to achieve $100 \%$ positivity. For two strains, additional testing at $\mathrm { 1 x 1 0 ^ { 3 } T C I D } _ { 5 0 } \mathrm { \bar { / } m l }$ or $\mathrm { C E I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m l }$ was required to achieve $100 \%$ positivity. The study results are shown in the table below.

a Copies/ml determined by quantitative PCR assay. b Color Changing Unit (CCU) is calculated according to a modified Reed-Muench method based on the dilutions which produced a color change in the broth.

The microorganisms tested consisted of 14 viral and 18 bacterial strains representing common respiratory pathogens, or those potentially encountered in the human nasopharynx region. All organisms were diluted in the simulated nasal matrix that was negative for influenza A, influenza B, and RSV and tested by the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay in triplicate. The bacterial strains were tested at concentrations $\geq { 1 0 } ^ { 6 }$ cfu/ml and virus strains $\mathrm { a t } \geq 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m l }$ , or the highest available concentration. Under the conditions of this study, thirty-one microorganisms were correctly reported as “influenza A negative; influenza B negative; RSV negative” by the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay. For Parainfluenza type 1 strain, one of the three replicates

initially was reported as a weak influenza B positive $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { C t = } 4 0 )$ ). Additional five replicates of the same Parainfluenza type 1 strain were tested with all five replicates yielding negative target results.

# Microbial Interference

Microbial interference for the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay was assessed with the 32 potential cross reactive microorganisms. These bacterial and viral strains were tested at the same concentrations as described in the cross-reactivity study above. The potential interfering organisms were spiked into simulated nasal matrix containing either one strain of influenza A/Hong Kong/8/68, influenza B/Florida/04/06, RSV A2, or RSV B WV/14617/85 at a concentration of 3X LoD. All target strains added to cross reacting organism samples were tested in triplicate on the ARIES System. The results are summarized below.

a Measles $^ +$ RSV A was tested with eight replicates total due to operator errors. b Enterovirus $7 1 + \mathrm { R S V B }$ positivity $( 3 / 3 )$ represents the re-testing of freshly prepared target material. c Initial testing of three replicates resulted in two out of three positive results; subsequent testing with five replicates resulted in five out of five, or a total of seven out of eight positive results.

Under the conditions of this study, the results demonstrate that the ARIES Flu A/B and RSV assay does not cross-react with any of the 32 common respiratory microorganisms tested.

# Competitive Interference/Co-infection

The study was designed to evaluate the ability of the ARIES Flu A/B and RSV assay to detect influenza A, influenza B, RSV A, and RSV B in the presence of a coinfection. Competitive interference can occur when one analyte is near the LoD and an additional analyte is present at high concentration. Analytes were tested at high $( >$ $\mathrm { 1 x 1 0 ^ { 5 } T C I D _ { 5 0 } / m l ) }$ and low concentrations (1.5X LoD) using three replicates in various combinations, excluding RSV $\mathbf { A } + \mathbf { R } \mathbf { S } \mathbf { V } \mathrm { ~ B ~ }$ due to the assay’s inability to distinguish between RSV subtypes. The results for each analyte in combination with another competitive analyte are shown in the table below.

a High concentration of influenza A had inhibitory effect on RSV A2 at a concentration lower than 3x LoD.

# g. Interfering substances:

The potential inhibitory effect of non-microbial substances expected to be found in nasopharyngeal swab specimens was evaluated. Three replicates of each of influenza A/Hong Kong/8/68, influenza B/Florida/04/06, RSV A2, and RSV B WV/14617/85 strains were tested with the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay at concentrations of 3X LoD with a clinically relevant concentration of each potentially interfering substance spiked into the contrived sample; additionally, universal transport medium was spiked with the same concentration of each substance and tested for assay interference. The evaluated substances are listed in the table below with tested concentrations shown.

The results of the study demonstrate that all influenza A, influenza B, and RSV samples were $100 \%$ positive in the presence of a non-microbial substance; all negative sample results containing only the non-microbial substance were $100 \%$ negative, with the exception of FluMist.

Positive influenza results obtained in a patient who received FluMist prior to sample collection may be due to detection of the live attenuated influenza vaccine virus and may mask a true positive result caused by an influenza infection. Additionally,

FluMist may interfere with RSV detection due to high concentration of vaccine virus nucleic acid, causing a possible RSV false negative result. This is addressed in the Analytical Performance section of the ARIES FLU A/B & RSV Product Insert and an appropriate limitation is included in the labeling.

# h. Carry-Over/Cross-Contamination:

Carry-over and Cross-Contamination for the ARIES Flu $\mathrm { A } / \mathrm { B }$ and RSV Assay were evaluated by testing 30 high concentration influenza A positive samples (A/Victoria/361/2011, $\mathrm { 1 x \tilde { 1 0 } ^ { 5 . 0 2 } T C I D _ { 5 0 } / m l ) }$ in series alternating with 30 influenza A negative samples (i.e., universal transport medium). The high positive samples were run adjacent to negative samples across 10 consecutive runs on one ARIES System. Under the conditions of this study, no evidence of carry-over or cross contamination was observed in the ARIES System.

# i. Assay cut-off:

For the ARIES Flu A/B and RSV Assay, each target (influenza A, Influenza B, RSV and sample processing control) has its own Ct cut-off value, Tm window, and Tm Peak Threshold, all of which are used to determine the assay result for the detection target as positive or negative. These assay parameters were determined by analysis of pre-clinical data derived from internal verification studies using the comparator assay (an FDA-cleared multiplex molecular test for respiratory pathogens). The parameter values are outlined below, and are hard-coded into the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay Protocol File.

These assay protocol file parameter values were utilized in the determination of assay performance in the multi-site clinical trial conducted for the ARIES Flu A/B and RSV Assay.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable.

b. Matrix comparison:

A matrix equivalency study was performed to establish equivalency of a simulated nasal matrix consisting of 50:50 dilution of pooled negative clinical specimens in Copan universal transport medium versus a natural matrix (pooled negative clinical specimens) when used in the ARIES Flu A/B and RSV Assay. Study samples were prepared as a four-point, five-fold dilution series of representative Influenza A, Influenza B, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus strains in both the simulated nasal matrix and the pooled negative clinical matrix with the lowest dilution point targeting 3-5x LoD. Each concentration level for each viral target strain was tested in six replicates for each matrix type for a total of 48 tests per virus strain. Additionally, six replicates of the simulated nasal matrix and six replicates of the pooled negative clinical matrix were tested without the introduction of virus strain materials. The results of the study are shown in the tables below.

c. Fresh versus frozen equivalency:

Please refer to the “Specimen Stability (Fresh vs. Frozen)” of this document.

d. Swab comparison:

The nasopharyngeal swab equivalency study was performed to evaluate the reproducibility of the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay using three representative nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) types (flocked, rayon, and polyester) and two different swab sizes (mini-tip and regular). All swab types and swab sizes were evaluated with influenza A (A/Hong Kong/8/68), influenza B (B/Florida/04/06), and RSV (RSV A2) viral cultures prepared as a three point, five-fold dilution series, transferred via select swab type and size to Copan universal transport medium, and tested with the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV assay. In addition to the viral cultures, a negative sample consisting of UTM was also evaluated. Overall, all swab types and sizes performed as expected generating $100 \%$ positivity for all evaluated target concentrations and $100 \%$ negativity for negative replicates.

# 3. Clinical studies:

The clinical performance of the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay was evaluated using nasopharyngeal swab specimens prospectively collected at four geographically diverse locations representing intended use sites during the course of two influenza seasons (2014-2015 and 2015-2016). For the 2014-2015 season, two U.S. sites and one Canadian site participated in this study. For the 2015-2016 season, clinical specimens were collected and tested at a total of four sites including one additional U.S. site.

A total of 2,504 subject specimens were collected in the prospective study. Of these, twenty-five specimens were excluded in the study (12 specimens were not nasopharyngeal swabs (e.g. BALs, nasal aspirates, throat swabs), seven specimens generated No Call results using the reference method upon re-test and six specimens were excluded based on the violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria or protocol deviation). The demographic information of the study participants who provided the 2,479 eligible specimens is presented below.

Of these 2,479 eligible specimens, 1,017 were collected during the 2014-2015 Flu season while the remaining 1,462 specimens were collected during the 2015-2016 Flu season. Out of the 2,479 clinical specimens, 2,458 (2458/2479; $9 9 . 2 \%$ ) generated valid results with ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay during initial testing. The overall invalid rate for the first-attempt testing was $0 . 8 \%$ (21/2479).

The performance of the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay was compared to an FDA-cleared multiplex molecular test for respiratory pathogens. Results are shown in three tables below. Discordant samples were further analyzed by bi-directional sequencing using analytically validated primers that targeted genomic regions distinct from the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay and subsequent results are documented in the footnotes.

a One ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay negative specimen that was positive by the reference method (i.e. False Negative) tested negative by bi-directional sequencing analysis using analytically validated primers that targeted genomic regions distinct from the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay.

b Thirty-two ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay positive specimens that were negative by the reference method (i.e. False Positive) tested positive by bi-directional sequencing analysis using analytically validated primers that targeted genomic regions distinct from the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay.

Due to the low prevalence of influenza B observed during the study season, the sample set was further supplemented with 40 banked (pre-selected) influenza B positive specimens. The 40 influenza B positive specimens were tested with the ARIES Flu A/B & RSV Assay along with 40 negative clinical specimens in a randomized, blinded fashion. The results from the supplement specimens were analyzed separately from those of the prospective data set. In this retrospective study, seventy-eight (78/80; $9 7 . 5 \%$ generated valid influenza B results on the first attempt. Upon repeat testing of two invalid specimens, they yielded valid results. The clinical performance for detection of influenza B in the retrospective study is summarized below.
