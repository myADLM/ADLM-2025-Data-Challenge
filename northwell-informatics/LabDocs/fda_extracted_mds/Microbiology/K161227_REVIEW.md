# I. Device Description:

The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2 test card contains 64 microwells. A control well containing only culture medium is included on all cards, with the remaining wells containing premeasured amounts of a specific antimicrobial agent in a culture medium base. A suspension of organism from a pure culture is prepared in a tube containing $0 . 4 5 – 0 . 5 \%$ sterile saline and standardized to a McFarland 0.5 using the DensiCHEK Plus. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills, seals and places the card into the incubator/reader; manual methods can also be used for the inoculation of test cards for use in the VITEK 2 System. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling and sealing operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time (up to 18 hours). At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.

VITEK 2 AST-GN Cefepime has the following concentrations in the card: 0.25, 1, 4, 16 and $3 2 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ ). The MIC result reporting range for the card is $\leq 0 . 1 2 - \geq 3 2 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

(AST) Systems

# L. Test Principle:

The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics used in the systems use visible light to directly measure organism growth. Transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through the well. The VITEK 2 System monitors the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time. An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a “rapid” read but may be extended to 18 hours in some instances. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antibiotic on the card.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A reproducibility study was conducted at three sites using ten isolates of gram negative bacilli that were consistent with the intended use. Isolates were tested in triplicate over three days for a total of 270 data points. The isolates tested in the reproducibility study included Klebsilla pneumoniae (three isolates), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two isolates), Enterobacter cloacae (two isolates), Serratia marcescens (two isolates), and $E .$ . coli (one isolate). Inocula were prepared using both manual and automatic dilution methods for testing in the VITEK 2. Inocula were prepared by the manual testing method only in the VITEK 2 Compact. The mode MIC value was determined and the reproducibility was calculated based on MIC values falling within $\pm \nobreakspace 1 \nobreakspace$ dilution of the mode MIC value.

Using VITEK 2 and automatic dilution, all results were on scale and the reproducibility was $100 \%$ .

Using VITEK 2 and manual dilution, there was one off-scale result. Reproducibility was at $9 9 . 6 \%$ for best an worst case scenarios.

Using VITEK 2 Compact and manual dilution, all results were on-scale and the reproducibility was $100 \%$

The reproducibility results were acceptable.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Inoculum Density Check: The inoculum density was monitored using the DensiCHEK Plus™ instrument. The DensiCHEK Plus™ was standardized daily with all results recorded and within expected range.

Purity Check: A purity check of all organisms was performed at the time of VITEK2 card inoculation. Only results obtained with pure cultures were evaluated.

Growth Failure Rate: There were two isolates that failed to grow in the clinical study. Complete test results were available for 822 isolates in a total of 824 clinical isolates. The growth failure rate was $0 . 2 \%$ and was acceptable.

Quality Control Testing: The FDA recommended QC organisms ( $E .$ . coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) were tested using both the VITEK 2 card and the reference method at each site. Both the automatic dilution and manual dilution methods were used for the VITEK 2 and the manual dilution method was used for the VITEK 2 Compact.

The expected range for $E .$ . coli ATCC 25922 with cefepime is $0 . 0 1 5 - 0 . 1 2 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . Even though the cefepime concentrations included in the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card are 0.25, 1, 4, 16 and $3 2 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ , the reporting range is ${ \underline { { < 0 . 1 2 } } } - { \underline { { > } } } 3 2$ $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . Therefore, all results for the QC strain $E$ . coli ATCC 25922 were off scale for the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems as both VITEK systems report the lowest end of the scale as $\leq 0 . 1 2 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ (Table 2). However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 was tested where the expected range is $0 . 5 \mathrm { - } 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ and all results were on-scale. All results were within the expected range.

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Results obtained with the bioMérieux VITEK 2 AST - Gram Negative card with cefepime were compared to results obtained with the CLSI broth microdilution reference panel. The VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card with cefepime contains the following concentrations of cefepime: 0.25, 1, 4, 16, and $3 2 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ ) and the reporting range is $\leq 0 . 1 2 - \geq 3 2 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ (i.e. ${ \underline { { - 0 . 1 2 5 } } }$ , 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and ${ \geq } 3 2$ ). The reference panel contained two-fold serial dilutions with a range of 0.008 to $1 2 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . The testing conditions for the reference method were:

• Medium: Mueller Hinton broth (Cation-Adjusted) with the appropriate dilutions of antimicrobial solution added   
• Inoculum: Direct colony suspension   
• Incubation: $3 5 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ ; 16- 20 hours

Test inocula were standardized using the DensiCHEK Plus instrument. VITEK 2 AST – Gram Negative cards were inoculated using automatic dilution (for reading on the VITEK 2 instrument) or using a manual dilution method (for reading on the VITEK 2 instrument or on the VITEK 2 COMPACT instrument). Reference panels were inoculated as outlined in the CLSI document M07-A10.

A total of 824 clinical isolates were evaluated at three external sites with VITEK 2 AST – Gram Negative cards inoculated by automatic dilution and interpreted using the VITEK 2 instrument. There were two isolates that failed to grow $( 9 9 . 8 \%$ growth rate). The majority of isolates were fresh (641 isolates, $7 8 . 0 \%$ ); 181 isolates $( 2 2 . 0 \% )$ were stock isolates. There were 531 Enterobacteriaceae and 291 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested in the clinical studies.

A total of 100 challenge isolates (80 Enterobacteriaceae and 20 Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were evaluated at one external site. The challenge set was tested with both automatic dilution and manual dilution methods on the VITEK 2 System and with the manual dilution method on the VITEK2 Compact System. The performance is provided in Table 3-A below:

Of the 20 major discrepancies, 17 were within essential agreement [i.e. VITEK 2: 16 (R), Reference: 8 (S)]. Of the four very major discrepancies, three were within essential agreement [i.e. VITEK 2: 8 (S), Reference: 16 (R)]. These 17 major and 3 very major discrepancies would have been considered minor discrepancies if there was an “intermediate” interpretation category for cefepime/P. aeruginosa.

Because of the lack of “intermediate” interpretation category, an adjustment was made in the overall performance evaluation of the discrepancy (error) rates by conducting an analysis to determine whether the MIC values for these isolates were within essential agreement or not.

As a result of this analysis, the adjusted major discrepancy rate for $P .$ . aeruginosa became $1 . 1 \%$ (3/268). The combined major discrepancy rate for Enterobacteriacea and $P .$ . aeruginosa became $0 . 5 \%$ (4/791). Similarly, the adjusted very major discrepancy rate for $P .$ . aeruginosa became $2 . 3 \%$ (1/43). The combined very major discrepancy rate for Enterobacteriacea and $P$ . aeruginosa became $1 . 6 \%$ (2/124). These performance data are acceptable based on the criteria outlined in the AST Special Controls guidance document.

The adjusted performance is noted in Tables 3-B and 3-C below:

† The acceptable number of discrepancies is 3 when 124 of resistant organisms are tested (Table 8, AST Special Controls Guidance)

The original $P .$ . aeruginosa performance with 20 major and 4 very discrepancies was mitigated by adding a limitation to address the need for repeat testing $P$ . aeruginosa by alternative methods when the VITEK 2 Systems MIC is $8 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ or $1 6 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . The limitation is noted below:

Although within Essential Agreement, the lack of an intermediate category has shown major and very major discrepancies when compared to the reference method. Testing should be repeated using an alternative testing/reference method prior to reporting results for the following antibiotic/organism:

Cefepime: Pseudomonas aeruginosa when the VITEK 2 MIC is 8μg/mL or 16μg/mL

For implementation of the repeat testing limitation, bioMerieux indicated that they will issue a customer communication requesting VITEK 2 uers to create a BioART rule stating the limitation in the VITEK 2 System for Pseudomonas aeruginosa when testing cefepime. Implementation of this BioART rule will assure that alternative testing is performed in accordance with the above limitation. The limitation will be included in the next software update release.

# ii. Essential Agreement

The essential agreement for $P _ { - }$ . aeruginosa in the comparative studies was lower than the acceptance criterion of $90 \%$ when analyzed separately. It was further evaluated by trending as demonstrated in Table 4 below:

The following footnote pertinent to cefepime is added to the VITEK 2 Performance Characteristics for Gram-Negative Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing Table (Table 127, Product Information Manual):

The EA for VITEK2 Cefepime with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was $8 8 . 4 \%$ . The trending of on-scale results demonstrated: $4 1 . 3 \%$ equivalent, $40 . 6 \%$ one doubling dilution higher, and $6 . 9 \%$ one doubling dilution lower when compared to the CLSI reference broth microdilution.

# Challenge

The challenge set of 80 Enterobacteriaceae and 20 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were evaluated with both automatic dilution and manual dilution methods on the VITEK 2 System and with the manual dilution method on the VITEK2 Compact System. The performance is shown in Table 5.
