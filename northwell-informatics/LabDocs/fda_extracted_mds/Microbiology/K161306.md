# Regulatory Information

Classification: 21 CFR§866.2560, Class I

Product Code(s): MDB

Predicate Device BD BACTEC Standard Anaerobic/F Culture Vials (K915796)

# Device Establishment

Becton Dickinson Caribe Ltd. Vicks Drive Lot #6   
Cayey, PR 00737   
Registration Number: 2647876

# Intended Use

BD BACTEC™ Standard Anaerobic/F culture vials (prereduced enriched Soybean-Casein Digest broth with CO2) are for anaerobic blood cultures. Principal use is with the BD BACTEC fluorescent series instruments for the qualitative culture and recovery of anaerobic microorganisms from blood.

# Device Description

The sample to be tested is inoculated into one or more vials which are inserted into the BD BACTEC fluorescent series instrument for incubation and periodic reading. Each vial contains a chemical sensor which can detect increases in $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ produced by the growth of microorganisms. The sensor is monitored by the instrument every ten minutes for an increase in its fluorescence, which is proportional to the amount of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ present. A positive reading indicates the presumptive presence of viable microorganisms in the vial. Detection is limited to microorganisms that will grow in a particular type of medium.

# Device Comparison

The BD BACTEC Standard Anaerobic/F Culture Vials (plastic) – modified device, differs from the BD BACTEC Standard Anaerobic/F Culture Vials (glass) – predicate device, in the following ways:

 The medium in the modified device is contained in a multilayer polycarbonate/ nylon/polycarbonate plastic bottle; whereas, the medium in the predicate device is contained in a glass bottle.

The modified device contains $2 . 6 \ \mathrm { g }$ of sensor per bottle; whereas, the predicate device contains $1 . 7 5 \ \mathrm { g }$ of sensor per bottle. $\bigcirc$ The volume of sensor has been adjusted for the plastic bottle to accommodate for differences in bottle geometry (thickness and shape) compared to the glass bottle.

 The indicator and red dye concentrations in the modified device have been increased to yield signals that are equivalent to the glass bottle.

$\bigcirc$ The bromocresol purple indicator (BCP) in the modified device’s sensor has been increased from a ratio of $1 . 8 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ per gram of sensor in the predicate device to a ratio of $6 . 5 \mathrm { m g }$ per gram of sensor in the modified device.   
o The radglo red dye in the modified device’s sensor has been increased from a ratio of 1.9 mg per gram of sensor in the predicate device to a ratio of $4 . 0 \mathrm { m g }$ per gram of sensor in the modified device.   
o The concentrations used in the plastic bottle accommodate for differences in overall sensor volume per bottle.

A clear, inert adhesion promoter has been added to the modified device’s sensor to ensure adhesion of the sensor to the polycarbonate surface of the plastic bottle. The glass surface of the predicate device does not require an adhesion promoter.

o The modified device’s sensor contains $1 3 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ per bottle of the adhesion promoter 3- glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane (GOP). This is not used in the predicate device.

 The modified device bottle weighs $2 0 . 9 \mathrm { g }$ compared to the predicate device bottle weight of $1 1 3 \mathrm { g }$  The modified device measures 5.0 inches high compared to the predicate device height of 5.6 inches.

# BD BACTEC Standard Anaerobic/F Culture Vials (plastic) – modified device, is similar to the BD BACTEC Standard Anaerobic/F Culture Vials (glass) – predicate device in the following ways:

Both the modified and predicate devices are used for the qualitative anaerobic culture and recovery of microorganisms from human blood.

Both devices are intended to be used with the BD BACTEC fluorescent-series of blood culture instruments.

The BD BACTEC fluorescent-series of blood culture instruments apply the same incubation and agitation parameters to both devices.

The BD BACTEC fluorescent-series of blood culture instruments apply the same growth and detection algorithms to both devices.

Both devices are incubated at $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \left( \pm 1 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \right)$ for a period of up to 120 hours.

Both devices incorporate a sensor that detects increases in $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ within the bottle as a result of organism growth.

 Both devices require a sample volume of $3 . 0 { - } 7 . 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of blood.

Both devices utilize the same formulation of enriched soybean casein digest broth as the growth medium.

# Analytical Studies

# Instrument time to Detection

A total of 443 paired sets were positive in both the modified and predicate devices. The Wilcoxon estimated median TTD difference for the 443 positive sets is -0.500 hours (30 minutes), favoring the modified device. The data indicates that the effect of differences between the modified and predicate devices on TTD under these test conditions was minimal and that the modified device performs equivalently to the predicate device. The modified device meets the acceptance criteria of “No relevant difference from the predicate device.”

# Percent Recovery

Recovery was equivalent between the modified and predicate devices. A total of 528paired sets were evaluated in the Percent Recovery comparison. Of those, 504 paired sets were positive in both the modified and predicate devices at inoculum level 10-100CFU. The McNemar p-value for this data could not be calculated given that neither device showed detection exclusively.

# Microbial Detection Limit

A total of 312 paired sets were inoculated, of this group 191 grew and detected in both the modified and predicate devices. Thirty-six cultures grew and detected in the predicate device only. Thirty -nine cultures grew and detected in the modified device only. There were forty –six paired sets that were not detected in either the modified or predicate devices. The McNemar chi-square analysis of the data indicates that there was no statistically significant difference in recovery $\scriptstyle \mathbf { p } = 0 . 8 1 7 4$ ) between the modified and predicate devices.

# False Positive Rate

A total of 240 paired sets were used to execute this study. The 240 paired sets were comprised of 40 paired sets from each of 3 lots. The paired sets were inoculated with fresh human blood at varying levels as specified by the test protocol and entered into the BACTEC blood culture instrument. Each bottle is expected to be instrument-negative following the complete protocol (120 hours). There were no false positive bottles for the modified device observed with blood volumes (2, 4, 6, 8, and $1 0 \mathrm { m L }$ ).

# False Negative Rate

A total of 70 paired sets were end of protocol negative in the modified and predicate devices and were evaluated for the determination of the False Negative Rate. There were 36 modified device only instrument negative bottles evaluated by terminal subculture and 39 predicate device only instrument negatives evaluated by terminal subculture .There was a total of 1 false negative observation. The 1 false negative was found in the predicate device. The McNemar chi-square analysis of the data indicates that there was no statistically significant difference in recovery $( \mathsf { p } { = } 1 . 0 0 )$ between the modified and predicate devices.

# Reproducibility

The modified device was evaluated for reproducibility across lots in terms of time to detection and recovery. There was no relevant difference in time to detection observed between lot comparisons.
