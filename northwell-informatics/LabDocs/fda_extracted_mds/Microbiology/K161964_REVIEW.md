# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

ADVIA Centaur, ADVIA Centaur XP, and ADVIA Centaur XPT systems:

The ADVIA Centaur ${ } ^ { \textregistered } \mathrm { H A V  I g M }$ (aHAVM) assay is an in vitro diagnostic immunoassay for the qualitative determination of IgM response to the hepatitis A virus (HAV) in human pediatric (2 through 21 years) and adult serum or plasma (potassium EDTA, lithium or sodium heparinized) using the ADVIA Centaur, ADVIA Centaur XP, and ADVIA Centaur XPT systems. This assay is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of acute or recent infection (usually 6 months or less) with hepatitis A virus.

Assay performance characteristics have not been established for immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patients, cord blood, or patients less than 2 years of age.

# ADVIA Centaur CP system:

The ADVIA Centaur ${ } ^ { \textregistered } \mathrm { H A V \ I g M }$ (aHAVM) assay is an in vitro diagnostic immunoassay for the qualitative determination of IgM response to the hepatitis A virus (HAV) in human pediatric (2 through 21 years) and adult serum or plasma (potassium EDTA,

lithium or sodium heparinized) using the ADVIA Centaur CP system. This assay is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of acute or recent infection (usually 6 months or less) with hepatitis A virus.

Assay performance characteristics have not been established for immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patients, cord blood, or patients less than 2 years of age.

2. Indication(s) for use: Same as Intended Use

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only.

4. Special instrument requirements: ADVIA Centaur, ADVIA Centaur XP, ADVIA Centaur XPT, or ADVIA Centaur CP system.

# I. Device Description:

The ADVIA Centaur HAV IgM assay is an IgM capture immunoassay. In the first step, the sample is diluted using Multi-Diluent 2. After sample dilution, biotinylated anti-human IgM monoclonal antibody is added to the cuvette binding lgM from the diluted patient sample. The $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { l g } } \boldsymbol { \mathrm { M } }$ complex is then captured by the addition of streptavidin coated magnetic latex particles (MLP). The lgM-MLP is washed and resuspended. The anti-HAV lgM captured on the Solid Phase is then detected by the sequential addition of HAV antigen and acridinium ester-labeled mouse anti-HAV antibody.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Pediatric Patient Testing: The following comparison study was performed to demonstrate that the pediatric population can be used in the ADVIA Centaur HAV IgM assay. One hundred and thirty-two (132) pediatric serum samples (male and female, age range from 2 to 21 years), from suspected positive or high risk population were evaluated with the ADVIA Centaur HAV IgM assay and another commercially available assay. The percent agreement results are shown in the following table:
