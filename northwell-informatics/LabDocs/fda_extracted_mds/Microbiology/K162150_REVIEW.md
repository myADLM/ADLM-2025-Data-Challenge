# L. Test Principle:

The Exalenz BreathID® Hp System non-invasive breath test is a diagnostic test that analyzes a breath sample before and after ingestion of $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C }$ -enriched urea; it is used to identify those patients with $H .$ pylori infection. The Exalenz BreathID® Hp System breath test is performed as follows: a $7 5 \ : \mathrm { { \dot { m g } } ^ { 1 3 } C }$ -urea tablet and $4 . 3 \ \mathrm { g }$ Citrica Powder are dissolved in water, and the resulting solution is ingested by the patient. The presence of the Citrica creates an acidic environment in the stomach and also delays the transfer of the ingested solution to the duodenum. These two characteristics facilitate the decomposition of the urea by H. pylori, if present. Thus, in the presence of urease associated with gastric $H .$ pylori, $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C }$ -urea is decomposed to $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 } ^ { \cdot }$ and $\mathrm { N H } _ { 3 }$ according to the following equation:

H. pylori urease

$$
2 \ ^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C - u r e a } + 2 \ \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } \qquad \qquad 2 \ ^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 } + 2 \ \mathrm { N H } _ { 3 }
$$

The $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ is absorbed into the blood and then exhaled in the breath. Absorption and distribution of $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ is fast. Therefore, the cleavage of urea by the $H .$ pylori urease that produces the $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ occurs immediately after the solution is ingested and enables immediate detection of increased $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ in the exhaled breath of $H .$ pylori-positive patients.

In the case of $H .$ . pylori-negative patients, the $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C }$ -urea does not produce $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ in the stomach because there are no human enzymes that can metabolize the urea in the stomach.

The BreathID Hp Lab System consists of the BreathID Hp Device, an Auto Sampler, and the computer based BreathID Hp Lab application with a Work Station. In addition, the BreathID Hp Lab System is used with the IDkit: $\mathrm { H } \mathrm { p } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ TWO test kit. The subject system enables sample collection into breath sample bags, instead of using a nasal cannula. Breath sample bag collection enables off site and deferred testing as compared to on-line measurement when using the nasal cannula. The BreathID Hp Lab System with the IDkit:Hp™ TWO test kit enables testing of multiple breath sample bags sequentially using the Auto Sampler. A maximum of ten pairs of bags (Baseline and Post Ingestion) can be attached to the Auto Sampler in 20 ports, for measurement on the BreathID $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Hp Device. The Lab Application controls the automated process and presents the results.

Patients first fill a Baseline Breath Sample Bag with their breath prior to ingestion of the $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C } .$ - urea test drink, and then fill a Post-Ingestion Breath Sample Bag 15 minutes after ingestion. The bags are color-coded to mitigate the risk of mixing-up the patient samples collected before and after consuming the test drink. One (1) DOB measurement detecting the change in the $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 } / ^ { 1 2 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ ratio is sufficient since the Post-Ingestion Breath Sample Bag contains breath collected 15 minutes after consumption of the test drink.

Immediately following the conclusion of the test, the system prints a summary of the test results.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility

Analytical studies were conducted to evaluate the reproducibility and precision of the BreathID® Hp Lab System with different operators, instruments, days, and sites. The studies used samples stored up to 14 days at different temperature and humidity conditions.

Three gas isotope pairs were used with Delta Over Baseline (DOB) values of 3.3 (high negative), 6.4 (low positive), and 15.5 (moderate positive). Two operators were asked to operate each of three BreathID® Hp Lab Systems at three different sites for five days to measure the DOB values for samples from each of the three sample pairs. The results demonstrated that the standard deviation and overall reproducibility were stable over different samples for both the operator, the devices and between days. The reproducibility standard deviation was 0.65 or less for all samples, and the between days, devices and operators standard deviation was 0.66 or less in all cases, which is less than the natural variability of the DOB measurement. Table 1 summarizes the results of the reproducibility study.

# Precision (Repeatability)

Three gas isotope pairs were used with DOB values of 3.3 (high negative), 6.4 (low positive), and 15.5 (moderate positive). The DOB values for each of the samples were measured on the BreathID® Hp Lab System twice a day for 12 days. The results demonstrated that the standard deviation and overall repeatability were stable over different samples and different days. The repeatability standard deviation was 0.64 or less and the overall between days standard deviation was 0.72 or less, which is less than the natural variability of the DOB measurement.

Stability of breath sample bags

An analytical study was conducted to evaluate the stability of breath sample bags at the maximum limits of the recommended storage times and conditions. One gas isotope pair was used in a bench study. Pairs of breath sample bags with a DOB value of 3.3 were stored at two different storage conditions representing the two extreme temperatures of the recommended storage range, $1 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and at the high limit of the recommended relative humidity (RH), $70 \%$ . The DOB values for samples from each storage condition were measured on the BreathID® Hp Lab System seven times during 14 consecutive days for each storage condition, on days 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 14. The results demonstrated that the standard deviation and overall repeatability were stable over different samples, different days and different storage conditions. The overall repeatability standard deviation and the between days precision standard deviation were 0.60 or less, which is less than the natural variability of the DOB measurement. Table 3 summarizes the results of the breath sample bags stability study.

Carry-over testing

A study was conducted to evaluate the potential for sample to sample carry-over or cross contamination in the BreathID Hp Lab system. Twenty runs were conducted using the sequence recommended in CLSI EP10 using contrived gas, each run consisting of 10 tests. Data from tests 2-10 in each run were used in the analysis as instructed in CLSI EPl0. The acceptance criteria were as follows:

# Accuracy

For measurement range 0-5 DOB: $\pm 1 . 0$

For measurement range 5 DOB and up: $\pm 2 0 \%$ of the expected result Precision

Standard deviation: $\pm 1 . 0$ DOB

The allowable bias and imprecision $( \mathrm { C V \% }$ , coefficient of variation) for each gas level were derived from these requirements:

Allowable bias:

For low level $\mathrm { ( D O B } = 3$ ): $\pm 1 . 0$ For mid-level $( \mathrm { D O B } = 9 $ ): $\pm 2 0 \%$ x 9 = 1.8 For high level $( \mathrm { D O B } = 1 5 $ ): $\pm 2 0 \% \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 5 = 3$

Allowable imprecision $( \mathrm { C V \% } )$ :

The coefficient of variation is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. For calculating $C V \%$ limit, the allowable standard deviation of the system (1.0) was divided by the expected DOB result.

For the low level: $- 3 0 \%$ For mid-level: - $1 1 \%$ For the high level: - $6 . 5 \%$

A multi-center, non-randomized, open label, validation, pivotal study was conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the IDkit $\mathrm { H } \mathrm { p } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Two as part of the BreathID® Hp Lab System for initial diagnosis and post eradication testing versus composite biopsy results (histology and RUT or culture). The study used the 5 DOB diagnostic cut-off.

Patients were asked to produce two pairs of breath samples with bags from the IDkit $\mathrm { H } \mathrm { p } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Two, and the sample analysis was performed either on site or in a remote location using a BreathID® Hp Lab System.

The study was conducted at 11 United States clinical sites and two sites in Israel. A total of 189 adult initial diagnosis patients and 68 post–therapy patients were enrolled. Post-therapy patients were positive for infection had completed eradication therapy at least six weeks prior to participation in the study.

Patients were evaluated by at least three diagnostic methods:

1. Histopathology: Biopsy specimens, fixed with formalin, were cut into sections, stained with at least H&E and IHC stains, and examined by an experienced pathologist at a central laboratory.   
2. Rapid Urease Test (RUT): Biopsy specimens were tested for urease activity with a FDA-cleared test according to the instructions in its package insert.   
3. Exalenz BreathID® Hp Lab test: The Exalenz BreathID® Hp Lab test was performed in accordance with the procedures described in the IDkit: $\mathrm { H } \mathrm { p } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Two package insert.

Stability of clinical breath samples

To further demonstrate the stability of breath samples after storage over time in the breath sample collection bags, 191 initial diagnosis patients were asked to perform the urea breath test using two sets of IDkit $\mathrm { H } \mathrm { p } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Two test kit. The sample analysis was performed either on-site or in a remote location using a BreathID® Hp Lab System. Each pair of breath sample bags was analyzed at a different time point up to 14 days apart in order to assess the stability of the breath samples in the bags. A total of 191 subjects produced two results that were evaluable for analysis. Out of 45 samples positive on the first measurement, 44 remained positive on the second measurement (Percent Positive Agreement: $9 7 . 8 \%$ $[ 9 5 \%$ CI (88.43, 99.61)]). Out of 146 samples negative on the first measurement, all 146 remained negative on the second measurement (Percent Negative Agreement: $100 \%$ $[ 9 5 \%$ CI (97.44, 100)])

3. Specimen Identification: Specimens IDs can be entered in manually or through a barcode reader.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Specimens for the BreathID Hp Lab System acquires breath exhaled through the mouth into the breath collection bags (IDkit Hp Two test kit) before and after taking the $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C } .$ - enriched urea substrate. Specimens collected in bags can be measured up to 14 days from the moment the bags were filled with patient-exhaled breath.

Updates for the Exalenz BreathID Hp Lab System include an Auto Sampler with its embedded software and the BreathIDLab Application with its Work Station, which permits the automated consecutive batch measurement of up to 10 pairs of breath bags (before and after ingestion of $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C }$ -enriched urea).

5. Calibration:

Calibration is performed by the instrument with five gas samples of known concentration and isotope ratio are used to adjust the absorption cell calibration curves, aiming to attain identical isotope ratios over the collection range of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ concentrations. This will ensure accurate readings in both negative and positive samples. The device uses these five concentrations to determine the systematic error of the system and to ensure that the estimated systematic error is below a specified value. If the systematic error is not below the specified value, the device prompts the user to contact Exalenz for repair or replacement.

# 6. Quality Control:

To ensure correct functioning of the BreathID Hp Lab System in the field, a self test is required every 75 breath tests. BreathID Hp Lab System will automatically perform a self test after 75 tests are completed, during the baseline measurement phase of the next patient test. This procedure confirms that the BreathID Hp Lab System is functional and is performing within specifications.
