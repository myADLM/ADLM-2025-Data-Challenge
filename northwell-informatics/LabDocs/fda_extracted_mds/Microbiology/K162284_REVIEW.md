Cary-Blair medium is a non-nutritive balanced salt solution containing disodium phosphate to provide buffering capability, sodium chloride and calcium chloride to provide essential ions that help maintain osmotic balance. Agar is used to increase the viscosity of the medium. Sodium thioglycollate and L-cysteine helps maintain an oxygen-reduced environment to help maintain the viability of enteric bacteria during the transport to the laboratory.

The liquid modified Cary Blair medium is composed of the following components:

· Sodium chloride · Disodium Phosphate · Sodium thioglycollate · Calcium chloride

L-cysteine · Bacteriological agar Deionized water

# L. Test Principle:

Not applicable.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# 1. Analytical performance:

The performance of the Puritan Fecal Opti-Swab Collection and Transport System was determined using roll plate and swab elution techniques outlined in the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M40-A2 document. Bacterial viability studies were performed. The swabs from each transport system were inoculated with a specified volume of bacterial concentrations prepared in a fecal matrix and/or $0 . 8 5 \%$ phosphate buffered saline (PBS). A select group of organisms were also tested in a fecal matrix (See Table 1). Fecal matrix was made by diluting pre-screened negative fresh clinical fecal material in $0 . 8 5 \%$ PBS to a $30 \%$ concentration by volume.

These swabs were then placed in their respective transport tubes and held at various time intervals; at the designated time intervals the swabs were removed and processed. To test the viability at various time intervals the inoculated swabs were held at room temperature for 0, 24, and 48 hours and refrigerated for 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours.

The nine ATCC strains listed in Table 1 below were used in this study to evaluate the performance of the Puritan Fecal Opti-Swab Collection and Transport System. This device was tested using the swabs included with the transport kit. Viability studies were conducted in duplicate at 0, 24, and 48 at room temperature $( 2 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours at refrigerated temperatures $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ using the Roll-Plate and Swab Elution Methods for all strains except $C .$ . difficile. For $C .$ . difficile, viability studies were conducted in duplicate at 0 and 48 at room temperature $( 2 0 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and at 0, 24 and 48 hours at refrigerated temperatures $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ using the Roll-Plate and Swab Elution Methods.

\* ‘NO’ indicates that strain was not tested in the column heading matrix; ‘YES’ indicates that the strain was tested in the column heading matrix.

# Roll-Plate Method:

Bacterial suspensions were prepared from fresh18-24 hour cultures of each microorganism in a separate vial containing $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of $0 . 8 5 \%$ sterile saline to obtain $1 . 5 \mathrm { x }$ $1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ suspensions. A select group of organisms were also tested in a separate vial containing $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ fecal matrix. One $\log _ { 1 0 }$ serial dilutions were made and $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ aliquots of dilutions were absorbed into the swabs and immediately placed into the Puritan Fecal Opti-Swab Collection and Transport System. For fecal specimens, the final dilution prior to swab inoculation was done with fecal matrix to maximize the amount of fecal material on the swab.

After incubation at each time point, the swabs were removed from the transport tubes and used to inoculate the entire surface of the appropriate agar plate. The plates were incubated in appropriate culture conditions for 24-48 hours or until countable colonies were visible. Manual colony counts were conducted for each time interval for each swaborganism combination. The dilution yielding colony counts within the countable tolerance zone (approximately between 25 and 250 colonies) was reported. Log10 increases or decreases in survival are based on a comparison between time-zero and the last time point collected for each temperature.

# Swab Elution Method:

Bacterial suspensions were prepared from fresh18-24 hour cultures of each microorganism in a separate vial containing $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of fecal matrix or $0 . 8 5 \%$ sterile saline to obtain $1 . 5 \mathrm { { x } 1 0 ^ { 8 } } \mathrm { { C F U / m L } }$ suspensions. The suspensions were diluted in $0 . 8 5 \%$ saline or fecal matrix solution to obtain working suspensions of $1 . 5 \mathrm { { x } 1 0 ^ { 7 } C F U / m l }$ , and then 100 $\mu \mathrm { L }$ aliquots of dilutions were absorbed into the swabs and immediately placed into the Puritan Fecal Opti-Swab Collection and Transport System medium. After incubation at each time point, the swabs were removed from the transport tubes and $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of $\boldsymbol { 1 - } \mathrm { l o g } _ { 1 0 }$ serial dilutions were made in $0 . 8 5 \%$ saline. $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of each dilution was plated on the appropriate agar plate for each temperature and time point. The plates were incubated in appropriate culture conditions for 24-48 hours or until countable colonies were visible. Manual colony counts were conducted for each time interval for each swab-organism combination. The dilution yielding zero-time colony counts approximately between 25 and 250 CFU was reported.

Results from the Roll Plate and Swab Elution experiments as determined at various storage times and temperature ranges are shown in Tables 2-9 below.

Acceptance criteria for recovery of microorganisms is defined as being within one $\log _ { 1 0 }$ increase or decrease from the starting titer at time zero. Manual colony counts were conducted for each of the time intervals for each microorganism held at each temperature.

These results demonstrate that the pre-defined acceptance criteria were met for each bacterial strain tested by both the Roll-Plate and Swab Elution Methods. Those results are described in labeling.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Not applicable.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable.   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Shelf-life Stability: Shelf life stability test were performed successfully on three lots of product demonstrating stability for up to 15 months at room temperature. Recovery of microorganisms from fecal matrix was assessed by the Roll Plate method, as described in M.1 above.

pH Stability: The pH of the test device was measured at predetermined time intervals up to 20 months after manufacturing date. The test was performed using calibrated $\mathsf { p H }$ meter with random samples from three different lots of Puritan Fecal Opti-Swab Collection and Transport System. All samples tested were found to maintain pH within the specified range of $\mathrm { p H } 6 . 9 0 $ to 7.50.

Cytotoxicity: Cytotoxicity test was conducted to evaluate glue, shaft and the rayon tipped swabs for potential cytotoxicity effect following ISO Elution Method-1X MEM Extract. No evidence of cytotoxicity was detected.

Sterilization: Puritan Fecal Opti-Swab Collection and Transport System are sterilized by gamma irradiation and validated following ANSI/AAMI/ISO 11137:2006, Sterilization of health care products Radiation guidelines.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable.   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable.   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable.

b. Matrix comparison:

Not applicable.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable.   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable.   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range: Not applicable.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
