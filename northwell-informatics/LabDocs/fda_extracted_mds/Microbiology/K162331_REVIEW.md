# 1. Intended Use(s):

The Cepheid Xpert® Xpress Flu/RSV Assay, performed on the GeneXpert® Instrument Systems, is an automated, multiplex real-time, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay intended for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) viral RNA. The Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay uses nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens collected from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infections in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus or RSV infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.

Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2015- 2016 influenza season. When other novel influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $3 +$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

# I. Device Description:

# 1. Overview

The Xpert® Xpress Flu/RSV Assay, performed on the GeneXpert® Instrument (Dx and Infinity) Systems, is a rapid, multiplex nucleic acid amplification test for the qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV viral RNA from NP swab specimens.

To perform the Xpert® Xpress Flu/RSV Assay, NP swab specimens are collected from patients and placed into viral transport medium using the Xpert® Xpress Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit for Viruses. With a transfer pipette, eluted NP swab specimens are loaded into the sample chamber of a single-use, self-contained Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay cartridge. Each assay cartridge contains separate chambers for sample loading, sample processing and target amplification by real-time RT-PCR, and contains all the reagents necessary to carry out these processes. Because the cartridges are self-contained, and specimens never contact working parts of the instrument modules, crosscontamination between samples is minimized.

The assay cartridge containing the patient sample is inserted into the GeneXpert Instrument System, which performs fully automated and integrated sample preparation and real-time RT-PCR for the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay in approximately 30 minutes or less. The GeneXpert Instrument Systems, comprised of the GeneXpert Dx and GeneXpert Infinity Systems, have one to 80 randomly accessible modules that are each capable of performing separate sample preparation and real-time PCR and RT-PCR tests. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids (i.e., the syringe drive activates the plunger that works in concert with the rotary valve in the cartridge to move fluids between chambers), an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or spores, and a proprietary I-CORE® thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and RT-PCR detection.

After completion of the test, the assay results are interpreted by the GeneXpert software from measured fluorescent signals and embedded calculation algorithms, and are shown in the “View Results” window in tabular and graphic formats.

# 2. Materials Provided

The Xpert® Xpress Flu/RSV Assay (Cat # XPRSFLU/RSV-10) contains sufficient reagents to process $1 0 \mathrm { N P }$ swab specimens or quality control samples. The assay kit includes 10 individual cartridges with integrated reaction tubes that hold all of the reagents necessary for sample lysis, RNA extraction, and nucleic acid amplification. Additionally, each kit includes a set of 12 transfer pipettes for loading samples into the assay cartridge and a CD containing the Assay Definition Files (ADFs) with instructions for importing ADFs into the GeneXpert software.

3. Materials Required but Not Provided

# Validated Specimen Collection and Transport Kit

Cepheid Xpert® Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit for Viruses (Cat # SWAB/B100) containing one individually wrapped, sterile nasopharyngeal flocked nylon swab and one Xpert Viral Transport Medium tube with three mL of Xpert Viral Transport Medium.

# GeneXpert $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Instrument System

GeneXpert Dx System (GX-I, GX-II, GX-IV, GX-XVI) Gene Xpert Infinity System (Infinity-48, Infinity-48s, Infinity-80)

# External Controls

· Positive inactivated influenza A and B virus control from ZeptoMetrix (Cat # NATFLUA/B-6C)   
Positive inactivated respiratory syncytial virus control from ZeptoMetrix (Cat # NATRSV-6C) Negative inactivated coxsackievirus control from ZeptoMetrix (Cat # NATCXVA9-6C)

# 4. Quality Control

The Xpert® Xpress Flu/RSV Assay includes two internal controls: a sample processing control, and a probe check control.

# Sample Processing Control

The sample processing control (SPC) is a non-infectious armored RNA pseudovirus that ensures adequate processing of target viruses, monitors the presence of PCR inhibitors, and verifies the use of proper PCR conditions. The SPC should be POSITIVE in a sample that is negative for all three influenza A, influenza B and RSV target analytes, and can be NEGATIVE or POSITIVE in a sample containing detectable levels of one or more of the target analytes.

# Probe Check Control

The probe check control (PCC) is present to control for sufficient reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling, probe integrity and dye stability. All assay reagents must be present and intact for the PCC to pass the validated acceptance criteria. If any of the PCC conditions fail, the result is reported as an ERROR and the test must be repeated using a new assay cartridge.

# 5. Results Interpretation

POSITIVE or NEGATIVE test results for influenza A (Flu A), influenza B (Flu B), and RSV viral RNA are automatically generated by the GeneXpert software and presented as text in the “View Results” window of the GeneXpert Instrument Systems following completion of the test. The GeneXpert software is equipped with embedded algorithms to determine the result of the test based on the calculated cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained for each of the RNA target-specific optical curves generated by fluorescent probes during the real-time PCR cycling process. Optical curves for each of the RNA targets are also displayed in the “View Results” window but do not require manual data interpretation or reviewing.

The Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay uses two separate channels for the detection of influenza A viral RNA (Flu A 1 and Flu A 2). The primers and probes in the Flu A 1 channel have $100 \%$ homology to human influenza A strains. The primers and probes in the Flu A 2 channel have $> 9 5 \%$ homology to avian influenza A strains and approximately $80 \%$ homology to human influenza A strains. Detection of influenza A strains in either the Flu A 1 or Flu A 2 channel is reported as Flu A POSITIVE.

The GeneXpert Instrument Systems software also reports if the test is INVALID, encounters an ERROR, or produces NO RESULT.

If any of the test results mentioned below occur, the test should be repeated using leftover specimen from the original transport medium tube and a new assay cartridge.

INVALID: indicates that the control SPC failed. The sample was not properly processed, PCR was inhibited, or the sample was not properly collected. ERROR: could be a result of PCC failure or that the maximum pressure limits were exceeded. PCR does not initiate when there is a PCC failure. NO RESULT: indicates that insufficient data were collected. For example, the operator stopped a test that was in progress or a power failure occurred. · Co-infection with two or more viruses: the incidence of co-infection with influenza A, influenza B and RSV is low. Specimens should undergo repeat testing if nucleic acids from two or more analytes are detected in a single specimen.

# L. Test Principle:

The Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay performed on the GeneXpert Instrument platform utilizes automated real-time RT-PCR for unique gene-specific sequence amplification and $5 ^ { \circ }$ end cleavage of hybridized, fluorogenic target-specific probe for the detection of influenza A, influenza B and RSV viral RNA. Specific gene targets of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay primers and probes include the matrix protein (M), basic polymerase protein 2 (PB2), and polymerase acidic protein (PA) of influenza A viruses; the matrix protein (M) and nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NS2) of influenza B viruses; and the nucleocapsid protein of

RSV A and B viruses. Additional assay primers generate amplicons for the SPC.

The GeneXpert Instrument Systems automates sample preparation, amplification and realtime detection of target-specific cDNA from clinical specimens. Each system utilizes a syringe pump drive to dispense fluids to and from the different cartridge chambers and ultrasonic lysis to release nucleic acids from both the target organisms and integrated SPC. During the amplification process, the $\mathrm { I - C O R E } ^ { \mathbb { \ B } }$ module contained within the GeneXpert Instrument systems heats and cools the reaction tube contents, and detects emitted fluorescence generated in the presence of target sequences. Embedded data analysis algorithms within the GeneXpert Instrument software generate test results based on the calculated cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained for each of the RNA target-specific optical curves generated by fluorescent probes during the real-time PCR cycling process. The time to results is 30 minutes or less.

# M. Performance Characteristics

1. Analytical Performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility

A blinded, multi-center reproducibility study was conducted to assess the total variability of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay across operators, study sites, testing days, GeneXpert Instrument systems, runs, and reagent lots.

Two operators at three study sites tested a seven-member reproducibility panel in duplicate twice per day on six different days (2 operators x 3 sites x 7 panel members x 2 replicates x 2 runs x 6 days) for a total of 1008 runs. Each site used a different GeneXpert Instrument (Infinity-80, GeneXpert Dx, or Infinity-48) and three Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV reagent lots for the analysis. The reproducibility specimen panel consisted of one seasonal influenza A strain (Flu A/Victoria/361/2011), one influenza B strain (Flu B/Massachusetts/2/2012), and one RSV (A/Long/MD/56) strain. Each virus strain was prepared at two concentration levels: a “low positive” sample with an analyte concentration approximately 1X the limit of detection (LoD) and a “moderate positive” sample with an analyte concentration approximately 2X the LoD.

The reproducibility panel specimens were prepared using cultured influenza and RSV viruses spiked into negative simulated nasal matrix. The simulated matrix consisted of $2 . 5 \%$ (w/v) porcine mucin, $1 \% \mathrm { ~ ( v / v ) ~ }$ human whole blood in $0 . 8 5 \%$ sodium chloride (NaCl) formulated in a 1X PBS solution with $1 5 \%$ glycerol, which was then diluted in UTM to a final concentration of $1 6 . 7 \%$ . A negative sample containing simulated matrix only was also included in the panel.

The expected results for each of the panel members are shown in Table 4 below. Overall percent agreement between the expected results and the reproducibility study results is presented in Table 5. Analysis of variance (CV) between sites, days, lots and operators for each reproducibility panel member is presented in Table 6.

a Results with non-zero Ct values of 144.

# b. Assay Cut-Off

The Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay detects influenza A (Flu A), influenza B (Flu B) and RSV analytes. For each analyte, a manual threshold and a valid minimum and maximum cycle threshold (Ct) setting are defined. The manual threshold setting is the relative fluorescence value that, when exceeded, results in a reported Ct value. The manual threshold is chosen as low as possible to preserve assay sensitivity, but high enough to insure that noise values in the baseline do not trigger a threshold crossing erroneously.

The manual threshold setting for the Flu A 1 target was set at 40 based on a mean fluorescent background level of 232.4 in pre-clinical and analytical studies. The manual threshold settings for the Flu A 2, Flu B, and RSV targets were 50 (mean $= 1 4 0 . 7 )$ ), 40 (mean $= 2 5 6 . 9 $ ) and 45 (mean $= 2 8 8 . 0$ ), respectively.

The valid $\mathrm { C t }$ range for Flu A1, Flu A2, Flu B, and RSV targets is 10 to 40. These values were determined using pre-clinical and analytical data and were subsequently validated in the clinical study. The Ct cutoffs are included as automatic calculations in the assay definition file (ADF) provided with the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay.

# c. External Controls

Three Zeptrometrix NATtrol Molecular Controls, comprised of inactivated viruses in a purified protein matrix, were evaluated as external controls with the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay.

Testing was performed with 20 replicates of three separate lots of the NATtrol Influenza A/B Positive Control (cat # NATFLUA/B-6C), NatTrol RSV Positive Control (Cat # NATRSV-6C), and NATtrol Influenza/RSV Negative Control (cat# NATCXVA9-C6C), totaling 180 runs. All 180 runs provided valid and accurate test results.

For all analytical studies reported in this submission, one replicate of the three external controls was run with the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay on each day of testing.

# d. Stability

# Kit Stability

Real-time kit stability data for the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay is currently available for six months at the extremes of the recommended storage temperature range of $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $2 8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Results to date show that average Ct values from the stability testing meet the predefined performance criteria. Testing is ongoing for up to 37 months on three reagent lots.

# Specimen Stability

A stability study was conducted to establish transport and storage claims for eluted NP swab specimens to be analyzed with the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay. Specimens included one seasonal influenza A strain (A/Victoria/361/2011), one influenza B strain (B/Massachusetts/2/2012), and one RSV strain (A/Long/MD/56) prepared in simulated matrix to an analyte concentration of approximately 2X LoD.

Eight replicates of each of the positive specimens and a negative control (simulated matrix only) were stored at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , $1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and tested at multiple time points. Under the conditions of the study, all positive and negative specimens at all storage conditions and temperatures tested were correctly identified using the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay. The study data supports specimen stability claims under the recommended specimen storage conditions ( $1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 24 hours and $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to seven days).

# Cartridge Hold Time

Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV samples that are prepared for testing may wait up to four and a half hours on the GeneXpert Infinity Instruments before a module becomes available. During this wait time, targeted viral RNA may degrade or become unstable such that an originally low positive sample is rendered “NEGATIVE.” Assay performance out to five and a half hours was evaluated under three storage conditions (ambient, $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 7 5 \%$ relative humidity (RH), and $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) with a single lot of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay. Testing was performed on eight replicates each of one influenza A (A/Victoria/361/2011), one influenza B (B/Massachusetts/2/2012), and one RSV (A/Long/MD/56) strain spiked into negative simulated matrix at an analyte concentration between 1X and 3X the LoD, and negative specimens consisting of simulated matrix

only. All positive and negative replicates were correctly reported using the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay, demonstrating acceptable performance following incubation for periods exceeding the maximum cartridge hold time of four and half hours.

# e. Limit of Detection

The LoD of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay was established using two influenza A 2009 H1N1-like strains, two influenza A H3N2 strains, two influenza B strains, two RSV A strains, and two RSV B strains diluted into negative pooled NP clinical matrix. The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration (tissue culture infectious does, $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ ) per sample that can be reproducibly distinguished from negative samples with $9 5 \%$ confidence or the lowest concentration at which 19 of 20 replicates were positive.

Each virus strain was initially tested in a range finding study at five different concentrations in replicates of 20 per concentration of virus. Testing was performed with two lots of reagents across three testing days. The higher LoD estimate observed per strain and per lot as determined by probit regression analysis was selected for verification. Verification of the estimated LoD claim was performed on one reagent lot across a minimum of three testing days using 20 replicates per strain.

The LoD study results are presented in Tables 7 to 11.

An analytical reactivity study was conducted to evaluate the ability of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay to detect multiple influenza and RSV strains that are temporally and geographically diverse. Testing was performed on 53 different strains (48 influenza and 5 RSV) in triplicate using cultured virus spiked into negative simulated matrix at analyte concentrations approximately 3X the LoD. Influenza A strains included 14 A/H1N1 (pre-2009 seasonal and 2009 pandemic), 9 A/H3N2, and 12 avian strains (H5N1, H5N2, H6N2, H7N2, H2N2, H7N9, and H9N2 subtypes). The 13 Influenza B strains included both the Victoria and Yamagata lineage. RSV strains included RSV types A and B.

The Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay exhibited a broad range of reactivity, as all influenza A, influenza B and RSV strains tested positive in all three replicates, except for one influenza A H1N1 strain (A/New Jersey/8/76) which tested positive in 2 of 3 replicates at 0.1 TCID50/mL. Results from the study are shown in Table 12.

a Purified viral RNA in simulated matrix was used for avian influenza A viruses due to biosafety regulations. Inactivated avian influenza A (H7N9) viruses without viral titer was diluted 100,000 fold in simulated matrix and tested due to biosafety regulations. c Known Victoria lineage. d Known Yamagata lineage.

Further in silico analysis was conducted to determine the predicted cross reactivity of additional influenza A 2009 H1N1-like strains $\mathrm { n } { = } 4$ strains/target). The results showed $100 \%$ sequence homology for all primer target nucleotide sequences analyzed.

# g. Analytical Specificity

An analytical specificity study was carried out to determine the potential for crossreactivity of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay with common respiratory pathogens or those potentially encountered in the nasopharynx. The panel of microorganisms included 16 viral, 26 bacterial and 2 yeast strains. Three replicates of each viral strain were tested at concentrations $\mathrm { o f } \geq 1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { \Xi } \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ . Bacterial and yeast strains were also tested in triplicate at concentrations $\mathrm { o f } \geq 1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ CFU/mL with the exception of Chlamydia pneumoniae, which was tested at $1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ . Each microorganism was prepared in negative simulated matrix to the concentrations indicated in Table 13 below.

Based on the results of this study, as summarized in Table 13, the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay showed no cross-reactivity with any of the 44 common respiratory microorganisms tested.

\* FluMist vaccine samples were unavailable for testing at the time this study was conducted. Samples containing FluMist may cause false positive results.

Eight negative replicates were tested per potentially interfering substance to determine the effects on the performance of the SPC. In addition, eight positive replicates were tested per substance for each of six influenza and four RSV strains included in this study. The panel of positive samples included two 2009 H1N1-like strains (A/California/7/2009 and A/Florida/27/2011), two influenza A H3N2 strains (A/Perth/16/2009 and A/Victoria/361/2011), two influenza B strains (B/Wisconsin/01/2011 and B/Massachusetts/02/2012), and four RSV strains (A/Long/MD/56, A/2/Australia/61, B/Wash/18537/62, and B/9320/MA/77) spiked into negative simulated matrix to an analyte concentration 3X the LoD.

No assay interference was observed in the presence of the substances at the concentrations tested in this study. All positive and negative replicates tested with the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay were correctly identified as summarized in Table 15 below.

# Potentially Interfering Microorganisms

An analytical interference study was conducted to assess the inhibitory effects of a select panel of commensal microorganisms common to the nasopharynx, on the performance of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay. Seven viral strains (listed in Table 16) $\mathrm { { a t } } \geq 1 \mathrm { { x } } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ were tested in the presence of one strain each of influenza A (A/Perth/16/2009), influenza B (B/Massachusetts/2/2012), RSV A (A/Long/MD/56) and RSV B $\mathrm { ( B / 9 3 2 0 / M A / 7 7 ) }$ viruses spiked individually at 3X the LoD into negative simulated matrix. Competitive interference of three commensal bacterial strains at $\geq$ $1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ was also evaluated with each of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay analytes. Testing was performed with replicates of eight for each of the target strain and each potentially interfering strain combination, and a negative simulated matrix control.

Under the conditions of the study, no inhibitory effects were observed for each of the strains tested in the presence of another analyte.

# Potential Competitive Analyte Interference

Internal competitive interference caused by co-infections of the targets in the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay was evaluated by testing individual influenza and RSV strains near the LoD in the presence of different influenza or RSV strains at higher concentration. Analytical competitive interference was assessed using one seasonal influenza A H3N2 strain (A/Victoria/361/2011), one influenza B strain (B/Massachusetts/2/2012), one RSV A strain (A/2/Australia) and one RSV B strain (B/Wash/18537/62).

Replicates of 20 were tested for each target strain and each competitive strain combination. The normal binomial distribution with 20 replicate samples at the limit of detection is between 17 and 20 positive results based on the binomial distribution with $\Nu { = } 2 0$ , $\mathrm { p } { = } 0 . 9 5$ $( \mathrm { X } { \sim } \mathrm { B i n } ( 2 0 , 0 . 9 5 )$ . Therefore sets of 20 with 16 or less positives would be rare and an indication of a competitive inhibitory effect due to high levels of a competing analyte.

The results for each analyte at the LoD in combination with another competitive anlayte are shown in Tables 17 to 20. The average Ct values for each strain tested at the LoD without a competitive analyte were taken directly from the Limit of Detection study.

The results from the study show potential for competitive inhibition in specimens with two different viruses in which one virus is present at the LoD and the other virus is present at $> 2$ logs higher $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ . The observed inhibitory effects are listed below and addressed in the limitations section of the package insert.

With influenza B/Massachusetts/2/2012 at a concentration near the LoD,   
competitive inhibitory effects were observed in the presence of $\mathrm { 1 x 1 0 ^ { 3 } \ T C I D _ { 5 0 } / m L }$ of influenza A/Victoria/361/2011.   
With RSV A/2/Australia/6 at a concentration near the LoD, competitive inhibitory effects were observed in the presence of $\mathrm { 1 x 1 0 ^ { 3 } T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ of influenza   
A/Victoria/361/2011.   
With RSV B/Wash/18537/62 at a concentration near the LoD, competitive inhibitory effects were observed in the presence of $\mathrm { 1 x 1 0 ^ { 2 } T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { \dot { m L } }$ of influenza A/Victoria/361/2011 and $\mathrm { 1 x 1 0 ^ { 3 } \ T C I D _ { 5 0 } \mathrm { \dot { / } m L } }$ of influenza B/Mass/2/2012.

i. Carry-Over/Cross-Contamination

Single-use, self-contained Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay cartridges were tested for their susceptibility to carry-over contamination when alternating high positive and negative samples are tested in the same GeneXpert module. In this study, negative simulated matrix samples were processed in the same module of a GeneXpert Dx System immediately following a high positive sample comprised of either an influenza A strain (A/Victoria/361/2011) at $2 \mathrm { { x } 1 0 ^ { 7 } \mathrm { { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / m L } }$ or an RSV A strain (A/Long/MD/26) at $\mathrm { i x 1 0 ^ { 4 } T C I D _ { 5 0 } / m L }$ spiked into negative simulated matrix. This process was repeated 20 times for a total of 41 runs resulting in 20 positive and 21 negatives for each virus type. A different GeneXpert module was used for each virus type.

All of the 42 negative replicates were correctly reported as “Flu A NEGATIVE; Flu B NEGATIVE; RSV NEGATIVE,” with Ct values of zero.

The 20 high influenza A positive replicates were correctly reported as “Flu A POSITIVE; Flu B NEGATIVE; RSV NEGATIVE,” and the 20 high RSV positive replicates were correctly reported as “Flu A NEGATIVE; Flu B NEGATIVE; RSV POSITIVE.” No evidence of specimen or amplicon carry-over contamination was observed.

# 2. Comparison Studies

# a. Method Comparison with Predicate Device

Performance of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay was evaluated against an FDA-cleared nucleic acid comparator method in a prospective clinical study (see below).

# b. Matrix Comparison

A matrix comparison study was conducted to determine whether the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay performs equivalently with NP swab clinical matrix and simulated nasal matrix. Leftover NP swab clinical matrix samples were supplied from commercial sources and pooled to create an NP swab clinical background matrix. The simulated nasal matrix was formulated with $2 . 5 \%$ (w/v) porcine mucin, $1 \%$ (v/v) human whole blood in $0 . 8 5 \%$ sodium chloride (NaCl) in 1X PBS solution with $1 5 \%$ glycerol, which was then diluted in Copan UTM to a final concentration of $1 6 . 7 \%$ . Both matrices were confirmed to be negative with the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay before being used to prepare positive samples. Positive samples included two influenza A strains, one influenza B strain, and two RSV strains prepared in both NP clinical swab matrix and simulated matrix at the four anlayte concentrations listed in Table 21.

The percent agreement between samples prepared in NP clinical matrix and simulated matrix was $100 \%$ (Lower $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I } = 9 4 . 4 2 )$ using the Wilson-Score method. All 65 samples per strain and per matrix were correctly reported as positive.

# c. Fresh versus Frozen Sample Comparison

The performance of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV assay with fresh and frozen specimens was evaluated for equivalency by testing individual influenza and RSV strains at three different concentrations representing low positives (2X LoD), moderate positives (5X LoD), and high positives (10X LoD) in pooled negative NP clinical swab matrix. The NP swab samples used in this study were prescreened with the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay. All the samples that resulted in a negative result (“Flu A NEGATIVE; Flu B NEGATIVE; and RSV NEGATIVE”) were pooled for this study. Negative samples consisted of NP swab matrix only.

The influenza and RSV viruses selected for this study were one seasonal influenza A H3N2 strain (A/Victoria/361/2011), one influenza B strain (B/Massachusetts/2/2012), one RSV A strain (RSVA/2/Australia/61), and one RSV B strain (RSV B/Wash/18537/62). Replicates of at least 20 were tested for each specimen condition and virus concentration. All positive and negative samples were tested under three conditions: fresh, after one freeze-thaw cycle, and after two freeze-thaw cycles. For each freeze-thaw cycle, the samples were placed at ${ } _ { - 8 0 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 24 hours after which they were thawed on ice for one hour prior to analysis with the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay. There was no statistically significant effect in the performance of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay between fresh virus dilution and two sequential freeze thaw cycles for positive and negative samples. All positive and negative replicates were correctly identified using the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay with the exception of one of 20 influenza A replicate tests at 2X the LoD which was reported as “Flu A POSITIVE; Flu B NEGATIVE; RSV POSITIVE” after two freeze thaw cycles by the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay.

# 3. Clinical studies

# a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity

Clinical performance characteristics of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay were evaluated at 11 investigational sites in the U.S. during the 2015-2016 influenza season. To be enrolled in the prospective study, patients had to be exhibiting signs and symptoms of respiratory infection at the participating sites, and had to provide informed consent for the collection of an NP swab specimen.

Site personnel collected one NP swab from each patient with the Cepheid Xpert

Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit. Prospectively collected NP swab specimens were tested with the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay according to the product insert instructions. Remaining sample specimen was stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for no more than 24 hours and shipped to the reference laboratory for comparator testing with an FDA-cleared molecular assay.

Due to a low prevalence of influenza viruses and the difficulty in obtaining fresh influenza and RSV-positive specimens, the specimen population for this study was supplemented with consecutively collected, frozen specimens. To be eligible for the clinical study, specimens had to be collected from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection whose routine care called for collection of NP swab specimens for influenza and/or RSV testing. Additionally, the leftover frozen sample volume had to have a minimum volume of $1 . 4 \mathrm { m L }$ Copan UTM.

A total of $2 5 8 0 \mathrm { N P }$ swab specimens were enrolled in the clinical study, of which 2503 were eligible for inclusion. From the 2503 eligible specimens, 2065 (1142 prospective fresh and 923 consecutive frozen specimens) swabs were tested by both the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay and comparator assay and were included in the final dataset used for the performance analysis. Patient age and gender distribution for each of the 2065 specimens are presented in Tables 23 and 24, respectively.

Of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay runs performed with eligible specimens, $9 8 . 4 \%$ (2038/2071) of these specimens were successful on the first attempt. The remaining 33 gave indeterminate results on the first attempt (20 ERROR, 10 INVALID, and $3 \mathrm { N O }$ RESULT). The initial indeterminate rate was $1 . 5 9 \%$ (33/2071) with the $9 5 \%$ CI 1.14- $2 . 2 3 \%$ . Thirty of the 33 indeterminate cases were retested, of which 27 yielded valid results upon repeat testing; three specimens were not retested. The overall rate of assay success was $9 9 . 7 \%$ (2065/2071). The overall indeterminate rate after retesting was $0 . 3 \%$ (6/2071) with $9 5 \%$ CI $0 . 1 3 \substack { - 0 . 6 3 \% }$ .

For the fresh, prospectively collected NP swab specimens, the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay demonstrated a PPA and NPA of $9 4 . 6 \%$ and $9 9 . 3 \%$ for influenza A; $100 \%$ and

$9 9 . 1 \%$ for influenza B; and $100 \%$ and $9 9 . 6 \%$ for RSV, respectively.

For the consecutively collected, frozen NP swab specimens, the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay demonstrated a PPA and NPA of $100 \%$ and $9 7 . 2 \%$ for influenza A; $100 \%$ and $9 8 . 2 \%$ for influenza B; and $9 7 . 9 \%$ and $9 7 . 7 \%$ for RSV, respectively.

For the combined dataset, the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay demonstrated a PPA and NPA of $9 8 . 1 \%$ and $9 8 . 4 \%$ for influenza A; $100 \%$ and $9 8 . 7 \%$ for influenza B; and $9 8 . 5 \%$ and $9 8 . 8 \%$ for RSV, respectively.

The performance results of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay relative to the comparative assay are summarized in Table 25. Data are stratified by analyte (influenza A, influenza B and RSV) and by sample type (prospective, fresh and consecutive, frozen). Data were shown to be poolable across specimen types, assay lots, study sites, gender, and patient age group.

Each instrument (Dx and Infinity) contains random access, closed-system, computer-based software and embedded firmware which run dedicated microprocessor-controlled modules to integrate sample preparation, amplification and real-time detection in a single system.

The GeneXpert Infinity modules contain extra robotic features for cartridge handling. The Xpertise software utilized by the Infinity Systems is the user interface and provides the ordering of tests as well as automates loading and unloading of cartridges into GeneXpert modules within the system. The Xpertise user interface builds upon the existing core software functionality for handling GeneXpert modules for cartridge fluidics control, temperature control, optics control, and data analysis by the addition of automation handling for the robotic arm.

# 6. Specimen Identification

Specimens are manually loaded into the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay cartridge by the user. The user can then either scan or type the sample and patient ID into the system. Prior to placing the cartridge into the GeneXpert Instrument System, the barcode on the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay cartridge is scanned. The information contained in the assay barcode is utilized by the software to run the appropriate assay definition file (ADF). If an assay is being run that does not already exist in the GeneXpert database, the user must import the ADF before starting the test.

Not required.

8. Quality Control

# Sample Processing Control

The sample processing control (SPC) is a non-infectious armored RNA pseudovirus that is included in each cartridge to verify that adequate processing of the sample has occurred. The SPC verifies that nucleic acids have been released from the target viruses if the organism is present and detects specimen-associated PCR and RT-PCR inhibitors. The SPC should be POSITIVE in a sample that is negative for all three influenza A, influenza B and RSV target analytes, and can be NEGATIVE or POSITIVE in a sample containing detectable levels of one or more of the target analytes.

# Probe Check Control

Before the start of the amplification process, the GeneXpert Instrument Systems measures the fluorescence signal from the probes to monitor bead rehydration, reaction tube filling, probe integrity, and dye stability. All assay reagents must be present and intact for the PCC to pass the validated acceptance criteria. If any of the PCC conditions fail, the result is reported as an ERROR and the test must be repeated using a new assay cartridge.
