510(k) Summary:

# Intended use:

RAPIDEC® CARBA NP is a phenotypic (colorimetric) in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of carbapenemase enzymes in Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonies that have elevated MIC values to any carbapenem. RAPIDEC® CARBA NP is performed on pure colonies grown on non-selective sheep blood agar culture media.

RAPIDEC® CARBA NP is intended as an aid in the prevention and control of infection caused by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

RAPIDEC® CARBA NP

Traditional 510(k) Submission RAPIDEC® CARBA NP is not intended to guide or monitor the treatment for these bacterial infections. A negative result does not preclude the presence of carbapenemase enzymes. The ability of RAPIDEC® CARBA NP to detect carbapenemase enzymes encoded by genetic markers other than KPC, NDM, OXA-48, VIM and IMP has not been established. RAPIDEC® CARBA NP testing should be used in conjunction with other laboratory tests including antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

# Device Description:

The RAPIDEC® CARBA NP strip is composed of 5 wells prepared with premeasured portions of the necessary substrates for the reactions. In addition, the kit contains the necessary accessories for performing the test.

In order to rehydrate the dry reagents and initiate the reactions, wells a, b and c are filled with $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of API Suspension Medium (purified water). The strip is left at room temperature for 4-10 minutes to allow the dry reagents to reconstitute in the wells. The bacterial inoculum suspension is prepared in well c until the turbidity equals well b. Well c contains the lysis buffer. In order to achieve lysis of the inoculum suspension, which enables the extraction of the enzyme, the strip is left at room temperature for additionally 30 minutes.

As the next step, $2 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the lysed inoculum suspension is transferred to wells d and e and $2 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ from well a (phenol red solution) is also transferred to wells d and e. The strip is incubated for 30 minutes at $3 3 { - } 3 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to allow for the hydrolysis to occur and change in color of the phenol red solution in case of presence of a carbapenemase enzyme. The initial reading is performed after 30 minutes of incubation. In case of a negative or doubtful reaction, the strip is re-incubated for an additional 1 hour and 30 minutes before performing the final reading.

The hydrolysis acidifies the medium which results in the change in color of the $\mathsf { p H }$ indicator. Reading is performed by comparing the colors in wells d and e. The test is positive when a significant variation in color is observed between the two wells. For example, the control well is red and the test well has changed to yellow.

RAPIDEC® CARBA NP demonstrated substantially equivalence when compared to the predicate device, Clearview $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Exact PBP2a Test (K091766) and substantially equivalent performance when compared to the composite reference method (CLSI Carba NP test, PCR characterization and carbapenemase MIC determinations). The performance was evaluated following information in the FDA Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA, issued August 28, 2009.

The Premarket Notification 510(k) presents data in support of RAPIDEC® CARBA NP.

# Performance Characteristics:

Non-clinical (analytical) and clinical studies were performed for RAPIDEC® CARBA NP.

# Analytical Performance

# Quality Control

Two quality control organisms were tested at each study site by RAPIDEC® CARBA NP on each day of testing. The organisms tested were:

Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ BAA- $1 7 0 5 ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ (positive reaction) Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ BAA- $1 7 0 6 ^ { \mathrm { { T M } } }$ (negative reaction)

The results of QC testing with RAPIDEC® CARBA NP met the pre-defined acceptance criteria $( { \ge } 9 5 \%$ agreement) when compared to the expected results as determined for the recommended QC strains.

# Analytical Reactivity (Challenge testing)

A total of 43 carbapenemase producers as determined by the reference composite method were tested by the RAPIDEC® CARBA NP. There were (2) VIM producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 41 carbapenemase producing Enterobactericeae consisting of (16) KPC, (10) NDM, (7) OXA-48, (5) VIM and (3) IMP.

An initial reading was performed at 30 minutes and when the result was negative, the final reading was performed at a total of 2 hours of $3 3 – 3 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ incubation.

All 43 strains were detected positive by RAPIDEC® CARBA NP following the reading protocol, with an analytical sensitivity of $1 0 0 \% ( 4 3 / 4 3 ) ^ { * }$ .

\* There were four negative results at the initial 30-minute read but became positive at the final 2–hour read; there were eight initial positive results that changed back to negatives when read again at 2 hours incubation.

# Cross-reactivity

A total of 93 non-carbapenemase producing strains with elevated carbapenem MICs were tested on the RAPIDEC® CARBA NP test. The strains tested include 67 strains (i.e., 59 Enterobacteriaceae, 8 Pseudomonas aeruginosa) related to the intended use, 26 other organisms including non-fermenting gram negative rods, gram positive organisms and yeast. All strains were well-characterized. The resistance mechanisms were AmpC, high level AmpC, porin loss, ESBL, porin loss/ESBL, porin loss/AmpC, MRSA, and VRE. An initial reading was performed at 30 minutes and if the result was negative a final reading was performed at a total of 2 hours of $3 3 – 3 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ incubation.

The analytical specificity was $9 7 . 9 \%$ (91/93) at 30 minutes of incubation due to the two intrinsic resistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The analytical specificity was $9 3 . 6 \%$ (87/93) at 2 hours of incubation. The results demonstrated one Enterobacteriaceae (Morganella morganii) with an AmpC resistance and 5 non-fermenting gram negative rods (three intrinsic resistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, one each for Burkholderia cepaciae and Sphingomonas paucimobilis) have given a positive reaction with the RAPIDEC® CARBA NP.

For intended Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, the analytical specificity was $100 \%$ (67/67) at 30 minutes of incubation and $9 8 . 5 \%$ (66/67) at 2 hours of incubation because of the AmpC producing Morganella morganii.

# Agar Culture Media Compatibility Studies

RAPIDEC® CARBA NP results with strains isolated on Columbia agar $+ 5 \%$ sheep blood (COS) were compared with those strains isolated on Trypticase Soy agar $+ 5 \%$ sheep blood (TSS). A total of 106 strains (92 carbapenemase producers and 14 noncarbapenemase producers) were tested. The carbapenemase producers included $1 9 \ \mathrm { I M P }$ , 20 KPC, 20 VIM, 17 NDM, and 16 OXA-48. The positive rate for the carbapenemase producers was $9 4 . 6 \%$ (87/92) and $9 2 . 4 \%$ (85/92) for TSS and COS

Traditional 510(k) Submission respectively at the initial 30-minute read. There were five (4 OXA-48 producing $K .$ . pneumoniae and one KPC producing K. pneumoniae) that were negative for both media and two NDM producing Providencia spp. for COS at the 30-minute read. The positive rate was $9 8 . 9 \%$ (91/92) for both media due to one negative KPC producing $K .$ . pneumoniae at the final 2-hour read. The negative rate for non-carbapenemase producers was $100 \%$ for both media at 30-minute and 2-hour reads. The results indicates no significant differences between TSS and COS.

# Clinical Studies

In the RAPIDEC® CARBA NP clinical study, a total of 457 strains consisting of 394 Enterobacteriaceae and $6 3 ~ P _ { \it \cdot }$ . aeruginosa were evaluated across 5 sites using both the routine and the short subculture procedures.

Carbapenemase determination was determined by a composite reference method composed of three tests: carbapenem MIC (Imipenem, Meropenem, Ertapenem and/or Doripenem), $\mathrm { C L S I } ^ { \mathbb { \mathrm {  } } }$ Carba NP and carbapenemase genetic markers by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).

Results from the three different tests were used to determine the carbapenemase positive/negative status of an isolate, with the final composite reference result based on agreement of at least two of the three tests. Agreement between RAPIDEC® CARBA NP and composite reference method was assessed. When a RAPIDEC® CARBA NP result was not in agreement with the composite reference result, it was further evaluated. A negative RAPIDEC® CARBA NP result was considered as a false negative when the composite reference result was determined to be positive, indicating a false noncarbapenemase producer. A positive RAPIDEC® CARBA NP result was considered as a false positive when the composite reference result was determined to be negative, indicating a false carbapenemase producer. The comparative performance is shown in Table 1. The performance of RAPIDEC® CARBA NP with Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa expressing the indicated carbapenemase genetic markers is shown in Table 2.

\* Insufficient growth/biomass for six $P$ . aeruginosa and two $K .$ . pneumoniae in the short subculture procedure. They were three VIM producing $P$ . aeruginosa, and one KPC producing $K .$ . pneumoniae; four negative samples including three $P .$ . aeruginosa and one $K .$ pneumoniae.

a Routine subculture false negative (false non-carbapenemase producer) rate was $0 . 4 \%$ (1/265) for claimed carbapenemases; the false negative was KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae

b Routine subculture false positive (false carbapenemase producer) rate was $2 . 6 \%$ (5/192) for $P$ . aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae; the five false positives were from Enterobactericeae

c Short subculture false negative (false non-carbapenemase producer) rate was $1 . 5 \%$ (4/257) for claimed carbapenemases; one false negative each for KPC, NDM, VIM, and OXA-48 from Enterobacteriaceae d Short subculture false positive (false carbapenemase producer) rate was $2 . 7 \%$ (5/188); the five false positives were from Enterobacteriaceae

# Reproducibility

A panel of 9 Enterobacteriaceae and $1 P .$ . aeruginosa including 4 negative and 6 positive carbapenemases was tested. Each organism was subcultured onto sheep blood agar and incubated for 18-24 hours for the routine subculture procedure and at least 4 hours for the

RAPIDEC® CARBA NP Traditional 510(k) Submission

short subculture procedure. RAPIDEC $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CARBA NP was performed on each organism in triplicates for 5 days at 3 sites and interpreted by 2 operators with the RAPIDEC $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CARBA NP results blinded to each other.

The reproducibility was $9 8 . 2 \%$ (884/900) with the routine subculture procedure and $9 9 . 1 \%$ (892/900) with the short subculture procedure.

# Conclusion

The results of the non-clinical and clinical performance studies support that RAPIDEC® CARBA NP is substantially equivalent to the composite reference method composed of three tests: carbapenem MIC (Imipenem, Meropenem, Ertapenem and/or Doripenem), CLSI $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Carba NP and carbapenemase genetic markers by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).
