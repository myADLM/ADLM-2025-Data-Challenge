C. Measurand: Influenza A and B nucleoprotein antigens

# D. Type of Test:

# E. Applicant:

F. Proprietary and Established Names: Sofia® Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ FIA on Sofia 2

# G. Regulatory Information:

1. Regulation Section: 21 CFR 866.3328, Influenza virus antigen detection test system

2. Classification: Class II

3. Product Code(s): PSZ- Devices detecting influenza A, B, and C virus antigens

4. Panel: Microbiology (83)

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended Use(s):

The Sofia Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ FIA employs immunofluorescence to detect influenza A and influenza B viral nucleoprotein antigens in direct nasal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, and nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash specimens and nasopharyngeal swab and nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash specimens in transport media from symptomatic patients. This qualitative test is intended for use as an aid in the rapid differential diagnosis of acute influenza A and influenza B viral infections. The test is not intended to detect influenza C antigens. A negative test is presumptive and it is recommended these results be confirmed by viral culture or an FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay. Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infections and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. This test is intended for professional and laboratory use.

The Sofia Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ FIA may be used with Sofia or Sofia 2.

Performance characteristics for influenza A and B were established during February through March 2011 when influenza viruses A/California/7/2009 (2009 H1N1), A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria-Like) were the predominant influenza viruses in circulation according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the CDC entitled “Update: Influenza Activity--United States, 2010-2011 Season, and Composition of the 2011-2012 Influenza Vaccine.” Performance characteristics may vary against other emerging influenza viruses.

If infection with a novel influenza virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, samples should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture samples.

2. Indication(s) for Use: Same as intended use

3. Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): For prescription use only

4. Special Instrument Requirements: To be used only with Sofia or Sofia 2 analyzers

# I. Device Description:

# 1. Overview

The Sofia Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ FIA is a rapid lateral flow immunoassay for the qualitative detection of influenza A and influenza B nucleoprotein in direct nasal swab (NS), nasopharyngeal swab (NP), and nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash (NA/W) specimens and NP and NA/W specimens in transport media collected from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The Sofia Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ FIA components have not been modified; detailed description of the lateral flow device is available in submissions K153012 and K112177, describing the Sofia Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ FIA use with the original Sofia analyzer.

The purpose of this submission is to obtain 510(k) clearance for the Sofia Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ FIA for use with the newly developed Sofia 2 analyzer. The Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers are similar in function and design. Both systems utilize the same fail-safes and failure alert mechanisms, the same calibration and assay-specific cartridges, and the same ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV LEDs) to excite the fluorophore. The primary difference between the original Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzer is the design of the optical detection system. Sofia uses a motorized optics unit to collect fluorescent signal data as it performs a series of scans across the longitudinal axis of the Sofia Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ FIA test strip, whereas Sofia 2 captures a still image of the entire test strip window using a complimentary color-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera. To emulate Sofia, the Sofia 2 analyzer converts pixels captured by the CMOS camera to fluorescent signal data, which is analyzed in an equivalent manner to Sofia to yield qualitative test results.

# 2. Quality Control

See decision summary for K112177.

# 3. Results Interpretation

There are five possible test results for the Sofia Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ FIA: influenza A and/or influenza B positive, influenza A and influenza B negative, or invalid. Influenza A and B dual positive result should be re-tested and repeated; dual positive result should be confirmed by virus culture or an FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay. If an invalid test result is reported, the Sofia Influenza FIA should be repeated with a new patient sample and a new test cassette.

Note: The Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers may be set to one of two operating modes: Walk Away or Read Now. Time to results for the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzer are described below.

· In Walk Away Mode, the user inserts the test cassette into the analyzer immediately following addition of the specimen to the Sofia Influenza $\mathrm { A + B }$ FIA sample port. The Sofia analyzer automatically times the test development and provides positive or negative test results after 15 minutes. The Sofia 2 analyzer scans the test cassette periodically during the test development time and displays a positive test result

between 3 and 15 minutes. If the test is negative, the result will be displayed after 15 minutes.

In the Read Now Mode, the user incubates the test cassette on the benchtop for 15 minutes before inserting the cassette into the Sofia or Sofia 2 analyzer. Positive and negative test results are displayed within 1 minute.

1. Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures. EP17-A2: Approved Guideline-Second Edition 2012.

# L. Test Principle:

See decision summary for K153012; the FDA-cleared Sofia Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ FIA has not been modified and it is compatible with the newly developed Sofia 2 analyzer.

# M. Performance Characteristics

Limit of detection, reproducibility, assay precision, early read, and method comparison studies were conducted to demonstrate equivalent performance of the Sofia Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ FIA on the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers. Results from each of these studies are described below. Additional analytical and clinical performance data for the Sofia Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ FIA is available under K153012.

# 1. Analytical Performance

# a. Limit of Detection

The limit of detection (LoD) of the Sofia Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ FIA was established on both the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers. The study included two influenza A and two influenza B virus strains spiked into negative clinical nasal swab matrix, and was designed to follow the approach outlined in CLSI document EP17-A2, entitled “Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures.”

Briefly, an initial range finding study was conducted in which each of the four influenza virus strains was prepared at two different concentrations using the negative clinical matrix pool and tested in replicates of five with two lots of devices on each of the two instrument platforms (Sofia and Sofia 2). For each strain, the lowest dilution yielding all five positive results was then used as the starting concentration for two-fold serial dilutions. The lowest dilution yielding all 10 positive results was defined as the preliminary LoD.

Additional 60 replicates of each virus strain at the preliminary LoD were tested on each of the two lots on each instrument platform. Testing spanned three days with at least 20 replicates run per day for each strain, lot and instrument combination.

The results of the LoD study are shown in Table 1 below.

The newly established LoDs (using a new preparation of the viral strains) for the Sofia Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ FIA on the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers differ by less than two-fold, indicating that the LoD generated on each of the two instruments is similar.

# $b$ . Reproducibility

The reproducibility of the Sofia Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ FIA on Sofia 2 analyzer was evaluated at three different laboratories. Two to three different operators at each site blindly tested a series of coded, contrived samples, prepared in negative nasal swab matrix, ranging from negative to moderate positive influenza A and influenza B. The influenza strains used were inactivated Influenza A/Hong Kong/8/68 and Influenza B/Allen/45. Testing of the same panel was also performed in parallel with Sofia in order to collect comparison data. Each operator at three study sites tested a 15-member reproducibility panel on both the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers once per day on 5 different days totaling 150 tests per each of the three testing sites for a total of 450 samples. The study was conducted in the Read Now mode.

The percent agreement between the expected results and the reproducibility study results for the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers for each analyte concentration tested is shown in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.

Although minor differences in the measured fluorescence were observed between the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers, no clinically significant difference was observed in the qualitative results; all clinical samples produced equivalent qualitative results. The interlaboratory qualitative agreement for Sofia Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ FIA with Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers was equivalent and ranged from $9 8 . 9 \%$ to $100 \%$ . Similarly, the intra-laboratory qualitative agreement for Sofia Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ FIA with Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers was found comparable and ranged from $9 8 . 7 \%$ to $100 \%$ .

# c. Assay Precision

To supplement the reproducibility study, within-laboratory precision of the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers was evaluated. Influenza A/California/07/09 and influenza B/Malaysian/2506/04 strains were tested at two different analyte concentrations: a “low positive” sample with an analyte concentration approximately 1X LoD and a “moderate positive” sample with an analyte concentration 2- 3X LoD. One negative matrix sample was also included in the testing.

Five samples (negative, low positive (influenza A and B) and moderate positive (influenza A and B)) were tested on three lots of Sofia influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ FIA cassettes, by two operators on 12 different days (1 sample x 3 reagent lots $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ operators $\textbf { x } 1 2$ days) totaling 72 replicates per sample per instrument. The assay was run in Read Now mode on one Sofia analyzer and one Sofia 2 analyzer.

Overall percent agreement between the expected results and the precision study results for the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzer is shown in Table 6 below.

Though a difference was observed between Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers for negative influenza B samples, the qualitative result of the analyzers did not change and all negative samples were $100 \%$ negative by both Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers. Overall, the study results showed that Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers generated clinically equivalent qualitative results when used by multiple operators, on multiple device lots, and operated over multiple days.

# d. Early Read

Additional study was performed to support the multi-read feature of the Sofia 2 analyzer in Walk Away mode i.e., the test cassettes were scanned and interpreted by the Sofia 2 analyzer at 3, 5, 8, 10, and 15 minutes. Positive samples were prepared using one strain each of influenza A (A/California/07/09) and influenza B (B/Malaysian/2506/04) spiked in M4-RT transport media. Negative samples were contrived with extraction reagent reconstituted with solutions of $0 . 2 \%$ to $0 . 8 \%$ mucin in $50 \%$ M4-RT and M6 viral transport media in saline. The study results demonstrated that positive samples (depending on the viral load) can be interpreted as positive as early as 3 minutes with Sofia 2 in Walk Away mode.

# 2. Comparison Studies

a. Method Comparison

A method comparison study using clinical samples was conducted to demonstrate comparable performance of the Sofia Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ FIA using the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers. The study was conducted at three sites testing identical specimen panels that consisted of 100 influenza A positive, 50 influenza B positive, and 100 influenza negative clinical samples. Each panel member was assigned to one of the analyte concentration levels based on the signal-to-cutoff ratio (S/CO) that was obtained from a single replicate on the Sofia analyzer. The Table 8 below shows the S/CO for each level.

A total of 250 tests were performed at each of the three testing sites resulting in a total of 749 results (one specimen test result was not recoverable) across the three testing sites utilizing 15 Sofia and 14 Sofia 2 analyzers. To assess the potential for early read with Sofia 2, the testing for all specimens was conducted in Walk Away Mode. In this mode,

Sofia 2 captured the images of each test cassette at 5, 8, and 15 minutes. The overall study results obtained after the full 15 minutes are shown in Tables 10 and 11 below. Agreement between the results obtained on the Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers for each of the individual analyte levels tested is shown in Tables 12 and 13.

The method comparison study results demonstrate that the performance of the Sofia Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ FIA on the Sofia 2 is comparable to the predicate device. There were 22 discordant results for influenza A and 8 discordant results for influenza B across all the three sites. Eighteen samples of the 22 discordant influenza A results were categorized as “high negative” and four samples were characterized as “Low positive $\mathrm { ( 1 X L o D ) ^ { \prime } }$ . All eight influenza B discordant results were characterized as “high negative”. These discordant results were observed across all three sites and were generated by multiple operators, no trend indicating any instrument bias was observed.

For influenza A specimens, $100 \%$ of the specimens yielded positive results by 8 minutes and at least $91 \%$ by 5 minutes at ${ \ge } 2 { - } 3 \mathrm { X }$ LoD; more than $80 \%$ were positive by 8 minutes at 1X LoD. For influenza B specimens, $100 \%$ of the specimens yielded positive results by 5 minutes at ${ \ge } 2 { - } 3 \mathrm { X }$ LoD; $89 \%$ were positive by 5 minutes and $100 \%$ were positives by 8 minutes at 1X LoD.

# N. Instrumentation/System Description

1. Instrument Name:

Sofia and Sofia 2

2. System Description:

The Sofia instruments are equipped with UV LED lighting and optical detection systems that are designed to collect and analyze fluorescent data emitted from the Sofia influenza

$\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ FIA test cassettes. The instrument software contains embedded assay-specific algorithms that are used to convert the fluorescent signal data into a qualitative test result.

# 3. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types.

Yes X or No

4. Level of Concern

Moderate

5. Software Description

The Sofia 2 Analyzer images the test strip and utilizes an embedded software algorithm to process the resulting data set into a qualitative test result. A positive test result for the analyte is determined by detection and analysis of the fluorescent signal at the test and reference lines, which are processed by the assay-specific algorithm. The algorithm employs a smoothing filter to the data and, identifies a peak maxima, minima and width, then calculates the RFU value based on peak height for the analyte test line. Results are presented on a screen and can be printed on an integrated printer.

# 6. Specimen Identification

Each cassette is labeled with a barcode that is detected by the Sofia 2 internal barcode reader. The 2-dimensinal barcode contains lot, expiration, and test method information. If the cassette is not in the correct orientation, the barcode cannot be read and the analyzer will display an error.

# 7. Calibration

To ensure that signal drift is controlled, the Sofia 2 analyzer has a calibration algorithm that reminds the operator to check the calibration status of the instrument every 30 days. The calibration cassette uses a highly stable fluorescent reagent along with a unique barcode. The insertion of this cassette triggers the Sofia 2 analyzer to self-check its calibration.
