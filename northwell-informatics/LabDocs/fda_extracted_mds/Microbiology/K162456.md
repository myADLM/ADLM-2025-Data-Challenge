Xpert Xpress Flu

Indications for Use (Describe) The Cepheid Xpert® Xpress Flu Assay, performed on the GeneXpert® Instrument Systems, is an automated, multiplex real-time, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay intended for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A and influenza B viral RNA. The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay uses nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens collected from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza infections in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or othe patient management decisions.

Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2015-2016 influenza season. When other novel influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

Ancillary Collection Kit Indications for Use:

The Xpert® Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit is designed to collect, preserve, and transport nasopharyngeal swab specimens and to preserve and transport nasal aspirate/wash specimens containing viruses from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection prior to analysis with the Xpert Flu Assay or the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay.

# Device Description:

The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay is a rapid, automated in vitro diagnostic test for qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A (Flu A) and influenza B (Flu B) viral RNA directly from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens. The assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert® Instrument Systems.

The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay includes reagents for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of the target viruses. The primers and probes in the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay detect the presence of nucleic acid sequences for Flu A and Flu B directly from NP swab specimens collected from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. A Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) are internal controls utilized by the GeneXpert Instrument System platform. The SPC is present in every assay to control for adequate processing of the target viruses and to monitor for the presence of inhibitor(s) in the PCR assay to avoid false-negative results. The PCC verifies reagent rehydration, real-time PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability.

The specimens are collected in viral transport medium and transported to the GeneXpert area. The specimen is prepared according to package insert instructions and transferred to the sample chamber (large opening) of the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay cartridge. The GeneXpert cartridge is loaded onto the GeneXpert Instrument System platform, which performs hands-off automated sample processing and real-time RT-PCR for detection of Flu viral RNA. Summary and detailed test results are obtained in approximately 30 minutes or less. The results are automatically generated at the end of the process in a report that can be viewed and printed.

respiratory infection prior to analysis with the Xpert Flu Assay or the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay.

The Xpert® Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit is designed to collect, preserve, and transport nasopharyngeal swab specimens containing viruses from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection prior to analysis with the Xpert Flu $^ +$ RSV Xpress Assay, Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay or the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay.

# Substantial Equivalence:

The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay is substantially equivalent to the current Xpert® Flu/RSV XC Assay [510(k) #K142045]. The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay detects influenza A and influenza B from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens and the Xpert® Flu/RSV XC Assay detects influenza A, influenza B, and RSV from both NP swab specimens and nasal aspirate/wash (NA/W) specimens. Both assays utilize the same technology by determining the presence of the target organisms through real-time RT-PCR amplification and fluorogenic target-specific hybridization detection. A multi-center clinical study was conducted and obtained data using the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay which was then reanalyzed with the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay Definition File (ADF). The reanalyzed data was used to determine the performance characteristics of the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay relative to the predicate device, which has been FDA cleared for NP swab and NA/W specimens. Discordant results between the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay and the reference method Prodesse ProFlu $^ +$ Assay [510(k) #K132129] were analyzed by bidirectional sequencing using primers different from those used in the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay. The study results showed that the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

Table 8-1 shows the similarities and differences between the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay and the predicate device.

Verification of the estimated LoD claim was performed on one reagent lot across a minimum of three testing days. LoD was established using two influenza A H3N2 strains, two influenza A 2009 H1N1 strains and two influenza B strains. Viruses were diluted into negative pooled NP swab clinical matrix for testing. The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration (tissue culture infective dose, $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ ) per sample that can be reproducibly distinguished from negative samples with $9 5 \%$ confidence or the lowest concentration at which 19 of 20 replicates were positive. Each strain was tested in replicates of 20 per concentration of virus. The LoD values for each strain tested are summarized in Tables 8-3 – 8-5.

# Analytical Specificity (Exclusivity)

The analytical specificity of the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay was evaluated by testing a panel of 44 cultures consisting of 16 viral, 26 bacterial, and two yeast strains representing common respiratory pathogens or those potentially encountered in the nasopharynx. Three replicates of each bacterial and yeast strain were tested at concentrations of $\geq 1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ CFU/mL with the exception of one strain that was tested at $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { \ C F U / m L }$ (Chlamydia pneumoniae). Three replicates of each virus were tested at concentrations of $\ge 1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { ~ T C I D } 5 0 / \mathrm { m L }$ . The analytical specificity was $100 \%$ .

# Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)

The analytical reactivity of the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay was evaluated against multiple strains of influenza A H1N1 (seasonal pre-2009), influenza A H1N1 (pandemic 2009), influenza A H3N2 (seasonal), avian influenza A (H5N1, H5N2, H6N2, H7N2, H7N3, H2N2, H7N9, and H9N2) and influenza B (representing strains from both Victoria and Yamagata lineages) at levels near the analytical LoD. A total of 48 strains comprised of 35 influenza A and 13 Influenza B strains were tested in this study with the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay. Three replicates were tested for each strain. All Flu strains tested positive in all three replicates, except for one Flu A H1N1 strain (A/New Jersey/8/76), which tested positive in 2 of 3 replicates at $0 . 1 \mathrm { T C I D } 5 0 / \mathrm { m L } .$ . Results are shown in Table 8-7.

Further in silico analysis was conducted to determine the predicted cross reactivity of additional influenza A 2009 H1N1-like strains. The results showed $100 \%$ sequence homology for all primer target nucleotide sequences analyzed.

# Potentially Interfering Substances

In a non-clinical study, potentially interfering substances that may be present in the nasopharynx were evaluated directly relative to the performance of the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay. Potentially interfering substances in the nasopharynx may include, but are not limited to: blood, nasal secretions or mucus, and nasal and throat medications used to relieve congestion, nasal dryness, irritation, or asthma and allergy symptoms, as well as antibiotics and antivirals. Negative samples $( \mathbf { n } = 8 )$ ) were tested per each substance to determine the effect on the performance of the sample processing control (SPC).

Positive samples $\mathrm { i } \hbar = 8$ ) were tested per substance with six influenza (four influenza A and two influenza B) strains spiked at 3X the analytical LoD determined for each strain. All results were compared to positive and negative simulated nasal matrix controls. The simulated nasal matrix consisted of $2 . 5 \%$ (w/v) porcine mucin, $1 \% ( \mathrm { v / v } )$ human whole blood in $0 . 8 5 \%$ sodium chloride (NaCl) formulated in $1 \mathbf { x }$ PBS solution with $1 5 \%$ glycerol, which was then diluted 1:5 in UTM.

The evaluated substances are listed in Table 8-8 with active ingredients and concentrations tested shown. None of the substances caused interference of the assay at the concentrations tested in this study. All positive and negative replicates were identified correctly using the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay.

The study consisted of a negative sample processed in the same GeneXpert module immediately followed by a very high influenza A sample (A/Victoria/361/2011, $2 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 7 } \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L } )$ ) spiked into a simulated nasal matrix. This testing scheme was repeated 20 times for a total of 41 runs resulting in 20 positive and 21 negative specimens for each virus type. All 20 positive samples were correctly reported as Flu A POSITIVE; Flu B NEGATIVE. All 21 negative samples were correctly reported as Flu A NEGATIVE; Flu B NEGATIVE.

# Fresh vs. Frozen Sample Equivalency Study

Fresh and frozen specimen equivalency in the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay was evaluated by testing individual influenza strains at three different concentrations representing low positives (2X LoD), moderate positives (5X LoD), and high positives (10X LoD) in pooled negative NP swab clinical matrix. Negative samples consisted of pooled negative NP swab clinical matrix only. Fresh and frozen specimen equivalency was determined using one seasonal Flu A H3N2 strain (A/Victoria/361/2011) and one Flu B strain (B/Mass/2/2012). Replicates of 20 were tested for each specimen type and concentration. All positive and negative specimens were tested fresh, after one freezethaw cycle, and after two freeze-thaw cycles. There was no difference in the performance of the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay between fresh virus dilutions and two sequential freeze thaw cycles for positive and negative samples. All positive and negative replicates were correctly identified using the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay.

# Competitive Interference Study

Competitive interference of the assay caused by the presence of two targets in the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay was evaluated by testing individual influenza strains near the LoD in the presence of different influenza strains at a higher concentration in a simulated nasal matrix. Analytical competitive interference was assessed using one (1) seasonal Flu A H3 strain (H3/Victoria/361/2011) at $0 . 8 \mathrm { \ T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ and one (1) Flu B strain (B/Mass/2/2012) at $0 . 4 5 \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ ; the strains were tested at in the presence of competing strains at either $1 \mathrm { \Delta x \ 1 0 ^ { 2 } \ T C I D _ { 5 0 } / m L }$ or $1 \mathrm { \Delta x \ 1 0 ^ { 3 } \ T C I D _ { 5 0 } / m L }$ . Replicates of 20 were tested for each target strain and each competitive strain combination. The normal binomial distribution with 20 replicate samples at LoD is between 17 and 20 positive results based on the binomial distribution with $\Nu { = } 2 0$ , $\mathrm { p } { = } 0 . 9 5$ (X\~Bin(20,0.95)). Therefore, sets of 20 with 16 or less positives would be rare and an indication of a competitive inhibitory effect due to high levels of a competing analyte.

With Flu A/Victoria/361/2011 at a concentration of $0 . 8 \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ no competitive inhibitory effects were observed in the presence of $1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 3 }$ $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ of Flu B/Mass/2/2012.

With Flu B/Mass/2/2012 at a concentration of 0.45 $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ competitive inhibitory effects were observed in the presence of $\mathrm { 1 x 1 0 ^ { 3 } ~ T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ of Flu A/Victoria/361/2011. No competitive inhibitory effects were observed in the presence of $\mathrm { 1 x 1 0 ^ { 2 } T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ of Flu A/Victoria/361/2011.

Under the conditions of this study, internal competitive inhibitory effects were observed on the targets (Flu A and Flu B) in the presence of two targets for the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay. The competitive inhibitory effect on the Xpert Xpress Flu targets is addressed in the Limitations section of the package insert.

# Clinical Studies

# Clinical Comparison Study

Performance characteristics of the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay were evaluated at eleven institutions in the U.S. during the 2015-2016 influenza season. Due to the low prevalence of influenza viruses and the difficulty in obtaining fresh influenza specimens, the specimen population for this study was supplemented with consecutively collected, frozen specimens.

Specimens were collected from the following:

Individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of respiratory infection who provided informed consent for the collection of a NP swab specimen.   
Individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and whose routine care called for collection of NP swab specimens for influenza testing. For eligible subjects, aliquots of leftover specimens were obtained for testing with the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay and reference testing, and patient management continued at the site per their standard practice.

The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay performance was compared to FDA-cleared molecular comparator assay. Bi- directional sequencing was performed on specimens where the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay and the comparator assay were discrepant, and is provided for informational purposes only.

# Overall Results – NP Swab Specimens

A total of 2065 NP swab specimens were tested for influenza A and influenza B by the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay and the comparator assay. Of the 2065 NP swab specimens, 1142 were fresh, prospectively collected and 923 were consecutively collected, frozen specimens.

For the fresh, prospectively collected NP swab specimens, the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay demonstrated a PPA and NPA of $9 4 . 6 \%$ and $9 9 . 3 \%$ for the detection of influenza A and $100 \%$ and $9 9 . 2 \%$ for influenza B, respectively (Table 8-9).

# CONFIDENTIAL

For the consecutively collected, frozen NP swab specimens, the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay demonstrated a PPA and NPA of $100 \%$ and $9 7 . 2 \%$ for the detection of influenza A, respectively; $100 \%$ and $9 8 . 2 \%$ for influenza B, respectively (Table 8-9).

For the combined dataset, the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay demonstrated a PPA and NPA of $9 8 . 1 \%$ and $9 8 . 4 \%$ for the detection of influenza A and $100 \%$ and $9 8 . 7 \%$ for influenza B, respectively (Table 8-9).

# Reproducibility Study

Reproducibility was established in a multi-center, blinded study using a 5-member specimen panel consisting of a negative control and two each of simulated nasal matrix spiked with influenza A, or influenza B at 1X (low pos) and 2-3X (mod pos) the respective LODs. Testing was performed at three sites (one internal, two external) using the GeneXpert Dx system, the Infinity-48 system, and the Infinity80 system. Two operators at each site tested one panel in duplicate two times per day (equivalent to four replicates per day) over six, not necessarily consecutive days. Three lots of Xpert Xpress Flu cartridges were used, with each lot representing approximately two days of testing. Results are summarized in Table 8-10.
