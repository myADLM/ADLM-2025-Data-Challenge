# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 is an in vitro immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative detection of influenza A and B nucleoprotein antigens in nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and nasal swab specimens. It is intended to aid in the rapid differential diagnosis of influenza A and B viral infections. Negative test results are presumptive and should be confirmed by cell culture or an FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay. Negative test results do not preclude influenza viral infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 must be read by the Alere™ Reader.

Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2015-2016 influenza season when influenza A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 pandemic were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

2. Indication(s) for use:

To aid in the differential diagnosis of influenza A and B viral infections in patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements: Alere™ Reader

# I. Device Description:

The Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 is an immunochromatographic membrane assay that detects influenza type A and B nucleoprotein antigens in respiratory specimens. Influenza specific antibodies and a control antibody are immobilized onto a membrane support as three distinct lines on the test strip. The test strip is mounted inside a cardboard, book-shaped hinged test card. Swab specimens require a sample preparation step, in which the sample is eluted off the swab into Elution Solution supplied with the kit in $0 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ vials $( 3 5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ per vial). The sample is then added to the top of the test strip with a fixed volume transfer pipette $( 1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L } )$ and the test card is closed. After 15 minutes, the card assay is inserted into the AlereTM Reader for the interpretation of results.

The AlereTM Reader is a small bench top camera-based instrument to be used in conjunction with the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 assay. The Reader analyzes the intensity of the test and control lines and displays the results (positive, negative or invalid) on a display screen. The screen is intended as a means of user interface informing the user how to operate the Reader and to display test results. The Reader is supplied with a Calibration Check Card. To ensure proper function, a calibration check is required to be performed at least every 30 days. The calibration check verifies that the Reader’s internal camera is functioning correctly and that the Reader is working to specification. Operator ID and subject ID can be entered manually, through the touchscreen or via the provided barcode scanner. Results are stored in memory, and can be printed, if desired, on an optional printer connected via USB. In addition, patient test results can be uploaded to a compatible data management system via Ethernet. If connected to a data management system, results are uploaded automatically and are no longer available in memory.

The assay kit consists of 22 Test Cards (a cardboard, book-shaped hinged test card containing the test strip), 25 fixed volume $( 1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { l } )$ transfer pipettes, 22 Elution Solution Vials, 22 nasal swabs, 1 Positive Control swab (inactivated influenza A and B viruses dried onto the swab), and 1 Negative Control swab (inactivated Streptococcus Group A dried onto the swab).

The kit may be stored at $2 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff: Establishing the Performance Characteristics of In Vitro Diagnostic Devices for the Detection or Detection and Differentiation of Influenza Viruses (issued on: July 15, 2011).

# L. Test Principle:

The test is based on the antigen-antibody binding properties characteristic of immunoassays. The Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 uses highly sensitive recombinant antibodies (rFabs) that specifically recognize influenza A and influenza B nucleoprotein antigens in respiratory specimens. A patient line (one for influenza A and one for influenza B) is formed by adsorbing purified viral antigen specific BSA-fab conjugate proteins on the test strip membrane. A control line is formed by adsorbing purified rabbit anti-mouse antibodies onto the test strip membrane. As the patient sample travels across the test strip, viral antigens, if present in the sample, react with the reagents on the membrane and are detected by the AlereTM Reader.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

# 1. Analytical performance:

Analytical studies were conducted using pooled pre-screened negative nasal swab matrix (unless stated otherwise). The sample diluent was tested in triplicate with the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 assay prior to use in preparing dilutions. The matrix was stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for no more than 5 days.

The influenza virus strains used in the studies were purchased, then re-grown and retitered to concentrations expressed in $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ . Each influenza virus strain was serially diluted in the nasal swab matrix pool to generate the desired virus concentrations for testing.

The limit of detection (LoD) of the assay was determined by evaluating different concentrations of five (5) strains of influenza A and three (3) strains of influenza B virus for swabs eluted in Elution Solution. The study was conducted using pooled, prescreened negative nasal swab matrix. Contrived nasal swab samples were prepared by coating $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of each virus dilution onto the swab. The contrived swab samples were tested by elution in the elution solution according to the test procedure. The LoD for each influenza strain tested was determined by testing 20 replicates of each dilution. The LoD was defined as the concentration where at least 19 of the 20 replicates were positive for the given virus. The confirmed LoDs in natural nasal swab matrix for swabs eluted in Elution Solution for each influenza strain tested are presented in the table below:

\*The LoD is reported as a dilution factor from the stock of inactivated virus. The concentration of the virus stock prior to inactivation was $1 0 ^ { 1 0 . 9 } \mathrm { E I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$

# b. Reproducibility

The reproducibility of the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 assay was evaluated at three testing sites, with 6 operators (2 at each site), over five testing days, using two lots of reagents and five Readers. One strain of influenza A (Influenza A/California/7/2009) and one strain of influenza B (Influenza B/Nevada/03/2011), were diluted in Viral Transport Media (VTM) to targeted concentrations: high negative (just below the LoD), low positive (at the limit of detection), and moderate positive (3x LoD), for a total of 7 test samples. Contrived nasal swab samples were prepared by coating $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of each virus dilution onto the swab. Dried swabs were packaged and assembled into blinded panels of 21 swabs. Each panel consisted of three swabs (individual replicates) for each of the test samples. Each test operator was provided with a panel of samples to be tested on each of the 5 days of testing. The swab samples were tested according to the product instructions with results read by the Alere™ Reader. There were six instances of invalid results, of which 5 were repeated and generated valid results. There was one sample that generated Flu A and B positive results, which was considered invalid and was not repeated.

One positive and one negative control swab was tested with the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 test on each day of testing prior to performing the study testing.

The site-to-site reproducibility of the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 assay is shown below.

Specimen stability was evaluated to support storage recommendations for swabs that are not tested immediately after collection. The study was conducted with weakly reactive samples for influenza A and influenza B, at concentrations approximately 2 times the

LoD. The influenza strains and the concentrations used in the sample stability study are shown below.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Strain</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Target Concentration(TCID50/mL)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>A/California/7/2009</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.19 x 104</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>B/Nevada/03/2011</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.94 x 104</td></tr></table>

Swab samples were prepared by inoculating the swab head with $1 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ of Flu A, Flu B or clinical matrix diluent sample (for negative samples).

The stability of the samples was evaluated both prior to and after processing with the Elution Solution.

# Dry Swab Stability

Flu A and Flu B positive and negative swab samples, not eluted before storage, were tested at time $\scriptstyle  = 0$ (soon after swab preparation) and at the following time points and temperatures of storage prior to testing:

Room Temperature $( 1 5 . 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ : 1 hr, 2 hrs, 5 hrs, 9 hrs Refrigerator $\left( 2 \mathrm { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \right)$ : 1 hr, 9 hrs, 17 hrs, 25 hrs, 37 hrs

Samples were tested with the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 in triplicate according to the product instructions.

All swabs generated expected results (i.e., influenza A swabs tested positive for Flu A, influenza B swabs tested positive for Flu B, and the negative swabs tested negative for Flu A and Flu B). The results support the sample stability of up to 4 hours after collection when stored at room temperature and up to 24 hours when stored in a refrigerator.

Swab Stability after Elution with the Elution Solution

Eluted samples were prepared by eluting swabs, prepared as above, in $3 5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of Elution Solution. Flu A and Flu B positive and negative swab samples eluted in the Elution Solution before storage were tested at time $\scriptstyle  = 0$ and at the following time points when stored in a refrigerator prior to testing:

Refrigerator $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ 1 hr, 17 hrs, 25 hrs, 37 hrs

Samples were tested with the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 in triplicate according to the product instructions.

All swabs generated expected results (i.e., influenza A swabs tested positive for Flu A, influenza B swabs tested positive for Flu B, and the negative swabs tested negative for

Flu A and Flu B). The results support the claim of stability up to 36 hours when samples eluted in the Elution Solution are stored in a refrigerator at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ before testing.

# e. Swab Type Validation

The sponsor evaluated the performance of the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 test when using various swab types for collection of nasal specimens. The study was conducted with swabs spiked with influenza A and influenza B viruses to approximately 2 times the established LoD. Clinical nasal matrix pool was used as a diluent. The following influenza strains and concentrations were used in this study.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>InfluenzaStrain</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Target ConcentrationTCID50/mL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>A/California/7/2009</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.54 x 104</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>B/Nevada/03/2011</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.9 x 104</td></tr></table>

For this study, $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the prepared virus dilution was spiked into $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the clinical matrix diluent. Positive swabs were prepared by dipping the swab into either the Flu A or Flu B spiked solution and twirling the swab three times to coat it. Negative swabs were prepared by dipping the swab into $1 1 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of clinical matrix diluent and twirling the swab three times to coat it. Samples were tested with the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 in 10 replicates according to the product instructions. The following swabs were evaluated:

• Puritan PurFlock® Ultra flocked swab – standard tip   
• Puritan PurFlock® Ultra flocked swab – mini tip   
• Puritan PurFlock® Ultra flocked swab - large tip   
• Puritan HydraFlock® flocked swab – standard tip   
• Puritan Nasopharyngeal foam tipped swab   
• Puritan Foam tipped swab, polystyrene handle   
• Puritan Polyester tipped applicator, plastic handle   
• Puritan Rayon tipped applicator, plastic handle   
• Puritan Calcium Alginate tipped applicator Copan Regular flocked swab, plastic applicator, sterile, individually wrapped $1 0 0 \mathrm { m m }$   
• Copan Polyester, regular tip, plastic handle Copan, Rayon, regular tip, plastic handle

The data showed that of the swabs tested, Puritan Calcium Alginate and PurFlock Ultra Flocked Swab - large tip swabs are not appropriate for use with the Alere BinaxNOW $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Influenza A & B Card 2 test. The following statement is included in the Sample Collection and Handling Section of the Product Insert: “Puritan PurFlock Ultra® Flocked swabs – large tip and Puritan Calcium Alginate swabs are not suitable for use in this assay.”

# f. Assay Cutoff

The assay cutoff (threshold of detection) was determined based on testing of positive and negative samples of varying concentrations using 858 test devices, for a total 1716 test results [638 negative results (319 for Flu A and 319 for Flu B) and 1078 positive results (598 positive for Flu A and 480 positive for Flu B)]. The Reader analyzes the pixel intensity, and compares the pixel intensity of a “band” (i.e. Target Line), to its surrounding areas. The optical reading is calculated as follows:

Optical Reading $=$ [(Background Intensity – Band Intensity)] / Background Intensity

The Optical Readings were analyzed to determine, statistically, what threshold represents a positive versus a negative result. The Mixed Effects Analysis of Variance method was employed to estimate and test for differences between diluents and lines (on the device) and also to estimate the standard deviation of the reading taking into account all known sources of variation. The statistical analysis was applied to all the negative results (lines with 0 signal) from:

a. 319 negative samples (2 lines with 0 signal per device, for a total of 638 results), and   
b. 539 positive samples (1 line with 0 signal per device, (240 negative results for Flu A and 299 negative results for Flu B), for a total of 539 results).

The different sources of random variation considered included:

• Lot to lot differences   
• Interaction between the Reader and diluent lots Differences between devices Differences with the devices (two lines on each device)

The cutoff was established based on the intensity of fluorescence of positive and negative results using the full set of data (1716 results).

# g. Analytical Reactivity (inclusivity)

An analytical reactivity (inclusivity) study was performed to determine whether the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 is able to detect a variety of influenza A and B strains that represent temporal and geographic diversity. Pre-screened negative natural nasal swab specimens were eluted in 1 X PBS. Swab elutes were combined and mixed thoroughly to create a clinical matrix pool to be used as the diluent. Each influenza virus strain was diluted in this natural nasal swab matrix pool to generate virus dilutions for testing. The vendor provided virus strains were re-titered and the concentrations (in

$\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ ) were determined by standard virology methods.

Contrived swab samples were prepared by coating $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of virus dilution onto each swab. The contrived swab samples were tested in triplicate in serial dilution series until the lowest concentration of each strain generated positive results in all three replicates. The Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 assay detected all strains tested (3/3) at the concentrations indicated in the table below.

h. Analytical Specificity

# Cross-Reactivity

To determine the analytical specificity of the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2, 58 commensal and pathogenic microorganisms (41 bacteria, 16 viruses and one yeast) that may be present in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx were tested. The bacteria and yeast were re-grown and re-titered by the sponsor; the commercially obtained viruses were tested based on the vendor reported concentrations. For each organism, $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the stock was added to a vial containing $3 5 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of Elution Solution and tested with the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 assay in three replicates according to the test procedure. For each organism, the highest concentration that yielded negative results in all three replicates when tested with the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2, is shown below.

# Interference

The effect of substances naturally present in respiratory specimens, or that may be artificially introduced into the nasal cavity or nasopharynx, were evaluated with the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 assay. One strain of influenza A and influenza B was diluted in pooled pre-screened negative nasal clinical matrix diluent. The targeted concentrations of the viruses used in the study were at approximately 2 times the predetermined LoD and are shown below.

<table><tr><td>Influenza Strain</td><td>TCID50/mL</td></tr><tr><td>A/California/7/2009</td><td>1.19 x 104</td></tr><tr><td>B/Nevada/03/2011</td><td>1.94 x 104</td></tr></table>

Swabs were prepared by coating $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of a virus dilution or clinical matrix diluent onto the swab. Each potential interfering substance was added to $3 1 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the Elution Solution at $3 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ volume. One of the Flu A or Flu B inoculated swabs from above (or a clinical matrix diluent representing a negative sample) was placed into each tube. Each substance was tested in triplicate.

# i. Inhibition by Other Common Respiratory Pathogens

A study was conducted to evaluate the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 test performance in the presence of non-influenza respiratory pathogens. Vendor provided stocks of one strain of influenza A and one strain of influenza B were diluted in clinical matrix to approximately 2 times the limit of detection. Contrived influenza A and B positive swab specimens were prepared by coating $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the virus dilutions onto each swab. The co-infection (non-influenza) viruses were added onto the same swabs in $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ volumes using the original stock concentrations obtained from a commercial vendor. The co-infection viruses were also applied onto clean (not coated with influenza viruses) swabs as controls. Each swab was tested in triplicate according to the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 test procedure.

The following panel of non-influenza viruses was tested at the concentrations provided in the table below.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Virus Panel</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentration (TCID50/ml)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Adenovirus Type 1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.58 x 107</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Rhinovirus Type 1A</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.58 x 108</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Type B, Strain 18537</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8.89 x 105</td></tr></table>

All tests gave expected results, i.e., all swabs coated with influenza A virus tested positive for Flu A, all swabs coated with influenza B tested positive for Flu B, and all swabs coated only with the co-infection pathogens tested negative for Flu A and for Flu B.

# j. Co-infection with Influenza Viruses

A study was conducted to determine if the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 test can detect weakly positive influenza A samples in the presence of concentrated influenza B virus and weakly positive influenza B samples in the presence of concentrated influenza A virus.

The weakly reactive (reference) swab samples were prepared using the influenza A and influenza B strains diluted to approximately 2 times the pre-determined LoD with pooled pre-screened clinical nasal matrix diluent. Swabs were prepared by coating $1 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the virus dilution onto the swab.

The same influenza A and influenza B strains were also diluted in clinical matrix diluent to 20 times (20X) the pre-determined LoD with pooled pre-screened clinical nasal matrix diluent. To prepare the co-infection swabs, $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the 20X diluted influenza A strain was added to the reference influenza B swabs prepared above. Similarly, $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the 20X diluted influenza B strain was added to the reference influenza A swabs prepared above using the same method. The concentration of each influenza strain tested is presented below.

The results of this study showed that the ability of the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A&B Card 2 test to detect influenza A in weakly positive samples in the presence of high titers of influenza B virus is not affected. Similarly, the ability of the device to detect influenza B in weakly positive samples in the presence of high titers of influenza A virus is not affected.

# k. Controls

# External Controls

One swab each, a low positive control for influenza $\mathrm { A } / \mathrm { B }$ and a negative control, are provided with each kit. The Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B External Controls are designed for use with Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2. The Positive Control swab is coated with inactivated Influenza A and B viruses dried onto a swab. The Negative Control swab is coated with inactivated Streptococcus Group A dried onto a swab. Additional controls (10 Positive and 10 Negative Control Swabs) are available as an accessory to the kit.

Process Control (internal, on every test strip)

A built in assay control is present on every test strip (visible as a blue line on each unused cartridge) and consists of purified rabbit anti-mouse antibodies. It serves to control for the proper flow of reagents across the test strip.

# 2. Clinical study:

Clinical performance characteristics of the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 were evaluated in a multi-site prospective study during the 2015-2016 flu season (December 2015 to April 2016) in the U.S. A total of 12 investigational sites throughout the U.S. participated in the study. To be enrolled in the study, patients had to be presenting at the participating study centers with flu-like symptoms. Either two nasopharyngeal swabs or two nasal swabs were collected from one nostril from each patient with flu-like symptoms using standard collection methods. In each case, one of the collected swabs was eluted in the Elution Solution and tested using the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 at the study sites according to product instructions.

The other swab was eluted in $1 \mathrm { m L }$ of Viral Transport Media (VTM) and shipped to a central laboratory for testing with a FDA cleared influenza real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay used as the comparator for this study.

A total of 645 Subjects were enrolled in the study. Of those, 60 swab samples did not meet eligibility criteria due to protocol deviations (sample handling or storage errors or subject withdrawal). A total of 585 nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens were considered evaluable. Patient age and gender distribution for all the evaluable specimens are shown below.

Among the 585 samples tested, 20 samples gave invalid results (these samples were not re-tested), leaving 565 samples to be included in the calculations of assay performance. The invalid rate observed was $3 . 4 \%$ (20/585) with the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval $2 . 2 \%$ - $5 . 2 \%$ (the invalid rate includes 19 results that were positive for both influenza A and B). The clinical performance of the Alere BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Card 2 assay, as compared to an FDA cleared molecular method for detection of influenza A and B, is shown below.

Yes X or No

3. Specimen Identification: Specimens are identified by scanning a barcode or by manual entry using touch screen.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The samples are collected and processed outside of the Reader. The instrument does not perform any sample handling and is used only to read the final signal generated on the test strip.

5. Calibration:

The Alere™ Reader is supplied with a Calibration Check Card to check the assay reading performance. A calibration check verifies that the internal digital camera is functioning correctly, the lens is free from debris, and the Alere™ Reader is working to specification. The calibration check is required to be performed at least every 30 days. If a calibration check has not been performed in the last 30 days, an error is registered and no tests are processed until the calibration check is performed.

The calibration check consists of performing a multi-point reading over the surface of the test strip. If the result of any read point is outside a specified range, an error is returned, and no further assay reading can be performed until a successful calibration check is run.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered in the “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

Not applicable.
