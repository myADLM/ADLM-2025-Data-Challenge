# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): Not Applicable

# L. Test Principle:

The Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay involves three main steps, which all take place in a single tube on the Panther system: target capture, target amplification by real time transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), and detection of the amplification products (amplicons) by the fluorescent labeled probes (torches). The assay incorporates an Internal Control (IC) in every test to monitor targeted nucleic acid capture, amplification and detection.

# Target capture:

When the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay is performed, the targeted viral mRNA and IC are isolated using magnetic microparticles and target-specific capture oligomers, in a process called target capture. The capture oligomers contain sequences complementary to specific regions of the targeted RNA (HSV mRNA or IC) as well as a string of deoxyadenosine residues. During the hybridization step, the sequence-specific regions of the capture oligomers bind to specific regions of the RNA target molecules. The microparticles, including the captured RNA target molecules bound to them, are pulled to the side of the reaction tube using magnets and the supernatant is aspirated. The particles are washed to remove residual specimen matrix that may contain amplification inhibitors. After target capture steps are completed, the specimens are ready for amplification.

# Target Amplification by TMA:

Target amplification occurs via TMA, which is a transcription-based nucleic acid amplification method that utilizes two enzymes, MMLV (Moloney murine leukemia virus) reverse transcriptase and T7 RNA polymerase. The reverse transcriptase is used to generate a DNA copy (containing a promoter sequence for T7 RNA polymerase) of the target sequence. T7 RNA polymerase produces multiple copies of RNA amplicon from the DNA copy template.

# Detection:

Detection is achieved using single-stranded nucleic acid torches that are present during the amplification of the target and hybridize specifically to the amplicon in real time. Each torch has a fluorophore and a quencher. The quencher suppresses the fluorescence of the fluorophore as it is designed to be in close proximity when not hybridized to the amplicon. When the torch binds to the amplicon, the quencher is moved farther away from the fluorophore and it will emit a signal at a specific wavelength when excited by a light source. More of the torches hybridize when more amplicon is present. The increase in fluorescent signal from progressive amplification is detected by fluorometers within the Panther system. The Panther system can detect and discriminate between the three fluorescent signals corresponding to HSV-1, HSV-2 and IC amplification products. The fluorescence (measured in relative fluorescence units [RFU]) is monitored over time to produce a real-time fluorescence emergence curve for each reporter dye. The Panther system software compares the fluorescence emergence curves to fixed cut off times to report results (TTime) for HSV-1, HSV-2 and IC.

# Test Interpretation:

Test results are automatically determined by the assay software. Results for HSV-1 and HSV-2 detection are reported separately. Table 1 shows the possible results reported in a valid run and result interpretations. Samples with invalid test results should be retested. The first valid result should be reported.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Reproducibility:

Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay reproducibility was evaluated at three external US sites. Testing was performed using three lots of assay reagents and six operators (two at each site). At each site, testing was performed for at least six days where two operators each performed two runs per day over at least three days with one operator performing testing each day. Panel members were created by spiking HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 viral particles into neat STM and three replicates of each panel member were tested in each run. Final HSV-1 concentrations ranged from $0 \mathrm { \ T C I D { 5 0 } / m L }$ to 86.96 $\mathrm { T C I D 5 0 / m L }$ and final HSV-2 concentrations ranged from $0 \mathrm { \ T C I D 5 0 / m L }$ to 1.63 $\mathrm { T C I D 5 0 / m L }$ ; agreement with expected results is presented in Table 2. Table 3 summarizes the TTime results for panel members containing low and moderate levels of HSV-1 and HSV-2 and Table 4 summarizes the TTime results for the Positive Control.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable.   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Internal Control

The IC consists of a random sequence of RNA unrelated to HSV 1 or HSV 2 . The IC is added to each specimen aliquot during sample preparation and is amplified in the same reaction as the HSV-1 and HSV-2 mRNA targets. It is used to determine the validity of each individual reaction and as an indicator of analyte capture, amplification and/or detection errors, as well as to control for operator and instrument errors.

# External Assay Controls

Two controls are provided separately by Hologic to the user in the Aptima HSV Controls Kit: one HSV1/HSV2 dual positive control and one negative control. The positive control is composed of known concentrations of in vitro transcripts (IVT) corresponding to HSV-1 and HSV-2 UL42 mRNAs. These controls must generate results within predefined specifications to be valid. The negative control must also provide a valid negative result for the run to be valid. Additionally, both controls must generate IC results within predefined specifications.

d. Detection limit:

(i) Analytical Sensitivity (Limit of Detection) in Clinical Specimen Matrix:

The Limit of Detection (LoD) of the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay was determined by testing a series of panels consisting of HSV-1 or HSV-2 diluted in pooled negative clinical specimens collected in one of two transport media: 1) STM and 2) VTM. For HSV-1, MacIntyre and HF viral strains were tested. For HSV-2, MS and G strains were tested. At least 60 replicates were tested at each concentration for each panel member for each matrix and virus strain across 3 reagents lots. The LoD for each strain and specimen type was calculated using Probit analysis and summarized in Table 5.

(ii) LoD Verification:

The LoD was verified using two clinical isolates of HSV-1 and two clinical isolates of HSV-2 in both VTM and STM. Each HSV clinical isolate was tested with the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay using 60 replicates each at 3 concentrations (1X LoD, 3X LoD, and 10X LoD, see Table 6 for LoD values). Testing was completed in both STM and VTM matrix for all four clinical isolates and was conducted using 3 lots of reagents. All replicates for all clinical isolates at all three concentrations tested were detected by the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay, demonstrating that the assay can detect a range of both HSV-1 and HSV-2 clinical isolates at the determined LoD.

e. Analytical specificity:

Potential cross-reactivity to the non-targeted micro-organisms listed in Table 7 was evaluated in the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assays. Panel members were prepared by spiking the potentially cross-reacting microorganisms into STM and then these panels were divided into 3 groups: 1) unspiked, 2) HSV-1 spiked to a concentration of 3X LoD, and 3) HSV-2 spiked to a concentration of 3X LoD. Group 1 was used to test for cross-reactivity while Groups 2 and 3 were used to test for microbial interference. No cross-reactivity or interference in the performance of the assay was observed in the presence of the microorganisms tested.

# f. Interfering Studies

The susceptibility of the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay to interference by elevated levels of potentially interfering substances that may be present in clinical specimens was evaluated. HSV negative samples and samples spiked to a test concentration of ${ \sim } 3 \mathrm { X }$ LoD of HSV-1 Macintyre virus or HSV-2 MS virus were tested. No interference in performance of the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay was observed in the presence of a representative brand of the following exogenous and endogenous substances at the concentrations stated in Table 8.

# g. Specimen Stability in Viral Transport Medium (VTM) and Aptima Specimen Transport Medium (STM)

The specimen stability was assessed with naturally occurring positive clinical specimens in both VTM (diluted in STM ) and neat STM that were placed at various temperatures over a period of time ( $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 30 days, $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 30 days, ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { \circ C } }$ for 60 days, and $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for 60 days) and subsequently tested with the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay.

In addition, each transport medium was spiked with HSV-1 MacIntyre strain and HSV-2 MS strain at 3X and 10X LoD and tested, in duplicate, at the following temperatures and intervals: $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for $\geq 3 0$ days, $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $\geq 3 0$ days, ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { \circ C } }$ for $\geq 3 0$ days and $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for $\geq 3 0$ days.

For the specimen freeze and thaw study, stability was assessed by alternately freezing specimens at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { \circ C } }$ or $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and then thawing at room temperature for a total of 3 additional freeze-thaw cycles before being tested again in the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay in duplicate.

The study data support the stability claims for HSV-1 and HSV-2 specimens collected in STM and stored at $2 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for up to 36 days and at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { \circ C } }$ to $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for up to 36 days. The study data also support the stability claims for HSV-1 and HSV-2

specimens collected in VTM, immediately transferred to STM, and then stored at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for up to 30 days and at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { \circ C } }$ to $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for up to 36 days. Specimens collected directly in STM or collected in VTM and then immediately transferred to STM may be frozen and thawed up to 3 times prior to testing.

# h. Competitive Inhibition

Competitive inhibition was evaluated to assess the ability of the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay to detect HSV 1 and HSV 2 analytes when both are present in the same specimen. Low and high titer concentrations of HSV-1 viral particles were tested in combination with low, moderate, and high concentrations of HSV-2 virus. Panel composition and concentrations are listed in Table 9. All testing resulted in $100 \%$ detection for both HSV-1 and HSV-2.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The clinical performance evaluation was performed against a composite reference method comprised of the ELVIS HSV ID and D3 Typing Test system viral culture and a validated PCR/ bidirectional sequencing procedure. A third FDA cleared assay was used when the ELVIS D3 culture and PCR/sequencing results did not agree on the type of HSV detected or when PCR/sequencing detected both HSV-1 and HSV-2. See Clinical Study Section below (Section 3).

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

The performance of the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay was compared with a composite reference method: the ELVIS HSV ID and D3 Typing Test System (Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc.; K091753), and a validated PCR/ bidirectional sequencing procedure. A third FDA cleared assay was used when the ELVIS D3 culture and PCR/sequencing results did not agree on the type of HSV detected or when PCR/sequencing detected both HSV-1 and HSV-2.

Note: The ELVIS D3 culture method cannot detect type HSV-1 if the sample is positive for HSV-2, thus, the method cannot detect HSV-1 and HSV-2 co-infected samples.

# Clinical Performance:

A prospective, multicenter clinical study was conducted to establish the performance characteristics of the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay. A total of 544 evaluable subjects (195 males and 349 females) with active anogenital lesions were enrolled from 17 US clinical sites, including family planning, dermatology, pediatrics/adolescent, sexually transmitted infection, private practice, public health clinics, hospitals, universities, and clinical research sites.

Two (2) swab specimens were collected from a single lesion from each subject: one was collected with a swab from a commercially available VTM collection kit and one was collected with a swab from the Aptima Multitest Swab Specimen Collection Kit (STM). Specimens were processed in accordance with the appropriate package insert instructions. Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay testing was performed at 3 external sites. The performance of the Aptima HSV-1 & 2 assay was evaluated relative to the composite reference method specified above. The performance of the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay was estimated for detection of HSV-1 and HSV-2 separately using each specimen type.

For HSV-1, of the 544 evaluable subjects, 528 VTM and 531 STM specimen types resulted in evaluable results for HSV-1 analysis (16 VTM and 13 STM were reported as unknown composite reference interpretation).For HSV-2, of the 544 evaluable subjects, 533 VTM and 535 STM specimen types produced evaluable results for HSV-2 analysis (11 VTM and 9 STM were reported as unknown composite reference interpretation).

The performance of the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay compared to the composite reference method for anogenital skin lesion specimens collected in STM and VTM is summarized in Tables 10 and 11. The overall sensitivity for HSV-1 was $9 3 . 4 \%$ for VTM and $9 4 . 7 \%$ for STM specimen types and the specificity was $9 9 . 8 \%$ for VTM and $9 9 . 6 \%$ for STM specimen types (Table 10). For HSV-2, the sensitivity was $9 6 . 9 \%$ for VTM and $9 8 . 4 \%$ for STM specimen types and the specificity was $9 7 . 5 \%$ for VTM and $9 2 . 8 \%$ for STM specimen types (Table 11).

# N. Instrument Name:

Panther system

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device?

Yes ____X____ or No

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?

Yes _ or No __X_

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes ___X_____ or No _

The sponsor states there have been no changes to the Panther system software since 2014 (version 5.2.0).

The assay software, version 2.25, originally used for the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay clinical studies was modified to a newer version (2.29) after the clinical reproducibility testing was completed. The modified assay software version 2.29 uses the same parameters as are planned to be used in the version for commercial use. Data generated from the Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay clinical testing sites were reprocessed using the new assay software version 2.29. Hologic reprocessed the data using a validated tool, which processes results in the same manner as the Panther system to demonstrate comparability between software versions.

3. Specimen Identification:

Patient ID/Sample ID is is labeled with a unique barcode, which is tracked by the software to prevent re-use and track positive sample identification.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling: Not Applicable

5. Calibration:

Real Time Fluorometers (RTF) undergo a single calibration during manufacturing. No additional calibration is performed by the end user.

6. Quality Control:

The internal control IC) consists of a random sequence of RNA unrelated to HSV and is introduced to each reaction during sample preparation. The IC is amplified in the same reaction as the HSV-1 and HSV-2 mRNA targets. It is used to determine the validity of each individual reaction and as an indicator of capture, amplification and/or detection inhibition, and detection step errors, as well as to control for operator and instrument errors.

Two controls are provided by Hologic to the user in the Aptima HSV Controls Kit: one HSV dual positive control and one negative control. The positive control is composed of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in-vitro transcript (IVT) at known concentrations. These controls must generate results within predefined specifications to be valid. The negative control is composed of a buffered solution and must also provide a valid negative result for the run to be valid. Additionally, both controls must generate IC results within a predefined specification.

A. Run Validity Criteria

The software automatically determines run validity. The software will invalidate a run if either or both controls (negative and positive) have invalid results.

A run may be invalidated by an operator if technical, operator, or instrument difficulties are observed and documented while performing the assay.

An invalid run must be repeated.

B. Control Validity

Table 15 defines the TTime validity criteria for the Negative and Positive Controls.
