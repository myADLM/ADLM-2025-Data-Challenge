Elecsys Toxo IgM Immunoassay

The Elecsys Toxo IgM immunoassay is for the in vitro qualitative detection of IgM antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii in human serum and plasma. This assay may be used as an aid in the diagnosis of an acute or recent Toxoplasmosis infection in suspected patients and pregnant women. Patient testing must be performed in conjunction with an antiToxoplasma gondii IgG antibody assay.

The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” is intended for use on Elecsys and cobas e immuno-assay analyzers. This assay has not been cleared by the FDA for blood/plasma donor screening.

PreciControl Toxo IgM

PreciControl Toxo IgM is used for quality control of the Elecsys Toxo IgM immunoassay on the Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.

2. Indication(s) for use: Same as intended use

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements: Elecsys 2010 and cobas e 411 analyzers

# I. Device Description:

The Elecsys Toxo IgM is a two-step sandwich immunoassay with streptavidin microparticles and electrochemiluminescence detection. In the first incubation, $1 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of sample is automatically prediluted 1:20 with Elecsys Diluent Universal, with $T .$ gondii-specific recombinant antigen labeled complex then added. Anti-Toxo IgM antibodies present in the sample react with the labeled T. gondii-specific recombinant antigen. Biotinylated monoclonal IgM specific antibodies and streptavidin-coated microparticles are subsequently added. The complex becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin. The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then removed with ProCell. Application of a voltage to the electrode then

induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier. Results are determined automatically by the Elecsys software by comparing the electrochemiluminescence signal obtained from the reaction. The assay can be run on either the Elecsys 2010 of the cobas e 411 analyzers platforms.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable – This assay is qualitative   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability:

There is no international standard available for measuring anti-Toxoplasma IgM in serum; therefore, calibrators are traceable to an in-house reference preparation.

# Calibrators

Calibration of an Elecsys Toxo IgM reagent lot is recommended every 28 days (1 month). Elecsys Toxo IgM reagent kits can be stored on-board the analyzers for up to 2 weeks. A new calibration of a kit kept on-board is recommended every 7 days

# Stability:

# Reagents

Reagent stability was determined by testing five human samples and two control samples. The results support the claim of reagent stability for 12 weeks of storage after first opening at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (not on board). Reagents are only stable on-board the analyzer up to 84 hours total time. The real-time data currently available supports a shelf-life claim of 14 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for unopened reagents.

# Calibrators

Calibrator stability was determined by testing the calibrators in duplicate once after first opening and once again after 8 weeks without loss of signal. The results support the claim of calibrator stability for 8 weeks of storage after first opening at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (not on board). Calibrators are also stable beyond 5 hrs. when tested every hour on board the analyzer at $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The data provided supports a $5 \mathrm { h r }$ . on-board stability claim. The real-time data currently available supports a shelf-life claim of 14 months at 2- $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ without opening.

# Controls

The PreciControl Toxo $\mathrm { I g M }$ is stable at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ after first opening for up to 8 weeks. The PreciControl Toxo IgM is stable for $5 \mathrm { h }$ under on-board conditions. The real-time data currently available supports a shelf-life claim of 14 months.

# Samples

Samples are stable are for 3 days at $1 5 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 3 weeks at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and 3 months at ${ \bf - } 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Expected values:

· Calibrator 1 is manufactured to have a target Index value range of 400 - 2500. $\bullet$ Calibrator 2 is manufactured to have a target Index value range of 4500 - 35000. $\bullet$ The negative control is manufactured to have a target Index value of $0 . 1 8 \mathrm { C O I ^ { \ast } }$ The positive control is manufactured to have a target Index value of $2 . 0 \mathrm { C O I ^ { * } }$ .

\*cutoff index (COI) is calculated as a ratio of sample signal over cutoff. The target Index value range for each control is reported in the rackpack or PerciControl kit to make sure that the correct target values are used.

d. Detection limit:

Not applicable – This assay is qualitative e. Analytical specificity:

Cross reactivity:

The cross-reactivity study for the Elecsys Toxo IgM assay was designed to evaluate potential interference from the presence of potentially cross-reactive antibodies or substances that may cause symptoms similar to or that may mimic Toxoplasmosis infection. Only samples that were sero-positive for the cross reactant and seronegative for Toxoplasma gondii IgM by a commercially available Toxoplasma lgM assay were used to test for potentially cross-reactive organisms. The results are summarized in table 3. below.

High-dose hook effect was evaluated by testing three samples with Toxoplasma gondii lgM levels out-of-range $> 6 4$ COI (i.e., $6 4 \mathrm { x }$ minimum positive value). In this study, three samples with very high Toxo $\mathrm { I g M }$ levels were serially diluted with negative sample to cover the entire assay range. The neat sample and dilutions were tested using one lot on one instrument. The signal obtained was plotted versus the dilution. The samples resulted in calculated concentration values above the measuring range with no sample misclassification, indicating no hook effect was observed.

# Interference

Testing was performed to determine whether the presence of endogenous or exogenous substances (compounds) may interfere with assay results. Matched sample pools (3 negative and 3 positive) were tested neat and spiked with the respective interferent. Acceptance criteria were defined as the $\%$ change in signal must not be more than $+ 2 0 \%$ and no change the qualitative result. The assay is unaffected at the concentration for each substance listed in Table 4 below on the Elecsys Toxo IgM assay.

f. Assay cut-off:

The cut-off for the Elecsys Toxo IgM assay was established by the use of 900 clinical samples from which a preliminary cutoff was set by ROC analysis. The results of the internal and external testing to evaluate the performance of the Elecsys Toxo IgM assay demonstrate that the cutoff of $1 . 0 \ : \mathrm { C O I }$ is appropriate to obtain good sensitivity and specificity.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison:

Studies were conducted to evaluate the suitability of the following 5 types of blood collection tubes; serum/gel separation tubes, lithium heparin plasma, $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ -EDTA plasma, $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 }$ -EDTA plasma and sodium citrate plasma. A minimum of 49 sample pairs were drawn into serum and plasma collection tubes. The recovery of the analyte in the presence of the anti-coagulant was compared to serum. The results indicate there was no difference between any of the plasma types when compared to serum.

\*For agreement calculation, equivocal results are counted as discrepant results against the Elecsys Toxo IgM. In case of unanimously equivocal samples, samples were not used for agreement calculation.

CDC Panel study:

A panel of 97 samples (32 known positive and 65 known negative) was obtained through the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and was tested for Toxo IgM on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer. The results are presented as agreement with the known results as additional information on the performance of this assay with a masked, characterized serum panel. This does not imply an endorsement of the assay by the CDC. The results of the CDC panel testing are sumerized below in Table 9.

4. Clinical cut-off: Non-reactive: $< 0 . 8$ COI

Equivocal: $\ge 0 . 8 \mathrm { ~ -- ~ } 1 . 0$ COI

Reactive: $\geq 1 . 0$ COI

Samples with a cutoff index $< 0 . 8$ are non-reactive in the Elecsys Toxo IgM assay.

Samples with a cutoff index between $\ge 0 . 8$ and $< 1 . 0$ are considered equivocal. The sample should be retested. In case the result is still equivocal, a second sample should be tested e.g. within 2-3 weeks. Samples with a cutoff index $\geq 1 . 0$ are reactive in the Elecsys Toxo IgM assay.
