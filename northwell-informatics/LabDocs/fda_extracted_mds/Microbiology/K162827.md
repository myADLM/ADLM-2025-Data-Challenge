# B. Device Name

Trade Name: VIDAS® B·R·A·H·M·S PCTTM (PCT)   
Common Name: Endotoxin Assay   
Classification Names: Device to detect and measure procalcitonin (pct) in human clinical specimens (21 CFR 866.3215, Product Code PMT) Procalcitonin assay (21 CFR 866.3215, Product Code PRI)

# C. Predicate Devices

VIDAS® B·R·A·H·M·S PCTTM (K160911)

# D. Device Description

The assay principle combines a one-step immunoassay sandwich method with a final fluorescent detection (ELFA).

The Solid Phase Receptacle $\mathsf { \Lambda } ( \mathsf { S P R } ^ { \otimes } )$ , serves as the solid phase as well as the pipetting device.   
Reagents for the assay are ready-to-use and pre-dispensed in the sealed reagent strips.

All of the assay steps are performed automatically by the instrument. The sample is transferred into the wells containing anti-procalcitonin antibodies labeled with alkaline phosphatase (conjugate). The sample/conjugate mixture is cycled in and out of the $\mathsf { S P R } ^ { \odot }$ several times. This operation enables the antigen to bind with the immunoglobulins fixed to the interior wall of the $\mathsf { S P R } ^ { \odot }$ and the conjugate to form a sandwich. Unbound compounds are eliminated during washing steps.

Two detection steps are performed successively. During each step, the substrate (4-Methylumbelliferyl phosphate) is cycled in and out of the $\mathsf { S P R } ^ { \mathfrak { P } }$ . The conjugate enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of this substrate into a fluorescent product (4-Methyl-umbelliferone) the fluorescence of which is measured at $4 5 0 \ \mathsf { n m }$ . The intensity of the fluorescence is proportional to the concentration of antigen present in the sample.

At the end of the assay, results are automatically calculated by the instrument in relation to two calibration curves corresponding to the two detection steps. A fluorescence threshold value determines the calibration curve to be used for each sample. The results are then printed out.

# E. Intended Use

# G. Nonclinical Tests

A summary of the non-clinical (analytical) results is presented below.

# Limits of detection and quantitation

The Limit of Blank (LoB), the Limit of Detection (LoD) and the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were determined on the VIDAS® and ${ \mathsf { V I D A S } } ^ { \otimes } { 3 }$ instruments according to the ${ \mathsf { C L S l } } ^ { \otimes }$ EP17-A2 recommendations. The limits reported below apply for all the instruments of the VIDAS family:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Limit of Blank (LoB)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.01 ng/mL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Limit of Detection (LoD)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.03 ng/mL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.05 ng/mL</td></tr></table>

The LoQ was determined to be $0 . 0 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ (with bias $\leq 1 0 \%$ , $\% \mathrm { C V } \leq 2 0 \%$ and Total Error $\leq 5 0 \%$ .)

# Precision

The study was performed according to the recommendations of $\mathsf { C L S l } ^ { \otimes }$ document EP5-A3. A panel of 11 human samples covering the measuring range were tested in duplicate in 2 runs per day, over 20 days using $3 ~ { \dot { \mathsf { V I D A S } } } ^ { \otimes }$ and $\mathsf { \overline { { 3 } } } \mathsf { \nabla } \mathsf { V I D A S } ^ { \otimes } 3$ instruments $N { = } 2 4 0$ values for each sample) at 3 sites (one instrument per site). Two reagent lots were used: 10 days of tests and 6 calibrations were performed for each lot. The repeatability, between-day precision, within-laboratory precision and reproducibility/total precision (between-laboratory precision) were estimated for each sample and are reported in the following tables:

# H. Clinical performance data

A summary of the clinical performance data is presented below.

# Decision making on antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected or confirmed LRTI

Two systematic literature reviews were performed along with study and patient-level meta-analyses, which are studies that combine and contrast data from multiple sources to identify patterns among study results. The study-level meta-analysis encompassed 11 randomized control trials (RCTs) which were published between 2004-2016, and included 4090 patients. The patient-level meta-analysis encompassed 13 RCTs which were published between 2004-2011, and included 3142 patients.

These meta-analyses concluded that PCT guided antibiotic therapy resulted in:

$1 9 . 2 \%$ reduction in relative antibiotic initiation for all patients   
$38 \%$ reduction in overall antibiotic exposure (i.e. total days of antibiotic therapy) for inpatients $51 \%$ reduction in overall antibiotic exposure (i.e. total days of antibiotic therapy) for patients in emergency departments\*   
2.9 day reduction in antibiotic duration [1.25 day reduction in study-level]   
3.6 day reduction in total antibiotic exposure [2.79 day reduction in study-level]   
No negative effects in regards to mortality, complications, or length of stay.

\*Patients who presented to the Emergency Department and other associated clinics, but were not admitted.

Additionally, a modified DOOR/RADAR analysis, in which patient outcomes were ranked by clinical severity, was conducted on the patient level data, and found that PCT-guided management had a statistically significant improvement in ranked patient outcomes compared to standard management.

# Decision making on antibiotic discontinuation for septic patients

Two systematic literature reviews were performed along with study and patient-level meta-analyses, which are studies that combine and contrast data from multiple sources to identify patterns among study results. The study-level meta-analysis encompassed 10 RCTs which were published between 2008-2016, and included 3489 patients. The patient-level meta-analysis encompassed 5 RCTs which were published between 2008-2010, and included 598 patients.

These meta-analyses concluded that PCT guided antibiotic therapy resulted in:

1.5 day reduction in antibiotic duration 3.2 day reduction in total antibiotic exposure • $23 \%$ reduction in overall antibiotic exposure (i.e. total days of antibiotic therapy) No negative effects in regards to mortality, hospital length of stay, or ICU length of stay.

# I. Conclusion

The results from the non-clinical and clinical performance data submitted in this premarket notification are complete and demonstrate that the VIDAS® B·R·A·H·M·S PCT assay is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
