# G. Regulatory Information:

1. Regulation section: 21 CFR 866.3215; Device to detect and measure non-microbial analyte(s) in human clinical specimens to aid in assessment of patients with suspected sepsis

2. Classification: Class II (Special Controls)

3. Product codes: PMT, PRI

4. Panel: 83 - (Microbiology)

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended Use:

VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT (PCT) is an automated test for use on the instruments of the VIDAS family for the determination of human procalcitonin in human serum or plasma (lithium heparinate) using the ELFA (Enzyme-Linked Fluorescent Assay) technique.

Used in conjunction with other laboratory findings and clinical assessments, VIDAS B•R•A•H•M•S PCT is intended for use as follows:

to aid in the risk assessment of critically ill patients on their first day of ICU admission for progression to severe sepsis and septic shock,   
· to aid in assessing the cumulative 28-day risk of all-cause mortality for patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock in the ICU or when obtained in the emergency department or other medical wards prior to ICU admission, using a change in PCT level over time,   
· to aid in decision making on antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected or confirmed lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) defined as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute bronchitis, and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) – in an inpatient setting or an emergency department,   
· to aid in decision making on antibiotic discontinuation for patients with suspected or confirmed sepsis.

2. Indications for use: Same as Intended Use.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

For prescription use only

Warnings and Precautions:

VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT (PCT) is not indicated to be used as a standalone diagnostic assay and should be used in conjunction with clinical signs and symptoms of infection and other diagnostic evidence. Decisions regarding antibiotic therapy should NOT be based solely on procalcitonin concentrations. PCT results should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical status of the patient and other laboratory results. Changes in PCT levels for the prediction of mortality, and overall mortality, are strongly dependent on many factors, including pre-existing patient risk factors and clinical course.

The need to continue ICU care at Day 4 and other covariates (e.g., age and SOFA score) are also significant predictors of 28-day cumulative mortality risk. Certain patient characteristics, such as severity of renal failure or insufficiency, may influence procalcitonin values and should be considered as potentially confounding clinical factors when interpreting PCT values. Increased PCT levels may be observed in severe illness such as polytrauma, burns, major surgery, prolonged or cardiogenic shock. PCT levels may not be elevated in patients infected by certain atypical pathogens, such as Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The safety and performance of PCT-guided therapy for individuals younger than age 17 years, pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals or those on immunomodulatory agents, was not formally analyzed in the supportive clinical trials.

# L. Test Principle:

The assay principle combines a one-step immunoassay sandwich method with a final fluorescent detection (ELFA). The Solid Phase Receptacle (SPR) serves as the solid phase as well as the pipetting device. Reagents for the assay are ready-to-use and predispensed in the sealed reagent strips. All of the assay steps are performed automatically by the instrument. The sample is transferred into the wells containing anti-procalcitonin antibodies labeled with alkaline phosphatase (conjugate). The sample/conjugate mixture is cycled in and out of the SPR several times. This operation enables the antigen to bind with the immunoglobulins fixed to the interior wall of the SPR and the conjugate to form a sandwich. Unbound compounds are eliminated during washing steps.

Two detection steps are performed successively. During each step, the substrate (4- Methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate) is cycled in and out of the SPR. The conjugate enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of this substrate into a fluorescent product (4-Methylumbelliferone) the fluorescence of which is measured at $4 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . The intensity of the fluorescence is proportional to the concentration of antigen present in the sample. At the end of the assay, results are automatically calculated by the instrument in relation to two calibration curves corresponding to the two detection steps. A fluorescence threshold value determines the calibration curve to be used for each sample. The results are then printed out.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

# 1. Analytical performance

Most analytical performance metrics of the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT (PCT) assay were previously established in K071146 and K160911, and are not affected by the additional claims. (K071146 was one of two predicates for K160911.) Supplementary analytical studies were performed to support the new claims. These include:

Precision –VIDAS instrument   
· Precision – VIDAS 3 instrument   
· Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) Interference Testing

# · Reproducibility/Precision:

The purpose of this study was to supplement previous precision studies (submitted in K071146 and K160911) to more fully establish performance at the low end of the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT (PCT) assay measuring range. For both the VIDAS and VIDAS 3, the precision panel consisted of five frozen human serum samples to provide additional coverage between $0 . 0 5 - 0 . 2 5$ $\mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ for the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT (PCT) assay. The precision was evaluated on VIDAS and VIDAS 3 instruments over 20 days at three internal labs acting as three testing sites (2 R&D labs and 1 Clinical Affairs lab). The study was designed based on CLSI EP5-A3 "Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative Measurement Procedures; Approved guideline – Third Edition.”

The following variation sources were taken into account in the evaluation: replicate, run, day, calibration, reagent lot, instrument and site. Each precision sample was tested in 2 replicates, in 2 runs per day by trained operators for 20 days on the VIDAS (and VIDAS 3) instruments installed at the three testing sites. Two reagent lots were used (10 testing days per reagent lot). For each lot, two separate calibration events were performed (5 testing days per calibration event and per lot) with total of 6 calibrations per lot (3 consecutive calibrations per calibration event). Data analyses were performed for each sample separately, by site and for all sites combined, as follows:

· Variance components (SD and $\% C V$ ) were estimated using the REML method,   
· Variance components were combined to yield estimates of the precision characteristics, $9 5 \%$ CI for overall precision estimates were computed according to Chi-square method and Satterthwaite degrees of freedom.

Precision-VIDAS instrument: For the VIDAS instrument, one highly discordant value on sample PP13 was observed during the study. The highly discordant result was treated as a statistical outlier and analyses both with and without the highly discordant values was performed. The outlier largely affected the repeatability estimates for sample PP13; the outlier increased the $\% \mathrm { C V } + 1 8 . 4 \%$ $( 8 . 5 \%$ to $2 6 . 9 \%$ ) locally at site 1 and $+ 8 . 8 \%$ $9 . 8 \%$ to $1 8 . 6 \%$ ) globally. A precision profile analysis demonstrated the outlier introduced bias into the precision estimates of sample PP13. The precision results without the outlier were considered as the unbiased estimates of precision and as the definitive estimates. Precision estimates were uniform across the 3 sites for all samples, so the 3 sites were combined to produce more robust precision estimates. The precision performance characteristics of the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT (PCT) assay for the five samples tested are indicated in the following table.

Precision VIDAS 3 instrument: For the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT (PCT) assay on the VIDAS 3 instrument, one highly discordant value on PP12 was observed during the study. The highly discordant result was treated as a statistical outlier and analyses both with and without the highly discordant value were performed. The outlier affected the repeatability estimates for sample PP12 by increasing $\% \mathrm { C V }$ to $+ 7 9 . 5 \%$ ( $1 3 . 1 \%$ to $9 2 . 6 \%$ ) locally at site 3 and $+ 4 4 . 9 \%$ ( $1 2 . 7 \%$ to $5 7 . 6 \%$ ) globally. The precision results without the outlier were considered as the unbiased estimates of precision and as the definitive

estimates. Precision estimates were uniform across the three sites for all samples, so the 3 sites were combined to produce more robust precision estimates.

# · Linearity/Assay Reportable Range:

See K160911: Linearity was confirmed in the range of $0 . 0 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ to 200 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The measuring range claim for the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT (PCT) assay is $0 . 0 5 - 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . For PCT concentrations greater than $2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , the measurement range can be extended up to $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ by one 1:10 dilution of the sample.

Due to an administrative error, the measuring range was previously stated as 0.02 – 100 ng/mL.

· Detection Limit:

LoB and LoD determination – See K160911: Same as predicate.

Limit of Quantitation:

The Total Error (TE), bias and precision CV was evaluated for PCT concentrations at the lower end of the assay measuring range $( 0 . 0 3 - 0 . 3 0 $ $\mathrm { n g / m L } )$ including the 2 proposed clinical decision cut-offs for the LRTI claim (0.10 and $0 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ).The study was based upon CLSI EP17-A2 guideline “Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline, Second Edition”. Seven low-level samples covering the lower end of the measuring range (0.03 to $0 . 3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ were prepared by dilution of PCT Standards used for Master Calibration in human serum. The samples were tested in 32 replicates (8 replicates per day for 4 days) on one VIDAS and one VIDAS 3 instruments using one VIDAS $\mathrm { B } { \cdot } \mathrm { R } { \cdot } \mathrm { A } { \cdot } \mathrm { H } { \cdot } \mathrm { M } { \cdot } \mathrm { S }$ PCT (PCT) reagent lot. Two calibrations were performed on each instrument, with 2 days of test per calibration. The data analysis process included, for each low level sample, the detection/treatment of outlier and the evaluation of the $\%$ bias, $\% \mathrm { C V }$ and $\%$ TE (Westgard model). These results were interpreted with respect to the two medical cut-offs values and the current LoQ at $0 . 0 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

· Matrix Equivalency Study: See K160911. Same as predicate. Analytical Specificity/ Cross-Reactivity: See K160911. Same as predicate.

· Interfering Substances:

Interfering substances were evaluated using the VIDAS B.R.A.H.M.S PCT (PCT) assay with four serum substances (bilirubin, hemoglobin, lipids and human albumin) and 36 exogenous substances (drugs). The Interference studies followed the principles of CLSI EP7-A2 guideline, “Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline - Second edition”. The study was carried out on one VIDAS instrument with one VIDAS B.R.A.H.M.S PCT (PCT) lot at four different concentrations of procalcitonin:

• $\mathrm { \sim } 0 . 1 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ corresponding to a clinical decision value for Low Respiratory Tract Infection   
b $\mathrm { \hbar \sim 0 . 2 0 \ n g / m L }$ close to the clinical decision value for Low Respiratory Tract Infection   
• ${ \sim } 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ corresponding to a clinical decision value for sepsis   
• $\mathrm { \sim 1 5 0 n g / m L }$ close to the high level of the measuring range

The effect of interfering substances on assay performance was established for all combinations of serum substances, potential interferents and PCT concentrations.

Serum substances: When tested at procalcitonin levels A, B, C and D, bilirubin, hemoglobin and triglycerides demonstrated no significant interference at the tested concentrations, which were $3 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $( 5 7 4 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } )$ , $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $( 3 4 7 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } )$ , and $3 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ respectively. When tested at a concentration of $9 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , human albumin demonstrated:

At procalcitonin level A: acceptance criteria not met, interference resulted in decreased procalcitonin values.   
At procalcitonin level B, C and D: acceptance criteria met; no significant interference observed.

Further evaluation of human albumin was conducted. No significant interference was observed up to the human albumin concentration of 6500 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , including intrinsic human albumin of the sample. Above this concentration, the interference decreases the measured procalcitonin concentration.

No significant interference was observed for all the tested serum substances and exogenous substances (drugs) at the concentrations indicated in the following tables:

For the cut-offs 0.25, 0.50, and $2 . 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , the percent agreements between KRYPTOR and VIDAS were acceptable. The kappa coefficients were ${ > } 0 . 8 7$ demonstrating agreement between both assays at these cut-offs.

For the $0 . 1 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ cut-off, the overall percent agreement between KRYPTOR and VIDAS was $8 6 . 7 \%$ which was considered acceptable, with the understanding that discordant results did not differ by more than one level (for example, a sample inferior to $0 . 1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ with VIDAS was not higher than $0 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ with KRYPTOR). The kappa coefficient was 0.7309, and did not conform to the acceptance criteria. However, this result was considered acceptable as a kappa coefficient above 0.61 represents acceptable agreement. These study results showed some amount of disagreement between two assays around cutoff 0.1 and 0.25.

# 2. Clinical Studies

To establish performance of the device for use as an aid in decision making on antibiotic therapy for LRTI and sepsis, systematic literature reviews were performed with both study and patient-level data. The meta-analyses were conducted after comprehensive publication searches of the PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews with the selection of articles defined by a standardized set of inclusion and exclusion criteria, established prior to the literature search. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment tool was used to assess the quality of the publications included in the final meta-analyses. To assess for the presence of bias, funnel plots were constructed and did not identify visual evidence of publication bias. The study data were analyzed according to a pre-specified statistical analysis plan, using both fixed and random effects models.

In lieu of diagnostic accuracy, the primary endpoints of the meta-analysis included antibiotic exposure, initiation and duration. Safety endpoints were evaluated including mortality, complications and hospital length of stay. For LRTI, eleven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 4,090 subjects were included in the studylevel analysis, and thirteen RCTs with 3,142 subjects were included in the patientlevel analysis. Overall, PCT-guided therapy resulted in a $1 9 . 2 \%$ reduction in relative antibiotic initiation, a 1.25 – 2.9 day reduction in antibiotic duration, 2.79 – 3.6 day reduction in antibiotic exposure, without a significant increases in mortality, complications or hospital length of stay.

\*The # of patients evaluated indicates the total number of patients included in the evaluation. \*\*Antibiotic use is defined as the combination of the data from: antibiotic exposure (5 RCTs), antibiotic duration (3 RCTs) and 1 RCT whose definition (exposure or duration) was unclear. $^ { \ast \ast \ast }$ Mortality was defined per the individual RCT from which the data was extracted.

PCT-guided therapy resulted in decreased antibiotic use in patients with CAP, acute bronchitis and AECOPD. For inpatients, there was a $3 8 \%$ decrease in antibiotic exposure and $51 \%$ reduction in antibiotic exposure in patients from the Emergency Department (Figure 1). All studies allowed clinicians to override the PCT algorithm if they felt a patient needed antibiotics. Among the subset of studies that reported adherence to the PCT algorithm, adherence ranged from 59 – $91 \%$ . Adherence-adjusted outcomes were examined as part of the statistical analysis plan, and did not identify significant differences between studies. During the patient-level data analysis, subjects who did not have LRTI were excluded (e.g. URI, sepsis, etc.). Additional analyses of outpatient subpopulations were conducted, but it was concluded that the studies were not generalizable and therefore could not validate the proposed intended use claims. Outpatient data, with the exception of that which was acquired from patents in the emergency department, was subsequently excluded from further analysis.

Figure 1: Reduction in Antibiotic Exposure in LRTI patients (patient-level data)   
Figure 1A compares patients managed with standard of care to PCT-guided therapy in inpatients; Figure 1B compares patients managed with standard of care to PCT-guided therapy in Emergency Department patients Taken from slide CO-61 from BMx Presentation during November 10, 2016 Microbiology Devices Panel Meeting.

A modified Desirability of Outcome Ranking/Response Adjusted for Days of Antibiotic Risk (DOOR/RADAR) analysis was conducted on the LRTI data. Patient outcomes were ranked as follows: 7 - death; 6 - ICU admission within 30 days; 5 - Disease-specific complications within 30 days; 4 - Rehospitalization within 30 days of entry into the study; 3 - Recurrent or worsening of infection within 30 days; 2 - Symptoms of ongoing infection within 30 days; 1 - No symptoms of ongoing infection within 30 days. Patients with a similar RADAR rank were considered to have a better outcome if they had a shorter duration of antibiotic therapy. The DOOR/RADAR analysis demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in outcomes for PCT-guided therapy for all patients and patient subpopulations.

The safety analysis of PCT-guided therapy did not identify increases in mortality, complications or hospital length of stay. Complications were defined as ICU admissions, hospitalization or re-hospitalization, recurrent or worsening infection, acute respiratory infection-specific complications and death. No clinical subpopulations demonstrated a difference in the safety of PCT-guided therapy for inpatients or patients managed in the Emergency Room. The data were insufficient to draw conclusions for the proposed use in outpatients.

\*Length of stay patient data (n of 23 for standard care and n of 28 for PCT guided) was not collected for 2 RCTs (33, 36) \*\*Effect could not be estimated due to missing outcomes.

Due to an administrative error, the N on the last line of Table 13 (No baseline PCT value available, Standard Care Therapy) was previously stated as 20 instead of 38.

For sepsis, ten RCTs and 3,489 subjects were included in the study-level analysis, and five RCTs with 598 subjects were included in the patient-level analysis. Overall, PCT-guided therapy produced a 1.5 day reduction in antibiotic duration and a 3.2 day reduction in antibiotic exposure, without increases in mortality, complications or ICU/hospital length of stay.

\*The # of patients evaluated indicates the total number of patients included in the evaluation. \*\*Mortality was defined per the individual RCT from which the data was extracted. $^ { \ast \ast \ast }$ Four patients evaluated for mortality were not evaluated for ICU length of stay.

PCT-guided therapy resulted in decreased antibiotic duration and exposure. There was a $23 \%$ reduction in antibiotic exposure in septic patients managed with PCT (Figure 2). All studies allowed clinicians to override the PCT algorithm, if they felt a patient needed antibiotics. Among the subset of studies that reported adherence, the adherence ranged from $47 - 9 1 \%$ . Adherence-adjusted outcomes were examined as part of the statistical analysis plan, and did not identify significant differences between studies. For the patient-level data, subjects who did not meet inclusion criteria were excluded.

Due to an administrative error, the adherence rate was previously stated as $47 \%$ instead of $47 - 9 { \cal I } \%$ .

\*Length of stay patient data (n of 23 for standard care and n of 28 for PCT guided) was not collected for 2 RCTs (33, 36) \*\*Effect could not be estimated due to missing outcomes.

An additional analysis was conducted comparing published literature using the VIDAS to other PCT assays where no significant difference was observed. Other analyses included stratification by risk of bias (random effects vs. fixed effects model), year of publication, PCT algorithm adherence, primary diagnosis and definition of antibiotic exposure. Meta-regressions were performed to determine if individual studies or study characteristics had a significant effect were conducted, as well as sensitivity analyses for the effect of individual studies. No trends were observed in the meta-regressions and stratifications, although the small number of studies limited the conclusions that could be drawn.

3. Warnings and Precautions:

The following warnings and precautions were included within the package insert.   
References to the published literature are provided for each.

Some patient characteristics, such as severity of renal failure or insufficiency, may influence procalcitonin values and should be considered as potentially confounding clinical factors when interpreting PCT values.

The effects of renal failure on procalcitonin values are unclear from a review of the literature. Some literature suggests that severe renal failure may significantly increase procalcitonin values, however, this remains an area for further investigation.

PCT levels may not be elevated in patients infected by certain atypical pathogens, such as Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

A previous study of 106 patients with viral and atypical bacterial infections found the median PCT value to be $0 . 0 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (IQR 0.06 – 0.17). Other studies of atypical organisms have suggested also that PCT values can be low or only mildly elevated compared to typical bacterial infections. The lack of specificity for viral and atypical pathogens may represent a further confounding factor for the clinical interpretation of PCT values.

4. Clinical Cut-offs:

The following cut-offs are unchanged from prior 510(k) submissions.

a. 28-day mortality:

$\Delta \mathbf { P C T } \leq 8 0 \%$   
A decrease in the PCT levels below or equal to $80 \%$ defines a positive ΔPCT test result representing a higher risk for 28-day all-cause   
mortality of patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock. $\Delta \mathrm { P C T } > 8 0 \%$   
A decrease in the PCT levels of more than $80 \%$ defines a negative ΔPCT test result representing a lower risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock.

# b. Progression Risk:

$\mathbf { P C T } > 2 \mathbf { \ n g / m L }$   
A PCT level above $2 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ on the first day of ICU admission is associated with a high risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.   
PCT $\mathbf { < 0 . 5 \ n g / m L }$   
A PCT level below $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ on the first day of ICU admission is associated with a low risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.

c. LRTI Antibiotic Decision Making:

$\mathbf { P C T < 0 . 1 0 \ n g / m L }$   
Antibiotic therapy strongly discouraged. PCT $\mathbf { 0 . 1 0 { - } 0 . 2 5 \ n g / m L }$   
Antibiotic therapy discouraged.   
PCT $\mathbf { 0 . 2 6 { - 0 . 5 0 } \ n g / m L }$   
Antibiotic therapy encouraged.   
PCT $\mathrm { > } 0 . 5 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$   
Antibiotic therapy strongly encouraged. $\mathbf { P C T \leq 0 . 2 5 \ n g / m L }$   
Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued $\Delta \mathrm { P C T } > 8 0 \%$   
Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued

d. Sepsis Antibiotic Discontinuation:

$\Delta \mathrm { P C T } > 8 0 \%$   
Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued $\mathbf { P C T \leq 0 . 5 0 \ n g / m L }$   
Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued

Due to an administrative error, the cut-off for LRTI antibiotic discontinuation $( P C T \leq$ 0.25 ng/mL or $\Delta P C T > 8 0 \%$ were originally omitted.

# 5. Expected Values/Reference Range:

See K160911. A study was performed using the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT (PCT) test on serum samples from apparently healthy male $\left( \mathrm { N } { = } 9 8 \right)$ and female $( \mathrm { N } { = } 1 0 2 )$ subjects. The normal values corresponding to the $9 \dot { 5 } ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ and $9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentiles were $< 0 . 0 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $0 . 0 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ respectively.
