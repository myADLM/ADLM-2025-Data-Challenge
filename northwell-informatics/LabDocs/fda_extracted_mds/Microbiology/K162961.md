Dear Mr. Walter:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

The LIAISON® VCA IgG assay uses chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) technology on the LIAISON® Analyzer family for the qualitative determination of specific IgG antibodies to EpsteinBarr virus (EBV) viral capsid antigen (VCA) p18 synthetic peptide in human serum.

The LIAISON® VCA IgG Serum Control Set (negative and positive) consists of liquid ready-touse controls in human serum/defibrinated plasma. The negative control is intended to provide an assay response characteristic of negative patient specimens and the positive control is intended to provide an assay response characteristic of positive patient specimens.

The controls are designed for use with DiaSorin LIAISON® VCA IgG assay on the LIAISON® Analyzer family.

# INTENDED USE:

The LIAISON® VCA IgG assay uses chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) technology on the LIAISON® Analyzer family\* for the qualitative determination of specific IgG antibodies to EpsteinBarr virus (EBV) viral capsid antigen (VCA) p18 synthetic peptide in human serum. When performed in conjunction with other EBV markers, this assay can be used as an aid in the clinical laboratory diagnosis of Epstein-Barr Viral Syndrome in patients with signs and symptoms of EBV infection such as infectious mononucleosis.

The DiaSorin $\mathsf { L I A l S O N } ^ { \textregistered }$ VCA IgG Serum Control Set is intended for use as assayed quality control samples to monitor the performance of the LIAISON® VCA IgG assay on the LIAISON® Analyzer family\*.

# SUMMARY OF PERFORMANCE DATA:

Non-clinical verification and validation testing conducted with the $\mathsf { L I A l S O N } ^ { \textregistered }$ VCA IgG and LIAISON® VCA IgG Serum Control Set demonstrate that the modified device meets predetermined acceptance criteria, supporting equivalency of the modified device to the cleared device. Evidence is demonstrated through the following studies:

Testing of the LIAISON® VCA IgG Serum Control Set to validate and verify:

Commutability between samples and controls (matrix effect)   
Precison equivalence between samples and controls o 20 day precison   
Control value assignment   
Control range definition

Real Time Stability testing conducted on the LIAISON® VCA IgG Serum Control Set to support the following product claims:

• Shelf-life of 12 months at $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ Eight (8) weeks open use stability when stored at ${ 2 / 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } }$ between uses

Based on the results from the validation and verification activities, the modifications to the LIAISON® VCA IgG Serum Control Set do not introduce any new risks to the performance of the device.

# CONCLUSION:

As summarized, LIAISON® VCA IgG and LIAISON® VCA IgG Serum Control Set is substantially equivalent to the originally cleared device. The changes to the device do not constitute new intended/indications for use, or changes to the fundamental scientific technology. Performance testing of the device demonstrates that the device functions as intended, meeting the requirements of design specifications. The device was determined to be substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.

The material submitted in this Special 510(k) is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision. The labeling satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR 809.10.
