4. Special instrument requirements: VITEK $^ { \mathfrak { B } } 2$ and VITEK $^ { \mathfrak { B } } 2$ Compact Systems

# I. Device Description:

The ${ \mathrm { V I T E K } } ^ { \mathfrak { B } } 2$ AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 2 }$ AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials combined with the nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with $0 . 4 5 \%$ to $0 . 5 0 \%$ saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The ${ \mathrm { V I T E K } } ^ { \mathfrak { P } } 2$ System will automatically dilute the bacterial suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then the ${ \dot { \operatorname { V I T E K } } } ^ { \mathbb { B } } 2$ will fill, seal and place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK® 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing and loading operation. The VITEK ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 2 }$ Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time (up to 24 hours for Streptococcus Species). The analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based on attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the anti-microbial agent. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.

VITEK $^ { \mathfrak { B } } 2$ AST-GN Tigecycline has the following concentrations in the card: 1.5, 4 and 8 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ ). The MIC result range for the VITEK $^ { \mathfrak { B } } 2$ is $\leq 0 . 5 - \geq 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

# L. Test Principle:

The ${ \mathrm { V I T E K } } ^ { \textregistered } 2$ and ${ \mathrm { V I T E K } } ^ { \mathbb { B } } 2$ Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics used in the systems use visible light to directly measure organism growth. Transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through the well. The VITEK $^ { \mathfrak { P } } 2$ System monitors the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time. An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a “rapid” read but may be extended to 18 hours in some instances. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antibiotic on the card.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A reproducibility study was conducted at three sites using ten isolates of gramnegative bacilli that were consistent with the intended use. Isolates were tested in triplicate over three days for a total of 270 data points. The isolates tested in the reproducibility study included Enterobacter cloacae (two isolates), Enterobacter aerogenes (two isolates), Serratia marcescens (three isolates), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (three isolates). Inocula were prepared both manually and using automatic dilution for testing in the VITEK2. Inocula were prepared manually for testing in the VITEK2 Compact. The mode MIC value was determined and the reproducibility was calculated based on MIC values falling within $+ / - 1$ dilution of the mode MIC value.

Using VITEK2 and automatic dilution, best case reproducibility was $9 9 . 6 \%$ ; worst case reproducibility was $9 9 . 3 \%$ .

Using VITEK2 and manual dilution, all results were on scale and the reproducibility was $100 \%$ .

Using VITEK $^ { \mathfrak { B } } 2$ Compact and manual dilution, best case reproducibility was $9 9 . 6 \%$ worst case reproducibility was $9 7 . 8 \%$ .

The reproducibility results were acceptable.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: N/A   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Inoculum Density Check. The inoculum density was monitored using the DensiCHEK Plus™ instrument. The DensiCHEK Plus™ was standardized weekly with all results recorded and in expected range.

Purity Check: A purity check of all organisms was performed at the time of VITEK2 card inoculation. Only results obtained with pure cultures were evaluated.

Growth Failure Rate: During the course of the study there were no growth failures in the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative cards.

Quality Control Testing. The CLSI-recommended QC organism ( $E .$ . coli ATCC 25922) was tested using both the VITEK 2 card and the reference method at each site using both the automatic dilution and manual dilution methods for the VITEK 2 and using the manual dilution method for the VITEK 2 Compact.

The expected range for $E .$ . coli ATCC 25922 with tigecycline is $0 . 0 3 - 0 . 2 5 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . The tigecycline concentrations included in the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card are 1.5, 4, and $8 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ and the reporting range is $\leq 0 . 5 - \geq 8 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . Therefore, all results for the QC strain were off-scale for the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems and were reported as $\leq 0 . 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ (Table 2). In response to an FDA request for additional information regarding production and process controls to verify the performance of the device, the sponsor indicated that no other QC strains suitable for the Enterobacteriaceae claim could be identified that would cover the expected tigecycline MIC ranges based on CLSI or FDA drug label. Therefore, there was no specific recommendation for any additional QC strains to be tested, but the sponsor’s internal QC process assures that the devices are produced and manufactured appropriateley. Furthermore, and to inform the end-user of this point, the sponsor included the following footnote to the QC table in the device labeling:

“The VITEK 2 Gram Negative tigecycline does not include the full CLSI/FDArecommended dilution ranges for QC testing with this organism.”

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Results obtained with the bioMerieux VITEK AST – Gram Negative card with tigecycline were compared to result obtained with the CLSI broth microdilution reference panel. The VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card with tigecycline contains the following concentrations of tigecycline: 1.5, 4 and $8 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ (equivalent standard

method concentration by efficacy in $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ ) and the reporting range is ${ \underline { { < 0 . 5 } } } - { \underline { { > } } } 8$ $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . The reference panel contained two-fold serial dilutions with a range of 0.0156 to $3 2 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

Test inocula were standardized using the DensiCHEK Plus instrument. VITEK 2 AST – Gram Negative cards were inoculated using automatic dilution (for reading on the VITEK 2 instrument) or using a manual dilution method (for reading on the VITEK 2 instrument or on the VITEK 2 COMPACT instrument). Reference panels were inoculated as outlined in the CLSI document M07-A9.

A total of 637 Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates were evaluated at three sites with VITEK 2 AST – Gram Negative cards inoculated by automatic dilution and interpreted using the VITEK 2 instrument. The majority of isolates were fresh (569 isolates, $89 \%$ ); 68 isolates $( 1 1 \% )$ were stock isolates.

A total of 75 challenge isolates were tested at one site. The challenge set was tested with both card inoculation options (automatic dilution and manual dilution) on the VITEK 2 system and with the manual dilution on the VITEK 2 Compact system.

For MICs interpreted using the VITEK 2 system an inoculated using the automatic dilution method, the combined results from the clinical and challenge testing demonstrated a combined EA of $9 8 . 9 \%$ and CA of $9 8 . 6 \%$ (Table 3). A total of 96 isolates were determined to have evaluable results; the EA of the evaluable results was $9 1 . 7 \%$ . There were 2 major errors $( 0 . 3 \% )$ and no very major errors identified. The performance based on combined clinical and challenge data was acceptable.

EA – Essential Agreement $( + / - 2$ dilutions) min – minor discrepancies CA – Category Agreement maj – major discrepancies EVAL – Evaluable isolates vmj – very major discrepancies R or NS – Resistant or non-susceptible isolates

Essential agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the results of the reference method and that of VITEK2 test card within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are on scale for both the VITEK2 test card and the reference method. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the VITEK2 test card.

Challenge isolates interpreted using the VITEK2 and inoculated using the manual dilution method demonstrated an EA of $9 8 . 7 \%$ and a CA of $9 4 . 7 \%$ (Table 4). A total of 17 isolates were determined to have evaluable results; the EA of the evaluable results was $9 4 . 1 \%$ . There were no major or very major errors identified.

Only two resistant isolates were tested with this device, one clinical isolate and one challenge isolate. Due to the lack of available resistant isolates at the time of comparative testing the sponsor was asked to include the following limitation in their device labeling:

The ability of the AST card to detect resistance with the following combination(s) is unknown because resistant strains were not available at the time of comparative testing:

Tigecycline: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumonia, Citrobacter koseri, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens

Trending. Analysis of trending of MIC values indicated that overall for all Enterobacteriaceae no trending was observed. However, when evaluated by species MICs for $K .$ . pneumoniae tended to be one dilution higher than the reference method and MICs for S. marcescens tended to be one dilution lower than the reference method. The following footnote to the performance table was added to the device labeling.

Overall VITEK 2 Tigecycline MICs showed no trending. However, compared to reference broth microdilution, K. pneumoniae results tended to be one dilution higher; results for S. marcescens tended to be one dilution lower.
