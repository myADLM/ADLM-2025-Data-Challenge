# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not applicable

# L. Test Principle:

The test principle for the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test is described in detail under the K132270.

The swab sample collection kit, which is the subject of this submission, is designed to preserve the integrity of the Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae DNA in gynecological specimens collected from female patients.

Cells in the collected specimens are lysed in the collection device by the chaotropic agent in the cobas® PCR Media. The guanidine hydrochloride denatures all proteins in the sample, preventing any enzymatic degradation of the nucleic acid in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The performance characteristics of the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test were established under K132270; please refer to that file for the associated data.

A risk analysis was performed to evaluate the modification made to the collection kit and its impact on the performance of the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test. The FMEA identified one significant risk from the change from a spun swab to a flocked swab. The risk identified was a risk of a false negative result if the collected swab sample did not contain enough cells due to the design change from spun to flocked.

Two analytical studies using clinical samples were performed to demonstrate that the flocked swab was substantially equivalent to the spun swab for the endocervical specimens.

1. Analytical performance:

a. Dilution Sensitivity Study:

This study’s purpose was to demonstrate that clinical samples co-collected with Puritan woven swab and Puritan flocked swab have similar detection levels in serial dilutions using clinical matrix. This study was performed using the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 according to the instructions for use.

Method: Ten pairs of co-collected clinical specimens were selected based on positivity for CT or NG and $\mathrm { C t }$ values within $1 \ : \mathrm { C t }$ of each other, based on testing with the cobas® CT/NG $\mathbf { v } 2 . 0$ assay. See Table 1 below for the obtained specimen Ct values. Two negative background matrix pools were prepared from previously tested negative specimens. One negative pool was made for each swab type. Each swab of the ten positive pairs of cocollected specimens was diluted in the appropriate negative matrix pool. A minimum of eight dilution levels were made for each specimen and swab type.

\*this specimen exhibited one cycle (Ct value) difference suggesting approximately 2 fold N. gonorrhoeae DNA concentration difference even before dilution series were prepared. The specimen was included in the study despite being exactly at the borderline of inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Results: Each dilution was tested with the cobas $^ { \mathrm { 3 } } \mathrm { C T } / \mathrm { N G } \mathrm { v } 2 . 0$ assay in triplicate. The first dilution where 2 out of 3 replicates were negative was considered the dilution limit. The limit for each dilution of each swab sample was recorded in Table 2 below. The new flocked swab performed equally or better than the original woven swab in detecting CT or NG. One sample, 1006, had disparate dilution limits for each swab type, however the newer swab type (flocked swab) performed better than the original woven swab. No demonstrated negative impact was observed when using a flocked swab as compared to a woven swab. Equivalence was defined as both swabs having a dilution limit within one dilution of each other.

\*Sample 1006 exhibited negatives at more than one dilution level which was not unexpected considering that the starting concentration of $N .$ .gonorrhoeae DNA was already 2 fold different even before the dilution series were prepared. More importantly, signal loss was observed at a higher dilution in the specimen collected with proposed flocked swab device suggesting that this swab had no negative impact on the results.

# b. Method comparison with predicate device:

A swab comparison study was performed to demonstrate that the flocked swab has equivalent performance to the woven swab when used with the cobas® CT/NG v2.0 Test in a clinical environment. One woven and one flocked swab were prospectively collected from 1,949 women who came in to the clinical facility for STI testing. The swab type collected first was alternated between the two swab types.

The comparison of the two swab types is presented as Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) and Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) between results obtained with the flocked swab vs. the woven swab for positive and negative patients. Table 3 (CT) and Table 4 (NG) below show the results of this study.

All discordant samples were at or near the limit of detection with a $\mathrm { C t }$ value above 35, except for one Chlamydia trachomatis positive specimen which was positive in the flocked swab only with a Ct value of 25.

The performance of the two Puritan swabs (woven and flocked) used for collection of endocervical specimens for testing on the cobas® 4800 platform with CT/NG v2.0 are not significantly different. A Student’s t-test was performed on the data resulting in a p-value of 0.92 for Chlamydia trachomatis and 0.84 for Neisseria gonorrhoeae demonstrating no significant difference between the swab types. Although the PPA point estimate for Chlamydia trachomatis results $( 9 4 . 3 \% )$ and Neisseria gonorrhoeae $( 8 6 . 9 6 \% )$ were below the desirable $9 5 \%$ goal, the data provided do not raise concerns with the use of the flocked swab instead of the woven swab for the collection of endocervical specimens and support a substantially equivalent decision.
