L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

The performance characteristics of the Greiner Vacuette Urine CCM tubes were determined using organism recovery (i.e., viability) studies. The bacteria listed in Table 1 below were evaluated in this study. The organisms evaluated were representatives from bacterial species that are usually associated with urinary tract infections. Inoculation and organism recovery studies conducted in accordance with the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M40-A2 document.

To perform viability studies, organisms were diluted from $1 . 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ (equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard) down then spiked into pooled filter sterilized urine to get a final concentration of $1 . 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } \mathrm { { i 0 } ^ { 4 } }$ , $1 . 5 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 3 }$ , and $1 . 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ i 0 ^ { 2 } ~ C F U / m L }$ . The spiked urine samples were then placed in their respective Greiner Vacuette Urine CCM tubes in triplicates and held for 0, 24, 48 hours at room temperature $( 2 0 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and at refrigerated temperature $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . At the designated time intervals, the Greiner Vacuette Urine CCM tubes were removed from storage and $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ from each urine tube was removed and plated. The average plate count results from the organism recovery study are shown in Table 1 below. Demonstrating that the recovered organism concentration is within $+ / - 1$ log of the original spiked concentration is considered acceptable performance. The data provided shows that acceptable performance was demonstrated for all organisms tested.

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not Applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Shelf life: The shelf life for the Greiner Vacuette Urine CCM tube is 14 months after the date of manufacture. The stability of the vacuum tubes was performed on a total of five lots of Greiner Vacuette Urine CCM tubes. Tube vacuum stability was done in real time. At time point zero, four tubes from each lot were averaged together to ensure that they met (or did not exceed by more than $10 \%$ ) the predetermined fill volume ( $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ , $5 \mathrm { m L }$ or $4 \mathrm { m L }$ ). The rest of the lot was kept at room temperature and periodically tested at one, three, six, nine, 12, 14,and 20 months. At each time point 25 tubes per lot were tested for vacuum fill volume. Tubes were demonstrated to have enough vacuum to autofill within $10 \%$ of the deigned fill volume for each of the three sizes and for all the time points out to 14 months.

Sterilization: The Greiner Vacuette Urine CCM tubes are sold as sterile by e-beam irradiation. Irradiation was set at $1 6 . 6 \mathrm { K G }$ . Bioburden testing was conducted on expired vials. The 14 month sterility claim was supported based on data demonstrating no growth detected up to this period.

d. Detection limit: Not Applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not Applicable

f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Method comparison is not applicable for a bacterial transport medium. The device itself does not provide a result that can be used in making a clinical decision. Bench testing studies were done to determine the ability of the Greiner Vacuette Urine CCM tube to maintain viability of microorganisms commonly found as the etiological agents of urinary tract infections. The microorganisms were spiked into filter sterilized pooled urine for testing. The Greiner Vacuette Urine CCM tube showed recovery of representative bacteria from pooled urine within the acceptance criteria recommended in CLSI-M40-A2. (See section M.1. above ).

b. Matrix comparison: Not Applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not Applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not Applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not Applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not Applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range: Not Applicable

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
