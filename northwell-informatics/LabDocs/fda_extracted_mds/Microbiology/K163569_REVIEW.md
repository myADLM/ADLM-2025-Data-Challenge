# I. Device Description:

The Elecsys CMV IgM is a $\mu$ -capture immunoassay that uses streptavidin microparticles, biotinylated recombinant CMV-specific antigen labeled with a ruthenium complex, and electrochemiluminescence detection. The test system contains human serum-based calibrators intended for use with the system.

The toal duration of the assay is 18 minutes. The assay steps are as follows:

During the first incubation, $6 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of sample are automatically prediluted 1:20 with diluent (Diluent Universal). Biotinylated monoclonal anti-human IgM specific antibodies are also added. During the second incubation, CMV-specific recombinant antigen labeled with a ruthenium complex and streptavidin-coated microparticles are added. Anti-CMV IgM antibodies present in the sample react with the ruthenium-labeled CMV-specific recombinant antigen. The complex becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin with streptavidin.   
· The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then removed with ProCell II M. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier.   
· The analyzer automatically calculates the cutoff based on the measurement of Calibrator 1 and Calibrator 2. The result of the samples is given either as reactive, borderline, or non-reactive as well as in the form of a cutoff index (signal of sample/cutoff)(COI) as shown in Table 1.

# L. Test Principle:

The Elecsys CMV IgM immunoassay is based on the $\mu$ -Capture test format. During the first incubation step, biotinylated monoclonal anti-h-IgM-specific antibodies binds specifically to IgM the diluted test specimen. CMV-specific recombinant antigen labeled with a ruthenium complex and streptavidin-coated microparticles are then added for the second incubation. Anti-CMV IgM antibodies present in the sample react with the ruthenium-labeled CMVspecific recombinant antigen. The complex becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin with streptavidin. The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then removed with ProCell II M. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Reagent Stability: Two studies were conducted to evaluate the stability of the Elecsys CMV IgM assay reagents on the cobas e 801: onboard reagent stability and reagent real-time stability. These studies were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The reagents are stable when stored unopened at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $8 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ for 12 months or onboard (5 to $1 0 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { C }$ ) for 16 weeks.

Sample Stability: Three studies were conducted to evaluate sample stability: sample stability at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { i } }$ , sample stability at $2 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { C } \mathrm { ~ } $ , and sample stability at $- 2 0 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { C }$ . These studies were reviewed and found to be acceptable. Specimens are stable for 4 weeks at $2 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ to $8 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ , 7 days at $2 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { C }$ , or 3 months at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \left( \pm 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \right)$ .

# d. Detection limit:

Limit of Blank: The Limit of Blank (LoB) of the Elecsys CMV IgM assay on the cobas e 801 Immunoassay Analyzer was determined according to CLSI EP17-A2 as the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of measurements of blank samples. Five blank serum samples were assayed with two replicates per run for six runs, using three reagent lots on one instrument, for a total of 60 blank replicates per reagent lot. The LoB was calculated to be 0.243 COI.

Limit of Detection: The Limit of Detection (LoD) of the Elecsys CMV IgM assay on the cobas e 801 Immunoassay Analyzer was determined according to CLSI EP17-A2 as the lowest amount of analyte in a sample that can be detected with $9 5 \%$ probability. Five samples were prepared by spiking human serum samples from single donors with low levels of analyte. The samples were tested with two replicates per sample per run, six runs, with three reagent lots, on one instrument for a total of 60 replicates per sample per reagent lot. The LoD was calculated to be 0.267 COI using the following equation: $_ { \mathrm { L o D = L o B + 1 . 6 5 3 \times S D } }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Endogenous Interferences: To evaluate the effect of elevated levels of biotin (10 to $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } ) }$ , intralipid (150 to $1 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ), hemoglobin (50 to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ), and bilirubin (2 to $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) on the Elecsys CMV IgM assay, four CMV IgM samples (low negative, low positive, positive, and high positive) were tested on the cobas e 801. The recovery $( \% C O I )$ was calculated for each sample and compared to the reference unspiked sample.

Acceptance criteria: Negative/borderline samples $( \mathrm { C O I } { < } 1 . 0 )$ ), deviation $\pm 0 . 2$ COI;   
Positive samples $( \mathrm { C O I } \geq 1 . 0 ) $ ), deviation $\pm 2 0 \%$ (Recovery $80 - 1 2 0 \%$ ).

The results met the acceptance criteria for all concentrations of endogenous interferent tested. Roche will receive the following claims for no interference observed at the following concentrations: biotin $\leq 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ,

intralipid $\leq 1 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , hemoglobin $\leq 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and bilirubin $\leq 2 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

To evaluate the effect of rheumatoid factor (RF), native high RF samples were diluted 1:1 with RF negative-CMV IgM positive and RF negative-CMV negative samples. The results of the CMV positive sample diluted with a RF high sample is compared to a 1:1 dilution of the same CMV sample with RF negative samples with similar total IGM levels as the RF high sample. Seven samples with a CMV IgM COI from 0.203 to 5.77 were diluted 1:1 with 3 RF high/CMV-IgM negative samples. As a reference, the sample samples were diluted with RF negative/CMV-IgM negative samples. RF concentrations of 462 to $8 9 9 \mathrm { \ : I U / m L }$ were tested and met the acceptance criteria. Roche will receive a claim for no interference for $\mathrm { R F } \leq 8 9 9 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

Exogenous Interfering Substances (Drugs): The effect of quantitation of analyte in the presence of drugs was determined by comparing values obtained from native human serum and plasma samples from single donors on the cobas e 801. The samples were spiked with 17 commonly used and 2 special pharmaceutical compounds and tested on the Elecsys 2010 Immunoassay Analyzer. Acetylcysteine and phenylbutazone were measured on the cobas e 411 Immunoassay Analyzer. Two samples negative and positive for CMV IgM were divided into aliquots and spiked with the potential interferent. The concentration of CMV IgM in the samples was approximately $0 . 2 \ : \mathrm { C O I }$ and 1.9 (2.4 for acetylcysteine and phenylbutazone)COI. The CMV IgM concentration of the spiked aliquots was determined in 9-fold determination and compared to the CMV IgM concentration determined for the reference aliquot on the Elecsys 2010 and the cobas e 411 Immunoassay Analyzers, respectively. Acceptance criteria: Negative/borderline samples $( \mathrm { C O I } { < } 1 . 0 )$ ), devation $_ { \pm 0 . 2 \mathrm { C O I } }$ ; Positive samples $( \mathrm { C O I } { > } 1 . 0 )$ ,deviation $\pm 1 0 \%$ . Each compound was found to be non-interfering at the concentration listed in the Table 3.
