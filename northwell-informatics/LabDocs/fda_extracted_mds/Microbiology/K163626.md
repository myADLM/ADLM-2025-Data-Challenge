# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the direct detection and identification of Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) and Bordetella parapertussis (B. parapertussis) nucleic acid in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens obtained from individuals suspected of having a respiratory tract infection attributable to B. pertussis or B. parapertussis.

The $\mathsf { A R l E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay targets the B. pertussis toxin promoter and the B. parapertussis IS1001 insertion element in the genomes. When clinical factors suggest that B. pertussis or B. parapertussis may not be the cause of respiratory infection, other clinically appropriate investigation(s) should be carried out in accordance with published guidelines.

Negative results for the $\mathsf { A R l E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay do not preclude B. pertussis or B. parapertussis infection and positive results do not rule out co-infections with other respiratory pathogens. The direct detection and identification of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis nucleic acids from symptomatic patients aids in the diagnosis of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis respiratory infection in conjunction with other clinical findings and epidemiological information.

The ARIES® Bordetella Assay is indicated for use with the ARIES® Systems.

2. Indication(s) for use: Same as intended use.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only.

4. Special instrument requirements: For use with the ARIES® Systems.

# I. Device Description:

The $\mathsf { A R l E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based qualitative in vitro diagnostic test system that consists of the $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ System or the $\mathsf { A R l E S } ^ { \otimes }$ M1 System with their included $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Software, an assay-specific cassette, and an assay-specific protocol file. The $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay cassette is a disposable, single-use cassette containing nucleic acid purification reagents, internal sample process control (SPC), and an assay-specific master mix capable of performing the designated assay on one sample. The $\mathsf { A R l E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay cassette directly detects and identifies B. pertussis and B. parapertussis DNA from nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens collected from the human nasopharynx region.

Nasopharyngeal swab specimens are collected from patients using a commercially available ESwab™ (Nylon® Flocked Swab along with modified Liquid Amies) or a commercially available nasopharyngeal swab (i.e. rayon, flocked, nylon, plastic shaft, etc.) placed into an approved transport media (i.e UTM, M5, M6, or equivalent). The specimen is then transported to the laboratory for testing. The specimen is lysed and nucleic acid is extracted using an ARIES®

System. An extractable sample processing control (SPC) target is present in the $\mathsf { A R l E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay cassette and is processed with the specimen. The SPC controls for specimen lysis, for recovery of extracted nucleic acid, for inhibitory substances and for PCR reagent and instrument integrity. The Ct value of the SPC is designed to verify proper specimen lysis and nucleic acid extraction, to identify PCR inhibition, if any, and verify proper function of the extraction system and real-time instrument. The ${ \sf T } _ { \sf m }$ value of the SPC is used as a reference for determining the target ${ \sf T } _ { \sf m }$ .

The extracted nucleic acid and SPC are transferred via magnetic beads through the cassette to the $\mathsf { A R l E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay lyophilized PCR reagents in the PCR tube that contains primer pairs specific to the B. pertussis toxin promoter (ptxA-pr), the B. parapertussis IS1001 insertion element, and the SPC sequence. Each of the primer pairs are labeled with a distinct fluorophore and detected in distinct channels of the AR $\mathsf { E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Systems. PCR amplification is performed and assay fluorescence is monitored. Incorporation of a quencher-labeled nucleotide results in a decrease in fluorescence for the associated primer pair. Following amplification, the reaction is slowly heated to separate the fluorescent-labeled strand from the quencher-labeled strand, a process that results in an increase in the fluorescence signal. The reaction fluorescence is measured during this process and the temperature at which the change in fluorescence is the maximum ${ \sf T } _ { \sf m }$ of the amplicon. The strands of the amplicons will separate at a specific melting temperature $( \mathsf { T } _ { \mathsf { m } } )$ and an increase in fluorescence is observed. The instrument fluorescence output is analyzed and test results are determined using the ARI $\mathsf { E S } ^ { \otimes }$ System software and the $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay protocol and run files. $\mathsf { A R l E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay results may be reported from the ARI $\mathsf { E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Software or from the optional SYNCT® Software.

# K. Standards/Guidance Documents Referenced:

Not applicable.

# L. Test Principle:

The $\mathsf { A R l E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay chemistry is based on an expanded genetic alphabet technology, consisting of synthetic DNA base pair $2 "$ -deoxy-5-methyl-isocytidine (iC): 2'-deoxyisoguanosine (iG). The isobases (iC and iG) pair specifically with each other and not with natural nucleotides. In addition, isobases are efficiently incorporated during PCR. During PCR amplification, a quenchermodified iGTP is incorporated by the polymerase opposite an iC and a fluorophore reporter attached to a PCR primer. If the target is present and is amplified, assay fluorescence decreases with every cycle as amplification product accumulates. The decrease in assay fluorescence is monitored in real time using the $\mathsf { A R l E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Systems. Following PCR, the amplification products are thermally denatured and assay fluorescence is monitored. The strands of the amplification products are separated and assay fluorescence increases, thus enabling determination of the melting temperature $( \mathsf { T } _ { \mathsf { m } } )$ of the amplicon.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance:

a. Reproducibility/Precision/Repeatability:

Reproducibility of the $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay was evaluated by testing one lot of ARIES® Bordetella Assay Cassettes on two $\mathsf { A R l E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Systems by two operators at each of three sites, 2 external clinical and 1 internal, on five non-consecutive days. A blinded and randomized reproducibility panel was prepared and sent to these sites by an independent operator that consisted of B. pertussis low positive, B. pertussis moderate positive, B. parapertussis low positive, B. parapertussis moderate positive and B. pertussis and B. parapertussis negative sample diluted into the negative natural nasopharyngeal matrix. Each panel member was tested in triplicate by each operator each day of testing. The results of the reproducibility study are shown in Tables 11.3 and 11.4. The results showed that the reproducibility of the $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay across the three sites met the acceptance criteria of $100 \%$ positive for moderate positive samples, $\geq 9 5 \%$ positive for low positive samples, and $100 \%$ negative for negative samples.

Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility of the $\mathsf { A R l E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay was evaluated by one operator using one $\mathsf { A R l E S } ^ { \otimes }$ instrument to test three lots of the $\mathsf { A R l E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay Cassettes. A reproducibility panel consisting of B. pertussis low positive, B. pertussis moderate positive, B. parapertussis low positive, B. parapertussis moderate positive, and B. pertussis and B. parapertussis negative sample diluted into the negative natural nasopharyngeal matrix were prepared and tested to evaluate the lot-to-lot reproducibility. Three replicates of each sample concentration were run five times (for a total of fifteen replicates) for each lot of the $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay Cassette. The identity of these samples was blinded to the operator. The results of the study are shown in Table 11.5. The test results showed that the reproducibility across the three $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay Cassette lots met the acceptance criteria of $100 \%$ positive for moderate positive samples, $\geq 9 5 \%$ positive for low positive samples, and $100 \%$ negative for negative samples.

Within-laboratory precision/repeatability for the $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay was evaluated by testing B. pertussis and B. parapertussis samples at various concentration levels across multiple days utilizing multiple operators, multiple $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Systems and one lot of the $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay Cassette. Study samples were prepared that consisted of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis culture diluted into negative natural nasopharyngeal matrix at five concentration levels – moderate positive B. pertussis, low positive B. pertussis, moderate positive B. parapertussis, low positive B. parapertussis, and a B. pertussis and B. parapertussis negative sample. These samples were blinded to the operator and tested in triplicate by two operators across five non-consecutive days. The results of the study shown in Table 11.6 demonstrate that results obtained with the $\mathsf { A R l E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay between multiple operators using multiple instruments within a laboratory run across multiple days are repeatable across a range of Bordetella concentration levels.

Stability:

Specimen Stability (Fresh vs. Frozen)

The performance equivalency of the $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay was assessed using contrived Bordetella specimens when tested from the fresh state (i.e. unfrozen) and specimens that were tested after being stored at -65 to $- 9 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ (frozen). Equivalency was evaluated using samples consisting of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis culture diluted independently into natural negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix at three test concentrations. A total of 120 samples were tested for each Bordetella strain of which half were tested immediately upon preparation (fresh) and the remaining samples were frozen at -65 to $\mathsf { - 9 5 ^ { \circ } C }$ and tested 24 to 48 hours later. Six replicates of natural negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix were also tested fresh and frozen as a negative control. Of each set of fresh and frozen samples, $50 \%$ were targeted to 3x LoD, $2 5 \%$ were targeted to 10X LoD and the remaining $2 5 \%$ of the samples were targeted to 100X LoD.

The results of the study are shown in Table 11.7. Based on this study, no significant difference in the performance of AR $\mathsf { E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay was observed between specimens tested fresh and specimens that were tested after being stored frozen at -65 to $- 9 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ .

# Shelf-Life Stability

A real time stability study was performed to evaluate the shelf life of $\mathsf { A R l E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay Cassettes. Stability was assessed by testing three replicates of Bordetella Extractable Control, ${ 1 0 0 \times }$ LoD Blend and three replicates of negative targets (Copan UTM) on three different lots of ARIES® Bordetella cassettes stored at two different temperatures $( 4 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } ( 2 - 8 $ $^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } } )$ and room temperature $\left( 1 5 - 3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \right)$ ). The study was designed following guidelines listed in EP25-A, Evaluation of Stability of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents; Approved Guideline and BS EN ISO 23640: 2013 - In vitro diagnostic medical devices – Evaluation of stability of in vitro diagnostic reagents. Acceptance criteria for stability at each time point and temperature were established as $100 \%$ positivity for all Bordetella replicates and $100 \%$ negativity for all negative replicates. Data for AR $\mathsf { E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay Cassette stability has been collected up to 7 months and gave expected results indicating stability up to 7 months. Stability studies are on-going.

# Controls:

Process Control

Each $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay cassette contains a Sample Process Control (SPC), which is processed with the sample and analyzed during the amplification reaction. The SPC verifies sample lysis, nucleic acid extraction, and proper reagent, cassette, $\mathsf { A R l E S } ^ { \otimes }$ System, and assay protocol performance. The SPC has a known melting temperature $( \mathsf { T } _ { \mathsf { m } } )$ range and Ct range. Each time an assay is run, the system measures the temperature and fluorescence intensity of the SPC control to ensure the thermal and optical subsystems have remained in calibration.

# External Controls

External controls should be tested according to guidelines or requirements of local, provincial and/or federal regulations or accreditation organizations. Reference Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis strains or well characterized Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis clinical isolates may be used as positive controls. The ARIES® Bordetella Assay Cassette Kit does not include external positive and negative controls.

# d. Detection Limit:

A Limit of Detection (LoD) study was performed to evaluate the analytical sensitivity of the $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay using two strains each of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis diluted in natural negative nasopharyngeal (NP) swab matrix. Preliminary LoD concentrations were determined using serial dilutions of each Bordetella strain in natural negative nasopharyngeal (NP) swab matrix where each dilution was quantified using standard dilution and quantitative culture techniques. These preliminary LoD concentrations were confirmed by testing twenty (20) replicates of each strain. All Bordetella strain concentrations were verified by plating and colony counting $( \mathsf { C F U / m L } )$ . The LoD for each Bordetella strain was determined as the lowest concentration that had a positivity rate of $\geq$ $9 5 \%$ . The final LoD concentrations for the four strains of Bordetella are shown in Table 11.8. The overall assay LoD for B. pertussis is $1 , 8 0 0 \mathsf { C F U / m L }$ and B. parapertussis is $2 1 3 \thinspace { \mathsf { C F U / m L } }$ .

# e. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)

The analytical reactivity (inclusivity) of the $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay was evaluated against eighteen (18) Bordetella strains; eleven B. pertussis and seven B. parapertussis strains. These strains differed from those that were tested as part of the Limit of Detection study. The specimens were prepared by diluting quantified cultured organism into pooled natural negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix at a concentration of three times the confirmed limit of detection of the $\mathsf { A R l E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay and tested in triplicate. All seven strains of B. parapertussis were detected with $100 \%$ positivity at 3x LoD. Additionally, nine of the eleven strains of B. pertussis were detected with $100 \%$ positivity at 3x LoD while two strains, ATCC 8478 and ATCC 9797, were not detected at either $3 { \tt x } _ { \mathrm { - } }$ , 10x or ${ 1 0 0 \times }$ LoD. Sequencing of these two strains showed that both strains contained a similar nucleotide mismatch in both $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ B. pertussis primer binding regions, forward and reverse, which may impact the ability of the ARIES® Bordetella assay to detect these strains. An in-silico search of Bordetella pertussis sequences in the NCBI database identified a low prevalence of strains with similar mismatches $( 2 . 9 \% )$ . Furthermore, all of these strains have decades old collection dates for strains with known human hosts—suggesting that these strains are no longer prevalent in the human population. Thus, there is a low risk of the $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay missing a circulating strain of B. pertussis. The results of the inclusivity testing are shown in Table 11.9.

# f. Analytical specificity:

# Interfering Substances:

The potential inhibitory effect of non-microbial substances expected to be found in human nasopharyngeal swab specimens was evaluated for the ARIES® Bordetella Assay. Three replicates each of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis were tested at concentrations near the assay LoD with a relative, high concentration of each non-microbial substance spiked into the contrived sample. Additionally, negative natural human nasopharyngeal swab matrix was spiked with the same concentration of each non-microbial substance and tested for assay interference. Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis samples were contrived by independently diluting cultures into natural negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix at a concentration of three times the limit of detection of the ARIES® Bordetella Assay for the strain tested.

The results of the study are shown in Table 11.10. Based on this study, none of the substances tested showed any interference with the ARIES® Bordetella Assay.

# Cross-Reactivity (Exclusivity):

Cross reactivity for the $\mathsf { A R l E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay was assessed with 65 unique microorganisms that are common to the same human matrix as B. pertussis and or B. parapertussis infections, that cause infections that might present similar symptoms to $B$ . pertussis and or B. parapertussis infections, and that could potentially interfere with the diagnostic capabilities of the $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay. Bacteria were tested at $\ge 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathsf { C F U / m L }$ or the highest available concentration, and viruses were tested at $\geq 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathsf { T C l D 5 0 } / \mathsf { m L }$ or the highest available concentration. These potential cross reactive organisms were spiked at high concentration into natural negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix and tested in triplicate $\scriptstyle ( n = 3 )$ on the $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ System. In addition to the 65 unique microorganisms, multiple strains of Bordetella bronchiseptica and Bordetella holmesii were also tested for crossreactivity for a total of 71 microorganisms. Of the 71 microorganisms tested, 66 yielded negative results for B. pertussis and B. parapertussis and thus are considered non-reactive with the ARIES® Bordetella Assay. Five organisms, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Human Coronavirus OC43, Influenza B, Moraxella catarrhalis and Proteus vulgaris generated a false positive result in 1 out of 6 replicates. All microorganisms evaluated are listed in Table 11.11.

Microbial Interference (Cross Reactivity)/Co-Infection:

Microbial interference for the $\mathsf { A R l E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay was assessed with 65 unique cross reactive microorganisms (CRO) that are commonly found in the same human matrix as B. pertussis and or B. parapertussis infections, that cause infections that might present similar symptoms to B. pertussis and or B. parapertussis infections, and could potentially interfere with the diagnostic capabilities of the $\mathsf { A R l E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay. Bacteria were tested at ${ \geq } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ $C F U / \mathsf { m L }$ or the highest available concentration, and viruses were tested at $\geq 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathsf { T C l D 5 0 } / \mathsf { m L }$ or the highest available concentration. The potential interfering organisms were spiked into natural negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix containing representative strains of Bordetella pertussis (BP) or Bordetella parapertussis (BPP) near the LoD concentration. All target strain $+ \mathsf { C R O }$ samples were tested in triplicate $\scriptstyle ( n = 3 )$ on the $\mathsf { A R l E S } ^ { \otimes }$ System. In addition to the 65 unique microorganisms, multiple strains of Bordetella bronchiseptica and Bordetella holmesii were also tested for microbial interference. B. pertussis was correctly detected in $3 / 3$ replicates when tested in the presence of 66 CROs, with 5 CROs, Bordetella bronchiseptica (strain 1 and strain 2), Bordetella petrii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae requiring additional testing of 3 replicates per protocol. For these 5 CROs, B.

pertussis was detected in 5/6 replicates. B. parapertussis was correctly detected in 3/3 replicates when tested in the presence of all 71 CROs.

Microbial interference was also evaluated in a co-infection setting where near LoD concentration B. pertussis was tested with high concentration of B. parapertussis and viceversa. A low/low and a high/high combination of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis were also evaluated. All replicates in all combinations yielded expected positivity for B. pertussis and B. parapertussis. All microorganisms evaluated are listed in Table 11.11.

# Carry-Over/Cross-Contamination:

Carry-over and cross contamination for the $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay was evaluated by using samples consisting of Bordetella pertussis culture diluted into pooled natural negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix at a concentration of $1 { \times } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \thinspace { \mathsf { C F U / m L } }$ . Testing was performed using thirty high positive Bordetella pertussis samples in series alternating with thirty Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis negative (pooled natural negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix) samples. The high positive samples were run adjacent to negative samples across five consecutive runs using one ARIES® System.

The result of the study was no carry-over or cross contamination observed.

# g. Assay cut-off:

Each target in the ARIES® Bordetella assay (B. pertussis and B. parapertussis) has a Ct cut-off, Tm window, and Tm Peak Threshold. In addition, the internal sample process control (SPC) also has a corresponding Ct cut-off, Tm window, and Tm Peak Threshold. Collectively, the cut-off values compose the assay protocol file parameters, which are used to determine the assay result for the detection target as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or INVALID.

The Assay Protocol File parameters were determined, and their performance in the ARIES® Bordetella Assay were evaluated according to the following general procedure:

Initial Assay Protocol File parameters were set during internal optimization studies The final Assay Protocol File parameters were then established during internal verification studies The selected Assay Protocol File parameter values were utilized in the determination of assay performance in the multi-site clinical trial conducted for the $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay

2. Comparison Studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable.

b. Collection Media Comparison:

The compatibility of four media, UTM™, M5® , M6™ and ESwab™, was evaluated with the ARIES® Bordetella Assay using two strains each of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis. Each strain of Bordetella was independently diluted in the media at a concentration of three times the limit of detection of the $\mathsf { A R l E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay for that strain. The study was performed in multiple assay runs with twenty replicates for each media type and each strain of Bordetella and three replicates for each media type by itself as the negative control.

The results of the study are shown in Table 11.12. Based on this study, the four different types of media when tested with the two different types of Bordetella strains were determined to be compatible with the ARIES® Bordetella Assay.

# c. Swab Comparison:

The compatibility of 3 different types of nasopharyngeal swabs, Flocked, Rayon and Polyester was evaluated with the $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay using one strain each of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis. The Bordetella strains were diluted independently into pooled natural negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix and applied to each swab type. The collection swabs were then inserted and broken off inside 3mL Universal Transport Medium (UTM) vials for a final concentration of 3x LoD in the transport medium. In addition, a negative sample consisting of the swab only transferred in UTM was also evaluated.

The results of the study are shown in Table 11.13. Based on this study, the three different types of nasopharyngeal swabs when tested with the Bordetella strains were determined to be compatible with the ARIES® Bordetella Assay.

# 3. Clinical Performance:

The clinical performance of $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay was evaluated using leftover deidentified nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens prospectively collected from pediatric and adult patients suspected of having respiratory tract infection attributable to B. pertussis or B. parapertussis.

Five (5) geographically distinct clinical sites within the United States prospectively collected specimens from July through November 2016. The clinical performance of the ARIES® Bordetella Assay was evaluated on these prospectively collected specimens at four (4) of the five (5) clinical sites using the ARIES® System. One (1) clinical site collected specimens then shipped them frozen on dry ice to one of the other clinical sites for ARIES® Bordetella Assay testing. Specimens included in the clinical study consisted of leftover de-identified nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) specimens prospectively collected from pediatric and adult patients suspected of having respiratory tract infection attributable to B. pertussis or B. parapertussis.

A total of 1052 unique specimens that met the pre-determined inclusion criteria were included in the study and tested for B. pertussis or B. parapertussis by both the reference method and the ARIES® Bordetella Assay. The performance of ARIES® Bordetella Assay for B. pertussis and B. parapertussis was compared to a composite comparator assay consisting of two well-characterized real-time PCR assays (for each bacterial pathogen) followed by confirmation of positive PCR amplification product with bi-directional sequencing. Comparator PCR assays for B. pertussis and B. parapertussis targeted unique sequences within the promoter region of the ptxA gene and IS1001 insertion region (respectively) that were different than those targeted by the ARIES® Bordetella Assay. Specimens were characterized as positive for B. pertussis or B. parapertussis if one out of two comparator PCR assays was positive (Ct values $\leq 4 0$ ) and confirmed by bi-directional sequencing, or if both comparator PCR assays were positive. Specimens were characterized as B. pertussis or B. parapertussis negative if one out of two comparator PCR assays was negative (Ct values ${ > } 4 0 _ { i }$ ) and confirmed by bi-directional sequencing, or if both comparator PCR assays were negative.

Comparator real-time PCR and bi-directional sequencing assays were performed at a centralized testing facility. Clinical runs and re-runs using ARIES® Bordetella Assay were carried out by trained operators at the four (4) testing sites on specimens that were either kept refrigerated at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ to ${ } ^ { 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } }$ for up to 72 hours prior to testing $\left( \mathsf { N { = } } 6 6 7 ; 6 3 . 4 \% \right)$ or stored frozen at $\frown$ to $\mathsf { - 9 5 ^ { \circ } C }$ for up to 12 days prior to testing $( N { = } 3 8 5 ; 3 6 . 6 \% )$ .

Out of the 1052 clinical specimens included in the prospective study analysis, 1043 $( 9 9 . 1 \% )$ generated valid ARIES® Bordetella Assay results (i.e., positive or negative) on the first attempt. There were 9 specimens $( 9 / 1 0 5 2 ; 0 . 9 \% )$ that were re-tested with ARIES® Bordetella Assay because they yielded invalid results in the initial run $( N = 3 )$ or because of instrument error $( N = 6 )$ . All nine (9) specimens generated valid ARIES® results upon repeat testing.

In the prospective study, the ARIES® Bordetella Assay Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) for B. pertussis was reported to be $9 3 . 8 \%$ (30/32) with a lower bound of the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $7 9 . 2 \%$ . Positive Percent Agreement of the ARIES® Bordetella Assay for $B .$ . parapertussis was reported to be $100 \%$ (2/2) with a lower bound of the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $1 5 . 8 \%$ . Negative Percent Agreement of the ARIES® Bordetella Assay for B. pertussis and B. parapertussis were respectively; $9 8 . 9 \%$ (1009/1020) with a lower bound $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $9 8 . 1 \%$ , and $9 9 . 8 \%$ (1048/1050) with a lower bound $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $9 9 . 3 \%$ .

Due to the low prevalence B. pertussis and B. parapertussis observed in the prospective study, the clinical sample set was supplemented with banked (pre-selected) B. pertussis $( N = 3 7 )$ and B. parapertussis $( N = 2 0 )$ ) positive specimens as well as contrived B. parapertussis specimens $( N = 5 0 )$ . Pre-selected B. pertussis specimens were collected at six (6) clinical sites in the United States while pre-selected B. parapertussis specimens were collected at three (3) sites also located in the United States. Contrived B. parapertussis samples were prepared by spiking well-characterized bacterial strains into individual negative clinical samples (NP swabs) at clinically relevant titers. B. parapertussis contrived specimens were prepared at analyte concentrations near the ARIES® Bordetella Assay limit of detection (LoD) as well as concentrations spanning the clinically moderate to high positive ranges. The presence of the expected bacterial target in each of the pre-selected and contrived specimens was confirmed by comparator real-time PCR and bi-directional sequencing assays. In addition, bacterial organism concentrations in contrived specimens were verified by culture methods (plating and colony count). In order to minimize bias, pre-selected and contrived specimens were tested along with an equal number of unique negative clinical specimens in a randomized, blinded fashion at three (3) external testing sites. ARIES® Bordetella Assay accurately detected all 37 B. pertussis ( $100 \%$ PPA; $9 5 \%$ confidence interval: $9 0 . 5 \% - \ 1 0 0 \% )$ and all ${ 2 0 \ 8 } .$ . parapertussis positive specimens tested ( $100 \%$ PPA; $9 5 \%$ confidence interval: $8 3 . 2 \% - \ 1 0 0 \% )$ . One of the pre-selected specimens generated a false positive result for B. parapertussis by $\mathsf { A R I E S } ^ { \otimes }$ Bordetella Assay when compared to the composite comparator method (01-122). All fifty (50) contrived B. parapertussis samples were accurately detected by the ARIES® Bordetella assay $100 \%$ PPA; $9 5 \%$ confidence interval $9 2 . 9 \% - \ 1 0 0 \% )$ ). All but one of the pre-selected and contrived specimens generated valid ARIES® result upon initial testing. The invalid result was resolved upon re-test.

The performance of the ARIES® Bordetella Assay for B. pertussis and B. parapertussis as compared to the composite reference method is summarized in the Table 11.14 and Table 11.15 for prospective, pre-selected and contrived specimens. The overall performance of the ARIES® Bordetella Assay in combined prospective, pre-selected and contrived specimens is also presented.
