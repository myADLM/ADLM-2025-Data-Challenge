# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The ARIES Bordetella Assay is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the direct detection and identification of Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) and Bordetella parapertussis ( $B$ . parapertussis) nucleic acid in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens obtained from individuals suspected of having a respiratory tract infection attributable to $B$ . pertussis or $B$ . parapertussis. The ARIES Bordetella Assay targets the $B _ { \cdot }$ . pertussis toxin promoter and the $B .$ . parapertussis IS1001 insertion element in the genomes. When clinical factors suggest that $B .$ . pertussis or B. parapertussis may not be the cause of respiratory infection, other clinically appropriate investigation(s) should be carried out in accordance with published guidelines.

Negative results for the ARIES Bordetella Assay do not preclude $B$ . pertussis or $B$ . parapertussis infection and positive results do not rule out co-infections with other respiratory pathogens. The direct detection and identification of $B$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis nucleic acids from symptomatic patients aids in the diagnosis of $B$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis respiratory infection in conjunction with other clinical findings and epidemiological information.

The ARIES Bordetella Assay is indicated for use with the ARIES Systems.

# I. Device Description:

The ARIES Bordetella Assay is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based qualitative in vitro diagnostic test system that consists of the ARIES System or the ARIES M1 System with their included ARIES Software, an assay-specific cassette, and an assayspecific protocol file. The ARIES Bordetella Assay cassette is a disposable, single-use cassette containing nucleic acid purification reagents, internal sample process control (SPC), and an assay-specific master mix capable of performing the designated assay on one sample. The ARIES Bordetella Assay cassette directly detects and identifies $B$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis DNA from nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens collected from the human nasopharynx region.

Nasopharyngeal swab specimens are collected from patients using a commercially available nasopharyngeal swab placed into transport media (i.e. Universal Transport Media (UTM), ESwab, M5, M6). The specimen is then transported to the laboratory for testing. The specimen is lysed and nucleic acid is extracted using the ARIES system. The ARIES system subsequently performs PCR amplification of target sequences, and assay fluorescence is monitored via distinct fluorophore labels on primer pairs. As the reaction is slowly heated the fluorescent-quencher labeled strands separate, and a maximum fluorescence is observed. The instrument fluorescence output is analyzed, and test results are determined using the ARIES System software and the ARIES Bordetella Assay protocol and run files.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

# L. Test Principle:

The ARIES Bordetella Assay chemistry is based on an expanded genetic alphabet technology, consisting of synthetic DNA base pair—2'-deoxy-5-methyl-isocytidine (iC):2'- deoxyisoguanosine (iG). The isobases (iC and iG) pair specifically with each other and not with natural nucleotides. In addition, isobases are efficiently incorporated during PCR. During PCR amplification, a quencher-modified iGTP is incorporated by the polymerase opposite an iC and a fluorophore reporter attached to a PCR primer. If the target is present and is amplified, assay fluorescence decreases with every cycle as amplification product accumulates. The decrease in assay fluorescence is monitored in real time using the ARIES Systems. Following PCR, the amplification products are thermally denatured and assay fluorescence is monitored. The strands of the amplification products are separated and assay fluorescence increases, thus enabling determination of the melting temperature (Tm) of the amplicon.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

For all precision and reproducibility studies where the concentration of the Bordetella targets are varied, low positive (LP) is $1 . 5 \mathrm { x }$ LoD, and moderate positive (MP) is 5x LoD.

Inter-site reproducibility of the ARIES Bordetella Assay was evaluated by testing one lot of ARIES Bordetella Assay Cassettes on two ARIES Systems at each of three sites—2 external clinical and 1 internal. The results are shown in Table 1. A blinded and randomized reproducibility panel was prepared and sent to the sites that consisted of B. pertussis low positive, B. pertussis moderate positive, $B$ . parapertussis low positive, $B _ { \cdot }$ . parapertussis moderate positive, and $B$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis

negative sample diluted into the negative natural nasopharyngeal matrix. Three replicates of each panel member was tested once for 5 non-consecutive days by two operators at each site.

One replicate of Low Positive $\left( 1 . 5 \mathrm { x } \mathrm { L o D } \right) B .$ . pertussis correctly identified $B$ . pertussis as expected, but also yielded a false positive $B _ { \cdot }$ . parapertussis with late Ct ${ \sim } 3 9$ cycles). Note that the expected results for a Moderate Positive target was $100 \%$ Positive, a Low Positive was $2 9 5 \%$ Positive, and Negative was $0 \%$ Positive.

a An invalid rate of $1 . 3 \%$ (6/456) was observed for Site to Site Reproducibility study. b The expected result for Moderate Positive target was $100 \%$ Positive, Low Positive was $2 9 5 \%$ Positive, and Negative was $0 \%$ Positive. c One Low Positive was correctly identified as $B _ { \cdot }$ . pertussis but also yielded a False Positive for $B$ . parapertussis.

Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility of the ARIES Bordetella Assay was evaluated by one operator using one ARIES instrument to test 3 lots of the assay cassettes. A reproducibility panel consisting of $B$ . pertussis low positive, $B .$ . pertussis moderate positive, $B .$ . parapertussis low positive, $B .$ . parapertussis moderate positive, and $B$ . pertussis and B. parapertussis negative sample diluted into the negative natural nasopharyngeal matrix were prepared and tested to evaluate the lot-to-lot reproducibility. Three replicates of each sample concentration were run five times (15 total replicates) for each lot of the ARIES Bordetella cassette. The identity of these samples was blinded to the operator. The test results shown in Table 2 indicated that the reproducibility demonstrated across the 3 Bordetella cassette lots was according to what was expected for moderate positive samples ( $100 \%$ positive), low positive samples $( \geq 9 5 \%$ positive), and negative samples ( $100 \%$ negative).

a An invalid rate of $0 . 9 \%$ (2/227) was observed for Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility study. One invalid was shared with the site-to-site reproducibility study. b The expected result for Moderate Positive target was $100 \%$ Positive, Low Positive was $2 9 5 \%$ Positive, and Negative was $0 \%$ Positive.

Within-laboratory precision/repeatability of the ARIES Bordetella Assay was evaluated by testing $B$ . pertussis and $B _ { \cdot }$ . parapertussis samples at various concentration levels across multiple days utilizing multiple operators, ARIES systems, and one lot of the ARIES Bordetella Assay cassette. . Samples were blinded to the operator and tested in triplicate by two operators across 5 non-consecutive days.

# Stability:

Fresh Specimen Stability: Fresh specimen stability was determined using samples of $B$ . pertussis and $B _ { \cdot }$ . parapertussis independently diluted into pooled natural negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix at 3x LoD. These samples were aliquoted and stored at both ambient $( 1 8 \small { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and refrigerated $\left( 2 \mathrm { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \right)$ temperatures and tested in triplicate at multiple time points using the ARIES Bordetella Assay (total of 15 samples for each storage condition type). The samples stored at ambient temperature (18 to $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) were evaluated for stability up to 8 hours, with testing at multiple intervals between 0 and 8 hours plus an additional time point past 8 hours. The samples stored refrigerated (2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) were evaluated for stability up to 7 days, with testing at multiple intervals between 0 and 7 days plus an additional time point past 7 days.

The results of testing are shown in Table 4, and indicated that fresh clinical specimens for the ARIES Bordetella Assay are stable for up to 8 hours when stored at $1 8 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and up to 7 days when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Note that there was one Low Positive $B _ { \cdot }$ . pertussis sample (8 hour time point) that yielded an invalid result for the ambient storage condition, and was not repeated.

An overall invalid rate of $2 . 1 \%$ was observed a One invalid replicate was not repeated b Agreement results represent data up to 10 days c Agreement results represent data up to 10 hours d One replicate yielded a $B .$ . pertussis positive. Upon repeating, all three replicates yielded $100 \%$ negative for both $B$ . pertussis and $B .$ . parapertussis.

Fresh vs. Frozen Study: The performance of frozen samples when tested on the ARIES Bordetella Assay was assessed using contrived Bordetella specimens stored at -65 to ${ } _ { - 9 5 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (frozen). Peformance was established using samples consisting of $B$ . pertussis and $B _ { \cdot }$ . parapertussis culture diluted independently into natural negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix at three test concentrations. A total of 120 samples were tested for each Bordetella strain;half were tested immediately upon preparation (fresh) and the remaining samples were frozen and tested 24-48 hours later. Six replicates of nautral negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix were also tested fresh and frozen as a negative control. For each set of fresh and frozen samples, the proportions of samples per concentration were $50 \%$ (3x LoD), $2 5 \%$ (10x LoD), and $2 5 \%$ ( $1 0 0 \mathrm { x }$ LoD). No significant difference in performance of ARIES Bordetella Assay was observed between fresh or frozen samples.

Frozen Specimen Stability: Frozen specimen stability was determined using contrived samples of $B$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis independently diluted into pooled natural negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix at 3x LoD for the strain, and a negative sample. Stability testing of the frozen specimens was conducted for up to 6 months. Samples were aliquoted and stored at -65 to $- 9 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { i } }$ , tested in triplicate at multiple time points using the ARIES Bordetella Assay. Study results indicated that clinical specimens for the ARIES Bordetella Assay are stable for up to 5 months when stored at -65 to ${ } _ { - 9 5 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Shelf-life Stability:

Reagent stability was assessed by testing 3 replicates of Bordetella Extractable Control, $1 0 0 \mathrm { x }$ LoD Blend and 3 replicates of negative targets (Copan UTM) on three different lots of ARIES Bordetella cassettes stored at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and room temperature $( 1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . The study was according to guidelines in EP25-A, Evaluation of Stability of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents; Approved Guideline and BS EN ISO 23640: 2013-In vitro diagnostic medical devices–Evaluation of stability of in vitro diagnostic reagents. Acceptance criteria was set to $100 \%$ positivity for all Bordetella replicates and $100 \%$ negativity for all negative replicates. Data was collected for 7 months and indicated stability up to 7 months.

# Controls:

Each ARIES Bordetella Assay cassette contains a Sample Process Control (SPC), which is processed with the sample and analyzed during each run. The SPC verifies sample lysis, nucleic acid extraction, and proper performance of the ARIES System’s assay protocol and test components. The SPC has known Tm and Ct values. With each assay run, the system measures the SPC temperature and fluorescence intensity to ensure the thermal and optical subsystems are within the specifications.

The ARIES Bordetella Assay Cassette Kit does not include external positive and negative controls. External controls should be tested according to guidelines or requirements of local, provincial, federal, and/or accreditation organizations. Reference strains or well characterized clinical isolates of $B$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis may be used as positive controls.

# d. Detection limit:

A Limit of Detection (LoD) study was performed to establish the analytical sensitivity of the ARIES Bordetella Assay. Serially diluted suspensions from quantified cultures of $B$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis each in natural negative nasopharyngeal (NP) swab matrix were used to determine preliminary LoD concentrations. These preliminary LoD concentrations were confirmed by testing twenty (20) replicates of each strain. All Bordetella strain concentrations were verified by plating and colony counts (CFU/mL). The LoD for each Bordetella strain was determined as the lowest concentration that generated a positivity rate $3 \% \geq 9 5 \%$ . The analytical LoD was confirmed using the final assay protocol file parameters (i.e. cut-off values). The final LoD concentrations for the four strains of Bordetella are shown in Table 5 below. The overall assay LoD for $B$ . pertussis is $1 8 0 0 \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ and B. parapertussis is $2 1 3 \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ .

An overall invalid rate of $1 . 5 \%$ was observed. aConfirmed LoD is one dilution higher than the preliminary LoD concentration. bConfirmed LoD is two dilutions higher than the preliminary LoD concentration.

# e. Inclusivity:

The ability of the ARIES Bordetella Assay to detect multiple strains of $B$ . pertussis and B. parapertussis was evaluated in analytical reactivity (inclusivity) studies. Eighteen (18) Bordetella strains; eleven (11) $B$ . pertussis and seven $( 7 ) B$ . parapertussis strains which were not tested in the LoD studies were used to establish inclusivity. . The specimens were prepared by diluting cultured organism into pooled natural negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix at a concentration of $3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD, and tested in triplicate.

In summary, all seven strains of $B$ . parapertussis were detected with $100 \%$ positivity (3x LoD). Nine of the eleven $B _ { \cdot }$ . pertussis strains were detected with $100 \%$ positivity ( $3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD). Two of the eleven $B$ . pertussis strains (ATCC 8478 and ATCC 9797), were not detected at either 3x, 10x, or $1 0 0 \mathrm { x }$ LoD. Sequencing of these two strains revealed a similar nucleotide mismatch in both ARIES $B$ . pertussis forward and reverse primer binding regions, and is believed to have impacted the reactivity of the assay. An in silico search of $B$ . pertussis sequences in the NCBI database indicated a low number $( 2 . 9 \% )$ of strains with similar mismatches.

ND— Two strains of B. pertussis, ATCC 8478 and ATCC 9797 were not detected (ND) using the ARIES Bordetella assay.

# f. Analytical specificity:

# INTERFERRING SUBSTANCES

The inhibition potential of non-microbial substances, that are expected to be in human nasopharyngeal swab specimens, was evaluated for the ARIES Bordetella Assay. Three replicates each of $B$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis were tested at concentrations near the assay LoD with a relatively high concentration of each nonmicrobial substance spiked into the contrived sample. Additionally, negative natural human nasopharyngeal swab matrix was spiked with the same concentration of each non-microbial substance and tested for assay interference.

B. pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis samples were contrived by independently diluting cultures into natural negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix at a concentration of $3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD for the strain tested.

Table 8 lists the interferrent substances that were tested, along with the corresponding test concentration, to demonstrate there was no interference with the ARIES Bordetella Assay.

# CROSS-REACTIVITY (EXCLUSIVITY)

Cross-reactivity for the ARIES Bordetella Assay was evaluated with 65 unique microorganisms that were:

Common to the same human matrix as $B$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis infections

· Cause infections that might present similar symptoms to $B$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis infections   
· Were previously determined to potentially interfere with the diagnostic performance of the ARIES Bordetella Assay

Bacteria were tested at $\geq 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ or the highest available concentration, and viruses were tested at $\ge 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ or the highest available concentration. These potential cross reactive organisms were spiked at high concentration into natural negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix and tested in triplicate on the ARIES System. In addition to the aforementioned 65 microorganisms, multiple strains of Bordetella bronchiseptica and Bordetella holmesii were also tested for crossreactivity for a total of 71 microorganisms evaluated. Of the 71 microorganisms tested, 66 yielded negative results for $B _ { \cdot }$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis and thus are considered non-reactive with the ARIES Bordetella Assay. Five organisms, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Human Coronavirus OC43, Influenza B, Moraxella catarrhalis and Proteus vulgaris each generated a false positive result in 1 out of 6 replicates.

# MICROBIAL INTERFERENCE

Microbial interference for the ARIES Bordetella Assay was established by testing 65 unique potentially cross reactive microorganisms (CRO) that are commonly found in the nasopharynxand cause infections that might cause similar symptoms to $B$ . pertussis and or $B _ { \cdot }$ . parapertussis. Bacteria were tested at $\geq 1 0 ^ { 6 } \dot { \mathrm { C F U / m L } }$ or the highest available concentration, and viruses were tested at $\geq 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { T C I D } 5 0 / \mathrm { m L }$ or the highest available concentration. The potential cross-reactive organisms (CROs) were spiked into natural negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix containing representative strains of Bordetella pertussis (BP) or Bordetella parapertussis (BPP). The concentration of the $B$ . pertussis and $B _ { \cdot }$ . parapertussis targets were prepared at $3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD. All target strain $+ \mathrm { C R O }$ samples were tested in triplicate $( \mathrm { n } { = } 3 )$ on the ARIES System. Three replicates each of $3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD target with no cross-reactive organism spiked, and natural negative matrix were tested as controls. In addition to the 65 unique microorganisms, multiple strains of Bordetella bronchiseptica and Bordetella holmesii were also tested for microbial interference.

Microbial interference was also evaluated in a co-infection setting where lower ( $3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD) concentration $B$ . pertussis was tested with high concentration (100x LoD) of $B$ parapertussis and vice-versa. The high/low combinations of $B$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis were tested as part of the microbial interference study (Table 9). An overall invalid rate of $0 . 9 \%$ (7/744) was observed during the execution of the microbial interference and cross reactivity study. All invalids were re-run and gave the expected call.

All potential CROs when tested with negative matrix as no template controls (NTCs) gave the expected result of $B$ . pertussis NEGATIVE and $B$ . parapertussis

NEGATIVE during testing. Five CROs (Fusobacterium necrophorum, Human Coronavirus OC43, Influenza B, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Proteus vulgaris) yielded a false positive in 1/3 replicates with late Ct’s but yielded NEGATIVE for all 3 replicates in repeat testing.

All potential CROs when tested with the B. pertussis matrix gave the expected result of B. pertussis POSITIVE. A total of 9 CROs were tested twice in triplicate for a total of 6 replicates. Four CROs (Bordetella bronchiseptica (strain 1), Bordetella petrii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia) yielded a false negative in 1/6 replicates and five CROs (Acientobacter Iwoffii, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum, Bordetella holmesii (strain 3), Coxsackievirus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) yielded a false positive for $B$ . parapertussis in 1/6 replicates when tested in a $B$ . pertussis matrix.

All potential CROs when tested with the $B _ { \cdot }$ . parapertussis matrix gave the expected result of $B$ . parapertussis POSITIVE. B. bronchiseptica at high concentration of $1 0 ^ { 8 }$ $\mathrm { C F U / m L }$ , showed some interference in the ability to detect low concentrations of $B$ . pertussis and $B _ { \cdot }$ . parapertussis. However, no interference was observed at ${ 1 0 } ^ { 6 }$ CFU/mL.

The overall positivity from testing for cross-reactivity and microbial interference is shown in Table 9:

# g. Cross-contamination:

Carry-over and cross contamination for the ARIES Bordetella Assay was evaluated by using thirty high positive $( 1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ ) Bordetella pertussis samples in series alternating with thirty Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis negative (pooled natural negative human nasopharyngeal swab matrix) samples. These samples were tested in an alternating series for a total of 5 consecutive runs using one ARIES system.

All samples gave the expected results of $100 \%$ positivity for positive samples and $100 \%$ negative for negative samples. No INVALIDS were observed from the study.

# h. Assay cut-off:

Each target in the ARIES Bordetella assay $B _ { \cdot }$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis) has a Ct cut-off, Tm window, and Tm Peak Threshold. In addition, the internal sample process control (SPC) also has a corresponding Ct cut-off, Tm window, and Tm Peak Threshold. Collectively, the cut-off values compose the assay protocol file parameters, which are used to determine the assay result for the detection target as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or INVALID. The Assay Protocol File parameters were determined, and their performance in the ARIES Bordetella Assay were evaluated according to the following general procedure:

Initial Assay Protocol File parameters were set during internal optimization studies The final Assay Protocol File parameters were then established during internal verification studies · The selected Assay Protocol File parameter values were utilized in the determination of assay performance in the multi-site clinical trial conducted for the

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable.

b. Matrix comparison:

The compatibility of four collection media— UTM, M5, M6 and ESwab, were evaluated with the ARIES Bordetella Assay using two strains each of $B$ . pertussis and $B _ { \cdot }$ . parapertussis. Each strain of Bordetella was independently diluted in the media at a concentration of $3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD of the ARIES Bordetella Assay for that strain. The study was performed with 20 replicates for each media type and each strain of Bordetella, and 3 replicates for each media type by itself as the negative control.

All media evaluated generated $100 \%$ positive results for $B$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis with the exception of UTM, which generated a $9 5 \%$ positive result for one strain of $B$ . pertussis. However, the results met the evaluation criteria of at least $9 5 \%$ positivity for all targets. The negative sample gave a result of $100 \%$ negative for both Bordetella targets with $100 \%$ detection of the DNA SPC target. An overall invalid rate of $1 . 2 \%$ (4/336) was observed during this study.

Evaluation of mean $\mathrm { C t }$ and mean Tm values indicated no trends in performance between the different types of collection media. The average $\mathrm { C t }$ for $B$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis among all media was very similar, and within ${ \sim } 1$ cycle of each other. The study results demonstrate that these collection media, UTM, M5, M6 and ESwab perform similarly when used with the ARIES Bordetella Assay.

The nasopharyngeal swab equivalency study was executed using one strain each of $B$ pertussis and $B _ { \cdot }$ . parapertussis applied independently to three different nasopharyngeal swab types (flocked, rayon, and polyester).

Results generated showed that all swab types gave the expected results of $100 \%$ positivity for $B$ . pertussis and $B .$ . parapertussis. The negative sample also gave the expected results of $100 \%$ negative for both Bordetella targets with $100 \%$ detection of the DNA SPC target. An overall invalid rate of $0 \%$ (0/69) was observed during this study.

Evaluation of mean $\mathrm { C t }$ and mean Tm values indicated no trends in performance between the different types of nasopharyngeal swab types. The average $\mathrm { C t }$ for $B$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis across all swab types was very similar and within ${ \sim } 1$ Ct of each other and the positive control. The study results demonstrated that these collection swabs performed similarly when used with the ARIES Bordetella assay.

# 3. Clinical Performance:

A clinical evaluation was conducted (Table 11) to determine the diagnostic performance of the ARIES Bordetella Assay in nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from subjects with clinical signs and symptoms consistent with $B .$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis infection. The clinical and contrived specimens were assayed at the testing sites, following the sponsor’s instructions. Upon completion of the ARIES Bordetella Assay runs, the clinical study results were reviewed by the sponsor, and the data management group conducted final analyses.

a Site 04 was originally selected for the study but was later disqualified (prior to study initiation) due to logistical constraints $^ { \mathbf { b } } \mathbf { A l l }$ prospective specimens collected at Site 06 were sent frozen on dry- ice to Site 01 for ARIES Bordetella Assay testing

In order to ensure that the study was statistically powered, a sufficient number of prospectively collected specimens were included in order to achieve at least $9 5 \%$ sensitivity with a lower bound of the 2-sided $9 5 \%$ CI greater than $8 5 \%$ . Based on an estimated $B$ . pertussis prevalence of approximately ${ \sim } 5 \%$ in the intended use population, it was anticpated that the inclusion of 1000 specimens would be sufficient in order to obtain at least 50 positive specimens for determining Positive Percent Agreement.

# SAMPLE PROCESSING AND STORAGE

All prospective clinical specimens (nasopharyngeal swabs in Universal Transport Media) were submitted fresh to the institutions’ clinical laboratories and were processed according to their standard procedures. The time from specimen collection to receipt at the clinical laboratories was kept to a minimum ${ < } 2 4$ hours). Upon receipt at the laboratory, any left-over specimen that met the study inclusion/exclusion criteria was blinded and assigned a unique clinical study specimen number by an individual at the site who was not directly involved in the study.

Multiple aliquots of the fresh left-over specimen were then generated and placed into sterile, leak-proof containers. All specimens were tested within the validated specimen stability parameters. Table 12 shows a summary of the specimen processing:

The performance of the ARIES Bordetella Assay was established using a composite comparator assay consisting of 2 well-characterized real time-PCR assays (for each bacterial pathogen) followed by confirmation of positive PCR amplification product with bi-directional sequencing. The comparator PCR assays for $B .$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis targeted unique sequences (i.e. different from those targeted by the ARIES Bordetella assay) within the promoter region of the ptxA (toxin promoter) and IS1001 insertion region, respectively.

Specimens were characterized as positive for $B _ { \cdot }$ . pertussis or $B$ . parapertussis if both comparator PCR assays were positive $\mathrm { C t }$ values ${ \le } 4 0 _ { \perp }$ ) or if one of the validated real timePCR assays was positive and a third PCR/sequencing combination assay was positive. Specimens were characterized as $B$ . pertussis or $B$ . parapertussis negative if both comparator PCR assays were negative $\mathrm { ( C t \geq 4 0 ) }$ ).

Comparator testing was performed at an internal testing facility on all clinical specimens that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Clinical runs and re-runs with the ARIES Bordetella Assay were conducted by trained operators at the 4 testing sites (see above table of Participating Investigators and Investigative Sites) on specimens stored refrigerated at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (up to 72hrs) prior to testing $( \mathrm { N } { = } 6 6 7 ; 6 3 . 4 \% )$ or stored frozen at -65 to ${ } _ { - 9 5 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 12 days prior to testing $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { N } = 3 8 5$ ; $3 6 . 6 \%$ ).

# RESULTS

The clinical study results are as follows—

# Arm 1: Blinded, Prospectively Collected Specimens

Performance of the ARIES Bordetella Assay for $B$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis was established using prospectively collected (from 27-July through 08-November 2016), deidentified, left-over nasopharyngeal swab specimens in Universal Transport Media accrued at 5 clinical sites. ARIES Bordetella Assay testing was performed by trained operators at each of the collection sites with the exception of one site (Site 06). All clinical specimens accrued at Site 06 during the enrollment period were sent frozen on dry-ice to Site 01 for ARIES testing.

A total of 1053 left-over clinical specimens from pediatric and adult subjects were collected at five (5) US clinical sites and included in the study. A single specimen was obtained per subject and a single measurement was taken per specimen (excluding allowable re-runs).

Out of the 1052 clinical specimens included in the prospective study analysis, 1043 $( 9 9 . 1 \% )$ clinical specimens in the prospective study generated valid ARIES Bordetella Assay results (i.e. positive or negative) on the first attempt. There were 9 specimens (9/1052; $0 . 9 \%$ that were retested with the ARIES Bordetella Assay because they yielded INVALID results in the intial run $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { N } = 3$ ) or because of an instrument error $( \mathrm { N } { = } 6 )$ . All nine specimens generated valid ARIES results upon repeat testing.

A supplemental analysis of the results by specimen state (i.e. fresh vs. frozen) was also performed. Clinical performance of the ARIES Bordetella Assay (after allowable re-runs) based on specimen state were as follows—the ARIES Bordetella Assay Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) for $B .$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis prospective, fresh specimens was reported to be $9 3 . 3 \%$ (14/15; lower bound $9 5 \%$ CI of $6 8 . 1 \%$ ) and $100 \%$ ( $1 / 1$ ; lower bound $9 5 \%$ CI of $2 . 5 \%$ ), respectively. The Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) for $B$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis prospective, fresh specimens was reported to be $9 8 . 8 \%$ (644/652; LB $9 5 \%$ CI of $9 . 6 \%$ ) and $9 9 . 7 \%$ (664/666; LB $9 5 \%$ CI of $9 8 . 9 \%$ ), respectively.

The ARIES Bordetella Assay Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) for $B$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis prospective, frozen specimens was reported to be $9 4 . 1 \%$ (16/17; lower bound $9 5 \%$ CI of $7 1 . 3 \%$ ) and $100 \%$ (1/1; lower bound $9 5 \%$ CI of $2 . 5 \%$ ), respectively. The Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) for $B$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis prospective, frozen specimens was reported to be $9 9 . 2 \%$ (365/368; LB $9 5 \%$ CI of $9 7 . 6 \%$ and $100 \%$ (384/384; LB $9 5 \%$ CI of $9 9 . 0 \%$ ), respectively.

# Arm 2: Blinded, Pre-selected Specimens

Because both $B$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis are low prevalence analytes in the prospective study cohort, banked (pre-selected) positive specimens were collected at selected sites. Pre-selected specimens were characterized by the same comparator method as that used in the prospective study. In order to minimize bias, pre-selected specimens were tested along with an equal number of unique negative clinical specimens in a randomized, blinded fashion at three (3) testing sites (all of which were external to Luminex). Results from pre-selected specimens were analyzed separately from those of the prospective data set.

A total of 57 unique, pre-selected, de-identified, $B$ . pertussis and $B _ { \cdot }$ . parapertussis positive nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from pediatric and adult subjects. A total of $3 7 B .$ . pertussis positive specimens were obtained from 6 collection sites in the United States and $2 0 B .$ . parapertussis positive specimens were collected at 3 sites in the United States.

All pre-selected $B$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis positive specimens were previously characterized using the method routinely used at the collection site. The expected result for each of the pre-selected specimens was confirmed by comparator real-time PCR and bi-directional sequencing assays. Pre-selected specimens were randomized and blinded by an individual who was not directly involved in the study. The following table provides a summary of subject demographic information (i.e. age and gender) from the 57 preselected clinical specimens.

All 37 pre-selected $B$ . pertussis specimens were distributed and tested with the ARIES Bordetella Assay at 3 external clinical sites, along with 37 unique negative clinical specimens in a randomized, blinded fashion. All 20 pre-selected $B$ . parapertussis specimens were tested with ARIES Bordetella Assay at one external clinical site, along with 20 unique negative clinical specimens in a randomized, blinded fashion. All but 1 of the positive and negative samples included in the pre-selected sample set generated valid ARIES Bordetella Assay results on the first attempt. The invalid result (Sample ID #01-198) was resolved upon re-test.

Due to the limited number of clinical samples positive for $B$ . parapertussis in the prospective and pre-selected arm of the study, additional testing was performed using contrived specimens. Contrived samples were prepared by spiking varying concentrations of cultured strains into unique negative human nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Two strains of $B$ . parapertussis (A747 and BAA-587; used in the LoD study were evaluated in these spiking experiments. A thorough review of the literature was unable to yield clinically relevant titers for $B$ . parapertussis. Hence, the range was determined based on the evaluations of the cycle thresholds $\mathrm { ( C t ) }$ from archived $B$ . parapertussis positive clinical samples. Based on that evaluation, $1 0 { - } 1 0 0 \mathrm { x }$ LoD was determined to accurately represent the clinically relevant range of $B$ . parapertussis samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs.

Fifty (50) contrived specimens spanning the clinically relevant range were prepared with relevant $B$ . parapertussis strains. Near LoD specimens were prepared at 2-3xLoD while the remaining specimens were prepared at $1 0 \mathrm { x }$ and $1 0 0 \mathrm { x }$ LoD concentrations. Bacterial organism concentrations were verified by culture methods (plating and colony count) and reported as CFU/mL. In order to minimize bias, contrived specimens were tested along with an equal number (50) of unique negative specimens in a randomized, blinded fashion at 3 testing sites as was performed for Arm 2 (pre-selected specimens). The negative designation for these 50 specimens was confirmed by comparator real-time PCR assays. A summary of the contrived sample set is as follows:

b. Level of Concern: Moderate   
c. Device Hazard Analysis: Acceptable

The risks associated with the ARIES Systems and Software were reviewed as part of previous premarket notifications—

K151917 (ARIES System with ARIES Software)   
· K160517 (ARIES System with ARIES Software plus SYNCT Software)   
· K161220 (Updated ARIES Software for the ARIES System) K161495 (ARIES M1 System with ARIES Software plus SYNCT Software)

The risks specific to the ARIES Bordetella Assay were also detailed by the firm. Risks were managed based on the ISO 14971 risk management standard. 7 types of hazards and 62 possible causes leading to the hazards were identified with the ARIES Bordetella Assay. Risk evaluation of each of these possible causes related to each hazard type, identified multiple combinations of hazards and potential causes. Risk control activities identified 30 methods of control that could be implemented and applied across multiple combinations of hazards and potential causes. In all, there were 465 combinations of hazards with possible causes, and related methods of control. 220 of the 465 were considered ACCEPTABLE in initial risk estimate by the firm, requiring no further mitigation. 146 had initial risk estimates that were considered for further risk mitigation.

Mitigation measures were implemented by the firm so that all risks were reduced to acceptable levels. Mitigation measures included proper labeling and training, conduct of analytical and clinical studies to determine proper configuration of assay components (i.e. primer design, cut-off definition, and determination of parameter configurations) for generating appropriate clinical results, implementation of sample processing controls, and use of barcoding to specific the appropriate parameter protocol file.

d. Architecture Design Chart: Acceptable

This was previous reviewed with the ARIES Software as part of premarket notifications K151917, K160517, and K161495.

e. Software Description: Acceptable

The ARIES Systems include software which manages operations of the

instrument including—

the manipulation of sample and reagent movement within the assay cassette,   
· control heaters for lysis,   
· elution,   
· nucleic acid amplification,   
· controlling the fluorimeter for real-time PCR bulk fluorescence detection and melt analysis, controlling thermal and optical calibration, and performing data analysis for IVD assays run on the system

The software resides entirely on the instrument, a separate PC is not required. Assay-specific parameters, suchas target-specific Tm and Ct cutoffs, are communicated to the ARIES software for a specific assay like the ARIES Bordetella Assay through a protocol file that is provided as part of the specific assay kit and installed on the ARIES instrument.

Premarket notification K161495 demonstrated that the intended use and fundamental scientific technology did not change for the ARIES M1 System, and was substantially equivalent to the ARIES System and included software.

The software interpretation algorithm used to determine test results was coded by the firm into the protocol file, using the ARIES Assay Protocol Software. The ARIES Software determined test results for the sample and the sample processing control (SPC) based on the amplification cycle (Ct) value, the melting temperature value (Tm), and Tm threshold values as defined in the ARIES Bordetella Assay Protocol File. The combination of these assay parameters and the interpretation of the sample results for the ARIES Bordetella Assay are illustrated as follows:

$( + )$ Indicates that a valid $\mathrm { C t }$ value is present. $( > )$ Indicates that the $\mathrm { C t }$ value obtained is above the $\mathrm { C t }$ cutoff. (-) Indicates that a valid $\mathrm { C t }$ value is not present. (N/A) Not applicable. All possible outcomes will result in the same call.

In brief, if there are any samples that meet the Tm criteria without a corresponding Ct value (i.e. no valid Ct value) for the corresponding $B$ . pertussis or $B$ . parapertussis target, then the result is INVALID. Further, if a Ct value for both targets has exceeded threshold but the Tm criteria is met, but the SPC does not have a valid Ct value then the result is INVALID. Both the Tm and Ct criteria must be met for the corresponding $B$ . pertussis or $B$ . parapertussis target for a positive call for the respective organism. All negative specimens for $B$ . pertussis and B. parapertussis must have a positive internal sample processing control (SPC). If the SPC is negative, the result is INVALID.
