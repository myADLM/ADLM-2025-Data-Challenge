2. Classification: Class II

3. Product code:

OCC – Respiratory Virus Panel Nucleic Acid Assay System

4. Panel: Microbiology (83)

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The Idylla Respiratory (IFV-RSV) Panel is an in vitro assay intended for the qualitative detection of nucleic acids for Influenza A, Influenza A subtype H1, Influenza A subtype H3, Influenza A subtype 2009 H1, H275Y mutation of Influenza A subtype 2009 H1, Influenza B and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (A and B) from nasopharyngeal swabs in viral transport media of adult and pediatric patients. The test uses the Idylla system to aid in the diagnosis of respiratory viral infection when used in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings.

Negative results do not preclude respiratory virus infection or co-infection with other viruses and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other patient management decisions.

Performance characteristics for Influenza A were established when influenza A/2009 H1 and H3 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other Influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary. If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a ${ \mathrm { B S L } } 3 +$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

2. Indication(s) for use: Same as Intended Use

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For Prescription Use

4. Special instrument requirements: To be used only with the Idylla instrument

# I. Device Description:

The Idylla Respiratory Panel is a self-contained molecular in vitro diagnostic test intended to work with the Idylla System. The assay is performed using a single-use, disposable, multichambered fluidic cartridge. The assay process includes automated sample preparation/ purification, reverse transcription and real-time, multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for the detection of viral RNA. All steps in this process are all fully automated and completely integrated; results are available in less than 50 minutes.

To perform the assay, a nasopharyngeal (NPS) sample is added to the cartridge lysis pad. The cartridge lid is then closed and placed in the cartridge tray on the Idylla Instrument. Once the tray is closed, the test begins automatically. Once started, cartridge manifolds move the specimen and reagents systematically through the cartridge fluidics from sample lysis, nucleic acid purification, mixing of PCR reagents, and finally amplification and signal detection. All amplification, detection of fluorescence, and the interpretation of the signals are done automatically by the Idylla System. The Idylla Console provides a qualitative result for the presence (Detected) or absence (Not Detected) for influenza A, influenza B, RSV, and subtyping information for influenza A positive samples, including H1, H3, 2009 H1, and H275Y. Results are displayed on the Idylla Console and uploaded to the laboratory information system.

# Interpretation of results:

Each of the amplified targets has a unique type of fluorophore attached to their respective probe that is cleaved by the exonuclease activity of the Taq polymerase enzyme allowing for the identification and differentiation of the target viruses. Each gene marker is detected using fluorescent molecules with different excitation and emission wavelengths. Light generated by the released fluorophore(s) is captured by a photodetector and is translated into a fluorescent signal.

# Quality Control

The Idylla Respiratory Panel test contains a sample processing control (SPC) in each cartridge. The SPC checks for adequate sample processing and downstream amplification and is co-amplified in each reaction chamber to ensure no PCR inhibitors were present in the sample. A SPC signal is required in every chamber for a “negative” result to be reported. In the event that no influenza or RSV signal is detected and there is no SPC signal, the cartridge is “invalid”. In positive samples where target amplification is strong, the SPC is ignored and the target amplification serves as the ‘control’ to confirm that the sample was not inhibitory and that assay reagent performance was robust.

Negative and positive controls should be run according to local, state, and federal accrediting organization requirements.

Reproducibility Study

A reproducibility study of the IFV-RSV was conducted by operators from three sites using panels of coded specimens containing negative, near the cutoff $\left( \mathrm { C } _ { 2 0 } – \mathrm { C } _ { 8 0 } \right)$ , low positive (at the limit of detection), and moderate positive (above the limit of detection) panel analyte samples. Two Operators tested three replicates each twice daily for six days for a total of 36 tests per site for each panel member at a specific analyte concentration.

Participants tested multiple samples of each panel member on six different days. The percent agreement with expected results was $100 \%$ for all panel members except influenza B in the moderate positive and low positive test categories (Influenza B low positive overall agreement was $9 9 . 1 \%$ ). All of the true negative samples (108) generated negative test results. There were no significant differences observed within run (replicates tested by one operator), between run (five different days), between sites (three sites), or between operators (six operators).

The Reproducibility Study site-to-site qualitative results (agreements with expected results) are presented in the table below.

Specimen Stability

To provide data supporting the specimen storage recommendations stated in the product package insert, an analytical study was carried out to evaluate specimen stability.

Positive specimens were freshly diluted into a simulated negative background matrix spiked into VTM to approximate the required target concentrations at a moderate positive (5x LoD), and tested in replicates of 10 per condition. An additional subset of 10 negative samples was analyzed per sample per condition. A total of 60 cartridges were tested (30 positive and 30 negative). All specimens were tested with the Idylla System on the day the samples were prepared. Test conditions for this study were: 0 hours, 2 hours at room temperature $( 1 5 . 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ , and 24 hours refrigerated at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Results of the specimen stability study are shown in the tables below.

All samples generated expected results for each storage condition at each storage time point.

The Product Insert states that samples can be stored in VTM at room temperature for up to 2 hours or at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 24 hours.

This study was performed with contrived positive and negative specimens. A background matrix was made using negative human donor matrix samples, re-suspended in VTM for NPS testing. The positive simulated specimens were spiked into VTM media, and serially diluted to the appropriate panel concentrations. Contrived negative specimens consisted of simulated background matrix only and were added to VTM. For NP samples, contrived specimens were tested fresh (at time of serial dilutions) and after 2 freeze/thaw cycles (2 F/T) for a total of 30 paired tests for the low (2x LoD) concentration panel members. Each freeze/thaw cycle consisted of a minimum of 48 hours at $\mathrm { { \le - 7 0 } ^ { \circ } C }$ , followed by a thaw at $1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 1 hour prior to re-freezing or testing. Positive specimens in the study consisted of a panel of the 3 viral strains, representing the target viruses. Influenza A 2009 H1N1, Influenza B, and RSVA were selected as representative markers. Results for testing the low concentration panel members are shown in the table below.

# Shelf Life

Janssen performed a product stability study to generate stability data to support the expiry assigned to IFV-RSV test kits. Three lots of Idylla cartridges were tested in support of claimed shelf life. The product lots were tested minimally at Month 0 (QC Release), 6, 7, 12, and 13 months. Testing occurred within 2 weeks of the targeted date. The Idylla Respiratory (IFV-RSV) Panel is stable when unopened up to 13 months. Janssen intends to test additional time points to extend the shelf life.

# Swab Type Compatibility Study

Janssen performed a swab type validation study to establish which swabs are acceptable for use with the IFV-RSV assay. Swabs tested in this study include: Puritan HydraFlock Flocked Swab, Puritan UltraFlock, Copan Flocked Swab; Copan Pediatric Mid Turbinate Flocked Swab; and Copan Adult Mid Turbinate Flocked Swab. Positive specimens in this study were freshly prepared. Positive specimens were tested in replicates of 10 per each specimen (5x LoD) and swab type $( \mathrm { n } { = } 5 )$ ; along with negative specimens as controls. A total of 100 cartridges were tested (50 positive and 50 negative). All specimens were tested with the Idylla system on the same day as preparation. Agreement at $100 \%$ was demonstrated for both 5x LoD and negative specimens when tested using all Copan and Puritan flocked swabs tested.

Janssen performed a study to determine the validity of commonly used viral transport media for use with the Idylla Respiratory Panel. Contrived positive specimens consisted of cultured viral targets diluted into a simulated background matrix (negative matrix). This background matrix was made using pooled negative human donor swab samples resuspended in one of the VTMs. Each pool of negative matrix was tested to confirm the absence of influenza and RSV prior to the study. All replicates were correctly called negative in each type of media used. The positive specimens were diluted into the negative background matrix at a 1000x LoD concentration, then diluted in the appropriate medium under investigation to approximate the required target concentrations at a moderate positive ( $5 \mathbf { x }$ LoD). Each panel simultaneously detected FluA, 2009H1, FluB, and RSVA. The positive specimens were diluted into the negative background matrix made for each media type and tested in replicates of 10 per each specimen (5x LoD and Negative) and media $( \mathrm { n } { = } 6 )$ . A total of 120 cartridges were tested (60 positive and 60 negative). All specimens were tested with the Idylla System on the day they were prepared. Agreement at $100 \%$ was demonstrated for both 5x LoD and negative specimens when tested using Remel media (M4, M4-RT, M5, M6), Copan UTM, and Cepheid GeneXpert Influenza Virus VTM. Results are shown in the tables below.

# d. Detection limit:

The objective of the Analytical Sensitivity Study was to identify the limit of detection of the IFV-RSV using characterized strains of each analyte target. The analytical sensitivity was determined using quantified cultures of 8 Influenza A (2 each of AH1, AH3, 2009 H1 and $2 0 0 9 \mathrm { H } 1 + \mathrm { H } 2 7 5 \mathrm { Y }$ Genotype), 2 Influenza B, 2 Respiratory Syncytial Virus Type A (RSVA), and 2 Respiratory Syncytial Virus Type B (RSVB) strains serially diluted. The LoD for each strain was defined as the lowest concentration at which $2 9 5 \%$ of the 20 tested replicates were detected by the system for each clinical sample type.

Three replicates of each dilution level were tested at $2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ sample addition. At the lowest dilution level in which 3/3 replicates were detected, confirmation of LoD for each target was achieved by testing 20 replicates at this level with minimum reported “Detected” result in $9 5 \%$ of the cartridges tested $( \geq 1 9 / 2 0 )$ using $2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of sample. For $5 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ sample addition, 3 replicates were analyzed at the equivalent concentration as determined for LoD with $2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ sample addition, followed by a minimum of 2 additional dilutions lower in replicates of 3. If testing of 2-fold dilutions did not generate a $9 5 \%$ positive result, dilutions that were half-way between the lowest $100 \%$ positive 2-fold dilution and the 2-fold dilution below it were tested until a dilution testing $9 5 \%$ positive was determined. The empirically determined LoD for each Influenza and RSV strain is shown in the table below.

# e. Analytical reactivity:

An analytical reactivity study was completed to determine whether the Idylla Respiratory (IFV-RSV) Panel can detect a variety of Influenza A, Influenza B, RSVA and RSVB strains that represent both temporal and geographic diversity.

The analytical reactivity (inclusivity) of the Idylla Respiratory (IFV-RSV) Panel was determined using quantified cultures of Influenza A (subtypes H1, H3, H1N12009 +/- H275Y mutation), Influenza B, RSVA and RSVB strains. The virus was diluted into a VTM containing a donor swab. Each strain was run in triplicate at 2X LoD using both sample volumes, $2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ and $5 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ . Concentrations used for analytical reactivity (inclusivity) claims were calculated based on the reported LoD. A summary of the results of the reactivity testing is presented in the table below.

\*FluMist was not tested as it was not available in the market at the time of testing. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that FluMist not be used for the 2016-2017 season.

The potentially interfering substances were evaluated in the presence of viral targets spiked near 2x LoD consisting of Influenza A (all subtypes detected in IFV), Influenza B and RSV A/B. No evidence of interference caused by these substances was found.

Each interfering substance was tested in triplicate using VTM samples containing 5x LoD of each target at a $5 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ sample volume. To create the interferent test sample, positive simulated specimens were created at $1 0 \mathrm { x } \ \mathrm { L o D }$ , and spiked into VTM media containing the background matrix. For each interferent, the final concentration was obtained by combining a $2 \mathbf { x }$ concentration of the interfering substance with $2 5 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the concentrated $1 0 \mathrm { x }$ LoD panel into a final $5 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ volume, resulting in the final ${ 5 } \mathrm { x }$ LoD concentration of each analyte and the reported final interferent concentration. Each interferent was diluted in the VTM sample containing 5x LoD of each target and tested in triplicate.

# h. Competitive Interference:

The competitive interference study evaluated the effects of clinically relevant coinfections with each of the analytes in the IFV-RST test. The study assessed whether a high concentration of one virus $3 \mathrm { \ l o g s > L o D ) }$ in the specimen could potentially affect the IFV-RSV Panel performance when detecting another target present at low levels in the multiplex Test (approximately 3x LoD). All testing was performed in triplicate. The presence of any virus at high copy number and at LoD in the same Cartridge had no effect on the analytical sensitivity (limit of detection) of the IFVRSV Panel.

i. Carry-over:

Not applicable; all test components are single use and no reagents come into contact with the instrument.

# $j .$ . Assay cut-off:

The initial assay cutoff was determined by testing a population of known influenza and respiratory syncytial virus positive and negative samples. A “curve classification” method was then used (Ct offset settings applied to curve analysis) to analyze each PCR curve and determine if the target was detected by finding an exponential growth curve; or else the target was not detected. Next, human experts analyzed each curve in a blinded setting, with the experts reporting curves as positive or negative. The final algorithm was designed to maximize the IFV-RSV Panel LoD while maintaining the assay’s specificity. Clinical samples of known influenza and RSV status $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n } = 2 0 4 )$ ) were tested to determine the percent agreement to Culture or NAT method. The PPA and NPA were calculated and the results support that the test correctly identifies the target analytes.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable. Performance of the IFV-RSV was evaluated against the reference method in a prospective clinical study.   
b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable.

3. Clinical Studies:

The prospective study consisted of freshly collected specimens obtained during the 2015- 2016 season $( \mathrm { n } { = } 2 1 4 )$ ) as well as frozen prospective samples collected during previous seasons $( 2 0 1 2 - 2 0 1 3 \mathrm { n } { = } 4 9 4$ ; and $2 0 1 3 - 2 0 1 4 { \mathrm { n } } { = } 3 0 6$ ). A total of 1014 prospective samples were collected for use in the clinical study. Of these 1014 samples, fifteen were excluded for protocol deviations or lack of a comparator result, leaving 999 specimens. Since multiple specimen types were collected, not every patient was able to supply all the specimens intended for the study. For $2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ NPS specimens in VTM, 986 were available for testing. For $5 0 0 ~ \mu \updownarrow$ NPS specimens in VTM, 956 were available for testing. There were 26 and 27 QC failures for NPS $2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ and NP $5 0 0 ~ \mu \updownarrow$ specimens, respectively leaving final evaluable specimens of $\scriptstyle \mathrm { n = 9 6 0 }$ (NPS $2 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l } \dot { } ,$ ) and $\mathrm { n } { = } 9 2 9$ (NPS $5 0 0 \mu \mathrm { l } )$ . The invalid rate during the clinical study was $2 . 9 \%$ .

Sequencing results confirmed four samples as RSV negative and nine samples as RSV positive.

A separate study was performed using nasopharyngeal swab specimens from archived banked retrospective clinical collections tested on the Idylla Respiratory (IFV RSV) Panel and comparator Assays. Testing of the IFV-RSV Panel was conducted by three operators on the three Idylla Systems for both $2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ and $5 0 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ samples. A total of 419 patient samples were tested at $2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ with 408 reported results, (invalid rate of $1 \%$ ) and a total of 449 patient samples were tested at $5 0 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ with 418 reported results (invalid rate of $7 \%$ ). The results for the retrospective testing for each target, including Positive and Negative Agreement for the comparison study, are presented in the following tables. The IFV-RSV Panel performance was compared to an FDA-cleared Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT).

Testing of 40 contrived samples containing Influenza A virus with the H275Y mutation was performed by introducing the contrived samples into the frozen sample testing workflow. Each sample returned a positive result by the comparator method for Influenza A H1 2009 and a negative result for all other targets. These samples were then tested for the H275Y mutation using a validated bidirectional sequencing assay. Each of these returned a positive H275Y mutation result from the bidirectional sequencing assay. Using the IFV–RSV assay to test the same 40 contrived specimens, each of the valid test results was positive for Influenza A H1 2009 and the H275Y mutation

Idylla Instrument

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

The Idylla Respiratory Panel is a self-contained molecular in vitro diagnostic test designed to work with the Idylla System. The Idylla System consists of the Idylla console connected to between one and eight Idylla Instruments, and the test cartridge. The Idylla Instrument’s function is the automated processing of Idylla Test specific cartridges. Processing is triggered by the user loading a cartridge into the instrument. Upon loading of a cartridge into the Instrument, the Instrument automatically processes the test specific cartridges according to the corresponding Test specific software that provides instructions for processing of PCR fluorescence data into reportable results. The Instrument’s front panel acts as the Instrument’s user interface. It has a button to open and close the cartridge tray, and it uses LEDs (indicator lamps) to indicate the status of the Instrument.
