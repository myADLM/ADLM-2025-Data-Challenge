# I. Device Description:

The E. HISTOLYTICA QUIK CHEK test uses antibodies to adhesin. The device contains a reaction window with two vertical lines of immobilized antibodies. The test line (“T”) contains monoclonal antibodies specific for $E .$ histolytica adhesin. The control line $\left( ^ { \infty } \mathbf { C } ^ { \infty } \right)$ contains antibodies to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The Conjugate consists of polyclonal antibodies to $E .$ . histolytica adhesin coupled to horseradish peroxidase. The “T” reaction is examined visually for the appearance of a vertical blue line on the “T” side of the Reaction Window. A blue line indicates a positive test. A positive “C” reaction, indicated by a vertical blue line on the $^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ^ { \circ \circ }$ side of the reaction window, monitors/confirms that the sample and reagents were added correctly, the reagents were active at the time of performing the assay, and that the sample migrated properly through the membrane device. It also confirms the reactivity of the other reagents associated with the assay.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision of the E. HISTOLYTICA QUIK CHEK test was determined using an eight member masked fecal specimen panel. The panel consisted of 2 negative, 2 high negative (just below C5), 2 low positive (just above LoD), and 2 moderate positive ( $2 { - } 3 \mathbf { x }$ higher than the C95) specimens. Each fecal specimen was spiked using whole organism to achieve the desired level. The Specimens were tested twice a day over a 12 day period by multiple technicians using two different kit lots. Positive and negative controls were run with each sample panel of masked specimens. The positive specimens tested positive $100 \%$ of the time and the negative specimens tested negative $100 \%$ of the time. The samples produced the expected result $100 \%$ of the time.

The reproducibility of the E. HISTOLYTICA QUIK CHEK test was determined using eight masked fecal specimen panel prepared the same way as described for the precision study. Testing was performed at 2 independent laboratories and on-site at TECHLAB, Inc. The Specimens were tested twice a day over a five day period by multiple technicians at each site using two different kit lots. Positive and negative controls were run with each sample panel of masked specimens. The result from each laboratory were submitted to TECHLAB Inc. and compared. The results were consistent among all three locations and exhibited a correlation of $100 \%$ . The samples produced the expected result $100 \%$ of the time.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Storage stability study:

The effect of specimen storage on antigen stability was evaluated for both fresh samples and samples in transport media. For the analysis, a total of 15 fecal specimens were tested with the E. HISTOLYTICA QUIK CHEK test. The fecal specimens consisted 3 negative fecal samples, $3 ~ E .$ . histolytica low positive fecal samples (1-2 times C95 for whole organisms), $3 E$ . histolytica moderate positive fecal samples (2-3 times C95 for whole organism), and $3 E$ . histolytica high positive fecal samples (4-5 times C95 for whole organism). Both fresh samples and samples stored in transport media were tested.

For fresh samples, samples were stored between $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and tested at 24 hour intervals for 120 hours. At the same time positive and negative controls were tested. The following transport media were used for the study: Thermo Scientific Protocol Cary Blair media and Meridian Bioscience Inc., Para-Pak C&S. As recommended in the Cary Blair package insert, Cary Blair samples were stored between $2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . C&S samples were stored at both refrigerated $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and prevailing room temperature ( $1 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) conditions as indicated in the package insert. Samples stored in transport media were tested at 24 hour intervals for 120 hours. At the same time positive and negative controls were tested.

Positive samples remained positive and negative samples remained negative throughout the study. Storage in transport media did not affect the stability of the samples. Based on these results, the recommended storage time for fresh samples is up to 120 hours between $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , Cary Blair transport media is up to 96 hours between $2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and C&S transport media is up to 120 hours between $2 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ based on the data and the package insert recommendation.

Frozen stability:

The frozen stability tests were determined for raw stool specimens using 15 masked fecal specimens panel prepared the same way as was described for the storage stability study. Samples were stores at $\leq - 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 28 weeks. Specimens were tested at 0, 1, 4, 6, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 28 weeks. Positive samples remained positive and negative samples remained negative throughout the study.

Freeze/Thaw:

Freeze/Thaw stability for Cary Blair and C&S media compared to raw specimens was demonstrated for one Freeze/Thaw cycle. 60 masked samples were tested, ten true negative, ten high negative (just belowC5 (whole organisms)), thirty low positives (1- 2 times C95 (whole organisms)), and ten high positives (4-5 x LoD (whole organisms)) were tested for each transport media and raw stool. Based on the data submitted, the freeze-thaw cycle neither enhances nor impairs the performance of the E. HISTOLYTICA QUIK CHEK test.

# d. Detection limit:

The cutoff point (limit of detection, LOD) for the E. HISTOLYTICA QUIK CHEK test was determined using whole organism spiked into unpreserved (raw stool) and preserved (Cary Blair and C&S media). Additional testing of spiked purified native antigen into raw stool was also performed. The cutoff is the concentrations of organisms or antigen that yields a positive result $9 5 \%$ of the time and a negative result $5 \%$ of the time. The cutoff point was determined as the concentration that provided the correct result $9 5 \%$ of the time based on testing dilutions of whole organism and purified antigen in a negative fecal sample matrix, in replicates of 20.

The LoD for the $E .$ . HISTOLYTICA QUIK CHEK test was determined to be 320 organisms $/ \mathrm { m L }$ (equivalent to 15 organisms detected per test) or $0 . 2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ of adhesin in raw stool. For specimens in Cary Blair media, the LoD was established at 275 organisms/mL (equivalent to 14 organisms detected per test). For specimens in C&S media, the LoD was established at 245 organisms/mL (equivalent to 12 organism detected per test). No testing with adhesin was conducted in Cary Blair media or C&S.

Cross reactivity.

The E. HISTOLYTICA QUIK CHEK test was evaluated for cross-reactivity with the bacteria and viruses listed below. None of the strains were shown to interfere with the performance of the E. HISTOLYTICA QUIK CHEK test. Bacteria was spiked at concentration of ${ > } 1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ and viruses at a range from $1 0 ^ { 3 . 3 }$ to $1 0 ^ { 8 . 7 5 } \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 }$ units per $0 . 2 \mathrm { m L }$ .

f. Assay cut-off:

Not applicable g. Prozone:

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that a high concentration of $E$ . histolytica adhesion (antigen) does not interfere with a positive reaction in the $E$ . HISTOLYTICA QUIK CHEK test. High samples were prepared by spiking a negative fecal pool with $2 0 { , } 0 0 0 \mathbf { x }$ the LoD described in section M.1.c above down to a concentration possibly observed in clinical specimens. A total of 5 different dilutions of the analyte, including the clinically observed high concentration, were prepared and tested. Testing was performed in triplicate according to the Package Insert instructions. The results below demonstrated that there was no overall hook affect, that elevated levels of analyte did not affect the detection of the analyte.

It should be noted additional discrepant analysis was done on the three false positive results because all three were microscopy negative, FDA cleared multiplex NAAT test positive and alternate PCR positive. Additional testing was performed and all three samples were determined to be negative by an alternative antigen test.

Retrospective Study

Retrospective testing consisted of 96 archived specimens previously collected and frozen. The Frozen samples are characterized as microscopy and NAAT positive for inclusion into the specimen bank. The specimens were collected form an $E$ . histolytica endemic area. Table 3 below summarizes the performance observed
