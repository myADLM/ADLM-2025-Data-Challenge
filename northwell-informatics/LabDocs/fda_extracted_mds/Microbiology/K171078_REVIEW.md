# I. Device Description:

The TRI-COMBO PARASITE SCREEN test is an enzyme immunoassay for the simultaneous qualitative detection of Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp. and/or $E .$ . histolytica antigen in human fecal specimens. The test uses monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to cell-surface antigens of Giardia, Cryptosporidium and E. histolytica. The microassay plate in the kit contains immobilized monoclonal antibodies against the antigens, and the Conjugate consists of polyclonal antibodies against the antigens. In the assay, an aliquot of a diluted fecal specimen is transferred to a microassay well. The immobilized monoclonal antibodies bind the Giardia, Cryptosporidium and/or $E .$ . histolytica antigens if they are present. Upon addition, Conjugate then binds to the antigen/ antibody complex. Any unbound materials are removed during the washing steps. Following the addition of Substrate, a color is detected due to the enzyme-antibody-antigen complexes that formed in the presence of antigens and conjugate. The color if positive is a yellow color that may be read visually or at the following wave lengths $4 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ or $4 5 0 / 6 2 0 \ \mathrm { N m }$ .

# L. Test Principle:

Enzyme Linked Immunosorbant Assay

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision of the TRI-COMBO PARASITE SCREEN test was determined using a masked fecal specimen panel comprised of 24 specimens spiked with different levels of whole organisms. The samples were prepared using a negative fecal pool and spiked with the following organisms individually Giardia cysts, Cryptosporidium oocysts or $E$ . histolytica whole organisms. The panel consisted of two negative specimens, two high negative specimens (just below C5), two low positive specimens (just above LoD), and two moderate positive ( $2 { - } 3 \mathbf { x }$ higher than the C95) specimens for each of the three organisms (eight specimens for each organism). Each fecal specimen was spiked using whole organism to achieve the desired level. The specimens were tested twice a day over a 12 day period by multiple technicians using two different kit lots. Positive and negative controls were run with each sample panel of masked specimens. The positive specimens tested positive $100 \%$ of the time and the negative specimens tested negative $100 \%$ of the time (Only 2 of 1152 test results for the masked specimens were misclassified).

The reproducibility of the TRI-COMBO PARASITE SCREEN test was determined using masked fecal specimen panel comprised of 20 specimens spiked with different levels of whole organisms that were prepared the same way as described for the precision study except that the same two negatives were used for all three sample

types. Testing was performed at two independent external laboratories and one internal site at TECHLAB, Inc. The specimens were tested twice a day over a five day period by multiple technicians at each site using two different kit lots. Positive and negative controls were run with each sample panel of masked specimens. The result from each laboratory were submitted to TECHLAB Inc. and compared. The results were consistent among all three locations.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Storage stability study   
The effect of specimen storage on antigen stability was evaluated for both fresh samples and samples in transport media. The following transport media were used for the study: Thermo Scientific Protocol Cary Blair media and Meridian Bioscience Inc., Para-Pak C&S. For the analysis, a total of 39 fecal specimens were tested with the TRI-COMBO PARASITE SCREEN test. The samples were prepared using a negative fecal pool and spiked with the following organisms individually Giardia cysts, Cryptosporidium oocysts or $E .$ . histolytica whole organisms. The panel   
consisted of three negative specimens used for all three anayltes, three high negative (just below C5), three low positive (just above LoD), three moderate positive (2-3x higher than the C95) and three high positive (4-5x higher than the C95) specimens for each of the three organisms (12 for each and three negatives used for all three organisms). Each fecal specimen was spiked using whole organism to achieve the desired level.

Fresh samples were stored at refrigerated temperatures (between $2 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and were tested at day 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10. For refrigerated conditions, the positive and negative specimens gave the expected results $100 \%$ of the time.

Fecal specimens added to Cary Blair were transported as recommended in the Cary Blair package insert; Cary Blair samples were stored between $2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . ParaPak C&S samples were stored at both refrigerated ( $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and room temperature ( $1 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) conditions as indicated in the package insert. Samples stored in transport media were tested at 24 hour intervals form 0 to 96 hours. Positive and negative controls were tested daily.

Transport media stability:

Storage in transport media affected the stability of the samples. Based on the results from stability studies, the recommended storage times/temperatures are as follows:

For Cary Blair transport media up to 96 hours between $2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ ,

For C&S transport media up to 96 hours between 2 to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and 48 hours between $1 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ based on the study results.

Frozen sample stability:

Stability of frozen raw stool samples was established using 39 masked fecal specimens panel prepared the same way as was described for the storage stability study. Samples were stores at $\leq - 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 8 weeks. Specimens were tested at 0, 1, 4 and 8 weeks. Positive samples remained positive and negative samples remained negative throughout the study.

# Freeze/Thaw

A study was conducted to determine stability after one freeze/thaw cycle for Cary Blair and C&S media compared to raw specimens for each analyte and to support and facilitate testing of samples in analytical and clinical studies. Eighty masked samples were tested [10 true negative, 30 high negative (just belowC5 (whole organisms)), 30 low positives (1-2 times C95 (whole organisms)), and 10 high positives (4-5 x LoD (whole organisms)] were tested for each of the three organisms in each transport media and raw stool. Based on the data submitted, the freeze-thaw cycle enhances the performance for $E .$ . histolytica in raw stool from $0 \%$ detected before freezing to $100 \%$ reactivity for the high negative samples tested after a single freeze thaw cycle. Giardia and Cryptosporidium raw samples demonstrated a slight decrease from $100 \%$ to $8 6 . 7 \%$ reactivity for the high negative samples.

Giardia and Cryptosporidium samples preserved in Cary Blair demonstrated a very slight improvement from $9 3 . 3 \% 1 0 0 \%$ reactivity for the high negative samples only. All other results at different concentrations did not change during the study. Testing for all samples with the TRI-COMBO PARASITE SCREEN was done before and after a single freeze thaw cycle.

The information suggests that there is no influence on sample reactivity after a single freeze-thaw cycle, except for a slight increase the reactivity of the high negative sample.

# d. Detection limit:

The cutoff point (limit of detection, LoD) for the TRI-COMBO PARASITE SCREEN test was determined using whole organism spiked into unpreserved (raw stool) and preserved (Cary Blair and C&S media). The cutoff is the concentrations of Giardia, Cryptosporidium or $E$ . histolytica that yields a positive result $9 5 \%$ of the time and a negative result $5 \%$ of the time. The cutoff point was determined as the concentration that provided the correct result $9 5 \%$ of the time based on testing dilutions of whole organism in a negative fecal sample matrix, in replicates of 20. LoD testing was read at both single and dual wave length reads. The LoD between single wave lengths reads and duel wave length reads was not significantly different; however single wavelength reads trended slightly higher for some but not all analytes and sample types. Single wavelength reads are as follows:

Test results determined the LoD for whole organism in raw stool to be 8450 cysts/mL for Giardia (equivalent to 169) cysts detected per test), 47962 oocysts/mL for

Cryptosporidium (equivalent to 959) oocysts detected per test), and 1676 whole organisms/mL for $E .$ . histolytica (equivalent to 34 whole organisms per test).

Test results determined the LoD for whole organism in stool and Cary Blair to be 34155 cysts/mL for Giardia (equivalent to 427 cysts detected per test), 99456 oocysts/mL for Cryptosporidium (equivalent to 1243 oocysts detected per test), and 4655 whole organisms/mL for $E$ . histolytica (equivalent to 49 whole organisms per test).

Test results determined the LoD for whole organism in stool and C&S to be 37095 cysts/mL for Giardia (equivalent to 464 cysts detected per test), 12299 oocysts/mL for Cryptosporidium (equivalent to 1529 oocysts detected per test), and 3948 whole organisms $\mathrm { \Delta } m \mathrm { L }$ for $E .$ . histolytica (equivalent to 49 whole organisms per test).

There was no significant difference observed for samples stored in transport media compared to fresh fecal samples when accounting for the difference in dilution for a fresh sample (1:5 dilution) versus a sample stored in transport media (1:2 dilution) for single or dual wavelength results. Because the TRI-COMBO PARASITE SCREEN test detects soluble antigen in fecal specimens in addition to cysts, oocysts, and trophozoites, this LoD study represents an estimate of analytical sensitivity based on purified cysts, oocysts, and whole organisms.

# e. Analytical specificity:

# g. Prozone

The purpose of this study was to ensure that a high concentration of analyte does not interfere with the performance of the TRICOMBO PARASITE SCREEN test. Five different dilutions of each analyte were prepared, starting with 2X the clinically observed high concentration. For Giardia cysts this was $\mathsf { \bar { 6 } } \mathtt { x } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ cysts/gram stool, for Cryptosporidium oocysts this was $2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ oocysts/gram stool, and for $E$ . histolytica this was $4 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ whole organisms/mL. Serial dilutions were made at a 1:2 dilution into a negative fecal pool. Testing was performed in triplicate according to the Package Insert instructions. The results below demonstrated that there was no overall hook affect, that elevated levels of analyte did not affect the detection of the analyte.

a. Clinical Sensitivity:

Prospective Study The performance of the TRI-COMBO PARASITE SCREEN test was evaluated at 3 independent sites. The performance of the TRI-COMBO PARASITE SCREEN test was compared to light microscopy, and molecular testing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for sub-speciation of E. histolytica. Molecular testing consisted of a commercial FDA cleared device and PCR with sequencing if applicable for the identification of Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp., and E. histolytica.

Prospective testing consisted of 754 specimens from two geographically distinct areas in the US and one $E$ . histolytica endemic area in Bangladesh. The three sites yield a total of 14 microscopy positive samples (13 Giardia and one $E .$ . histolytica. The remaining 740 samples were negative. Of the 740 negative samples, four were $E$ . histolytica positive by molecular comparison only but were negative by TRI-COMBO PARASITE SCREEN, negative by microcopy and negative by FDA cleared antigen test for $E .$ . histolytica. Table 1 below summarizes the performance observed, which is primarily as study to evaluate specificity due to the low number of positive specimens (See retrospective study for evaluation of sensitivity). Prospective testing was also read visually and performance was not significantly different from spectrophotometric readings.

\*The fourteen TRI-COMBO PARASITE SCREEN positives that were microscopy negative were confirmed to be positive for Giardia with an alternate FDA cleared antigen test or by PCR with sequencing.

Retrospective Study

Testing consisted of 96 archived specimens previously collected and frozen from the Bangladesh clinical site. The Frozen samples are included in the bank based on being characterized as microscopy and PCR positive. The specimens were collected form an $E .$ . histolytica endemic area and contained specimens also positives for Giardia and Cryptosporidium. Table 2 below summarizes the performance observed.

Retrospective testing was also read visually and performance was not different from spectrophotometric readings.

Note: Eight specimens were dual positive for Giardia and $E .$ . histolytica by the Microscopy and PCR and tested positive in the TRI-COMBO PARASITE SCREEN test. Three specimens were dual positive for Giardia and Cryptosporidium by Microscopy and PCR and tested positive in the TRI-COMBO PARASITE SCREEN test.

The prospective study results were analyzed by considering a composite result from multiple tests that consisted of light microscopy, molecular testing consisting of a commercial FDA cleared device and PCR with sequencing for the identification of Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp., in addition to identification and subspeciation of E. histolytica. This testing was mainly done because identification of $E$ . histolytica organisms cannot be determined solely by microscopy because it is morphologically indistinguishable from the non-pathogenic $E$ . dispar. Use of an alternate molecular testing is needed to confirm Entamoeba speciation. The molecular testing algorithm used provides a comparator method that is highly sensitive at the detection of Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp. and $E$ . histolytica. The performance is summarized in Table 3 below and is presented as positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement. The algorithm used is presented in Table 4 below.
