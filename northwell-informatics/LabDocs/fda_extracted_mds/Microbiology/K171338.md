1. Regulation section:

21 CFR 866.3215; Device to detect and measure non-microbial analyte(s) in human clinical specimens to aid in assessment of patients with suspected sepsis

2. Classification: Class II (Special Controls)

3. Product codes: PRI, PMT, NTM

4. Panel: 83 - (Microbiology)

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended Use:

The B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR® is an immunofluorescent assay using Time-Resolved Amplified Cryptate Emission (TRACE) technology to determine the concentration of PCT (procalcitonin) in human serum and EDTA or heparin plasma.

The B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR® is intended to be performed on the B·R·A·H·M·S KRYPTOR® analyzer family.

Used in conjunction with other laboratory findings and clinical assessments, B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR® is intended for use as follows:

to aid in the risk assessment of critically ill patients on their first day of ICU admission for progression to severe sepsis and septic shock, to determine the change in PCT level over time as an aid in assessing the cumulative 28-day risk of all-cause mortality for patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock in the ICU or when obtained in the emergency department or other medical wards prior to ICU admission, • to aid in decision making on antibiotic therapy, for inpatients or

patients in the emergency department with suspected or confirmed lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) – defined as communityacquired pneumonia (CAP), acute bronchitis, and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), to aid in decision making on antibiotic discontinuation for patients with suspected or confirmed sepsis.

2. Indications for use: Same as Intended Use.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only Warnings and Precautions:

• B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR® is not indicated to be used as a stand-alone diagnostic assay and should be used in conjunction with clinical signs and symptoms of infection and other diagnostic evidence.

• Decisions regarding antibiotic therapy should NOT be based solely on procalcitonin concentrations.

• PCT results should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical status of the patient and other laboratory results. Changes in PCT levels for the prediction of mortality, and overall mortality, are strongly dependent on many factors, including pre-existing patient risk factors and clinical course.

The need to continue ICU care at Day 4 and other covariates (e.g., age and SOFA score) are also significant predictors of 28-day cumulative mortality risk.

Certain patient characteristics, such as severity of renal failure or insufficiency, may influence procalcitonin values and should be considered as potentially confounding clinical factors when interpreting PCT values.

Increased PCT levels may be observed in severe illness such as polytrauma, burns, major surgery, prolonged or cardiogenic shock.

• PCT levels may not be elevated in patients infected by certain atypical pathogens, such as Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

The safety and performance of PCT-guided therapy for individuals younger than age 18 years, pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals or those on immunomodulatory agents, was not formally analyzed in the

supportive clinical trials.

# L. Test Principle:

The B·R·A·H·M·S KRYPTOR® compact PLUS analyzer is a fully automated system. The B·R·A·H·M·S KRYPTOR® compact PLUS analyzer is a closed system and can only operate utilizing special reagents provided by B·R·A·H·M·S GmbH.

The B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR® is a homogeneous sandwich immunoassay for detection of PCT in human serum or plasma. The measuring principle is based on TimeResolved Amplified Cryptate Emission $\scriptstyle ( { \mathrm { { \dot { T } } R A C E } } ^ { \circledast } )$ ) technology, which measures the signal that is emitted from an immunocomplex with time delay.

# Measuring Principle

The basis of the $\mathrm { T R A C E } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ technology is a non-radiative energy transfer from a donor [a cagelike structure with a europium ion in the center (cryptate)] to an acceptor (XL 665). The proximity of donor (cryptate) and acceptor (XL 665) in a formed immunocomplex and the spectral overlap between donor emission and acceptor absorption spectra on the one hand intensifies the fluorescent signal and on the other hand extends the life span of the acceptor signal, allowing for the measurement of temporally delayed fluorescence.

After the sample to be measured has been excited with a nitrogen laser at $3 3 7 \mathrm { n m }$ , the donor (cryptate) emits a long-life fluorescent signal in the millisecond range at $6 2 0 \mathrm { n m }$ , while the acceptor (XL 665) generates a short-life signal in the range of nanoseconds at $6 6 5 \mathrm { n m }$ . When both components are bound in an immunocomplex, both the signal amplification and the prolonged life span of the acceptor signal occur at $6 6 5 \mathrm { n m }$ , and the life is in the microsecond range. This delayed acceptor signal is proportional to the concentration of the analyte to be measured.

The specific fluorescence which is proportional to the antigen concentration is obtained through a double selection: spectral (separation depending on wave-length) and temporal (time resolved measurement). This enables an exclusive measurement of the signal emitted by the immunological complex and the ratio between the two wave-lengths (665/620) allows a real-time correction of the variations in optic transmission from the medium.

The B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR® is homogenous, and does not require separation or washing steps. It is thus possible to obtain data without interrupting the immunological reaction. High concentration samples $( > 5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / L } )$ are detected in the first few seconds of incubation and may be diluted by the appropriate dilution factor, then re-assayed automatically.

The molecules of PCT present in the assay samples are sandwiched between the antibodies;   
thus, the intensity of the signal is proportional to the amount of PCT.

The B·R·A·H·M·S KRYPTOR® compact PLUS software controls the operation of the instrument, collects and analyzes data and automatically generates a test report at the end of the run.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

# 1. Analytical performance

Most analytical performance metrics of the B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR® assay were previously established in K070310 and DEN150009, and are not affected by the additional claims. Supplementary interference studies were performed at the lower analytical cut-offs to support the new claims. These include:

Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Reagent Stability: Real-Time Shelf Life

See DEN150009. Same as predicate: Testing demonstrated that the BRAHMS PCT sensitive KRYPTOR reagents are stable for 29 days after reconstitution with solutions 1 and 2 when stored on board the B·R·A·H·M·S KRYPTOR compact PLUS analyzer.

Control (Post-Reconstitution) Stability:

See DEN150009. Same as predicate: Data demonstrated that the B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR controls are stable for up to 24 hours at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 4 hours on board, and up to one month at ${ \mathrm { < - 1 6 ^ { \circ } C } }$

Calibrators (Post-Reconstitution) Stability:

See DEN150009. Same as predicate: Data demonstrated that the B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR calibrator is stable for up to 4 hours at room temperature $( 1 8 -$ $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ .

Expected Values for Controls and Calibrators:

See DEN150009.

The B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR controls contains 2 two levels of antigen concentration, a bar code card, bar code stick-on labels. Each vial contains lyophilized recombinant PCT in defibrinated human plasma.

• B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR - Control 1 (level 1): $0 . 2 - 0 . 4 \mu \mathrm { g / L }$ • B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR - Control 2 (level 2): $8 - 1 2 \mu \mathrm { g / L }$

The bar code card contains information related to the control batch (i.e., the target concentrations), the standard deviations, and the concentration acceptance ranges.

# d. Detection Limit:

LoB and LoD determination – See DEN150009: Same as predicate.

Limit of Quantitation:

The LOQ determined as the lowest reported concentration level with bias $\leq 5 \%$ , $\% \mathrm { C V } \leq 1 5 \%$ and total error $( \mathrm { T E } ) { \leq } 3 0 \%$ was determined at $0 . 0 7 5 \mu \mathrm { g / L }$ .

The Total Error (TE) at the two proposed additional cut-offs is:

• $\mathrm { T E } \leq 2 0 \%$ at $0 . 2 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / L }$ (with a bias $\leq 5 \%$ and a precision $\mathrm { C V } \leq 1 0 \%$ ) $\mathrm { T E } \leq 3 0 \%$ at $0 . 1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / L }$ (with a bias $\leq 5 \%$ and a precision $\mathrm { C V } \leq 1 5 \%$ )

# Decision making on antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected or confirmed LRTI

Two systematic literature reviews were performed to produce both study and patient-level meta-analyses, which are studies that combine and contrast data from multiple sources to identify patterns among study results (FDA public docket FDA-2016-N-2880). The studylevel meta-analysis used aggregate descriptive information extracted from publications, and the patient-level meta-analysis used aggregate patient-level data from the raw dataset of each study. Each meta-analysis used random-effects models and calculated point estimates, differences, odds ratios (OR), interquartile ranges (IQRs) and $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals as appropriate. The endpoints evaluated were: proportion of subjects initiating antibiotics, duration of antibiotic therapy, exposure to antibiotics, length of hospital stay, mortality, and complications (patient level only).

The study-level meta-analysis encompassed 11 randomized control trials (RCTs) 6,13,15-18,30-34 which were published between 2004-2016, and included 4090 patients. The patient-level meta-analysis encompassed 13 RCTs 6,13-18,21-23, 30, 31,35 which were published between 2004-2011, and included 3142 patients as listed below.

These meta-analyses concluded that PCT guided antibiotic therapy resulted in:

• $1 9 . 2 \%$ reduction in relative antibiotic initiation for all patients   
• $3 8 \%$ reduction in overall antibiotic exposure (i.e. total days of antibiotic therapy) for inpatients   
• $51 \%$ reduction in overall antibiotic exposure (i.e. total days of antibiotic therapy) for patients who presented to the Emergency Department and other associated clinics, but were not admitted   
• 2.9 day reduction in antibiotic duration [1.25 day reduction in study-level]

• 3.6 day reduction in total antibiotic exposure [2.79 day reduction in study-level] • No negative effects in regards to mortality, complications, or length of stay

# Decision making on antibiotic discontinuation for suspected or confirmed septic patients

Two systematic literature reviews were performed along with study and patient-level metaanalyses, which are studies that combine and contrast data from multiple sources to identify patterns among study results. The study-level meta-analysis used aggregate descriptive information extracted from publications, and the patient-level meta-analysis used aggregate patient-level data from the raw dataset of each study. Each meta-analysis used randomeffects models and calculated point estimates, differences, odds ratios (OR), interquartile ranges (IQRs) and $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals as appropriate (see tables below). The endpoints evaluated were: duration of antibiotic therapy (study level only), exposure to antibiotics (patient level only), length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay (patient level only), and mortality. The study-level meta-analysis encompassed 10 RCTs 14,21-24,36-40 which were published between 2008-2016, and included 3489 patients. See FDA public docket FDA2016-N-2880.

The above patient-level meta-analysis encompassed 5 RCTs 14,21,22,37,41 which were published between 2008-2010, and included 598 patients as listed below.

\*Patients that did not classify as sepsis were removed prior to analysis (185 for PCT group and 164 for control group), leaving 598 patients

Using this subset of meta-analyses it was concluded that PCT guided antibiotic therapy resulted in:

• 1.5 day reduction in antibiotic duration   
• 3.2 day reduction in total antibiotic exposure   
• $23 \%$ reduction in overall antibiotic exposure (i.e. total days of antibiotic therapy) • No negative effects in regards to mortality, hospital length of stay, or ICU length of stay.

3. Clinical Cut-offs:

a. 28-day mortality: (Unchanged from DEN150009).

• $\Delta \mathbf { P C T } \leq 8 0 \%$

A decrease in the PCT levels below or equal to $80 \%$ defines a positive $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ test result representing a higher risk for 28-day allcause mortality of patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock.

$\Delta \mathbf { P C T } > 8 0 \%$ A decrease in the PCT levels of more than $80 \%$ defines a negative $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ test result representing a lower risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock.

# NOTE:

The combination of the first PCT level $( \leq 2 . 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { \mathfrak { r } } > 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ) at initial diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock with the patient’s clinical course and the change in PCT level over time until Day 4 provides important additional information about the mortality risk.   
The PCT level on Day 1 (the day after severe sepsis or septic shock is first clinically diagnosed) can be used to calculate the percent change in PCT level at Day 4 if the Day 0 measurement is unavailable.

b. Progression Risk :(Unchanged from K070310)

$\mathbf { P C T } > 2 \ \mathbf { \mu g / L }$   
A PCT level above $2 . 0 \mu \mathrm { g / L }$ on the first day of ICU admission is associated with a high risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.   
$\mathbf { p } \mathbf { C T } < \mathbf { 0 . 5 } ~ \mathbf { \mu g / L }$   
A PCT level below $0 . 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / L } }$ on the first day of ICU admission is associated with a low risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.

c. LRTI Antibiotic Decision Making: (K162827)

Initiation:

$\mathbf { P C T < 0 . 1 0 \mu g / L }$   
Antibiotic therapy strongly discouraged. PCT 0.10-0.25 µg/L   
Antibiotic therapy discouraged.   
PCT $\mathbf { 0 . 2 6 { - 0 . 5 0 } \mu g / L }$   
Antibiotic therapy encouraged.   
PCT ${ \bf \mathrm { > } } { \bf 0 . 5 0 } { \bf \mu } { \bf g } / { \bf L }$   
Antibiotic therapy strongly encouraged.

# Discontinuation:

$\Delta \mathrm { P C T } > 8 0 \%$   
Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued $\mathbf { P C T \leq 0 . 2 5 \mu g / L }$   
Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued

d. Sepsis Antibiotic Discontinuation: (K162827)

$\Delta \mathrm { P C T } > 8 0 \%$   
Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued $\mathbf { P C T \leq 0 . 5 0 \mu g / L }$   
Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued

4. Expected Values/Reference Range:

See DEN150009. In non-infected subjects, PCT concentrations are usually ${ < } 0 . 1 ~ \mu \varrho / \mathrm { L }$ . In a population of 132 self-reported healthy individuals, 128 tested ${ < } 0 . 1 \ \mu \mathrm { l / L }$ and the top end 95th percentile was calculated at $0 . 0 8 9 5 \ : \mu \mathrm { g / L }$
