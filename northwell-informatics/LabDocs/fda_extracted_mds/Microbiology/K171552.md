Device Name Xpert Xpress Flu

Indications for Use (Describe)

The Cepheid Xpert Xpress Flu Assay, performed on the GeneXpert Xpress System, is an automated, multiplex real-time, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) assay intended for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A and influenza B viral RNA. The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay uses nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and nasal swab (NS) specimens collected from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza infections in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.

Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2016-2017 influenza season. When other novel influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

Ancillary Collection Kit for Nasopharyngeal Swabs Indications for Use:

The Xpert Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit is designed to collect, preserve, and transport nasopharyngeal swab specimens and to preserve and transport nasal aspirate/wash specimens containing viruses from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection prior to analysis with the Xpert Flu Assay or the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay. The Xpert Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit is designed to collect, preserve, and transport nasopharyngeal swab specimens containing viruses from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection prior to analysis with the Xpert Flu $+$ RSV Xpress Assay, Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay or the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay.

Ancillary Collection Kit for Nasal Swabs Indications for Use: The Xpert Nasal Sample Collection Kit is designed to collect, preserve, and transport nasal swab specimens containing viruses from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection prior to analysis with the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay.

1) For the detection and differentiation of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV A/B viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swab specimens: Xpert® Flu+RSV Xpress Assay [510(k) #K151226]

2) For the Sample Collection Kits: Cepheid Xpert® Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit for Viruses [510(k) # K162456]

Copan Universal Transport Medium (UTM-RT) System, [510(k) # K042970]

# Device Description:

The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay is a rapid, automated in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A (Flu A) and influenza B (Flu B) viral RNA directly from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and nasal swab (NS) specimens. The assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Xpress System.

The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay includes reagents for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of the target viruses. The primers and probes in the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay detect the presence of nucleic acid sequences for Flu A and Flu B directly from NS and NP swab specimens collected from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. A Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) are internal controls utilized by the GeneXpert Xpress System platform. The SPC is present in every assay to control for adequate processing of the target viruses and to monitor for the presence of inhibitor(s) in the PCR assay to avoid false-negative results. The PCC verifies reagent rehydration, real-time PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability.

The specimens are collected in universal transport medium and transported to the GeneXpert Xpress area. The specimen is prepared according to package insert instructions and transferred to the sample chamber (large opening) of the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay cartridge. The GeneXpert cartridge is loaded onto the GeneXpert Xpress System platform, which performs hands-off automated sample processing and real-time RT-PCR for detection of Flu viral RNA. Summary and detailed test results are obtained in approximately 30 minutes or less. The results are automatically generated at the end of the process in a report that can be viewed and printed.

# Device Intended Use:

The Cepheid Xpert® Xpress Flu Assay, performed on the GeneXpert® Xpress System, is an automated, multiplex real-time, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) assay intended for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A and influenza B viral RNA. The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay uses nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and nasal swab (NS) specimens collected from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza infections in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.

Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2016-2017 influenza season. When other novel influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

Ancillary Collection Kit for Nasal Swabs Indications for Use:

The Xpert® Nasal Sample Collection Kit is designed to collect, preserve, and transport nasal swab specimens containing viruses from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection prior to analysis with the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay.

# Ancillary Collection Kit for Nasopharyngeal Swabs Indications for Use:

The Xpert® Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit is designed to collect, preserve, and transport nasopharyngeal swab specimens and to preserve and transport nasal aspirate/wash specimens containing viruses from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection prior to analysis with the Xpert Flu Assay or the Xpert Flu/RSV XC

Assay. The Xpert $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit is designed to collect, preserve, and transport nasopharyngeal swab specimens containing viruses from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection prior to analysis with the Xpert Flu $+$ RSV Xpress Assay, Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay or the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay.

# Substantial Equivalence:

The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay is substantially equivalent to the current Xpert® Flu+RSV Xpress Assay [510(k) #K151226]. The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay detects influenza A and influenza B from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and nasal swab (NS) specimens and the Xpert® Flu $^ +$ RSV Xpress Assay detects influenza A, influenza B, and RSV from NP swab specimens. Both assays utilize the same technology by determining the presence of the target organisms through real-time RT-PCR amplification and fluorogenic target-specific hybridization detection. A multi-center clinical study was conducted and data obtained using the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay was then reanalyzed with the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay Definition File (ADF). The reanalyzed data was used to determine the performance characteristics of the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay relative to the reference Flu test, which has been FDA cleared for NP swab and NS specimens. The study results showed that the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay is acceptable for its intended use and is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

The proposed collection kits and predicate collection kits have the same general intended use and the same technology to collect, store and transport clinical specimens, including

viruses, to the laboratory for further testing. The prospective component of the multi[Type here]

center clinical study of the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay was conducted using Xpert Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit for Viruses [510(k) # K162456] and Xpert Nasal Sample Collection Kit for Viruses (Copan-manufactured UTM-RT and sterile nylon flocked swab) demonstrating that the Xpert Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit for Viruses and Xpert Nasal Sample Collection Kit for Viruses are acceptable for their intended use and substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.

# Non-Clinical Studies:

# Analytical Sensitivity (Limit of Detection)

Studies were performed to determine the analytical limit of detection (LoD) of the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay with two lots of reagents across three testing days. The higher LoD observed per strain and per lot was selected for verification. Verification of the estimated LoD claim was performed on one reagent lot across a minimum of three testing days. LoD was established using two influenza A H3N2 strains, two influenza A 2009 H1N1 strains and two influenza B strains. Viruses were diluted into negative pooled NP swab and NS clinical matrices for testing. The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration (tissue culture infective dose, $\mathrm { T C I D 5 0 / m L }$ ) per sample that can be reproducibly distinguished from negative samples with $9 5 \%$ confidence or the lowest concentration at which 19 of 20 replicates were positive. Each strain was tested in replicates of 20 per concentration of virus in each matrix in NP swab and NS clinical matrix. The LoD point values for each strain tested are summarized in Tables 8-4 – 8-6.

The analytical specificity of the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay was evaluated by testing a panel of 44 cultures consisting of 16 viral, 26 bacterial, and two yeast strains representing common respiratory pathogens or those potentially encountered in the nasal passage and nasopharynx. Three replicates of all bacterial and yeast strains were tested at concentrations $\mathrm { { o f } \geq 1 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 } \ C F U / m L }$ with the exception of one strain that was tested at $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { \ C F U / m L }$ (Chlamydia pneumoniae). Three replicates of all viruses were tested at concentrations of $\geq 1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ $\mathrm { T C I D 5 0 / m L }$ . The analytical specificity was $100 \%$ . Results are shown in Table 8-7.

# Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)

The analytical reactivity of the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay was evaluated against multiple strains of influenza A H1N1 (seasonal pre-2009), influenza A pH1N1 (pandemic 2009), influenza A H3N2 (seasonal), avian influenza A (H5N1, H5N2, H6N2, H7N2, H7N3, H2N2, H7N9, and H9N2) and influenza B (representing strains from both Victoria and Yamagata lineages) at levels near the analytical LoD. A total of 48 strains comprised of 35 influenza A and 13 Influenza B strains were tested in this study with the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay. Three replicates were tested for each strain. All Flu strains tested positive in all three replicates, except for one Flu A H1N1 strain (A/New Jersey/8/76), which tested positive in 2 of 3 replicates at 0.1 TCID50/mL. Results are shown in Table 8-8.

Predicted cross reactivity from in silico analyses showed $100 \%$ sequence homology for additional pH1N1 strains.

# Potentially Interfering Substances

In a non-clinical study, potentially interfering substances that may be present in the nasal passage and nasopharynx were evaluated directly relative to the performance of the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay. Potentially interfering substances in the nasal passage and nasopharynx may include, but are not limited to: blood, nasal secretions or mucus, and nasal and throat medications used to relieve congestion, nasal dryness, irritation, or asthma and allergy symptoms, as well as antibiotics and antivirals. Negative samples (n $= 8$ ) were tested per each substance to determine the effect on the performance of the sample processing control (SPC). Positive samples $( \mathtt { n } = 8 $ ) were tested per substance with six influenza (four influenza A and two influenza B) strains spiked at 3X the analytical LoD determined for each strain. All results were compared to positive and negative simulated background matrix controls. The simulated background matrix consisted of $2 . 5 \%$ (w/v) porcine mucin, $1 \%$ (v/v) human whole blood in $0 . 8 5 \%$ sodium pe here]

chloride (NaCl) formulated in 1x PBS solution with $1 5 \%$ glycerol, which was then diluted 1:5 in UTM.

The evaluated substances are listed in Table 8-9 with active ingredients and concentrations tested shown. None of the substances caused interference of the assay at the concentrations tested in this study. All positive and negative replicates were identified correctly using the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay.

# Carry-Over Contamination

A study was conducted to demonstrate that single-use, self-contained GeneXpert cartridges prevent carry-over contamination of negative samples when followed by very high positive samples in the same GeneXpert module. The study consisted of a negative sample processed in the same GeneXpert module immediately followed by a very high influenza A sample (A/Victoria/361/2011, $2 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 7 } \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L } \mathrm { \Omega }$ ) spiked into a simulated background matrix. This testing scheme was repeated 20 times on two GeneXpert modules for a total of 41 runs resulting in 20 positive and 21 negative specimens for each virus type. All 20 positive samples were correctly reported as Flu A POSITIVE; Flu B NEGATIVE. All 21 negative samples were correctly reported as Flu A NEGATIVE; Flu B NEGATIVE.

# Competitive Interference Study

Competitive interference of the assay caused by the presence of two targets in the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay was evaluated by testing individual influenza strains near the LoD in the presence of different influenza strains at a higher concentration in a simulated background matrix. Analytical competitive interference was assessed using one (1) seasonal Flu A H3 strain (H3/Victoria/361/2011) at $0 . 8 \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ and one (1) Flu B strain (B/Mass/2/2012) at $0 . 4 5 ~ \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ ; the strains were tested in the presence of competing strains at either $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 2 } \mathrm { ~ T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ or $1 \mathrm { \Delta x \ 1 0 ^ { 3 } \ T C I D 5 0 / m L }$ . Replicates of 20 were tested for each target strain and each competitive strain combination. The normal binomial distribution with 20 replicate samples at LoD is between 17 and 20 positive results based on the binomial distribution with $\Nu { = } 2 0$ , $\mathrm { p } { = } 0 . 9 5$ (X\~Bin(20,0.95)). Therefore, sets of 20 with 16 or less positives would be rare and an indication of a competitive inhibitory effect due to high levels of a competing analyte.

With Flu A/Victoria/361/2011 at a concentration of $0 . 8 \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ no competitive inhibitory effects were observed in the presence of $1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 3 }$ $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ of Flu B/Mass/2/2012.  With Flu B/Mass/2/2012 at a concentration of $0 . 4 5 ~ \mathrm { T C I D } { \scriptstyle 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ competitive inhibitory effects were observed in the presence of $\mathrm { 1 x 1 0 ^ { 3 } ~ T C I D 5 0 / m L }$ of Flu

A/Victoria/361/2011. No competitive inhibitory effects were observed in the presence of $1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 2 }$ T $\mathrm { C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ of Flu A/Victoria/361/2011.

Under the conditions of this study, internal competitive inhibitory effects were observed on the Flu B target in the presence of Flu A for the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay. The competitive inhibitory effect on the Xpert Xpress Flu targets is addressed in the Limitations section of the Package Insert.

# Clinical Studies

# Clinical Comparison Study

Performance characteristics of the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay were evaluated at fourteen institutions in the U.S. during the 2016-2017 influenza season.

Specimens were collected from the following:

Individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of respiratory infection who provided informed consent for the collection of a NS or NP swab specimen.

The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay performance was compared to FDA-cleared molecular comparator assay.

# Overall Results

A total of 3229 specimens (1582 NS and 1647 NP swab) were tested for influenza A and influenza B by the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay and the comparator assay.

For NS specimens, the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay demonstrated a positive percent agreement (PPA) and a negative percent agreement (NPA) relative to the comparator method of $9 8 . 9 \%$ and $9 7 . 3 \%$ for the detection of influenza A and $9 8 . 4 \%$ and $9 9 . 2 \%$ for influenza B, respectively (Table 8-10).

For NP swab specimens, the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay demonstrated a PPA and NPA relative to the comparator method of $9 7 . 5 \%$ and $9 8 . 0 \%$ for the detection of influenza A and $9 7 . 3 \%$ and $9 9 . 5 \%$ for influenza B, respectively (Table 8-10).

For the combined dataset, the Xpert X press Flu Assay demonstrated a PPA and NPA relative to the comparator method of $9 8 . 2 \%$ and $9 7 . 7 \%$ for the detection of influenza A and $9 7 . 8 \%$ and $9 9 . 4 \%$ for influenza B, respectively (Table 8-10).

Of the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay runs performed with eligible specimens, $9 8 . 1 \%$ (3175/3236) of these specimens were successful on the first attempt. The remaining 61 gave indeterminate results on the first attempt $3 3 \mathrm { N O }$ RESULT-REPEAT TEST results and 28 INSTRUMENT ERROR). Fifty-nine of the 61 indeterminate cases were retested, of which 54 yielded valid results upon repeat testing; two specimens were not retested. The overall rate of assay success was $9 9 . 8 \%$ (3229/3236). The overall indeterminate rate was $0 . 2 \%$ .

# Reproducibility Study

Reproducibility was established in a multi-center, blinded study using a 5-member specimen panel. Testing was performed at three sites using the GeneXpert Xpress System.

[Type here]

Testing was conducted for five (not necessarily consecutive) days, with one lot of Xpert Xpress Flu cartridges. Each site had three operators, who tested each panel twice each day. Results are summarized in Table 8-11.
