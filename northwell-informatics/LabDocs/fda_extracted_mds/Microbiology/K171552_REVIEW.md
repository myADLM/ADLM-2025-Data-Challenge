Device Intended Use:

The Cepheid Xpert® Xpress Flu Assay, performed on the GeneXpert® Xpress System, is an automated, multiplex real-time, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) assay intended for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A and influenza B viral RNA. The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay uses nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and nasal swab (NS) specimens collected from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The Xpert Xpress Flu Assay is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza infections in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.

Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2016-2017 influenza season. When other novel influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

Ancillary Collection Kit for Nasal Swabs Indications for Use:

The Xpert® Nasal Sample Collection Kit is designed to collect, preserve, and transport nasal swab specimens containing viruses from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection prior to analysis with the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay.

Ancillary Collection Kit for Nasopharyngeal Swabs Indications for Use:

The Xpert® Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit is designed to collect, preserve, and transport nasopharyngeal swab specimens and to preserve and transport nasal aspirate/wash specimens containing viruses from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection prior to analysis with the Xpert Flu Assay or the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay. The Xpert $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit is designed to collect, preserve, and transport nasopharyngeal swab specimens containing viruses from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection prior to analysis with the Xpert Flu $+$ RSV Xpress Assay, Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay or the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay.

Same as Intended Use

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For Prescription Use Only

4. Special instrument requirements: Gene Xpert Xpress System

# I. Device Description:

This assay uses nasopharyngeal swab specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. Viral nucleic acid is extracted from the sample and the influenza A and/or influenza B viral RNA is amplified and detected through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Detection and differentiation of influenza A and influenza B is reported to the user.

The assay uses single use disposable cartridge that has a separate section for specimen loading. The cartridge also contains all PCR reagents and is where the PCR reaction takes place. The GeneXpert Xpress System performs all assay steps from clinical sample to reporting assay results automatically. A Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) are also included in the cartridge. The SPC is present to control for adequate processing of the target viruses and to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the PCR reaction. The Probe Check Control (PCC) verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability.

The GeneXpert Xpress System, comprised of the GeneXpert Dx System GX-II, which has two modules capable of performing separate sample preparation and real-time PCR and RTPCR tests, and the GX-IV which has four modules. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids (i.e., the syringe drive activates the plunger that works in concert with the rotary valve in the cartridge to move fluids between chambers), an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells, and a proprietary thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and RT-PCR and detection.

Turnaround time for analysis of a sample is approximately 30 minutes or less. The assay results are automatically generated at the end of the process and provided in a report that can be viewed and printed.

All negative samples produced a negative result (90/90).

All moderate positive samples produced a positive result [Flu A (90/90) and Flu B (90/90)].

The low positive samples were prepared to target a concentration close the limit of detection (LoD) for both sample types. However, this resulted in the low positive samples having a titer lower than the LoD for the NP swab matrix. Overall, $9 1 . 0 \%$ (81/89) of the Flu A low positive samples and $9 3 . 3 \%$ (84/90) of the Flu B low positive samples were classified as positive for the corresponding target. Based on the virus titer used and the LoD for the different sample types, the $91 \%$ and $93 \%$ positive results for the low positive samples are acceptable.

# d. Detection limit:

Studies were performed to determine the analytical limit of detection (LoD) of the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay with two lots of reagents across three testing days. The higher LoD observed per strain and per lot was selected for verification. Verification of the estimated LoD claim was performed on one reagent lot across a minimum of three testing days. LoD was established using two influenza A H3N2 strains, two influenza A 2009 H1N1 strains, and two influenza B strains. Viruses were diluted into negative pooled NP swab and NS clinical matrices for testing. The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration (tissue culture infective dose, $\mathrm { T C I D 5 0 / m L }$ ) per sample that can be reproducibly distinguished from negative samples $9 5 \%$ of the times or the lowest concentration at which 19 of 20 replicates were positive. Each strain was tested in replicates of 20 per concentration of virus in each matrix, in NP swab and NS clinical matrix. The LoD point values for each strain tested are summarized in Table below.

b. Matrix comparison:   
Equivalency study for NP swab clinical matrix and simulated matrix was described in K162456. This study was repeated for the NS clinical matrix to show equivalency between the nasal swab specimen and simulated matrix.

Simulated matrix consisted of $2 . 5 \%$ (w/v) porcine mucin, $1 \% ( \mathrm { v / v } )$ human whole blood in $0 . 8 5 \%$ sodium chloride (NaCl) formulated in 1x PBS solution with $1 5 \%$ glycerol, which was then diluted in UTM to a final concentration of $1 6 . 7 \%$ . The NS clinical matrix was created by pooling negative NS clinical matrix, then aliquoting the pooled matrix and spiking it with the appropriate virus. This study was performed by spiking the NS clinical matrix and simulated matrix with influenza strains at four different concentrations relative to the assay LoD: low positives (2X LoD), medium positives (5X LoD), and high positives (10X and 100X LoD).

# Clinical Studies

A total of 3610 patients were enrolled in this clinical study, 29 patient specimens were ineligible for inclusion because of improper consent documents, previously enrolled subjects and subjects deemed ineligible by the institutional review board (not an institution of employee). Of the 3576 eligible specimens there were 1784 nasal swabs (NS) and 1792 nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs. Each patient provided either an NS specimen or NP swab specimen. For nasal swab specimens one swab was used to swab both nostrils, only one nostril was swabbed for the NP swab specimen. Specimens were prospectively collected fresh and tested as soon as possible after collection and within 24 hours.

A total of 304 samples were excluded for the following reasons; 235 unresolved comparator result, 6 invalid comparator assay controls, 17 specimen frozen, 14 shipping problem 9 incorrect specimen collection, 8 not tested with GX system, 4 run on incorrect assay, and 4 not tested within protocol specified time period.

There were 3279 eligible specimens evaluated which resulted in 61 indeterminate results (33NO RESULT and 28 INSTRUMENT ERROR), 59 of those were re-tested to yield 54 valid results from repeat testing. The final indeterminate rate was $0 . 2 \%$ .

The total number of eligible samples with valid results was 3272; $54 . 8 \%$ from female subjects and $4 5 . 2 \%$ from male subjects. The table below shows the distribution of patients by age group and the number of posititves for Flu A and Flu B.

The instrument systems each contain a computer and preloaded software for running tests and viewing the results.

# 3. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types.

Yes _X _ or No

Moderate

5. Software Description

The GeneXpert Instrument Systems are provided with a computer, preloaded with software for running tests and viewing results. Each instrument (Dx and Infinity) contains random access, closed-system, computer-based software and embedded firmware which run dedicated microprocessor-controlled modules to integrate sample preparation, amplification and real-time detection in a single system.

The GeneXpert Infinity modules contain extra robotic features for cartridge handling. The Xpertise software utilized by the Infinity Systems is the user interface and provides the ordering of tests as well as automates loading and unloading of cartridges into GeneXpert modules within the system. The Xpertise user interface builds upon the existing core software functionality for handling GeneXpert modules for cartridge fluidics control, temperature control, optics control, and data analysis by the addition of automation handling for the robotic arm.

# 6. Specimen Identification

Specimens are manually loaded into the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay cartridge by the user. The user can then either scan or type the sample and patient ID into the system. Prior to placing the cartridge into the GeneXpert Instrument System, the barcode on the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay cartridge is scanned. The information contained in the assay barcode is utilized by the software to run the appropriate assay definition file (ADF). If an assay is being run that does not already exist in the GeneXpert database, the user must import the ADF before starting the test.

7. Calibration

Not required.

8. Quality Control

# Sample Processing Control

The sample processing control (SPC) is a non-infectious armored RNA pseudovirus that is included in each cartridge to verify that adequate processing of the sample has occurred. The SPC verifies that nucleic acids have been released from the target viruses if the organism is present and detects specimen-associated PCR and RT-PCR inhibitors. The SPC should be POSITIVE in a sample that is negative for influenza A and influenza B target analytes, and can be NEGATIVE or POSITIVE in a sample containing detectable levels of one or both of the target analytes.

# Probe Check Control

Before the start of the amplification process, the GeneXpert Instrument Systems measures the fluorescence signal from the probes to monitor bead rehydration, reaction tube filling, probe integrity, and dye stability. All assay reagents must be present and intact for the PCC to pass the validated acceptance criteria. If any of the PCC conditions fail, the result is reported as an ERROR and the test must be repeated using a new assay cartridge.
