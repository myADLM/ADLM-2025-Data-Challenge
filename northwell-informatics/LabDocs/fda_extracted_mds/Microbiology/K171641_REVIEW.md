# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The Accula Flu A/Flu B Test performed on the Accula Dock is a molecular in vitro diagnostic test utilizing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and lateral flow technologies for the qualitative, visual detection and differentiation of influenza A and influenza B viral RNA. The Accula Flu A/Flu B Test uses a nasal swab specimen collected from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The Accula Flu A/Flu B assay is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza infection in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. The assay is not intended to detect the presence of influenza C virus.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.

Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2016-2017 influenza season. When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local public health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $3 +$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

2. Indication(s) for use: Same as Intended Use.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For Prescription Use

4. Special instrument requirements: To be used only with the Accula Dock Instrument

# I. Device Description:

The Accula Flu A/Flu B Test is a semi-automated, colorimetric, multiplex reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nucleic acid amplification test to qualitatively detect influenza A and B viral RNA from unprocessed nasal swabs that have not undergone prior nucleic acid extraction. The system integrates nucleic acid extraction, reverse transcription, amplification using a novel Mesa Biotech technology, and hybridization-based visual detection into a completely self-contained and automated system. The Accula Flu A/Flu B system consists of a small reusable Dock to drive the automated testing process and a single-use disposable test cassette that contains all the enzymes and reagents.

Upon insertion of a Test Cassette, the Dock will detect and identify the cassette type. After the user transfers a clinical sample into the cassette and closes the dock lid, the embedded firmware will control fluid flow of the sample into the various chambers of the cassette.

Amplicon detection requires the hybridization of two internal probes to generate a signal on the Accula Flu A/Flu B detection strip. Dyed polystyrene microspheres are conjugated to oligonucleotide probes to form an amplicon-microsphere complex by hybridization to an internal region of the amplicon. The complex migrates through the pores of the detection strip membrane and across capture zones which contain oligonucleotides complementary to an amplicon region distinct from the detection probe binding site. Hybridization of the amplicon-microsphere complex to a capture zone probe retards the flow of the specific amplicon and results in the generation of a visible signal in the form of a colored line.

# Interpretation of results:

Results are interpreted visually by the operator after the test has completed. A colored line of any intensity at the “Flu A” and/or “Flu $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { B } } ^ { \flat }$ location indicates a positive result for that influenza virus type if the test is valid. A Negative Control line at the end of the test strip controls for non-specific binding or amplification and must be absent for a valid test. A control line at the beginning of the strip displays amplification effectiveness and is necessary to interpret a test as “negative” for influenza A and influenza B.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The reproducibility of the Accula Flu A/Flu B Test was tested in a study using contrived nasal swabs at three CLIA-waived sites and one moderately complex site based in the United States. The objective of this study was to test panels of contrived nasal swab samples with the Accula Flu A/Flu B Test to demonstrate reproducibility of the assay in the hands of multiple users at multiple sites over multiple nonconsecutive days.

Samples were provided to testing operators in panels of 5 samples (Flu A Low Positive and Moderate Positive, Flu B Low Positive and Moderate Positive, and Negative). The targeted concentrations for the Moderate Positive samples were approximately 3X the respective LoD, the targeted concentrations for the Low Positive samples were approximately 1X the respective LoD, and the Negative samples contained no influenza virus. Samples were blinded and randomized. Each operator tested one panel per day, testing a maximum of five samples at a time. Each sample was tested in triplicate (from separate swabs) (2 operators x 1 run x 3 swabs x 5 non-consecutive days $= 3 0$ observations for each site per sample type). Results are reported for counts and percent agreement with expected results. Results were evaluated by site, by operator and by day.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable; this is a qualitative assay.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Quality Control:

Each test cassette contains two internal process controls: an internal positive control and a negative control. The positive control is a non-infectious RNA molecule of the MS2 bacteriophage. The negative control is a non-influenza nucleic acid target intended to check for non-specific binding. Each test kit also contains separate control swabs with inactivated virus for influenza A or influenza B. The manufacturer recommends positive controls be run for each new lot or shipment of kits received, and for each new operator performing the test. Additional positive control swabs are available for purchase from the manufacturer.

# Specimen Stability

Contrived samples of Influenza A (A/CA/07/2009; 300 $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ ) and Influenza B (B/Massachusetts/02/2012; 400 $\mathsf { \Pi } ^ { \mathrm { 1 T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L } }$ ) were tested in triplicate on the Accula Flu A/Flu B assay. Samples were prepared in pooled negative matrix containing the Accula Flu A/Flu B nasal swab buffer solution and stored at various conditions. For freeze/thaw cycles, samples were frozen for at least 3 hours before thaw. Test

conditions and the results of the testing are summarized in the table below:

\* Initial testing resulted in 2 out of 3 positive for Flu A. New samples were prepared and tested 3/3 positive for Flu A.

Mesa Biotech has indicated that specimens should be transferred to the nasal swab buffer sample tube immediately after collection and stored for no longer than one hour at room temperature.

# Shelf Life

Accula Flu A/Flu B test kits are being tested for shelf life by storage at $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for different lengths of time. At each time interval (day 0, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 1 month intervals beyond) stored test kits are used to test control swabs and simulated influenza A and influenza B samples prepared in clinical matrix. Contrived specimens are prepared in clinical matrix at approximately 3X LoD. Negative samples and control swabs are tested as one replicate. Acceptance criteria for shelf life studies are as follows: all positive samples and controls must yield a $100 \%$ positive rate and all negative samples and controls must yield a $100 \%$ negative rate. Tests were

considered stable as long as they continued to produce positive results for positive samples and negative results for negative samples. Data generated so far demonstrates that two lots are stable for three months and a third lot is stable for at least two months. Kit storage conditions for the Accula Flu A/Flu B test are being labeled as stable at $1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for at least two months. Expiration dating will be extended as the study continues provided that correct results are obtained for all three test lots during the testing period.

# d. Detection limit:

The objective of the Analytical Sensitivity Study was to identify the limit of detection (LoD) of the Accula Flu A/Flu B assay using characterized strains of Influenza A and Influenza B. Four (4) influenza strains were run in replicates of twenty (20) for each concentration. The influenza strains selected for testing included a 2009-like seasonal H1N1 influenza A strain, an H3N2 influenza A strain, and two influenza B strains representing Victoria and Yamagata lineages. Clinical matrix was used as dilution material for all LoD determination/confirmation experiments.

To determine the limit of detection, a range-finding study was first conducted to establish the lower limit of analytical sensitivity using virus dilutions tested in replicates of $\mathrm { n } { = } 5$ . Following identification of the lower end of the detectable concentrations in the range finding study, virus concentrations ranging from 1.3-fold to 2-fold more concentrated were prepared for each virus based on experimental design and viral stock available. Virus concentration was increased until at least 19/20 independent positives were found reproducibly (i.e., in two similar confirmations) during testing. The final concentrations whereby at least $9 5 \%$ of results $( \geq 1 9 / 2 0 )$ ) were positive for the target virus are shown in the table below:

# e. Analytical reactivity:

Inclusivity verification was evaluated for the Accula Flu A/Flu B test using 23 influenza strains. The chosen strains represented subtypes in the population, including A: H1N1, A: H3N2, A: H1N1 (2009), B Victoria lineage strains, and B Yamagata lineage strains. Virus was diluted into a pooled clinical matrix to create contrived samples at a 1.5X LOD concentration. Each strain was tested in triplicate.

# g. Interfering Substances:

To assess substances with the potential to interfere with the performance of the Accula Flu A/ Flu B test, four (4) influenza strains were tested in replicates of three (3) with each interfering substance at the “worst case” concentration. The influenza strains selected for testing include a 2009 pandemic swine-like H1N1 influenza A strain, an H3N2 influenza A strain, and two influenza B strains representing Victoria and Yamagata lineages. Virus was serially diluted into a pooled clinical matrix to achieve a 1.5X LoD concentration.

Each influenza strain was tested with the “worst case” interferent concentration, representing the highest concentration likely to be found in a respiratory sample.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable. Performance of the Accula Flu A/Flu B Test was evaluated against the comparator method in a prospective clinical study.

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable.

Clinical performance was evaluated in a multi-site study in the U.S. during the 2016- 2017 influenza season. Accula Flu A/Flu B was used to evaluate fresh, prospectively collected nasal swab specimens from children and adults with suspected respiratory infection and meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Samples were tested with the Accula Flu A/Flu B within one hour of sample collection. At all sites, one swab specimen was tested directly on the Accula Flu A/Flu B according to product instructions. The other swab was eluted in VTM and shipped to a reference laboratory for testing with a high performance, FDA-cleared molecular influenza assay. Elution and shipping of the reference swab sample was performed according to the kit instructions.

A total of 1331 nasal swab specimens were enrolled in the study. Of those, 73 specimens were unevaluable: four did not meet eligibility criteria, 53 samples were rejected due to protocol deviations, and 16 samples returned invalid results after repeat testing. A total of 1258 nasal swab specimens were considered evaluable. Patient age and gender distribution for the evaluable specimens is presented in the table below:

During the prospective clinical study, the initial invalid rate for nasal swab samples (before repeat testing per the product instructions) was $9 . 1 \%$ (116/1272). After repeat testing per the product instructions, the invalid rate was $1 . 1 \%$ (14/1272). Performance of the Accula Flu A/Flu B assay compared to an FDA-cleared molecular assay for nasal swab samples is presented below.
