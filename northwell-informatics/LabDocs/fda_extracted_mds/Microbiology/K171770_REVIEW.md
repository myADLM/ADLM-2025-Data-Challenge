# L. Test Principle:

The cobas Liat Cdiff test uses silica magnetic particle-based nucleic acid extraction and TaqMan probe-based real-time PCR amplification and detection. The cobas Liat Analyzer automates and integrates sample purification, nucleic acid amplification and detection of the target sequence in biological samples. Other than adding the sample to the cobas Cdiff assay tube, no reagent preparation or additional steps are required. The cobas Liat System consists of a cobas Liat Analyzer with integrated software for running tests and analyzing the results, and a single-use disposable cobas Cdiff assay tube that holds all of the sample purification and PCR reagents and hosts the sample preparation and PCR processes specific for the Cdiff analyte. The test uses the assay tube as both the sample and reaction vessel. The assay tube comprises flexible tubing containing all required unit dose reagents pre-packed in tube segments, separated by pressure-sensitive seals, in the order of reagent use.

During the testing process, multiple sample processing actuators of the analyzer compress the cobas Cdiff assay tube to selectively release reagents from tube segments, move the sample from one segment to another, and control reaction conditions such as reaction volume, temperature, pressure, and incubation time. Precise control of all these parameters provides optimal conditions for assay reactions, allowing the test to achieve high performance similar to or better than that of currently available molecular assays. The cobas Liat Analyzer software controls and coordinates these actions to perform all required assay processes, including sample preparation, nucleic acid extraction, target enrichment, inhibitor removal, nucleic acid elution, and real-time PCR. All assay steps are performed within the closed and self-contained cobas Cdiff assay tube, thereby eliminating the potential for crosscontamination between samples. The collected data are automatically analyzed and the result is displayed in the assay report on the integrated LCD touch screen of the cobas Liat Analyzer.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

# Reproducibility

The reproducibility of the cobas Liat Cdiff test was established in a multi-site investigation (two external sites and one internal site) using simulated clinical samples evaluated across reagent lot, site, operator, and testing day. Overall, 818 tests were performed in this study, out of which 798 were valid for the study. Only those valid results were included in the final percent agreement analysis.

Panels consisted of three members: one negative specimen and two specimens with different concentrations of one strain of toxigenic C. difficile: a low positive concentration near the limit of detection $[ \mathord { \sim } 1 \mathrm { X }$ LOD), and a moderate positive concentration ${ } _ { \sim 3 \mathrm { X } }$ LOD). A run was defined as testing of three replicates of a panel member. For each of three lots, panels were run on five different nonconsecutive days by two different operators at each of the three sites.

Table 1 shows the percent agreement to expected results by panel member. Results were in agreement when a positive panel member had a valid result of Positive (Cdiff Detected) for the analyte or when the negative panel member had a valid result of Negative (Cdiff Not Detected) for the analyte. For the ${ \sim } 1 \mathrm { X }$ LOD panel members, the overall percent agreement was $9 8 . 5 \%$ with a lower bound of the two-sided $9 5 \%$ Score CI of $9 6 . 2 \%$ . Overall percent agreement was $9 9 . 3 \%$ for the ${ \sim } 3 \mathrm { X }$ LOD panel member and $100 \%$ for the negative panel member.

Table 2 below presents the overall standard deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of variation $( \% C V )$ of cycle threshold $\mathrm { ( C t ) }$ values for positive panel members at ${ \sim } 1 \mathrm { X }$ LOD and ${ \sim } 3 \mathrm { X }$ LOD concentrations, as well as the variance attributed to individual components (lot, site, operator, testing day, and within-run). Within-run variation refers to the variation within a ‘study run’ that consists of the three replicates for a given panel member processed by the same operator on the same analyzer on the same day.

Across all components, the total $\% \mathrm { C V } \mathrm { w a s } \leq 1 . 9 \%$ with respect to the Ct value for all positive panel members. Within each component, the $\%$ CV was $\leq 1 . 6 \%$ across positive panel members.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Internal Control

A whole organism Internal Control is included in the assay tube and automatically added to all samples at the start of sample preparation. The cobas Liat Cdiff Internal Control is a chemically-inactivated bacterium $( B t i )$ that is included in each cobas Cdiff assay tube and processed along with each sample. The Internal Control checks for adequate processing of the target bacteria through all steps of the assay and monitors the presence of inhibitors in the sample preparation and PCR. The cobas Liat Cdiff Internal Control should be positive in a negative sample and can be negative or positive in a Cdiff positive sample.

C. difficile External Positive and Negative Controls Positive Control

The cobas Liat Cdiff Positive Control contains non-infectious DNA plasmids with $C .$ . difficile target sequence. The cobas Liat Cdiff Positive Control verifies the integrity of reagents in the cobas Cdiff assay tube and proper function of the cobas Liat Analyzer.

Negative Control

The cobas Liat Negative Control contains no target and monitors potential target contamination in the workflow or environment.

One cobas Liat Cdiff Positive Control and one cobas Liat Negative Control are run during the “Add Lot” procedure described earlier. Valid results must be obtained for both the Positive and Negative Control for the new lot of cobas Cdiff assay tubes to be validated on the instrument. Additional control runs may be performed after the “Add Lot” procedure in accordance with local, state, federal and/or accrediting organization requirements.

Across all sites during the clinical study, a total of 387 QC external control batches (including both positive and negative controls) were run. Of these QC batches, 376 $( 9 7 . 2 \% )$ were valid, two $( 0 . 5 \% )$ failed due to hardware issues, and nine $( 2 . 3 \% )$ were invalid due to reagent or protocol issues.

# Sample stability

Unformed stool sample stability was demonstrated by testing $C .$ . difficile positive and negative clinical specimens on the cobas Liat Cdiff test after storage at 15 or $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for two days, and also after storage at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for an additional seven days. The study also evaluated the stability of stool samples re-suspended in cobas PCR media. The results supported the labeled claims of unformed stool sample stability at $2 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for two days, at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for nine days, and the stability of stool sample resuspended in cobas PCR media for seven days at $2 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Analytical sensitivity

The Limit of Detection (LoD) for the cobas Liat Cdiff test was determined by analyzing quantified $C .$ . difficile cultures diluted to multiple concentration levels in negative stool matrix. Two toxigenic C. difficile strains were tested: ATCC 43255(VPI 10463) and R12087 (CDI 196). Negative stool matrix samples were also run to verify the Limit of Blank (LoB). All $C .$ . difficile concentrations were tested in three replicates each using two unique lots of cobas Cdiff assay tubes. The lowest level with $100 \%$ hit rate was tested with additional replicates to confirm the LOD level. If the overall hit rate for that level was less than $9 5 \%$ , the panel level above was tested with additional replicates. The final LOD level was confirmed with at least 21 additional replicates. LOD for this test is defined as the target concentration which can be detected as positive $\mathrm { i n } \geq 9 5 \%$ of the replicates tested, based on results generated by the worst performing reagent lot. The results are shown in Table 3.

# Inclusivity

The inclusivity of the cobas Liat Cdiff test was evaluated on 37 toxigenic strains representing additional toxinotypes. Three replicates per strain were tested at three times the LOD level $( { \sim } 6 0 \mathrm { C F U / m l }$ equivalent to 270 CFU/swab) as determined for ATCC 43255. At this inoculum level, all 37 toxigenic strains were detected. The tested strains are listed in Table 4.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Cross reactivity/ Microbial interference To assess the analytical specificity of the cobas Liat Cdiff test, a panel was tested that included 117 bacteria, fungi and viruses that may be found in stool specimens, one type of human cell, and 29 Clostridium genus organisms, including non-toxigenic $C$ difficile (Table 5 and Table 6). No wet testing was conducted for Clostridium botulinum; analytical specificity for this organism was predicted using BLAST program analysis against the GenBank nucleotide sequence database to mimic PCR amplicon generation.

All bacteria and human cells were spiked to $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { U n i t s / m L }$ , and all viruses were spiked to $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ Units/mL equivalent in stool matrix. Bacteria were quantified in colony forming units $\mathrm { ( C F U ) / m L }$ , human cells were quantified in cells $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { ~ m L ~ } }$ , and viruses were quantified in $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ , except for Chlamydia trachomatis, which was quantified in $\mathrm { I F U / m L }$ .

The organisms were tested alone or in the presence of two toxigenic C. difficile isolates spiked at 3X LOD of the cobas Liat Cdiff test. Results indicated that none of the test organisms interfered with detection of intended toxigenic C. difficile targets. None of the test organisms produced false positive results in the absence of toxigenic C. difficile.

# Interference

Thirty eight commonly used medications, as well as fecal fat, whole blood, and mucin, were tested for potential interference effects with the cobas Liat Cdiff test. All substances were tested at levels above what could be reasonably expected to be collected by a swab in a stool specimen. The amount of interference substance is expressed as the concentration spiked in the primary stool specimen in Table 8. Two C. difficile isolates were spiked to 3X LOD of the cobas Liat Cdiff test and used as

targets in the tests.

Exogenous substances at the highest tolerable concentration with no interference on cobas Liat Cdiff test are shown in Table 8. Exogenous substances concentrations higher than listed in Table 8 may generate false negative or invalid results. For fecal fat, no interference was observed up to $3 9 \%$ (w/v), and for mucin no interference was observed up to $5 0 \% \mathrm { ( w / v ) }$ . For whole blood, no interference was observed up to $100 \%$ (v/v), which is equivalent to $100 \%$ capacity of the transfer swab.

# Specimens containing these substances at higher concentrations may generate invalid results. \* Specimens containing these substances at higher concentrations may generate false negative results.

f. Assay cut-off:

Data from pre-clinical testing of stool specimens were compiled and analyzed to verify the preliminary cut-off value. The cut-off was validated in the prospective clinical study which demonstrated an adequate separation of the negative and positive sample results in the study.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity:

The clinical performance of the cobas Liat Cdiff test was established in a prospective, multi-site investigation in comparison to the combined results of direct and broth enriched toxigenic culture using leftover, de-identified, unformed stool samples from patients suspected of having C. difficile infection.

Nine study sites from geographically diverse locations participated in this study. Nineteen operators distributed across these study sites performed testing with the cobas Liat Cdiff test. Reference culture was performed at a reference laboratory. Discrepant analysis testing was conducted using an FDA-cleared comparator NAAT.

A total of 1188 fresh remnant specimens were prospectively collected from symptomatic patients suspected of CDI. Of these, 172 were excluded according to the criteria for enrollment, storage, or cobas Liat Cdiff test processing as defined in the protocol. Of the 1,016 specimens tested with the cobas Liat Cdiff test, $1 . 4 \%$

(14/1016) were initially invalid and $0 . 2 \%$ (2/1016) initially had failed results. After one retest per invalid or failed result following the labeled instructions, the final invalid rate was $0 . 1 \%$ (1/1016) and the final failed rate was $0 \%$ (0/1016). The three repeat invalid test results were excluded from the final performance analysis.

A total of 1,013 evaluable specimens were included in the study from 483 males $( 4 7 . 7 \% )$ and 530 females $( 5 2 . 3 \% )$ with a median age of 59 years (range 5 to 98). All 1,013 specimens had valid results for both combined direct and enrichment culture and the cobas Liat Cdiff test. Of the 1,013 specimens, 179 were positive for toxigenic C. difficile using the combined results from direct and enrichment toxigenic culture, for a prevalence of $1 7 . 7 \%$ for the study.

Comparison with Combined Direct and Broth Enrichment Culture The clinical performance of the cobas Liat Cdiff test compared with the combined results of direct and enrichment toxigenic culture are shown in Table 9. The sensitivity and specificity of the cobas Liat Cdiff test were $8 7 . 2 \%$ (156/179; $9 5 \%$ CI: $8 1 . 5 \%$ to $9 1 . 3 \%$ ) and $9 8 . 1 \%$ (818/834; $9 5 \%$ CI: $9 6 . 9 \%$ to $9 8 . 8 \%$ ), respectively; and the PPV and NPV were $9 0 . 7 \%$ $9 5 \%$ CI: $8 5 . 4 \%$ to $9 4 . 2 \%$ ) and $9 7 . 3 \%$ $9 5 \%$ CI: $9 5 . 9 \%$ to $9 8 . 2 \%$ ), respectively. Of the 23 specimens with false-negative cobas Liat Cdiff test results relative to combined direct culture and enrichment culture, 19 were negative, three were positive and one was invalid by an FDA-cleared NAAT for tcdB DNA. Of the 16 specimens with false-positive cobas Liat Cdiff test results relative to combined direct and enrichment culture, 14 were positive and two were negative by the FDA-cleared NAAT.

Comparison with Direct Culture

The performance of the cobas Liat Cdiff test compared to direct culture is shown in Table. The positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) of the cobas Liat Cdiff test compared to the direct culture for all 1,013 specimens were $9 4 . 6 \%$ (139/147) and $9 6 . 2 \%$ (833/866), respectively. Of the eight specimens with false-negative cobas Liat Cdiff test results relative to direct culture, seven were negative and one was positive by a second NAAT method. Of the 33 specimens with false-positive cobas Liat Cdiff test results relative to direct culture, only 17 were tested with the second NAAT method: 14 were positive and three were negative by that second NAAT method. The remaining 16/33 specimens were positive by enriched culture and hence not tested with the second NAAT method per the discrepant analysis protocol.

3. Specimen Identification:

A sample barcode is scanned or a sample ID entered into the cobas Liat System during the assay run process. After scanning the sample barcode, the corresponding sample is loaded directly into a cobas Liat Tube using a transfer pipette. After the tube is capped, the tube barcodes is scanned by the cobas Liat System and the tube is inserted into the system to start the test.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Specimen sampling and handling during the assay is controlled automatically using multiple sample processing modules contained within the cobas Liat System. The sample processing modules are composed of two assemblies, a moving side assembly comprised of multiple sample processing plungers and clamps and a fixed side assembly. When performing an assay, a cobas Liat Tube is inserted into the tube slot of a cobas Liat System. The plungers and clamps selectively compress the cobas Liat Tube segments against the fixed side assembly to release reagents from the segments, move the sample from one segment to another, and control reaction conditions.
