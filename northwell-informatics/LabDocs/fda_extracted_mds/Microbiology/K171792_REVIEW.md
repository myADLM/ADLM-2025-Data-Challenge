4. Panel: Microbiology (83)

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The Alere i Influenza A & B 2 assay performed on the Alere i Instrument is a rapid molecular in vitro diagnostic test utilizing an isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology for the qualitative detection and discrimination of influenza A and B viral RNA in direct nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs and nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs eluted in viral transport media from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. It is intended for use as an aid in the differential diagnosis of influenza A and B viral infections in humans in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. The assay is not intended to detect the presence of influenza C virus.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other patient management decisions.

Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2016-2017 influenza season when influenza A/H3 and A/H1N1 pandemic were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

2. Indication(s) for use: Same as Intended Use

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For Prescription Use

4. Special instrument requirements: To be used only with the Alere i Instrument

# I. Device Description:

The Alere i Influenza A & B 2 assay consists of a single-use Sample Receiver containing the elution buffer, a single-use Test Base comprising two sealed reaction tubes, each containing a lyophilized pellet, disposable Transfer Cartridge for transfer of the eluted sample to the Test Base, the Alere i Instrument to process the sample and to record raw data, and embedded software to analyze and interpret the data. The test also includes Alere i Influenza A&B positive and negative external control swabs for quality control purposes. The controls are also available separately as an accessory item. The Alere Universal Printer and Barcode Scanner are also available as accessories.

To perform the assay, the Sample Receiver and the Test Base are inserted into the Alere i Instrument and the elution buffer is automatically heated by the instrument. The sample is added to the Sample Receiver and transferred via the Transfer Cartridge to the Test Base. Resuspending the lyophilized pellet contained within the Test Base initiates the target amplification. Heating, mixing, and detection by fluorescence are provided by the instrument, with results automatically reported.

The test performs individual amplification reactions for influenza A and B within the Test Base by targeting regions within the RNA genomes of the two viruses. The amplification target for influenza A is the polymerase basic gene 2 (PB2); the amplification target for influenza B is the polymerase acidic gene (PA). Separate results for influenza A and influenza B are reported by the test. Alere i influenza A & B 2 assay technology is isothermal and does not require a heat denaturation step to generate a single strand target for amplification. Instead a thermostable, strand-displacing DNA polymerase, a thermostable nicking endonuclease, and two oligonucleotide templates (primers) are utilized. Reverse transcription is also performed in the reaction. The products of Alere i influenza A & B 2 amplification are two complementary oligonucleotides 30-40 nucleotides in length. A product of this size is of sufficient length to be highly unique amongst genomes. The exact length of the products depends on the specific placement of the templates relative to one another and relative to their complementary sequences within the target genome.

The Alere i influenza A & B 2 test uses fluorescently-labeled molecular beacon probes for sensitive and specific real-time detection. Results (positive, negative, or invalid) are displayed by the Alere i Instrument. Results are also stored in an on-board archive and are assigned to a sample ID that has been entered into the Alere i Instrument by the operator, and the date/time the test was performed. Data can be retrieved and downloaded by the operator at any time after testing. An external Alere Universal Printer can be attached via USB to the Alere i Instrument to print test results.

# Interpretation of results:

Alere i influenza A & B 2 consists of two fluorescence channels for each tube: ROX for the influenza A or influenza B channels and FAM for the Internal Control (IC) channel. The response curves are analyzed within a decision algorithm to form an assay result. Results are reported to the end user as positive, negative or invalid.

Alere i influenza A & B 2 contains an internal control in the influenza B reaction tube. The control has been designed to monitor functionality of the amplification/detection process and reagents. Detection of the IC occurs via a molecular beacon that specifically detects the amplified product generated from the IC RNA oligonucleotide. In positive samples where target amplification is strong, the internal control is ignored and the target amplification serves as the ‘control’ to confirm that the clinical sample was not inhibitory and that assay reagent performance was robust. At a low frequency, clinical samples can contain inhibitors that may generate invalid results.

Procedural Control Valid displayed on the instrument screen indicates that the assay reagents maintained their functional integrity and the sample did not significantly inhibit assay performance.

Alere i influenza A & B External Controls are designed for use with Alere i influenza A & B 2 assay. The Positive Control swab is coated with inactivated Influenza A and B viruses dried onto a swab. The Negative Control swab is coated with inactivated Streptococcus Group C dried onto a swab. External control swabs are provided with the Alere i influenza A & B 2 kit and are also available separately.

Reproducibility Study

A reproducibility study of Alere i Influenza A & B 2 was conducted by operators at three sites using panels of blind coded specimens containing negative, low positive , and moderate positive influenza A and influenza B samples. Nine operators from three sites (3 operators per site) participated in the study. The study was conducted over five days each for the VTM and the Swab Direct panels. On each day of testing each operator tested a blinded panel of 10 swabs comprised of the following sample types: true negative (clinical matrix diluent), moderate positive (3x LOD), and low positive $( 2 \mathrm { x } \ \mathrm { L O D } )$ of each influenza type A and B. Swab samples were prepared using the influenza A and B strains diluted to the appropriate concentration in clinical matrix diluent.

For VTM samples, the percent agreement with expected results for the influenza A moderate positive and low positive samples was $100 \%$ (90/90) and $9 8 . 9 \%$ (89/90), respectively. The percent agreement with expected result for the influenza B moderate positive and low positive samples was $100 \%$ (90/90). All of the true negative samples (90) generated negative test results. For Direct Swab samples, the percent agreement with expected results for the influenza A moderate positive and low positive samples were $100 \%$ (90/90). The percent agreement with expected result for the influenza B moderate positive and low positive samples were $100 \%$ (89/89) and $9 8 . 9 \%$ (89/90), respectively. All of the true negative samples (89) generated negative test results. There were no significant differences observed within run (replicates tested by one operator), between runs (five different days), between sites (three sites), or between operators (nine operators).

The Reproducibility Study site-to-site qualitative results (agreements with expected results) are presented in Tables 2 and 3 below.

Specimen Stability

To provide data supporting the specimen storage recommendations stated in the product package insert, an analytical study was carried out to evaluate specimen stability.

Contrived positive nasal swab samples were prepared using the Influenza A/Texas/250/2012 and Influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008 dilutions in pooled negative clinical matrix with targeted concentrations near the respective limit of detection (LOD) levels. Mock negative nasal swab samples were prepared using pooled clinical matrix. Swabs were prepared by coating $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the virus dilution or clinical matrix onto the swab. Swab coating was done by lightly scratching the swab surface with the pipette tip as the dilution was pipetted to ensure liquid was absorbed into the swab tip. All prepared swabs were tested at $\Nu { = } 1 0$ at each of the following three time points/conditions: For Direct Swabs, Time 0, 3 hours at $3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 22 hours at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Swabs tested after 22 hours at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ were obtained from the group of swabs stored for 3 hours at $3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for a total of 25 hours elapsed before testing. For swabs eluted in VTM, $2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ was tested according to the VTM assay procedure at the following time points: 0, 9 hours at $3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 45 hours at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and 64 hours at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Positive samples were considered stable as long as they tested positive in Alere i Influenza A & B 2. Negative samples were considered stable as long as they generated negative results in the test. Results of the Direct Swab and VTM stability studies are shown in Tables 4 and 5 below.

1 Unless otherwise indicated, $^ +$ or – represents 10/10 concurrence with the expected result. 2 Retest from the same sample receiver generated the expected result.

Direct swab method samples generated expected results for each sample type at each storage time point except at Time 0 when one Flu B false negative result was generated; repeat testing using the same Sample Receiver generated expected results and all later testing generated expected results. One presumed negative swab generated a Flu B false positive result; repeat testing using the same Sample Receiver generated expected results. After 22 hours of storage at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , one presumed negative swab generated a Flu B false positive result; repeat testing using the same Sample Receiver generated expected results. VTM method samples generated expected results for each sample type at each storage time point except at Time 0 for the clinical matrix diluent which generated one Flu B false positive result. Repeat testing using the same Sample Receiver generated expected results and all later testing generated expected results.

The package insert states that nasal or nasopharyngeal swab samples can be stored at room temperature for up to two hours. If the swab will be held longer than two hours, it must be refrigerated at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and tested within 24 hours from the time of sample collection.

The package insert also states that VTM samples can be held at room temperature for up to eight hours. If the eluted swab sample will be held longer than eight hours, it must be refrigerated at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and tested within 72 hours from the time of sample collection.

# Shelf Life

Alere performed a product stability study to generate stability data to support the expiry assigned to Alere i influenza A & B 2 test kits and control swabs. The test components were tested at specified time points using the influenza A & B Positive QC LOD Controls, and influenza Positive Control Swabs as the positive samples. The QC LOD Controls are approximately 3X the LOD when $5 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ of a control is added to the sample receiver. Elution Buffer, UTM, Negative Controls Swabs, and presumed negative nasal swabs were tested as negative samples. Table 6 details the sample type and number of replicates tested at each time point for each condition.

To perform testing of influenza A and B QC LOD controls, $5 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the control material was added to the Sample Receiver and mixed by pipetting up and down and swirling the pipette tip for 10 seconds. To perform testing of the Elution Buffer, no samples was added to the Sample Receiver. The buffer was transferred to the Test Base using the Transfer Cartridge when prompted by the instrument. For testing VTM samples, $2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of VTM was added to the Sample Receiver and mixed by pipetting up and down and swirling the pipette tip for 10 seconds. Tests were considered stable as long as they continued to produce positive results for positive samples and negative results for negative samples.

# Swab Type Compatibility Study

Alere performed a swab type validation study to establish which swabs are acceptable for use with the Alere i Influenza A & B 2 assay. Swab samples were prepared using influenza A and influenza B strains diluted to approximately 3 times the limit of detection. Swabs were prepared by coating $1 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the influenza A virus dilution, influenza B virus dilution or clinical matrix diluent on the swab. Ten samples of each swab type were prepared for each sample type (influenza A, influenza B, or clinical matrix). Swab coating was done by lightly scratching the swab surface with the pipette tip as the solution was pipetted to ensure liquid was absorbed into the swab tip. All swabs were tested within 10 minutes of coating.

Swabs tested in this study include: Puritan Small Foam Tipped Swab; Puritan Regular Foam Swab; Puritan Regular Rayon Swab; Puritan Mini Rayon Swab; Puritan PurFlock Standard Swab; Puritan PurFlock Mini Swab; Puritan HydraFlock Flocked Mini Swab; Puritan HydraFlock Standard Swab; Copan Mini-tip Nylon Flocked Swab; Copan Standard Flocked Swab; and Copan Standard Rayon Swab.

All of the swabs, except the Puritan PurFlock Standard Flocked Swab, Puritan PurFlock Mini-tip swab, and the Copan Standard Rayon Swab generated the expected results for all ten replicates for each sample type. A precaution has been added to the package insert warning the Puritan PurFlock Standard Flocked Swab, Puritan PurFlock Mini-tip swab, and the Copan Standard Rayon Swabs are not acceptable to be used with this assay. All other commonly used flocked swabs appear to be acceptable.

# Viral Transport Media Validation Study

Sixteen common transport media were tested in a VTM validation study to determine if the particular media type is acceptable for use with VTM specimens in the Alere i Influenza A & B 2 assay. Presumed negative nasal swabs were eluted in $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of each VTM type by swirling and mixing the swab for 10 seconds. For each VTM type, $\mathrm { n } { = } 1 0$ clinical matrix diluent (negative sample), influenza A, and influenza B samples were tested at a volume of $2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ on the Alere i Influenza A & B 2 test according to the VTM assay procedure. Dilutions of influenza A and influenza B were prepared at a concentration approximately 3 times the VTM limit of detection level in each VTM type clinical matrix diluent. A VTM was considered acceptable if positive influenza samples generated positive influenza result and negative samples (clinical matrix diluent) generated negative results. A summary of the testing is shown in the table 8 below.

\* Unless otherwise indicated, $^ +$ or – represents 10/10 concurrence with the expected result.

The results of this study indicate Tryptose Phosphate Broth, Brain Heart Infusion Broth, Veal Infusion Broth, and Wako’s E-MEM are not compatible with the Alere i Influenza A & B 2 assay. A note has been added to the package insert stating that these four media are not appropriate for use in this assay. All other media tested produced the expected results and are acceptable for use in the assay.

# d. Detection limit:

The objective of the Analytical Sensitivity Study was to identify the limit of detection (LOD) of the Alere i Influenza A & B 2 using characterized strains of influenza A and influenza B. For the purposes of the study, the LOD level was defined as concentration of influenza A and influenza B that produced positive Alere i Influenza A & B 2 test results approximately $9 5 \%$ of the time when tested in multiple replicates.

The Swab Direct Method samples were tested on the Alere i Influenza A & B 2 test according to the swab direct assay procedure. VTM samples were each eluted into a separate vial containing $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of UTM. Four swab eluates were combined and mixed thoroughly by gentle vortex. The four eluates were combined in order to prepare homogenous sample volume sufficient to test 40 replicates. Each swab eluate was tested on the Alere i Influenza A & B 2 test according to the VTM assay procedure.

For both methods, Probit analysis was first performed to determine the LOD of the sample. The LOD was then verified by testing 20 replicates. If $9 5 \%$ or greater detection was obtained with the concentration then that concentration was considered the LOD for that lot. If less than $9 5 \%$ positive results were obtained, a 2-fold higher concentration of virus was tested at $\mathrm { n } { = } 2 0$ replicates. If the $2 \mathbf { x }$ more concentrated panel resulted in $100 \%$ detection, a $0 . 5 \mathrm { x }$ dilution was tested to ensure the LOD is not lower than the level determined via Probit analysis.

A minimum of $0 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of each dilution was retained at ${ } _ { - 8 0 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for determination of the concentration in targets $/ \mathrm { m L }$ via qPCR. The empirically determined LOD for each specimen type and each influenza strain is shown in the table below along with the corresponding genome equivalents $/ \mathrm { m L }$ .

# e. Analytical reactivity:

Various influenza A and influenza B strains were tested to examine the ability of the Alere i Influenza A & B 2 to detect a wide variety of virus strains in a clinical setting. Samples were prepared as swab specimens and tested using the swab direct procedure.

Dilutions of each virus were prepared in clinical matrix diluent and $1 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of each dilution was dispensed on to sterile foam swabs. All viral dilutions were run in triplicate. Swab direct samples were prepared using the influenza A and B strains diluted in clinical matrix to approximately three times the swab direct limit of detection levels as defined in the Analytical Sensitivity Study. If initial testing generated at least one negative result at the initial concentration, a higher concentration was tested and then diluted 2-fold until negative results were obtained. The lowest level of each strain that generated positive results on all three replicates was identified as the lowest level detected by Alere i Influenza A & B 2. A dilution level was considered positive if all three replicates generated a positive result. At least one out of three negative results was considered a negative result in the study.

The lowest detectable dilutions were stored frozen at ${ } _ { - 8 0 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ until conclusion of testing each day. This dilution was used to determine concentration in targets/mL via validated qPCR. A summary of the results of the reactivity testing is presented in the table 10 below.

# f. Analytical specificity:

To determine the analytical specificity of Alere i Influenza A & B 2, 36 commensal and pathogenic microorganisms (18 bacteria, 17 viruses, and 1 yeast) that may be present in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx were tested. All following microorganisms were negative when tested at concentrations ranging from $1 0 ^ { 3 }$ to $1 0 ^ { \dag 0 }$ cells/mL or $\mathrm { C F U / m L }$ (bacteria), ${ 1 0 } ^ { 4 }$ to $1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ (viruses), and $1 0 ^ { 8 }$ cells/mL (yeast).

Swab samples were prepared using influenza A and influenza B strains diluted to approximately three times the swab direct limit of detection in clinical matrix diluent. Swabs were prepared by coating $1 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the virus dilution onto the swab. Swab coating was done by lightly scratching the swab surface with the pipette tip as the solution was pipetted to ensure liquid was absorbed into the swab tip.

A volume of $5 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of each interfering substance was dispensed into sterile tubes. Blank swabs or influenza A or influenza B inoculated swabs were placed into each tube in triplicate. Swabs were stirred to absorb all of the liquid into the swab head. Blank swabs containing only the potentially interfering substance were tested to determine if the substance causes false positive or invalid results in the assay. None of the substances were found to affect test performance at the concentrations tested. False negative results were observed when mucin was present at a concentration of $1 \% \mathrm { \ : w / v }$ or greater and has been noted in the package insert Limitations section.

# h. Microbial Interference:

Alere i Influenza A & B 2 testing was performed in the presence of non-influenza respiratory pathogens. Vendor provided stocks of influenza A and B strains were diluted in clinical matrix to approximately three times the swab direct limit of detection. Contrived swab specimens were prepared by coating 10 microliters of virus dilution onto each swab. Fifty microliters of each of the three potentially interfering viruses were dispensed into sterile tubes.

One of the influenza A or influenza B inoculated swabs was placed into each tube $\mathrm { \Pi } _ { \mathrm { n } } { = } 3$ influenza A and $\mathrm { n } { = } 3$ influenza B swabs total for each non-influenza virus). Swabs were stirred to absorb all of the liquid into the swab head. Swabs were tested immediately as a swab direct sample according to the Alere i Influenza A & B 2 test procedure. The potentially interfering viruses, the concentrations tested, and the test results are shown in the table 14 below.

Unless otherwise indicated, $^ +$ or – represents $3 / 3$ concurrence with the expected result.

This study demonstrated that RSV may potentially interfere with the ability of the test to positively identify influenza A or influenza B if present as a co-infection. A limitation has been added to the package insert to inform the user of such a possible outcome.

The Sponsor also tested influenza A and influenza B near the LOD when a high titer co-infection with the other influenza type was present (i.e., influenza $\mathrm { A } + 3 0 \mathrm { x }$ LOD co-infection with influenza B or vice versa). All tests produced the expected results for all replicates $( \mathrm { n } { = } 3 )$ .

# i. Carry-over:

To test for the possibility of cross-contamination between runs, samples containing both influenza A and influenza B were prepared in clinical matrix diluent at approximately 30 times each strain’s limit of detection level. Swab direct samples were prepared by coating $1 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the virus dilution onto the swab. Swab coating was done by lightly scratching the swab surface with the pipette tip as the solution was pipetted to ensure liquid was absorbed into the swab tip. VTM method samples were tested on the Alere i Influenza A & B 2 test according to the VTM assay procedure.

For each testing method (Swab Direct and VTM), testing alternated between positive and negative samples for a total of 15 rounds (15 positives and 15 negatives) on one Alere i instrument. All positive and negative daily controls generated the expected results on each day of testing. A summary of the results of the Direct Swab and VTM testing is shown in the table below.

All positive samples generated influenza A positive and influenza B positive signals. All negative samples generated influenza A negative and influenza B negative signals.

j. Assay cut-off:

Alere i Influenza A & B 2 consists of three fluorescence channels, ROX for influenza A, FAM for influenza B, and ROX for the Internal Control (IC). Their fluorescent processes physically occur in two separate tubes: ROX for influenza A in Tube 1 while ROX for influenza B and FAM for the Internal Control in Tube 2. The response curves are analyzed within a decision algorithm to form an assay result. For each response curve, the gradient values within the threshold window are compared to the gradient threshold and the results of this comparison determine the channel result, “Asserted”, “Not Asserted”, or “Indeterminate”. The gradient threshold (cut-off) in the algorithm was derived through the data collected to support feasibility and from verification studies. These thresholds were subsequently verified during the clinical study performed during the 2016-2017 respiratory season.

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable.

3. Clinical Studies:

A multi-center study was conducted at ten study sites located throughout the U.S. during the 2016-2017 respiratory season. Alere i Influenza A & B 2 was used to evaluate fresh, prospectively collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens from children and adults of all ages presenting with flu-like symptoms and meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria. Samples were tested with Alere i Influenza A & B 2 within two hours of sample collection. At all sites, one swab specimen was tested directly on Alere i Influenza A & B 2 according to product instructions for testing swabs. The other swab was swirled in VTM for 10 seconds and an aliquot tested using the VTM method. The remaining VTM containing the residual swab was stored refrigerated and shipped to the central laboratory on cold packs for reference testing.

A total of 1110 nasopharyngeal swab specimens were enrolled in the study. Of those, 36 specimens did not meet eligibility criteria. A total of 1074 nasopharyngeal swab specimens were considered evaluable. Of the 1074 Subjects that met inclusion/exclusion criteria, four direct swab samples and eleven VTM samples produced invalid results. Additionally, there were six VTM samples that were handled outside of protocol instructions leaving a total of 1070 direct swab specimens and 1057 VTM specimens evaluable for the purpose of data analysis. Patient age and gender distribution for the evaluable specimens is presented in table 16 below.

# N. Instrument Name:

Alere i Instrument

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

The Alere i Instrument is a portable bench-top unit designed to perform in laboratory and point-of care environments. Alere i Influenza A & B 2 components are color-coded to match the corresponding holder on the instrument and designed to only fit in the corresponding holder in one direction. Once properly placed into the instrument, the Alere i Instrument uses image analysis to automatically detect the presence of the Test

Base and to check the test type and expiry date on the barcode present on the Test Base. This triggers the test sequence. Heating, mixing, and detection by fluorescence are provided by the instrument. The Alere i Instrument is equipped with two optical fluorescence modules, FAM and ROX. Each optical module consists of a LED excitation source and photodiode receiver configured to the fluorescent channel. Fluorescence signals are optically filtered by a confocal lens and mirror arrangement and processed by software running on an on-board computer. The results are calculated automatically and presented on the instrument graphical user interface and available for export in JSON format or printing.
