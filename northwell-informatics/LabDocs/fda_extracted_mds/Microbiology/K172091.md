The Influenza A/B Typing Kit contains reagents and controls of the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel and is intended for use in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information:

For qualitative detection of influenza virus type A or B viral RNA in upper respiratory tract clinical specimens (including nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS], nasal swabs [NS], throat swabs [TS], nasal aspirates [NA], nasal washes [NW] and dual nasopharyngeal/throat swabs [NPS/TS]) and lower respiratory tract specimens (including bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL], bronchial wash [BW], tracheal aspirate [TA], sputum, and lung tissue) from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture; To provide epidemiologic information for surveillance of circulating influenza viruses.

Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a season when seasonal influenza viruses A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation and during a season when the A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus was the predominant influenza A virus in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary with other emerging influenza A viruses.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted unless a BSL 3E facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

The Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit contains reagents and controls of the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel and is intended for use in real-time RT-PCR (rRTPCR) assays on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information:

• For the presumptive identification of virus in patients who may be infected with influenza A subtype A(H5) (Asian lineage) from viral RNA in human respiratory specimens and viral culture in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors; To provide epidemiologic information for surveillance of circulating influenza viruses.

Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a season when seasonal influenza viruses A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation and during a season when the A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus was the predominant influenza A virus in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary with other emerging influenza A viruses.

Testing with the influenza H5a and H5b primer and probe sets should not be performed unless the patient meets the most current U.S.Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) clinical and epidemiologic criteria for testing suspect A(H5) specimens. The definitive identification of influenza A(H5) (Asian lineage) either directly from patient specimens or from virus cultures requires additional laboratory testing, along with clinical and epidemiological assessment in consultation with national influenza surveillance experts.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted unless a BSL 3E facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

# IV. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is used in real-time RT-PCR (rRTPCR) assays on the Applied Biosystems® (ABI) 7500 Fast Dx Real-time PCR system. The panel is configured in four separate kits. Each kit consists of oligonucleotide primers, fluorescently labeled hydrolysis probes, and controls which are used in rRT-PCR assays for the in vitro qualitative detection and characterization of influenza virus RNA in respiratory specimens from patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI). Oligonucleotide primers and probes for detection of influenza A, influenza B, and 2009 influenza A (swine origin) were selected from highly conserved regions of the matrix (M), non-structural (NS), and nucleoprotein (NP) genes, respectively. Oligonucleotide primers and probes for characterization and differentiation of influenza A(H3) and $\operatorname { A } ( \mathrm { H } 1 ) \mathsf { p } \mathrm { d } \mathsf { m } 0 9$ viruses and genetic lineages of influenza B were selected from highly conserved regions of their HA genes. Oligonucleotide primers and probes to detect the human RNase P gene (RP) in control samples and clinical specimens is also included in the panel.

# VIII. ANALYTICAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

Analytical Sensitivity - Limit of Detection (LOD) Equivalency Study

The LOD performance equivalency between a cleared extraction method and either the Roche MagNA Pure 96 or the QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL instruments was demonstrated by testing 5-fold serial dilutions of a characterized influenza A(H3N2) virus, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, of known infectious dose $50 \%$ titer. Virus dilutions were prepared using a suspension of beta-propiolactone (BPL) treated A549 cells in viral transport medium (VTM) as diluent. Triplicate samples of each dilution were extracted separately with the cleared Roche MagNA Pure Compact RNA Isolation Kit as well as the investigational instrument and method. The Roche MagNA Pure 96 was evaluated with the Roche DNA and Viral NA Small Volume Kit. The QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL was evaluated with the QIAGEN DSP Virus Kit and the QIAGEN RNA Tissue Mini Kit. Extracted RNA was tested with the InfA and H3 assays from the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel using Invitrogen SuperScript™ III Platinum $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ One-Step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen SuperScript™) and utilizing the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx (ABI 7500 Fast Dx) real-time PCR system. The acceptance criteria for LOD equivalence between the cleared and investigational methods was defined as a demonstration of $100 \%$ positivity (3 out of 3 replicates) at either the same endpoint concentration or within one 5-fold dilution. The results of the study are summarized in Tables 8-5 to 8-7. Each investigational instrument and method showed an equivalent endpoint concentration when compared to the cleared instrument and method.

# Analytical Precision – Reproducibility

A study was performed to assess the reproducibility of the Roche MagNA Pure 96 and QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL instruments. The Roche MagNA Pure 96 was evaluated with the Roche DNA and Viral NA Small Volume Kit. The QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL was evaluated with the QIAGEN DSP Virus Kit and the QIAGEN RNA Tissue Mini Kit. A blinded panel of contrived samples containing a background of BPL treated A549 cells in VTM was assembled by adding a BPL treated influenza A(H3N2) virus, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014. The samples included a moderate positive sample, a low positive sample near the established assay LOD for the CDC Influenza A Subtyping Kit, and a negative sample consisting of background A549 cells and VTM. Three separate testing sites were selected for each extraction instrument platform. The sample panel was tested 5 times by two different analysts at each site over 5 different days. Analysts performed extractions with the investigational instrument and method and tested the extracted nucleic acids with the InfA, H3, and RP assays from the from the CDC Influenza A Subtyping Kit using Invitrogen SuperScript™ and utilizing the ABI 7500 Fast Dx real-time PCR system. The results for the reproducibility studies of each instrument and method are summarized in Tables 8-8 to 8-10. Each instrument and method showed good reproducibility with $100 \%$ agreement across different sites, analysts, and days.

# IX. CLINICAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

The clinical performance of the Roche MagNA Pure 96 and QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL instruments was evaluated to demonstrate equivalency to a method currently cleared with the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time Diagnostic Panel. The Roche MagNA Pure 96 was evaluated using the Roche DNA and Viral NA Small Volume Kit. The QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL was evaluated using the QIAGEN DSP Virus Kit and the QIAGEN RNA Tissue Mini Kit. The comparator was the Roche MagNA Pure Compact instrument using the RNA Isolation Kit. The study was performed internally using retrospective clinical specimens collected during the 2011-2012 and 2013-2014 influenza seasons. A total of thirty specimens that were previously determined to be positive for influenza A(H3) virus and thirty negative specimens were evaluated with the InfA, H3, and RP assays from the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time Diagnostic Panel. Testing was performed using Invitrogen SuperScript™ and utilizing the ABI 7500 Fast Dx real-time PCR system. The results are summarized in the Tables 8-11 to 8-13. Each method demonstrated $100 \%$ agreement with the comparator.

# X. CONCLUSION

Performance studies were conducted to evaluate the modification of the CDC Human Influenza Virus rRT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to add nucleic acid isolation options. Evaluation of the LOD equivalency, reproducibility, and clinical performance demonstrated that the modified device is substantially equivalent to the predicate. The change raises no new issues of safety and effectiveness and the indications for use remain the same.
