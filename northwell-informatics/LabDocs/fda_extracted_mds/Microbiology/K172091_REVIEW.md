# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

# CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel - Influenza A/B Typing Kit:

The Influenza A/B Typing Kit contains reagents and controls of the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel and is intended for use in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information:

· For qualitative detection of influenza virus type A or B viral

RNA in upper respiratory tract clinical specimens (including nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS], nasal swabs [NS], throat swabs [TS], nasal aspirates [NA], nasal washes [NW] and dual   
nasopharyngeal/throat swabs [NPS/TS]) and lower respiratory tract specimens (including bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL], bronchial wash [BW], tracheal aspirate [TA], sputum, and lung tissue) from human patients with signs and symptoms of   
respiratory infection and/or from viral culture;   
To provide epidemiologic information for surveillance of circulating influenza viruses.

Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a season when seasonal influenza viruses A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation and during a season when the $\mathrm { A ( H 1 N 1 ) p d m } 0 9$ influenza virus was the predominant influenza A virus in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary with other emerging influenza A viruses.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted unless a BSL 3E facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

All users, analysts, and any person reporting results from use of this device should be trained to perform and interpret the results from this procedure by a competent instructor prior to use. CDC Influenza Division will limit the distribution of this device to only those users who have successfully completed a training course provided by CDC instructors or designees.

The Influenza A Subtyping Kit contains reagents and controls of the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel and is intended for use in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) 7500 Fast

Dx Real-Time PCR instrument in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information:

· For determination of the subtype of seasonal human influenza A viruses as seasonal A(H3), and/or A(H1)pdm09 from viral RNA in upper respiratory tract clinical specimens (including nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS], nasal swabs [NS], throat swabs [TS], nasal aspirates [NA], nasal washes [NW] and dual nasopharyngeal/throat swabs [NPS/TS]) and lower respiratory tract specimens (including bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL], bronchial wash [BW], tracheal aspirate [TA], sputum, and lung tissue) from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture;   
· To provide epidemiologic information for surveillance of circulating influenza viruses.

Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a season when seasonal influenza viruses A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation and during a season when the A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus was the predominant influenza A virus in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary with other emerging influenza A viruses.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing.

CDC Influenza Division will limit the distribution of this device to only those users who have successfully completed a training course provided by CDC instructors or designees.

# CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel - Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Kit:

The Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Kit contains reagents and controls of the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel and is intended for use in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information:

For the determination of the genetic lineage of human influenza B viruses as B/Victoria or B/Yamagata lineage from viral RNA in upper respiratory tract clinical specimens (including nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS], nasal swabs [NS], throat swabs [TS], nasal aspirates [NA], nasal washes [NW] and dual nasopharyngeal/throat swabs [NPS/TS]) from human patients with signs and symptoms of   
respiratory infection and/or from viral culture;   
To provide epidemiologic information for surveillance of circulating influenza viruses.

Performance characteristics for influenza B lineage genotyping were established during a season when influenza B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages were found in approximately equal proportion.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.

All users, analysts, and any person reporting results from use of this device should be trained to perform and interpret the results from this procedure by a competent instructor prior to use. CDC Influenza Division will limit the distribution of this device to only those users who have successfully completed a training course provided by CDC instructors or designees.

# CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel - Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit (VER 3):

The Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit contains reagents and controls of the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel and is intended for use in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information:

For the presumptive identification of virus in patients who may be   
infected with influenza A subtype A(H5) (Asian lineage) from viral RNA in human respiratory specimens and viral culture in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors;   
To provide epidemiologic information for surveillance of circulating influenza viruses.

Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a season when seasonal influenza viruses A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation and during a season when the $\mathrm { A ( H 1 N 1 ) p d m } 0 9$ influenza virus was the predominant influenza A virus in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary with other emerging influenza A viruses.

Testing with the influenza H5a and H5b primer and probe sets should not be performed unless the patient meets the most current U.S.Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) clinical and epidemiologic criteria for testing suspect A(H5) specimens. The definitive identification of influenza A(H5) (Asian lineage) either directly from patient specimens or from virus cultures requires additional laboratory testing, along with clinical and epidemiological assessment in consultation with national influenza surveillance experts.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted unless a BSL 3E facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

NA

# L. Test Principle:

The CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel includes sets of oligonucleotide primers and dual-labeled hydrolysis probes to be used in real-time RT-PCR assays on the Applied Biosystems (ABI) 7500 Fast Dx Real-time PCR instrument. The targeted regions of influenza viral RNA are transcribed into complimentary DNA (cDNA) and amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The fluorescently labeled probes anneal to amplified DNA fragments and the fluorescent signal intensity is monitored by the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-time PCR instrument during each PCR cycle. Amplification of target is recorded as increase of fluorescence over time in comparison to background signal.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Using the CDC Influenza A Subtyping Kit as the representative assays from the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel, studies were conducted to assess the reproducibility of the two additional nucleic acids extraction instrument platforms to be used with the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel test kits. The Roche MagNA Pure 96 was evaluated with the Roche DNA and Viral NA Small Volume Kit. The QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL was evaluated with the QIAGEN EZ1 DSP Virus Kit and the QIAGEN EZ1 RNA Tissue Mini Kit.

A blinded panel of contrived samples containing a background of betapropiolactone (BPL) treated A549 cells in viral transport medium (VTM) was assembled by adding a BPL treated influenza A(H3N2) virus, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014. The samples included a moderate positive sample, a low positive sample near the established assay LoD for the CDC Influenza A Subtyping Kit, and a negative sample consisting of background A549 cells and VTM.

Three separate testing sites were selected for each extraction instrument platform. The sample panel was tested five times by two analysts at each site over five days. Analysts performed extractions with the investigational nucleic acids extraction instrument platform and the relevant extraction method(s),

and tested the extracted nucleic acids with the InfA, H3, and RP assays from the CDC Influenza A Subtyping Kit using Invitrogen SuperScript and utilizing the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx (ABI 7500 Fast Dx) real-time PCR system.

Each nucleic acids extraction instrument platform and the relevant extraction method demonstrated acceptable reproducibility with $100 \%$ agreement across different sites, analysts, and days.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable, qualitative tests.   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Not applicable, aspects of the tests other than nucleic acids extraction options are not modified from the previously FDA-cleared versions.

# d. Detection limit:

The LoD performance equivalency between a previously FDA-cleared nucleic acids extraction method and either the Roche MagNA Pure 96 or the QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL nucleic acids extraction instrument platform and the relevant extraction method was evaluated by testing 5-fold serial dilutions of a characterized influenza A(H3N2) virus, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, of known embrio infectious dose $50 \%$ titer $\left( \mathrm { E I D } _ { 5 0 } \right)$ , using the CDC Influenza A Subtyping Kit as the representative assays from the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel.

Virus dilutions were prepared using a suspension of BPL treated A549 cells in VTM as diluent. Triplicate samples of each dilution were extracted separately with the previously FDA-cleared Roche MagNA Pure Compact RNA Isolation Kit, as well as the investigational nucleic acids extraction instrument platform and the relevant extraction method. The Roche MagNA Pure 96 was evaluated with the Roche DNA and Viral NA Small Volume Kit. The QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL was evaluated with the QIAGEN EZ1DSP Virus Kit and the QIAGEN EZ1 RNA Tissue Mini Kit.

Extracted RNA was tested with the InfA and H3 assays from the CDC Influenza A Subtyping Kit using Invitrogen SuperScript III Platinum One-Step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen SuperScript™) and utilizing the ABI 7500 Fast Dx real-time PCR system.

The pre-established acceptance criteria for demonstrating LoD equivalence between the previously FDA-cleared and the investigational extraction methods was defined as a demonstration of $100 \%$ positivity (3 out of 3 replicates) at either the same endpoint concentration or within one 5-fold dilution. The results of the study are summarized in Table 4 to Table 6 below.

Performance testing natural clinical specimens using the two additional nucleic acids extraction instrument platforms with the CDC Human Influenza Virus RealTime RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel test kits, the Roche MagNA Pure 96 and the QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL instrument platforms, was evaluated in a study using the CDC Influenza A Subtyping Kit as the representative assays from the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to demonstrate equivalent performance when testing natural clinical specimens to a nucleic acids extraction instrument platform and extraction method combination that was previously FDA-cleared for use with the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time Diagnostic Panel test kits (the comparator).

The Roche MagNA Pure 96 was evaluated using the Roche DNA and Viral NA Small Volume Kit. The QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL was evaluated using the QIAGEN EZ1 DSP Virus Kit and the QIAGEN EZ1 RNA Tissue Mini Kit. The comparator was the Roche MagNA Pure Compact instrument using the RNA Isolation Kit.

The study was conducted internally testing a set of retrospective clinical specimens collected during the 2011-2012 and 2013-2014 influenza seasons. A total of thirty clinical specimens that were previously determined to be positive for influenza A(H3) virus and thirty negative clinical specimens were evaluated with the InfA, H3, and RP assays from the CDC Influenza A Subtyping Kit as representative assays from the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. Testing was performed using Invitrogen SuperScript and utilizing the ABI 7500 Fast Dx real-time PCR system. The study results are summarized in the Table 7 to Table 9 below.
