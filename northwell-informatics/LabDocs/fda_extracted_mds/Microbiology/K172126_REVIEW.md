# I. Device Description:

The Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay is an automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in vitro diagnostic test for qualitative detection of Streptococcus pyogenes directly from throat swab specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of pharyngitis.

The Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert Instrument Systems (GeneXpert Dx, GeneXpert Infinity-48s, and GeneXpert Infinity-80 systems), that automate sample preparation, DNA amplification and real-time detection in single-use, disposable cartridges.

The Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay cartridge contains a pair of PCR primers and a hydrolysis probe that enable detection of a conserved DNA sequence within the S. pyogenes genome.

The assay also incorporates a Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) to monitor the integrity of the reagents and process workflow.

The GeneXpert Instrument Systems have between 1 and 80 randomly accessible modules, depending upon the instrument, that are each capable of performing separate sample preparation and real-time PCR assays. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids, an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells, and a thermocycler unit for real-time PCR amplification and detection.

Once the instrument is loaded and the test initiated, all the steps associated with sample processing, PCR amplification/detection and result interpretation occur automatically. The final result report can be viewed on-screen and/or printed.

# L. Test Principle:

The Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay is performed on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems (GeneXpert Dx, GeneXpert Infinity-48s, and GeneXpert Infinity-80 systems) that automate nucleic acid extraction, amplification and detection in single-use, disposable cartridges. Each cartridge contains primers and probes for detection of the targeted region of the S. pyogenes chromosome (if present) and a Sample Processing Control (SPC). The SPC and a separate Probe Check Control (PCC) are used by the GeneXpert systems to monitor reagent and process integrity.

Throat swab specimens for testing with the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay are collected using the Copan Liquid Amies Elution Swab (ESwab) Collection and Transport System. Upon receipt in the testing laboratory, the ESwab tube is mixed by shaking and $3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the

transport medium is added to an Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay cartridge using a disposable transfer pipette. The operator then initiates the test from the user interface and loads the cartridge into the GeneXpert instrument, after which all process steps are performed automatically.

Once complete, the final result report can be viewed on-screen and/or printed. Results are reported as Strep A DETECTED, Strep A NOT DETECTED, INVALID (SPC failure), ERROR (SPC and PCC failure) or NO RESULT (insufficient data collected). Instructions for retesting are provided for samples with indeterminate results.

The Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay has an Early Termination Feature whereby results for samples that are strongly positive for S. pyogenes are reported prior to completion of the full number of PCR cycles designated in the assay definition file.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

To estimate the components of variance associated with the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay a Reproducibility Study was conducted at 3 sites, with 2 operators per site. Each operator tested a 3 member panel of samples in duplicate twice per day over 6 days using 3 lots of reagents (3 sites $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ operators/site x 2 panels/day x 2 replicates/panel member $\mathrm { \times 6 \ d a y s = 1 4 4 }$ results/panel member). Two sites conducted testing using the GeneXpert Dx and one site used the Infinity-80. Samples were prepared using simulated throat swab matrix in Liquid Amies transport medium and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until testing. Separate studies were conducted to demonstrate equivalent assay performance with simulated and natural throat swab matrix (Section M(2)(b)). The panel members used in the Reproducibility Study are summarized in Table 1.

When the study was initially performed, there was an unexpectedly high rate of indeterminate results $( 4 7 / 4 3 2 = 1 0 . 8 \% )$ , although no false positive or false negative results were observed (i.e., there was $100 \%$ agreement at all target levels among samples with valid results). An investigation showed that the high rate of indeterminate results was due to a combination of the duration of storage of the

simulated samples prior to testing, in combination with the specific reagent lots used in the study. Even though the results of the Reproducibility Study were acceptable, the study was repeated using new panel members that were stored for a shorter duration prior to testing, as well as new reagent lots. The results of the repeat study are described below.

Eleven (11) indeterminate results were obtained over the course of the repeat study (ERROR: 5; INVALID: 4 and NO RESULT: 2) for an initial indeterminate rate of $2 . 5 \%$ (11/432). In all cases, the expected results were obtained upon retesting.

After retesting, percent agreement with the expected results for Negative and Moderate Positive target levels was $100 \%$ (144/144). For Low Positive samples, the percent agreement was $9 8 . 6 \%$ (142/144). ANOVA (Analysis Of Variance) was performed to assess the variance components of the Ct values for the S. pyogenes and SPC targets (Table 2). The total variation for all targets was between 0.9 and $2 . 3 \ \mathrm { C t }$ $( 2 . 5 { - } 6 . 6 \% )$ .

The Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay demonstrated acceptable reproducibility across sites, GeneXpert systems, operators, panel members and reagent lots.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Internal Controls   
Each Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay includes two types of Internal Control to monitor   
the performance of the system:

Sample Processing Control (SPC): Designed to monitor bacterial lysis and sample inhibition. Test results are reported as INVALID if the SPC fails.

Probe Check Control (PCC): Fluorescence measurement to monitor probe rehydration and integrity, as well as filling of the reaction tube. Test results are reported as ERROR if the PCC fails.

The performance of the Internal Controls was verified by testing 29 potential failure modes due to errors in the manufacture of the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay cartridges or the assay procedure. Under the conditions tested, no false positive results were obtained and all S. pyogenes negative samples were reported as either Negative, Error or Invalid. Two false negative results were obtained with S. pyogenes positive samples, the remainder of which were reported as Positive, Error or Invalid. The device manufacturer implemented appropriate measures by which to mitigate the risks associated with the failure modes that gave rise to false negative results, including use of a fixed volume pipette for sample transfer and $100 \%$ manual inspection during cartridge assembly.

# External Controls

The device labeling includes information regarding the availability of commercially prepared External Positive and Negative Controls. These External Controls were run each day During the Clinical Study for the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay (Section M(3)(a)) prior to testing of any clinical specimens. A summary of the results obtained is shown in Table 3.

An additional evaluation of the recommended External Controls was conducted by testing 3 lots of each control material with 3 lots of Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay reagents. All 180 pairs $( 1 0 0 \% )$ of the External Positive Negative Controls tested produced the expected results.

# Specimen Stability

The stability of throat swab specimens for use with the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay was determined analytically by testing ESwabs seeded with pooled throat swab matrix in the presence and absence of $S .$ pyogenes strain ATCC BAA-946 at approximately 3X LoD (26 CFU/mL). Specimens were placed at different temperatures and tested at pre-specified intervals. Results were analyzed qualitatively and by ANOVA to assess differences in $\mathrm { C t }$ values for the S. pyogenes and SPC targets over time. No false negative or false positive results were observed during the course of the study, although a statistically significant increase in $\mathrm { C t }$ values for the SPC was observed with S. pyogenes negative specimens after storage for 8 days at $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . As a result, the claimed stability of throat swab specimens at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ was restricted to ${ \le } 6$ days. The study also demonstrated the stability of specimens at $1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for ${ \le } 2$ days.

# Reagent Stability

The shelf-life of the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay cassettes was evaluated in a realtime stability study performed on three lots of reagents that were stored under different conditions. The results from the study to-date support assignment of an expiration date 6 months from the day of manufacture for the assay cassettes when stored under the recommended conditions.

# Cartridge Hold Time

After loading onto the GeneXpert Infinity System, assay cartridges may have to wait for a GeneXpert module to become available before being processed. A study was therefore conducted to determine the maximum permissible interval between addition of a sample to an Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay cartridge and testing on the GeneXpert Infinity System. The study was performed with $S .$ . pyogenes positive (3X LoD; 26 CFU/mL) and negative samples prepared with simulated throat swab matrix. The samples were added to Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay cartridges that were held for up to 5 hours under different environmental conditions prior to testing (i.e., ambient temperature/humidity, $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 7 5 \%$ relative humidity or $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } } /$ ambient humidity). The expected results were obtained at each time point and there were no important differences in Ct values under any of the conditions tested. The results of the study support the recommended maximum interval of 4.5 hours from sample addition to the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay cartridges to processing on the GeneXpert Infinity System, with a maximum of 4 hours on the deck of the instrument.

# d. Detection limit:

# Determination of the Limit of Detection

The analytical sensitivity of the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay was evaluated by testing dilutions of two strains of S. pyogenes in pooled throat swab matrix. The Limit of

Detection (LoD) was determined for each strain using logistic regression according to the guidance in CLSI Document EP17-A2. Testing was performed using two lots of reagents and six different concentrations of each strain ranging from $^ { < 2 }$ to 35 CFU/mL of ESwab Transport Medium, in addition to $S .$ . pyogenes negative samples. The LoD point estimates were confirmed by testing an additional 20 replicates of each strain at the claimed LoD target level. At least 19/20 replicates had to produce positive results in order for the LoD to be considered confirmed. The results of the LoD Study are shown in Table 4.

# Analytical Reactivity/Inclusivity

A study was conducted to demonstrate the ability of the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay to detect strains of S. pyogenes representing different emm sequence types, including representatives of those types most commonly isolated in cases of pharyngitis in the U.S. (Table 5). A total of 24 strains were tested at a concentration of $2 6 \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ in simulated throat swab matrix (Section M(2)(b)), corresponding to ${ \sim } 3 \mathrm { X }$ LoD, with four replicates per strain.

Bioinformatic Analysis The inclusivity of the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay primers and probe for the targeted region of the S. pyogenes genome was analyzed in silico using the Basic Local

Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). The assay region was shown to be well conserved, with limited evidence of polymorphisms that could affect primer or probe hybridization. The potential for false-negative Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay results due to unforeseen sequence variation is noted as a Limitation in the device labeling.

# e. Analytical specificity:

The analytical specificity of the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay was evaluated by testing a panel of 63 potentially cross-reactive strains of bacteria, including 15 non-Group A species of Streptococcus, one strain of yeast and six viruses in simulated throat swab matrix (Table 6).

Each strain was tested in triplicate at a concentration of $\mathrm { \dot { \geq } } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ for bacteria and yeast, and ${ \geq } 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 }$ for viruses. In all cases, the expected results were obtained and there was no evidence of the potential for false-positive results due to cross-reaction with non-target organisms. These results are acceptable.

# Bioinformatic Analysis

The specificity of the Xpert Xpress Strep A primers and probes for the targeted sequence was also evaluated through extensive in silico BLAST analysis which showed that positive results with species other than S. pyogenes are unlikely to occur.

Carry-over Contamination Study To determine the potential for sample-to-sample contamination using the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay, testing was performed with alternating “high positive” $_ { \mathrm { { ( > 1 ~ x ~ } } }$ $1 \hat { 0 } ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m i }$ of ESwab Transport Medium) and negative samples that were prepared using simulated throat swab matrix. The study was conducted on two GeneXpert Systems (one GX-IV and one GX-XVI) with 20 high positive and 21 negative samples per instrument. No false-positive of false-negative results were obtained on either system and the results were therefore determined to be acceptable.

# f. Assay cut-off:

Thresholds and cut-offs for the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay are embedded within the Assay Definition File that also encodes the instrument settings required to perform the test. The valid Ct ranges for the S. pyogenes target and SPC are shown in Table 7.

Table 7. Valid Ct ranges for Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay

SPC: Sample Processing Control

In addition to fixed algorithm parameters within the software Assay Definition File for the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay, Lot Specific Parameters (LSP) are also generated for every lot of assay reagents to account for potential variations in production. The LSP are embedded within the barcode of each assay cartridge and are transferred to the GeneXpert instrument system when the barcode is scanned.

# g. Assay interference:

The potential for interference with the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay was evaluated with endogenous and exogenous substances that may be present in throat swab specimens, as well as a representative panel of commensal or potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Testing was performed using simulated throat swab matrix (Section M(2)(b)) in the presence of S. pyogenes ATCC BAA-946 at approximately 3X LoD (26 CFU/mL). S. pyogenes negative samples were also included to assess the potential for interference with the SPC. In addition to analysis of qualitative test results, ANOVA was used to assess differences in Ct values for the $S .$ . pyogenes and SPC targets in relation to appropriate control conditions without any interfering substances or organisms present.

# Interfering Substances Study

All S. pyogenes positive and negative samples $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { n } = 8$ per condition) were correctly identified in the presence of each of the potentially inhibitory substances shown in Table 8 and there were no statistically significant differences in Ct values between the test and control conditions for either the SPC or S. pyogenes targets. Nevertheless, a significant reduction in fluorescence intensity was observed for the S. pyogenes target in the presence of antiseptic mouthwash at $6 . 5 \% \ \mathrm { W / V }$ . These results are noted in the device labeling.

# Microbial Interference Study

The list of microorganisms tested is shown in Table 9. Each of the species was tested at $\geq 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ of ESwab Transport Medium. The Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay correctly identified all the S. pyogenes positive and negative specimens in the study (n $= 4$ per condition) and there were no statistically significant differences in Ct values between the test samples and controls. However, a reduction in fluorescence intensity was observed for both the S. pyogenes target and SPC in the presence of a high concentration of $N .$ lactamica.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable.

b. Matrix comparison:

Comparison of Fresh and Frozen Cell Stocks   
Specimens for analytical evaluation of assay performance were prepared using $S .$ . pyogenes cell stocks that were grown on Tryptic Soy Agar plates for 18-24 hours, suspended in Typtic Soy Broth containing $1 5 \%$ (v/v) glycerol and frozen at ${ } _ { - 8 0 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The concentration of the stocks was determined by performing viable counts. Testing of samples prepared from fresh cell stocks and cell stocks that were frozen at ${ - 8 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ for 10 days showed negligible difference in qualitative assay performance or $\mathrm { C t }$ values. Use of frozen cells stocks in preparation of samples for analytical testing was therefore deemed acceptable.

Comparison of Performance with Natural and Simulated Matrices To provide a sufficient quantity of material for testing, a simulated throat matrix was used for the majority of Analytical Studies. To represent a worst case scenario, for each sample, the ESwab Transport Medium was seeded with $1 5 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of simulated matrix (equal to the absorptive capacity of the swab head). Studies were performed in accordance with the standard assay procedure by transferring $3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the simulated matrix to the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay cartridge.

To assess the suitability of the simulated matrix for use in analytical testing, a comparison study was conducted to confirm that the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay performed similarly in the presence of natural and simulated throat swab matrix. Testing was performed with S. pyogenes ATCC BAA-946 at levels close to the LoD of the assay. The results are summarized in Table 10 and show that the pre-defined acceptance criteria were met at each target level and therefore that the assay exhibited similar analytical sensitivity when performed in the presence of either natural or simulated matrix. Ct values for the S. pyogenes and SPC targets were also similar in both matrices.

# 3. Clinical studies:

# a. Clinical Sensitivity:

The performance of the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay was evaluated in two multicenter studies that were conducted at a total of nine (9) clinical sites in the U.S. Specimens were collected from subjects who presented with a sore throat and at least one other symptom that was characteristic of pharyngitis (e.g., tonsillar exudate, tender cervical lymphadenopathy or fever). All the specimens were collected using the Copan Liquid Amies Elution Swab (ESwab) Collection and Transport System and were used for both Xpert Xpress Strep A testing and the reference culture method. One study evaluated performance of the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay using residual, deidentified specimens that were left over from standard of care testing ( $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ swab), while the second study evaluated specimens that were collected prospectively under informed consent following the collection of swabs for use in standard of care patient management $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ swab).

Testing with the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay was conducted at each of the clinical sites. Residual sample after Xpert testing was shipped at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to a central laboratory for reference culture (inoculation of $1 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ transport medium onto Trypticase Soy Agar with $5 \%$ Sheep Blood and incubation at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ in $5 \% \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ ). All reference cultures were inoculated within 48 hours of specimen collection. Isolated colonies

that exhibited $\beta$ -hemolysis were typed by latex agglutination (Remel Streptex). Culture plates that did not exhibit $\beta$ -hemolytic colonies after 48 hours were recorded as negative for Group A Streptococcus.

Eight hundred and forty-four (844) specimens were initially enrolled in the two studies. Of these, 261 were excluded from the analysis of performance due to failure to comply with the inclusion criteria (19), reference culture procedural error (184), delay in reference culture inoculation (31), delay in shipment (26) or labeling error (1). A total of 583 specimens was therefore included in the analysis. On initial testing, 18/583 specimens $( 3 . 1 \% )$ produced indeterminate results (Error [9], Invalid [6], No Result [3]). Sixteen of the 18 were retested, of which 12 produced valid results that were included in the analysis of performance for a final indeterminate rate of 6/583 $( 0 . 9 \% )$ (Table 11).

The results of the two Clinical Studies were also analyzed separately to determine the performance of the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay with residual clinical specimens from standard of care testing ( $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ swab) and specimens that were collected prospectively $( 2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ swab) (Table 12). Although both residual and prospectively collected specimen types yielded $100 \%$ sensitivity, higher specificity was observed with the residual specimens $9 6 . 4 \%$ vs $9 0 . 9 \%$ ).

The performance of the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay stratified by clinical site and $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ or $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ swab (residual or prospectively collected) is shown in Table 13. The Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay exhibited low specificity at Sites 5 and 6, although 7/16 subjects at these sites with false positive Xpress Strep A Assay results were positive for S. pyogenes by a standard of care rapid antigen test and 13/16 were positive by PCR/bidirectional sequencing. These results are acceptable.
