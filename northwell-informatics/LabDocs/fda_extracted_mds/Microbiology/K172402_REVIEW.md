# I. Device Description:

The ARIES Group A Assay is a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based qualitative in vitro diagnostic test system that consists of the ARIES System or the ARIES M1 System with the associated ARIES Software and an assay-specific Protocol File. The ARIES Group A Assay cassette is a disposable, single-use device that contains nucleic acid purification reagents, an internal Sample Processing Control (SPC), and an assay-specific master mix for the detection of a conserved region of the S. pyogenes sdaB gene. The assay is for use on throat swab specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of pharyngitis.

Throat swab specimens are collected and transported to the testing laboratory using the

Copan or BD Liquid Amies Elution Swab (ESwab) Collection and Transport System (nylon flocked swab with 1mL of liquid Amies medium). An aliquot of the transport medium is added directly to the assay cassette which is loaded into the ARIES instrument for automated nucleic acid extraction, amplification and detection.

The assay cassette includes a Sample Processing Control (SPC) that is extracted and processed with the patient specimen. The SPC is designed to monitor DNA recovery, amplification and detection.

Extracted nucleic acid is transferred through the assay cassette by magnetic beads and the eluted sample is then used to rehydrate lyophilized PCR reagents that are specific for the $S .$ . pyogenes sdaB gene and the SPC. Each primer pair is labeled with a different fluorophore and is detected in a different optical channel of the ARIES Systems. During PCR amplification, synthetic quencher nucleotides are incorporated into the amplified products that result in a decrease in fluorescence in the corresponding optical channel when target DNA is present. Following amplification, melt curve analysis is performed to confirm the identity of the amplicons generated. Results are interpreted automatically using parameters in the ARIES Group A Strep Assay Protocol File as either “Group A Streptococcus Positive”, “Group A Streptococcus Negative” or “Invalid”, and may be reported from the ARIES Software or from the optional SYNCT Software desktop application.

# L. Test Principle:

The ARIES Group A Strep Assay is performed on throat swabs from patients with signs and symptoms of pharyngitis. Specimens are collected using the Copan Liquid Amies Elution Swab (ESwab) Collection and Transport System. Upon receipt in the testing laboratory, the ESwab tube is vortexed to mix the contents, and $2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the transport medium is then added to an ARIES Group A Strep Assay cassette which is loaded into the magazine of the ARIES System for automated processing. Up to 6 cassettes can be loaded in a single magazine. Within the instrument, a barcode on the ARIES Group A Strep Assay cassette is automatically scanned to associate the cassette with the appropriate assay protocol that provides all the necessary information to perform the test, analyze the data and generate the result report.

Each assay cassette contains all the reagents needed for nucleic acid extraction, amplification and detection for one sample and includes a Sample Processing Control (SPC) to monitor reagent and process integrity. Processing of the sample within the assay cassette is fully automated and there is no direct contact between the sample or reagents and the instrument, thereby reducing the potential for contamination.

The extracted nucleic acids are used to rehydrate the lyophilized PCR Master Mix which contains specific, fluorescently labeled primers for the S. pyogenes target and the SPC. The primers contain the synthetic nucleotide base 2'-deoxy-5-methyl-isocytidine (iC). During PCR amplification, incorporation of quencher-modified 2'-deoxyisoguanosine triphosphate (iG) into the nascent DNA strand opposite the iC residues results in a target-specific reduction of fluorescence with each successive cycle as amplicons accumulate. The ARIES Systems monitor the decrease in fluorescence in real-time and use the changes in signal over the course of the reaction to calculate amplification cycle $\mathrm { ( C t ) }$ values. At the end of the reaction the amplification products undergo melt curve analysis to verify their identity. A combination of metrics for the S. pyogenes gene target and the SPC is used for result interpretation. If the S. pyogenes target is detected, the sample is reported as “Group A Streptococcus Positive”. If the S. pyogenes target is not detected but the SPC signal is valid, the sample is reported as “Group A Streptococcus Negative”, otherwise the result is “Invalid”.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Site-to-Site Reproducibility

The reproducibility of the ARIES Group A Strep Assay between sites was evaluated in a study performed by two operators at each of three sites over a period of five days. Each operator tested a blinded panel of S. pyogenes positive and negative samples using the same lot of reagents (3 sites X 2 operators X 5 days X 3 replicates $= 9 0$ data points per panel member). The panels were prepared using simulated throat swab matrix (Section M(2)(b))

and S. pyogenes strain ATCC 700294. The results of the study demonstrated acceptable reproducibility from site-to-site at target levels close to the limit of detection (LoD) of the assay (Table 1).

# Within Laboratory Precision/Repeatability

Within laboratory precision/repeatability of the ARIES Group A Strep Assay was evaluated by two operators who tested a panel of samples in triplicate on a single ARIES instrument over a period of 5 days (2 operators X 3 replicates ${ \mathrm { X } } 5 { \mathrm { d a y s } } = 3 0$ replicates per panel member). The panel members were the same as those used in the Site-to-Site Reproducibility Study, above.

Not applicable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Specimen Stability

The stability of throat swabs for use with the ARIES Group A Strep Assay was evaluated analytically by testing pooled S. pyogenes negative Eswab swab specimens that were seeded with an enumerated suspension of cultured organisms and stored under different conditions. Unseeded Eswab throat matrix was included to assess the effect of specimen storage on the performance of the SPC. Twenty (20) S. pyogenes positive and two (2) S. pyogenes negative assay replicates were tested at each stability time point. The results of these studies support the stability of throat swabs for use with the ARIES Group A Strep Assay when collected using the ESwab Specimen Collection and Transport System for up to 7 days at $4 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { i } }$ , up to 48 hours at $2 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or up to 6 months when frozen at $\mathrm { \leq } \mathrm { - } 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Reagent Stability

The shelf-life of the ARIES Group A Strep Assay cassettes was evaluated in a real-time stability study performed on three lots of reagents that were stored either refrigerated $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ or at room temperature $( 1 5 . 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . The results from the study support assignment of an expiration date 7 months from the day of manufacture for the assay cassettes when stored under the recommended conditions.

# Sample Processing Control

Each ARIES Group A Strep Assay cassette contains a Sample Processing Control (SPC) that is designed to monitor DNA recovery, amplification and detection. Samples that are negative for S. pyogenes by the ARIES assay and in which the SPC is not detected are reported as

“Invalid” and must be retested using the residual swab transport medium and a new test cassette.

# External Controls

External Controls should be tested according to guidelines or requirements of local, provincial and/or federal regulations or accreditation organizations. A reference strain of S. pyogenes or well characterized clinical isolate may be used as a Positive Control. ESwab transport medium may be used as a Negative Control. Alternatively, clinical specimens that are known to be positive or negative for S. pyogenes may be used as Positive and Negative External Controls, respectively.

External Positive and Negative Controls were tested on a daily basis during the prospective Clinical Study described in Section M(3)(a) using a total of four ARIES systems and three reagent lots. The Positive External Control comprised a standardized suspension of a strain of S. pyogenes ATCC 700294 at $1 . 2 4 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 4 } \mathrm { C F U / \dot { m L } }$ (3X LoD). The Negative External Control comprised liquid Amies medium alone. On initial testing, 153/158 $( 9 6 . 9 \% )$ Positive and 163/163 $( 1 0 0 \% )$ Negative External Controls produced the expected results.

# d. Detection limit:

# Limit of Detection

The Limit of Detection (LoD) of the ARIES Group A Strep Assay was estimated for two strains of S. pyogenes by testing various dilutions of enumerated cell stocks in throat swab matrix. The LoD for each strain was then confirmed by testing a further 20 replicates at the lowest target level that produced $100 \%$ positive results. The LoD was defined as the lowest concentration tested at which $2 9 5 \%$ of assay replicates produced positive results. For ATCC 19615, the LoD was determined to be $2 . 5 8 \overset { \cdot } { \mathrm { ~ x ~ } } 1 \overset { \cdot } { 0 ^ { 3 } }$ CFU/mL and for ATCC 700294 it was 4.13 $\mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 3 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ .

# Inclusivity (Analytical Reactivity)

The inclusivity of the ARIES Group A Strep Assay was evaluated by testing nine strains of S. pyogenes in simulated throat swab matrix in addition to those included in the LoD Study (Table 4). Eight of the nine strains produced 3/3 positive results at a concentration of $1 . 2 4 \mathrm { x }$ $\mathrm { i 0 ^ { 4 } C F U / m L }$ (3X the LoD for ATCC 700294). Strain ATCC 12384 gave one false negative result at this target level but produced 3/3 positive results at $2 . 0 7 \times 1 0 ^ { 4 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ , equivalent to 5X LoD for ATCC 700294. These results are acceptable.

# Bioinformatic Analysis

The inclusivity of the ARIES Group A Strep primers for the targeted region of the genome was analyzed in silico using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). The region was shown to be well conserved, with no evidence of sequence heterogeneity that could lead to false negative results. This is acceptable.

# e. Analytical specificity:

# Cross-reactivity Study

The analytical specificity of the ARIES Group A Strep Assay was evaluated by testing a panel of 35 organisms that may be found in throat swab specimens (Table 5). Each strain was tested in triplicate in simulated throat swab matrix at $\dot { \geq } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U } / \overline { { \mathrm { m L } } }$ (or the highest concentration attainable). No false positive or Invalid results were obtained. These results are acceptable.

# Contamination Study

The potential for false-positive results with the ARIES Group A Strep Assay due to within run or between run cross-contamination was evaluated by testing an alternating series of $S _ { \cdot }$ . pyogenes “high positive” and negative samples in successive instrument runs. The high positive samples contained S. pyogenes at a concentration of $1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ of simulated throat swab matrix. Negative samples comprised simulated throat swab matrix alone. The expected results were obtained for all S. pyogenes positive and negative samples (30/30 each). These results are acceptable.

The ARIES Group A Strep Assay result algorithm uses a combination of parameters based on cycle threshold, amplicon melting temperature and fluorescence intensity for the S. pyogenes target and SPC to report results as either Group A Streptococcus Positive, Negative or Invalid. The algorithm parameters were established through Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis using residual S. pyogenes positive and negative clinical specimens that were characterized using the same reference method as in the prospective clinical validation study described in Section M(3)(a).

# g. Assay interference:

Potentially Interfering Substances   
The potential for interference with the ARIES Group A Strep Assay was evaluated with endogenous and exogenous substances that may be present in throat swab specimens (Table 7). Each substance was tested in triplicate in the presence and absence of S. pyogenes using samples prepared with simulated throat swab matrix (Section M(2)(b)). Invalid results were obtained in the presence of mucin at $5 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ although additional testing demonstrated no interference at a concentration of $\leq 4 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ . Two of three samples containing $0 . 5 \%$ NyQuil produced false negative results on initial testing, although repeat analysis under the same condition produced the expected results. The potential for interference with the ARIES Group A Strep Assay in the presence of NyQuil $( 0 . 5 \% \ \mathrm { v / v ) }$ and mucin $\scriptstyle \left( > 4 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { m L } \right)$ ) is noted in the device labeling.

All results (15/15) obtained at $0 . 2 \mathrm { - } 4 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ were as expected.

# Microbial Interference

The potential for interference with the ARIES Group A Strep Assay by organisms that may be present in throat swab specimens was investigated using the same list of species that was evaluated for potential cross-reactivity (refer to Section M(1)(e) and Table 5). Testing was performed in triplicate with each potentially interfering species in the presence of $S$ .

pyogenes ATCC 700294 at 3X LoD. The potentially interfering species were tested at ${ 1 0 } ^ { 6 }$ CFU/mL of simulated throat swab matrix or the highest concentration available. The expected results were obtained with all the organisms tested with the exception of samples containing Treponema denticola for which 2/3 replicates produced false negative results. No titer was available for the T. denticola cell stock used in this study but retesting at a lower concentration $\sim 5 0 \%$ of the original test concentration) produced the expected results.

Although bioinformatic analysis showed no evidence of cross-reaction between the ARIES Group A Strep Assay primers and T. denticola, the potential for interference by this organism is noted in the Limitations section of the device labeling.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable.

b. Matrix comparison:

Comparison of Performance with Natural and Simulated Matrices   
To provide a sufficient quantity of material for testing, a simulated throat matrix was used for the majority of Analytical Studies. Testing with simulated matrix was performed in   
accordance with the standard assay procedure by transferring $2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the sample to the ARIES Group A Strep Assay cartridge.

The suitability of the simulated matrix for use in analytical testing was evaluated in a comparison study with natural clinical matrix. The two matrices were tested in parallel as part of the LoD Study described Section M(1)(d) using S. pyogenes strains ATCC 19615 and 700294. The results demonstrated similar analytical sensitivity in both matrices and there were negligible differences in relevant assay metrics for both the S. pyogenes target and SPC. The study therefore provided acceptable evidence to support the use of simulated matrix in the Analytical Studies to characterize the performance of the ARIES Group Strep A Assay.

# 3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity:

The performance of the ARIES Group A Strep Assay was evaluated in a prospective multicenter study that was conducted at four (4) clinical sites in the U.S. Throat swab specimens were collected from subjects who presented with a signs and symptoms of pharyngitis for whom testing for Group A Streptococcus was ordered by their physician.

At three sites, swab specimens for use in the study were collected under informed consent, while at one site the study was performed using residual, de-identified specimens leftover from standard of care testing. All the specimens were collected using the Copan or BD Liquid Amies Elution Swab (ESwab) Collection and Transport System and refrigerated within 4 hours. The transport medium from each specimen was divided into four aliquots for use in different test methods: #1 $( \geq 1 2 5 \mu \mathrm { L } )$ , for shipment to a centralized laboratory for reference culture; $\# 2$ and $\# 3$ $( \ge 2 5 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ each), for testing with the ARIES Group A Strep Assay at the clinical sites (including repeat analysis, if required); $\# 4$ $( { \geq } 2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L } )$ , stored frozen at $\mathrm { { \le - } } 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { { C } }$ for analysis by PCR/bidirectional sequencing (only performed for subjects with discordant reference culture and ARIES Group A Strep results).

The reference culture procedure was performed within 48 hours of specimen collection and comprised inoculation of Group A Selective Streptococcus Agar and Trypticase Soy Agar (both containing $5 \%$ sheep blood) with $5 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ ESwab transport medium and

incubation under anaerobic conditions for up to 48 hours. Culture plates that did not exhibit $\beta$ -hemolytic colonies after 48 hours were recorded as negative for Group A Streptococcus. $\beta$ -hemolytic colonies present on the primary plates were sub-cultured and identified by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS; Bruker Daltonics, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Seven hundred and thirty-five (735) specimens were initially enrolled in the study. Of these, 112 were excluded from the analysis of performance due to failure to comply with the reference culture protocol or delay in reference culture (67), failure to meet the inclusion criteria or eligibility for inclusion not confirmed (30), insufficient specimen volume (7), use of an incorrect collection swab or eligibility of the swab transport medium not confirmed (3), lack of a pure isolate (2), ARIES testing performed by an ineligible operator (2), or prior enrolment of the subject (1). In addition, five specimens gave inconclusive reference culture results (MALDI-TOF MS log(score) $< 2 . 0 0 \}$ ) and were excluded from the performance calculations. A total of 618 specimens were therefore included in the analysis of performance (Table 8). On initial testing, $6 / 6 2 3$ specimens $( 1 . 0 \% )$ produced Invalid results. All 6 specimens were retested and produced valid results for a final Invalid rate of $0 \%$ (0/623).

The performance of the ARIES Group A Strep Assay at each clinical site in comparison to the reference culture method is shown in Table 9. Although the number of residual specimens tested was small, a higher point estimate for sensitivity was observed in testing performed with specimens collected prospectively under informed consent $( 9 8 . 5 \%$ ; $9 5 \%$ confidence interval $9 4 . 6 \substack { - 9 9 . 6 \% }$ ) than with residual specimens $( 9 2 . 9 \%$ , $9 5 \%$ CI: $7 7 . 4 \mathrm { - } 9 8 . 0 \%$ ). Overall, performance was determined to be acceptable.
