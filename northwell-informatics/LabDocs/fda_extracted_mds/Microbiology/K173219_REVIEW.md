# 2. Indication(s) for use:

The CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK™ test is an enzyme immunoassay for the qualitative detection of a Campylobacter-specific antigen in human fecal specimens. The CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK™ test is designed to detect $C .$ . jejuni and C. coli from patients with symptoms of gastroenteritis. The test is intended for use with preserved fecal specimens in transport media and unpreserved human fecal specimens. Test results should be considered in conjunction with clinical findings and patient history.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

For prescription use only. Optimal results with the CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test are obtained with specimens that are less than 96 hours old. If specimens are not assayed within this time period, they may be frozen. The CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test was evaluated using only fresh fecal samples and fecal samples stored in Cary Blair media or C&S media. The performance of fecal samples stored in other transport media (e.g, formalin, polyvinyl alcohol) has not been evaluated and therefore, should not be used.   
· The CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test is qualitative. The intensity of the color should not be interpreted quantitatively.   
· No data exists on the effects of colonic washes, barium enemas, laxatives, or bowel preparations on the performance of the CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test. All of these procedures can result in extensive dilution or the presence of additives that may affect test performance.

4. Special instrument requirements:

None

# I. Device Description:

The CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK™ test is an enzyme immunoassay for the qualitative detection of Campylobacter spp. in human fecal specimens. The CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test uses antibodies that recognize a Campylobacter-specific antigen. The Microassay Plate in the kit contains immobilized capture monoclonal antibodies against a Campylobacter-specific antigen. The Conjugate consists of polyclonal antibodies to a Campylobacter-specific antigen conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. In the assay, an aliquot of a diluted fecal specimen is transferred to a microassay well containing the Conjugate. If the antigen is present in the specimen, it will bind to the Conjugate and to the immobilized capture antibody during the incubation phase. Any unbound material is removed during the washing steps. Following the addition of the Substrate, a color is detected due to the enzyme-antibody-antigen complexes that formed in the presence of antigen.

The assay kit contains the following:

1. Microassay Plate – 12 strips, each consisting of 8 wells coated with monoclonal antibodies to a Campylobacter-specific antigen (stored with dessicant)   
2. Conjugate (7 mL) – Antibodies to a Campylobacter-specific antigen coupled to horseradish peroxidase in a buffered protein solution containing $0 . 0 5 \%$ ProClin $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 300   
3. Diluent $( 4 0 \mathrm { m L } )$ ) – Buffered protein solution containing $0 . 0 5 \%$ ProClin $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 300. The Diluent is also to be used as the negative control solution   
4. Positive Control $( 3 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ ) – Recombinant Campylobacter-specific antigen in a buffered protein solution containing $0 . 0 5 \%$ ProClin $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 300   
5. Stop Solution $\mathrm { ( 7 ~ m L ) } - 0 . 6 \ : \mathrm { N }$ sulfuric acid   
6. Substrate (14 mL) – solution containing tetramethylbenzidine and peroxide   
7. Wash Buffer Concentrate $( 5 0 \mathrm { m L } ) - 2 0 X$ concentrate containing phosphate buffered saline, detergent, and $0 . 2 \%$ thimerosal

# L. Test Principle:

Enzyme-linked Immunoassay

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The reproducibility of the CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test was determined using an eight member masked fecal specimen panel. The panel consisted of two negative, two high negative (just below C5), two low positive ( $1 { - } 2 \mathbf { x }$ higher than C95), and two moderate positive (2-3x higher than C95) specimens. Each fecal specimen was spiked using known concentration of $C .$ . jejuni whole organism to achieve the desired level. Testing was performed at two independent laboratories and on-site at TECHLAB, Inc. The Specimens were tested twice a day in triplicate over a five day period by multiple technicians at each site using two different kit lots. Positive and negative controls were run with each sample panel of masked specimens. The result from each laboratory were submitted to TECHLAB Inc. and compared. The results were consistent among all three locations with $100 \%$ reproducibility for all test panels.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The effect of specimen storage on antigen stability was evaluated for both fresh samples and samples in transport media. For the analysis, a total of 20 fecal specimens were tested with the CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test. The fecal specimens consisted of $1 0 ~ C .$ . jejuni low positive fecal samples ( $1 - 2 \mathbf { x }$ higher than C95), $5 C .$ . jejuni moderate positive fecal samples ( $2 { - } 3 \mathrm { x }$ higher than C95), and $5 C .$ jejuni high positive fecal samples ( $4 { - } 5 \mathbf { x }$ higher than C95). Both fresh samples and samples stored in Cary Blair and C&S transport media were tested.

For fresh samples, samples were stored between $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and tested at 24 hour intervals up to 168 hours. At the same time positive and negative controls were tested. The following transport media were used for the study: Thermo Scientific Protocol Cary Blair media and Meridian Bioscience Inc., Para-Pak C&S. As recommended in the package insert, Cary Blair and C&S samples were stored between $2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Samples stored in transport media were tested at 24 hour intervals up to 168 hours.

Positive samples remained positive throughout the study. Storage in transport media did not affect the stability of the samples. Based on these results, the recommended storage time for fresh samples is up to 96 hours between $2 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , Cary Blair transport media is up to 96 hours between $2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and C&S transport media is up to 96 hours between $2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ based on the data and the package insert recommendation.

Freeze/Thaw:

Freeze/Thaw stability for raw specimens was demonstrated for six freeze/thaw cycles over a 9 day period. A panel consisting of 20 masked raw stool samples were prepared and tested in duplicate; three true negative, two high negative (1-2x below C5), five low positives ( $_ { 1 - 2 \tt X }$ higher than C95), six moderate positives ( $2 { - } 3 \mathbf { x }$ higher than C95), and four high positives (4-5x higher than C95). All spiked samples yielded positive results after the freeze/thaw cycles. Based on the data submitted, the freezethaw cycle neither enhances nor impairs the performance of the CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of detection (LoD) for the CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test was determined by spectrophotometry at both single $( 4 5 0 \mathrm { n m } )$ and dual wavelength $( 4 5 0 / 6 2 0 \mathrm { n m } )$ using whole organisms of both $C .$ . jejuni and $C .$ . coli spiked into unpreserved (raw stool) and preserved (Cary Blair and C&S media). The concentrations were calculated in colony forming units per milliliter $\mathrm { ( C F U / m L ) }$ and their equivalent in CFU/test by factoring in the dilutions and the final volume used in the assay. The LoD is the concentrations of organisms that yields a positive result $9 5 \%$ of the time and a negative result $5 \%$ of the time. The LoDs that were determined using single wavelength readings for both species were equivalent to those obtained using dual wavelength readings. See Table 2 for LoDs determined at dual wavelength.

# e. Analytical specificity:

# Cross-reactivity Study

The CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test was evaluated for cross-reactivity with the bacteria and viruses listed below. C. helveticus and $C .$ . upsaliensis were found to be cross-reactive at 2 times the LoD of $C .$ . coli $( 3 . 1 4 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { \hat { C } F U / m L } )$ ). In addition, $C .$ lari was found to be cross-reactive at 8 times the LoD of $C .$ . coli $( 1 . 2 6 \mathrm { { x } } 1 0 ^ { 7 } \mathrm { { C F U / m L } } )$ ). All other strains were shown to not interfere with the performance of the CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test. Bacteria was spiked at concentration of ${ > } 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ CFU/mL and viruses at a range from $1 0 ^ { 1 . 7 5 }$ to $1 \dot { 0 } ^ { 8 . 2 5 } \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 }$ units per $0 . 2 \mathrm { m L }$ .

A positive result indicates that Campylobacter antigens were detected. A negative result indicates that no Campylobacter antigens were detected, or that the antigen levels are below what can be detected by the assay.

# g. Prozone:

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that a high concentration of Camplobacter (antigen) does not interfere with a positive reaction in the CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test. High samples were prepared by spiking a negative fecal pool with $5 \mathrm { ~ X ~ } 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ whole organisms of $C .$ . jejuni and $2 . 4 \mathrm { X } \ \mathrm { 1 0 } ^ { \dot { 8 } }$ whole organisms of C. coli. A total of 5 different dilutions of $C .$ . jejuni and $C .$ . coli whole organisms, were prepared and tested. Testing was performed in triplicate according to the Package Insert instructions. The results demonstrated that there was no overall hook affect, and that elevated levels of whole organism did not affect the detection of Campylobacter.

a. Clinical Sensitivity:

Prospective Study

The performance of the CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test was evaluated at four independent sites. The sensitivity and specificity for the CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK device was compared directly to culture results that were obtained from three of the sites. Prospective testing consisted of 1552 stool specimens tested in clinical microbiology laboratories at the Medical College of Wisconsin, Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, TriCore Reference Laboratories, and at TechLab, Inc. The ages of patients ranged from less than 1 year to 100 Years with, $1 5 . 7 \%$ of the specimens coming from patients that were $\leq 1 8$ years. Of the 1552 patients tested $3 8 . 7 \%$ were female and $6 1 . 3 \%$ were male. No difference in test performance was observed based on patient age or gender. The results of the study show that the CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test exhibited a sensitivity of $9 1 . 4 \%$ , and a specificity of $9 9 . 1 \%$ with culture. The results are shown in Table 4.

All samples with discrepant results were tested using an FDA cleared EIA assay, an FDA cleared molecular assay, in-house PCR testing (16s rRNA), and bidirectional sequencing. Of the three false negative results, one sample was confirmed to be negative using these additional tests.

$\ast _ { \mathrm { O f } }$ the 14 culture negative and CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test positive, 8 were confirmed to be positive with all follow-up testing, 2 were confirmed to be positive with commercial EIA, in-house PCR, and bidirectional sequencing, and 4 were confirmed to be positive for $C .$ . upsaliensis by species specific PCR and sequencing. Earlier analytical studies have shown that $C .$ . upsaliensis yields crossreactive results with the CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK.

\*\*One of the three specimens that were culture positive and CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test negative was confirmed to be negative with all tests.

# Retrospective Study

Additional testing was performed on 30 retrospective positive specimens. The patient ages ranged from less than 11 months to 74 years. All retrospective specimens were Campylobacter spp. culture positive and were further characterized as Campylobacter spp. positive by an FDA-cleared commercial EIA assay, an FDA-cleared commercial molecular assay, in-house PCR (detecting the 16s rRNA gene of Campylobacter spp., and species-specific identification), and bidirectional sequencing. These specimens were then tested in the CAMPYLOBACTER CHEK test. All 30 specimens tested positive for Campylobacter spp. by all methods, yielding $100 \%$ correlation with all test methods
