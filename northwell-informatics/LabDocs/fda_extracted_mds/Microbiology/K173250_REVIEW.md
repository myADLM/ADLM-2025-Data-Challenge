# I. Device Description:

The Solana GBS Assay is an in vitro diagnostic, real-time DNA amplification test for the direct, qualitative detection of Group A Streptococcus DNA in vaginal/rectal swab specimens that have been incubated for 18-24 hours in enrichment broth.

The assay kit comprises pre-filled tubes containing Process Buffer that are used for specimen processing, and separate Reaction Tubes that contain lyophilized reagents for HelicaseDependent Amplification and fluorescence-based detection of the target nucleic acid and a Process Control.

After incubation of a vaginal/rectal swab specimen in Lim or Carrot broth, a portion of the culture medium is transferred to a Process Buffer tube that is heated at $9 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 5 minutes to lyse the target organisms (if present). An aliquot of the lysate is then used to rehydrate the contents of a Reaction Tube which is placed in the Solana instrument for nucleic acid amplification, detection and automated result interpretation.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not applicable

# L. Test Principle:

The Solana GBS Assay uses Helicase-Dependent Amplification with fluorescently-labeled probes to detect a conserved region of the S. agalactiae thiolase atoB gene in culture medium from vaginal/rectal swabs that are obtained from pregnant women.

Vaginal/rectal swab specimens are cultured for 18-24 hours in either Lim or Carrot broth, after which a sample of the culture medium is transferred to a tube containing Process Buffer. The tube is heated at $9 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 5 minutes to lyse the target organisms, and an aliquot of the lysate is used to rehydrate Reaction Tubes that contain reagents for the amplification and detection of S. agalactiae target DNA and an internal Process Control. After rehydration, the test operator loads the Reaction Tubes into the Solana instrument for automated incubation, fluorescence detection and result interpretation. Results are reported on the instrument screen as “GBS Positive,” “GBS Negative” or “Invalid” (due to Process Control failure) and may be printed.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# 1. Analytical performance:

Analytical studies to characterize the performance of the Solana GBS Assay were conducted using Lim or Carrot broth that was inoculated with clinical vaginal/rectal swab matrix, incubated for 18-24 hours at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , screened as GBS-negative using the Solana GBS Assay, pooled and stored frozen at ${ \le } { - } 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Samples for testing were prepared by mixing an aliquot of the vaginal/rectal swab culture medium with enumerated stock suspensions of S. agalactiae, Solana GBS Assay Process Buffer and other components appropriate to the conditions under investigation.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

# Reproducibility

The reproducibility of the Solana GBS Assay between laboratories was evaluated in a study performed by two operators at each of three sites over a period of five nonconsecutive days. The Solana GBS Assay exhibited similar analytical sensitivity with Lim and Carrot broth samples and therefore the Reproducibility Study was performed with a panel of contrived positive and negative Lim broth samples as the representative sample type (refer to Sections $\mathbf { M } ( \mathbf { 1 } ) ( \mathbf { d } )$ and M(2)(b)). The positive samples were prepared using two strains of GBS at three different target levels based on the limit of detection of the assay. On each day, each operator tested three negative samples and one or two replicates of each S. agalactiae positive panel member (3 sites $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ operators x 5 days x 2-4 samples per target level per day $= 9 0$ replicates per target level). The results of the study are summarized in Table 1.

NA: Not applicable; LoD: Limit of Detection

In addition to testing the reproducibility panel members, on each day of the study, the operators each tested three Positive and three Negative External Controls (3 sites $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ operators x 3 replicates $\mathrm { ~ x ~ } 5 ~ \mathrm { d a y s } = 9 0$ replicates per control). The controls were prepared using the Quidel Molecular GBS Control Set. In all cases the Positive and Negative External Controls produced the expected results $( 9 0 / 9 0 = 1 0 0 \% )$ ).

The results of this study demonstrated acceptable reproducibility from site-to-site at target levels close to the limit of detection (LoD) of the Solana GBS assay.

# Repeatability

The within-laboratory repeatability of the Solana GBS Assay was evaluated by testing a panel of contrived positive and negative Lim broth samples over a period of 15 non-consecutive days. The positive samples were prepared using two strains of GBS at three different target levels. On each day, six negative samples and either two or four replicates of each positive panel member were tested (15 days x 2 strains $\tt { x } 2 { - } 4$ replicates per panel member $= 9 0$ replicates per target level). The results of the study are summarized in Table 2.

In addition to testing the panel members, on each day of the Repeatability Study, six Positive and six Negative External Controls were also tested (6 replicates $\mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 5 ~ \mathrm { d a y s } = 9 0$ replicates per control). The controls were prepared using the Quidel Molecular GBS Control Set. In all cases the Positive and Negative Controls produced the expected results $( 9 0 / 9 0 = 1 0 0 \%$ ).

The Solana GBS Assay demonstrated acceptable repeatability between days.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Sample Stability

Studies were conducted to evaluate the stability of samples of vaginal/rectal swab culture matrix prior to addition to the Process Buffer. Testing was performed using Lim and Carrot broth vaginal/rectal swab culture matrix that was seeded with $S$ . agalactiae strain ATCC BAA-611 at 2X LoD (Section M(1)(d)). Enrichment cultures in both Lim and Carrot broth were shown to be stable for up to 48 hours at $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or 7 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Following addition to Process Buffer, samples stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ were found to be stable for up to 72 hours prior to or after heat lysis.

# Process Control

The Solana GBS Assay Process Buffer Tube contains a Process Control that is designed to monitor sample processing and the presence of substances that are inhibitory to DNA amplification, as well as reagent or instrument failure. Specimens that are negative for S. agalactiae by the Solana GBS Assay and in which the Process Control is also not detected are reported as “Invalid” and should be retested from the processed sample. If an Invalid result is obtained upon retesting, another aliquot of the same broth culture should be processed or a new enrichment culture should be prepared.

# External Controls

External Controls should be tested according to guidelines or requirements of local, provincial and/or federal regulations or accreditation organizations. External Positive and Negative Controls should be processed in the same manner as patient specimens to monitor for substantial reagent or instrument failure.

Positive and Negative External Controls from the Quidel Molecular GBS Control Set were tested on each day that patient specimens were evaluated during the prospective Clinical Study described in Section M(3)(a). A total of 52 pairs of Positive and Negative Controls were tested during the study, all of which $( 1 0 0 \% )$ produced the expected results.

Additional Positive and Negative External Controls were also tested during the Reproducibility and Repeatability Studies and in all cases produced the expected results (refer to Section M(1)(a)).

# d. Detection Limit:

# Limit of Detection

The LoD of the Solana GBS Assay was determined for six strains of S. agalactiae using contrived Lim broth-enriched vaginal/rectal samples that were seeded with $S .$ . agalactiae cells at different concentrations. Initial testing was performed with a single lot of Solana GBS Assay reagents. The preliminary LoD for each strain was defined as the lowest concentration at which ${ \geq } 1 9 / 2 0 $ replicates produced a positive result. The preliminary LoD was confirmed by testing two additional lots of Solana GBS Assay reagents at the estimated LoD target level. For the LoD for each strain to be confirmed ${ \geq } 1 9 / 2 0 $ replicates with each reagent lot had to produce positive results. The results of the study are summarized in Table 3.

The highest LoD among the six strains of S. agalactiae tested was for strain ATCC 12403 at $2 . 6 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ . The LoD for this strain was shown to be the same in the presence of contrived Lim and Carrot broth-enriched vaginal/rectal swab matrices, demonstrating that the analytical sensitivity of the Solana GBS Assay is independent of the type of broth culture medium used.

# Inclusivity (Analytical Reactivity)

The inclusivity of the Solana GBS Assay was evaluated by testing 14 different strains of S. agalactiae in addition to those included in the LoD Study (Table 4). Each strain was tested in triplicate in Lim broth cultured vaginal/rectal swab matrix at the claimed LoD target level $( 2 . 6 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ of culture medium). All the replicates of each of strain produced positive results. These results are acceptable.

# Bioinformatic Analysis

The inclusivity of the Solana GBS Assay primers and probes for the detection of GBS was analyzed in silico using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST).

Overall, the region was shown to be highly conserved. One strain of $S .$ . agalactiae was found to have a single mismatch near the middle of the reverse primer, although this is not predicted to have an adverse effect of amplification/detection. These results are acceptable.

# e. Analytical specificity:

# Cross-reactivity Study

The analytical specificity of the Solana GBS Assay was evaluated by testing a panel of 97 organisms and viruses that may be found in vaginal/rectal specimens, as well as human DNA (Table 5). Three replicates of each potentially cross-reactive organism or virus were prepared using Lim broth vaginal/rectal swab culture matrix. Bacteria and yeast species were tested at $1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ of vaginal/rectal swab culture medium, while viruses were tested at $1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ . No false positive or Invalid results were obtained. These results are acceptable.

# Bioinformatic Analysis

In silico analysis using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) was performed to evaluate the potential for cross-reaction of the Solana GBS Assay primers and probes with non-target organisms. No significant similarity was observed between the Solana atoB amplicon, primers or probes and sequences from other species. These results are acceptable.

# Contamination Study

The potential for false-positive results with the Solana GBS Assay due to within run or between run cross-contamination was evaluated by testing an alternating series of $S$ . agalactiae “high positive” and negative samples in successive instrument runs, in addition to Positive and Negative External Controls. The high positive samples contained S. agalactiae at a concentration of $1 . 8 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ of Lim broth vaginal/rectal matrix. Negative samples comprised simulated throat swab matrix alone. The expected results were obtained for all S. agalactiae positive and negative samples (50/50 each). Each of the Positive and Negative External Controls also produced the expected results (10/10 each). These results are acceptable.

# f. Assay cut-off:

The algorithm parameters for the Solana GBS Assay were established through analysis of fluorescence amplification curves obtained from testing known GBS positive and negative samples on the Solana Instrument. The cut-offs were chosen to

optimize sensitivity for detection of GBS and minimize Invalid test results due to failure of the Process Control.

# g. Assay interference:

Potentially Interfering Substances

The potential for interference with the Solana GBS Assay was evaluated with endogenous and exogenous substances that may be present in vaginal/rectal swab specimens (Table 6). Each substance was tested in triplicate in the presence and absence of S. agalactiae at 2X LoD $( 5 . 2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L } )$ ) using samples prepared with Lim broth-enriched vaginal/rectal matrix. No false positive, false negative or Invalid test results were observed under any of the conditions tested. These results are acceptable.

# Microbial Interference

The potential for interference with the Solana GBS Assay by organisms and viruses that may be present in vaginal/rectal swab specimens was evaluated using the same list of species that were evaluated for potential cross-reactivity (Section M(1)(e); Table 5). Testing was performed by mixing each potentially interfering organism or virus with $S .$ agalactiae strain ATCC 12403 at a concentration of 2X LoD in Process Buffer containing Lim broth-enriched vaginal/rectal swab matrix. For bacteria and yeasts, the final concentrations were $1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { \bar { C F U / m L } }$ , while viruses were tested at $1 0 ^ { 5 }$ $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ (except as noted in Table 5). No false negative or Invalid results were obtained with any of the organisms or viruses tested. These results are acceptable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable.

b. Matrix comparison:

The LoD of the Solana GBS Assay was initially established using samples prepared with matrix derived from Lim broth vaginal/rectal swab cultures. The claimed LoD was subsequently confirmed by testing samples prepared in matrix derived from Carrot broth vaginal/rectal swab cultures. Refer to Section M(1)(d). Additional studies also demonstrated that equivalent Solana GBS Assay results are obtained with Lim and Carrot broth cultures that are incubated for 18 or 24 hours.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity:

The performance of the Solana GBS Assay was evaluated in a prospective Clinical Study that was performed at four (4) sites in the U.S. Vaginal/rectal swab specimens were obtained from a total of 753 pregnant women at between 35 and 37 weeks of gestation. The age of the subjects ranged from 15 to 44 years old. The specimens were inoculated into either Lim broth (403) or Carrot broth (350) and incubated for between 18 and 24 hours at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ after which the cultures were tested using the Solana GBS Assay and the results were compared to those obtained from subculture of the broth to blood agar, followed by Gram staining of suspected colonies of S. agalactiae, catalase testing (S. agalactiae is catalase negative) and latex agglutination using GBS-specific reagents. The results of the study are summarized in Table 7. One specimen produced repeated Invalid results with the Solana assay and was excluded from the analysis of performance.
