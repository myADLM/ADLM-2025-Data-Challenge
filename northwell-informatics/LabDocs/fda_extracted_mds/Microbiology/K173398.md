Microbiology (83)

Prescription Use Yes Predicate Device IQuum Roche Liat™ Strep A Assay Assay: [510(k) #K141338]

Device Description:

The Xpert Xpress Strep A test is an automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in vitro diagnostic test for qualitative detection of Streptococcus pyogenes from throat swab specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of pharyngitis.

The Xpert Xpress Strep A test is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert® Xpress System. The GeneXpert Xpress System platform automates sample preparation, amplification and real-time detection.

The GeneXpert Xpress System requires the use of single-use, disposable cartridges (the Xpert Xpress Strep A cartridges) that hold the PCR reagents and host the PCR process. Because the cartridges are self-contained and specimens never come into contact with working parts of the instrument modules, cross-contamination between samples is minimized.

The Xpress Strep A test includes primers and probes for the detection of a targeted sequence of the S. pyogenes genome allowing detection of Strep A directly from throat swab specimens collected from patients with signs and symptoms of pharyngitis. A Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) are internal controls utilized by the GeneXpert Xpress System platform. The SPC is present to control for adequate processing of the target bacteria and to monitor for the presence of inhibitor(s) in the PCR assay to avoid false-negative results. The Probe Check Control verifies reagent rehydration, real-time PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability.

The single-use, multi-chambered fluidic cartridges are designed to complete sample preparation and real-time PCR for the detection of genomic DNA S. pyogenes in ${ \sim } 2 4$ minutes or less. The GeneXpert Xpress System, comprised of the GeneXpert Xpress II and GeneXpert Xpress IV, is capable of performing separate sample preparation and realtime PCR and RT-PCR tests. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids (i.e., the syringe drive activates the plunger that works in concert with the rotary valve in the cartridge to move fluids between chambers), an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or spores, and a proprietary $\mathrm { I - C O R E } ^ { \textregistered }$ thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and RTPCR and detection.

Throat swab specimens are collected using the ESwab collection device and transported to the GeneXpert area and prepared according to package insert instructions. After mixing the specimen, the liquid sample is transferred to the Xpert Xpress Strep A cartridge. The user initiates a test from the system user interface and places the cartridge into the GeneXpert Xpress instrument platform, which performs hands-off real-time, multiplex PCR for detection of DNA. The results are automatically generated at the end of the process in a report that can be viewed and printed.

# Device Intended Use:

The Xpert® Xpress Strep A test, performed on the GeneXpert Xpress System, is a rapid, qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the detection of Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A $\beta \mathrm { . }$ -hemolytic Streptococcus, Strep A) in throat swab specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of pharyngitis. The Xpert Xpress Strep A test can be used as an aid in the diagnosis of Group A Streptococcal pharyngitis. The assay is not intended to monitor treatment for Group A Streptococcus infections.

The Xpert Xpress Strep A test utilizes an automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect Streptococcus pyogenes DNA.

# Substantial Equivalence:

The Xpert Xpress Strep A test is substantially equivalent to the Roche Liat Strep A Assay [510(k) # K141338]. The performance of the Xpert Xpress Strep A test was evaluated in a multi-site clinical study in which the performance of Xpert Xpress Strep A was determined relative to culture. The results of the study demonstrated that the performance of Xpert Xpress Strep A is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

Table 8-1 shows the similarities and differences between Xpert Xpress Strep A and the predicate device.

The Xpert Xpress Strep A test has the same general intended use as the predicate device and has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device. The differences between Xpert Xpress Strep A and the predicate device do not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness. The clinical study demonstrates that the Xpert Xpress Strep A test is acceptable for its intended use with inexperienced lab users and is substantially equivalent to the predicate device described above.

# Non-Clinical Studies:

# Analytical Sensitivity (Limit of Detection)

Studies were performed to determine the analytical sensitivity or Limit of Detection (LoD) of the Xpert Xpress Strep A using the ESwab collection kit. The limit of detection is the lowest concentration of sample (reported as CFU/mL in ESwab transport medium or CFU/test) that can be reproducibly distinguished from negative samples $9 5 \%$ of the time, or the lowest concentration of organisms at which 19 of 20 replicates were positive. This study determined the lowest concentration of Streptococcus pyogenes cells diluted into pooled clinical throat swab matrix that can be detected using the Xpert Xpress Strep A.

The analytical sensitivity of the Xpert Xpress Strep A was performed using two lots of reagents tested across three testing days with two Streptococcus pyogenes strains: ATCC BAA-946 and ATCC 19615.

The claimed LoD for each Strep A strain tested is summarized in Table 8-2.

# Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)

Twenty-four Streptococcus pyogenes strains were tested at 3X LoD using the Xpert Xpress Strep A in replicates of three. The strains tested included representative isolates of emm types 1, 3, 4, 6, 11, 12, 18, 22, 25, 27, 38, 75, 77, 89, 94, 95. The list of strains tested in ESwab medium containing simulated throat swab matrix is shown in Table 8-3. All 24 strains were correctly reported as Strep A DETECTED with the Xpert Xpress Strep A.

# Analytical Specificity (Exclusivity)

The analytical specificity of the Xpert Xpress Strep A was evaluated by testing a panel of 70 potentially cross-reactive microorganisms, including species that are phylogenetically related to Streptococcus pyogenes and members of the throat commensal microflora (e.g., other bacteria, viruses, and yeast). The 70 organisms tested were identified as either Gram-positive (27), Gram-negative (33), or Gram-indeterminate (3), yeast (1), and viruses (6). Streptococcus Group B, Streptococcus Group C, and Streptococcus Group G strains were also included in this study. All strains were tested in triplicate in ESwab transport medium containing simulated throat swab matrix at ${ \geq } 1 0 ^ { ^ { 6 } }$ CFU/mL for bacteria and yeast and $\geq 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ for viruses. All three replicates of all 70 organisms were reported as Strep A NOT DETECTED by the Xpert Xpress Strep A (Table 8-4). The analytical specificity of the Xpert Xpress Strep A was $100 \%$ .

# Microbial Interference

An interfering microorganism study was performed to assess the inhibitory effects of commensal microorganisms in throat swab samples on the performance of the Xpert Xpress Strep A. Twenty-seven microorganisms were tested for potential interference with Strep A detection (Table 8-5). The microorganisms were tested at $\geq 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ in the presence of Strep A at 3X LoD concentration in ESwab medium containing simulated throat swab matrix. The results showed that the presence of the tested microorganisms did not interfere with the detection of Strep A target DNA.

# Potentially Interfering Substances Study

Ten potentially interfering substances that may be present in clinical throat specimens with the potential to interfere with the performance of the Xpert Xpress Strep A were evaluated. The potentially interfering substances included blood, mucus, human saliva, sugarcontaining cold and flu remedies, cough medicine, antiseptic, salt-modifying remedies, pHmodifying remedies, antacids, and foods or drinks that increase salivary viscosity. The substances, active ingredients, and concentrations tested are listed in Table 8-6. Medically and/or physiologically relevant concentrations of potential interferents were tested in simulated throat swab matrix in the presence and absence of Strep A at 3X LoD.

There was no assay interference in the presence of the substances at the concentrations tested in this study. All positive and negative samples were correctly identified using the Xpert Xpress Strep A.

# Carry-Over Contamination

A study was conducted to demonstrate that single-use, self-contained GeneXpert cartridges prevent specimen and amplicon carry-over contamination from very high titer positive samples (S. pyogenes) into successively run negative samples when processed in the same GeneXpert module. The study consisted of a negative sample processed in the same GeneXpert module immediately after processing a very high titer positive sample at a concentration $\geq 1 \mathrm { X } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ in ESwab transport medium containing simulated throat swab matrix. The testing scheme was repeated 40 times between 2 GeneXpert instruments (one module per instrument) for a total of 41 runs per instrument (20 high positive samples per instrument and 21 negative samples per instrument). There was no evidence of any carry-over contamination. All 42 negative samples were correctly

Not applicable, the Xpert Xpress Strep A test is a qualitative assay.

Clinical Studies

# Clinical Performance

A prospective, multi-center investigational study was conducted to evaluate the clinical performance of the Xpert Xpress Strep A. An initial throat swab was collected for the standard of care method and a second throat swab was collected from consented subjects for testing by the Xpert Xpress Strep A and reference method. The specimens were collected using ESwabs (flocked swab in Liquid Amies medium) from patients presenting with signs and symptoms of pharyngitis. The Xpert Xpress Strep A test was evaluated at nine clinical sites from geographically diverse regions within the United States between January 2017 and May 2017.

Six hundred sixty-six (666) specimens were initially enrolled in the study. Of these, 43 were excluded from the analysis due to failure to comply with the inclusion criteria (11), delay in shipment (27), reference method indeterminate (4) or incorrect specimen type (1).

Among the 623 specimens included in the analysis, $9 4 . 7 \%$ (590/623) were successful on the initial test and $9 9 . 2 \%$ (618/623) upon retest.

The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the Xpert Xpress Strep A were established relative to culture and latex agglutination for Strep A typing. The overall performance of the Xpert Xpress Strep A is presented in Table 8-7. Discordant results between Xpert Xpress Strep A and culture were investigated using an alternative PCR/bidirectional sequencing assay; the results of which are footnoted in Table 8-7.

b. Results from alternative PCR with bidirectional sequencing: 1 of 1 was Strep A Negative.   
c. On initial testing, 33/623 specimens $( 5 . 3 \% )$ produced indeterminate results; 31/33 were retested, of which 28 produced valid results that were included in the analysis of performance for a final indeterminate rate of 5/623 $( 0 . 8 \% )$ .

# Reproducibility Study

A four member reproducibility panel with varying concentrations of Streptococcus pyogenes was tested two times per day on five different days by three different operators at three sites (4 specimens $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ times/day x 5 days x 3 operators $_ { \textrm { X 3 } }$ sites). Three lots of Xpert Xpress Strep A cartridges were used. The samples were prepared in simulated throat swab matrix at the different concentration levels and are presented in Table 8-8. Results of the reproducibility study are summarized in Table 8-9 by study site/operator.
