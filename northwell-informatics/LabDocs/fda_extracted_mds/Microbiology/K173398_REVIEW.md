# I. Device Description:

The Cepheid Xpert Xpress Strep A test is an automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in vitro diagnostic test for qualitative detection of Streptococcus pyogenes DNA directly from throat swab specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of pharyngitis.

Throat swab specimen are collected using the Copan Liquid Amies Elution Swab (ESwab) collection medium. The sample is mixed by shaking and 300ul of is added to the Xpert Xpress Strep A cartridge using a disposable transfer pipette. Once the cartridge is loaded into a GeneXpert Xpress module and the test is initiated by the operator, all the steps associated with sample processing, PCR amplification/detection and result interpretation occur automatically.

The Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert Xpress System that automates sample preparation, DNA amplification and real-time detection in single-use, disposable cartridges.

The Xpert Xpress Strep A test cartridge contains a pair of PCR primers and a hydrolysis probe that enable detection of a conserved DNA sequence within the S. pyogenes genome. The assay also incorporates a Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) to monitor the integrity of the reagents and process workflow.

The GeneXpert Xpress System, which uses the GeneXpert Xpress II and IV instruments, performs separate sample preparation and real-time PCR and RT-PCR tests. Each module contains a syringe pump drive for dispensing fluids, an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells, a valve drive that rotates the cartridge valve body to address the different cartridge chambers for sample movement, and a thermocycler unit for performing real-time PCR and RT-PCR and detection.

The Xpert Xpress Strep A results are interpreted by the GeneXpert Xpress software from measured fluorescent signals and are shown in the “Test Result” screen. The final result report can be viewed on-screen and/or printed.

The single-use, multi-chambered fluidic cartridges are designed to complete sample preparation and real-time PCR for the detection of genomic DNA S. pyogenes in approximately 24 minutes or less.

# L. Test Principle:

The Xpert Xpress Strep A is performed on the GeneXpert XpressSystem (GeneXpert Xpress II and IV instruments) that automate nucleic acid extraction, amplification and detection in single-use, disposable cartridges. Each cartridge contains primers and probes for detection of the targeted region of the S. pyogenes chromosome (if present) and a Sample Processing Control (SPC). The SPC and a separate Probe Check Control (PCC) are used by the GeneXpert systems to monitor reagent and process integrity.

Throat swab specimens for testing with the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay are collected using the Copan Liquid Amies Elution Swab (ESwab) Collection and Transport System. Upon receipt in the testing laboratory, the ESwab tube is mixed by shaking and $3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the transport medium is added to an Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay cartridge using a disposable transfer pipette. The operator then initiates the test from the operator interface and loads the cartridge into the GeneXpert instrument, after which all process steps are performed automatically.

Once complete, the final result report can be viewed on-screen and/or printed. Results are reported as Strep A DETECTED, Strep A NOT DETECTED, , INSTRUMENT ERROR or NO RESULT-REPEAT TEST (If the result is NO RESULT-REPEAT TEST, then retest with a new cartridge. If the retest is NO RESULT-REPEAT TEST, call Cepheid Technical Support).). Instructions for retesting are provided for samples with indeterminate results.

The Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay has an Early Termination Feature whereby results for samples that are strongly positive for S. pyogenes are reported prior to completion of the full number of PCR cycles designated in the assay definition file.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# 1. Analytical performance:

Analytical studies for the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay were described in submission K172126 that was cleared on September 25, 2017. All testing was performed using the same assay in this submission. No changes have been made to the design of the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay since the 510(k) clearance of K172126. For this submission the data from all analytical studies (except Reproducibility study) is identical to those conducted in support of K172126 clearance. All analytical data was generated with GeneXpert Dx software using the GeneXpert Dx (GX-IV and GX-XVI) instrument and reanalyzed with GeneXpert Xpress software 5.0 The data re-analyzed with GeneXpert Xpress software 5.0 provided identical results to those original analysis with GeneXpert Dx software 4.7b.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A multi-center study was conducted at three sites with three operators at each site. Each operator tested four-member panel comprised of positive samples with varying concentrations of Streptoccoccus pyogenes ATCC BAA-946 at three target concentrations levels and a negative sample (No Streptococcus pyogenes) in a liquid Amies media containing simulated throat swab matrix (Table 2). Each operator tested blinded panel twice per day over 5 testing days ( 3 operators $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ times/day x 5 days x 3 sites $_ { - 9 0 }$ results). Three lots of Xpress Strep A Assay reagent were used in this study but only two lots of reagents were used at each testing site. All sites used the GeneXpert Xpress IV instrument. Samples were stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until testing The data was generated with Xpress software $4 . 7 \mathrm { c }$ and re-analyzed with GeneXpert $\mathrm { D x } 5 . 0$ software. The Reproducibility data re-analysis, with GeneXpert $\mathrm { D x } 5 . 0$ software provided results identical to the original analysis, with GeneXpert Xpress software 4.7c. A summary of the reproducibility panel members is outlined in Table2.

3. Clinical Studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:

The performance of the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay was conducted at a total of nine (9) clinical sites in the U.S. that were selected to be representative of the CLIA Waived testing environment (including emergency departments, urgent care centers, physician’s offices and a walk-in clinic). The GeneXpert Operators who performed the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay at each site were non-laboratory healthcare personnel, with no experience with either the Cepheid CW or moderately complex assays.

Throat swab specimen were prospectively collected in Liquid Amies medium (ESwab) from consented subjects presenting signs and symptoms of pharyngitis following collection of standard of care (SOC) swab specimens. Specimen were stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until all testing was completed. The performance of the Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay was determined relative to the reference culture. Xpert Xpress Strep A Assay testing and the reference culture method were performed within 48 hours of specimen collection. Isolated colonies that exhibited $\beta$ -hemolysis were typed by latex agglutination (Remel Streptex). Culture plates that did not exhibit $\beta$ -hemolytic colonies after 48 hours were recorded as negative for Group A Streptococcus. The study was performed with the GeneXpert Xpress system (GeneXpert II and IV instrument). The data was generated with GeneXpert Xpress software $4 . 7 \mathrm { c }$ and reanalyzed with GeneXpert Xpress software 5.0.

A total of 666 specimens were collected from individual subjects initially enrolled in this clinical study. Of the 666 specimen, 43 specimen were excluded because of: lack of consent documents (10), previously enrolled subject (1), delay in shipment for reference culture testing (27), indeterminate culture results (4), and incorrect specimen type (1).Of the 623 eligible specimens, $4 . 7 \%$ (29/623) produced “NO RESULT-REPEAT TEST” and $0 . 6 \%$ (4/623) produced an “INSTRUMENT ERROR” with the Xpert Xpress Strep A test. Twenty eight out of twenty nine samples with NO RESULT-REPEAT test were retested and twenty five samples yielded valid results. Three out of four samples with INSTRUMENT ERROR were retested and three samples have yielded valid results. A total of 618 specimens were therefore included in the final evaluable data for analysis of performance. Specimens were prospectively collected.
