Simplexa™ Bordetella Direct MOL2750   
The DiaSorin Molecular Simplexa™ Bordetella Direct MOL2750 assay is an in vitro diagnostic test intended for use on the LIAISON $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ MDX instrument for the qualitative detection and differentiation of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis nucleic acids from frozen nasopharyngeal (NPS) specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of Bordetella infection of the respiratory tract.

The Simplexa™ Bordetella Direct MOL2750 assay is performed on the LIAISON $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ MDX instrument and utilizes realtime PCR amplification to detect $B _ { \cdot }$ . pertussis by targeting the IS481 insertional element of the $B$ . pertussis genome and to detect B. parapertussis by targeting the IS1001 insertional element of the $B$ . parapertussis genome. The IS481 insertional element can also be present in B. holmesii and B. bronchiseptica. Specimens collected from patients with respiratory infection caused by $B$ . pertussis, B. holmesii or B. bronchiseptica may yield positive test results in IS481 assays. B.

holmesii infection may cause clinical illness similar to $B$ . pertussis, and mixed outbreaks involving both $B$ . pertussis and B. holmesii infection have been reported. Additional testing should be performed if necessary to differentiate $B$ . holmesii and $B$ . pertussis. B. bronchiseptica is a rare cause of infection in humans. When clinical factors suggest that $B$ . pertussis may not be the cause of respiratory infection, other clinically appropriate investigation(s) should be carried out in accordance with published guidelines.

Negative results for the Simplexa™ Bordetella Direct MOL2750 assay do not preclude Bordetella infection and positive results do not rule out co-infection with other respiratory pathogens. Results from the Simplexa™ Bordetella Direct MOL2750 assay should be used with other clinical findings and epidemiological information as an aid in diagnosis of Bordetella infection. Test results should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.

# Device Description

The Simplexa™ Bordetella Direct assay system is a real-time PCR assay that enables the direct amplification, detection and differentiation of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis DNA from unprocessed nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) without nucleic acid extraction. The system consists of the

Simplexa™ Bordetella Direct assay, the LIAISON® MDX (with LIAISON® MDX Studio Software), the Direct Amplification Disc and associated accessories.

In the Simplexa™ Bordetella Direct assay, primers and fluorescent probes are used together to amplify and detect Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis and internal control targets. Insertion sequences IS481 and IS1001 are targeted to identify Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis DNA respectively in the specimen. An internal control is used to detect PCR failure and/or inhibition.

The DiaSorin Molecular Simplexa™ Bordetella Direct kit contains sufficient reagents for 24 reactions. Upon receipt, store at $^ { - 1 0 }$ to $\mathfrak { - 3 0 \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (do not use a frost-free freezer). Each vial contains sufficient material for a single reaction. Use within 30 minutes of thawing.

# METHOD COMPARISON

One thousand one hundred and forty-two (1142) samples were prospectively collected and frozen from five (5) geographically diverse sites between January 2017 and August 2017, from patients with signs and symptoms of Bordetella infections. Of the one thousand one hundred and forty-two (1142) samples, one thousand one hundred and thirteen (1113) samples were evaluable on Simplexa™ Bordetella Direct and a composite reference method. In addition, fifty-six (56) samples were contrived for Bordetella parapertussis at various concentrations across the clinical range of the assay (2-50 X LoD) and randomized among fifty-six (56) negatives for a total of one hundred and twelve (112) additional samples, which were evaluable on Simplexa™ Bordetella Direct and a composite reference method. The composite reference method consisted of two well-characterized real-time PCR assays followed by confirmation of positive PCR amplification products with bi-directional sequencing, per target. Samples were characterized as positive if one or both composite reference methods were positive and confirmed by bi-directional sequencing. Samples were characterized as negative if both composite reference methods were negative. Samples were tested on Simplexa™ Bordetella Direct at the collection sites and the composite reference method was performed at DiaSorin Molecular. The Bordetella pertussis prospectively banked frozen sample results are shown in Table 1. The Bordetella parapertussis prospectively banked frozen sample results are shown in Table 2 and the Bordetella parapertussis contrived sample results are shown in Table 3.

# REPRODUCIBILITY

Three (3) investigative laboratory testing sites assessed the device's inter-site, inter-day and inter/intraassay reproducibility. Each of the laboratories tested a panel of six (6) members that included contrived Bordetella pertussis A639, and Bordetella parapertussis A747 samples at the following concentrations; low positive (LP) approximately 1-2 X LoD and a medium positive sample (MP) approximately $3 – 4 \times \mathsf { L o D }$ . A positive and negative control was also included in the panel. Each sample panel member was tested in triplicate per run for two (2) runs per day for five (5) non-consecutive days per site. Two (2) runs per day were each performed by a different operator. In total ninety (90) replicates (3 replicates X 2 runs X 5 days X 3 sites) were tested for each sample panel member. Combined results for all sites are presented in Table 4. The data in Table 4 show that the Simplexa™ Bordetella Direct is $100 \%$ in agreement with the expected results demonstrating the reproducibility of the assay for both Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis targets.

# ANALYTICAL SENSITIVITY/LIMIT OF DETECTION

The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined for the Simplexa™ Bordetella Direct assay using quantified stocks of two (2) strains of Bordetella pertussis (A639 & BAA-589) and Bordetella parapertussis (A747 & E595) serially diluted into native negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix in Universal Transport Media (UTM). LoD is the lowest concentration that could be detected as positive $\ge 9 5 \%$ of the time. The LoD concentrations for the Bordetella strains are summarized in Table 5.

# ANALYTICAL REACTIVITY / CROSS REACTIVITY

# Analytical Reactivity

Analytical Reactivity for Simplexa™ Bordetella Direct was assessed using eighteen (18) Bordetella strains including twelve (12) Bordetella pertussis strains and six (6) Bordetella parapertussis strains that were not tested as a part of the Limit of Detection (LoD) study. All eighteen (18) strains were detected as positive for Bordetella pertussis at or below 80 CFU/mL or for Bordetella parapertussis at or below 590 CFU/mL. In addition to the strains that were tested, in silico BLAST analysis demonstrated that the assay should detect at least two hundred and ninety-four (294) additional Bordetella pertussis and five (5) additional Bordetella parapertussis strains. The results of the testing are summarized in Table 6 for Bordetella pertussis and in Table 7 for Bordetella parapertussis.

# Cross Reactivity (Analytical Specificity)

Analytical specificity was evaluated for the Simplexa™ Bordetella Direct by testing cross reactivity to organisms that are closely related, or cause similar clinical symptoms, or are present as normal flora in the nasopharynx. Negative specimens were spiked with potentially cross reactive organisms at the concentrations indicated in Table 8. The spiked specimens were examined for reactivity with Simplexa™ Bordetella Direct. Ninety-seven (97) organisms were tested. No cross reactivity was found with the exception of Bordetella holmseii which was expected due to the presence of the IS481 element in Bordetella holmesii. The results are shown in Table 8.

\* The initial three (3) replicates of Rifampicin at $5 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ were valid but not detected for Bordetella parapertussus. An additional five (5) replicates were performed with no interference for Bordetella parapertussis at $5 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ .

# COMPETITIVE INTERFERENCE

The Simplexa™ Bordetella Direct assay was evaluated for competitive interference by testing whether the presence of a clinically relevant high concentration of either Bordetella pertussis or Bordetella parapertussis could affect the detection of the other Bordetella species when present at a low level. A low positive sample was contrived for each target by spiking Bordetella pertussis or Bordetella parapertussis separately (at approximately 2 X LoD) into nasopharyngeal swab matrix in Universal Transport Media (UTM) and a baseline Ct was determined for each sample. High concentrations of the other Bordetella strain were then spiked into the low level sample and tested. No competitive interference was observed. The results showed that a low level of Bordetella pertussis was detected in the presence of a high level of Bordetella parapertussis; similarly, a low level of Bordetella parapertussis was detected in the presence of a high level of Bordetella pertussis. The results are shown in Table 11.

# INHIBITION BY OTHER MICROORGANISMS

Simplexa™ Bordetella Direct was tested for the ability to identify Bordetella when potentially inhibitory organisms were present. The panel of ninety-seven (97) potentially inhibitory organisms was individually spiked into a pool with a low concentration (approximately 2X LoD) of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis. The organisms were spiked into the matrix at the concentrations indicated in Table 12. Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis were tested separately (data not shown) and as a dual positive sample. Below are the results of the dual positive Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis sample in Table 12. No inhibitory effects were observed for Simplexa™ Bordetella Direct at the concentrations tested.
