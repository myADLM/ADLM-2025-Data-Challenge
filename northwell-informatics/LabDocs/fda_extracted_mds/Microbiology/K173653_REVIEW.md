Alere i Instrument

# I. Device Description:

Alere i Strep A 2 is a rapid, instrument-based isothermal assay for the qualitative detection of Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus) DNA in throat swab specimens from patients suspected of pharyngitis. Alere i Strep A 2 is performed on the Alere i Instrument and is comprised of the following single-use disposables:

Sample Receiver o Containing Elution Buffer for swab expression

Transfer Cartridge o For transfer of the eluted sample to the Test Base   
· Test Base o Consisting of two sealed reaction tubes, each containing a lyophilized reagent pellet; o One tube is for detection the S. pyogenes target, the other for an oligonucleotide Internal Control

Alere i Strep A was originally cleared under K141757. Alere i Strep A 2 includes various modifications to the original Alere i Strep A assay chemistry to improve clinical sensitivity and alleviate the need for culture confirmation of negative test results, as well as to improve manufacturability of the reagents.

The reaction tubes in the Test Base contain the reagents required for enzymatic lysis of S. pyogenes, and the subsequent amplification of the target nucleic acid and an Internal Control. Alere i Strep A 2 uses a pair of templates (similar to primers) and a strand displacing DNA polymerase to amplify the S. pyogenes target DNA and Internal Control. Detection of the amplified products occurs through hybridization of fluorescently labeled Molecular Beacon probes. Alere i Strep A 2 is performed within the confinement of the Test Base, and no other part of the Alere i Instrument is in contact with the sample during the amplification process, thereby reducing the risk of instrument contamination and sample carry-over between measurements.

To perform the assay, the Sample Receiver and Test Base are inserted into the Alere i Instrument. A throat swab is expressed in the Elution Buffer contained within the Sample Receiver and a Transfer Cartridge is used to move the specified volume of swab eluate to the Test Base to dissolve the lyophilized reagent pellets that contain the reagents for bacterial lysis and target amplification. Heating of the reaction tubes, mixing of reagents, fluorescent detection of the amplification products and result interpretation are performed automatically by the instrument.

Inactivated bacterial Positive and Negative External Controls for use with Alere i Strep A 2 are provided within the assay kit and are also available separately. The controls consist of swabs that are coated with enumerated suspensions of inactivated bacteria and dried. The Positive Control is comprised of S. pyogenes while the Negative Control is comprised of Group C Streptococcus.

# L. Test Principle:

Alere i Strep A 2 uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification for qualitative detection of Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus) DNA from throat swab specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of pharyngitis. Alere i Strep A 2 for use on the Alere i Instrument consists of the following components:

a) Sample Receiver: containing Elution Buffer;   
b) Transfer Cartridge: for transfer of an aliquot of the eluted sample to the Test Base;   
c) Test Base: comprised of two sealed reaction tubes, each containing a lyophilized reagent pellet; one tube is for detection of the S. pyogenes target (if present), the other tube is for detection of the Internal Control.

The reaction tubes in the Test Base contain the reagents required for enzymatic lysis of $S$ . pyogenes bacteria and amplification of the target nucleic acid and Internal Control. Isothermal amplification takes place using specific templates (similar to primers) that target a conserved region of the S. pyogenes genome. The same template primers are also used to amplify the oligonucleotide Internal Control. Detection of amplified products occurs through hybridization of fluorescently labeled Molecular Beacons that are specific to the intervening regions between the template primers on the Internal Control and S. pyogenes amplicons. Result interpretation is based upon the gradient and amplitude of the fluorescence curves for the S. pyogenes and Internal Control targets in their respective optical channels and comparison to the appropriate threshold values.

To perform the assay, the Sample Receiver and Test Base are inserted into the Alere i Instrument. A throat swab is then expressed in the Elution Buffer. The operator uses the Transfer Cartridge to transfer a portion of the expressed sample to the Test Base to dissolve the lyophilized reagent pellets and initiate cell lysis and DNA amplification. Heating, mixing and fluorescent detection are conducted automatically by the instrument. Results are displayed on the instrument screen and archived on-board together with the sample identification number and date and time of testing. Results may also be printed.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A study to evaluate the reproducibility of Alere i Strep A 2 was conducted at three sites, over a period of five days, with three operators per site. Swab samples for testing were prepared with throat swab matrix that was seeded with different levels of S. pyogenes strain ATCC 19615. The target levels tested included a true negative (no target), Low Positive (2X Limit of Detection (LoD) and Moderate Positive (3X LoD). On each day of testing, each operator tested a blinded panel consisting of two replicates of each target level, for a total of 90 data points per target level (5 days x 3 sites x 3 operators x 2 replicates $= 9 0$ replicates per target level). In total, 11 Alere i Instruments were included in the study, together with two lots each of the assay components (Sample Receiver, Test Base and Test Cartridge). All results were as expected (Table 1). The reproducibility of Alere i Strep A 2 was therefore considered acceptable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Internal Control

Alere i Strep A 2 contains an oligonucleotide Internal Control that is designed to monitor the amplification/detection process and reagent function. The Internal Control is lyophilized in one of the two reaction tubes in the Test Base and is amplified and detected separately from the S. pyogenes target (if present) using a different optical channel of the Alere i Instrument. The Internal Control must be amplified and detected for a negative assay result to be reported. For S. pyogenes positive samples in which target amplification occurs, the amplification of the Internal Control is ignored. If S. pyogenes DNA is not detected and the Internal Control fails to amplify the test result is reported as “Invalid”.

Positive and Negative Control Swabs

The Alere i Strep A 2 kit contains swabs for use as Positive and Negative Controls that should be tested when the assay is performed on an instrument for the first time, with each new shipment of reagents and by each new operator. Additional controls are available as a separate kit and may be tested as necessary to comply with Quality Control requirements. The Positive Control Swab is coated with inactivated Group A Streptococcus. The Negative Control Swab is coated with inactivated Group C Streptococcus.

During the prospective Clinical Study described in Section M(3)(a), Positive and Negative Control Swabs were run on each Alere i instrument on each day that clinical specimens were tested. The expected results were obtained from 730/749 $( 9 7 . 5 \% )$ Positive Control Swabs and 729/742 $( 9 8 . 2 \% )$ ) Negative Control Swabs.

Reagent Stability

Alere i Strep A 2 reagents and controls should be stored at $2 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until the expiration date shown on the outer packaging.

Specimen Stability

During the Clinical Study that was conducted to establish the performance of Alere i Strep A 2 (Section M(3)(a)), the majority of throat swab specimens (898/981, $9 1 . 5 \%$ ) were tested within 1 hour of collection. Those specimens not tested within 2 hours of collection were refrigerated at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and tested within 24 hours.

Specimen stability was demonstrated analytically using alternative types of collection swab that were seeded with throat swab matrix either with or without S. pyogenes, and stored for different durations prior to testing. Ten S. pyogenes positive $( \sim 3 \mathrm { X }$ LoD) and $1 0 S .$ pyogenes negative samples were tested at each time point after

storage at either $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or $2 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The sample storage conditions that were validated for each swab type are summarized in Table 2.

The analytical Specimen Stability Study also showed that rayon swabs and the BBL CultureSwab Liquid Stuart specimen collection and transport system are not compatible with Alere i Strep A 2 and should not be used. This is noted as a Limitation in the device labeling.

# d. Detection limit:

# Limit of Detection

The Limit of Detection (LoD) of Alere i Strep A 2 was estimated for two strains of $S .$ . pyogenes by testing various dilutions of enumerated cell stocks in throat swab matrix. The LoD for each strain was then confirmed by testing a further 20 replicates at the lowest target level that produced $100 \%$ positive results. The LoD was defined as the lowest concentration tested at which $2 9 5 \%$ of assay replicates produced positive results.

Target levels were determined by measuring the optical density of stock suspensions of $S .$ . pyogenes at $6 3 0 \mathrm { n m } \left( \mathrm { O D } _ { 6 3 0 } \right)$ and using a quantitative laboratory-developed PCR assay to estimate genomic equivalents. 1 Chamber counts performed by microscopy showed that an $\mathrm { O D } _ { 6 3 0 }$ of 0.1 was equivalent to $2 \mathrm { { x } 1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { { c e l l s } / \mathrm { { m L } } } }$ . The results of the study are shown in Table 3. The higher of the two LoD values expressed in terms of genomic copies was used as the basis for testing the inclusivity of Alere i Strep A 2 (Table 4).

ATCC: American Type Culture Collection; LoD: Limit of Detection 1 Level at which 10/10 assay replicates produced positive results; the lowest level tested was 1537 genomic copies $\mathrm { \Delta } ^ { \prime } \mathrm { m L }$ , approximately 3X the LoD determined for strain ATCC 19615 2 ${ \dot { < } } 1 0 / 1 0$ positive results were obtained at lower target levels

# Bioinformatic analysis:

The inclusivity of Alere i Strep A 2 assay was also assessed in silico by searching the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Nucleotide database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore) using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST), with the S. pyogenes amplicon sequence as the query sequence. The region of the S. pyogenes genome targeted by the assay was shown to be well conserved, with no evidence of sequence heterogeneity that could lead to false

negative results. This analysis supports the ability of Alere i Strep A 2 to detect different strains of S. pyogenes and is acceptable.

# e. Analytical specificity:

# Cross-Reactivity

The analytical specificity of Alere i Strep A 2 was evaluated by testing a variety of commensal and pathogenic species of bacteria and yeast (Table 5). Suspensions of each organism were diluted in phosphate buffered saline and tested in triplicate at a final concentration ${ \ge } 2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ cells/mL of Elution Buffer. All results were as expected and no evidence of cross-reaction or assay interference was observed.

# Bioinformatic Analysis

To evaluate the potential for cross-reaction of Alere i Strep A 2 with non-target organisms, BLAST analyses were performed against the NCBI Nucleotide database using the assay target region as the query sequence. The search showed no evidence of homology between the Alere i Strep A 2 target sequence and clinically relevant species that is likely to result in cross-reaction and generation of false-positive results.

# Contamination Study

The potential for contamination between samples tested on the same Alere i Instrument was assessed by testing an alternating series of Alere i Strep A (K141757) Positive and Negative Control Swabs. The Positive Control Swabs resulted in a final concentration of S. pyogenes of 1.5-2.5 CFU/mL of Elution Buffer while the Negative Controls delivered Group C Streptococcus at a concentration of $5 \mathrm { \times 1 0 ^ { 6 } C F U / m L }$ . Thirty 30 Positive and 30 Negative Control Swabs were tested on each of two Alere i Instruments (i.e., 60 Positive and 60 Negative Swabs in total). All the controls produced the expected results and no false positive results were observed, indicating that the risk of contamination between runs is acceptably low.

# f. Assay cut-off:

Alere i Strep A 2 is comprised of two separate amplification reactions that occur in separate tubes; one for the S. pyogenes target and one for the Internal Control. The products of each amplification reaction are detected in separate optical channels by monitoring the accumulation of fluorescent signal in real-time. The gradient and amplitude of the fluorescence curve generated in each optic are analyzed and used in a decision algorithm to determine the final assay result. Once a definitive result for a sample is obtained, the assay is terminated. The gradient thresholds (cut-offs) for the assay were established through analysis of known positive and negative samples and were validated in the Clinical Study described in Section M(3)(a).

# g. Assay Interference

The potential for interference with Alere i Strep A 2 was evaluated with 21 endogenous and exogenous substances that may be present in throat swab specimens. Each substance was tested in triplicate in the presence and absence of S. pyogenes ATCC 19615 at a concentration of 3X LoD (1537 genomic copies/mL of Elution Buffer). False negative results were obtained with both human saliva and mucin at concentrations of $1 0 \% \mathrm { v / v }$ and $2 \% \mathrm { w / v }$ , respectively. In addition, a false positive result was observed in the presence of Listerine Antiseptic Mouthwash at $2 0 \% \mathrm { v / v }$ . In each case, the expected results were obtained when the substances were tested at lower concentration. These results are reflected in the device labeling.

b. Matrix comparison:

The compatibility of alternative specimen collection and transport devices with Alere i Strep A 2 was demonstrated in the context of the Specimen Stability Studies described in Section M(1)(c).

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity:

The clinical performance of Alere i Strep A 2 was established in a multi-center, prospective Clinical Study that was conducted at nine (9) geographically diverse U.S. sites in 2017 among patients who presented with a sore throat or symptoms of pharyngitis. A total of 1028 subjects were initially enrolled in the study of whom 43 were excluded from the analysis of performance for the following reasons: error in sample handling (21), failure to meet eligibility criteria (11), failure to comply with informed consent procedures (11). Of the remaining subjects, 976/985 $( 9 9 . 1 \% )$ generated valid Alere i Strep A 2 results on initial testing (initial invalid rate 9/985; $0 . 9 \%$ . Of the nine (9) samples that initially produced invalid results, eight (8) were retested and five (5/8) produced valid results for a final invalid rate of 4/985 $( 0 . 2 \% )$

Of the 981 subjects with evaluable Alere i Strep A 2 test results, 582 $( 5 9 . 3 \% )$ ) were female and 399 $( 4 0 . 7 \% )$ were male.

Two throat swabs were collected from each subject. One swab was used for the reference bacterial culture according to standard procedures (inoculation of sheep blood agar followed by identification of $\beta$ -hemolytic colonies by latex agglutination); while the other swab was tested with Alere i Strep A 2. Swabs for analysis by the reference culture method were shipped to a central laboratory in dry transport tubes. All reference cultures were inoculated within 48 hours of specimen collection and culture plates were incubated for 48 hours before being discarded as negative. The overall performance of Alere i Strep A 2 in relation to the reference culture method is summarized in Table 7 and stratified by site in Table 8. The performance of Alere i Strep A 2 observed in the Clinical Study was considered acceptable.
