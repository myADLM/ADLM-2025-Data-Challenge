DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

# INTENDED USE:

LIAISON® BRAHMS PCT® II GEN assay uses chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) technology for the in vitro quantitative determination of Procalcitonin in human serum and lithium heparin plasma specimens. Used in conjunction with other laboratory findings and clinical assessments, LIAISON® BRAHMS PCT® II GEN is intended for use as follows:

- to aid in the risk assessment of critically ill patients on their first day of ICU admission for progression to severe sepsis and septic shock,

- to aid in assessing the cumulative 28-day risk of all-cause mortality for patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock in the ICU or when obtained in the emergency department or other medical wards prior to ICU admission, using a change in PCT level over time.

- to aid in decision making on antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected or confirmed lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) defined as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute bronchitis, and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) – in an inpatient setting or an emergency department,

- to aid in decision making on antibiotic discontinuation for patients with suspected or confirmed sepsis.

The LIAISON® Control BRAHMS PCT® (level 1 and level 2) are intended for use as assayed quality control samples to monitor the performance and reliability of the LIAISON® BRAHMS PCT® II GEN assay. The performance characteristics of LIAISON® BRAHMS PCT® II GEN controls have not been established with any other assay or instrument platform different from the LIAISON $\textcircled{8}$ Analyzer.

The LIAISON® BRAHMS PCT® II GEN calibration verifiers (four levels) are assayed quality control materials intended in the quantitative verification of calibration and reportable range of the LIAISON® BRAHMS ${ \mathsf { P C T } } ^ { \otimes }$ II GEN assay. The performance characteristics of LIAISON® BRAHMS $\mathsf { P C T } ^ { \otimes }$ II GEN calibration verifiers have not been established in connection with any other assay or instrument platforms different from the LIAISON® Analyzer.

# KIT DESCRIPTION:

The method for the quantitative determination of PCT is a sandwich chemiluminescence immunoassay. A specific monoclonal antibody is coated on the magnetic particles (solid phase); another monoclonal antibody (specific for a different epitope of the procalcitonin molecule) is linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-antibody conjugate).

During the first incubation, PCT present in calibrators, samples or controls binds to the antibody conjugate. Then the solid phase is added to the reaction. A sandwich is formed only in the presence of PCT molecules that bridge both antibodies. After the second incubation, the unbound material is removed with a wash cycle.

Subsequently, the starter reagents are added and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is thus induced. The light signal, and hence the amount of isoluminolantibody conjugate, is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is indicative of PCT concentration present in calibrators, samples or controls.

# PERFORMANCE DATA:

# Limit of Blank (LoB)\*

Following the method from CLSI EP17-A2, the limit of blank for the LIAISON® BRAHMS PCT® II GEN assay is 0.01 ng/mL.   
\*Limit of Blank, or the highest value likely to be observed with a sample containing no analyte, replaces the term “analytical sensitivity”.

# Limit of Detection (LoD)

Following the method from CLSI EP17-A2, the limit of detection for the LIAISON® BRAHMS PCT® II GEN assay is $0 . 0 2 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# Limit of Quantification (LoQ)

Following the method from CLSI EP17-A2, the limit of quantitation for the LIAISON® BRAHMS PCT® II GEN assay is 0.05 ng/mL ( %Bias $< 5 \%$ , $\% \mathrm { C V } < 1 5 \%$ and $\%$ Total error ${ < } 3 0 \%$ ).

A modeling analysis was conducted to evaluate the LOQ and each medical decision point. The Total Error (TE) $\%$ was calculated as $1 . 6 5 ^ { \star } ( \mathsf { C V } \% ) + ( \mathsf { B i a s } \% )$ . The results from each of three regression (Bias, CV and $T E \%$ ) are summarized in the table below and were based on fitting the Bias, CV and $T E \%$ from 320 data points for each medical decision point (0.10, 0.25, 0.50 and $2 \ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ generated from Precision studies and from 60 data points around $0 . 0 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ (ranging from 0.036 to $0 . 0 6 9 \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ generated from LOQ study.

# COMPARATIVESTUDIES/METHODCOMPARISON:

# Quantitative Analysis Study Design

A quantitative method comparison study was performed on 349 serum samples and 20 lithium heparin plasma samples for a total of 369 samples following CLSI EP09-A2. Of the 369 samples, one hundred four (104) samples were not included in the analysis because they read $< 0 . 0 5 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ which is below the reading range of either or both assays and one (1) sample read $> 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ on the LIAISON® BRAHMS PCT® II GEN assay and therefore was also removed from the analysis.

The PCT sample results ranged from 0.05 ng/mL to 131 ng/mL.

Weighted Deming analysis was applied to the results across the range of the LIAISON® BRAHMS ${ \mathsf { P C T } } ^ { \otimes }$ II GEN assay yielding agreement of $\ y \ = \ 1 . 0 7 \times \ + \ 0 . 0 3$ . The $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals for the slope were 1.03 to 1.11 and the $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals for the intercept 0.02 to $0 . 0 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

# REPRODUCIBILITY/PRECISION:

# Internal 20-day Precision

A twenty day reproducibility/precision study was performed internally at DiaSorin Inc. A coded panel comprised of 10 frozen serum samples spanning the assay range was prepared by DiaSorin S.p.A. One lot of $\mathsf { L } | \mathsf { A } | \mathsf { S } \mathsf { O N } ^ { \mathfrak { E } }$ Control BRAHMS ${ \mathsf { P C T } } ^ { \bullet }$ II GEN (2 levels) and one lot of $\mathsf { L i A l S O N } ^ { \textregistered }$ BRAHMS ${ \mathsf { P C T } } ^ { \otimes }$ II GEN verifiers (4 levels) were also tested in the study. The CLSI document EP05-A3 was consulted in the preparation of the testing protocol.

The precision panel samples, kit controls and verifiers were tested on two lots of LIAISON® BRAHMS PCT® II GEN in two replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 20 operating days on 1 LIAISON® Analyzer with multiple operators performing the testing The testing spanned at least two calibration cycles.

# Multi-Site Precision

A five day precision/reproducibility study was performed at two external laboratories and internally at DiaSorin Inc. to verify the precision of the LIAISON® BRAHMS PCT® II GEN assay.

A coded panel comprised of 10 frozen serum samples spanning the assay range was prepared by DiaSorin S.p.A. Two lots of LIAISON® Control BRAHMS PCT® II GEN (2 levels) and two lots of LIAISON® BRAHMS PCT® II GEN verifiers (4 levels) were also tested in the study. The CLSI document EP15-A3 was consulted in the preparation of the testing protocol.

The precision panel samples, kit controls, and verifiers were tested on one lot of LIAISON® BRAHMS ${ \mathsf { P C T } } ^ { \bullet }$ II GEN in three replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 5 operating days on 3 LIAISON® Analyzers with multiple operators performing the testing

# Results

The 5 day study results are summarized in table 8 for the 3 sites combined. The 3 sites combined data includes sample mean, SD and $\%$ CV for With-in run, Between day, Site to Site, and Total.

# SAMPLE EQUIVALENCY AND STABILITY STUDIES:

Equivalence testing was performed with 40 matched patient samples consisting of serum and lithium heparin collection tubes. Samples spanned the full assay measuring range. Spiked or diluted samples were used in order to span the assay range.

Paired samples were tested in triplicate in the same run using 1 reagent lot and 1 analyzer in order to exclude the effects of other variables on the results.

The (mean) result of each sample type under examination (y) is reported versus the mean result obtained with the reference sample type $( \mathsf { x } )$ .

Results of the serum and lithium heparin plasma samples were compared by Passing and Bablok and Weighted Deming regression. Human serum and Lithium Heparin Plasma are acceptable sample types for use in the LIAISON® BRAHMS ${ \mathsf { P C T } } ^ { \otimes }$ II GEN assay. A summary of the results are in Table 10 below.
