# I. Device Description:

The BreathID Hp System is a non-invasive breath test system for detecting the presence of Helicobacter pylori $( H . p y l o r i )$ . The system consists of the BreathID Hp device which is an electro-optical medical device with embedded software that measures and computes the changes in ratio between $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ and $^ { 1 2 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ concentrations in the patient’s exhalation, and the IDkit Hp One test kit.

The IDkit Hp One kit consists of:

One IDcircuit nasal cannula   
$\bullet$ One $7 5 \mathrm { m g } ^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C } .$ -urea tablet   
$\bullet$ One $4 . 3 \mathrm { g }$ package of powdered Citrica (citric acid)   
$\bullet$ One drinking straw Package Insert (Instructions for Use)

The BreathID Hp System continually measures and computes the ratio between $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ and $^ { 1 2 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ in the patient’s exhaled breath collected using a nasal cannula before and after the ingestion of ${ } ^ { \mathrm { i } 3 } \mathrm { C }$ -urea. The change in the $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 } / ^ { 1 2 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ ratio before and after ingestion of $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C } .$ - urea is used to compute the Delta over Baseline (DOB).

The $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C }$ measurement method for the BreathID Hp system is based on Molecular Correlation Spectroscopy (MCS) technology. MCS technology is based on the concept of optical absorption of specific radiation emitted from $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ discharge lamps.

# L. Test Principle:

The Exalenz BreathID Hp System is a non-invasive diagnostic test that analyzes a breath sample before and after ingestion of $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C } \mathrm { - }$ urea; it is used to identify those patients with $H .$ pylori infection. The Exalenz BreathID Hp System breath test is performed as follows: a 75 $\mathrm { { \dot { m } g ^ { 1 3 } C } }$ -urea tablet and $4 . 3 \ \mathrm { g }$ Citrica Powder are dissolved in water, and the resulting solution is ingested by the patient. The Citrica creates an acidic environment in the stomach and delays the transfer of the ingested solution to the duodenum. These two characteristics facilitate the decomposition of the urea by $H .$ pylori, if present. In the presence of gastric $H .$ . pylori urease, $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C }$ -urea is decomposed to $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ and $\mathrm { N H } _ { 3 }$ according to the following equation:

$$
\begin{array} { r l r } & { \boldsymbol { H } . p y l o r i \mathrm { u r e a s e } } \\ { 2 ^ { 1 3 } \boldsymbol { C } \mathrm { - u r e a } + 2 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \boldsymbol { \mathrm { O } } } & {  \qquad } & { 2 ^ { 1 3 } \boldsymbol { \mathrm { C O } } _ { 2 } + 2 \mathrm { N H } _ { 3 } } \end{array}
$$

In $H .$ pylori infected patients, $H .$ pylori urease cleaves the urea immediately after the $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C } .$ - urea solution is ingested. The resulting $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ is rapidly absorbed into the blood and then exhaled in the breath. The BreathID Hp System measures and computes the ratio between $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ and $^ { 1 2 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ in the patient’s exhaled breath before and after the ingestion of $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C }$ - urea. The change in the $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 } / ^ { 1 2 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ ratio before and after ingestion of $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C }$ -urea is used to compute the Delta over Baseline (DOB). In $H .$ pylori-negative patients, $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C }$ -urea is not converted to $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ in the stomach because there are no human enzymes that metabolize urea in the stomach.

The test begins with the collection of a baseline breath sample prior to ingestion of the $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C } .$ - urea test solution. The patient breathes normally while the BreathID Hp System collects samples through the IDcircuit nasal cannula. The IDcircuit extracts moisture and patient secretions from the breath samples to provide accurate $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ readings, and the device measures the $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 } / ^ { 1 2 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ ratio of the baseline measurement. The patient then ingests the $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C }$ -urea test drink. While the patient continues to breathe normally, the BreathID Hp System continually and non-invasively samples the patient’s breath via the cannula and measures the changes in the $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 } / ^ { 1 \bar { 2 } } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ ratio versus the baseline sample. These changes are displayed as a graph on the display screen while the test continues. The graph shows multiple points that allow the physician to identify the change in the DOB of the $^ { 1 3 } { \mathrm { C O } } _ { 2 } /$ $^ { 1 2 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 } ^ { * }$ ratio in response to the administered $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C }$ -urea. Once the BreathID Hp System has collected enough data to determine whether or not the graph passes the assay cut-off threshold unambiguously, it automatically ends the test and prints out the results.

b. Clinical specificity:

See K011668 for clinical specificity determined in an adult population.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

The clinical sensitivity and specificity of the BreathID Hp System for pre- and posttherapy $H .$ . pylori diagnosis was previously established in a clinical study with adult patients in comparison to esophagogastroduodenoscopy biopsy testing (K011668). No major changes to instrumentation, software, assay cut-off, drug formulation, or drug dosing were made for use in the pediatric population. Therefore, the BreathID Hp System test was evaluated in a limited number of pediatric subject with the primary goal of evaluating safety in this population. Supported by existing clinical performance in the adult population, device performance was assessed in a limited clinical study in a pediatric population as described below.

# Pediatric population study:

A multi-center, non-randomized, open label study was conducted with the primary goal of evaluating the safety of the standard dose of the $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C }$ -urea and citric acid solution in a pediatric population, and a secondary goal of evaluating performance of the BreathID Hp System compared to stool antigen testing in this population using IDkit Hp One kit breath collection and the same 5 DOB diagnostic cutoff. The study tested the $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C }$ -urea drug using the BreathID Hp System in symptomatic children ages 3-17 who were suspected of $H .$ pylori infection and who were scheduled to undergo both a breath test and an FDA cleared $H .$ pylori stool antigen test. The study was not powered to assess effectiveness in pediatric subjects, and the standard reference method (i.e., composite results based on samples from endoscopy) was not used as the comparator.

The study was conducted at six geographically diverse clinical sites of differing sizes and experience levels in the US and Israel. Local site personnel were trained on

administering the breath test. FDA cleared $H .$ . pylori stool antigen testing was analyzed at a central laboratory. All adverse events associated with the breath test were recorded.

A total of 54 subjects were screened for study enrollment, and one subject was excluded prior to participating in any study related procedure. Fifty-three subjects were enrolled and were followed for the safety assessment. Forty-one of the enrolled subjects completed the full study protocol requirements and provided evaluable results for both the BreathID Hp System and the stool antigen test. Of the total enrolled subjects, $5 7 \%$ (30/53) were female, $43 \%$ (23/53) were male, and $7 7 \%$ (41/53) were less than 12 years old.

# Results

Among the 53 pediatric subjects followed for the safety assessment, one adverse event of vomiting was experienced by one subject $( 1 . 8 9 \% )$ and resolved on the same day. No reportable major safety concerns were observed due to adverse events during the study.

For the 41 subjects with evaluable test results, the positive percent agreement (PPA) between the BreathID Hp System and the stool antigen test was $9 3 . 3 \%$ (14/15) $[ 9 5 \%$ CI: 70.19, 98.82], and the negative percent agreement (NPA) was $100 \%$ (26/26) $[ 9 5 \%$ CI: 87.1, 100]. See Table 1.
