# I. Device Description:

The blood sample to be tested is inoculated into one or more vials which are inserted into the BACTEC fluorescent series instrument for incubation and periodic reading. Each vial contains a chemical sensor which can detect increases in $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ produced by the growth of microorganisms. The sensor is monitored by the instrument every ten minutes for an increase in its fluorescence, which is proportional to the amount of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ present. A positive reading indicates the presumptive presence of viable microorganisms in the vial. Detection is limited to microorganisms that will grow in a particular type of culture medium.

# L. Test Principle:

The BD BACTEC Peds Plus $/ \mathrm { F }$ medium is an enriched soybean- casein digest broth, with each vial containing $4 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of broth. Sodium polyanetholesulfonate (SPS) is added to the medium as an anticoagulant that inhibits bacteriocidal activities in the blood. The concentration of SPS has been adjusted to accommodate the low blood volumes of 0.5- 5.0 mL per vial.

Each BD BACTEC Peds Plus/F culture vial contains a chemical sensor in a silicon rubber base that can detect increases in $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ produced by the growth of microorganisms. Low volume $( 0 . 5 - 5 \mathrm { m L } )$ of blood is inoculated into the BD BACTEC Peds Plus/F blood culture vial, which is inserted into the BD BACTEC Fluorescent Series instrument for incubation, agitation and periodic measurement. When microorganisms are present in the blood sample, they metabolize nutrients in the culture medium, releasing $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ into the medium. A dye in the sensor reacts with the $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ , modulating the amount of light that is absorbed by the fluorescent material in the sensor. The instrument’s photo detectors monitor the sensor every 10 minutes and measure the level of fluorescence, which is proportional to the amount of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ present in the vial. Positivity of a vial is determined by algorithms resident in the instrument rack’s microprocessor. The algorithms use the rate of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ production as well as the absolute increase in $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ to interpret the data.

Culture vials flagged as presumptively positive are removed from the instrument for subculture and Gram stain in order to identify the microorganisms for further evaluation and proposed patient treatment. Culture vials that are not flagged as positive remain in the instrument until the test protocol has been completed and negative vials are discarded at the end of protocol (120 hours).

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

# Instrument Time to Detection (TTD) study

The TTD (in hours) was recorded as part of the combined Percent Recovery and the Microbial Detection Limit (MDL) studies. MDL studies were conducted using the BD BACTEC FX and 9240 instruments at challenging inoculum levels 0- 1 and 1- 10 CFU per vial. The Percent Recovery study represented by the standard inoculum of 10 to 100 CFU per vial across four instruments (9050, 9240, FX, and FX40). Studies were conucted with $3 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ of blood over three media lots.

When stratified by organisms, it was noted that there were only four organisms that favored the compartor glass vial: Candida glabrata, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Candida albicans, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.

The TTD study demonstrated that the modified plastic device performed equivalently compared to the comparator glass device when stratified by target inoculum level, organisms or lot numbers. It was observed that the median TTD for the modified plastic vial and the predicate glass was 17.07 and 17.52 hours respectively. The median difference was -0.50 hours $( 9 5 \% \mathrm { C I } . 0 . 5 0 , - 0 . 3 3 )$ , favoring the plastic vial by approximately 30 minutes as noted in Tables 4.1 and 4.2 above.

# Percent Recovery (Detection) Study

The percent recovery (detection) was evaluated in a study of 492 paired sets (41 strains x 3 lots x 4 instruments $= 4 9 2$ ) at the standard inoculum level of 10 to 100 CFU/vial on four instruments across three lots with $3 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ of blood using a diverse set of 41 strains that are commonly isolated from blood. The strains tested is listed in Table 4.2 above.

At standard inoculum level of $1 0 { - } 1 0 0 \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ , the detection rate was $100 \%$ for both predicate glass and modified plastic devices. Difference in percent recovery was $0 \%$ . $9 5 \%$ CI is calculated using a score method for correlated proportion, shown in Table 5.1 for overall performance and in Table 5.2 stratified by lots.

The study demonstrated that the modified plastic device performed equivalently when compared to the comparator glass device. The detection rate was $100 \%$ for organisms listed in Table 4.2 at standard inoculum level of 10-100 CFU/vial with $3 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ of blood for both the comparator glass and the plastic vials.

# Haemophilus spp. Detection Re-calculation

There were four Haemophilus spp. tested in the percent recovery (detection) study with $3 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ of blood at the inoculum level of 10-100 CFU/vial. The detection rate was $100 \%$ (Table 5.1 above) due to the increased blood volume of $3 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ in this study.

The Haemophilus spp. detection rate was evaluated originally (K151866) for three target inoculum levels (0-1, 1-10, and 10-100) at $0 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ blood with the detection rate range of $8 \% - 4 0 \%$ . When stratified, the dataset of standard inoculum level 10- 100 CFU/vial with 0.5 and $5 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ blood was re-calculated and presented separately in the current submission.

There were a total of 96 paired sets (4 strains $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ blood vol. x 3 lots $\mathtt { x 4 }$ instruments $= 9 6$ in this re-calculation. The detection rate was $69 \%$ (33/48) and $100 \%$ (48/48) for $0 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ blood and $5 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ blood respectively. The detection rate is updated and presented separately according to blood volume at inoculum level of 10- 100 CFU/vial:

The Haemophilus species detection rates were $69 \%$ with 0.5 mL blood, and $100 \%$ with 5.0 mL

# False Negative Rates (Instrument-negative, subculture-positive)

A false negative was defined as a vial that was instrument-negative at the end of protocol (120 hours) yet contains viable organisms by subcultured onto appropriate culture media. The data for this study was generated from the Instrument Time to Detection, Percent Recovery, and Microbial Detection Limit studies.

A total of 110 instrument negative vials were sub-cultured at the end of protocol; 53 glass and 57 plastic vials. All subcultures were negative. There were no false negatives observed in either the glass or plastic device.

# False Positive Rate ((Instrument-positive, subculture-negative)

A false positive was defined as instrument positive but subculture negative. False positivity of the BACTEC Peds Plus/F plastic vial was assessed with 0.5, 3, and $5 \mathrm { m L }$ fresh human blood in the previous submission (K151866). No instrument false positive signals were detected in the evaluation.

The plastic device performed equivalently when compared to the glass device in the false positive study.

# BD BACTEC Instrument Compatibility

The BACTEC instrument compatibility study was evaluated from the MDL and Percent Recovery studies ( $1 8 0 + 4 9 2 = 6 7 2$ paired sets) across four fluorescent series instruments: BD BACTEC FX, FX40, 9240, and 9050. The study included target inoculum levels of 0-1, 1-10, and $1 0 { - } 1 0 0 \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ with $3 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ of blood. All four instruments were tested for standard inoculum level of 10-100 CFU/vial; FX and 9240 were tested for inoculum levels of 0-1, 1-10 CFU/mL. Of the 672 paired sets, 596 sets recovered organisms in both the comparator glass and plastic vials. The BACTEC instrument compatibility study is shown in Tables 6.1 and 6.2.

The Antimicrobail Neutralization Capability is to support the removal of the current limitation listed in the BACTEC Peds Plus/F Culture Vials (plastic) package insert, “Based on the neutralization study with Candida albicans and fluconazole, the media showed some degree of neutralization; however the results were inconclusive. The adequacy of antifungal neutralization by resins in the BD BACTEC Peds Plus/F vial (plastic) in unknown.”

In the antimicrobial neutralization study, fluconazole was evaluated at 1.0 and 2.0 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ with two susceptible strains of Candida albicans (expected fluconazole MIC: $0 . 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ at target inoculum of 10- 100 CFU/vial with $3 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ of blood in the Peds Plus/F Culture Vials Soybean-Casein Digest Broth with Resins. Each paired set was tested in triplicates for each strain at each fluconazole concentration:

2 strains $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ test concentration x 3 (triplicates) $= 1 2$ paired-sets

One set of non-resin vials (BACTEC Standard/10 Aerobic/F) with and without fluconazole were tested as controls for each strain at each fluconazole concentration. The non-resin vial with fluconazole served as negative (no growth) and the non-resin vial without fluconazole served as positive (growth) controls. The results are shown in Table 7.

The study demonstrated that resins in the Peds Plus/F media adequately neutralize fluconazole when testing Candida albicans at 10- 100 CFU/vial with $3 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ of blood. It upports the removal of the limitation. The following information specific for the antifungal agent/yeast combination is included in the Antimicrobial Activity section under limitation of the product labeling:

“Studies have demonstrated that the resins present in this medium adequately neutralize the antifungal agent fluconazole with Candida albicans. However, other antifungal agents/yeast combination have not been tested/evaluated.”

# b. Matrix comparison:

In seeded analytical studies, the performance of BD BACTEC Peds Plus/F culture medium in plastic vial was compared to that in glass vial, with $3 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ of blood, 32 common blood bloodstream bacteria and three yeast species across four fluorescent series instruments (BACTEC FX, FX40, BACTEC 9240, and BACTEC 9050).

3. Clinical studies:

Not applicable; seeded analytical studies to compare the plastic blood culture vials to the glass blood culture vials (comparator).

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off:

# Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Seeded analytical studies demonstrated equivalent performance of the BD BACTEC Peds Plus/F (plastic) blood culture medium when compared to the BD BACTEC Peds Plus/F (glass) blood culture medium.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
