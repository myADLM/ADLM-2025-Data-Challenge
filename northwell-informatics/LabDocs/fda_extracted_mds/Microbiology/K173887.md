# 1. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

cobas® CT/NG is a new qualitative test performed on the cobas® 6800 System and cobas® 8800 System. cobas® CT/NG enables the detection of CT/NG DNA in endocervical, vaginal, urine and cervical specimens of infected female patients and urine specimens in infected male patients. Target-specific primers and two probes are used to detect but not discriminate between the CT cryptic plasmid and the ompA gene. Additionally, target-specific primers and two probes are used to detect but not discriminate between two conserved sequences in the NG DR-9 region. The DNA Internal Control, used to monitor the entire sample preparation and PCR amplification process, is introduced into each specimen during sample processing. In addition, the test utilizes a low titer positive and a negative control.

# 1.1. Principles of the procedure

cobas® CT/NG is based on fully automated sample preparation (nucleic acid extraction and purification) followed by PCR amplification and detection. The cobas® 6800/8800 Systems consist of the sample supply module, the transfer module, the processing module, and the analytic module. Automated data management is performed by the cobas® 6800/8800 software which assigns test results for all tests as positive, negative or invalid. Results can be reviewed directly on the system screen, exported, or printed as a report.

Nucleic acid from patient samples, external controls and added internal control DNA (DNA-IC) molecules is simultaneously extracted. In summary, bacterial nucleic acid is released by addition of proteinase and lysis reagent to the sample. The released nucleic acid binds to the silica surface of the added magnetic glass particles. Unbound substances and impurities, such as denatured protein, cellular debris and potential PCR inhibitors are removed with subsequent wash steps and purified nucleic acid is eluted from the magnetic glass particles with elution buffer at elevated temperature.

Selective amplification of target nucleic acid from the sample is achieved by the use of targetspecific forward and reverse primers which are selected from highly conserved plasmid and genomic regions of CT and NG. A region on the CT cryptic plasmid and the ompA gene (dual target) and two conserved sequences of the NG DR-9 region are amplified by cobas® CT/NG.

Selective amplification of DNA-IC is achieved by the use of sequence-specific forward and reverse primers which are selected to have no homology with either the CT or NG target regions. A thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme is used for PCR amplification. The target and DNA-IC sequences are amplified simultaneously utilizing a universal PCR amplification profile with predefined temperature steps and number of cycles. The master mix includes deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP), instead of deoxythimidine triphosphate (dTTP), which is incorporated into the newly synthesized DNA (amplicon). Any contaminating amplicon from previous PCR runs are eliminated by the AmpErase enzyme, which is included in the PCR master mix, during the first thermal cycling step. However, newly formed amplicons are not eliminated since the AmpErase enzyme is inactivated once exposed to temperatures above $5 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

The cobas® CT/NG master mix contains two detection probes specific for the CT target sequences, two detection probes specific for the NG target sequences and one for the DNA-IC. The probes are labeled with target specific fluorescent reporter dyes allowing simultaneous detection of CT targets, NG targets and DNA-IC in three different target channels. When not bound to the target sequence, the fluorescent signal of the intact probes is suppressed by a quencher dye. During the PCR amplification step, hybridization of the probes to the specific single-stranded DNA template results in cleavage of the probe by the $5 "$ to $3 "$ exonuclease activity of the DNA polymerase resulting in separation of the reporter and quencher dyes and the generation of a fluorescent signal. With each PCR cycle, increasing amounts of cleaved probes are generated and the cumulative signal of the reporter dye increases concomitantly. Real-time detection and discrimination of PCR products is accomplished by measuring the fluorescence of the released reporter dyes for the CT and NG targets and DNA-IC, respectively.

# 4.3. Precision

In-house precision was examined using a panel composed of CT and NG cultures diluted into a pool of negative endocervical swab specimen matrix collected in cobas® PCR Media, a pool of negative urine matrix plus cobas® PCR Media and a pool of negative cervical specimen matrix collected in PreservCyt® Solution. Endocervical swabs were intended to represent all swab samples collected in cobas® PCR Media (endocervical and vaginal). Four levels were tested using CT serovar D and NG strain 2948 (ATCC 19424) as the target organisms.

The precision panel was designed to include members with high negative, low and moderate concentrations of CT and NG for each panel matrix, corresponding to ${ \sim } 0 . 3 \mathrm { x } , { \sim } 1 \mathrm { x }$ and ${ \sim } 3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD. Testing was performed with three lots of cobas $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CT/NG reagents and two instruments for a total of 24 runs. A description of the precision panels and the study performance hit rate is shown in Table 5. All negative panel members tested negative throughout the study. Analysis of standard deviation and percent coefficient of variation of the Ct values from valid tests performed on

positive panel members (see Table 6 and Table 7) yielded overall CV $( \% )$ ranges from $1 . 6 2 \%$ to $4 . 0 5 \%$ for CT and from $1 . 1 7 \%$ to $3 . 5 5 \%$ for NG. Testing occurred over 12 days, using 2 instruments, with 2 runs per day. Each run consisted of 3 replicates of each sample.

# 4.4. Analytical specificity/Cross-reactivity

A panel of 149 bacteria, fungi and viruses, including those commonly found in the male and female urogenital tract, 20 representatives of non-gonorrhoeae Neisseria strains and other phylogenetically unrelated organisms, were tested with cobas $\mathfrak { s c T } / \mathrm { N G }$ to assess analytical specificity. The organisms listed in Table 8 were spiked at concentrations of approximately $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ units\*/mL for bacteria and approximately $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ units $* / \mathrm { m L }$ for viruses into pools of negative vaginal swab specimens in cobas® PCR Media, urine stabilized in cobas® PCR Media and cervical specimens in PreservCyt® Solution. Testing was performed with each potential interfering organism alone as well as with each organism mixed with CT and NG cultures at ${ \sim } 3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD. Results indicated that none of these organisms interfered with the detection of CT and NG or produced false positive results in the CT/NG negative matrices. $\mathrm { N } { = } 3$ across the tested specimen types).

\*All bacteria were quantified as Colony Forming Units (CFU) except Chlamydophila pneumonia and Chlamydophila psittaci which were quantified as Elementary Bodies (EB). All viruses were quantified as units/mL as determined by TCID50 Endpoint Dilution Assay. Trichomonas vaginalis and HPV16 were quantified as cells/mL.

# 4.5. Interference

The effects of over-the-counter or prescription products that may be present in urogenital specimens (Table 9), were evaluated. Testing was done using pooled clinical specimens (vaginal swab, urine and PreservCyt® specimens) with spiking of potential interferents at levels expected from normal patient usage. Interferents were tested in CT/NG negative specimen pools as well as in specimen pools with CT/NG at ${ \sim } 3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD. CT serovars D and I and NG strains 2948 (ATCC 19424) and 891 were used in this study. Five replicates each of CT/NG negative and CT/NG positive samples were tested with each product in each specimen type, except for RepHreshTM Odor Eliminating Vaginal Gel and RepHreshTM Clean Balance Gel, which were tested with 2 replicates each to verify interference that had been observed with ReplensTM Long-Lasting Vaginal Moisturizer, a product with a similar formulation.

Of the over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription products tested, Metronidazole Vaginal Gel, ReplensTM Long-Lasting Vaginal Moisturizer, RepHreshTM Odor Eliminating Vaginal Gel and RepHreshTM Clean Balance produced false negative or invalid results in at least one replicate of the samples tested.

Endogenous substances that may be present in urogenital specimens were tested for interference. Testing was done using pooled clinical specimens (endocervical swab, urine and PreservCyt $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ specimens) with spiking of potential endogenous interferents. Interferents were tested in CT/NG negative specimen pools as well as in the presence of CT/NG at ${ \sim } 3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD. CT serovars D and I and NG strains 2948 (ATCC 19424) and 891 were used in this study. Five replicates each of CT/NG negative and CT/NG positive samples were tested with each substance in each specimen type.

Interference was noted with whole blood at $10 \%$ for urine and PreservCyt $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ specimens and with cervical mucus at $1 \%$ in endocervical specimens when at least one replicate of the samples tested produced false negative or invalid results . Levels of endogenous substances tolerated by the assay for all specimen types are shown in Table 10.

# 4.6. Competitive Inhibition

To assess competitive inhibition between CT and NG, samples of vaginal swab, urine and PreservCyt $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ specimens were tested with low and moderate concentrations of one target mixed with very high concentrations of the opposite target. Low and moderate concentrations were defined as ${ \sim } 1 \mathrm { x }$ LoD and ${ \sim } 3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD, respectively, and high concentrations $\scriptstyle ( \geq 1 0 ^ { 3 } \mathrm { I F U / m L }$ for CT and $\geq 1 0 ^ { 4 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ for NG) were defined as generating a signal greater than observed in $9 5 \%$ of target positive clinical specimens. Testing results indicated that when NG was present at a high concentration, CT was detected in all specimen types, at both low $\scriptstyle \left( \sim 1 \mathbf { x } \ L \mathbf { o } \mathbf { D } \right)$ and moderate $( \sim 3 \mathrm { x }$ LoD) levels. Results also indicated that when CT was present at a high concentration, NG was detected in all specimen types at moderate $\left( \sim 3 \mathbf { x } \ L \mathbf { o } \mathbf { D } \right)$ levels, however, NG was not consistently detected at low levels (Expanded testing indicated detection in $3 5 \%$ (7/20) of the samples at 0.4 CFU/ml and $60 \%$ (12/20) of the samples at $0 . 6 5 \mathrm { C F U / m l ) }$ .

# 4.7. Cross contamination/Carryover

Studies were performed to evaluate potential cross-contamination on the cobas $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 6800/8800 Systems using cobas $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CT/NG. Cross-contamination can cause false positive results. In this performance study the sample-to-sample cross-contamination rate of cobas $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CT/NG has been determined to be $0 . 5 \%$ (2/432), ( $9 5 \%$ CI: $0 . 1 \% - 1 . 7 \%$ ) when alternating very high positive and negative samples were tested over nine runs. Run-to-run cross-contamination has not been observed (0/282). Testing was done using samples prepared with cobas $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PCR Media and with PreservCyt $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Solution and with urine stabilized in cobas $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PCR Media. High positive samples $\left( \ge 1 0 3 \mathrm { \ I F U / m L } \right.$ for CT and $\ge 1 0 4 \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ for NG) in the study were prepared to generate a Ct value that was lower than that obtained with $9 5 \%$ or more of the specimens of infected patients in the intended use population. Cross contamination rates in clinical settings depend on the proportion of high positive samples and prevalence of the disease. Routine clinical crosscontamination rates are expected to be lower than what was observed in this study and need to be assessed in user’s settings.

# 5. CLINICAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

# 5.1. Clinical Performance

# 5.1.1. Study Design

The clinical utility and performance of cobas® CT/NG was established in a multi-site, prospective collection study by comparing the results to a Patient Infected Status (PIS) that used a combination of FDA-cleared NAATs for urogenital specimens. Female and male urogenital specimens were collected at 9 geographically diverse sites in the US with testing performed at 4 laboratory testing sites (3 external and 1 internal).

Prospectively enrolled female subjects provided the following urogenital specimens: first-void urine, 3 vaginal swabs, 1 endocervical swab in cobas® PCR Media, and 1 cervical sample in PreservCyt® Solution. If the female was in the clinician-collected vaginal swab arm of the study, 2 of the vaginal swabs were placed in the respective manufacturers’ collection device and 1 in cobas® PCR Media. If the female subject was in the self-collected vaginal swab self-collection arm of the study, then 1 vaginal swab was self-collected first and placed into cobas® PCR Media and then followed by the 2 clinician-collected vaginal swabs and placed in the 2 respective manufacturers’ collection devices.

Prospectively enrolled male subjects provided a urine specimen that was aliquoted into the respective manufacturers’ collection device and cobas® PCR Media.

Subjects were classified as symptomatic if they self-reported symptoms indicative of a CT or NG infection as listed below:

Dysuria (pain during urination)   
Coital pain, difficulty or bleeding   
Pelvic pain   
Abnormal vaginal discharge   
Pelvic, uterine or ovarian pain   
Urethral discharge   
Testicular pain   
Scrotal pain or swelling

Prospectively enrolled subjects were classified as asymptomatic if they did not report any of the above symptoms.

Specimens were tested for CT and NG using cobas® CT/NG and commercially available FDAcleared NAATs. All tests were run according to the respective manufacturers’ Instructions For Use.

The clinical performance of cobas® CT/NG was evaluated by comparing the results from collected specimen types to a pre-specified PIS (Patient Infected Status) algorithm as determined by the combined results from 2 commercially available NAATs for females and 3 commercially available NAATs for males. The PIS algorithms for Female and Male subjects are shown in Table 11 and Table 12, respectively.

For NG, archived prospectively collected female urine, cervical specimens in PreservCyt $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ , and endocervical swabs were obtained from the clinical study for cobas $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CT/NG v2 test on the cobas $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 4800 System. The PIS of these specimens were already determined from the clinical study for cobas $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CT/NG v2 test on the cobas $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 4800 System..

a One or more positives in each NAAT (NAAT1 and NAAT2) designates the PIS as Infected. Any other combination of results defines the PIS as Not Infected.

b In the scenario where one or more of the sample types are invalid, the remaining sample types with valid results from NAAT1 and NAAT2 must have concordant positive or concordant negative results to determine the PIS as Infected or Not Infected, respectively. For all other cases where one or more of the sample types are invalid, the PIS is indeterminate.

a If at least 2 out of the 3 test results are concordant positive or negative then the PIS can be considered as Infected or Not Infected, respectively. If one test result is invalid/missing and the other two test results are discordant then the PIS is indeterminate. If 2 or 3 test results are invalid/missing, then the PIS is indeterminate.

Sensitivity (SENS), specificity (SPEC), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of cobas® CT/NG were calculated separately for the detection of CT or NG using the PIS as the composite reference standard and evaluated by gender, sample type, and symptom status. In addition, the predictive values were calculated based on overall sensitivity and specificity (with all data combined for males and females) for a range of hypothetical prevalence values.

# 5.1.2. Results

A total of 5,197 subjects were prospectively enrolled, of which 5,105 were eligible for inclusion. Of the 5,105 eligible subjects contributing prospective specimens, 5,053 $( 9 9 . 0 \% )$ (3,860 females and 1,193 males) were evaluable and were included in the data analyses. A total of 52 subjects $( 1 . 0 \% )$ were classified as non-evaluable and excluded from all statistical analyses. There were a total of 371 archived prospectively collected female urogenital samples (urine, cervical specimens in PreservCyt, and endocervical swabs) tested in this clinical study from 295 female subjects. Among the 17,169 samples tested in this study, 19 samples exhibited invalid results on the first run (invalid rate of $0 . 1 1 \%$ $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I } \colon 0 . 0 7 \% \ ; 0 . 1 7 \% )$ ). Upon repeat testing, 3 samples exhibited valid results.

Table 13 and Table 14 summarize the results from symptomatic and asymptomatic, prospectively enrolled subjects designated as infected or non-infected with CT (females and males, respectively) according to the PIS algorithm. A total of 271 females and 118 males were infected with CT. Symptoms were reported in $4 5 . 8 \%$ (124/271) of infected and $3 6 . 7 \%$ (1318/3589) of non-infected females. Symptoms were reported in $5 3 . 4 \%$ (63/118) of infected and $2 2 . 5 \%$ (242/1074) of non-infected males.

Note: In the scenario where one or more of the sample types are invalid/not available (NA), for female subjects, the remaining sample types with valid results from NAAT1 and NAAT2 must have concordant positive or concordant negative results to determine the PIS as Infected or Not Infected, respectively. For all other cases where one or more of the sample types are invalid/not available (NA), the PIS is indeterminate.

Note: Female subjects with designated infection status (Infected or Non-Infected) and final valid cobas® CT/NG test results are considered evaluable and included in this summary table.

Note: cobas Invalid are the sum of instrument amplification/detection errors and samples excluded due to protocol deviations

Note: cobas Failed are hardware, software or operator errors causing no result reported

c Five NG PIS infected females had a NG negative urine specimen with NAAT1 and NAAT2 while they had a NG positive vaginal swab with NAAT1 and NAAT2

\* One subject was missing symptom status and is not included in this table.

Note: In the scenario where one or more of the sample types are invalid/not available, for female subjects, the remaining sample types with valid results from NAAT1 and NAAT2 must have concordant positive or concordant negative results to determine the PIS as Infected or Non-Infected, respectively. For all other cases where one or more of the sample types are invalid/ not available, the PIS is indeterminate.

Note: If at least 2 out of the 3 test results, for male subjects, are concordant positive or negative then the PIS can be considered as Infected or Non-Infected, respectively. If one test result is invalid/not available and the other two test results are discordant then the PIS is indeterminate. If 2 or 3 test results are invalid/not available, then the PIS is indeterminate.

Note: Subjects with designated patient infection status (Infected or Non-Infected) and final valid cobas® CT/NG test results are considered evaluable and included in this summary table. An evaluable subject may not have all available sample types or valid test results.

Note: Archived prospectively collected specimens were from COB-CTNG-282 study and included female PIS positive subjects that have available sample with adequate volume for testing.

# 5.2. Clinical Reproducibility

# 5.2.1. Study Design

A Reproducibility Study was performed across different sites, lots, operators/batches days, for cobas® CT/NG using three panels prepared from swabs and urine in cobas® PCR Media and cervical specimens in PreservCyt® Solution. PCR testing was performed at two external sites and one site that was in-house at Roche Molecular Systems. One panel consisted of the three sample matrices, with six concentrations per matrix, and three replicates per concentration for a total of 54 samples in one panel. A batch was comprised of one 54-sample panel and two controls (one positive control and one negative control). Two operators at each site tested one batch each per day. Two valid batches had to be completed within a 24-hour period. Each site received two of three reagent lots and performed 6 days of testing per reagent lot for a total of 12 days of testing.

# 5.2.2. Results

The Reproducibility Study was executed with a total of 3,888 tests performed on the 6 panel groups, consisting of 1,296 tests for each panel type (urine, swab, and PreservCyt®), with only two failed tests each from PreservCyt®. No false positive results for either CT or NG were observed in the three panel types for negative panel members; thus the negative percent agreement was $100 \%$ for each analyte. Results for the positive panel members were highly reproducible across different lots, sites/instruments, days and operators/batches.

# 5.2.2.1. Negative panel results

For each sample type, all of the 216 valid tests from the negative panel members resulted in “Negative Results”. Hence, for both CT and NG, the percent of correct results (analytical specificity) was estimated as $100 \%$ with a corresponding $9 5 \%$ exact confidence interval of $9 8 . 3 \%$ , $100 \%$ for cobas® PCR Media/urine, for cobas® PCR Media/swab and for PreservCyt®/cervical sample types.

# 5.2.2.2. Chlamydia trachomatis results

For each positive panel member, precision was evaluated using a random effects model by sample type with terms for lot, site, day, operator/batch within site, lot and day, and within-batch components on the corresponding analyte cycle threshold (Ct) values of cobas® CT/NG. Table 19 presents the total SD, and total percent CV $( \% )$ from these analyses for each panel type, respectively. The range of the total coefficient of variation, among positive panel members, was from $0 . 9 \%$ to $3 . 2 \%$ . The maximum total coefficient of variation was observed in the lowest concentration of positive panel members ( $0 . 3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD CT, $0 . 3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD NG) and most of that variability $9 8 . 6 \%$ for urine, $100 \%$ for swab and $8 1 . 7 \%$ for cervical) was explained by random error (within-batch).

# 5.2.2.3. Neisseria gonorrhoeae results

Analysis of variance components of the Ct values from valid NG test results were performed on positive panel members. Table 23 presents the total SD and total CV $( \% )$ from these analyses. The range of the total coefficient of variation, among positive panel members, was from $1 . 0 \%$ to $3 . 1 \%$ . The maximum total coefficient of variation was observed in the lowest concentration of positive panel members (0.3x LoD CT, 0.3x LoD NG) and most of that variability $9 8 . 7 \%$ for urine, $9 8 . 1 \%$ for swab and $8 5 . 3 \%$ for cervical) was explained by random error (within-batch).

For panel members with concentrations at or near the limit of detection (e.g., 1x LoD) of the test, the lower limit of the 2-sided $9 5 \%$ exact CI of the percentage of correct test results should be equal to or greater than $91 \%$ . For panel members with concentrations 3-times above the limit of detection (e.g., 3x LoD) of the test, the lower limit of the 2-sided $9 5 \%$ exact CI of the percentage of correct test results should be equal to or greater than $9 8 \%$ .

For panel members with concentrations at or near the limit of detection (e.g., 1x LoD) of the test, the lower limit of the 2-sided $9 5 \%$ exact CI of the percentage of correct test results was at least $9 7 . 4 \%$ for CT and $9 5 . 3 \%$ for NG.

For panel members with concentrations 3-times above the limit of detection (e.g., 3x LoD) of the test, the lower limit of the 2-sided $9 5 \%$ exact CI of the percentage of correct test results was $9 8 . 3 \%$ for both CT and NG.

# 6. CONCLUSIONS

A comparison of the intended use, technological characteristics, and the results of non-clinical analytical and clinical performance studies demonstrate that cobas® CT/NG for use on the cobas® 6800/8800 systems is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
