# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): N/A

# L. Test Principle:

The cobas CT/NG assay is based on fully automated sample preparation (nucleic acid extraction and purification) followed by PCR amplification and detection. The cobas 6800/8800 Systems consist of the sample supply module, the transfer module, the processing module, and the analytic module. Automated data management is performed by the cobas 6800/8800 software which assigns test results for all tests as positive, negative, or invalid. Results can be reviewed directly on the system screen, exported, or printed as a report.

Nucleic acid from patient samples and internal control DNA (DNA-IC), added into the specimens to monitor for inhibition of nucleic acid isolation and amplification, is simultaneously extracted. In summary, bacterial nucleic acid is released by addition of proteinase and lysis reagent to the sample. The released nucleic acid binds to the silica surface of added magnetic glass particles. Unbound substances and impurities, such as denatured protein, cellular debris and potential PCR inhibitors are removed with subsequent wash steps and purified nucleic acid is eluted from the magnetic glass particles with elution buffer at elevated temperature.

Selective amplification of target nucleic acid from the sample is achieved by the use of targetspecific forward and reverse primers selected from highly conserved plasmid and genomic regions of CT and NG. A region on the CT cryptic plasmid and the ompA gene (dual target) and two conserved sequences of the NG DR-9 region are amplified. Selective amplification of DNA-IC is achieved by the use of sequence-specific forward and reverse primers which have no homology with either the CT or NG target regions. A thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme is used for PCR amplification. The target and DNA-IC sequences are amplified simultaneously utilizing a universal PCR amplification profile with predefined temperature steps and number of cycles. The master mix includes deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) instead of deoxythimidine triphosphate (dTTP), which is incorporated into the newly synthesized DNA (amplicon). Any contaminating amplicons from previous PCR runs are eliminated by the AmpErase enzyme, which is included in the PCR master mix, during the first thermal cycling step. However, newly formed amplicons are not eliminated since the AmpErase enzyme is inactivated once exposed to temperatures above $5 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

The cobas CT/NG master mix contains two detection probes specific for the CT target sequences, two detection probes specific for the NG target sequences and one for the DNAIC. The probes are labeled with target specific fluorescent reporter dyes allowing simultaneous detection of CT targets, NG targets, and DNA-IC in three different channels. When not bound to the target sequence, the fluorescent signal of the intact probes is suppressed by a quencher dye. During the PCR amplification step, hybridization of the probes to the specific single-stranded DNA template results in cleavage of the probe by the $5 "$ to $3 "$ exonuclease activity of the DNA polymerase resulting in separation of the reporter and quencher dyes and the generation of a fluorescent signal. With each PCR cycle, increasing amounts of cleaved probes are generated and the cumulative signal of the reporter dye increases concomitantly. Real-time detection and discrimination of PCR products is

accomplished by measuring the fluorescence of the released reporter dyes for the CT and NG targets and DNA-IC, respectively.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision:

Precision of the cobas CT/NG assay was examined in-house using a panel composed of CT and NG cultures diluted into the following backgrounds: 1. negative endocervical swab specimen matrix collected in cobas PCR Media, 2. negative urine matrix mixed with cobas PCR Media, and 3. negative cervical specimen matrix collected in PreservCyt Solution. Endocervical swabs were intended to represent both swab specimen types (endocervical and vaginal) collected in cobas PCR Media. Four levels of each analyte were tested using CT serovar D and NG strain 2948 (ATCC 19424) as the target organisms.

The precision panel for each of the three matrices contained one negative panel member and panel members with high negative, low positive, and moderate positive concentrations of CT and NG, corresponding to ${ \underline { { < 0 . 3 \mathrm { X } } } }$ LoD, ${ \sim } 1 \mathrm { X }$ LoD, and ${ \sim } 3 \mathrm { X }$ LoD, for each panel matrix. Upon repeated measure, specimens with concentrations of 1X LoD are expected to yield positive results $2 9 5 \%$ of the time and specimens with concentrations of 3X LoD are expected to yield positive results $2 9 9 \%$ of the time. Testing was performed over 12 nonconsecutive days with three lots of cobas CT/NG reagents and two runs per day using two instruments for a total of 24 runs. A total of 72 replicates were tested for each panel member.

Study results demonstrated the expected percent agreement for all panel members. All negative panel members tested negative throughout the study. Analysis of standard deviation and percent coefficient of variation (CV) of the $\mathrm { C t }$ values from valid tests performed on positive panel members yielded overall CV $( \% )$ ranges from $1 . 5 9 \%$ to $4 . 0 5 \%$ for CT and from $1 . 1 7 \%$ to $3 . 5 5 \%$ for NG. Detailed results for this study are presented in the Tables 1-3 below.

# Reproducibility:

A Reproducibility Study was performed across different sites, lots, operators/batches, and days, for cobas CT/NG using three panels of pooled negative or contrived specimens prepared from swabs and urine in cobas PCR Media and cervical specimens in PreservCyt Solution. Testing was performed at one in-house and two external sites. One panel consisted of the three sample matrices, with six concentrations per matrix, and three replicates per concentration for a total of 54-samples in one panel. Concentrations utilized were as follows, with positive panel members prepared by spiking CT serovar D and/or NG 19424 into the CT/NG-negative background:

$\mathrm { C T } = { \mathrm { . } }$ Chlamydia trachomatis; LoD $=$ limit of detection; $\mathrm { N G } =$ Neisseria gonorrhoeae

A batch was comprised of one 54-sample panel and two controls (one positive control and one negative control). Two operators at each site tested one batch each per day with each lot. Two valid batches had to be completed within a 24-hour period. Each site received two of the three reagent lots and performed 6 days of testing per reagent lot for a total of

12 days of testing. For each combination of concentrations noted, a total of 216 replicates were tested in each specimen type (urine, swab, and PreservCyt) for a total of 3,888 tests performed, with only two failed tests each from PreservCyt.

No false positive results for either CT or NG were observed in any of the three matrices; thus the negative percent agreement was $100 \%$ for both analytes. For panel members with concentrations at or near the limit of detection (e.g., 1x LoD) of the test, the lower limit of the 2-sided $9 5 \%$ CI of the percentage of correct test results was at least $9 7 . 4 \%$ for CT and $9 5 . 3 \%$ for NG.

For panel members with concentrations 3-times above the limit of detection (e.g., 3x LoD) of the test, the lower limit of the 2-sided $9 5 \%$ CI of the percentage of correct test results was $9 8 . 3 \%$ for both CT and NG.

Notes: LoD $=$ Limit of Detection; $\mathrm { C T = }$ Chlamydia trachomatis; $\mathrm { N G } =$ Neisseria gonorrhoeae. \*assessed based on valid test results

For each positive panel member, precision was evaluated by sample type in terms of lot, site, day, operator/batch within site, lot and day, and within-batch components on the corresponding analyte cycle threshold $\mathrm { ( C t ) }$ values of cobas CT/NG.

# Chlamydia trachomatis results:

The range of the total coefficient of variation, among positive panel members, was from $0 . 9 \%$ to $3 . 2 \%$ . The maximum total coefficient of variation was observed in the high negative panel members $0 . 3 \mathrm { x }$ LoD CT, $0 . 3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD NG) and most of that variability $( 9 8 . 6 \%$ for urine, $100 \%$ for swab and $8 1 . 7 \%$ for cervical) was explained by random error.

# Neisseria gonorrhoeae results:

The range of the total coefficient of variation, among positive panel members, was from $1 . 0 \%$ to $3 . 1 \%$ . The maximum total coefficient of variation was observed in the lowest concentration of positive panel members (0.3x LoD CT, $0 . 3 \mathrm { x }$ LoD NG) and most of that variability $( 9 8 . 7 \%$ for urine, $9 8 . 1 \%$ for swab and $8 5 . 3 \%$ for cervical) was explained by random error (within-batch).

Detailed results from testing are presented in Tables 9-12.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:   
Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Controls:

External controls are provided in the cobas CT/NG Positive Control Kit and the cobas Buffer Negative Control Kit, and are required to be included in each run. Validation of results is performed automatically by the cobas 6800/8800 software based on negative and positive control performance. Invalid batches require repeat testing of the entire batch. The CT/NG Positive Control contains non-infectious DNA plasmids of both CT and NG sequences and is used as a run control to monitor target amplification and detection. The cobas Buffer Negative Control Kit contains buffer with no nucleic acid.

In addition, a DNA Internal Control is introduced into each specimen during sample processing and monitors specimens for substances that may interfere with nucleic acid isolation and PCR amplification. The DNA Internal Control contains a non-CT/NG related DNA construct containing primer and probe specific sequence regions.

# Specimen Stability:

Specimen stability during storage was evaluated for the following four specimen types:

Endocervical swabs collected in cobas PCR media   
Vaginal swabs collected in cobas PCR media   
Urine stabilized by cobas PCR media   
Cervical specimens collected in PreservCyt Solution (primary and secondary containers)

Samples were prepared for each specimen matrix by combining prescreened negative individual specimens to generate ten unique pools. Five pools of each specimen type were used as CT/NG negative samples and five pools were used to prepare CT/NG positive samples. Positive samples were prepared by spiking individual CT and NG positive specimens into the negative samples to approximately $3 \mathrm { ~ X ~ }$ LoD. Testing was performed on the day of sample preparation and at several time points during the storage time period. Study results demonstrated that positive samples remained positive for a minimum of 12 months when stored at both $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $3 2 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . Matrix-only samples yielded the expected negative results for the same storage conditions. PreservCyt samples transferred to secondary containers demonstrated stability for up to 31 days when stored at both $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $3 2 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

Analytical sensitivity (Limit of Detection or LoD) of the cobas CT/NG Test for use on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems was determined by analyzing a dilution series of quantified cultures of Chlamydia trachomatis (serovars D and I) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates 2948 (ATCC 19424) and 891. CT and NG cultures were diluted into a matrix of pooled negative specimens for each specimen type:

Endocervical swabs collected in cobas PCR media Vaginal swabs collected in cobas PCR media Urine stabilized by cobas PCR media Cervical specimens collected in PreservCyt Solution

CT serovars and NG strains were tested at five concentration levels across three reagent lots, with 21-30 replicates for each positive level per reagent lot. The claimed LoD as established by the $9 5 \%$ Hit Rate Analysis represents the lowest concentration level which was detected $\mathrm { i n } \geq 9 5 \%$ of tested replicates and for which all higher concentration levels also had $2 9 5 \%$ detection. The LoD for CT serovars D and I and NG strains 2948 and 891 for each matrix are as follows:

# Inclusivity:

Inclusivity and verification of the LoD were performed for 13 additional CT serovars, the Swedish new variant strain (nvCT) and an additional 43 independently isolated strains of NG using one lot of reagents. Testing was performed using CT and NG cultures diluted into negative background prepared for each specimen type by pooling pre-screened specimens negative for both CT and NG. Specimen types evaluated were: 1. vaginal swab specimens collected in cobas PCR media (intended to represent both endocervical and vaginal swab specimens), 2. urine mixed with cobas PCR media, and 3. cervical specimens collected in PreservCyt Solution. CT serovars and NG strains were spiked to concentrations that were near the highest LoD levels determined in the Limit of Detection study, and were tested concurrently when feasible. Twenty replicates were tested for each strain in each specimen type. Additional dilution levels and replicates were tested for those strains which did not demonstrate a $2 9 5 \%$ hit rate for the previously established LoDs. Results are shown in the Tables 14 and 15 below.

In summary, based upon study results, the cobas CT/NG assay for use on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems detects the known serovars of CT and 43 strains of NG.

# e. Analytical specificity and microbial interference:

A panel of 149 bacteria, fungi, and viruses, including those commonly found in the male and female urogenital tract, 20 representatives of non-gonorrhoeae Neisseria strains and other phylogenetically unrelated organisms, were tested with the cobas CT/NG assay to assess analytical specificity/cross-reactivity (see Table 17). Samples were spiked at concentrations of approximately $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ units/mL for bacteria and approximately $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ units $/ \mathrm { m L } ^ { 1 }$ for viruses into negative background prepared for each specimen type by pooling pre-screened specimens negative for both CT and NG. Specimen types evaluated were: 1. vaginal swab specimens collected in cobas PCR media (intended to represent both endocervical and vaginal swab specimens), 2. urine mixed with cobas PCR media, and 3. cervical specimens collected in PreservCyt Solution. Testing was performed with each potential interfering organism alone as well as with each organism mixed with CT and NG cultures at approximately 3x LoD. Results indicated that none of these organisms interfered with the detection of CT and NG or produced false positive results in the CT/NG negative matrices.

# f. Assay cut-off:

An assay cut-off of Ct value $= 5 0$ , where 50 is the last PCR profile cycle, was established for the cobas CT/NG for use on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems. Negative results occur when amplification does not occur or fails to result in adequate signal, and no Ct value is reported. Acceptability of the cut-off was verified through analysis of CT and NG cycle threshold (Ct) value distribution for all specimens from the US clinical study and selected analytical studies, as evidenced by a clear distinction between positive results and negative results/the end of the PCR profile. Analytical studies were included in this assessement to enrich the dataset with results from samples with a low target concentration. Stability and interference studies data were not included in this analysis, since those studies are designed to stress the system thereby potentially producing invalid results.

Assessed for these studies as described, the difference between the latest Ct value in positive specimens and assay cut-off was 5.5 cycles for CT and 3.5 cycles for NG. For specimens from the clinical study only, broken out to assess performance in a typical patient population, the difference between the latest Ct value in positive specimens and assay cut-off was 7.8 cycles for CT and 3.5 cycles for NG (shown below). The following graphs illustrate the distribution of Ct values from the clinical study.

# g. Contamination:

Sample-to-sample and run-to-run cross-contamination studies were performed to evaluate potential cross contamination on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems using the cobas CT/NG assay. Contrived sample backgrounds consisting of clean media with HCT-15 cells were used to represent swab samples collected in cobas PCR media (endocervical and vaginal swabs) and cervical specimens collected in PreservCyt Solution. Pooled CT/NG negative urine specimens were included in the study. Positive samples were prepared by co-spiking a portion of the negative samples with CT and NG cultures to a concentration that generated a Ct value ${ \sim } 2 0$ cycles representing the Ct value lower than that observed in $9 5 \%$ of positive results in the intended use population. Three runs consisting of a checkerboard pattern of positive CT and NG samples alternating with negative samples were performed, followed by a full run of CT/NG negative samples to assess run-to-run contamination. Two CT/NG negative urine samples out of 144 total negative samples tested positive for both CT and NG within one of the checkerboard runs $( 2 / 1 4 4 , 1 . 4 \% )$ . The total sample-tosample cross-contamination rate of cobas CT/NG for all sample types for the three checkerboard runs was determined to be $0 . 5 \%$ (2/432). Run-to-run cross-contamination was not observed (0/282).

# h. Competitive Inhibition Studies:

To assess competitive inhibition between CT and NG, contrived specimens were tested with low and moderate concentrations of one target mixed with very high concentrations of the opposite target. Low and moderate concentrations were defined as ${ \sim } 1 \mathrm { x } \ \mathrm { L o D }$ and ${ \sim } 3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD, respectively, and high concentrations were defined as generating a Ct value that was lower than the value observed in $9 5 \%$ of CT and NG positive specimens. Positive test samples were prepared by spiking CT serovar D and NG strain 2948 cultures into negative background matrix prepared for each specimen type by pooling pre-screened specimens negative for both CT and NG. Specimen types evaluated were: 1. vaginal swab collected in cobas PCR media (intended to represent both endocervical and vaginal swab samples), 2. urine mixed with cobas PCR media, and 3. cervical specimens collected in PreservCyt Solution. Five replicates of each panel member were tested. Additional samples were prepared for the vaginal swab matrix containing CT at a high concentration and NG at 0.4 CFU/ml, 0.65 CFU/ml, and $1 . 9 5 \mathrm { C F U / m l }$ . These concentrations of NG represent LoD as determined by the observed $9 5 \%$ hit rate, the upper limit for the Probit estimate of the LoD, and 3X of the upper limit for the Probit estimate of the LoD, respectively.

Results indicate that CT was detected at or above the LoD in all specimen types even when NG was present at a high concentration. When CT was present at high concentrations, NG was detected in $100 \%$ of specimens (all types) at moderate levels $( { \sim } 3 \mathrm { X } \mathrm { L o D } )$ , and for cervical and urine specimens NG was also detected in $100 \%$ of specimens at low levels $[ \mathord { \sim } 1 \mathrm { X }$ LoD). For vaginal swab specimens, when CT was present at high concentrations, NG was detected in $3 5 \%$ (7 of 20) of replicates at $0 . 4 \ : \mathrm { C F U / m l }$ , $60 \%$ (12 of 20) of replicates at $0 . 6 5 \mathrm { C F U / m l }$ , and $100 \%$ (20 of 20) of replicates at $1 . 9 5 \mathrm { C F U / m l }$ .

A limitation is included in the package insert describing the identified competitive inhibition.

# i. Interferences:

# Testing of Exogenous Substances:

Performance of the cobas CT/NG assay for use on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems was evaluated in the presence of potentially interfering exogenous substances including over-the counter products and prescription drugs that may be present in urogenital specimens. Specimen types evaluated were: 1. vaginal swabs collected in cobas PCR media (intended to represent both endocervical and vaginal swab samples), 2. urine mixed with cobas PCR media, and 3. cervical specimens collected in PreservCyt Solution. Testing was performed using negative background matrix prepared for each specimen type by pooling pre-screened specimens negative for both CT and NG. The negative matrices were spiked with potential interferents at levels expected from normal patient usage. Interferents were tested in CT/NG negative specimen pools as well as in specimen pools co-spiked with serovars D or I of Chlamydia trachomatis and strains 2948 or 891 of Neisseria gonorrhoeae at ${ \sim } 3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD.

Five replicates of each sample for each specimen type were tested with the potential interfents, except for RepHresh Odor Eliminating Vaginal Gel And RepHresh Clean Balance Gel for which two replicates each were tested to verify interference observed with Replens, a product with similar formulation. In addition, one sample for each specimen type was tested without the addition of potentially interfering products.

Results of the study demonstrate that 14 of the 18 exogenous substances tested did not interfere with the performance of the assay for detection of CT and NG. Metronidazole Vaginal Gel, RepHresh Odor Eliminating Vaginal Gel, RepHresh Clean Balance Gel and Replens Vaginal Moisturizer showed interference leading to false negative and invalid results in urogenital specimens at levels that may be present in patient specimens.

# Testing of Endogenous Substances:

Performance of cobas CT/NG was evaluated in the presence of potentially-interfering endogenous substances including whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and mucus. Sample types included in the study were: 1. endocervical swabs collected in cobas PR media (intended to represent both endocervical and vaginal swab samples), 2. urine mixed with cobas PCR media, and 3. cervical specimens collected in PreservCyt Solution. Interferents were tested in CT/NG negative specimen pools as well as in specimen pools spiked with serovars D or I of Chlamydia trachomatis and strains 2948 or 891 of Neisseria gonorrhoeae at $\sim 3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD. The endogenous substances were introduced to the negative and positive samples at levels that may be present in typical clinical specimens. Five replicates of each sample for each specimen type were tested with each potentially interfering substance, and one sample for each specimen type was tested without the addition of the potentially interfering substance.

Mucus at a concentration of approximately $1 \%$ (w/v) caused false negative results for NG in endocervical samples. Whole blood caused interference at $10 \%$ (v/v) in CT/NG negative and positive urine samples and in CT/NG positive PreservCyt samples.

Limitations are included in the package insert describing endogenous substances that demonstrated interference with cobas CT/NG. A summary of endogenous substances concentrations that do not interfere with cobas CT/NG assay performance is shown in Table 19.

3. Clinical studies:

The clinical performance of cobas CT/NG was established in a multi-site, prospective collection study by comparing the results to a Patient Infected Status (PIS) that used a combination of FDA-cleared NAATs for urogenital specimens in each patient. Female and male urogenital specimens were collected at nine geographically diverse sites in the US, which included family planning and obstetrics/gynecology (OB/GYN) clinics and sexually transmitted disease clinics. The testing was performed at four laboratory testing sites (three external and one internal).

Prospectively enrolled female subjects provided the following urogenital specimens: firstvoid urine, three vaginal swabs, one endocervical swab in cobas PCR Media, and one cervical sample in PreservCyt Solution. If the female was in the clinician-collected vaginal swab arm of the study, two of the vaginal swabs were placed in the respective manufacturers’ collection device and one in cobas PCR Media. If the female subject was in the self-collected vaginal swab arm of the study, then one vaginal swab was selfcollected first and placed into cobas PCR Media and then followed by the two cliniciancollected vaginal swabs placed in the two respective manufacturers’ collection devices.

Prospectively enrolled male subjects provided a urine specimen that was aliquoted into the respective manufacturers’ collection device and cobas PCR Media.

Subjects were classified as symptomatic if they self-reported symptoms indicative of a CT or NG infection, as listed below. Subjects were classified as asymptomatic if they did not report any of these symptoms.

Dysuria (pain during urination)   
· Coital pain, difficulty or bleeding   
· Pelvic pain Abnormal vaginal discharge Pelvic, uterine or ovarian pain Urethral discharge   
· Testicular pain Scrotal pain or swelling

Specimens were tested for CT and NG using cobas CT/NG and FDA-cleared commercially available NAATs. All tests were run according to the respective manufacturers’ Instructions For Use.

The clinical performance of cobas CT/NG was evaluated by comparing the results from collected specimen types to a pre-specified PIS (Patient Infected Status) algorithm as determined by the combined results from two FDA-cleared NAATs for females and three FDA-cleared NAATs for males. The PIS algorithms for Female and Male subjects are shown in the Tables 20 and 21.

Archived prospectively collected female urine, cervical specimens in PreservCyt, and endocervical swabs were obtained for the clinical study for cobas CT/NG v2 test on the cobas 4800 System. The PIS of these specimens were already determined during the clinical study for cobas CT/NG v2 test on the cobas 4800 System. NG PIS infected female subjects who had specimens with adequate volume for NG testing with cobas CT/NG assay were included in the current study. In addition, a random subset of specimens from NG PIS non-infected females was also included. Stability of archived specimens was evaluated. Some archived specimens were not tested due to volume limitation, therefore, in addition, Ct value distributions from the original study for archived tested specimens and specimens not tested due to volume limitations were reviewed. This analysis supported that the use of the archived specimens will provide an unbiased estimation of

a One or more positives in each NAAT (NAAT1 and NAAT2) designates the PIS as Infected. Any other combination of results defines the PIS as Not Infected. $^ { \mathsf { b } } \operatorname { I n }$ the scenario where one or more of the sample types are invalid, the remaining sample types with valid results from NAAT1 and NAAT2 must have concordant positive or concordant negative results to determine the PIS as Infected or Not Infected, respectively. For all other cases where one or more of the sample types are invalid, the PIS is indeterminate.

a If at least 2 out of the 3 test results are concordant positive or negative then the PIS can be considered as Infected or Not Infected, respectively. If one test result is invalid/missing and the other two test results are discordant then the PIS is indeterminate. If 2 or 3 test results are invalid/missing, then the PIS is indeterminate.

Primary objectives for the study included the evaluation of the sensitivity (SENS), specificity (SPEC), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV)

of cobas CT/NG for the detection of CT or NG using the PIS as the composite reference method and evaluated by gender, sample type, and symptom status. Predictive values were calculated based on overall sensitivity and specificity (with all data combined for males and females) for a range of hypothetical prevalence values.

Of the 5,197 subjects prospectively enrolled, 5,105 were eligible for inclusion. Of the 5,105 eligible subjects contributing prospective specimens, 5,053 $( 9 9 . 0 \% )$ (3,860 females and 1,193 males) were evaluable and were included in the data analyses. A total of 52 subjects $( 1 . 0 \% )$ were classified as non-evaluable and excluded from all statistical analyses because of deviations rendering samples non-evaluable, indeterminate PIS, or invalid cobas CT/NG results after initial testing and/or retesting. In addition, a total of 371 archived urogenital samples (urine, cervical specimens in PreservCyt, and endocervical swabs) prospectively collected from 295 female subjects were tested in this clinical study.

Of the 17,169 fresh prospective samples tested in this study (including 281 samples that required repeat testing), 19 samples exhibited invalid results on the first run (invalid rate of $0 . 1 1 \%$ $9 5 \%$ CI: $0 . 0 7 \%$ ; $0 . 1 7 \% )$ ). Upon repeat testing, 3 samples exhibited valid results.

# Clinical Study Results for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT)

Tables 22 and 23 summarize the results from symptomatic and asymptomatic female and male subjects designated as infected or non-infected with CT according to the PIS algorithm. A total of 271 females and 118 males were infected with CT. Symptoms were reported in $45 . 8 \%$ (124/271) of infected and $3 6 . 7 \%$ (1318/3589) of non-infected women. Similarly, symptoms were reported in $5 3 . 4 \%$ (63/118) of infected and $2 2 . 5 \%$ (242/1074) of non-infected men.

# Clinical Study Results for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG)

Tables 25 and 26 summarize the results from symptomatic and asymptomatic female and male subjects designated as infected or non-infected with NG according to the PIS algorithm. A total of 57 females and 87 males were infected with NG. Symptoms were reported in $45 . 6 \%$ (26/57) of infected and $3 7 . 2 \%$ (1416/3803) of non-infected females.

a Symp $=$ symptomatic, Asymp $=$ asymptomatic. b Infected (Urine), Non-Infected (Swabs). Note: In the scenario where one or more of the sample types are invalid/not available (NA), for female subjects, the remaining sample types with valid results from NAAT1 and NAAT2 must have concordant positive or concordant negative results to determine the PIS as Infected or Not Infected, respectively. For all other cases where one or more of the sample types are invalid/not available (NA), the PIS is indeterminate. Note: Female subjects with designated infection status (Infected or Non-Infected) and final valid cobas CT/NG test results are considered evaluable and included in this summary table. Note: $^ +$ denotes Positive, - denotes Negative, NA denotes Not Available. Note: UR $=$ urine, ${ \mathrm { V S } } =$ vaginal swab, $\mathrm { P C } =$ PreservCyt, $\mathrm { E S = }$ endocervical swab. Note: cobas Invalid are the sum of instrument amplification/detection errors and samples excluded due to protocol deviations.

a NAAT1, NAAT2, and NAAT $\ 3 =$ FDA-cleared CT/NG Assays b Symp $=$ symptomatic, Asymp $=$ asymptomatic. \*One subject was missing symptom status and is not included in this table. Note: If at least 2 out of the 3 test results, for male subjects, are concordant positive or negative then the PIS can be considered as infected or non-infected, respectively. If one test result is invalid/not available (NA) and the other two test results are discordant then the PIS is indeterminate. If 2 or 3 test results are invalid/not available, then the PIS is indeterminate. Note: Male subjects with designated patient infection status (Infected or Non-Infected) and final valid cobas CT/NG test results are considered evaluable and included in this summary table. Note: $^ +$ denotes Positive, - denotes Negative, NA denotes Not Available. Note: UR $=$ urine. Note: cobas Invalid are the sum of instrument amplification/detection errors and samples excluded due to protocol deviations.

Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of cobas CT/NG for NG as defined by PIS are presented by gender, sample type, and symptom status in Table 27 (prospective and archived prospectively collected specimens).

a UR $=$ urine, VS-C $=$ clinician-collected vaginal swab, ${ \mathrm { V S } } { \cdot } { \mathrm { S } } =$ self-collected vaginal swab, $\mathrm { P C } =$ PreservCyt, $\mathrm { E S = }$ endocervical swab. b Symp $=$ symptomatic, Asymp $=$ asymptomatic. c Five NG PIS infected females had a NG negative urine specimen with NAAT1 and NAAT2 while they had a NG positive vaginal swab with NAAT1 and NAAT2 \* One subject was missing symptom status and is not included in this table. Note: In the scenario where one or more of the sample types are invalid/not available, for female subjects, the remaining sample types with valid results from NAAT1 and NAAT2 must have concordant positive or concordant

negative results to determine the PIS as Infected or Non-Infected, respectively. For all other cases where one or more of the sample types are invalid/ not available, the PIS is indeterminate.

Note: If at least 2 out of the 3 test results, for male subjects, are concordant positive or negative then the PIS can be considered as Infected or Non-Infected, respectively. If one test result is invalid/not available and the other two test results are discordant then the PIS is indeterminate. If 2 or 3 test results are invalid/not available, then the PIS is indeterminate.

Note: Subjects with designated patient infection status (Infected or Non-Infected) and final valid cobas CT/NG test results are considered evaluable and included in this summary table. An evaluable subject may not have all available sample types or valid test results.

Note: Archived prospectively collected specimens were from COB-CTNG-282 study and included female PIS positive subjects that have available sample with adequate volume for testing.

Note: $\mathrm { C I } =$ confidence interval, $\mathrm { P R E V = }$ prevalence, SENS $=$ sensitivity, SPEC $=$ specificity, $\mathrm { P P V } =$ positive predictive value, $\mathrm { N P V } =$ negative predictive value.

# 4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

# 5. Expected values/Reference range:

The prevalence of CT and NG in patient populations depends on a variety of factors including age, gender, the presence of symptoms, clinic type, and test method. The positivity rate of CT observed with cobas CT/NG during this multi-site clinical study was $7 . 2 \%$ overall. The overall positivity rate of NG observed with cobas CT/NG for the prospective and archived prospectively collected samples was $2 . 7 \%$ .

The following two tables illustrate hypothetical positive and negative predictive values for the detection of CT and NG with cobas CT/NG for potential prevalence of 1 to $50 \%$ . The overall sensitivity and specificity used for these calculations were derived from the clinical study results for all specimen types and females and males combined (prospective specimens only).
