In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR

803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm.

# 1. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay is a two-step sandwich immunoassay with streptavidin microparticles and an electrochemiluminescence detection system. PCT in the sample reacts with these labeled antibodies to form a sandwich complex. This complex binds to streptavidin coated magnetic microparticles, which are magnetically captured onto an electrode. Application of voltage to the electrode induces chemiluminescence which is measured by a photomultiplier tube. Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument-specifically generated by 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode. An optional Procalcitonin CalCheck product is also available.

# 1.1. Reagents

The reagent working solutions include:

Rackpack (kit placed on analyzer)

• M: Streptavidin-coated microparticles, • R1: Anti-PCT-Ab\~biotin • R2: Anti-PCT – Ab\~Ru(bpy) 2 +

# 4.1. Precision

The repeatability and intermediate precision of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was conducted using the cobas e 411 analyzer. Studies were performed in accordance with CLSI guideline EP5- A3, “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods”. One reagent lot was evaluated. The precision study was conducted using the study design of 21 days x 2 runs per day x 2 replicates per sample. One (1) instrument was used for the study and calibration was performed according to the Instructions for Use. Aliquots of sixteen (16) human serum samples and two (2) QC samples (PC PCT 1 and PC PCT 2) distributed over the measuring range were assayed in duplicate and randomized order on the cobas e 411 analyzer using one lot of reagent. Data is acceptable and is summarized below. An analysis was also performed to calculate $\%$ Total Error across the measuring range.

# 4.2. Endogenous Interferences

The effect on quantitation of PCT in the presence of five endogenous interfering substances (Hemoglobin, Biotin, Intralipid, Bilirubin, and Rheumatoid Factor) was tested using one cobas e 411 analyzer. Spiked serum pools were used for testing. The substances were found not to affect test performance at clinically relevant concentrations. Recovery was within $\pm 1 5 \%$ of the initial value. See K160729 for additional interference data.

$^ { * } =$ value below measurable range

\*\* Specimens with biotin concentrations up to $3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ demonstrated $\leq 1 3 \%$ bias in results. Biotin concentrations greater than $3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ can lead to higher negative bias for PCT results. The recommended daily intake for biotin is $3 0 ~ \mu \ g$ . Higher doses of biotin $\mathrm { ( > 1 0 ~ m g }$ per day) may be taken as a dietary supplement aimed at reducing hair loss or improving nail or skin condition.13

Some pharmacokinetic studies have shown that serum concentrations of biotin can reach $3 5 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ for subjects taking supplements containing at least $2 0 \mathrm { m g }$ of biotin14 or $1 1 6 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for subjects taking doses of biotin up to $3 0 0 \mathrm { m g } . 1 3$ These studies were performed in healthy subjects, and some patients may be taking supplements with biotin at levels greater than $2 0 \mathrm { m g }$ per day. Clearance of biotin could be different in patients tested with this device, which may lead to higher than expected concentrations of biotin in serum.

# 4.3. Exogenous Interferences – Drugs

The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of drugs was determined by comparing values obtained from samples spiked with 38 pharmaceutical compounds into two human serum samples at differing analyte concentrations and tested on the cobas e 411 analyzer. The substances were found not to affect test performance at clinically relevant concentrations. Recovery was within $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the reference value. See K160729 for additional interference data.

# 4.4. Clinical Performance Evaluation - Method Comparison to Predicate

The Elecsys $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ B•R•A•H•M•S PCT clinical performance study was conducted by retrospective multicenter testing of PCT from available frozen samples of adult patients (i.e. ${ > } 1 8$ years of age) diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock who were enrolled in the BRAHMS MOSES study from the Intensive Care Unit or the emergency department, other wards or directly from out of hospital and subsequently admitted to the ICU.

The clinical concordance analysis in this report was performed with all available valid test results obtained in the Elecsys $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ B·R·A·H·M·S PCT clinical performance study. The clinical line data of the BRAHMS MOSES study is available via MAF2386 (Amendment 9 – Clinical Line Data). The line listings of the Elecsys B·R·A·H·M·S PCT clinical performance study was included in K160729.

The clinical concordance analysis of the Elecsys B·R·A·H·M·S PCT clinical performance study shows more than $9 7 \%$ total agreement between the Elecsys B·R·A·H·M·S PCT and the B•R•A•H•M•S PCT sensitive Kryptor $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ (predicate device) at the medical decision points 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and $2 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The regression slopes are within $+ / - 1 0 \%$ of identity in Passing-Bablok and Weighted Deming Analysis. This demonstrates equivalence to the predicate device to include all currently cleared claims of the predicate device in the labeling of the candidate device.

# 5. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The calibration materials PCT Cal1 and PCT Cal2 as well as the control material PreciControl PCT1 and PreciControl PCT2 are in the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT kit and are not changed as a result of the new claims. The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT CalCheck 5 is also not changed as a result of the change. See K160729 for additional information.

# 6. CONCLUSIONS

The information provided in this 510(k) Premarket Notification will support a determination of substantial equivalence for the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT test system. The data supports a safe, effective device which performs as well as or better than the predicate device.
