# H. Intended Use/ Indications for Use:

# 1. Intended Use/ Indications for Use:

Immunoassay for the in vitro quantitative determination of PCT (procalcitonin) in human serum and plasma (K2 –EDTA, K3-EDTA and Li-Heparin).

The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” is intended for use on Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.

Used in conjunction with other laboratory findings and clinical assessments, Elecsys BRAHMS PCT is intended for use as follows:

to aid in the risk assessment of critically ill patients on their first day of ICU admission for progression to severe sepsis and septic shock, to determine the change in PCT level over time as an aid in assessing the cumulative 28-day risk of all-cause mortality for patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock in the ICU or when obtained in the emergency department or other medical wards prior to ICU admission, · to aid in decision making on antibiotic therapy, for inpatients or patients in the emergency department with suspected or confirmed lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) – defined as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute bronchitis, and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), to aid in decision making on antibiotic discontinuation for patients with suspected or confirmed sepsis.

2. Special conditions for use statement(s):

For prescription use only

Warnings and Precautions:

The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay should not be used as a sole basis for diagnosis for determining the risk of 28 day all-cause mortality. Changes in PCT should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical status of the patient and other laboratory results. There is no uniformly recognized interpretation of the change in PCT levels for the prediction of mortality, and overall mortality is strongly dependent on many factors, including pre-existing patient risk factors and clinical course. The need for continued ICU care at Day 4 and other covariates (e.g., age, sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA score) are also significant predictors of 28-day cumulative mortality risk. Validation of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay as an aid in predicting mortality was performed in a study population with an overall 28-day mortality of $22 \%$ .

3. Special instrument requirements:

The submission demonstrates performance on the cobas e411 immunoassay analyzer.

# L. Test Principle:

The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay is a two-step sandwich immunoassay with streptavidin microparticles and an electrochemiluminescence detection system. The test system reagents contain a biotinylated monoclonal PCT-specific antibody and a ruthenium labeled monoclonal PCT-specific antibody.

Total assay duration: 18 minutes.

1st incubation: Antigen in the sample $( 3 0 \mu \mathrm { L } )$ , a biotinylated monoclonal PCT-specific antibody, and a monoclonal PCT-specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium complex\*) reac to form a sandwich complex. 2nd incubation: After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin. − The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then removed. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier. Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument specific, generated by 2- point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

# Exogenous Interference:

Fifteen pharmaceutical compounds were spiked into two human serum sample pools of different PCT concentrations. Each serum sample was evaluated both with and without the potential interference substances and tested with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer.

The following substances evaluated with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay were found not to affect the test performance at concentrations reasonably and consistently found in clinical situations.

See K160729 for additional interference studies.

HAMA Effect:

See K160729 for study design and data.

There was no HAMA interference observed.

i. High-Dose Hook Effect:

There was no observed high-dose hook effect at PCT concentrations up to $1 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ PCT.

j. Assay Cut-off:

28-day mortality:

· $\Delta \mathbf { P C T } \leq 8 0 \%$

A decrease in the PCT levels below or equal to $80 \%$ defines a positive ΔPCT test result representing a higher risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock.

$\Delta \mathrm { P C T } > 8 0 \%$

A decrease in the PCT levels of more than $80 \%$ defines a negative ΔPCT test result representing a lower risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock.

NOTE: The combination of the first PCT level $( \leq 2 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } \mathrm { o r } > 2 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ at initial diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock with the patient’s clinical course and the change in PCT level over time until Day 4 provides important additional information about the mortality risk.

Progression Risk:

· $\mathbf { P C T } > 2 \ \mathbf { \mu g / L }$ A PCT level above $2 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / L }$ on the first day of ICU admission is associated with a high risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock. $\mathbf { P C T < 0 . 5 \mu g / L }$ A PCT level below $0 . 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / L } }$ on the first day of ICU admission is associated with a low risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.

LRTI Antibiotic Decision Making:

· $\mathbf { P C T < 0 . 1 0 \ n g / m L }$ Antibiotic therapy strongly discouraged.   
· PCT 0.10-0.25 ng/mL Antibiotic therapy discouraged.   
· PCT 0.26-0.50 ng/mL Antibiotic therapy encouraged. PCT $\mathrm { > } 0 . 5 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ Antibiotic therapy strongly encouraged.

Sepsis Antibiotic Discontinuation:

· $\Delta \mathrm { P C T } > 8 0 \%$ Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued $\mathbf { P C T \leq 0 . 5 0 \ n g / m L }$ Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued

Recommendations for Laboratory Reports for Initiation and Discontinuation:

The Change in Procalcitonin Calculator is available at http://www.brahms-pct-calculator.com. The Change in Procalcitonin Calculator can be used to determine ΔPCT results. It is suggested to report the numerical PCT values (individual or paired). For paired PCT values the report should also indicate if the $\Delta P C \mathrm { T } ( \% )$ was $\leq 8 0 \%$ or $> 8 0 \%$ . The laboratory report should include a reference or a link to the package insert for a guided interpretation of the test results.

k. Specimen Stability: Refer to K160729 for stability data.   
l. Sample Matrix Comparison: See K160729 for study design and data. SST is an acceptable sample type for use with the Elecsys PCT assay Li-Heparin plasma is an acceptable sample type for use with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay K2-EDTA plasma is an acceptable sample type for use with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay. K3-EDTA plasma is an acceptable sample type for use with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay.

2. Clinical Studies:

The clinical performance of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was establishing with multicenter testing of retrospective specimens available as frozen samples from adult patients (i.e., ${ > } 1 8$ years of age) diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock who were enrolled in the BRAHMS MOSES study from the Intensive Care Unit, the emergency department, other wards or directly from out of hospital and subsequently admitted to the ICU.

The clinical concordance analysis in this report was performed with all available valid test results obtained in the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT clinical performance study. The line listings of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT clinical performance study were included in K160729.

The clinical concordance analysis of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT clinical performance study shows more than $9 7 \%$ total agreement between the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT and the BRAHMS PCT sensitive Kryptor (predicate device) at the medical decision points 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 2.0 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The regression slopes are within $+ / - 1 0 \%$ of identity in Passing-Bablok and Weighted Deming Analysis. This demonstrates equivalence to the predicate device.
