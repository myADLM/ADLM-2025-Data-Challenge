# SPECIAL 510(K): DEVICE MODIFICATION OIR DECISION SUMMARY

# 510(k) Number: K173932

This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the applicant’s own class II or class I devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:

1. The name and 510(k) number of the applicant’s previously cleared device. (For a preamendments device, a statement to this effect has been provided.)

2. Applicant’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or promotional materials (labeling changes are permitted as long as they do not affect the intended use).

3. Description of the device MODIFICATION(S):

This change was for a modification of the Alere i Influenza A & B, Alere i Strep A, Alere i RSV, and Alere i Influenza A & B 2 algorithm was made to mitigate issues with false invalid results due to baselines that are lower than allowed by the algorithm and incorrectly identified as Empty Tube Values. The Norm Window baseline minimum setting was changed from $1 . 0 \mathrm { m V / s }$ to $0 . 1 \mathrm { m V / s }$ for each of the assays identified above. This is an algorithm update only, there have been no changes made to the chemistry of the assays.

The only impact of this change is related to invalid results, the threshold for positive and negative results has not changed and there is no change to assay performance. There are no changes to the user interface and no changes to product labeling are required. The Intended Use of Alere i Influenza A & B, Alere i Strep A, Alere i RSV, and Alere i Influenza A & B 2 as described in the 510k cleared labeling, has not changed because of this modification. The modification does not alter the fundamental technology of the Alere i Influenza A & B, Alere i Strep A, Alere i RSV, and Alere i Influenza A & B 2 assays or the Alere i Instrument.

The unmodified and modified devices are identical in assay formulation and there has been no change in the test procedure. The only changes are to the software as described above.

# 4. The FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.

5. Comparison Information (similarities and differences) to applicant’s legally marketed predicate device including labeling, intended use, physical characteristics, and assay information:

# Differences

# Alere i Influenza A&B

The Alere i Influenza A & B package insert will have the following footnote to the table for the original cross-reactivity study to reflect subsequent additional cross-reactivity information—

\*Some cross-reactivity was observed for Proteus vulgaris at concentrations greater than $7 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ , Moraxella catarrhalis at concentrations greater than $\bar { 2 } \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 9 } \mathrm { . }$ , and Serratia marcescens at concentrations greater than $3 \mathrm { \bf x } 1 0 ^ { 9 }$ .

# Alere i Influenza A&B 2

The Alere i package inserts will be updated to reflect the intended designation for room temperature storage. It will now state $1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for room temperature (previously this was defined as $1 8 \mathrm { - } 2 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ).

# 6. A Design Control Activities Summary:

A risk assessment of the modified Alere i Instrument software was conducted and documented according to the firm’s Quality System reqirements. This assessment included a standard Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). Base on this risk assessment, the modification made to the software embedded on the Alere i Instrument does not affect the assay procedure and the change is not expected to impact the performance of the test or its safety and effectiveness. Certain validation studies were conducted to confirm that the assay performance was not negatively impacted by the software modification. The following aspects of the system were analyzed:

Test workflows were verified to ensure they reflect the proper settings and configuration. Regression testing was performed to verify that the changes to Baseline values did not impact the core software. Code review was performed To ensure that changing the baseline did not affect previously collected data used to support regulatory submissions, and thus product claims, CSV and/or JSON files from verification and validations studies that were used to support product claims for each assay were re-analyzed. Each CSV and/or JSON file was processed by the on-board instrument algorithm via the software unit test framework. As an output of the onboard analysis, a summary of the results was generated.

The firm provided a summary of the results from these software validation studies.

# 7. Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary or Statement and the Indications for Use Enclosure.

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the applicant’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The applicant has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.
