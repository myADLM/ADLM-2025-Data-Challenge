Device Intended Use:

The Cepheid Xpert® Xpress Flu/RSV Assay, performed on the GeneXpert® Xpress System, is an automated, multiplex real-time, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay intended for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) viral RNA. The Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay uses nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and nasal swab (NS) specimens collected from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infections in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.

Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2016-2017 influenza season when influenza A/H3N2 and A/HINI pandemic were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other novel influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

# Ancillary Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimen Collection Kit for Viruses

The Xpert® Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit is designed to collect, preserve, and transport nasopharyngeal swab specimens and to preserve and transport nasal aspirate/wash specimens containing viruses from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection prior to analysis with the Xpert Flu Assay or the Xpert Flu/RSV XC Assay.

The Xpert $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit is designed to collect, preserve, and transport nasopharyngeal swab specimens containing viruses from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection prior to analysis with the Xpert Flu+RSV Xpress Assay, Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay or the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay.

Ancillary Nasal Swab Specimen Collection Kit for Viruses

The Xpert® Nasal Sample Collection Kit is designed to collect, preserve, and transport nasal swab specimens containing viruses from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection prior to analysis with the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay and the Xpert Xpress Flu Assay.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For Prescription Use Only   
4. Special instrument requirements: Gene Xpert Xpress System

# I. Device Description:

This assay uses nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. Viral nucleic acid is extracted from the sample and the influenza A, influenza B, and/or RSV viral RNA is amplified and detected through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Detection and differentiation of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV is reported to the user. The user also has the ability to choose to run the assay for Flu A and B only or RSV only. If the user chooses one of these options the assay proceeds as normal, but only the selected assay results are reported.

The assay uses single use disposable cartridge that has a separate section for specimen loading. The cartridge also contains all PCR reagents and it is where the PCR reaction takes place. The GeneXpert Xpress System performs all assay steps from clinical sample to reporting assay results automatically. A Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) are also included in the cartridge. The SPC is present to control for adequate processing of the target viruses and to monitor for the presence of inhibitors in the PCR reaction. The Probe Check Control (PCC) verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability.

The GeneXpert Xpress System, comprised of the GeneXpert Dx System GX-II, which has two modules capable of performing separate sample preparation, real-time PCR, and RT-PCR tests, or the GX-IV which has four modules. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids (i.e., the syringe drive activates the plunger that works in concert with the rotary valve in the cartridge to move fluids between chambers), an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells, and a proprietary thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and RT-PCR and detection.

Turnaround time for analysis of a sample is approximately 30 minutes or less. The assay results are automatically generated at the end of the process and provided in a report that can be viewed and printed.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Respiratory Viral Panel Multiplex Nucleic Acid Assay

# L. Test Principle:

The assay detects viral nucleic acids that have been extracted from a patient respiratory sample. A multiplex Real-time RT-PCR reaction is carried out under optimized conditions generating amplicons for influenza A, influenza B, RSV and the Sample Process Control (SPC). Identification of influenza A, influenza B, RSV and the SPC occurs by the use of targetspecific primers and fluorescent-labeled probes that hybridize to conserved regions in the genomes.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

A portion of the analytical studies were conducted for and described in submission K163221. All testing was performed using the same assay, Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay, no changes to the assay were made since the 510(k) clearance of K163221. Previous studies were conducted with the GeneXpert Dx System using GeneXpert Xpress Software v4.6a. For the current submission the data from all analytical studies (except LoD and Swab Equivalency Study) were re-analyzed with the new software, GeneXpert Xpress Software version 5.0, on the Gene Xpert Xpress System instruments GX-II and GX-IV. No changes were detected in the analytical study data analyses conducted with the new software version used with the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay and Gene Xpert Xpress Sytem described in this submission.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

# Precision

Please refer to the Decision Summary for submissions K163221.

# Reproducibility

A multi-center study was conducted at 3 sites with 3 operators at each site. Each operator tested a 7-member blinded panel 2 times per day over 5 testing days. One lot of Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay reagents was used for this study. All sites used the GeneXpert Xpress IV Instrument System using the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV ADF (assay definition file) v3. Re-analysis of the data was performed using the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV ADF v4, no changes to the test results were observed after analysis with the new ADF version.

The ADF was modified to address occasional signal loss detection errors and noisy amplification curves observed by users of the Xpert Xpress suite of assays offered by Cepheid. These changes are documented in a separate 510(k) submission K181289.

The panel members were comprised of influenza A (Flu A), influenza B (Flu B), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) viral isolates spiked into simulated matrix. The panel member composition, with viral titer, is listed in the table below.

aOne Flu A Low Positive specimen was indeterminate upon initial and retest.

All negative samples produced a negative result (90/90).

All moderate positive samples produced a positive result [Flu A (90/90) Flu B (90/90) and RSV (90/90)].

The low positive samples were prepared to target a concentration close the limit of detection (LoD) for both sample types. However, this resulted in the low positive samples having a titer lower than the LoD for the NP swab matrix. Overall, $9 1 . 0 \%$ (81/89) of the Flu A low positive samples, $9 3 . 3 \%$ (84/90) of the Flu B low positive samples and $9 1 . 0 \%$ (82/90) of the low RSV samples were classified as positive for the corresponding target. Based on the virus titer used and the LoD for the different sample types, the $91 \%$ and $93 \%$ positive results for the low positive samples are acceptable.

The reproducibility data was also analyzed based on the Ct data for each reaction. Total standard deviation for all targets was calculated as well as differences between site, between day, between operator and witin-assay. Variation did not exceed more than half the total standard deviation demonstrating high reproducibility of the assay.

# d. Detection limit:

Studies were performed to determine the analytical limit of detection (LoD) of the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay with two lots of reagents across three testing days. Testing was performed using the GeneXpert Xpress System using the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV ADF v3. Re-analysis of the data was performed using the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV ADF v4, no changes resulted from the new ADF version. The higher LoD observed per strain and per lot was selected for verification. Verification of the estimated LoD claim was performed on one reagent lot across a minimum of three testing days. LoD was established using two influenza A H3N2 strains, two influenza A $2 0 0 9 \mathrm { H } 1 \mathrm { N } 1$ strains, two influenza B strains, two RSV A strains and two RSV B strains. Viruses were diluted into negative pooled NP swab and NS clinical matrices for testing. The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration (tissue culture infective dose, $\mathrm { T C I D } 5 0 / \mathrm { m L }$ ) per sample that can be reproducibly distinguished from negative samples $9 5 \%$ of the time or the lowest concentration at which 19 of 20 replicates were positive. Each strain was tested in replicates of 20 per concentration of virus in each matrix, in NP swab and NS clinical matrix. The LoD point values for each strain tested are summarized in Tables below.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: N/A

b. Matrix comparison:

Equivalency study for NP swab clinical matrix and simulated matrix was described in K162331. This study was repeated for the NS clinical matrix to show equivalency between the nasal swab specimen and simulated matrix.

Simulated matrix consisted of $2 . 5 \%$ (w/v) porcine mucin, $1 \%$ (v/v) human whole blood in $0 . 8 5 \%$ sodium chloride (NaCl) formulated in $1 \mathrm { x }$ PBS solution with $1 5 \%$ glycerol, which was then diluted in UTM to a final concentration of $1 6 . 7 \%$ . The NS clinical matrix was created by pooling negative NS clinical matrix, then aliquoting the pooled matrix and spiking it with the appropriate virus. This study was performed by spiking the NS clinical matrix and simulated matrix with influenza strains and RSV at four different concentrations relative to the assay LoD: low positives (2X LoD), medium positives (5X LoD), and high positives (10X and 100X LoD). The virus strains used and their concentration are shown in the table below.

# Clinical Studies

The clinical study was conducted at 14 sites. Testing was performed on the GeneXpert Xpress System using the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV ADF v3. The data shown below represents a re-analysis of the original data using the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV ADF v4. The new analysis showed minimal impact on clinical results. As a result of the re-analysis, 7 samples that previously had valid results changed to invalid.

A total of 3576 specimens were enrolled in this clinical study, the number of specimens included in analysis differ for Flu A/B and RSV because two different comparator methods were used for these analytes. Specimens were collected from October 2016 through March 2017. Each patient provided either a nasal swab (NS) or a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimen. For nasal swab specimens, one swab was used to swab both nostrils, only one nostril was swabbed for the NP swab specimen. Specimens were prospectively collected fresh and tested as soon as possible after collection and within 24 hours. All samples were tested with the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV assay and an FDA cleared NAAT assay for Flu A/B and RSV.

There were 3545 specimens tested with the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV assay. There were 67 initially indeterminate Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV results (38 NO RESULT and 29 INSTRUMENT ERROR), 58 of those were re-tested to yield 53 valid results from repeat testing and 14 results remained indeterminate. The initial intdeterminate rate was $1 . 9 \%$ (67/3545), $9 5 \% C \mathrm { I }$ : $( 1 . 5 \% - 2 . 4 \% )$ . After re-testing the final indeterminate rate was $0 . 4 \%$ (14/3545), $9 5 \% C \mathrm { I }$ : $( 0 . 2 \% - 0 . 7 \% )$

For Flu A/B a total of 311 samples were excluded for the following reasons; 234 unresolved comparator result, 1 not tested with comparator, 6 with invalid comparator assay controls, 17 specimens frozen, 14 shipping problem, 9 incorrect specimen collection, 8 not tested with GX system, 14 indeterminate Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV result, 4 run on incorrect assay, and 4 not tested within protocol specified time period.

There were 3265specimens evaluated for Flu A and Flu B (1598 NS specimens and 1667 NP specimens); $54 . 8 \%$ from female subjects and $4 5 . 2 \%$ from male subjects).

For RSV, a total of 473 samples were excluded for the following reasons; 415 unresolved comparator result, 5 not tested with comparator, 14 shipping problem, 9 incorrect specimen collection, 8 not tested with GX system, 14 indeterminate Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV result, 4 run on incorrect assay, and 4 not tested within protocol specified time period.

The total number of eligible samples with valid RSV results was 3103 (1543 NS and 1560 NP swab); $5 5 . 1 \%$ from female subjects and $4 4 . 9 \%$ from male subjects.

The instrument systems each contain a computer and preloaded software for running tests and viewing the results.

# 3. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types.

4. Level of Concern

Moderate

5. Software Description

The GeneXpert Xpress (II and IV) Instrument Systems are provided with a computer, preloaded with software for running tests and viewing results. Each instrument contains random access, closed-system, computer-based software and embedded firmware which run dedicated microprocessor-controlled modules to integrate sample preparation, amplification and real-time detection in a single system. The GeneXpert Xpress software differs from the GeneXpert Dx software in its user interface which is simplified for use in CLIA waived environments.

The GeneXpert Instrument Systems are provided with a computer, preloaded with software for running tests and viewing results. Each instrument (Dx and Infinity) contains random access, closed-system, computer-based software and embedded firmware which run dedicated microprocessor-controlled modules to integrate sample preparation, amplification and real-time detection in a single system.

The GeneXpert Infinity modules contain extra robotic features for cartridge handling. The Xpertise software utilized by the Infinity Systems is the user interface and provides the ordering of tests as well as automates loading and unloading of cartridges into GeneXpert modules within the system. The Xpertise user interface builds upon the existing core software functionality for handling GeneXpert modules for cartridge fluidics control, temperature control, optics control, and data analysis by the addition of automation handling for the robotic arm.

# 6. Specimen Identification

Specimens are manually loaded into the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay cartridge by the user. The user can then either scan or type the sample and patient ID into the system. Prior to placing the cartridge into the GeneXpert Instrument System, the barcode on the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV Assay cartridge is scanned. The information contained in the assay barcode is utilized by the software to run the appropriate assay definition file (ADF). If an assay is being run that does not already exist in the GeneXpert database, the user must import the ADF before starting the test.

# 7. Calibration

Not required by user.

# Sample Processing Control

The sample processing control (SPC) is a non-infectious armored RNA pseudovirus that is included in each cartridge to verify that adequate processing of the sample has occurred. The SPC verifies that nucleic acids have been released from the target viruses if the organism is present and detects specimen-associated PCR and RT-PCR inhibitors. The SPC should be POSITIVE in a sample that is negative for influenza A, influenza , or for RSV target analytes, and can be NEGATIVE or POSITIVE in a sample containing detectable levels of one or all three of the target analytes.

# Probe Check Control

Before the start of the amplification process, the GeneXpert Instrument Systems measures the fluorescence signal from the probes to monitor bead rehydration, reaction tube filling, probe integrity, and dye stability. All assay reagents must be present and intact for the PCC to pass the validated acceptance criteria. If any of the PCC conditions fail, the result is reported as an ERROR and the test must be repeated using a new assay cartridge.
