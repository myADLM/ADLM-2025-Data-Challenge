# 510(k) Summary

This 510(k) summary is being submitted in accordance with the requirement of SMDA 1990 and 21 CFR 807.92.

1) Submitter’s Name: Gold Standard Diagnostics Address: 2851 Spafford St. Davis, CA. 95618 Phone Number: 530-759-8000 Contact Person: Napoleon Monce Date: January 26, 2018

2) Product and Trade Name: Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA Test Kit

Common Name: Lyme ELISA Test

Regulation Section: (21 CFR 866.3830) Treponema pallidum treponemal test reagents.

Classification: Class II

Product Code: LSR; Reagent, Borrelia Serological Reagent

3) Legally Marketed Device to Which the Submitter Claims Equivalence: Trinity Biotech Captia™ Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA Test Kit (K033070).

# 4) Description of the Device:

The kit includes $1 2 \times 8$ well Antigen Coated strips, Conjugate, Substrate, Stop Solution, Wash Buffer, Diluent, Negative Control, Positive Control, and Cutoff Control. The controls are provided to determine if the assay is functioning properly and to determine the antibody level. The reagents are sufficient for 96 determinations.

During the test procedure, antibodies to $B _ { \cdot }$ . burgdorferi (sensu stricto) if present in the human serum sample will bind to the antigens coated onto the wells forming antigen-antibody complexes. Excess antibodies are removed by washing. A conjugate of goat anti-human $\mathrm { I g G / I g M }$ antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase are then added, which binds to the antigen-antibody complexes. Excess conjugate is removed by washing. This is followed by the addition of a chromogenic substrate, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). If specific antibodies to the antigen are present in the patients’ serum, a blue color will develop. The enzymatic reaction is then stopped with a stopping solution causing the contents of the well to turn yellow. The wells are read photometrically with a microplate reader at $4 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .

The antigens used in the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA Test kit is a combination of $B$ . burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31 lysate, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain 2591 lysate, and a recombinant VlsE from $B .$ . burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31. The lysates use spirochetes growing in BSK-H complete medium until mid-exponential phase. The recombinant VlsE protein is produced in $E .$ . coli SURE2 cells and purified by affinity chromatography. The purity of each antigen is assayed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining and/or Western blotting.

# 5) Intended Use of the Device:

The Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi $\mathrm { I g G / I g M }$ ELISA Test kit is intended as a qualitative presumptive (first step) test for the detection of IgG and $\mathrm { I g M }$ antibodies to $B$ . burgdorferi sensu stricto in human serum from symptomatic patient or people suspected of infection. Positive and equivocal results must be supplemented by testing with a second-step Western blot assay.

# 6) Comparison with the Predicate Device:

The tables below provide a comparison of the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi $\mathrm { I g G / I g M }$ ELISA Test kit with the Trinity Biotech Captia™ Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA Test kit (predicate device: K033070).

# Determination of the Assay Cutoff

The cutoff was determined by testing a total of 200 normal sera which consisted of 100 sera from an endemic region of Lyme disease and 100 sera from a non-endemic region of Lyme disease. The mean plus two standard deviations was used to determine the assay cutoff. A known positive sample was then diluted to produce a ready to use cutoff control. After the cutoff was determined 125 characterized Lyme disease samples were tested. An ROC analysis was then generated with the 325 samples (200 normal and 125 characterized samples) to verify the chosen cutoff. The analysis confirmed that the assay cutoff provided an optimal level of sensitivity and specificity.

# Precision

To determine the precision of the Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA Test, a within-lab precision study was conducted. A precision panel consisting of a negative sample, a high negative sample, a low positive sample, and a moderate positive sample, along with the kit controls, was tested in-house. The sample panel was masked and randomized. Each of the panel members was tested in duplicate, twice per day, for 12 days. The sample panel was masked and randomized.

# Reproducibility

A reproducibility panel consisting of a negative sample, a high negative sample, a low positive sample, and a moderate positive sample, along with the kit controls, was tested at three different sites. The sample panel was masked and randomized. Each of the panel members was tested in triplicate, twice per day, for five days.

# Interfering Substances

The effect of potential interfering substances on samples using the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi $\mathrm { I g G / I g M }$ ELISA Test was evaluated. Three samples, a negative, a low positive and a moderate positive were spiked with high levels of interferants and were tested along with serum without spiked interferants. The recommended concentrations from the guideline “Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry EP7-A2” from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute were used (see table below).
