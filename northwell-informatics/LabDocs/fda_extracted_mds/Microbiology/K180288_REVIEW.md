2. Applicant’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed instructions for use.

3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S) in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.

1) QuickVue Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ Test was originally developed and manufactured using standard manual lateral flow techniques. This manual manufacturing process can result in quality lateral flow immunoassays, but can yield product with a high degree of variability due to the process parameters not being under tight control.

Quidel embarked on improving product consistency and performance by focusing on improving the way components were processed through automation, using a proprietary process called Web manufacturing. Web manufacturing is a continuous process that holds critical processing steps in tight control. The Web system ensures that every foot of product on the reel is exposed to conditions within specification limits. Any product that fails to meet product specifications are marked and removed from the lot prior to further processing. The better control of the manufacturing process parameters via the

implementation of the Web system led to significant improvements in product performance.

2) The product instructions for use (package insert) was updated to add the new clinical performance data generated using the modified QuickVue Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ Test (see Section 6 below) and to remove the old clinical performance data generated using the QuickVue Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ Test as previously FDA-cleared in K031899 and K053146.

3) The product instructions for use (package insert) was updated to remove nasal aspirate and nasal wash specimens from the list of claimed upper respiratory specimen types, and to add the relevant up to date FDA recommended warning and limitation statements

4. Comparison Information (similarities and differences) to applicant’s legally marketed predicate device.

# 5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:

a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis.

The Risk Assessment process used was based on an internal Quidel Risk Management Procedure (QIN002), which follows the requirements in ISO 14971.

Using this procedure, the primary failures/risks associated with transferring QuickVue Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ to the Web manufacturing process, as well as the process controls were analyzed.

b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.

Based on the Risk Analysis, Quidel followed its established internal procedures when developing, validating, and transferring QuickVue Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ to the Web manufacturing process . Several component level validations were completed. The primary validation encompassed testing multiple lots of components to demonstrate that the process controls were effective and that the entire product when manufactured on Web equipment met the manufacturing specifications.

In addition to this validation, a Stability Study was conducted that gathered both real-time and accelerated data.

Furthermore, Quidel conducted a new prospective clinical study using the modified devices to demonstrate that the performance of the modified QuickVue Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ Test meets the Class II performance special control specified in 21 CFR 866.3328. (See Section 6 below).

# 6. Clinical Performance

The clinical performance of the modified device was evaluated in a prospective multi-center field clinical study during two distinct influenza seasons in the United States, February through May 2017 and October 2017 through January 2018. Performance for influenza A was established when influenza A/H3 and A/H1pdm09 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation in the United States.

In this prospective clinical study, the performance of the modified QuickVue Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ Test was compared to an FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay. This study was conducted at five (5) clinical sites in the USA which represent CLIA waived testing environments comprised of Urgent Care, Pediatric, and General Practice offices. A total of forty-eight (48) operators from the five intended user sites participated in the study.

Two (2) nasal or two (2) nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from each of the 1183 patients enrolled in the study. All clinical samples were collected from symptomatic patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Thirty-nine percent $( 3 9 \% )$ of the patients tested were ${ < } 5$ years of age, forty-one percent $( 4 1 \% )$ $5 \mathrm { - } 1 8$ years of age, and twenty percent $( 2 0 \% ) { \geq } 1 8$ years of age. Forty-eight percent $(4 8 \% )$ were male and fifty-two percent $( 5 2 \% )$ were female.

On-site testing of one nasal swab or nasopharyngeal swab specimen in the QuickVue Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ Test was performed by CLIA waived test operators within one (1) hour of specimen collection. This swab specimen was incubated for one (1) minute with the Extraction Reagent Solution before addition of the dipstick. The other swab specimen was placed in viral transport media and stored at $2 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ prior to testing with the FDA-cleared influenza molecular assay.

Out of the 1183 nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens tested, there were no invalid QuickVue Influenza $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ Test results, but there were five (5) invalid comparator test results; therefore, 1178 evaluable specimens, including 924 nasopharyngeal swab specimen and 254 nasal swab specimens, were included in the performance analysis below.

# 7. Conclusion

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the applicant’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The applicant has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
