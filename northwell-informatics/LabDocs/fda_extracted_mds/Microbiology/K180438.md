BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu A + B – CLIA waived kit

# Indications for Use (Describe)

The BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathrm { A } { + } \mathrm { B }$ is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the direct and qualitative detection of influenza A and B viral nucleoprotein antigens from nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs of symptomatic patients. The BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathrm { A + B }$ (also referred to as the BD Veritor System and BD Veritor System Flu $\mathrm { A ^ { + } B }$ ) is a differentiated test, such that influenza A viral antigens can be distinguished from influenza B viral antigens from a single processed sample using a single device. The test is to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza A and B viral infections. A negative test is presumptive and it is recommended that these results be confirmed by viral culture or an FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay. Outside the U.S., a negative test is presumptive and it is recommended that these results be confirmed by viral culture or a molecular assay cleared for diagnostic use in the country of use. FDA has not cleared this device for use outside of the U.S. Negative test results do not preclude influenza viral infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. The test is not intended to detect influenza C antigens.

Performance characteristics for influenza A and B were established during January through March of 2011 when influenza viruses A/2009 H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria lineage, and B/Yamagata lineage were the predominant influenza viruses in circulation according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the CDC entitled “Update: Influenza Activity— United States, 2010-2011 Season, and Composition of the 2011-2012 Influenza Vaccine.” Performance characteristics may vary against other emerging influenza viruses.

If infection with a novel influenza virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to the state or local health department for testing. Virus culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION :

A. Summary   
The BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu $A { + } B$ is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the direct and qualitative detection of influenza A and B viral antigens from nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs of symptomatic patients. The test is to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza A and B viral infections. It is a differentiated test, such that influenza A viral antigens can be distinguished from influenza B viral antigens from a single processed sample using a single test device. Negative test results do not preclude influenza viral infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other management decisions. All negative test results should be confirmed by another methodology, such as a nucleic acid based method. All BD Veritor System Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ test devices are interpreted by a BD Veritor System Instrument, either a BD Veritor Reader or BD Veritor Plus Analyzer.

# B. Principle of the Test

The BD Veritor Flu $A { + } B$ test is an immuno-chromatographic assay for detection of influenza A and B viral antigens in samples processed from respiratory specimens. The viral antigens detected by the BD Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ test are nucleoprotein, not hemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA) proteins. Flu viruses are prone to minor point mutations (i.e., antigenic drift) in either one or both of the surface proteins (i.e., HA or NA). The BD Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ test is not affected by antigenic drift or shift because it detects the highly conserved nucleoprotein of the influenza viruses1,2 . To perform the test, the patient specimen swab is treated in a supplied reaction tube prefilled with a lysing agent that serves to expose the target viral antigens, and then expressed through a filter tip into the sample well on a BD Veritor Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ test device. Any influenza A or influenza B viral antigens present in the specimen bind to anti-influenza antibodies conjugated to colloidal gold micro-particles on the Veritor Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ test strip. The antigen-conjugate complex then migrates across the test strip to the capture zone and reacts with either Anti-Flu A or Anti-Flu B antibodies that are immobilized on the two test lines on the membrane.

The BD Flu $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ test device shown in Figure 1 is designed with five spatially-distinct zones including positive and negative control line positions, separate test line positions for the target analytes, and a background zone. The test lines for the target analytes are labeled on the test device as ‘A’ for flu A position, and ‘B’ for flu B position. The onboard positive control ensures the sample has flowed correctly and is indicated on the test device as $" C '$ . Two of the five distinct zones on the test device are not labeled. These two zones are an onboard negative control line and an assay background zone. The active negative control feature in each test identifies and compensates for specimen-related, nonspecific signal generation. The remaining zone is used to measure the assay background.

E. Veritor™ System Interpretation Instruments The BD Veritor System instruments use a reflectance-based measurement method and apply assay specific algorithms to determine the presence or absence of the target analyte. In the case of the Flu $\mathsf { A } + \mathsf { B }$ test, the BD Veritor System instruments subtract nonspecific signal at the negative control line from the signal present at both the Flu A and Flu B test lines. If the resultant line signal is above a pre-selected assay cutoff, the specimen scores as positive. If the resultant line signal is below the cutoff, the specimen scores as negative. Use of the active negative control feature allows the BD Veritor System instruments to correctly interpret test results that cannot be scored visually because the human eye is unable to accurately perform the subtraction of the nonspecific signal. The measurement of the assay background zone is an important factor during test interpretation as the reflectance is compared to that of the control and test zones. A background area that is white to light pink indicates the device has performed correctly. Sample preparation is the same for use with both instruments, and both can utilize the same kit components. Neither instrument requires calibration.

The Veritor Reader and the Veritor Plus Analyzer use the functional components and decision algorithm in the firmware. The BD Veritor Plus Analyzer has the flexibility of an optional bar code scanning module and cellular connectivity designed to facilitate record keeping as well as the addition of a “Walk Away” work flow mode. Depending on the configuration chosen by the operator, the Veritor Plus Analyzer communicates status and results to the operator via a liquid crystal display (LCD) on the instrument, a connected printer, or through a secure connection to the facility’s information system.

The following components are included with the BD Veritor™Instruments (purchased separately from Veritor Assays).

# SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE:

The modified BD Veritor™ System Flu $\mathsf { A } +$ B CLIA waived kit is substantially equivalent to the current legally marketed, BD Veritor™ System Flu $A { + } B$ CLIA waived kit. Additions made to the labeling to add the performance data table and to allow interpretation with the Veritor Plus Analyzer have changed neither the intended use of the device nor the fundamental scientific technology.

# RISK ASSESSMENT SUMMARY:

The BD Diagnostic Systems Risk Assessment process is based on the BD Risk Management procedure, which meets the requirement for risk management as set forth in ISO 14971:2007 and EN ISO 14971:2012. Using this procedure, the following are estimated:

the Hazard, the Adverse Effect (Harm to Patient), the Potential Causes of the Hazard, The probability of Hazard Severity and The probability of Occurrence

Based on a resulting calculated risk index, risk control measures are identified, required verification and validation activities are determined, and verification of the effectiveness of risk control measures is determined.

# RESULTS OF THE RISK ANALYSIS:

1. Addition of the inclusion of the additional performance table in the Clinical Performance section of the BD Veritor™ System Flu $\mathsf { A } +$ B CLIA-Waived assay product insert does not create any new product risks, or issues of safety and effectiveness.

Additions to labeling are as follows:

<table><tr><td>Change</td><td>Potential Impact of Change</td></tr><tr><td>Addition of performance data re- analyses</td><td>Additional information provided to users regarding performance of the device.</td></tr></table>

2. The risk assessment identified the need to confirm the Veritor Plus System’s ability to produce assay results equivalent to those obtained with the Veritor Reader in either Analyze Now or Walk Away work flow mode. The identified studies were performed according to appropriate design control procedures to assess the addition of the Veritor Plus Analyzer in either mode as an interpretation instrument for the Veritor System Flu $\mathsf { A } + \mathsf { B }$ CLIA-Waived assay product. The results of testing did not identify new issues of safety and effectiveness.

3. The risk assessment identified the need to confirm that the addition of the bar code scanning functions of InfoScan and InfoSync modules, and any associated screen displays, alerts and error messages had no effect on safety or effectiveness when the Veritor Plus Analyzer was used with the Veritor CLIA-waived Flu $\mathsf { A } + \mathsf { B }$ Assay. Software verification activities were performed and all testing criteria were met to confirm that changes and addtions made to firmware to add new functionality had no impact on the abiltiy of the instrument to give a correct assay result.

4. Cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities associated with the use of the InfoSync module were assessed and BD procedures and controls were verified as acceptable to protect user and patient data.

5. The risk assessment also identified the need to confirm that the Veritor Plus Analyzer was simple and easy to use in the CLIA waived environment.

# SUMMARY OF PERFORMANCE STUDIES:

At the BD Diagnostics Systems research and development center in San Diego, CA, staff performed studies on both analytical and clinical samples to confirm that the performance of the Veritor Plus Analyzer is equivalent to the Veritor Reader when used in both Read Now and Walk-Away modes.

These studies included:

Reproducibility studies o Samples with true zero values (no analyte) o High negative and low positive samples (near cut-off samples)

The data collected using analytical samples demonstrated that the percentage positivity for Veritor Readers and Veritor Plus Analyzers are equivalent.

The R&D staff also performed assessments of the following clinical samples:

102 Flu A-/B- samples • 52 Flu $\mathsf { A } +$ samples 52 Flu $\textsf { B + }$ samples

The data collected with clinical samples also indicate that assay results obtained using Veritor Readers and Veritor Plus Analyzers are either identical or statistically equivalent. Results included less than $2 \%$ either False Positive or False Negative results.
