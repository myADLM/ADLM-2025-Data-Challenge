1) The product package insert has been changed for the modified device reflecting the addition of a new performance table and related explanations in the Clinical Performance section. The following new performance table (appears as Table 1) is added in the revised product package insert:

# Table 1: Summary of Performance Data of the BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathbf { A } + \mathbf { B }$ Compared to PCR for All Swabs - All Sites

Note: The data in this table summarizes the performance of the Veritor Flu $\mathbf { A } + \mathbf { B }$ assay test system across all age groups, clinical testing sites and sample types. The $9 5 \%$ Confidence intervals are calculated using an analysis that accounts for sources of heterogeneity.

The sponsor provided the following justification for this modification:

Estimates of performance for Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Tests (RIDTs) as assessed from prospective clinical studies are subject to numerous sources of variability that are difficult to understand or control. The heterogeneity that is seen across RIDT clinical studies justifies a statistical analytical approach that accounts for additional variability over the basic binomial model, which assumes that all clinical studies and sites have the same performance. Literature supported examples of some of the potential sources of variability leading to the heterogeneity include:

· Variation in circulating influenza strains from within and across seasons since it is known that immunoassays have varying affinity to different strains.   
· Age of subjects with younger subjects demonstrating higher assay sensitivity.   
· Nostril-to-nostril variance in viral load, within the same subject, as it has been shown that there are significant differences in viral load from one nostril when compared to the other.   
· Swab-to-swab variability, since it is difficult to ensure identical quality when multiple swabs are collected, especially when patients may be less cooperative on the second swab.   
· Technician-to-technician variability in the way the specimen is collected.   
· Variability in time from onset of symptoms to diagnostic testing.   
· Positive vaccination status which has been demonstrated to result in reduced viral loads in patients with acute influenza infection, with further variation caused by differences in vaccine effectiveness from season to season.

Provided literature in this submission supports the widely acknowledged observation that RIDT studies are subjected to substantial variability which supports the application of statistical methods that are designed to account for this variability.

2) In addition to the BD Veritor Reader, a second generation instrument, the BD Veritor Plus Analyzer with the flexibility of an optional bar code scanning module and cellular connectivity designed to facilitate record keeping, was added to the product package insert. The BD Veritor Plus Analyzer also enables the addition of a “Walk Away” workflow mode.

# 5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:

a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis.

BD’s Risk Assessment process is based on a BD Product Risk Management procedure which meets the requirement for risk management as set forth in ISO 14971:2007 and EN ISO 14971:2012. Using this procedure, the following are estimated:

§ the hazard,   
§ the adverse effect (harm to patient), the potential causes of the hazard,   
− any existing control measure the probability of hazard severity and the probability of occurrence

b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.

Based on a resulting calculated risk index, risk control measures are identified, required verification and validation activities are determined, and verification of the effectiveness of risk control measures is determined.

1) The inclusion of the additional performance table in the Clinical Performance section of the BD Veritor System Flu $\mathbf { A } ^ { + }$ B (CLIA-Waived kit) product package insert (PI) does not create any new product risks. There has been no change in the product formulation. The change is exclusively a labeling change, specifically the addition of a table presenting combined data from both U.S. and Japanese clinical study sites and the resulting sensitivity and specificity calculations. The current performance observed by customers will not change as there is no change to the design or production process for this product. Therefore, because the addition of a new performance table does not impact the risk associated with the device, the current risk assessment table will not change.

A change control will be initiated to document this activity in the design history file and to route the new PI for approval. Modifications to the product package insert will be implemented in accordance to BD Change Control Procedure BDDSQP0402.

2) The risk assessment identified the need to confirm the Veritor Plus Analyzer’s ability to produce assay results equivalent to those obtained with the Veritor Reader in either “Analyze Now” or “Walk Away” workflow mode. The identified studies were performed according to appropriate design control procedures to assess the addition of the Veritor Plus Analyzer in either mode as an interpretation instrument for the Veritor System Flu $\mathbf { A } + \mathbf { B }$ CLIA-Waived assay product. The results of testing did not identify new issues of safety and effectiveness.

At the BD Diagnostics Systems research and development (R&D) center in San Diego, CA, BD staff performed studies testing both analytical and clinical samples to confirm that the performance of the Veritor Plus Analyzer is equivalent to the Veritor Reader when used in both “Read Now” and “Walk-Away” modes.

BD R&D staff tested the following analytical samples · Samples with true zero values (no analyte) · High negative and low positive samples (near cut-off samples)

The data collected testing the analytical samples demonstrated that the average numerical values and percentage positivity for Veritor Plus Analyzers when used in both “Read Now” and “Walk-Away” workflow modes are equivalent to Veritor Readers.

BD R&D staff also tested the following clinical samples:

102 Flu A-/B- samples · 52 Flu $\mathbf { A } ^ { + }$ samples 52 Flu $\mathrm { B ^ { + } }$ samples

The data collected with clinical samples also indicate that assay results obtained using Veritor Plus Analyzers (in both “Read Now” and “Walk-Away” workflow modes) are equivalent to Veritor Readers.

The risk assessment also identified the need to confirm that the addition of the bar code scanning functions of InfoScan and InfoSync modules, and any associated screen displays, alerts and error messages had no effect on safety or effectiveness when the Veritor Plus Analyzer was used with the Veritor CLIA-waived Flu $\mathbf { A } + \mathbf { B }$ Assay. Software verification activities were performed and all testing criteria were met to confirm that changes and additions made to firmware to add new functionality had no impact on the ability of the instrument to generate a correct assay result. Cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities associated with the use of the InfoSync module were assessed and BD procedures and controls were verified as acceptable to protect user and patient data.

# 6. Conclusion

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modifications. In addition, the applicant’s description of the particular modifications and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The applicant has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
