The Aptima Combo 2 Assay is a target amplification nucleic acid probe test that utilizes target capture for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) from Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) to aid in the diagnosis of chlamydial and/or gonococcal urogenital disease using the Panther System as specified.

On the Panther System, the assay may be used to test the following specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals: clinician-collected endocervical, vaginal and male urethral swab specimens, clinician-collected gynecological specimens collected in the PreservCyt Solution, patient-collected vaginal swab specimens,1 and female and male urine specimens.

1Patient-collected vaginal swab specimens are an option for screening women when a pelvic exam is not otherwise indicated. The vaginal and multitest swab specimen collection kits are not for home use.

2. Indication(s) for use: Same as Intended Use.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For Prescription Use

4. Special instrument requirements: Panther System

# I. Device Description:

The Aptima Combo 2 Assay is a target amplification nucleic acid probe test that utilizes target capture, transcription mediated amplification, and dual kinetic assay technologies for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of rRNA from CT and/or GC to aid in the diagnosis of chlamydial and/or gonococcal urogenital disease using the Panther System.

The current Aptima Combo 2 Assay is similar to the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay originally cleared (K111409) for use on the Panther System. There are no changes to the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay (Panther System) catalog numbers (303094 and 302923), accessories, or ancillary kits. The ‘Aptima Urine Specimen Collection Kit for Male and Female Urine Specimens’ (catalog number 301040) cleared for use with the cleared Aptima Combo 2 Assay on the DTS System (K003395), TIGRIS System (K032194), and Panther System (K132251) is required to collect the female urine specimens.

3. Clinical studies:

The clinical perofrmance of the Aptima Combo 2 Assay with female urine specimens was evaluated against a composite comparator algorithm (CCA) comprised of three FDA-cleared nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). A subject was considered positive if two out of three comparator NAATs were positive. The subject was considered negative if two out of three NAATs were negative. CCA result was determined for CT and GC using urine test results from upto three FDA-cleared CT/GC NAATs. The clinical data from a previously completed prospective clinical study was renalayzed and the remnant female urine samples were tested by a third FDA-cleared NAAT (tie-breaker) if the first two comparator NAAT results for urine samples did not determine the CCA result.

A total of 2640 women (symptomatic and asymptomatic) were enrolled from 17 geographically and ethically diverse US clinical sites. Of the 2640 subjects enrolled, 42 subjects were withdrawn. Of the 2598 non-withdrawn subjects, 2581 subjects were tested with the Aptima Combo 2 assay (Panther System) while 17 subjects had urine samples withdrawn or not collected, i.e., missing both CT and GC results from Aptima Combo 2 Assay (Panther System). Samples with initially invalid, equivocal, or error results were retested. All 2581 samples had final valid results after required retesting. One out of 2581 samples had a repeat CT equivocal result (negative GC result) and one sample had a repeat GC equivocal result (negative CT result). Of the 2581 subjects that had valid Aptima Combo 2 Assay (Panther System) results, 2580 subjects had a conclusive CT and/or GC CCA result and were evaluable for performance analyses; one subject had unknown CCA result for both CT and GC. Demographics of the 2580 evaluable subjects are presented in Table 3.

Of the 2580 evaluable subjects, 2572 subjects had a conclusive CT CCA result and were evaluable for performance analyses for CT detection (including one with equivocal result with Aptima Combo 2 Assay). The remaining eight subjects had an unknown composite comparator status. Of the 2580 evaluable subjects, 2579 subjects had a conclusive GC CCA result and were evaluable for performance analyses for GC detection (including one with equivocal result with Aptima Combo 2 Assay). The remaining one subject had an unknown composite comparator status.

Results from female urine samples with the Aptima Combo 2 Assay (Panther system) were compared to the CCA results to establish the positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA). Samples with final equivocal results were included in the performance analyses and categorized as false negative relative to the CCA result. Additionally, results in urine samples by Aptima Combo 2 Assay (Panther System) were also compared with the vaginal and endocervical swab specimens using the patient infected status (PIS) algorithm. In the Clinical Study, the Aptima Combo 2 Assay detected $8 . 3 \%$ fewer CT infections in female urine than in vaginal and endocervical swab specimens and $1 2 . 9 \%$ fewer GC infections than in vaginal swab specimens and $1 5 . 2 \%$ fewer GC infections than in endocervical swab specimens when compared to PIS algorithm.

Tables 4 and 5 show the PPA and NPA of the Aptima Combo 2 Assay for CT and GC detection based on the CCA in female urine samples.

Furthermore, very high agreement was observed between Aptima Combo 2 assay (Panther System) and CCA result for the detection of CT in female urine samples. Therefore, the performance of Aptima Combo 2 Assay (Panther System) based on the CCA in female urine specimens was acceptable.
