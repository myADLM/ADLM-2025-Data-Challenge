The Atellica® IM BRAHMS Procalcitonin (PCT) assay is for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of procalcitonin in human serum and plasma (EDTA, lithium heparin, and sodium heparin) using the Atellica® IM Analyzer.

The Atellica IM BRAHMS PCT assay is intended for use, in conjunction with other laboratory findings and clinical assessments, as an aid in:

• The risk assessment of critically ill patients on their first day of ICU admission for progression to severe sepsis and septic shock.

• Assessing the cumulative 28‑day risk of all-cause mortality for patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock in the ICU or when obtained in the emergency department or other medical wards prior to ICU admission, using percent change in PCT level over time.

• Decision-making on antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected or confirmed lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) – defined as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute bronchitis, and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) – in an inpatient setting or an emergency department.

• Decision-making on antibiotic discontinuation for patients with suspected or confirmed sepsis.

10. Special Conditions for use statement(s): For Prescription Use Only

11. Warnings and Precautions for Test Interpretation:

The Atellica® IM BRAHMS Procalcitonin (PCT) assay is not indicated to be used as a stand-alone diagnostic assay and should be used in conjunction with clinical signs and symptoms of infection and other diagnostic evidence.

Decisions regarding antibiotic therapy should NOT be based solely on PCT concentrations.

PCT results should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical status of the patient and other laboratory results. Changes in PCT levels for the prediction of mortality, and overall mortality, are strongly dependent on many factors, including pre-existing patient risk factors and clinical course.

The need to continue ICU care at Day 4 and other covariates, such as age and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, are also significant predictors of 28‑day cumulative mortality risk.

PCT levels may not be elevated in patients infected by certain atypical pathogens, such as Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

Certain patient characteristics, such as severity of renal failure or insufficiency, may influence PCT values and should be considered as potentially confounding clinical factors when interpreting PCT values.

The safety and performance of PCT-guided therapy for individuals younger than 18 years of age, pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals, or those on immunomodulatory agents, was not formally analyzed in the supportive clinical trials.

Increased PCT levels may not always be related to systemic infection. These conditions include, but are not limited to:

• Patients experiencing major trauma and/or recent surgical procedure, including extracorporeal circulation or burns;   
• Patients under treatment with OKT3 antibodies, OK-432, interleukins, TNF-alpha, and other drugs stimulating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines or resulting in anaphylaxis;   
• Patients diagnosed with active medullary C-cell carcinoma, small cell lung   
carcinoma, or bronchial carcinoid;   
• Patients with acute or chronic viral hepatitis and/or decompensated severe liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C);   
• Patients with prolonged or severe cardiogenic shock, prolonged severe organ perfusion anomalies, or after resuscitation from cardiac arrest;   
• Patients receiving peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis treatment;   
• Patients with biliary pancreatitis, chemical pneumonitis, or heat stroke;   
• Patients with invasive fungal infections (such as candidiasis and aspergillosis) or acute attacks of plasmodium falciparum malaria; and   
• Neonates during the first 2 days of life.

# 16. Test Principle

The Atellica IM BRAHMS PCT assay is a 2-site sandwich immunoassay using direct chemiluminescent technology that uses 3 mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for PCT. The first antibody, in the Lite Reagent, is a mouse monoclonal anti-PCT antibody labeled with acridinium ester. The second and third antibodies, in the ancillary reagent, are mouse monoclonal anti-PCT antibodies labeled with fluorescein. The immunocomplex formed with PCT is captured with mouse monoclonal anti-fluorescein antibody coupled to paramagnetic particles in the Solid Phase.

A direct relationship exists between the amount of PCT present in the patient sample and the amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the system.

# A. Precision

The precision of the Atellica IM B.R.A.H.M.S PCT assay precision study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3 - Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline—Third Edition. Wayne, PA: Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute; 2014.

A single site study was conducted with a panel of five (5) contrived human serum samples, calibrators, and controls were tested. The panel of human samples was prepared by spiking normal serum samples with recombinant PCT spiking material. Samples were frozen in aliquots prior to the start of the study. Each sample was assayed in two (2) replicates per run, with two (2) runs per day separated by at least 2 hours, for 20 days yielding a total of 40 runs, and 80 replicates per sample. For each analyte concentration level, the mean value with variance components (standard deviation and $\% 0 \%$ ) was determined. The following results were obtained:

A modeling analysis was conducted to estimate the $\%$ Bias, $\% 0 \%$ , and $\%$ Total Error at each medical decision point. %Bias was calculated relative to reference values derived using the slope and the intercept derived experimentally from the method comparison study between Atellica IM BRAHMS PCT and BRAHMS sensitive KRYPTOR. The $\% 0 \%$ measurement was derived using the precision profile; the $\%$ Total Error was calculated as $1 . 6 5 ^ { \star } ( \% \mathrm { C V } ) + ( \% \mathsf { B i a s } )$ . The results from each of three regressions (%Bias, $\% 0 \%$ , and %TE) are summarized in the table below.

# B. Linearity/Assay Measuring Range

Linearity of the Atellica IM B.R.A.H.M.S PCT assay was performed according to CLSI EP06-A - Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline. The study was performed using 9 samples spanning the assay range, prepared using high and low human serum pools. Testing was performed on one (1) Atellica IM Analyzer with 2 PCT reagent lots, 3 replicates per level. The mean dose value of each sample was used in data analysis. The results were analyzed by $\%$ Deviation from Linear Fit.

Regression analysis using the first, second, and third order models were conducted to assess the linearity of the assay. Regression statistics (i.e., deviation from linearity for non-linear pools) at all levels tested demonstrated a $\leq 1 0 \%$ deviation from linear fit.

Linearity was confirmed in the range of $0 . 0 3 - 6 3 . 2 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The measuring range claim for the Atellica IM BRAHMS PCT assay is $0 . 0 4 - 5 0 . 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . For PCT concentrations greater than $5 0 . 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , the measurement range can be extended up to $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ by 1:20 dilution of the sample.

# C. Dilution Recovery

To evaluate the degree of bias introduced when the instrument auto-dilution is used on samples within the assay measuring range or above.

Five (5) human serum samples spiked with recombinant PCT stock. The samples were diluted to 1:20 with Atellica IM Multi-Diluent 1 both manually and automatically onboard the system. Recoveries ranged from $96 \%$ to $102 \%$ with a mean of $9 9 \%$ .

The samples were diluted (1:20) with Atellica IM Multi-Diluent 1 using the auto-dilution protocol. Recoveries ranged from $92 \%$ to $107 \%$ .

# D. Hook Effect

A study was performed to evaluate the hook effect. In this assay, patient samples with procalcitonin concentrations as high as $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ will report $> 5 0 . 0 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# E. Detection Limits

Detection capability was determined in accordance with CLSI Document EP17‑A2. The assay is designed to have a limit of blank $( \mathsf { L o B } ) < 0 . 0 3 \ \mathsf { n g / m L }$ , a limit of detection (LoD) $< 0 . 0 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , and a limit of quantitation $( \mathsf { L o Q } ) \leq 0 . 0 6 \ \mathsf { n g / m L }$ . Representative detection capability data are presented below.

The LoB corresponds to the highest measurement result that is likely to be observed for a blank sample. The LoB of the Atellica IM BRAHMS PCT assay is $0 . 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

The LoD corresponds to the lowest concentration of procalcitonin that can be detected with a probability of $9 5 \%$ . The LoD for the Atellica IM BRAHMS PCT assay is $0 . 0 3 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ and was determined using 360 determinations, with 160 blank and 200 low-level replicates, and LoB of $0 . 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

The LoQ corresponds to the lowest amount of procalcitonin in a sample at which the within-lab CV is $\leq 2 0 \%$ . The LoQ of the Atellica IM BRAHMS PCT assay is $0 . 0 4 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , and was determined using multiple patient samples in the interval $0 . 0 1 { - } 0 . 0 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . All samples were assayed in duplicate in each of 2 runs per day using 2 reagent lots, over a period of 20 days.

# F. Endogenous Interference

Endogenous interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-A2. The assay was designed to have $\leq 1 0 \%$ interference from the following substances. Interference (bias) is the difference in the results between the control sample (does not contain the interferent) and the test sample (contains the interferent) expressed in percent. Potential interference from the following substances was tested by adding these substances to serum pools containing PCT ranging from $0 . 3 2 { - } 2 . 5 9 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

The interference with biotin was not evaluated since Atellica IM BRAHMS PCT reagents architecture does not use biotin:streptavidin. Therefore interference with biotin is not possible.

# G. Heterophile Interference

Testing was performed to determine whether the presence of HAMA (Human anti-mouse antibody) may interfere with Atellica IM BRAHMS PCT assay results.

HAMA and RF positive patient samples were divided in half and spiked with PCT to a “Level 1” $( 0 . 4 { - } 0 . 7 \ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ and a “Level $z '$ ( $1 . 5 { - } 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ concentrations. A control sample negative for HAMA and RF (“serum control” and “plasma control”) was spiked with equal amounts of PCT. Acceptance criteria were met for the HAMA spiking study. The presence of HAMA in the samples did not influence the performance of the Atellica IM BRAHMS PCT assay. No HAMA/RF interference was observed for PCT analyte with the presence of HAMA at the concentrations tested.

# H. Therapeutic Drug Interference

Therapeutic drug interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-A2. The assay was designed to have ≤ $10 \%$ interference from the following substances. Interference (bias) is the difference in the results between the control sample (does not contain the interferent) and the test sample (contains the interferent) expressed in percent. Potential interference from the following substances was tested by adding these substances to serum pools containing PCT ranging from 0.42–1.99 ng/mL. All the therapeutic drugs evaluated did not affect the test performance at concentrations evaluated.

# J. Method Comparison with Predicate Device

The method comparison study was performed according to the guidance of CLSI Guideline EP09-A3, Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples.

A total of 623 native human serum samples with assigned BRAHMS Kryptor does values $\left( 0 { - } 1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { \mathsf { n g / m L } } \right)$ were tested with the Atellica IM BRAHMS PCT assay. Samples $> 5 0 . 0 0$ $\mathsf { n g } / \mathsf { m L }$ were auto-diluted (1:20) by the Atellica IM Analyzer.

Two separate data analysis for this was performed, one with analysis of all samples with BRAHMS PCT sensitive KRYPTOR assay with sample range $0 . 0 6 { - } 4 9 . 2 0 ~ \mathrm { \ n g / m L }$ $( N = 5 2 2 )$ and one with an extended analysis including all samples tested $( N { = } 6 2 3 )$ . Weighted Deming and Passing $\&$ Bablok regression analyses including slope and intercept with $9 5 \%$ CI were calculated for $N = 5 2 2$ samples. Regression analysis comparing the Atellica IM BRAHMS PCT assay results to the predicate assay results are summarized in table below and illustrated in Figures below.

# 2. Clinical Studies

The Atellica IM BRAHMS PCT clinical performance study was conducted with banked specimens that were collected from subjects $( > 1 8$ years of age) diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock, admitted to the ICU and included as part of the intention-todiagnose population from the BRAHMS MOSES study (DEN150009).

a. Cumulative 28-day mortality in patients with Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock • ΔPCT $\leq 8 0 \%$

A decrease in the PCT levels below or equal to $80 \%$ defines a positive ΔPCT test result representing a higher risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock.

# ΔPCT $> 8 0 \%$

A decrease in the PCT levels of more than $80 \%$ defines a negative ΔPCT test result representing a lower risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock.

The combination of the first PCT level $( \leq ~ 2 . 0 ~ \mathrm { \ n g / m L }$ or > 2.0 ng/mL) at initial diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock with the patient’s clinical course and the change in PCT level over time until Day 4 provides important additional information about the mortality risk.

b. Risk Assessment for progression to Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock

PCT $>$ 2.0 ng/mL: A PCT level above $2 . 0 \ \mathrm { \ n g / m L }$ on the first day of ICU admission is associated with a high risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.   
PCT < 0.5 ng/mL: A PCT level below $0 . 5 \ \mathrm { \ n g / m L }$ on the first day of ICU admission is associated with a low risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.

PCT levels $< 0 . 5 \ \mathsf { n g / m L }$ do not exclude an infection, because localized infections (without systemic signs) may also be associated with such low levels.

The Atellica IM BRAHMS PCT assay was evaluated for the prediction of cumulative 28-day all-cause mortality in a study of 858 adult patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock recruited across 13 investigational sites in the US. The analysis population (598 subjects) comprised $44 \%$ female and $56 \%$ male patients with a mean age of 64 years. About half of the patients had severe sepsis $( 5 1 \% )$ vs. septic shock $( 4 9 \% )$ . Infections were mainly community-acquired $( 9 1 \% )$ .

The binary test result $( \Delta \mathsf { P C T } > 8 0 \%$ or $\leq 8 0 \%$ ) was significantly associated with 28‑day cumulative mortality (vital status on day 28) (Two-sided Fisher’s Exact Test $\mathsf { p }$ -value $=$ 0.009). Adjusted for ICU vs. non-ICU patient subgroups (based on hospital location at Day 4 after initial diagnosis), the association remained significant (Cochran-MantelHaenszel Test p-value $= 0 . 0 4 4$ ). In each binary ΔPCT subgroup, the 28‑day cumulative mortality rate was stratified by need to continue ICU care on Day 4 and/or the selection of Day 0 vs. Day 1 as the baseline measurement day for the ΔPCT calculation as follows:

Time-to-event analysis illustrated by the Kaplan-Meier curves above shows that patients in the ICU, or with an initial PCT value $> 2 . 0 \mathrm { \ n g / m L }$ , had a lower survival probability (higher cumulative mortality risk) from study Day 4 until the end of follow-up time (28 days) when the ΔPCT test result was positive compared to when the ΔPCT result was negative (patient subgroups according to hospital location on Day 4 and initial PCT level). A generally lower mortality rate was observed in the non-ICU subgroup.

The mortality ratios for ΔPCT positive vs. ΔPCT negative patient subgroups were:

1.92 for patients with PCT $> 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ at Day 0 receiving ICU care on Day 4   
2.11 for patients with P $\mathbf { C T } \leq 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ at Day 0 receiving ICU care on Day 4   
2.78 for patients with PCT $> 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ at Day 0 without ICU care on Day 4   
---\* for patients with $\mathsf { P C T } \leq 2 . 0 \mathsf { n g } / \mathsf { m L }$ at Day 0 without ICU care on Day 4

\*Mortality ratio cannot be calculated due to 0 fatalities in the ΔPCT negative group. Mathematically, it tends towards infinite

Based on relative mortality ratios, a decrease by more than $80 \%$ from Day 0 (or Day 1) to Day 4 constitutes a lower risk for mortality within 28 days compared to smaller declines in each subgroup. For the prediction of absolute mortality risks, ICU disposition at Day 4 and initial PCT concentrations should be considered:

An initial PCT level $\leq 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ on Day 0 followed by a PCT decline of more than $80 \%$ until Day 4 indicates an almost 2-fold lower cumulative 28-day mortality risk $( 1 2 . 8 \% )$ for patients with severe sepsis or septic shock who are still in the ICU by Day 4 compared to those patients with an initial PCT level $> 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $( 2 2 . 0 \% )$ . Regardless of the initial PCT level, patients in the ICU on Day 4 that do not decline by more than $80 \%$ in PCT plasma concentration from Day 0 to Day 4 have an even higher mortality risk of $2 3 . 2 \substack { - 3 5 . 2 \% }$ .

An initial PCT level $\mathrm { ~ > ~ } 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ that does not decline by more than $80 \%$ until Day 4 signals that such patients remain at a high mortality risk $( 1 6 . 1 \% )$ even when they are no longer receiving ICU care on Day 4. Mortality was otherwise observed between $0 . 0 { - } 8 . 1 \%$ for patients discharged from the ICU by Day 4.

Performance of ΔPCT from Day 0 to Day 4 $\leq 8 0 \%$ vs. $> 8 0 \%$ ) as a prognostic for 28-day cumulative risk of mortality was quantified by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis with a hazard ratio of 1.82 $9 5 \%$ CI: 1.14–2.89; $\mathsf { p }$ -value $= 0 . 0 1 2 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ). That is, the relative risk of cumulative 28-day mortality is about 1.8‑fold higher if an individual tests positive for ΔPCT $( \leq 8 0 \% )$ than if an individual tests negative $( > 8 0 \% )$ . As a comparison, the table below lists the univariate hazard ratios for other clinical factors evaluated as separate predictors of mortality in the study population.

ΔPCT from Day 0 (or Day 1) to Day 4 remains a prognostic parameter for the risk of cumulative 28-day mortality in patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock even when the hazard ratio is adjusted for other mortality predictors in Cox multiple regression models. The relative mortality risk estimates for ΔPCT and selected predictors are given below with $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals. For continuous predictors, the hazard ratio (HR) was calculated for 1 standard deviation (SD) change in the predictor. For binary predictors, the risk estimate compares the hazards for the 2 binary results.

a The models also included the following predictors (HR results not shown): Antibiotic Adequacy, Sepsis Severity, Biological Infection Type, Clinical Infection Type, Positive Blood Culture, PCT on Day 0, and Gender. In the analysis, missing values for predictors were multiple imputed assuming they were Missing at Random (MAR), with the multiple imputations combined according to Rubin's rules.

The change of PCT over time can also be described by the ratio of PCT values from Day 4 and Day 0 (or Day 1):

PCT ratio $=$ PCT Day 4/PCT Day 0 (or Day 1)

A decline of $\Delta \mathsf { P C T } = 8 0 \%$ translates into a PCT ratio of 0.2. The PCT ratio has values larger than 0.2 when the ΔPCT decline is $< 8 0 \%$ , which is associated with a higher risk for cumulative 28‑day all-cause mortality in patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock. Likewise, a PCT ratio $< 0 . 2$ indicates a lower risk for mortality within 28 days. On a continuous scale, the relative mortality risk for such patients is higher the larger the PCT ratio. The following table lists the hazard ratios for an increase by the factor 2 in PCT ratio (that is, the relative increase in mortality risk for a patient with any given PCT ratio compared to a patient with a 2‑fold lower PCT ratio).

For comparability, hazard ratios of the other continuous predictors were estimated for the same fractional SDs, that is, 0.54 or 0.71, respectively

Two systematic literature reviews were performed to produce both study‑ and patient‑ level meta‑analyses, which are studies that combine and contrast data from multiple sources to identify patterns among study results (FDA public docket FDA-2016-N-2880).

The study‑level meta‑analysis used aggregate descriptive information extracted from publications, and the patient‑level meta‑analysis used aggregate patient‑level data from the raw dataset of each study. Each meta‑analysis used random‑effects models and calculated point estimates, differences, odds ratios (OR), interquartile ranges (IQRs), and $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals as appropriate. The endpoints evaluated were: proportion of subjects initiating antibiotics, duration of antibiotic therapy, exposure to antibiotics, length of hospital stay, mortality, and complications (patient‑level only).

The study‑level meta‑analysis encompassed 11 randomized control trials (RCTs), which were published between 2004–2016, and included 4090 patients.

# Decision-Making on Antibiotic Discontinuation for Suspected or Confirmed Septic Patients

Two systematic literature reviews were performed along with study‑ and patient‑level meta‑analyses, which are studies that combine and contrast data from multiple sources to identify patterns among study results. The study‑level meta‑analysis used aggregate descriptive information extracted from publications, and the patient‑level meta‑analysis used aggregate patient‑level data from the raw dataset of each study. Each meta‑ analysis used random‑effects models and calculated point estimates, differences, odds ratios (OR), interquartile ranges (IQRs), and $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals as appropriate (see tables below). The endpoints evaluated were: duration of antibiotic therapy (study‑ level only), exposure to antibiotics (patient‑level only), length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay (patient‑level only), and mortality.

The study‑level meta‑analysis encompassed 10 RCTs, which were published between 2008-2016 and included 3489 patients. (See FDA public docket FDA-2016-N-2880).

The above patient‑level meta‑analysis encompassed 5 RCTs, which were published between 2008-2010 and included 598 patients as listed below.

a Number of patients. b Patients that did not classify as sepsis were removed prior to analysis (185 for PCT group and 164 for control group), leaving 598 patients.

Using this subset of meta‑analyses, it was concluded that PCT‑guided antibiotic therapy resulted in:

1.5-day reduction in antibiotic duration.   
3.2-day reduction in total antibiotic exposure.   
$23 \%$ reduction in overall antibiotic exposure (that is, total days of antibiotic therapy) for patients who presented to the emergency department and other associated clinics, but were not admitted.   
No negative effects in regards to mortality, hospital length of stay, or ICU length of stay.

# Recommendations for Laboratory Reports for Initiation and Discontinuation:

The Change in Procalcitonin Calculator is available at www.BRAHMS-PCTCalculator.com.

It is suggested to report the absolute PCT values (single or serial). For serial PCT values, the report should also indicate if the ΔPCT $( \% )$ was ≤ $80 \%$ or $> 8 0 \%$ . The laboratory report should include a reference or a link to the Atellica IM BRAHMS PCT package insert for a guided interpretation of the test results.

# 3. Traceability and Value Assignment

The Atellica IM BRAHMS PCT assay is standardized using a reference preparation antigen as master standard. Assay standardization is verified through regression analysis of a PCT-positive patient population. Assigned values for calibrators and controls are traceable to this standardization.

# 4. Stability

# Reagent Stability – Shelf-life

To establish the shelf-life claims for the Atellica IM BRAHMS PCT reagents and Calibrator (kit), the reagents and calibrators stored at ${ 2 / 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } }$ and were tested with various samples at multiple time points. Sets of calibrators were also stored at or below $\scriptscriptstyle - 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ and were tested at the same time points.

Testing demonstrated that the Atellica IM BRAHMS PCT reagents are stable up to 12 months when properly stored at ${ 2 / 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } }$ . Unopened Atellica IM BRAHMS PCT reagents and calibrators are stable at ${ 2 / 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } }$ until expiration date printed on the product packaging.

Reagent Stability – On-Board

The onboard stability of the Atellica IM BRAHMS PCT reagents is 60 days onboard, pack calibration interval of 35 days, and lot calibration interval of 82 days.

# Calibrator Stability– Shelf-life

Testing demonstrated that the Atellica IM BRAHMS PCT reagents are stable up to 12 months when properly stored at ${ 2 / 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } }$ . Lyophilized calibrators are stable until the expiration date on the product when stored at $_ { 2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } }$ .

Calibrator Stability– Reconstituted In use $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } / \mathsf { O } \mathsf { B } \mathsf { S } )$

Reconstituted calibrators are stable for 24 hours at $_ { 2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } }$ or for 8 hours at room temperature (package insert claims).

Specimen Stability a. Room temperature

Studies demonstrated that serum samples specimens are stable for 8 hours at room temperature.

b. Refrigerated $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$

Studies demonstrated that serum samples are stable for 24 hours at $2 . 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$

c. Freeze/Thaw cycles $( \leq - 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$

The recommended specimen handling are provided below.

• Do not use samples that have been stored at room temperature for longer than 8 hours.   
• Tightly cap and refrigerate specimens at $_ { 2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } }$ if the assay is not completed within 8 hours.   
• Freeze samples at $\leq - 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ if the sample is not assayed within 48 hours.   
• Freeze samples up to 5 times, and mix thoroughly after thawing.

Additional sample stability studies were performed on the MOSES clinical samples as described in DEN150009.
