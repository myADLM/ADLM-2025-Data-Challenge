# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The Solana Bordetella Complete Assay is an in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis nucleic acids isolated from nasopharyngeal swab specimens obtained from patients suspected of having respiratory tract infection attributable to Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis.

The Solana Bordetella Complete Assay is an HDA-based duplex assay that targets the IS481 and IS1001 sequence of Bordetella pertussis (BP) and Bordetella parapertussis (BPP) genomes, respectively. The IS481 sequence may also be found in strains of other organisms (i.e., B. holmesii and B. bronchiseptica). The IS1001 sequence may also be found in strains of other organisms (i.e., B. bronchiseptica). B. holmesii infection may cause clinical illness similar to $B$ . pertussis, and mixed outbreaks involving both $B$ . pertussis and B. holmesii infection have been reported. Additional testing should be performed if necessary to differentiate B. holmesii and B. pertussis. B. bronchiseptica is a rare cause of infection in humans. When clinical factors suggest that $B _ { \cdot }$ . pertussis or $B$ . parapertussis may not be the cause of respiratory infection, other clinically appropriate investigation(s) should be carried out in accordance with published guidelines.

Negative results for the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay do not preclude $B _ { \cdot }$ . pertussis or $B$ . parapertussis infection and positive results do not rule out co-infection with other respiratory pathogens. Results from the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay should be used in conjunction with information obtained during the patient's clinical evaluation as an aid in diagnosis of $B$ . pertussis and or $B$ . parapertussis infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.

2. Indication(s) for use: Same as intended use.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

For in vitro diagnostic use only For prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements: Solana Instrument

# I. Device Description:

The Solana Bordetella Complete Assay amplifies, detects and differentiates DNA of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis from nasopharyngeal swabs.

The assay consists of two major steps: 1) specimen preparation, and 2) amplification and detection of target sequences specific to $B$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis using isothermal Helicase-Dependent Amplification (HDA) in the presence of target-specific fluorescence probes.

A patient nasopharyngeal swab specimen in transport media is transferred to a Process Buffer Tube, subjected to heat treatment at $9 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 5 minutes and mixed. The processed sample is transferred to a Reaction Tube. The Reaction Tube contains lyophilized HDA reagents, dNTPs, primers and probes. Once rehydrated with the processed sample, the Reaction Tube is placed in Solana for amplification and detection of $B$ . pertussis and $B .$ . parapertussis-specific target sequences. In Solana, the target sequences are amplified by $B$ . pertussis and $B _ { \cdot }$ . parapertussis specific primers and detected by $B .$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis-specific fluorescence probes, respectively. A process control (PRC) is included in the Process Buffer Tube to monitor sample processing, inhibitory substances in clinical samples, reagent failure or device failure. The PRC target is amplified by specific primers and detected by a PRC specific fluorescence probe.

The two target probes and PRC probe are labeled with a quencher on one end and a fluorophore on the other end. In addition, the two target probes and PRC probe have one or more bases that are comprised of ribonucleic acid. Upon annealing to $B$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis or PRC amplicons, the fluorescence probes are cleaved by RNaseH2 and the fluorescence signal increases due to physical separation of fluorophore from quencher. Solana measures and interprets the fluorescent signal, using on-board method-specific algorithms. Solana then reports the test results to the user on its display screen, and it can print out the results via an attached printer.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility

A repeatability study was conducted using a panel of 30 contrived samples with two (2) subsets of 15 samples, where operator 1 tested samples 1-15 and operator 2 tested samples 16-30. Each subset was manufactured as negative samples $\mathrm { ( n } { = } 3 \mathrm { ) }$ ), high negative samples containing BP and BPP $\scriptstyle ( 1 = 3$ ; $\mathrm { C } _ { 2 0 } - \mathrm { C } _ { 8 0 }$ concentration per target), low positive samples containing BP or BPP $\mathrm { n } { = } 3$ ; near the assay limit of detection), and moderate positive samples containing BP and BPP $\mathrm { \Pi } _ { \mathrm { n } } { = } 3$ ; 2x LoD per target) (see Table below). The positive samples were generated from two (2) separate strains each of BP and BPP in equal proportions. The samples were randomized and blind-coded within each panel, and each operator tested one (1)

panel subset, along with three (3) positive and three (3) negative external controls, in two (2) runs.

Panels and controls were tested at one (1) site by two (2) operators per instrument for fifteen (15) days, each sample tested in three (3) replicates, for a total of 45 results per level for each organism strain (2 operators $\mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 5$ days x 3 replicates).

A multi-center reproducibility study was conducted using two different four-sample panel sets each consisting of three levels of combined $B$ . pertussis (BP) and $B$ . parapertussis (BPP) (two (2) strains of each organism) contrived samples and a negative contrived sample. Set 1 consisted of BP A639 and BPP A747, Set 2 consisted of BP E431 and BPP E838. Samples were diluted in negative nasal matrix (UTM) to $2 \mathbf { x }$ LoD for moderate positive, 1x LoD for low positive and diluted to concentrations below the LoD (i.e., $\mathrm { C } _ { 2 0 }$ to $\mathrm { C } _ { 8 0 }$ ) for high negative samples. Negative nasal matrix without spiked organism was used for the negative sample. Positive and negative controls were run in triplicate along with the panels.

Panels and controls were tested over five days at three testing sites by two (2) operators per instrument for five (5) days with each sample tested in three (3) replicates, for a total of 45 results per level for each organism strain (2 operators x 5 days $_ { \textrm { X 3 } }$ sites $_ { \textrm { X 3 } }$ replicates).

Specimen Stability

Contrived BP and BPP positive specimens were prepared by diluting BP or BPP cells to the 2x LOD concentration of each target in $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of negative matrix for each of the eight transport media types that are claimed for use with the Solana Bordetella Assay: Molecular Grade Water, Saline $( 0 . 9 \% )$ , Tris-EDTA, Amies Liquid transport media (or Eswab), M4, M4-RT, M5, and UTM were tested with one validation lot of reagents and the Solana Bordetella assay workflow.

The specimens were stored at three different storage conditions—≤ $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , $2 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ , $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Testing indicated that specimens can be stored before processing at $2 ^ { \circ }$ to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for up to 97 hours, up to 49 hours at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , or up to 5-months at $\le - 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

No significant difference in assay performance was seen between the four different types of viral transport media, saline $( 0 . 8 5 \% )$ , Tris EDTA, Molecular Grade Water, or Amies.

# Processed Specimen Stability

Contrived samples were prepared in negative nasal matrix with organism concetnrations of $2 \mathbf { x }$ LOD for BP (Strain A639, 2050 CFU/mL) and $2 \mathbf { x }$ LOD for BPP (Strain E838, 11066 CFU/mL). The stability of samples in Process Buffer at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ before and after heat lysis was evaluated in this study. Three (3) replicates were processed and tested before heat lysis and after heat lysis conditions according to the instructions for use. The condition, before or after heating, and testing time points for the corresponding samples in Process Buffer kept at the evaluated temperatures are listed in Table 6 below.

Results from the study demonstrated that BP- and BPP-positive samples in Process Buffer generated the expected positive results after storage at at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for 97 hours and at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 49 hours both before and after undergoing heat lysis.

# Controls

Process Control

The process control is used to monitor sample processing, to detect HDA inhibitory specimens, to confirm the integrity of assay reagents and the operation of the Solana instrument. The process control is included in the Process Buffer tube used for each specimen.

External Controls

Controls (Quidel Molecular Bordetella Control Set, which contains positive and negative controls and serves as an external processing control) were run on the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay each day of testing during the clinical study. A total of 117 positive controls (BP-positive and BPP-positive) and 117 negative controls (BP- and BPP-negative) were evaluated across five (5) clinical test sites.

All controls produced the expected results.

These controls are described as follows:

The Quidel Molecular Bordetella external positive control may be treated as a patient specimen. The control should be sampled and tested as if it were a patient specimen and processed as described above in the Assay Procedure. The external positive control is intended to monitor substantial reagent and instrument failure. · The Quidel Molecular Bordetella external negative control may be treated as a patient specimen. The control should be sampled and tested as if it were a patient specimen and processed as described above in the Assay Procedure. The external negative control is used to detect reagent or environmental contamination (or carry-over) by $B .$ . pertussis and $B$ . parapertussis DNA or amplicon.

It is recommended that the reactivity of each new lot and each new shipment of the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay be verified on receipt and before use using the Quidel Molecular Bordetella Control Set External control tests should be performed thereafter in accordance with appropriate federal, state and local guidelines. The Solana Bordetella Complete Assay should not be used in patient testing if the external controls do not produce the correct results.

# d. Limit of Detection

The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection or LoD) of the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay was determined using quantified (CFU/mL) cultures of two (2) BP strains (A639 and E431) and two (2) BPP strains (A747 and E838) serially diluted in a negative nasal matrix. Results are presented in Table 7.

# e. Inclusivity

The reactivity of the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay was evaluated against an additional eight (8) Bordetella pertussis (BP) and eight (8) Bordetella parapertussis (BPP) strains that were not used for LOD determination. The testing was performed at 1x LOD (1025 CFU/mL and $5 5 3 3 \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ , respectively) level of the assay. All additional sixteen (16) strains were detected in the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay (Table 8).

To supplement inclusivity testing for each Solana Bordetella Complete assay target, in-silico analysis was performed as an additional evaluation of Solana Bordetella BP and BPP amplicon sequence for the predicted detection of microorganism strains.

# f. Analytical Specificity:

Cross-Reactivity

Based on in-silico analysis, $B .$ . holmesii and B. bronchiseptica genomes are expected to share complete or nearly complete sequence identity with the BP amplicon because both contain the IS481 sequence. Therefore, these organisms are expected to crossreact with the Solana Bordetella Assay. Other microorganisms are not expected to cause cross-reactivity because their sequence alignment with the BP amplicon shows multiple mismatches in the primer and probe binding regions. It is also be noted that no Bordetella parapertussis sequences were retrieved from the blastn search, suggesting that there is little to no sequence identity shared between $B$ . parapertussis and the BP amplicon. Therefore, the BP primers are not expected to amplify any BPP sequences.

Furthermore, based on in-silico analysis, the B. bronchiseptica genome is expected to share complete or nearly complete sequence identity with the BPP amplicon because it contains the IS1001 sequence. Therefore, it is expected to cross-react with the Solana Bordetella Assay. Other microorganisms are not expected to cause crossreactivity because their sequence alignment with the BPP amplicon shows multiple mismatches in the primer and probe binding regions, which are not likely to promote BPP primer or probe binding. It is also be noted that no Bordetella pertussis sequences were retrieved from the blastn search, suggesting that there is little to no sequence identity shared between BP and the BPP amplicon. Therefore, the BPP primers are not expected to amplify any BP sequences.

A study was performed to determine if eighty-three (83) microorganisms or viruses likely to be present in nasopharyngeal swabs cross-react with the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay. The microorganisms (Table 9, 10, 11) were tested above clinically relevant levels (bacteria/yeast $\geq 1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ CFU/mL, viruses $\mathrm { 1 x 1 0 ^ { 5 } T C I D 5 0 / m L } \mathrm { \Omega }$ ).

Five (5) non-BP organism strains tested positive for BP for all three (3) replicates. The five organisms include 4 of 4 Bordetella holmesii strains (ZeptoMetrix F061, ATCC 51541, ATCC 700053, and ATCC 700052) and 1 of 8 Bordetella bronchiseptica strains (ATCC 4617). Cross-reactivity with these organisms is expected due to the presence of the BP target sequence, IS481, in the genomes of these organisms.

None of the potentially cross-reactive organisms tested positive for BPP.

High levels of BP did not generate any BPP-positive results, and high levels of BPP did not generate any BP-positive results demonstrating no cross-reactivity between the two organism targets.

# Microbial Interference

A study was performed to determine if eighty-three (83) microorganisms or viruses likely to be present in nasopharyngeal specimens interfere with detection of the Bordetella pertussis (BP) or Bordetella parapertussis (BPP) with the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay. Samples were prepared with one BP strain (A639) and one BPP strain (E838) at 2x LoD $( 2 0 5 0 \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ and $1 1 0 6 6 \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ , respectively) combined with each potentially interfering microorganism. The potentially interfering microorganisms (Table 9, 10, 11) were tested above clinically relevant levels (bacteria/yeast $\geq 1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ CFU/mL, viruses $1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ TCID50/mL).

None (0) of the organisms or viruses tested above interfered with the performance of the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay for detection of BP or BPP.

High levels of BP A639 did not cause interference with BPP E838 detection, and high levels of BPP E838 did not cause interference with BP A639 detection.

# Interfering Substances

The performance of Solana Bordetella Complete Assay was evaluated with sixteen (16) potentially interfering substances that may be present in nasopharygeal specimens collected to test for Bordetella pertussis (BP) and Bordetella parapertussis (BPP) infection. The substances listed in Table 12 were diluted in negative nasal matrix and tested in the absence or presence of $2 \mathbf { x }$ LOD BP (Strain A639 2050 CFU/mL) and $2 \mathbf { x }$ LOD BPP (Strain E838 11066 CFU/mL) in the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay.

Negative sample testing in the presence of each of the sixteen (16) substances produced negative results for 3 of 3 replicates. $\mathrm { B P + B P P }$ sample testing at $2 \mathbf { x }$ LoD levels in the presence of each of the 16 substances produced BP and BPP positive results for 3 of 3 replicates. Based on these results, the 16 substances tested in this study are considered to not interfere with the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay.

# g. Carry-over/Cross-contamination

A study was conducted to evaluated the potential for carry-over or cross-contamination for the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay. For the study two (2) samples were prepared: a Bordetella pertussis (BP) positive sample and a BP negative sample. The positive sample was prepared by adding cells of one BP strain with a known titer to negative nasal matrix at the concentration of $\mathrm { { 1 . 0 \ x 1 0 ^ { 6 } C F U / m L } }$ . The negative nasal matrix served as the BP negative sample. In each experiment, the positive samples were alternated with the negative samples and tested using Solana Bordetella Complete Assay to assess the risk of cross contamination. In total, two (2) operators tested a total of 30 positive and 30

negative samples over a total of five (5) runs. All positive BP samples tested positive and all negative BP samples tested negative. No evidence of carry-over/cross contamination was observed with the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay when performed in accordance with the package insert.

h. Fresh versus frozen study

A study was performed to demonstrate equivalency between fresh and frozen specimens. Two (2) BP strains (A639 394 and E431) and two (2) BPP strains (A747 and E838) were serially diluted in a negative nasal matrix at varying concentrations above and below the assay LOD. The dilutions were tested fresh and then after freezing at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . The dilutions demonstrating at least $9 5 \%$ detection $( \geq 1 9$ of 20) were thawed and re-tested. For all four (4) organism strains tested, the fresh and frozen results matched at LOD concentrations indicating equivalence between fresh and frozen samples when tested with the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay.

# i. Assay cut-off:

The preliminary baseline, cut-off, and threshold settings were determined for the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay on the Solana instrument during development. The settings were based on the analysis of negative clinical specimens (these specimens were not part of the clinical study), as well as analysis of contrived specimens for the Limit of Detection Study. The baseline, threshold, and cut-off settings were established and used during the clinical trial.

Testing with contiguous fresh nasopharyngeal swabs on the Solana device was performed at four (4) laboratories. Specimens were eluted into the following sample buffers during the clinical studies: Remel M6 $\mathtt { ( n { = } 2 } 3 6$ or $3 1 . 8 \%$ ), UTM $( \mathrm { n } \mathrm { = } 2 2 6$ or $3 0 . 5 \%$ ), Tris EDTA $\mathrm { \Delta } ( { \mathrm { n } } { = } 1 7 5$ or $2 3 . 6 \%$ ), and Molecular Grade Water $\scriptstyle ( \mathtt { n } = 1 0 4$ or $1 4 . 0 \%$ ). An aliquot from each buffer was frozen and shipped on dry ice to the central laboratory for testing with comparator reference assays.

Clinical performance was based on comparison of the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay results to those obtained by a composite reference method that included two (2) manufacturer validated, IS481-targeted real-time PCR assays and bi-directional sequencing. The PCR assay protocols included 37 amplification cycles.

# a. Prospective clinical study

Seven hundred forty-one (741) fresh nasopharyngeal swab specimens, obtained from female and male patients suspected of having respiratory tract infection attributable to Bordetella pertussis or Bordetella parapertussis, were prospectively collected and transported to each laboratory for testing with the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay. Four (4) specimens $( 0 . 5 \% )$ were invalid (in both the initial and repeat test) and have been removed from further analysis. The tables below present the data for the remaining seven hundred thirty-seven (737) specimens.

# b. Retrospective Clinical Study, Archived Specimens

Two hundred thirty-three (233) selected frozen archival specimens were collected at four (4) sites. The frozen archival nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained from female and male patients previously tested for the presence of Bordetella pertussis or Bordetella parapertussis. The specimens were tested with the Solana Bordetella Complete Assay and the Composite Reference Method. Archival specimens were eluted into the following sample buffers: Amies (eSwab) $\scriptstyle ( 1 = 1 7$ or $7 . 3 \%$ , UTM $[ \mathrm { n } { = } 1 0 2$ or $4 3 . 8 \%$ ), Remel M6 $\scriptstyle \mathtt { n } = 4 8$ or $2 0 . 6 \%$ , $0 . 8 5 \%$ Saline $\mathrm { \Delta } \cdot \mathrm { \sim } 1 0$ or $4 . 3 \%$ ) and Molecular Grade Water $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { n } { = } 5 6$ or $2 4 . 0 \%$ ). An aliquot from each specimen was re-frozen and shipped on dry ice to the central laboratory for testing with comparator assays. The testing with the comparator assays was performed concurrently and in a blinded fashion. The tables below present the data for the specimens.
