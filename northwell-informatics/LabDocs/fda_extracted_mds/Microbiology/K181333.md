# Sample matrix

This study was performed on one ADVIA Centaur XP instrument, using 68 sets of matched samples of different matrixes (serum, serum separator tube (SST), EDTA plasma and lithium heparin plasma) from commercial sources

The samples were analyzed in duplicate in randomized order using one reagent lot.

Comparing Serum Separator Tube (y) vs Serum $( \times )$ : (Deming regression) $\mathsf { y } = - 0 . 0 1 +$ $0 . 9 9 \times ,$ $\mathsf { r } { = } 0 . 9 9 6$ , sample range for both matrixes 0.10-19.15 Index Value and 0.10- 19.59 Index Value respectively. Note – correlation coefficient is calculated using linear regression.   
• Comparing EDTA Plasma(y) vs Serum (x): (Deming regression) $\forall = - 0 . 0 2 \ : + \ : 0 . 9 6 \ : \times ,$ $\mathsf { r } { = } 0 . 9 9 8$ , sample range for both matrixes 0.10-19.14 Index Value and 0.11-19.19 Index Value respectively. Note – correlation coefficient is calculated using linear regression.   
• Comparing Lithium Heparin Plasma(y) vs Serum (x): (Deming regression) $\mathsf { y } = - 0 . 0 2 \cdot +$ $0 . 9 6 \times ,$ $\mathsf { r } { = } 0 . 9 9 8$ , sample range for both matrixes 0.10-19.15 Index Value and 0.10- 18.73 Index Value respectively. Note – correlation coefficient is calculated using linear regression.

The results supports that Serum Separator Tube is equivalent matrix to Serum, EDTA Plasma is equivalent matrix to Serum and Lithium Heparin Plasma is an equivalent matrix to Serum.

# Clinical study

A multisite clinical study to compare the reference with ADVIA Centaur Herpes-1 IgG was performed. Sensitivity and specificity were determined by comparing the performance of the ADVIA Centaur HSV1 assay to a commercially available anti-HSV-1 IgG immunoblot method (Comparative Assay) and a validated Western Blot reference confirmatory test (University of Washington, Seattle).A total of 864 specimens $( \ge 1 8$ years of age), including specimens from 274 pregnant women, were collected within the United States and tested at 3 independent external laboratories. Samples were analyzed in singlicate.

Of these specimens, 520 were reactive, and 344 were nonreactive with the ADVIA Centaur HSV1 assay. The overall agreement was $9 7 . 0 \%$ (838/864) with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval (CI) of $9 5 . 6 \% - 9 7 . 9 \%$ .

Of the 864 specimens tested by the Comparative Assay, 22 were equivocal and further tested by the Western Blot test. After Western Blot testing, 19 of the specimens were resolved to be negative and 3 remained equivocal.

The results obtained for the intended use population are presented below
