# I. Device Description:

The H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test utilizes antibodies specific for $H .$ pylori antigen in human fecal samples. The Membrane Device contains a “Reaction Window” with two vertical lines of immobilized antibodies. The test line (“T”) contains antibodies specific for $H .$ pylori antigen. The control line (“C”) contains antibodies to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The “Conjugate” consists of antibodies to $H .$ . pylori antigen coupled to horseradish peroxidase. After incubation, the Reaction Window is examined visually for the appearance of vertical blue lines on the “C” and “T” sides of the Reaction Window. A blue line on the “T” side of the Reaction Window indicates a positive result. A positive “C” reaction, indicated by a vertical blue line on the “C” side of the Reaction Window, confirms that the sample and reagents were added correctly, the reagents were active at the time of performing the assay, and that the sample migrated properly through the Membrane Device. It also confirms the reactivity of the other reagents associated with the assay.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The reproducibility of the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test was determined using an eight member masked fecal specimen panel. The panel consisted of 2 negative, 2 high negative (just below C5), 2 low positive (just above LoD), and 2 moderate positive (3-4x higher than the C95) specimens. Each fecal specimen was spiked using a known concentration of $H .$ . pylori purified flagellar antigen from whole organism to achieve the desired concentration. Testing was performed at 2 independent laboratories and on-site at TECHLAB, Inc. The Specimens were tested twice a day in triplicate over a five day period by multiple technicians at each site using two different kit lots. Positive and negative controls were run with each sample panel of masked specimens. The result from each laboratory were submitted to TECHLAB Inc. and compared. The results for the positive control, negative control, true negative, low positive, and moderate positive, was consistent among all three locations with $100 \%$ reproducibility for all test panels. The high negative provided a positive result 63 out of 180 observations.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable.   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Sample stability study:

The effect of specimen storage on antigen stability was evaluated for both fresh stool samples and stool samples in transport media. The following transport media were used for the study: Thermo Scientific Protocol Cary Blair media and Thermo Scientific Protocol C&S media. For the analysis, a total of 32 fecal specimens were tested with the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test. The samples were prepared using a negative fecal matrix and spiked with $H .$ pylori antigen (ATCC strain 43526). The panel consisted of 2 negative, 5 high negative $\left( \mathbf { C } _ { 5 } \right)$ , 10 low positive $\left( 1 { - } 2 \mathrm { x } \mathrm { C } _ { 9 5 } \right)$ , and 15 positive specimens covering the range of the test (For fresh and preserved specimens this range was $5 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } - 1 2 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ .

Fresh samples were stored at refrigerated temperatures (between $2 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C }$ and $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and room temperatures (between $2 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and $2 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ ) and were tested at 0, 24, 48,72 and 96 hours. Positive and negative controls were also tested at each timepoint.

Fecal specimens added to Cary Blair and C&S media were transported as recommended in their respective package inserts; samples were stored at refrigerated temperatures (between $2 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ and $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and room temperatures (between $2 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and $2 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ ) and were tested at 24 hour intervals from 0 to 96 hours.

For fresh samples stored at refrigerated and room temperatures, the positive and negative samples gave the expected results $100 \%$ of the time. Storage in Cary Blair and C&S transport media did not affect the stability of the samples. Based on these results, the recommended storage time for fresh, Cary Blair, and C&S stored samples is up to 96 hours when stored between $2 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ and $8 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ and between $2 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

# Frozen sample stability study:

Stability of frozen fecal matrix samples compared to fresh samples was established using the 32 masked fecal specimen panel prepared as described for the storage stability study. Samples were not diluted into transport media for this study. Samples were stored at $\leq - 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or $\le - 7 0 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { C }$ for 14 days. Specimens were tested at 0, 5, 10, and 14 days. The results showed that all positive samples remained positive and negative samples remained negative throughout the study.

# Freeze/Thaw study:

A study was conducted to determine stability after 3 freeze/thaw cycles using the 32- masked fecal specimen panel described for the storage stability study. Samples were not diluted into transport media for this study. The results showed that up to 3 freeze/thaw cycles neither enhanced nor impaired the performance of the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test. Therefore, the package insert will indicate that if samples are not tested fresh, frozen stool samples may be tested and may undergo up to no more than 2 freeze/thaw cycles.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of detection (LoD) for the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test was determined by spiking purified flagellar antigen into unpreserved (raw stool) and preserved (Cary Blair and C&S media) stool samples. The concentrations are reported in $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ and by factoring in the dilutions and the final volume used in the assay. The LoD is the concentrations of the antigen that yields a positive result $9 5 \%$ of the time and a negative result $5 \%$ of the time. Table 1 lists the LoD values for antigen spiked in negative fecal matrix, Cary Blair, and C&S transport media.

# g. Prozone/Hook Effect:

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that a high concentration of H. pylori (antigen) does not interfere with a positive reaction in the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test. High concentration samples were prepared by spiking negative fecal matrix with H. pylori antigen at $1 2 \mathrm { u g / m L }$ (i.e. $1 0 \mathrm { x }$ the highest concentration observed in a positive clinical sample). A total of 5 different dilutions were prepared from the contrived sample. Samples were prepared by spiking the following concentrations of antigen into a negative fecal pool: $1 2 \mathrm { u g / m L }$ , $6 \mathrm { u g / m L }$ , $2 . 4 ~ \mathrm { u g / m L }$ , $1 . 2 \mathrm { u g / m L }$ , 0.6 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ and $0 . 1 2 \mathrm { u g / m L }$ . Testing was performed in triplicate according to the Package Insert instructions. The results demonstrated that elevated levels of antigen did not affect the test results.

# Prospective study

# Initial Diagnosis

The performance of the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test was evaluated by conducting a multi-site prospective clinical study. Six independent sites were included, five of which collected specimens from patients suspected of $H .$ . pylori infection. The sixth site, TECHLAB, did not conduct specimen collection. Of these five collection sites, three conducted testing using both the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test and the composite reference method (CRM). The remaining two sites performed CRM testing and sent samples to TECHLAB for testing using the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test. The CRM for diagnosis of $H .$ pylori infection is based on endoscopy obtained gastric biopsy. The biopsied tissue was tested for the presence of $H .$ . pylori by histology, or rapid urease test. The sensitivity and specificity for the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test was determined using the CRM.

Prospective testing consisted of 205 stool specimens collected from the patients with symptoms of dyspepsia, gastritis, or peptic ulcer who were scheduled to undergo endoscopy with gastric biopsy as part of routine care (Initial Diagnosis Group). Of these, 83 patients were excluded either because they were on a treatment regimen [i.e., proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), or antibiotics] or had samples with CRM results that were rapid urease positive but histology negative. The remaining 122 patients who were not taking PPIs or antibiotics at the time of specimen collection were considered for final analysis. These specimens were tested at the following five sites: Carilion Clinic, International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research Bangladesh, Mayo Clinic, University of Virginia, Kliniken Essen-Mitte, and TECHLAB (internal).

The ages of patients ranged from less than 19 years to 82 years with $100 \%$ of the specimens coming from patients were $\geq 1 8$ years. Of the 122 patients tested $64 \%$ were female and $34 \%$ were male. No difference in test performance was observed based on patient age or gender. The results are provided in Table 3 which shows the clinical performance of the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test for all 6 test sites combined. The results of the study show that the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test exhibited a sensitivity of $9 7 . 0 \%$ , and a specificity of $100 \%$ compared to the CRM.

\*Additional testing with an FDA cleared H. pylori stool antigen test provided an antigen negative result.

# Post Therapy Diagnosis

Eradication (post-therapy) evaluation was conducted on patients enrolled prospectively at 3 sites. A total of 9 specimens were collected at least 4 weeks after completion of the treatment regimen. Post therapy evaluation was conducted using a two-step algorithm of patient analysis. First, patients were screened for the continued presence of H. pylori using an FDA-cleared stool antigen test. Positive patients were reflexed to a follow-up endoscopy and biopsy analysis by rapid urease test and histology. The results are provided in Table 4 which shows the clinical performance of the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test for all 6 test sites combined. The results of the study show that the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test exhibited a sensitivity of $1 0 0 . 0 \%$ compared to the CRM.

The ages of patients ranged from 33 years to $7 2 \mathrm { ~ Y ~ }$ ears. Of the 9 patients tested, 6

were female and 3 were male.

# Retrospective study

A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate performance and to augment the prospective clinical study. Testing of retrospective samples was conducted at TECHLAB.

To provide assurance that the retrospective samples are representative of wide range of OD readings, CRM positives samples and retrospective positive samples were both tested by an FDA cleared ELISA. The distribution and mean OD values obtained from the retrospective study, ${ \bf n } = 2 0 0$ samples, were compared to those values obtained from CRM positive samples, $\mathrm { n } = 4 6$ , to ensure that the use of retrospective sample results reflects the OD distribution of CRM positive samples. This analysis demonstrated that the use of retrospective and prospective clinical samples has similar distributions and no concern of bias was noted.

The performance of the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test was evaluated by testing retrospective samples at TECHLAB. Retrospective testing consisted of 200 frozen stool specimens (94 positive and 106 negative by an FDA Cleared ELISA) obtained from sample repositories. Positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) for the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test was determined by comparing to an FDA Cleared ELISA that was tested concurrently. The results of the study show that the H. PYLORI QUIK CHEK test exhibited a PPA of $9 8 . 9 \%$ and a NPA of $9 7 . 2 \%$ with an FDA Cleared ELISA. The results are shown in Table 5.
