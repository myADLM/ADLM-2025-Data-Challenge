The Accula RSV assay is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of RSV infection in children and adults in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors.

Negative results do not preclude RSV virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.

2. Indication(s) for use: Same as Intended Use.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For Prescription Use

4. Special instrument requirements: To be used only with the Accula Dock Instrument

# I. Device Description:

The Accula RSV Test is a semi-automated, colorimetric, multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nucleic acid amplification test to qualitatively detect RSV A and RSV B viral RNA from unprocessed nasal swabs that have not undergone prior nucleic acid extraction. The system integrates nucleic acid extraction, reverse transcription, nucleic acid amplification using a novel Mesa Biotech technology, and hybridization-based visual detection into a completely self-contained and semi-automated system. The Accula RSV system consists of a small reusable Dock to drive the automated testing process and a single-use disposable test cassette that contains all the reagents.

Upon insertion of a Test Cassette, the Dock will detect and identify the cassette type. After the user transfers a clinical sample into the cassette and closes the dock lid, the embedded firmware will control fluid flow of the sample into the various chambers of the cassette.

Amplicon detection requires the hybridization of two internal probes to generate a signal on the Accula RSV detection strip. Dyed polystyrene microspheres are conjugated to oligonucleotide probes to form an amplicon-microsphere complex by hybridization to an internal region of the amplicon. The complex migrates through the pores of the detection strip membrane and across capture zones which contain oligonucleotides complementary to an amplicon region distinct from the detection probe binding site. Hybridization of the amplicon-microsphere complex to a capture zone probe retards the flow of the specific amplicon. This allows for the generation of a visible signal in the form of a colored line at the capture zone.

# Interpretation of results:

Results are interpreted visually by the operator after the test has completed. A colored line of any intensity at the “RSV” location indicates a positive result if the test is valid. A Negative Control line at the end of the test strip controls for non-specific binding or amplification and must be absent for a valid test. A positive control line at the beginning of the strip tests for amplification effectiveness and is necessary to interpret a test as “negative” for RSV.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The reproducibility of the Accula RSV Test was tested in a study using contrived nasal swabs at three CLIA-waived sites (sites 1 through 3) and one moderately complex site (site 4) based in the United States. The objective of this study was to test panels of contrived nasal swab samples with the Accula RSV Test to demonstrate reproducibility of the assay in the hands of multiple users at multiple sites over multiple non-consecutive days.

Samples were provided to testing operators in panels of 3 samples (RSV Low Positive, Moderate Positive, and Negative). The targeted concentrations for the Moderate Positive samples were approximately 3X the respective limit of detection (LoD), the targeted concentrations for the Low Positive samples were approximately 1X the respective LoD, and the Negative samples contained no RSV. Samples were blinded and randomized. Each operator tested one panel per day, testing a maximum of three samples at a time. Each sample was tested in triplicate (from separate swabs) (2 operators x 1 run x 3 swabs x 5 non-consecutive days $= 3 0$ observations for each site per sample type). Results are reported for counts and percent agreement with expected results. Reproducibility was evaluated by site, by operator and by day.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not Applicable; this is a qualitative assay.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Quality Control:

Each test cassette contains two internal process controls: an internal positive control and a negative control. The positive control is a non-infectious RNA molecule of the MS2 bacteriophage. The negative control is a non-RSV nucleic acid capture probe intended to monitor for non-specific binding. Each test kit also contains separate control swabs with inactivated RSV virus as well as a negative control swab to verify reagent integrity. The manufacturer recommends positive controls be run for each new lot or shipment of kits received, and for each new operator performing the test. Additional positive control swabs are available for purchase from the manufacturer.

# Specimen Stability

Contrived samples of RSV A were tested in triplicate on the Accula RSV assay in an experiment to determine specimen stability. Samples were prepared near the empirical LoD in pooled negative matrix containing the Accula RSV nasal swab buffer solution and stored under various conditions. The contrived specimens were prepared by spiking cultured viruses onto rayon-tipped swabs, which were then dipped into pooled negative nasal swab matrix (PNNS); the material was pooled and aliquoted into appropriately sized tubes for storage. Test conditions and the results of the testing are summarized in the table below:

Mesa Biotech has indicated that specimens should be transferred to the nasal swab buffer sample tube immediately after collection and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for no longer than 24 hours. Swabs that have not been eluted into nasal swab buffer can be stored in the original swab packaging for up to two hours at room temperature. Tests supporting the storage of the un-eluted swab sample in the original packaging are described in the decision summary for CW180006.

# Shelf Life

Accula RSV test kits are being tested for shelf life by storage at $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for different lengths of time. At each time interval (day 0, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and at 3 month intervals beyond) stored test kits are used to test control swabs and simulated RSV samples prepared in clinical matrix. Contrived specimens are prepared in clinical matrix near the empirical LoD. Negative samples and control swabs are tested as one replicate. Acceptance criteria for shelf life studies are as follows: all positive samples and controls must yield a $100 \%$ positive rate and all negative samples and controls must yield a $100 \%$ negative rate. Tests were considered stable as long as they continued to produce positive results for positive samples and negative results for negative samples. Data generated so far demonstrates that the three lots tested are stable for the first three time points tested (up to and including 4 weeks). The firm will continue stability testing and the kit storage conditions for the Accula RSV test will be labeled as stable at $1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for the latest time period for which acceptance criteria have been met in the ongoing stability study. Expiration dating will be extended as the study continues provided that correct results are obtained for all three test lots during the testing period.

# d. Detection limit:

The objective of the Analytical Sensitivity Study was to identify the limit of detection (LoD) of the Accula RSV assay using characterized strains of RSV A and RSV B. Two RSV A strains (RSV A2 and RSV A Long) and two RSV B strains (RSV B1 and RSV B 18537) were tested in replicates of twenty (20) for each concentration. Clinical matrix was used as dilution material for all LoD determination/confirmation experiments.

To determine the limit of detection, a range-finding study was first conducted to establish the lower limit of analytical sensitivity using virus dilutions tested in replicates of $\mathrm { \tt n } { = } 5$ . Following identification of the lower end of the detectable concentrations in the range finding study, virus concentrations which produced at least 3/5 detectable results were tested in replicates of 20. If the dilution tested did not result in at least 19/20 “detected” results, a two-fold higher concentration was tested again with 20 replicates.The final concentrations whereby at least $9 5 \%$ of results $( \geq 1 9 / 2 0 )$ were positive for the target virus are shown in the table below:

# e. Analytical reactivity:

Inclusivity verification was evaluated for the Accula RSV test using nine RSV strains. The chosen strains represented clinical RSV A and RSV B isolates that were obtainable for testing. Virus was diluted into a pooled clinical matrix to create contrived samples at an estimated 2X LoD concentration based on the empirical LoD studies. Each strain was tested in triplicate. The RSV strains, test concentrations, and results are shown below:

# g. Interfering Substances:

To assess substances with the potential to interfere with the performance of the Accula RSV test, two RSV strains or a negative control were tested in replicates of three (3) with each interfering substance at the “worst case” concentration. The RSV strains selected for testing were RSV A2 and RSV B1. Virus was serially diluted into a pooled clinical matrix to achieve a 1.5X LoD concentration.

Each RSV strain was tested with the “worst case” interferent concentration, representing the highest concentration likely to be found in a respiratory sample.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable. Performance of the Accula RSV Test was evaluated against the comparator method in a prospective clinical study.   
b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable.

3. Clinical studies:

Clinical performance was evaluated in a multi-site study in the U.S. during the 2017- 2018 RSV season. Accula RSV was used to evaluate fresh, prospectively collected nasal swab specimens from children and adults with suspected respiratory infection and meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Samples were tested with the Accula RSV within one hour of sample collection. At all sites, one swab specimen was tested directly on the Accula RSV according to product instructions. The other swab was eluted in UTM and shipped to a reference laboratory for testing with a high performance, FDA-cleared molecular RSV assay. Elution and shipping of the reference swab sample was performed according to the kit instructions. Discrepant results were tested using alternative FDAcleared molecular assays at the reference laboratory.

A total of 749 subjects were enrolled in the study with 55 specimens found to be unevaluable. Of those 55 specimens that were unevaluable, 39 samples were rejected due to protocol deviations, and 16 samples returned invalid results after repeat testing. A total of 694 nasal swab specimens were considered evaluable for the purpose of data analysis in the accuracy study. Patient age and gender distribution for the evaluable specimens is presented in the table below:

During the prospective clinical study, the initial invalid rate was $4 . 2 \%$ (30/710) $9 5 \%$ CI: $3 . 0 \%$ to $6 . 0 \%$ ). After repeat testing (according to the product instructions) the invalid rate was $2 . 3 \%$ (16/710) $9 5 \%$ CI: $1 . 4 \%$ to $3 . 6 \% )$ ).
