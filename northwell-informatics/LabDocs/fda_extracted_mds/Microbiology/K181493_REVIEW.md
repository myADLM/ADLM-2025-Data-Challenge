The FilmArray BCID Panel Instruction Booklet was updated to Remove False Positive Warnings for Manufacturer-Specific Blood Culture Bottles

In 2014, BioFire reported an increased risk of false positive results (specifically for Enterococcus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) when the FilmArray BCID Panel is used with bioMérieux BacT/ALERT Standard Anaerobic (SN) blood culture bottles. The source of these false positive results was identified, corrected, and removed. Therefore, the limitation and similar warnings regarding this throughout the Instruction Booklet were removed.

# 4. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:

a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis.

Risk analysis was performed to identify risks, their possible causes, and appropriate control mechanisms. All risks were evaluated in the context of 21 CFR 807.81(a)(3) and FDA’s guidance document ‘510(k) Device Modifications: Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device’. Upon analysis, the following risks were found:

The assessment identified no new user risks for False Negative Results, False Negative Results, or user Injuries. · The firm identified two false-positive associated user risks. o The firm determined the false positive risk was low based on testing of ‘false bottle rings’ in automated blood culture instruments. The firm determined that the false positive risk is mitigated through the updated labeling which states that the FilmArray BCID Panel ‘results are intended to be interpreted in conjunction with Gram stain results’. o The firm determined that there is a risk that unpredictable and transient contamination of blood culture bottle media with nucleic acids from pathogens detected by the FilmArray BCID Panel affects assay performance and patient results.The firm determined that the risk is mitigated through the updated labeling which informs the user to not report conclusive findings unless FilmArray BCID Panel results are concordant with the clinical profile (i.e., other laboratory, epidemiological, or clinical findings).

b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied

In order to address the increased false positive risks for Enterococcus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa when the FilmArray BCID Panel is used with bioMérieux BacT/ALERT Standard Anaerobic (SN) blood culture bottles, BioFire identified the source of contamination (raw material, Gelatin Yeast PP90M DE), made corrections to the cleaning processes, manufacturing process, raw material specifications, and replaced the contaminating raw material with a similar but highly-filtered product.

Validation testing with three lots of the new raw material tested on the FilmArray BCID Panel demonstrated negative results for all 30 tests across all targets. BioFire believes that this test provides $90 \%$ confidence that SN bottles produced with the new PP90M MF raw material and manufacturing improvements will provide acceptable performance (i.e., lower than $5 \%$ False Positive rate). Additionally, the firm reported a reduction in falsepositive related customer complaints related to Enterococcus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa organism.

Interference testing was conducted to add two bioMerieux blood culture media bottle types (BacT/ALERT FA Plus and BacT/ALERT FN Plus) for use with the FilmArray BCID Panel. In the validation study, seven contrived blood culture samples (six positive and one negative) were spiked with panel organism into (3) bottle types (BacT/ALERT FA Plus and BacT/ALERT FN Plus and the control BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F) and tested with the FilmArray BCID Panel. All 21 runs were valid with passed controls and no errors or unexpected results demonstrating that the resin-containing BacT/ALERT FA Plus and BacT/ALERT FN Plus bottle types do not interfere with the FilmArray BCID Panel and results are equivalent to those obtained with the BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F bottle.

Analytical Specificity and Crossreactivity testing was conducted to update labeling with newly identified organism not previously found during the initial premarket analytical and clinical studies. BioFire identified organism through thru post-market surveillance, customer investigations, organism re-classifications (literature). In-house Exclusivity testing was conducted on available organism using the protocol used to characterize the initial FilmArray Blood Culture Identification Panel assays. In-house validation testing and literature review identified multiple re-classifications and cross-reactant organisms to the current FilmArray BCID Panel assay. All identified crossreactants were added to the FilmArray BCID Panel Instruction Booklet Predicted and Observed Cross-Reactivity with On-Panel or Off-Panel Organisms table as crossreactants and noted as limitations in other appropriate locations in the FilmArray BCID Instruction Booklet. The new CrossReactive Organisms are bolded in table below.
