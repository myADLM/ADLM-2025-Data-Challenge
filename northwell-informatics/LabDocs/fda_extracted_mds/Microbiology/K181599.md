Dear Radha Goolabsingh:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's

requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/CombinationProducts/GuidanceRegulatoryInformation/ucm597488.htm); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

Device Name UniCel DxH 800 Coulter Cellular Analysis System with Early Sepsis Indicator Application

Indications for Use (Describe) The Unicel DxH 800 Coulter Cellular Analysis System with Early Sepsis Indicator Application is the quantitative measurement of Monocyte Distribution Width (MDW). The Early Sepsis Indicator is intended for use with adult patients presenting to the emergency department, on whom a white cell differential test has been ordered.

MDW is measured from a (K2EDTA) whole-blood venous sample within 2 hours of collection. MDW values greater than 20.0 together with other laboratory findings and clinical information, aids in identifying patients with sepsis or at increased risk of developing sepsis within the first 12 hours of hospital admission.

MDW values greater than 20.0 should be interpreted in association with other clinical information and diagnostic testing, as a proportion of patients without sepsis may have an elevated MDW value at baseline.

MDW values less than or equal to 20.0 cannot rule out sepsis or the development of sepsis within 12 hours of hospital admission. The Early Sepsis Indicator should not be used as the sole basis to determine the absence of sepsis.

The predictive value of the Early Sepsis Indicator for identifying sepsis in patients with hematological abnormalities has not been established.

This section applies only to requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.

# Device Description

# Systems Overview

The Early Sepsis Indicator (ESI) requires the use of the UniCel DxH 800 Coulter Cellular Analysis System $\mathrm { ( D x H ~ 8 0 0 ) }$ and its reagents, controls and calibrators last cleared under 510(k) K140911.

The UniCel DxH 800 Coulter Cellular Analysis System contains a quantitative, automated hematology analyzer $\mathrm { ( D x H 8 0 0 ) }$ ) designed for in vitro diagnostic use in screening patient populations by clinical laboratories. The system provides a Complete Blood Count (CBC), Leukocyte 5 Part Differential (Diff), Reticulocyte (Retic), Nucleated Red Blood Cell (NRBC) on whole blood, as well as, Total Nucleated Count (TNC), and Red Cell Count (RBC) on Body Fluids (cerebrospinal, serous and synovial). This submission adds a new parameter, Monocyte Distribution Width (MDW) to those mentioned above. This parameter has been shown to aid in the early detection of Sepsis in emergency room patients.

The system consists of two primary components, the workstation and the $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0$ analyzer as shown in Figure 1. DxH 800 System Configuration. The primary function of the DxH 800 analyzer is to process samples and provide results to the workstation. The primary functions of the workstation are: user interface, system control, results processing and storage and external communications. The analyzer runs embedded code and the workstation runs Microsoft Windows 7 Operating System (OS).

Optionally, the workstation can be connected to:

 A printer for creating reports;   
 A Laboratory Information System (LIS) for receiving test orders and releasing results; and   
 Pro-Service Remote Management System (RMS) which provides secure access to the $\mathrm { D x H 8 0 0 }$ workstation for BCI Service Personnel to perform troubleshooting, system monitoring and for assisting customers.

The version of the system proposed in this submission is $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 ~ \mathrm { v } 3 . 8 . 0$ This system is an update to $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 3 . 0 . 0$ (see K140911) to add a new feature.

Neither the system architecture nor the top-level software architecture have been modified from $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } 3 . 0$ to add the Early Sepsis Indicator feature.

The $\mathrm { D x H } 8 0 0 \mathrm { v } . 3 . 8 . 0$ user interface and labeling will be offered in English in the U.S. and in French, German, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese and English outside the U.S.

# Intended Use:

# UniCel DxH 800 Coulter Cellular Analysis System with Early Sepsis Indicator Application:

The Unicel $\mathrm { D x H } ~ 8 0 0$ Coulter Cellular Analysis System with Early Sepsis Indicator Application is the quantitative measurement of Monocyte Distribution Width (MDW). The Early Sepsis Indicator is intended for use with adult patients presenting to the emergency department, on whom a white cell differential test has been ordered.

MDW is measured from a (K2EDTA) whole-blood venous sample within 2 hours of collection. MDW values greater than 20.0 together with other laboratory findings and clinical information, aids in identifying patients with sepsis or at increased risk of developing sepsis within the first 12 hours of hospital admission.

MDW values greater than 20.0 should be interpreted in association with other clinical information and diagnostic testing, as a proportion of patients without sepsis may have an elevated MDW value at baseline.

MDW values less than or equal to 20.0 cannot rule out sepsis or the development of sepsis within 12 hours of hospital admission. The Early Sepsis Indicator should not be used as the sole basis to determine the absence of sepsis.

The predictive value of the Early Sepsis Indicator for identifying sepsis in patients with hematological abnormalities has not been established.

# Substantial Equivalence Conclusion:

The conclusions drawn from the testing discussed in Section 20, which demonstrate clinical accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of the MDW parameter and together with multiple literature citations (as provided in this submission), supports the use of MDW as an aid in the early detection of adult patients with or developing sepsis.

Furthermore, it can be concluded that the submitted information in this premarket notification is complete, offers a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness and supports a substantial equivalence determination for the $\mathrm { D x H } ~ 8 0 0$ Coulter Cellular Analysis System with Early Sepsis Indicator Application.
