# L. Test Principle:

The BD MAX Enteric Parasite Control Panel and BD MAX Enteric Parasite 20-Day QC Panel are intended for use as external assayed quality control materials for use in monitoring the DNA extraction, amplification and detection processes associated with the BD MAX Enteric Parasite Panel (K143648) performed on the BD MAX System.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The reproducibility of results obtained with the BD MAX Enteric Parasite control panels was evaluated in a study performed at three sites over five days, with two operators per site. Each operator tested three lyophilized control pellets on each day of the study according to the instructions for use (3 sites x 5 days $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ operators $_ { \textrm { X 3 } }$ replicates $= 9 0$ replicates in total). Controls associated with incomplete instrument runs (2) or that produced unresolved results (1) were retested using a new control pellet according to the Instructions For Use. A Negative Control consisting of molecular grade water (not provided in the BD MAX Enteric Parasite Control and 20- Day QC Panels) was also tested at least once a day on each instrument to monitor for contamination. The results of the study are summarized in Table 1. All Negative Controls and produced the expected results.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable.   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Stability

Reagent shelf-life was established in an Accelerated Stability Study that was performed with three lots of BD MAX Enteric Parasite Panel controls that were placed at 43, 53 or $6 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 42 days. All results were as expected and there was no evidence of product degradation under the conditions tested. The results of this study were used to support a claimed shelf-life of 18 months at $2 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , which will be verified through a Real-time Stability Study.

# Expected Values

The BD MAX Enteric Parasite Control and 20-Day QC Panels are expected to produce positive results for G. lamblia, C. parvum and $E .$ . histolytica when tested with the BD MAX Enteric Parasite Panel on the BD MAX System.
