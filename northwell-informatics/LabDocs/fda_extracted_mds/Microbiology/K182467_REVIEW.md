# A Device Description:

The Simplexa GBS Direct assay is an in vitro diagnostic, real-time PCR amplification test for the direct, qualitative detection of Group B Streptococcus DNA in vaginal/rectal swab specimens from antepartum women that have been incubated for 18-24 hours in Lim enrichment broth. The assay is performed on the LIAISON MDX instrument which is controlled by an external computer equipped with LIAISON MDX Studio Software.

The assay kit comprises frozen PCR mixture containing primers and probes to detect a conserved region of the Group B Streptococcus genome and an Internal Control sequence and which is designed to monitor reagent and system integrity.

The Simplexa GBS Direct assay is performed by manually pipetting PCR reagents and test samples into disposables called DADs (Direct Amplification Discs) that comprise eight segments or wedges, each of which may be used to test a separate specimen or control. After sealing the foil on each wedge, the DAD is loaded into the LIAISON MDX instrument and the run is initiated. The system uses a combination of centrifugal force and laser-controlled valves to combine metered aliquots of the unextracted samples and PCR reagents in the assay chamber of each wedge. Amplification, fluorescence-based detection and result interpretation occur automatically.

# B Principle of Operation:

The Simplexa GBS Direct assay uses real-time PCR amplification with fluorescently-labeled probes to detect a conserved region of the S. agalactiae cfb gene in Lim broth enrichment cultures of vaginal/rectal swabs obtained from pregnant women.

Vaginal/rectal swab specimens are cultured for 18-24 hours in Lim broth after which a sample of the medium is transferred to one wedge of a DAD (Direct Amplification Disc) to which the operator also adds an aliquot of the PCR reagents via a separate port. After sealing the DAD and loading the LIAISON MDX instrument, the sample and PCR mixture are combined for automated amplification, detection and result interpretation. Results are displayed on the computer screen as “GBS Detected”, GBS Not Detected” or “Invalid” (due to failure of the Internal Control or inadequate sample volume) and may be printed.

1. Instrument Name:

LIAISON MDX

2. Specimen Identification:

Specimens are identified by scanning a bar code label or by typing in an appropriate identifier.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The Simplexa GBS Direct assay is for use with Lim broth enrichment cultures of vaginal/rectal swabs that have been incubated for 18-24 hours. To process a sample, an aliquot of the broth culture medium is added directly to the sample port of one wedge/segment of a Direct Amplification Disc (DAD) and an aliquot of PCR mixture is added to the reagent port. The wedge is then sealed and the DAD loaded into the LIAISON MDX instrument.

4. Calibration:

End-user calibration for the LIAISON MDX instrument is not necessary. Calibration of the optical modules (excitation and emission gain settings) is performed during the manufacturing process and the values are stored in the instrument firmware.

5. Quality Control:

The analytical specificity of the Simplexa GBS Direct assay was evaluated by testing 75 organisms and viruses that were seeded into 18-24 hour GBS-negative Lim broth enrichment cultures of vaginal/rectal swabs (Table 3). Unless otherwise noted in the table, the bacteria and yeast species were tested at $1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ and viruses were tested at $1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { T C I D } 5 0 / \mathrm { m L }$ . Parasites and white blood cells were tested at $1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { c e l l s / m L }$ . A minimum of three assay replicates were evaluated under each test condition. No evidence of cross-reaction with the Simplexa GBS Direct primers and probes was observed.

Because some organisms and viruses were not available for testing or could not be obtained at high concentration, additional in silico analysis was performed using the Simplexa GBS Direct primer and probe sequences as queries for organism-specific BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) analysis of the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology

Information) Nucleotide collection $( \mathrm { n r / n t } )$ database (Table 4). No homology was observed with the targeted organisms and viruses that was considered likely to result in amplification and/or detection.

# Microbial Interference

To evaluate the potential for interference with the Simplexa GBS Direct assay from microbial flora that may be present in vaginal/rectal swab specimens, testing was performed with GBS positive samples in the presence of each of the organisms and viruses that were in the Cross-reactivity Study (Table 3), and at the same concentrations. Each species was tested in Lim broth-enriched vaginal/rectal matrix in the presence of two strains of GBS (ATCC BAA-22 and ATCC BAA-1138) at 2X LoD $1 . 6 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ and $6 \times 1 0 ^ { 4 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ , respectively). Testing under each condition was initially performed in triplicate and additional replicates were evaluated in the event of a failure (i.e., a false negative result).

No false negative results were observed in the presence of any of the potentially interfering organisms or viruses with GBS strain ATCC BAA-22. However, with GBS strain ATCC BAA-1138, at least one false negative result was obtained on initial testing with each of the species listed in Table 5. The potential for interference by these species with the detection of GBS at low target levels is noted in the Limitations section of the device labeling.

# Interfering Substances

The potential for interference with the Simplexa GBS Direct assay was evaluated with a variety of endogenous and exogenous substances that may be present in vaginal/rectal swab specimens (Table 6). Each substance was tested in Lim broth enriched vaginal/rectal swab matrix in the presence of two strains of GBS (ATCC BAA-22 and ATCC BAA-1183) at 2X LoD ${ 1 . 6 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 } }$ and $6 \times 1 0 ^ { 4 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ , respectively). A minimum of three replicates were tested under each

condition. If interference was observed, additional testing was performed at lower concentrations of the substance to determine at what concentration the adverse effect on assay performance was alleviated.

False negative and/or Invalid results were observed with one or both strains of GBS with fecal fat, meconium, seminal fluid, stool, Gaviscon, Nexium, mesalazine, barium sulfate and the nonsteroidal inflammatory drug, Naproxen. Although the potential for interference by these substances is noted in the device labeling, the risk to patients is considered low because of the diluting effect of the Lim broth culture medium on the contents of a vaginal/rectal swab and the high target levels present in GBS positive Lim broth cultures.

4. Assay Reportable Range:

Not applicable.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

Sample Stability The stability of samples prior to testing with the Simplexa GBS Direct assay was evaluated using 18-24 hour Lim broth cultures of vaginal/rectal swabs that were inoculated with

different concentrations two strains of $S .$ . agalactiae at levels ranging from 2 to 50X LoD. The samples were held at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for different periods prior to testing. At each inoculum concentration, there was a decrease in Ct values over time. The results of the study support the stability of enriched Lim broth cultures of vaginal/rectal swabs for up to 7 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Internal Control

The Simplexa GBS Direct reaction mix includes an Internal Control that is amplified with a different pair of PCR primers than the GBS target and which is detected in a separate optical channel. The Internal Control is designed to monitor for reagent and process integrity.

# External Controls

Clinical Study: Positive and Negative External Controls were tested on each LIAISON MDX instrument on each day that patient specimens were evaluated during the prospective Clinical Study (Decision Summary Section X.C(1)). The Simplexa GBS Direct Positive Control was used as the Positive External Control. Uninoculated Lim broth was used as the Negative External Control. A total of 68 pairs of Positive and Negative External Controls were tested during the study, all of which $( 1 0 0 \% )$ produced the expected results.

Lot-to-Lot Precision: The lot-to-lot precision of the Simplexa GBS Direct Positive Control was evaluated in a study conducted over a period of three days with a single LIAISON MDX instrument and a single lot of Simplexa GBS Direct reaction mixture. On each day of testing, two replicates of each lot of Positive Control were tested twice in different runs (3 days X 2 replicates X 3 lots $X 2 \mathrm { r u n s } = 3 6$ replicates). Negative Controls were tested daily to monitor for contamination. All qualitative test results were as expected (Table 7) and the Simplexa GBS Direct Positive Control was shown to exhibit acceptable precision between lots.

6. Detection Limit:

# Limit of Detection

The Limit of Detection (LoD) of the Simplexa GBS Direct assay was established by testing enumerated stocks of two strains of S. agalactiae that were diluted in Lim broth-enriched vaginal/rectal swab matrix. For each strain, results from a total of 32 valid assay replicates were obtained at each of eight target concentrations. The study was performed using two lots of Simplexa GBS Direct reagents and four LIAISON MDX instruments. The LoD was defined as the lowest concentration at which $2 9 5 \%$ of replicates produced a positive result. The LoD for ATCC BAA-22 (serotype III) was $8 0 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ and that for ATCC BAA1138 (serotype Ia) was $3 0 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ . These results are acceptable.

Analytical Reactivity/Inclusivity

The inclusivity of the Simplexa GBS Direct assay was evaluated by testing 18 different strains of S. agalactiae in addition to those included in the LoD Study (Table 8). Each strain was tested in triplicate in Lim broth cultured vaginal/rectal swab matrix at 110,000 CFU/mL (2X the average LoD for strains ATCC BAA-22 and ATCC BAA-1138). All the replicates of each of strain produced positive results. These results are acceptable.

# Bioinformatic Analysis

Bioinformatic analysis using Nucleotide-Nucleotide BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) showed that the region of the $c f b$ gene targeted by the Simplexa GBS Direct primers and probe is well conserved between strains, with no evidence of mismatches that are predicted to affect the efficiency detection.

# 7. Assay Cut-Off:

Samples tested with the Simplexa GBS Direct assay are dispositioned as Positive, Negative or Invalid based on the comparison of Cycle Threshold (Ct) values observed in the optical channels for GBS and the Internal Control targets to previously determined cut-offs. The Ct cut-offs were established during development of the assay and validated in the Clinical Study described in Decision Summary Section X.C(1).

8. Accuracy (Instrument): Not applicable.

9. Carry-Over:

A study to assess the potential for carry-over/cross-contamination was conducted with the Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct assay (K120413). The study design was determined to be acceptable and no evidence of contamination was observed. Because of the similarities in format and assay workflow with this previously cleared device, no additional contamination studies were conducted with the Simplexa GBS Direct assay.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device: Not applicable.

2. Matrix Comparison: Not applicable.

# C Clinical Studies:

# 1. Clinical Sensitivity:

The performance of the Simplexa GBS Direct assay was evaluated in a prospective Clinical Study that was conducted at four (4) sites in the U.S. using de-identified enriched Lim broth cultures of vaginal/rectal swabs from pregnant women that were left over from routine diagnostic testing for GBS. A total of 804 enriched Lim broth cultures were initially enrolled, of which 372 were excluded from the analysis of performance for the following protocol violations: the duration of incubation of the Lim broth was not recorded ${ \bf \tilde { n } } = 2 3 9$ , including all those obtained from Site #3); incubation of the Lim broth culture exceeded 24 hours $\mathbf { \tilde { n } = }$ 115); the sample was a duplicate from a previously enrolled subject $( \mathtt { n } = 1 2 )$ ); testing was performed with the incorrect Simplexa Assay Definition software $( \mathtt { n } = 4 )$ ; no Simplexa test result was obtained $( \mathbf { n } = 1 )$ ); the subject was male $( \mathbf { n } = 1 )$ ). Lim broth cultures of vaginal/rectal swabs from a total of 432 antepartum women at 35-37 weeks of gestation were therefore included in the performance evaluation. The subjects ranged from 18 to 45 years of age.

Following 18-24 hour incubation of the Lim enrichment broth at each site, separate aliquots were prepared for testing with the Simplexa GBS Direct assay and for shipment to a central laboratory for reference culture and organism identification (i.e., subculture to non-selective blood agar and selective CNA (colistin-nalidixic acid) agar, followed by Gram staining of suspected colonies of S. agalactiae, catalase testing (S. agalactiae is catalase negative) and latex agglutination using GBS-specific reagents). Agar plates were incubated for a minimum of 48 hours before being discarded as GBS negative. The results of the study are summarized in Tables 9 and 10.

No Invalid results were reported among the 432 samples included in the analysis of performance for the Simplexa GBS Direct assay (Invalid Rate $0 \%$ (0/432)).

These results are acceptable.

# E Expected Values/Reference Range:

The performance of the Simplexa GBS Direct assay was evaluated in a prospective Clinical Study of pregnant women at 35-37 weeks of gestation with samples from three (3) sites in the

U.S. (Decision Summary Section X.C(1)). The overall prevalence of GBS colonization as determined by the Simplexa GBS Direct assay was $2 5 . 5 \%$ (110/432), whereas by conventional culture it was $2 3 . 1 \%$ (100/432). In Table 11, the prevalence of GBS colonization as determined by the Simplexa GBS Direct assay is shown stratified by clinical site.
