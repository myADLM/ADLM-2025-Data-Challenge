# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Studies to determine precision and reproducibility of the Cepheid Xpert GBS LB Control Panel were performed on the GeneXpert Instrument using the Cepheid Xpert GBS LB assay. Testing was done at three different locations over five days. At each location, two operators each tested three different lots of control material for a total of 90 test results each for the Positive and Negative Control swabs (3 sites x 5 days x 2 operators x 3 replicates $= 9 0$ replicates in total). A summary of the qualitative results for both the Positive and Negative Controls are provided in Table 2. All Positive Controls produced the expected Positive result, although one control was re-tested due to an instrument ERROR which indicated that the assay was aborted. When retested, the Positive Control produced the expected result. All Negative Controls produced the expected Negative result.

1 One ERROR result was observed for the positive control. Both the positive control and negative control were re-tested, as indicated in the test protocol. 2 Data from the test run with the ERROR result was not included in the Percent Correct analysis.

The reproducibility of the Cepheid Xpert GBS LB Control Panel within and between test locations, GeneXpert Instruments, operators, and lots was determined to be acceptable.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability:

Not applicable.

# Stability:

1. Shelf-life stability was established through an Accelerated Stability Study that was performed with three lots of the Positive Control from the Cepheid Xpert GBS LB Control Panel. The Positive Control was placed at elevated temperatures $4 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $5 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $6 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and tested in four replicates at four time points (Day 0, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42). When the stability of the product was evaluated qualitatively, all analytes tested positive on the GeneXpert Instrument System using the Cepheid Xpert GBS LB assay. Thus, the data provided no evidence of product degradation under the conditions tested and may support shelf-life claims of 24 months.

2. A Real-Time, Shelf-Life Stability Study is in process with a goal of a 24 months stability claim. Positive Control samples incubated at two temperatures ( $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ will be qualitatively tested four times throughout a 25 months study (four samples/sampling). Testing is expected to be completed by 08/27/2020.

3. An In-Use Stability Study was done to determine if the Positive and Negative Control products would remain stable for five hours after hydration to demonstrate stability of the product within the recommended time frame of use (i.e., ${ \le } 1 5$ minutes). Two replicates from a single lot were hydrated and set aside (in a centrifuge tube) at room temperature $( 2 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . Samples were tested on the GeneCpert System after zero, four, and six hours and gave expected values indicating that the product may be hydrated and used within a six hour period without concern of performance.

# Expected Values:

The Cepheid Xpert GBS LB Control Panel is a qualitative conrol expected to produce positive results with the Positive Control (Streptococcus agalactiae) and negative results with the Negative Control (Lactobacillus acidophilus) when tested with the Cepheid Xpert GBS LB assay using the GeneXpert Instrument System.
