# 510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION DECISION SUMMARY ASSAY ONLY TEMPLATE

# B. Purpose for Submission:

To obtain a substantial equivalence determination for a modification of the PREMIER Platinum HpSA PLUS

# E. Applicant:

# G. Regulatory Information:

1. Regulation section: 21 CFR 866.3110; Campylobacter fetus serological reagents

2. Classification: Class I

3. Product code: LYR – Campylobacter pylori

4. Panel:

83-Microbiology

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The PREMIER Platinum HpSA PLUS enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is an in vitro qualitative procedure for the detection of Helicobacter pylori antigens in human stool. Test results are intended to aid in the diagnosis of H. pylori infection and to monitor response during and post-therapy in patients. Accepted medical practice recommends that testing by any current method, to confirm eradication, be done at least four weeks following completion of therapy.

2. Indication(s) for use: Same as the Intended Use.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only.

4. Special instrument requirements:

A spectrophotometric plate reader capable of reading the following wavelengths: $4 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ or $4 5 0 / 6 3 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .

# I. Device Description:

The PREMIER Platinum HpSA PLUS test is a microwell-based enzyme immunoassay that detects $H .$ . pylori antigens present in human stool. This version of the assay has several modifications compared to the earlier version, including a replacement capture/conjugate monoclonal minor antibody and capture/conjugate monoclonal major antibody propogated by different methods. Additionally, the positive control reagent final acceptance criteria have been modified, concurrent with the minor antibody change.

The test utilizes a plurality (mixture) of monoclonal anti-H. pylori capture antibodies adsorbed to microwells. Diluted patient samples and an enzyme conjugate reagent are added to the microwells and incubated for one hour at room temperature. A wash is performed to remove unbound material. Substrate is added and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. Color develops in the presence of bound enzyme. Stop solution is added and the results are interpreted visually or spectrophotometrically. No calculations are required and the visual color change makes the interpretation of results objective and simple. The color, if positive, is a yellow color that may be read visually or by using a spectrophotometer at the following wavelengths: $4 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ or $4 5 0 / 6 3 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ .

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Studies were performed to demonstrate the inter-laboratory and intra-laboratory reproducibility of the modified device. Testing was performed by two technologists in three separate laboratories over the course of five days. Each technologist was supplied with a panel of blinded specimens prior to testing. The specimen panels were tested according to the package insert method.

Contrived specimen panels were prepared by spiking $H .$ pylori purified flaggelar antigen (H. pylori ATCC 43504) into negative pooled stool at antigen concentrations above, near and below the assay limit of detection for H. pylori antigen. Each panel consisted of one negative, three high negatives (0.1x LoD), three low positives (2x LoD), and three moderate positive (5x LoD) specimens, that were randomly sorted within each panel. Negative and positive controls were run on each day of testing. Three kit lots were used during the study. Results were interpreted using either single or dual wavelength spectrophotometric reads. The study results are summarized in Table 1. No differences were observed for single or dual wavelength spectrophotometric reads. The reproducibility performance was acceptable.

# Cross-reactivity

The specificity of the modified PREMIER Platinum HpSA PLUS was tested with the bacterial, viral, and fungal strains listed in Table 2, below. Positive and negative stools (unpreserved pooled negative human stool, previously screened by the

modified and predicate device) were spiked with $1 . 0 { \mathrm { x } } 1 0 ^ { 7 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ bacteria and fungi. Viruses were spiked at a final concentration greater than $\mathrm { 1 x 1 0 ^ { 5 } \ T C I D { 5 0 } / m L }$ . None of the microorganisms tested yielded a positive result in the negative stool or interfered with detection of $H .$ . pylori antigen in positive stool.

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Method comparison testing was done to compare performance of the modified PREMIER Platinum HpSA PLUS, using a replacement capture/conjugate monoclonal minor antibody and capture/conjugate monoclonal major antibody propogated by different methods, to that of the predicate device.

Testing was performed on 159 archived, unpreserved clinical stool specimens. The specimens were collected from individuals with signs and symptoms of $H .$ . pylori infection (from the Intended Use Population). Three lots of the modified device were tested. When compared to results obtained with the predicate, the percent positive and percent negative agreements were $100 \%$ . The results are summarized in Table 3 below.

The percent positive and negative agreements compared to the predicate device were $100 \%$ (57/57, $\mathrm { C I } = 9 3 . 7 \% - 1 0 0 \% )$ and $100 \%$ (102/102, $\mathrm { C I } = 9 6 . 4 \% - 1 0 0 \% )$ , respectively. These results are acceptable.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Studies on the epidemiology of $H .$ . pylori have shown that this organism is present worldwide. Gastritis caused by $H .$ pylori has been shown to correlate with age, ethnic background, family size and socioeconomic class. The prevalence of $H .$ . pylori infection in a given population can vary from $20 \%$ to $90 \%$ . In patients diagnosed with duodenal ulcers, however, it has been shown in every age group to be approximately $80 \%$ . Currently recommended eradication treatments have an efficacy rate between $7 5 \%$ and $90 \%$ .

The modified Premier Platinum HpSA PLUS test detects the prescence of $H .$ . pylori antigens in human stool. Expected values for a given population should be determined for each laboratory. The rate of positivity may vary depending on geographic location, method of specimen collection, handling and transportation, test employed and general health environment of the patient population under study.
