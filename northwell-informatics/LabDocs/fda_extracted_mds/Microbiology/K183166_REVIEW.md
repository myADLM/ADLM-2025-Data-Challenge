3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only.

4. Special instrument requirements: BacT/ALERT (BTA) 3D Microbial Detection System or BTA VIRTUO Microbial Detection System

# I. Device Description:

The BacT/ALERT Microbial Detection System and BTA VIRTUO Microbial Detection System provide both a microbial detection system and a culture medium bottle with suitable nutritional and environmental conditions for microorganisms commonly encountered in blood taken from a patient suspected of having bacteremia/fungemia. The BacT/ALERT FA Plus and BacT/ALERT PF Plus culture media formulation was adjusted to add essential elements and to remove non-essential trace components.

For both the BacT/ALERT PF Plus and BacT/ALERT FA Plus culture bottles, an inoculated bottle is placed into the instrument where it is incubated and continuously monitored for the presence of microorganisms that will grow in the culture bottles.

The BacT/ALERT Microbial Detection System and BTA VIRTUO Microbial Detection System utilize a colorimetric sensor and reflected light to monitor the presence and production of carbon dioxide $\left( \mathbf { C O } _ { 2 } \right)$ that is dissolved in the culture medium. If microorganisms are present in the test sample, carbon dioxide is produced as the microorganisms metabolize the substrates in the culture medium. When growth of the microorganisms produces $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ , the color of the gas-permeable sensor installed in the bottom of each culture bottle changes from blue-green to yellow. The lighter color results in an increase of reflectance units monitored by the system. Bottle reflectance is monitored and recorded by the instrument every 10 minutes.

# L. Test Principle:

The BacT/ALERT Microbial Detection System and BTA VIRTUO Microbial Detection Systems utilize a colorimetric sensor and reflected light to monitor the prescence and production of carbon dioxide $\left( \mathbf { C O } _ { 2 } \right)$ dissolved in the culture medium. If microorganisms are present in the test sample, carbon dioxide is produced as the microorganisms metabolizee the substrates in the culture medium. When growth of the microorganisms produces $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ , the color of the gas-permeable sensor installed in thebottom of each culture bottle changes from blue-green to yellow. The ligher color results in an increase of reflectance units monitored by the system. Bottle reflectance is monitored by the system. Bottle reflectance is monitored and recorded by the instrument every 10 minutes.

1. Analytical performance:

# Antimicrobial neutralization

An internal study was conducted to demonstrate that the adjusted media formulation does not impact the rate of recovery (percent) of microorganisms in the presence of antimicrobials. At least one antimicrobial agent from each class claimed in the FA Plus culture bottle package insert was evaluated in this study. Single agents and combinations of antimicrobials, in clinically relevant concentrations, were added to FA Plus bottles with the susceptible aerobic and facultative anaerobic microorganisms listed in Table 1 and Table 2. The targeted inoculum for each microorganism was 10-100 CFU/bottle. The actual inoculum ranged from 15 CFU/bottle to 109 CFU/bottle. All organisms were added to FA Plus bottles that were supplemented with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to simulate a challenging environment with limited nutrients and high antimicrobial bioavailability. In addition, a subset of organisms were added to bottles supplemented with blood. Adjusted BTA FA Plus bottles were tested on both the BTA 3D and BTA VIRTUO Microbial Detection Systems. The effectiveness of the antimicrobials was confirmed by parallel testing using a non-neutralizing medium as a control.

Antimicrobial neutralization was evaluated with at least three lots of adjusted FA Plus culture bottles for each tested microorganism/antimicrobial. For each microorganism/antimicrobial, at least six bottles were inoculated and tested on the BTA 3D or the BTA VIRTUO. Testing of all antimicrobials was evaluated at $100 \%$ Peak Serum Level (PSL), unless otherwise noted. Antimicrobials were considered effectively neutralized by the adjusted FA Plus bottle based on $100 \%$ recovery of the microorganisms tested at the indicated percent of PSL tested.

The study demonstrated that antimicrobials from the following categories were neutralized by the adjusted FA Plus media, resulting in a positive bottle signal (as expected) within five days of inoculation: penicillins, glycylcyclines, polyenes, macrolides, triazoles, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, lincosamides, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones.

Antimicrobial neutralization was also achieved for ceftaroline.

Antimicrobial neutralization was not achieved for S. aureus with the following single and combinations of antimicrobials: Cefoxitin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Vancomycin $^ +$ Piperacillin/Tazobactam, and Daptomycin $^ +$ Piperacillin /Tazobactam. In addition, antimicrobial neutralization was not achieved for $C .$ . albicans grown in the presence of Caspofungin, an echinocandin. Based on the $C .$ . albicans/Caspofungin result, follow up testing was conducted with five additional echinocandin/yeast pairs. All additional echinocandin/yeast pairs demonstrated $100 \%$ microorganism recovery.

Less than complete neutralization was observed for cefazolin. Cefazolin was neutralized at $50 \%$ PSL for $E .$ . coli in PBS.

Antimicrobial neutralization study results are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2 for single and combinations of antimicrobial agents, respectively. Table 3 illustrates results of follow up testing with additional echinocandin/yeast pairs.

# Delayed Entry

An internal study was conducted to evaluate the effect of a delay, from the time the adjusted FA Plus culture bottle was inoculated, to the time the bottle was placed on the instrument. This seeded study was conducted using three lots of adjusted FA Plus culture bottles. Three replicate suspensions of each of the following 11 species were evaluated: Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. Target concentrations of $\leq 1 0 0$ CFU per bottle (actual inoculum levels from 16 CFU/bottle to 97 CFU/bottle) were prepared in 0, 4, and $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ human blood. Testing in the absence of blood was performed to simulate the worst case scenario for normally sterile body fluids. Four and ten mL blood represent the recommended fill volume for pediatric and adult bottles, respectively. Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis were inoculated into bottles supplemented with 1, 4, 10 or 4 and $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ blood, respectively. Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis were only inoculated with blood added due to growth requirements. Sixty negative controls (i.e., bottles containing blood and media alone without organism) were evaluated on both the BTA 3D and BTA VIRTUO instruments. All samples were held at the specified temperatures and times prior to loading into the BTA 3D or BTA VIRTUO instruments. Percent recovery reflects time to positive flag by the instrument.

The study demonstrated that all delayed entry conditions showed $2 1 0 0 \%$ percent recovery of inoculated organisms, except for delayed entry at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 48 hours. Holding bottles at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 48 hours is not a claim in the adjusted FA Plus package insert. These results are acceptable.

\*Two bottles were removed from analysis due to contamination, leaving 58 bottles for percent recovery calculations. Two of the remaining 58 bottles yielded false positive results.

# a. Precision:

# Within-laboratory Precision

Within-laboratory precision was evaluated by conducting an in-house seeded study over 19 days using multiple systems (BTA 3D and BTA VIRTUO), varied blood contents (0, 4, and $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ ), adjusted FA Plus bottles lots, and operators. The combined data from a total of 717 bottles was used to evaluate the percent recovery for the species listed in Table 5a. Three of the species were tested with the addition of antimicrobial agents: Escherichia coli – Amikacin $( 3 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ ), Pseudomonas aeruginosa – Pipercillin ( $4 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } ,$ , and Staphylococcus aureus – Vancomycin $( 5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ . All species were seeded into adjusted FA Plus bottles at a target inoculum of $\leq 1 0 0$ CFU/bottle (actual inoculum from 16 CFU/bottle to 109 CFU/bottle).. Percent recovery reflects positive flag by the instrument and sub-culture consistent with the appopriate seeded organism. Mean TTD reflects the average time to detection for all evaluated microorganisms, combined. The study demonstrated that percent recovery was $100 \%$ for yeast and bacteria with and without blood supplementation (Table 5a). Percent recovery was not affected by adjusted FA Plus bottle lot.

b. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# External QC Testing

During the analytical studies, daily external quality control was conducted on the BTA 3D system and included positive and negative control bottles. Control organisms were seeded into bottles at target inoculum levels of 10-100 CFU/bottle, with actual inoculums ranging from 36 CFU/bottle to 91 CFU/bottle. Organism concentrations for bottle seeding were confirmed by plate counting procedures. One obligate aerobe ( $P .$ . aeruginosa) and two facultative organisms $E$ . coli and S. aureus) were evaluated. On each testing day, at least two quality control organisms were evaluated. In addition, uninoculated negative control bottles were tested daily. $100 \%$ of positive controls generated the expected positive signal by BTA 3D and $100 \%$ of negative controls were reported as negative.

# Stability of the adjusted BTA FA Plus bottle (shelf-life)

Studies were conducted to determine the adjusted FA Plus bottle shelf-life. Three lots of adjusted FA Plus bottles produced for product validation and verification were tested until they were 13 months old. At the beginning of the study, a set of adjusted FA Plus bottles were stored under normal conditions $( 1 5 . 3 0 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { C } )$ while another set of bottles were thermally stressed before final storage under normal conditions. At each time point, growth performance ( $\%$ recovery and TTD), antimicrobial neutralization, and physical parameters were evaluated on the BTA 3D system. In addition, FA Plus bottles were evaluated to determine if they possessed sufficient vacuum to direct draw $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ blood. These studies demonstrated that stability can be achieved for the claimed shelf-life and that direct blood draw was maintained over the claimed shelflife.

# c. Detection limit:

# Limit of Detection $( L o D )$

An in-house LoD study was conducted with seeded samples to evaluate/confirm the LoD of the microorganisms in the adjusted FA Plus bottle based on the established LoD of the original bottle. All microorganisms were inoculated into adjusted FA Plus Bottles at specific organism concentrations based on the LoD of the predicate FA Plus bottle and different bottles were incubated on the BTA 3D and BTA VIRTUO Systems. Due to inherent inaccuracy in preparing suspensions of microorganisms at a low density, inoculum levels were deemed acceptable if they were within a factor of 2 ( $\underline { { { + 2 } } }$ -fold) of the previously established LoD for each detection system. The following 11 species were tested on the BTA 3D System: Candida albicans, Klebsiella (Enterococcus) aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Of the species evaluated on the BTA 3D System, all were tested on the BTA Virtuo System , except for Klebsiella (Enterococcus) aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella enterica. Three production lots of adjusted FA Plus Bottles were tested. A minimum of 60 bottles were tested for each species on each detection system. LoD was determined in the absence of blood for all organisms except $H .$ influenzae, which was supplemented with $4 \mathrm { m L }$ human blood due to growth requirements. At least $9 5 \%$ detection was achieved at the established LoD for all evaluated species, indicating that the LoD was the same in the adjusted and predicate FA Plus bottles.

# Percent Recovery (Detection) Study

An in-house seeded study was conducted to demonstrate that changes to the media formulation do not negatively impact percent recovery (detection). Percent recovery was evaluated in a head-to-head study of 2372 adjusted and predicate bottles, of which 1564 were supplemented with human blood (4 or $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ ) and 808 without blood. A set of 39 diverse microorganisms commonly found in blood were evaluated using three lots of the adjusted FA Plus bottle (a total of five different lots were tested) and two lots of the predicate. The species tested are listed in Table 6d. All organisms were seeded into adjusted FA Plus bottles at a target inoculum range of 10- 100 CFU/bottle (actual inoculum ranged from 3 CFU/bottle to 137 CFU/bottle). Seeded bottles were incubated on the BTA 3D and BTA VIRTUO Systems.

The adjusted FA Plus bottle was considered equivalent to the predicate based on the the Newcombe’s Hybrid Score CI of the percent recovery difference of the adjusted

bottle compared to the predicate bottle.

The overall detection rate was $9 6 . 0 \%$ for the predicate bottle and $9 5 . 7 \%$ for the adjusted bottle, with an overall difference in percent recovery of $0 . 3 \%$ . Results are shown in shown in Table 6a, stratified by inoculum level/blood content, and Table 6b, stratified by Detection System. Percent recovery results by adjusted bottle lot are illustrated in Table 6c.

The study demonstrated that the adjusted bottle performed equivalently when compared to the predicate bottle for all evaluated incolulum levels and blood volumes, except for an inoculum of ${ \tt > } 1 0 0$ CFU/bottle in the absence of blood. For this condition, the detection rate was $9 4 . 6 \%$ for the predicate bottle and $8 0 . 8 \%$ for the adjusted bottle, with a difference in percent recovery of $1 3 . 8 \%$ . It was noted that for this condition, all adjusted bottles $( \mathtt { n } = 1 8 )$ ) incoculated with $A$ . defectiva yielded negative results. Excluding $A$ . defectiva from the analysis, Newcombe’s Hybrid Score CI of the percent recovery difference between the adjusted and predicate FA Plus bottle met the acceptance criteria for equivalence. A note has been added to the adjusted FA Plus Package Insert indicating that detection of $A$ . defectiva necessitates blood.

In the adjusted bottle, percent recovery of bottles inoculated with $H .$ parainfluenzae (with blood supplementation) was $58 \%$ and percent recovery for $C .$ . hominis (without blood supplementation) was $50 \%$ . These results are consistent with what has previously been observed for these organisms/conditions and is reported in the predicate bottle Package Insert. The following notes have been maintained in the adjusted FA Plus bottle Package Insert.

· H. parainfluenzae is not always detected in the presence of blood C. hominis is not always detected in the absence of blood

In the adjusted bottle, without blood supplementation, less than $100 \%$ recovery was observed for the fastidious organisms N.gonorrhoea, N.menigitidis, $C .$ . jeikeium, $H .$ influenzae, and H. parainfluenzae. These results are consistent with results for these organisms grown in the predicate bottle without blood supplementation and denoted in the predicate Package Insert. A limitation that recovery of fastidious organisms requires blood supplementation has been maintained in the adjusted FA Plus Package Insert.

The adjusted bottle was found to be equivalent to the predicate when read on either the BTA 3D or BTA VIRTUO Systems. Percent recovery was not affected by the adjusted bottle lot.

# Time-To-Detection (TTD) Study

An in-house seeded study was conducted to demonstrate that changes to the media formulation do not negatively impact Time-To-Detection (TTD). TTD (in hours), was evaluated in a head-to-head study of 2372 adjusted and predicate bottles, of which 1564 were supplemented with blood (4 or $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ ) and 808 without blood. A set of 39 diverse species commonly found in blood were evaluated using three lots of the adjusted FA Plus bottle (five lots in total were tested) and two lots of the predicate. The species tested are the same as those listed in Table 6d, above. All organisms were seeded into adjusted FA Plus bottles at a target inoculum of 10-100 CFU/bottle. The actual inoculum ranged from 3 CFU/bottle to 137 CFU/bottle. Seeded bottles were read on the BTA 3D and BTA VIRTUO Systems.

To demonstrate equivalence, the mean difference in TTD between the adjusted and predicate bottle was calculated. For all microorganisms, the following criteria were used to assess equivalence: (i) for organisms with TTDs of $< 1 0$ hours in the predicate bottle, the mean difference in TTD should be $\leq 1$ hour; (ii) for organisms with TTDs ${ \tt > } 1 0$ hours in the predicate bottle, the mean difference should be within $10 \%$ of the predicate bottle TTD.

The overall TTD was 25.7 hours for the predicate bottle and 21.8 hours for the adjusted bottle, with an overall mean difference in TTD of 3.9 hours (Table 7a).

a Bottles where growth was not detected do not have TTD data, and were removed from analysis

The study demonstrated that the adjusted bottle performed equivalently when compared to the predicate bottle for all evaluated incolulum levels and blood volumes. The adjusted bottle was found to be equivalent to the predicate when read on either the BTA 3D or BTA VIRTUO Systems. TTD was not affected by the adjusted bottle lot.

When stratified by species, it was noted that the TTD for 38 of the 39 species evaluated in the adjusted FA Plus bottle, in the presence of blood, met the criteria for equivalency to the predicate bottle. In the presence of $4 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ blood, $H .$ influenzae and $H .$ . parainfluenzae had a mean TTD delay of 1.7 and 32.1 hours, respectively, in the adjusted bottle. A note in the adjusted FA Plus Package Insert states that $H .$ parainfluenzae is not always detected in the presence of blood, and was therefore found to be equivalent. In the presence of blood (4 and $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ ), faster TTD was achieved for $C .$ . glabrata, with a mean TTD improvement of ${ > } 3 0$ hours. Of note, the following species had a faster mean TTD when supplemented with $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ blood in the adjusted bottle: A. baumannii (5 hours), C. albicans (2.4 hours), $K .$ . aerogenes (2.8 hours), $E .$ . cloacae (5.7 hours), M. luteus (5.9 hours), $S .$ enterica (4.3 hours), $S .$ . flexneri (10.9 hours).

The TTD for 32 out of 34 species evaluated in the adjusted bottle, in the absence of blood, met the criteria for equivalency to the predicate bottle. In the absence of blood, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae had a mean TTD delay of 1.7 hours and 5 hours, respectively, when tested in the adjusted bottle. Of note, C. albicans and $C$ glabrata had a faster mean TTD of 3.6 hours and 36.6 hours, respectively, when tested in the adjusted bottle.
