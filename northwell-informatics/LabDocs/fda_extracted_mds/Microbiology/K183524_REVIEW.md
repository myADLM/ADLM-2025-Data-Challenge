# I. Device Description:

The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials combined with the nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with $0 . 4 5 \%$ to $0 . 5 0 \%$ saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System will automatically dilute the bacterial suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then the VITEK 2 will fill, seal and place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing, and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time (up to 24 hours for Streptococcus species). The analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based on attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the anti-microbial agent. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.

VITEK 2 AST-GN Delafloxacin has the following concentrations in the card: 0.06, 0.25, 0.5, and $2 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ ). The Delafloxacin MIC result ranges for the VITEK 2 are:

$\leq 0 . 0 6 - \geq 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ for Enterobacteriaceae $\leq 0 . 1 2 5 - \geq 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ for Pseudomonas aeruginosa

# L. Test Principle:

The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems uses visible light to directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells. Transmittance optics is based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Every 15 minutes throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based on the VITEK 2 card), light transmittance readings of each well measures organism growth by the amount of light that is prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of the incubation period, the MIC values and their associated interpretive category results for each antimicrobial on the test card are displayed in an automatically generated report.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A reproducibility study for the VITEK 2 AST-GN card with Delafloxacin was conducted at three external clinical sites using a panel of ten isolates of Gramnegative bacilli consistent with the indications for use. Testing was performed on three separate days and in triplicate for a total of 270 data points. The isolates tested in the reproducibility study included five Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumoniae, two $E .$ . cloacae, and three $P .$ . aeruginosa isolates. Inocula were prepared using both the auto-dilution and manual dilution methods for testing in the VITEK 2 System. In addition, inocula were prepared by the manual dilution method only for use with the VITEK 2 Compact. The mode MIC value was determined and the reproducibility was calculated based on MIC values that fell within $+ / -$ one doubling dilution from the mode MIC value. The majority of data points were on-scale and within $\pm$ one doubling dilution agreement as compared to the mode MIC. Two data points were off-scale when tested by the VITEK 2 and the VITEK 2 Compact. The data was analyzed taking into consideration best case and worst case scenarios as described in the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems. The reproducibility performance is shown in Table 2.

# Quality Control (QC) Testing

The CLSI recommended QC organisms (E. coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) were tested using both the VITEK 2 card and the reference method at each site. Both the automatic dilution and manual dilution methods were used for the VITEK 2 and the manual dilution method was used for the VITEK 2 Compact.

As shown in Table 3, both the auto-dilution and the manual dilution methods for VITEK 2 and the manual dilution for VITEK 2 Compact were within the expected range $59 5 \%$ of the time.

\* The lowest dilution of the VITEK 2 Delafloxacin MIC range is $\leq 0 . 0 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ for Enterobacteriaceae. Obtaining this value was considered an indicator that the quality control test results were acceptable. \*\*The lowest dilution of the VITEK 2 Delafloxacin MC range is $\leq 0 . 1 2 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ for $P$ . aeruginosa. Obtaining this value was considered an indicator that the quality control results were acceptable.

The CLSI Delafloxacin expected ranges for $E$ . coli ATCC 25922 and $P .$ . aeruginosa ATCC 27853 are $0 . 0 0 8 - 0 . 0 3$ and $0 . 1 2 - 0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ respectively. However, the VITEK 2 MIC reporting range is $\leq 0 . 0 6 - \geq 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ (MIC results: ${ \underline { { < 0 . 0 6 } } }$ , 0.12, 0.25, $0 . 5 , 1 , 2 , 2 4 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ for Enterobacteriaceae and $\leq 0 . 1 2 - \geq 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ (MIC results: $\leq 0 . 1 2 , 0 . 2 5 , 0 . 5 , 1 , 2 , \geq 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ ) for $P .$ . aeruginosa. The two recommended QC strains tested provided off-scale with the VITEK 2 card as the acceptable ranges are lower than the lowest concentration on the card $( 0 . 0 6 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ for Enterobacteriaceae and $0 . 1 2 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ for $P .$ . aeruginosa). The quality control test results were considered acceptable for both QC strains when the MIC value of $\leq 0 . 0 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ was obtained for $E .$ . coli ATCC 25922 and $\leq 0 . 1 2 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ for $P .$ . aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Given this, bioMérieux included the following footnote indicating that QC for delafloxacin is offscale:

VITEK 2 AST-GN Delafloxacin does not include the full CLSI/FDA recommended dilution range for QC testing with this organism.

However, during this study, all VITEK QC results for $P .$ . aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were either at 0.5 or $0 . 2 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ and none gave a value of $\leq 0 . 1 2 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ (See Table 3). In addition, bioMérieux includes the CLSI broth microdilution expected range in the labeling when the VITEK 2 system range is not aligned with that of the FDA/CLSI range. The additional information is acceptable.

# Inoculum Density Control

The DensiCHEK Plus was used to standardize the inoculum to a 0.5 McFarland standard. The instrument was standardized daily with all results recorded at each site. Calibration values were within the expected range.

# Purity Check

A purity check of all organisms was performed on the dilution tube used to prepare the VITEK 2 card inoculum. Only those cultures that were pure were evaluated in the study.

# Growth Failure Rate

There was one isolate that failed to grow in the VITEK 2 card in the clinical study. Complete test results were available for 403 isolates from a total of 404 clinical isolates. The growth failure rate was $0 . 2 5 \%$ and was acceptable.

A challenge set of 206 isolates was evaluated at one site. All 206 challenge organisms grew in the VITEK 2 GN card with Delafloxacin using both the auto-dilution and manual dilution methods for the VITEK 2 and manual inoculation for the VITEK 2 Compact System.

A total of 609 VITEK 2 AST results were available.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Testing of delafloxacin on the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card was performed at three external sites and on internal site using VITEK 2 Systems (PC) version 9.02. Results obtained with the bioMérieux VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card with Delafloxacin were compared to results obtained with the CLSI broth microdilution reference panel. The following concentrations of Delafloxacin are contained in the VITEK 2 AST-GN test card: 0.06, 0.25, 0.5, and $2 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ . However, the reporting range is $\leq 0 . 0 6 - \geq 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ for Enterobacteriaceae and $\leq 0 . 1 2 - \geq 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The reference panel contained two-fold serial dilutions with a range of $\leq 0 . 0 0 3 9$ to $2 1 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . The testing conditions for the reference method consisted of the following:

· Medium – Mueller Hinton broth with appropriate dilutions of antimicrobial solution added   
· Inoculum – Direct colony suspension   
· Incubation – $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ ambient air incubator; 16-20 hours

The VITEK 2 AST cards were inoculated with test organisms using the auto-dilution method (VITEK 2 System) and using the manual dilution method (VITEK 2 System and VITEK 2 Compact). All test inocula used for the VITEK 2 AST cards and the reference method were standardized using the DensiCHEK Plus instrument.

A total of 404 clinical isolates were evaluated at three sites with VITEK 2 AST – Gram Negative cards inoculated by automatic dilution and interpreted using the VITEK 2 instrument. There was one isolate that did not grow in the studies and was excluded from the study. The no growth rate was $0 . 2 5 \%$ (1/404). Most isolates were recently isolated from clinical specimen (270 isolates, $6 6 . 8 \%$ . The remainder were stock isolates (134 isolates, $3 3 . 2 \% \mathrm { ) }$ ). The clinical study included several species within Enterobacteriaceae that were not indicated in the FDA drug label for delafloxacin.

A total of 206 challenge organisms (147 Enterobacteriaceae and $5 9 P .$ . aeruginosa)

were evaluated at one site. The challenge set was tested with the auto-dilution and manual dilution options of the VITEK 2 System and with the manual dilution method on the VITEK 2 Compact System. Challenge isolates included $E$ . cloacae (18 isolates), $E .$ . coli (12 isolates), $K .$ . pneumoniae pneumoniae (14 isolates), $K .$ . pneumoniae (103 isolates), and $P$ . aeruginosa (59 isolates).

The combined data set of clinical and challenge isolates included 609 AST results (428 Enterobacteriaceae and $1 8 1 ~ P .$ . aeruginosa). A total of 289 $( 4 7 . 4 \% )$ resistant isolates were tested among the clinical $\mathrm { ( n { = } l } 3 0 $ ) and challenge $\mathrm { ( n = 1 5 9 }$ ) isolates. A sufficient number of resistant isolates from the indicated species were included.

The overall performance using the auto-dilution method of the VITEK 2 System demonstrated an EA of $9 8 . 0 \%$ and a CA of $9 5 . 9 \%$ . There were two major errors (2/291 susceptible isolates, $0 . 7 \%$ error rate) and 23 minor errors (23/609 total isolates, $3 . 7 \%$ error rate). The major error and minor error rates were acceptable. With Enterobacteriaceae isolates, performance was acceptable with an EA of $9 8 . 6 \%$ and a CA of $9 6 . 0 \%$ . With $P$ . aeruginosa isolates, performance was acceptable with an EA of $9 6 . 7 \%$ and a CA of $9 5 . 6 \%$ . The performance based on combined clinical and challenge data was acceptable. The overall performance is shown in Table 4. In addition, there was no significant difference in performance between indicated organisms only when compared to performance of all Enterobacteriaceae isolates tested (Tables 4.1 and 4.2).

To address testing of non-indicated species the sponsor included the following statement in the Precautions section of the device labeling:

Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the safety and efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested by this AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those found in the indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of susceptibility information in those instances is unknown.

EA – Essential Agreement $\pm 1$ dilution) Min – minor discrepancies CA – Category Agreement Maj – major discrepancies Eval – Evaluable isolates Vmj – very major discrepancies R – Resistant isolates

Essential agreement (EA) occurs when the result of the reference method and that of the VITEK card are within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are on scale for both the reference method and the VITEK card. Category agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation provided by the VITEK card.

# MIC Trends:

An analysis of trending was conducted using the combined clinical and challenge data for each organism group. This trending calculation considers MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or higher compared to the reference method regardless of whether the device MIC values are on-scale. Results that are not clearly at least one dilution lower, at least one dilution higher or in exact agreement with the CLSI reference method are not considered in the trending analysis.

Trending analysis results are shown in Table 8; results were stratified by species to assess species-related trends. Species for which the difference between the percentage of isolates with higher or lower readings was ${ \ge } 3 0 $ with a statistically significant confidence interval were considered to show evidence of trending. Trending that provides higher or lower MIC values compared to the reference method is addressed in labeling.

There was no trending noted for $P .$ . aeruginosa, however, when Enterobacteriaceae species were analyzed separately and combined, trends for higher MIC values compared to the reference were observed (Table 8). The following footnote was added to the performance table in the package insert to address trending:

MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or at least one doubling dilution higher when Enterobacteriaceae isolates compared to the reference microdilution.
