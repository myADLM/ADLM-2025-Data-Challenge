# 4. Device Description

The Vstrip® H.pylori Antigen Rapid Test (Vstrip®) is a Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) antigen rapid test. It is a lateral flow immunochromatographic assay which employs antibody-coated latex beads to detect $H .$ pylori antigens in stool specimens from patients suspected of H. pylori infection. This test is an in vitro diagnostic device to be used for the qualitative detection of $H .$ . pylori antigen in human stool samples, and test results are intended to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of $H .$ . pylori infection. This test utilizes a pair of $H .$ pylori-specific monoclonal antibodies that are capable of detecting H.pylori antigens in human stool. The assay kit includes a foil pouch containing test cassette which houses a strip incorporated with a pair of $H .$ pylori-specific monoclonal antibodies, sample preparation tubes that contain sample diluent buffer for dilution of stool samples with a sampler tool attached to the underside of the tube cap and a dispenser tool attached to the top of the tube, positive control reagent containing inactivated H.pylori, and the package insert and instructions. Each diagnostic strip is enclosed in a plastic frame with a window to display the results. To perform the test, a diluted stool sample which is first prepared by a sample preparation tube is added to the Test Cassette. If the sample contains H.pylori antigen, a pink-red test line (next to the letter T) along with a blue control line (next to the letter C) will be visible in the rectangle “Result Window”, as depicted in Figure 1. A blue control line is a line to show that adequate flow of the sample has occurred and active components have been employed during a test run. The presence of the blue line at the control position on the device confirms that the device is working properly. If $H .$ pylori antigen is absent or below the level of detection, no pink-red line will appear in the rectangle “Result Window” of the cassette next to the letter T, but a distinct blue line shows next to the letter C, as depicted in Figure 1. For invalid result, no visible blue line in the rectangle “Result Window” of the cassette next to the letter C, with or without a visually detectable pink-red line, as depicted in Figure 1. It may occur with the deteriorated materials, but an excess of stool sample and incorrect procedure is mostly the main reason for control line failure. When an invalid result appears, review the test procedure and re- test same specimen. If the test fails again, repeat the test with different specimens. If the problem persists, the use of concerned test kit lot should be discontinued.

# 5. Principle of the Test and Assay Procedures

Vstrip® H.pylori Antigen Rapid Test is a rapid immunochromatographic assay that utilizes a pair of

H. pylori-specific monoclonal antibodies to detect the presence of fecal $H .$ . pylori antigens indicated by a pink-red color line.

To perform the test, a diluted stool sample which is first prepared by a sample preparation tube is added to the Test Cassette and read the result at 10 minutes. All stool specimens and assay procedures must be handled at room temperature and on a flat surface.

# 6. Rationale of Antibody Selection and Information of Selective H. pylori Strains

In literature, the flagella part of H.pylori has been studied extensively and demonstrated the key role of their colonization in bacteria, inflammation, and immune evasion. Filament, a copolymer of the flagellin subunits, is an important subunit of H.pylori flagella and plays an important role in motility. As motility is essential for $H .$ pylori colonization in the human gastric mucosa, anti- H.pylori monoclonal antibody (Ab) against flagellin was utilized to develop Vstrip® H.pylori Antigen Rapid Test.

# 7. Intended Use

Vstrip® H.pylori Antigen Rapid Test is a single use immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative detection of $H .$ . pylori antigen in unpreserved human stool specimens. Test results are intended to aid in the initial diagnosis and treatment of $H .$ pylori infection. Test results should be taken into consideration by the physician in conjunction with the patient history and symptoms.

# 8. Indications of Use

# 10. Performance Data

# Comparison Study

A multi-center study including sites from USA and Taiwan was conducted to evaluate the performance of the study test device (Vstrip® H.pylori Antigen Rapid Test) for detecting $H .$ . pylori stool antigen (HpSA) in human stool from patients suspected of $H .$ pylori infection. Test results were compared to results from an FDA cleared $H .$ pylori stool antigen ELISA that was previously evaluated relative to the endoscopy biopsy composite reference method (i.e., culture, histology, and RUT) for initial $H .$ . pylori diagnosis with a demonstrated sensitivity and specificity greater than or equal to $9 5 \%$ and a lower bound of the two-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence interval (CI) greater than $89 \%$ .

A total of 333 fresh fecal specimens from the intended use population (150 fresh fecal samples collected in the USA and 183 fresh fecal samples collected in Taiwan) along with test device and comparator kits were provided by the Sponsor to the selected study laboratories. Trained laboratory operators were recruited for this study and were blinded to the samples designations.

Positive, negative and overall percent agreement were determined between Vstrip® H.pylori Antigen Rapid Test and the comparator ELISA in detecting the $H .$ pylori antigen in human stool. No invalid results were observed for the investigational test or the comparator ELISA. The Vstrip H.pylori Antigen Rapid Test demonstrated a positive percent agreement of $9 6 . 6 7 \%$ [58/60; $9 5 \%$ CI $8 8 . 6 4 \% - 9 9 . 0 8 \%$ and a negative percent agreement of $9 8 . 1 7 \%$ [268/273; $9 5 \%$ CI $9 5 . 7 9 \%$ - $9 9 . 2 2 \% ]$ with the comparator ELISA. The study acceptance criteria were met.

# Reproducibility Study

A study was conducted to evaluate the reproducibility of Vstrip® H.pylori Antigen Rapid Test results in detecting H.pylori antigen in human stool, as performed by different operators in multiple laboratories.

Five (5) panels of 12 frozen fecal samples each with random distributions of medium positive (4xLOD), low positive (1-2xLOD, near $\mathrm { C } _ { 9 5 }$ concentration), high negative (near $\mathrm { C } _ { 5 }$ concentration) and negative samples) were analyzed using the Vstrip® H.pylori Antigen Rapid Test by each operator at each site over five (5) days (one (1) panel per day per operator).

Across all sites and operators, agreement with the expected result was $9 7 . 8 \%$ (88/90) for the moderate positive panel member, $9 7 . 8 \%$ (88/90) for the low positive panel member, $9 8 . 9 \%$ (89/90) for the high negative panel member, and $100 \%$ (90/90) for the true negative panel member. The reproducibility study analyses demonstrated that results of the Vstrip® H.pylori Antigen Rapid Test are reproducible by different operators in multiple locations.

# Analytical Sensitivity

A study was done to establish the limit of detection (LOD) for the Vstrip® H.pylori Antigen Rapid test. The LOD testing was conducted in a stool matrix background comprised from three negative stool samples spiked with serial dilutions of two strains of cultured $H .$ pylori (ATCC 43504 and ATCC 51653). Each dilution was tested with the Vstrip ${ } ^ { \mathfrak { B } } \mathrm { H }$ .pylori Antigen Rapid test 10 times each by four operators (a total of 40 replicates). The LOD value for ${ \mathrm { V s t r i p } } ^ { \mathbb { P } } { \mathrm { \overline { { I } } } }$ H.pylori Antigen Rapid Test was defined as the concentration producing a positive result at least $9 5 \%$ of the time. The LOD value for Vstrip® H.pylori Antigen Rapid Test based on $9 5 \%$ positive results was $8 . 5 \mathrm { X } 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ for H.pylori strain ATCC 43504 and $1 . 9 \mathrm { X } 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ for H.pylori strain ATCC 51653.

# Inclusivity

An additional three $H .$ . pylori strains produced a positive result at least $9 5 \%$ of the time with the Vstrip® H.pylori Antigen Rapid Test when tested at the following concentrations: ATCC700392 $( 3 . 8 \mathrm { ~ \overset { \cdot } { x } ~ } 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { \overset { \cdot } { C F U / m L } } )$ ), ATCC 51110 $\left( 1 . 9 \mathrm { { x } 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { { C F U } / m L } } \right)$ , and BCRC 17132 $( 3 . 8 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L } )$ ).

# Analytical Specificity

A study was done to determine analytical specificity (cross reactivity) of the ${ \mathrm { V s t r i p } } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ H.pylori Antigen Rapid Test with panels of viruses and bacteria. The test was performed on positive and negative samples containing high levels of non-target microorganisms (bacteria spiked at ${ \geq } 1 \mathbf { x } 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ CFU/mL, viruses spiked at $\geq \mathrm { 1 x 1 0 ^ { 5 } \ T C I D _ { 5 0 } / m L } )$ . Testing included thirty seven (37) bacteria and seven (7) virus types. Various strains of viruses and bacteria panels were diluted and tested with the Vstrip® H.pylori Antigen Rapid Test to detect any potential cross-reactivity. Results were recorded at 10 minutes interval. Each condition was run in triplicate. None of the microorganisms tested produced false positive or false negative results.

# Interfering Substances

A study was conducted to determine if various over-the-counter medications or endogenous substances could interfere with the assay results. Fifteen potentially interfering substances were spiked in both positive and negative samples tested in triplicate with the Vstrip® H.pylori Antigen Rapid Test. None of substances with the indicated concentrations interfered with the performance of Vstrip® H.pylori Antigen Rapid Test.

# Sample Stability

Studies were conducted to examine the stability of stool samples when stored refrigerated at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ or frozen at $\boldsymbol { - 2 0 } ^ { \mathrm { o } } \ : \mathrm { C }$ . The study results supported the recommendations that stool samples can be stored up to seven days refrigerated at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ , up to 20 days frozen at $\mathrm { - 2 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ , and that samples can undergo up to three freeze/thaw cycles.

# Dose-Hook Effect Study

A dose hook effect (prozone) study was carried out to examine whether high concentrations of $H .$ . pylori antigen negatively affects the performance of the Vstrip®. The hook effect or the prozone effect is a type of interference which produces false negatives or inaccurately low results in the presence of high analyte concentrations. Five $H$ pylori strains were tested in triplicate at $1 0 ^ { 6 } – 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ CFU/mL (10 – 100X LoD) concentration range with the Vstrip® H.pylori Antigen Rapid Test. No dose hook effect was observed at the tested concentrations.

# 11. Conclusions

The conclusions drawn from the nonclinical and clinical studies demonstrate that the Vstrip® H.pylori Antigen Rapid Test is safe and effective and substantially equivalent to the predicate device in performance.
