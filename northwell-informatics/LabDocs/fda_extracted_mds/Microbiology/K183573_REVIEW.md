# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not applicable

# L. Test Principle:

To perform the test, a small portion of stool sample is diluted and mixed in the sample preparation tube, and the diluted sample is added to the test cassette. The sample flows through a labeled pad containing red-colored antibody-coated latex particles. If the sample contains $H .$ . pylori antigen, the antigen will bind to the antibody to form antigen-antibodylatex complexes which flow through the nitrocellulose membrane by capillary action. The complexes bind $H .$ pylori specific antibodies at the test line position to form a pink-red line. A blue line at the control line position serves as an internal control to show that adequate flow of the sample has occurred, and that active components have been employed during a test run. For a positive result, a pink-red test line (next to the letter T) along with a blue control line (next to the letter C) must be visible in the “Result Window”. If $H .$ . pylori antigen is not present or is present at very low levels in the stool sample, only a blue control line will be visible, and the test result is negative. If the blue control line does not develop within 10 minutes, the test result is invalid.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A reproducibility study was conducted at three laboratory sites in the US. Three lots of the Vstrip H. pylori Antigen Rapid Test were used. Two trained operators per site tested a coded and randomized sample panel once per day over five days. The panels consisted of 12 frozen samples contrived from pooled negative stool matrix spiked with known amounts of cultured $H .$ . pylori, and a true negative sample. Positive samples at different levels included three replicates each of medium positive (4X

LoD), low positive (1-2X LoD, near $\mathrm { C } _ { 9 5 }$ concentration expected to be positive approximately $9 5 \%$ of the time), high negative (near $C _ { 5 }$ concentration expected to be negative approximately $9 5 \%$ of the time). In total 90 data points were collected for each panel member. Across all sites and operators, agreement with the expected result was $9 7 . 8 \%$ (88/90) for the moderate positive panel member, $9 7 . 8 \%$ (88/90) for the low positive panel member, $9 8 . 9 \%$ (89/90) for the high negative panel member, and $100 \%$ (90/90) for the true negative panel member. The reproducibility study results were acceptable.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Controls:

Internal controls. Each test strip contains a blue internal control line to confirm correct sample flow and active reagents for the test run. If the blue control line is not visible, the result is invalid and the test should be repeated. The background color of the strip should be white and should not interfere with the reading of the test result. If the background strip color interferes with line reading, it is recommended to repeat the test.

External controls. The kit instructions recommend that external positive and negative controls should be tested with each new kit shipment. One vial of positive control reagent is provided with each test kit, and the kit sample diluent buffer serves as the negative control. The positive and negative controls are intended to ensure that the kit is functional to produce the expected results. The kit should not be used if either external control fails to deliver the correct test results.

External positive and negative controls were run during clinical and reproducibility studies, and all controls passed.

Sample stability:

Studies were conducted to examine the stability of stool samples when stored refrigerated at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or frozen at $\mathrm { - 2 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ . Negative stool samples and contrived positive samples were stored either refrigerated or frozen/thawed and tested over time with the Vstrip H. pylori Antigen Rapid Test. The positive samples consisted of $H .$ . pylori organisms spiked into negative stool matrix at moderate positive (5X LoD), low positive (1-2X LoD), and high negative (below 1X LoD) concentrations. The study results supported the recommendations that stool samples can be stored for up to seven days refrigerated at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , up to 20 days frozen at $\mathrm { - 2 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ , and can undergo up to three freeze/thaw cycles.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of detection (LoD) was determined using negative stool matrix spiked with serial dilutions of two strains of cultured $H .$ pylori (ATCC 43504 and ATCC 51653). The initial LoD was established by two operators testing at least ten replicates of each dilution. The initial LoD concentrations were confirmed by testing an additional 20 replicates at the target concentration by two additional operators. The LoD was defined as the lowest concentration at which $9 5 \%$ or more of the replicates were positive. An assay cutoff value was defined as the concentration that produced a $50 \%$ positive rate. The LoD was determined to be $8 \mathrm { { x } 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { { C F U } / m L } }$ for $H .$ pylori strain ATCC 43504 and $4 . 5 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ CFU/mL for $H .$ . pylori strain ATCC 51653.

Analytical inclusivity (reactivity):

In addition to the $H .$ pylori strains assessed in the LoD study, analytical inclusivity of the Vstrip H. pylori Antigen Rapid Test was also demonstrated with three additional strains. All strains were detected $100 \%$ of the time at the concentrations listed (Table 1).

# e. Analytical specificity:

# Cross reactivity:

The potential cross reactivity and microbial interference of the Vstrip H. pylori Antigen Rapid Test was assessed by testing high concentrations of non-target microorganisms in triplicate in the presence or absence of $H .$ . pylori (2-3X LoD) in negative stool matrix (Table 2). The non-target microorganisms were spiked into the samples at $\geq 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ for bacteria and at $\ge 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { T C I D } \varsigma _ { 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ for viruses. No false positive or false negative Vstrip H. pylori Antigen Rapid Test results were observed in the presence of the non-target microorganisms.

# Interfering substances

An interfering substances study was conducted to assess the potential interference of exogenous and exogenous substances on the performance of the Vstrip H. pylori Antigen Rapid Test (Table 3). High concentrations of the substances were tested in negative stool matrix in the presence or absence of H. pylori spiked at two to three times the LoD. The samples were tested in triplicate. No false positive or false negative Vstrip H. pylori Antigen Rapid Test results were observed for the substances at the concentrations tested.

# High-dose hook effect/prozone:

A high-dose hook effect (prozone) study was conducted to evaluate potential interference from high concentrations of $H .$ pylori antigen on test performance. Cultures of five $H .$ pylori strains were tested in triplicate at concentrations ranging from $1 0 ^ { 6 } - 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ CFU/mL (10 – 100X LoD). No false negative results suggestive of a high-dose hook effect were observed.

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The performance of the Vstrip H. pylori Antigen Rapid Test was evaluated in a multisite prospective clinical study. Three sites (one site in the US and two sites in Taiwan) used freshly collected, leftover stool samples from patients suspected of $H .$ . pylori infection and tested the samples with the Vstrip H. pylori Antigen Rapid Test.

The Vstrip H. pylori Antigen Rapid Test results were compared to results from an FDA cleared $H .$ pylori stool antigen ELISA. Performance of the FDA cleared comparator ELISA was previously established in comparison to an endoscopy biopsy composite reference method (i.e., culture, histology, and RUT) for initial $H .$ . pylori diagnosis with demonstrated sensitivity and specificity point estimates greater than or equal to $9 5 \%$ , and a lower bound of the two-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals (CI) greater than $89 \%$ for each. The performance of the Vstrip H. pylori Antigen Rapid Test was reported as positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) with the FDA cleared comparator ELISA results.

A total of 333 fresh stool samples were tested in the study (150 collected in the US and 183 collected in Taiwan). The study population was $70 \%$ (232) female, $30 \%$ (101) male, and the ages ranged from four to 86 years old (Table 4).
