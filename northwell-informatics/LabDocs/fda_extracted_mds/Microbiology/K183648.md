# 5.2 Device

Name of Device: APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module.

Common or usual name: APAS Independence.

Classification name: Automated image assessment system for microbial colonies on solid culture media (21 CFR 866.2190).

Regulatory Class: II (special controls).

Product Code: PPU.

# 5.3 Predicate Device

APAS Compact with Urine Analysis Module, DEN150059.

This predicate has not been subject to a design related recall.

No reference devices were used in this submission.

# 5.4 Device Description

APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module is a device designed to be used in a microbiology laboratory to automate the initial screening for the presence of growth on urine culture plates. It is an in vitro diagnostic device and has no direct contact with patients.

APAS Independence consists of an automated plate handling mechanism to move the plates through the instrument, an imaging station to capture an image of the culture plate, combined with software for analysis of the image, determination of growth and presentation of reports.

The APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module is intended to determine whether growth is present or not, and to provide a semi-quantitative assessment of the colony count (if present). This information will then be combined with other available clinical information to screen out biological samples without growth. All other plates will be presented to a microbiologist for examination, determination of status and further testing according to conventional laboratory practice. This enables the microbiologist to focus on plates with potentially significant growth, thereby reducing the time until results can be reported.

The APAS Independence is intended to have different software modules, each of which will provide an assessment of growth for specific clinical indications. This submission covers only the APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module. The APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module is indicated for screening of culture plates for assessment of urinary tract infections where the urine specimens are collected and 1μl is plated onto Blood and MacConkey Agars and incubated at $3 5 { \pm } 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 18 to 22 hours.

# 5.5 Intended Use

The APAS Independence is an in vitro diagnostic system comprised of an instrument and software analysis module(s) for specific indications that are used to automate imaging and interpretation of microbial colonies on plates of solid culture media.

# 5.6 Indications for Use

The APAS Independence is an in vitro diagnostic system comprised of an instrument for automated imaging of agar culture plates and a software analysis module for the following use:

The APAS Independence, when using its urine analysis module, automates urine culture plate imaging and interpretation to detect the presence or absence of microbial growth on sheep blood and MacConkey agar culture plates that are inoculated with a 1μL sample volume. The APAS Independence, when using its urine analysis module, provides a semi-quantitative assessment of colony counts that are used as an aid in the diagnosis of urinary tract infection. All urine culture plates that are identified as positive for growth by the APAS Independence, when using its urine analysis module, must be reviewed by a trained microbiologist.

# 5.7 Comparison of Technological Characteristics with the Predicate Device

The nominated predicate device is APAS Compact with Urine Analysis Module, which was cleared via de novo DEN150059.

APAS Independence adds automated plate handling to the existing functionality of automated plate interpretation within APAS Compact.

The two devices have the same Intended Use and same Indications for Use and use the same technology to provide an interpretation of growth from urine cultures as an aid in the diagnosis of urinary tract infection.

Both devices have been developed by Clever Culture Systems (CCS).

Table 5.2 below provides a side-by-side comparison of the main characteristics of the two devices.

# 5.8 Performance Data

The following performance data were provided in support of the substantial equivalence determination.

# 5.8.1 Safety and EMC

Electrical safety and EMC testing were conducted on the subject device, consisting of the instrument, carriers and qualification tools. The system complies with IEC 61010-1: 2010, IEC 61010-2-101: 2017 and UL 61010-1: 2012 for safety and IEC 61326-1: 2013, IEC 61326-2-6: 2013 and FCC Part 15B for EMC.

# 5.8.2 Software Verification and Validation

Software verification and validation testing were conducted, and documentation was provided as recommended by FDA’s Guidance for Industry and Staff, Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices. The software for this device was considered as a “moderate” level of concern as a malfunction of, or latent design flaw in the software could lead to an erroneous diagnosis or a delay in delivery of appropriate medical care that would likely lead to a Minor injury to the patient.

# 5.8.3 Clinical Studies

The predicate device, APAS Compact with Urine Analysis Module and the new device, APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module both utilize the same core APAS technology and the same urine analysis module to image culture plates and read and interpret growth.

Therefore, the clinical performance of the predicate device represents the clinical performance of the new device, APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module.

The results of three clinical studies (LBT001, LBT002 and LBT003) were submitted to support the de novo application DEN150059 and showed that APAS performed similarly to a microbiologist in reading and interpreting agar plates cultured for screening for uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI).

A confirmatory Method Comparison Study between the APAS Independence and APAS Compact was performed using 350 leftover clinical urine samples that were accepted for screening for UTI. 1µL of each urine sample was inoculated onto each of a pair of blood and MacConkey agar plates and incubated at $3 5 { \pm } 2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for $1 8 \mathsf { h r }$ . The plates were read by both APAS Compact and APAS Independence with the same urine analysis module and the results compared.

The APAS Compact and APAS Independence provided a screening result of the sample on each agar of either Positive, Review or Negative. A 3x3 confusion matrix is provided for blood and MacConkey agar in Table 5.3. and Table 5.4, respectively.

Table 5.3 shows that when APAS Compact reported a Positive result on blood agar, APAS Independence either agreed or returned a Review result. There were no cases where APAS Independence returned a Negative result and which therefore would not be looked at by a microbiologist. For those samples originally classified as Negative by APAS Compact, APAS Independence either agreed or assigned a Review and Positive designation which requires investigation by a microbiologist. The results indicate that on blood agar, there is a high level of agreement between APAS Independence and APAS Compact and that APAS Independence is slightly more likely than APAS Compact to assign a Positive or Review result (288 cases for APAS Independence compared with 272 cases for APAS Compact).

1 “Positive” and “Review” designations combined

The results for MacConkey agar in Table 5.4 follow a similar pattern. When APAS Compact reported a Positive result, APAS Independence agreed, with the exception of a single sample that was reported as Negative by APAS Independence. For those samples originally classified as Negative by APAS Compact, APAS Independence either agreed or assigned a Review and Positive designation which requires investigation by a microbiologist. The results indicate that on MacConkey agar, there is a high level of agreement between APAS Independence and APAS Compact and that APAS Independence is more likely than APAS Compact to assign a Positive or Review result (161 cases for APAS Independence compared with 139 cases for APAS Compact).

1 “Positive” and “Review” designations combined

The findings for plate designation are supported by comparative data for agreement of colony counts presented in Table 5.6 for blood agar and Table 5.7 for MacConkey agar, which demonstrate that for both agars, while overall there was a high level of agreement between the two systems, APAS Independence was more likely to overestimate than underestimate enumeration. This is acceptable because all plates with growth are subject to additional follow-up by a trained microbiologist and there is no increased risk to patients.

The test also compared colony morphology detection between paired sample plate images assessed by APAS Compact and APAS Independence. The results are presented in Table 5.7 for blood agar and Table 5.8 for MacConkey agar.

The results demonstrate a probability of ${ > } 9 5 \%$ detection across all colony types. In general, the APAS Independence is likely to overestimate some colony morphologies $( A C - / A l + > A C + / A l -$ .

# 5.8.4 Reproducibility & Precision

A study was performed using three APAS Independence instruments equipped with a Urine Analysis Module to show that the extent of variability in colony counts within and between these instruments is equivalent to that found with APAS Compact with Urine Analysis Module. The test was conducted using three dilutions of cultured organisms which were selected as being representative of those found in urine samples. The organisms used on blood agar were E. coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis. The organism used on MacConkey agar was E. coli. The test included blank plates inoculated with sterile saline. 1µL from a dilution of an organism representing $1 0 ^ { 3 } \mathsf { C F U / m L }$ , $1 0 ^ { 4 }$ CFU/mL or $1 0 ^ { 5 } { \mathsf { C F U / m L } }$ was inoculated onto one of 3 replicates per dilution and incubated for $3 5 \textdegree C \pm$ ${ } ^ { 2 \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for 18 hrs. Each culture plate was imaged five times at three different orientations within each of the three instruments and the resulting colony counts per plate were compared to determine the repeatability of colony count as a percent coefficient of variation $( \% C \backslash I )$ within an instrument, and reproducibility of colony count as a %CV across instruments. The results are shown in Table 5.9.

As noted with APAS Compact with Urine Analysis Module, the value for $\% 0 \%$ is inversely proportional to colony count. Overall, the reproducibility and precision of colony counts with the APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module was similar to that of observed with the APAS Compact with Urine Analysis Module and was therefore acceptable.

# 5.9 Conclusions

The predicate device, APAS Compact with Urine Analysis Module and the new device, APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module both utilize the same core APAS technology and the same urine analysis module to image culture plates and read and interpret growth.

The non-clinical data support the safety of the device and the hardware and software verification and validation demonstrate that the subject device should perform as intended in the specified use conditions. The equivalence study confirms that the two devices return the same clinical result. The results obtained with the new device also demonstrated acceptable reproducibility and precision.

Therefore, the data demonstrate that the subject device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
