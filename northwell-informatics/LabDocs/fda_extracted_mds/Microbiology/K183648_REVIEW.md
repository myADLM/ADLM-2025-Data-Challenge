# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

The performance of the APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module has not been evaluated with urine samples from pregnant women. The APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module will detect colonies of GBS if they are present but should not be used for primary screening for Group B Streptococcus (GBS) carriers. Follow recommended guidelines for identification of pregnant women who are colonized with GBS. 1

The performance of the APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module has not been evaluated with urine samples from suspected cases of complicated urinary tract infection e.g., those with underlying urinary tract pathology, suspected cases of persistent urinary tract infection, urine collected by invasive procedures or urine samples from immunocompromised subjects.

Slow growing organisms such as Corynebacterium spp. and Gardnerella vaginalis may not exhibit detectable growth within 18-22 hours. If infection with a slow growing species is suspected, extension of the incubation time may be required, followed by manual interpretation of the culture result. The APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module should not be used to interpret cultures incubated for greater than 22 hours.

The APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module is for use with the following culture plates manufactured by Remel: Tryptic Soy Sheep Blood Agar (R01202A) and MacConkey Agar with Crystal Violet (R01552A).

APAS Independence has been designed and validated for use only with whole plates. Bi-plates have not been evaluated and should not be used.

# B Principle of Operation:

The APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module is designed for the assessment of microbial colonies on urine culture plates. The instrument comprises an imaging station for capture of images of urine culture plates, a plate handling system that moves plates between the input carriers, imaging station and output carriers or stacks, together with software for analysis of the images, assessment and enumeration of microbial colonies (if present) and result designation. Plates with growth are designated as either “Positive” or “Review” depending on the number of colonies present and their morphologic characteristics. All plates that exhibit growth therefore require follow up according to standard laboratory practice by a trained microbiologist. Those plates that are designated by the APAS Independence to have no growth may be discarded without further review.

The APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module is indicated for screening paired sheep blood and MacConkey agar plates that are each inoculated with $1 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of urine and which are incubated at $3 5 \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 18 to 22 hours. The system takes digital images of each plate that are analyzed automatically to determine the number of colonies present and their associated morphologies. For each plate, the APAS Independence performs the following tasks:

a) Differentiates between areas of growth (colonies) and no growth (e.g., agar, labels, handwriting);   
b) Differentiates areas that are required for interpretation of colony morphology (e.g., α- and $\beta$ -hemolysis);   
c) Assigns to each area of growth a code that corresponds to a morphology type;   
d) Estimates the number of colonies present, converts this number to an organism concentration in the original urine sample and reports this value in terms of colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL).   
e) Generates a growth report including the sample and patient identifiers, type of growth present (if any), the colony count and any additional information pertaining to the patien that is obtained from the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS).

The colony morphologies reported by the APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module are shown in Table 2 for sheep blood agar and Table 3 for MacConkey agar. A “significant organism” at $\overline { { 1 0 ^ { 3 } \mathrm { C F U / m L } } }$ on the plate will trigger designation of that plate as “Positive,” as opposed to “Review.” Plates that are designated as “Positive” or “Review” are required to undergo further evaluation by a clinical microbiologist.

1. Instrument Name:

APAS Independence

2. Specimen Identification:

Plates are identified using an integrated barcode scanner within the Imaging Module of the APAS Independence. The identity of each plate is displayed on the results screen and transmitted automatically to the LIS.

# 3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The operator loads carriers containing culture plates into the Input Module of the APAS Independence from which they are moved automatically, one plate at a time, to the Imaging Module where the barcode is read, the lid is removed and images of the agar surface are captured. Upon completion of image capture and analysis, the plate lid is replaced and the system automatically sorts each plate based on its designation into the appropriate carrier in the Output Module.

4. Calibration:

The APAS Independence requires daily color calibration prior to use. Calibration is performed using the Color Calibration Tool provided with the instrument. Instructions for calibration are included in the APAS Independence User Manual.

# 5. Quality Control:

In addition to daily calibration, a System Check must be performed using the manufacturersupplied Part 1 and Part 2 plate tools prior to analysis of urine culture plates. If the System Check fails, the instrument should be locked to prevent processing of additional culture plates until has been service has been performed.

Instructions for daily Quality Control testing using reference culture plates inoculated with Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli are provided in the User Manual for the APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module. Both the appropriate colony morphology and colony count must be obtained for the results of the Quality Control testing to be considered acceptable.

In the event of a failure, Quality Control testing should be repeated. If the repeated failure occurs, the instrument should not be used until it has been serviced.

# A Analytical Performance:

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision and reproducibility of colony counts obtained with the APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module was evaluated with three different instruments using dilutions of representative uropathogenic bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis) grown on blood and MacConkey agar. Each dilution of organisms was plated in triplicate and incubated at $3 5 \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 18 hours. Plates from three dilutions that exhibited 0 to ${ \tt > } 1 0 0$ colonies plate were included in the study. Five images of each plate were captured on each APAS Independence instrument in each of three different orientations (0, 120 and $2 7 0 ^ { \circ }$ ). The mean, standard deviation and percent coefficient of variation of colony counts obtained for each organism dilution on each instrument and overall is presented in Tables $\underline { { \boldsymbol { 5 } } }$ and $\underline { { \mathbf { 6 } } } .$ , for blood and MacConkey agar respectively.

CFU: Colony Forming Units; $\% \mathrm { C V }$ : Percent Coefficient of variation; SD: Standard Deviation Note: No colonies were detected by any of the APAS Independence Instruments on MacConkey agar plates inoculated with saline (i.e., Mean CFU and $\mathrm { S D } = 0$ , in all cases).

Agreement between manual colony counts and those obtained with the predicate APAS Compact with Urine Analysis Module was demonstrated under DEN150059. Because the APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module uses the same hardware and software for image acquisition and analysis as the APAS Compact, additional testing to characterize the accuracy and linearity of colony counts was not needed. Please refer to the Decision Summary for DEN150059 for additional information.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

The analytical specificity of the predicate APAS Compact with Urine Analysis Module was demonstrated under DEN150059. Because the APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module uses the same hardware and software for image acquisition and analysis as the APAS Compact, additional testing to characterize the analytical specificity of the system was not needed. Please refer to the Decision Summary for DEN150059 for additional information.

4. Assay Reportable Range: Refer to Table 4 and to Section VII A(2).

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

The device labeling indicates that the APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module should not be used unless the system has passed the appropriate daily Quality Control (QC) checks. These include Color Calibration and a System Check using the optical tools that are provided with each instrument, as well as biological QC with standardized cultures of Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. Please refer to the Decision Summary for DEN150059 for information regarding the performance of the biological Quality Controls.

6. Detection Limit:

The limit of detection of the predicate APAS Compact with Urine Analysis Module was demonstrated under DEN150059. Because the APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module uses the same hardware and software for image acquisition and analysis as the APAS Compact, additional testing to characterize the analytical sensitivity of the system was not needed. Please refer to the Decision Summary for DEN150059 for additional information.

9. Carry-Over: Not applicable.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A Method Comparison Study was performed to demonstrate that the predicate APAS Compact (DEN150059) and APAS Independence exhibit similar performance with clinical specimens. In brief, residual clinical urine specimens that had originally been submitted for urinalysis, were inoculated onto bar code-labeled blood and MacConkey agar plates according to the instructions for use for the APAS Urine Analysis Module ( $1 \mu \mathrm { L }$ inoculum volume). The plates were incubated for 18 hours at $3 5 \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and images of each plate were then captured using one APAS Independence and one APAS Compact instrument system, each equipped with the Urine Analysis Module software. The images on each instrument were taken within 4 hours of completion of the specified incubation period.

A total of 550 urine specimens were initially enrolled in the study. Of these, the first 200 were excluded from the analysis of performance because the plate incubator exceeded the specified temperature. The results from the remaining 350 specimens were included in the analysis. A summary of the plate designations assigned by each instrument is shown on Table 7 and 8. In general, there was a high level of agreement $( \sim 9 9 \% )$ for plates designated as “Positive” by the two systems and there was a tendency for APAS Independence to designate more plates as “Positive” or “Review” than APAS Compact. This is also reflected in the tendency for higher colony counts to be reported by APAS Independence than by APAS Compact (Tables 9 and 10) and is considered acceptable without additional risk mitigation because both these designations require follow-up by a trained microbiologist.

Tables 11 and 12 show a comparison of the colony morphology designations assigned to each plate by the APAS Compact and APAS Independence using the Urine Analysis Module. Although the positive and negative agreement differed for each colony morphology, these designations are provided to the operator for informational purposes and are not used in disposition of the plates as “Positive”, “Review” or “Negative” and the performance was therefore determined to be acceptable without the need for additional risk mitigation.
