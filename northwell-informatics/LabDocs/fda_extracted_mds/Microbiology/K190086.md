Dear Tina Sobania:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR

803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice (https://www.fda.gov/medical  
devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance) and CDRH Learn   
(https://www.fda.gov/training-and-continuing-education/cdrh-learn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic. See the DICE website (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatoryassistance/contact-us-division-industry-and-consumer-education-dice) for more information or contact DICE by email (DICE@fda.hhs.gov) or phone (1-800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100).

# Predicate Device:

Cepheid Xpert® GBS LB Control Panel (K182472)

# Device Description:

The Cepheid Xpert® Respiratory Control Panel is used to monitor RNA extraction, amplification and detection of the Cepheid Xpert® Xpress Flu/RSV assay. The Cepheid Xpert® Respiratory Control Panel contains cultured viruses inactivated by chemical or radiological treatments. Each Cepheid Xpert® Respiratory Control Panel consists of 6 individually packaged positive control swabs and 6 individually wrapped negative control swabs. Each positive control swab contains Influenza A (H1N1) virus, Influenza A (H3N2) virus, Influenza B virus and Respiratory syncytial virus A. Each negative control swab contains Coxsackie B1 virus. Each swab is individually wrapped with a desiccant in a heat-sealed foil pouch.

# Device Intended Use:

The Cepheid Xpert® Respiratory Control Panel is intended for use as an external assayed positive and negative quality control to monitor the performance of in vitro laboratory nucleic acid testing procedures for the qualitative detection of Influenza A (H1N1) virus, Influenza A (H3N2) virus, Influenza B virus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus A performed with the Cepheid Xpert® Xpress Flu/RSV assay on the GeneXpert® Instrument System. The controls comprise cultured and inactivated Influenza A (H1N1) virus, Influenza A (H3N2) virus, Influenza B virus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus A as the positive control and Coxsackie virus B1 as the negative control.

The Cepheid Xpert ® Respiratory Control Panel is not intended to replace manufacturer controls provided with the device.
