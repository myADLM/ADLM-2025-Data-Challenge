# B. Device Name:

Formal/Trade Name:

Classification Name:

21 CFR 866.1640

Manual Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Systems Product Code: JWY

Common Name(s):

ETEST® Piperacillin/Tazobactam; ETEST® P/T

C. Predicate Device:

# D. Device Description:

$\mathrm { E T E S T ^ { \textregistered } }$ is a thin, inert and non-porous plastic strip carrying on one side the MIC reading scale in $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ , and on the other side a predefined antibiotic gradient.

When the strip is applied to an inoculated agar surface, the preformed antibiotic gradient immediately transfers into the agar matrix, then forming a stable, continuous and exponential gradient of antibiotic concentrations directly underneath the strip. Bacterial growth becomes visible during incubation, and a symmetrical inhibition ellipse centered along the strip appears. The MIC value is read from the scale in terms of $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ at complete inhibition of bacterial growth, where the pointed end of the ellipse intersects the strip.

ETEST $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Piperacillin/Tazobactam contains a range of piperacillin from 0.016 to $2 5 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ , overlaid with a fixed concentration of $4 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ of tazobactam.

# E. Intended Use:

ETEST® is a manual, quantitative technique for determination of antimicrobial susceptibility of non-fastidious Gram-negative and Gram-positive aerobic bacteria and fastidious bacteria. The system comprises a predefined antibiotic gradient which is used to determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC, in $\mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m L } )$ of different antimicrobial agents against microorganisms tested on agar media after overnight incubation.

Piperacillin/Tazobactam has been shown to be active against the Gram-negative aerobic microorganisms listed below according to the FDA label for this antimicrobial agent.

ETEST® P/T can be used to determine the MIC of Piperacillin/Tazobactam against the following microorganisms:

# Active both in vitro and in clinical infections:

Acinetobacter baumannii Escherichia coli Klebsiella pneumoniae Pseudomonas aeruginosa

In vitro data are available for the following microorganisms, but clinical significance is unknown:

Citrobacter koseri Morganella morganii Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Providencia stuartii Providencia rettgeri Salmonella enterica

# F. Performance Overview

ETEST® Piperacillin/Tazobactam demonstrated substantially equivalent performance when compared with the CLSI M07-A11 January 2018 broth microdilution reference method, following rules as defined in the FDA Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA, issued on August 28, 2009 and following specifications as defined in CLSI M100-S28 January 2018.

This Premarket Notification $( 5 1 0 [ \mathrm { k } ] )$ presents data in support of ETEST® Piperacillin/Tazobactam for Gram negative aerobic bacteria: Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. External evaluations were conducted with fresh and stock clinical isolates, as well as a set of challenge strains. The external evaluations were designed to establish the performance of $\mathrm { E T E S T ^ { \circled { 8 } } }$ Piperacillin/Tazobactam by comparing with the CLSI broth microdilution reference method.

ETEST® Piperacillin/Tazobactam demonstrated acceptable performance as presented in Table 1 below:

# Notes:

a) $\mathsf E \mathsf A = \%$ of MIC values within $\pm ~ 1$ dilution of the reference method.   
b) The performance data presented for Enterobacteriaceae include E. coli (168), K. pneumoniae (190), C. koseri (46), M. morganii (41), P. mirabilis (41), $P .$ vulgaris (31), S. marcescens (47), P. stuartii (36), P. rettgeri (28) and S. enterica (31).   
c) ETEST® Piperacillin/Tazobactam MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or at least one doubling dilution lower when testing Klebsiella pneumoniae compared to the CLSI reference broth microdilution method.   
d) Categorical errors when testing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were mostly due to minor errors $( 1 9 / 1 9 0 , 1 0 \% )$ . Two of 99 resistant isolates gave a very major error. Upon repeat testing, a reference MIC value could not be confidently established for one of the isolates due to extensive variability with the reference method.   
e) ETEST® Piperacillin/Tazobactam MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or at least one doubling dilution higher when testing A. baumannii, M. morganii, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii and S. marcescens compared to the CLSI reference broth microdilution method.   
f) Optional inoculator and ETEST® strip applicator can be used for plate inoculation and applying ETEST® strips onto agar media. In the ETEST® Piperacillin/Tazobactam clinical studies, swabs were used for plate inoculation/streaking and forceps were used for ETEST® strip application.

# LIMITATIONS

• The ability of ETEST® Piperacillin/Tazobactam to detect the following resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates is unknown because resistant isolates were either not available or an insufficient number was encountered at the time of comparative testing: Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Salmonella enterica.

Reproducibility and Quality Control demonstrated acceptable results.

# G. Conclusion:

The performance data presented in this submission support a substantial equivalence decision. ETEST® Piperacillin/Tazobactam (P/T) $( 0 . 0 1 6 / 4 { - } 2 5 6 / 4 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ is substantially equivalent to ETEST® Ceftazidime/Avibactam (CZA) $( 0 . 0 1 6 { - } 2 5 6 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ ) (K172150).
