# SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification OIR Review Summary

# 510(k) Number: K190204

This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the applicant’s own Class II devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:

1. The name and 510(k) number of the applicant’s previously cleared device:

Alere i Influenza A & B 2

510(k) number: K173932

2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or promotional materials (labeling changes are permitted as long as they do not affect the intended use).

3. Description of the device MODIFICATION(S):

The results interpretation in the Package Insert and QRI for dual positive influenza A and B results has been changed to simplify the follow up steps. This is a labeling update only, there have been no changes to the Intended Use or fundamental scientific technology of the ID NOW Influenza A & B 2 assay.

The ID NOW Influenza A & B 2 Product Insert has been changed to expand the Specimen Transport and Storage section to include instructions to allow freezing transport media specimens at $- 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ directly after collection.

To confirm assay performance will not be negatively impacted by storing VTM (viral transport media) specimens at $- 8 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ a Sample Freeze/Thaw study was performed. For this study negative nasal swabs were eluted in $3 \mathrm { m L }$ of VTM and pooled to generate a pooled negative clinical matrix. Positive samples were generated by spiking virus into the pooled negative clinical matrix, at LoD, $2 \mathbf { x }$ LoD and $1 0 \mathrm { x }$ LoD. The samples were tested before freezing and after each freeze/thaw cycle, with a total of 3 freeze/thaw cycles. All test results were expected (except one sample, which was correct upon re-testing). This data supports allowing specimen storage at $- 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ immediately after collection.

# B. Differences

The QRI and Package Insert have minor additions to expand specimen storage to allow for freezing specimens at $- 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and to simplify the follow-up directions for influenza A and B dual positive results.

The following text was added to the Specimen Transport and Storage section of the Package Insert: “Alternatively, the sample may be frozen at $- 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or colder immediately after collection.”

The results interpretation for Flu A Viral RNA Detected; Flu B Viral RNA Detected was modified to read: “Dual infections of Flu A and Flu B are rare. Repeat testing with a new specimen. If the result is still dual positive, repeat testing with another method before reporting results.”

Section 7 in the QRI was modified to address dual positive infections, it now reads: “Refer to Product Insert instructions for retest procedure in the case of a Dual Flu A and Flu B Positive or Invalid test result.”

# 5. Design Control Activities Summary:

A review of the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) was conducted and documented per Alere Scarborough, Inc. Quality System requirements. The modification made to the Product Insert does not affect the assay procedure and this change was not expected to impact the performance of the test or its safety and effectiveness. However, to confirm assay performance was not negatively impacted a Sample Freeze/Thaw study was performed and is described in section 3 above.

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the applicant’s description of the particular modifications and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
