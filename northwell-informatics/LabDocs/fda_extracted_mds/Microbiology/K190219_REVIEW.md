# I. Device Description:

The Simplexa VZV Direct assay is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system that enables the direct amplification and detection of VZV DNA from unprocessed cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) specimens without nucleic acid extraction. The system consists of the Simplexa VZV Direct, the Simplexa VZV Positive Control Pack, and the Direct Amplification Disc. The assay is performed on the LIAISON MDX instrument which is controlled by an external computer equipped with LIAISON MDX Studio Software.

The Direct Amplification Disk (DAD) consumable, disposable discs into which the PCR reagents and test samples are manually pipetted in, is compartmentalized into eight separate wedges and up to eight separate specimens or controls may be processed on each disc. The disc may be reused until all wedges have been utilized. Each wedge contains sample and reagent input wells, microfluidic channels and laser activated valves to control the fluid flow, and a reaction chamber.

In the Simplexa VZV Direct assay, fluorescent probes are used together with corresponding forward and reverse primers to amplify VZV and internal control targets. A well-conserved region of the VZV DNA polymerase gene is targeted to identify VZV DNA in the specimen. An internal control is used to detect PCR failure and/or inhibition.

The LIAISON MDX instrument is a rapid real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR thermocycler used for the identification of nucleic acid from biological specimens. The LIAISON MDX instrument automates amplification, fluorescence-based detection and result interpretation. The LIAISON MDX system was previously referred to as the 3M Integrated Cycler system which was previously cleared via the premarket notification under K102314. Results are reported as “Detected”, Not Detected”, “invalid” (due to failure of the Internal Control or inadequate sample volume) or with a specific error code and may be printed.

# L. Test Principle:

# 1. General Test Principle

The Simplexa VZV Direct assay is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system that enables the direct amplification and detection of VZV DNA from unprocessed cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) specimens without nucleic acid extraction. The system consists of the Simplexa VZV Direct assay, the Direct Amplification Disc(DAD) and the LIAISON MDX (with LIAISON MDX Studio Software).

In the Simplexa VZV Direct assay, fluorescent probes are used together with corresponding forward and reverse primers to amplify VZV and internal control targets. A well-conserved region of the VZV DNA polymerase gene is targeted to identify VZV DNA in the specimen. An internal control is used to detect PCR failure and/or inhibition.

The Simplexa VZV Direct assay uses the DAD consumable. The DAD consumable is compartmentalized into eight separate wedges and up to eight separate specimens or controls may be processed on each disc. The disc may be reused until all wedges have been utilized.

The Simplexa VZV Direct assay is performed by manually pipetting PCR reagents and test samples into the DAD. Each wedge contains sample and reagent input wells, microfluidic channels and laser activated valves to control the fluid flow,

![](images/ce25e574e7e9170e1b70fcaaa469a1ddab5ee9b03e72b264029d38364a664e1a.jpg)

and a reaction chamber. After loading the reagent and samples, the wells of the individual wedge are resealed with the original top foil and the tab is removed at the perforation. This disc is specifically designed to meter the amount of reagent (Reaction Mix) and sample that are placed into specific wells in the disc. After sealing the foil on each wedge, the DAD is loaded into the LIAISON MDX instrument and the run is initiated. The system uses a combination of centrifugal force and laser-controlled valves to combine metered aliquots of the unextracted samples and PCR reagents in the reaction/detection chamber of each wedge in the following manner:

Centrifugal force moves the fluid into the metering chambers. Excess reagent and sample are forced into the waste chambers by centrifugal force. At a specific point in the assay protocol the software triggers the laser to open the sample and reagent laser valves. This allows the fluid to pass from the sample and reagent metering wells into the reaction chamber.

After the centrifugal force has mixed sample and reagent within the reaction chamber, the amplification cycles begin. A sample is considered positive for a particular target if intensity of the optical reading crosses a particular threshold before a predetermined cut-off cycle.

# 2. Quality Control

Two controls should be run with this test:

a. Simplexa VZV Positive Control Pack may be used as an external control for Quality Control (QC) testing, training or proficiency testing. The Simplexa VZV Positive Control Pack comes with its own instruction for use.   
b. Negative/No Template Control (NTC) – not included in the kit

a Typical Ct values for the Positive Control range between 27-33. b Detection of the Simplexa DNA Internal Control (DNA IC) is not required for a valid result when VZV is detected.

# 3. Interpretation Of Results

Upon completion of the run, the software automatically calculates and displays results. For each accession ID (Sample ID) entered, the software displays a result (“Detected”, “Not Detected”, “Invalid”, “EC500, EC505 or EC515”) for VZV.

a. “Detected” result indicates the presence of varicella-zoster virus DNA in the patient sample.   
b. “Not Detected” result indicates the absence of varicella-zoster virus DNA in the patient sample.   
c. “Invalid” result indicates inability to conclusively determine presence or absence of varicella-zoster virus DNA in the patient sample. This result may be due to 1) Internal Control (IC) failure, or 2) failure to detect sufficient specimen volume. The sample needs to be retested. See “Invalid Results” section below.   
d. “EC500” Data processing error due to noise, weak or late amplification in the signal. Repeat the sample. If the problem persists, contact Technical Service.   
e. “EC505” Insufficient information to determine whether amplification was present. If the problem persists, contact Technical Service.   
f. “EC515” Internal control amplification is not within specification. Result is invalid, repeat the sample. If the problem persists, contact Technical Service.

The report can be printed and/or exported as needed.

Invalid Results: In case of an “Invalid” result, re-test the sample with a new Reaction Mix vial from the same kit or a new kit. If the problem is unresolved, contact DiaSorin Molecular Technical Services department.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: The reproducibility of the Simplexa VZV Direct assay between laboratories was evaluated in a study performed by two operators at each of three sites over a period of five days using a panel of 4 contrived samples and positive and negative controls (see below). On each day of testing each operator tested three replicates of each panel member (5 days x 3 sites x 2 operators x 3 replicates $= 9 0$ replicates per panel member). Table 5 below describes the reproducibility of all testing sites individually and combined and Table 6 below provides a quantitative summary of the reproducibility based on the CT values achieved for the reproducibility of the panel members. The following covariates were calculated: Between site, between day, between instrument, between run, and within run viability.

Each of the laboratories tested the following panel of six samples:

1. Simplexa VZV Direct Positive Control (PC)   
2. Negative/No Template Control (NTC)

3. Four contrived sample pools prepared by spiking a specific concentration of the VZV strain into CSF with the following VZV strains and concentrations:

• A low positive close to LoD for strain VZV 9939 • A medium positive for strain VZV 9939 • A low positive close to LoD for strain VZV Ellen A medium positive for strain VZV Ellen.

# Inter Lot Precision – Reaction Mix

The inter-lot variability of the Simplexa VZV Direct Reaction Mix was assessed with two instruments and three lots of reagents at Diasorin’s internal site. The panel members were the same in concentration and formulation as the ones used in the reproducibility study above. Testing was performed across three non-consecutive days with 1 run for each instrument and lot per day (each by a different operator). The design: 2 instruments X 3 Lots X 2 runs/Day X 3 days $= 3 6$ replicates per panel member.

# Inter-lot Precision- Simplexa Positive Control

The Inter-lot precision study was performed at DiaSorin’s internal site. Three Simplexa VZV Direct Positive Control (PC) lots were used to evaluate inter-lot precision by performing a total of six runs across three non-consecutive days, two runs per day by a single operator using a single LIAISON MDX instrument and single lot of Simplexa VZV Direct Reaction Mix lot. Each run included at least two replicates per Simplexa VZV Direct Positive Control lot.The results of this study are summarized in Table 9 below.

\* One IC Ct value was excluded from the statistical analysis of the internal control, since the IC is not required if valid amplification is observed in the FAM channel.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable because the Assay is qualitative.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Stability study: The data support a shelf-life claim of 12 months for the Simplexa VZV Direct and the Simplexa VZV Positive Control Pack.

# d. Cut-Off

Samples tested with the Simplexa VZV Direct assay are produce one of the following results Positive, Negative or Invalid based on the comparison of Cycle Threshold (Ct) values observed in the optical channels for VZV and the Internal Control targets to previously determined cut-offs. The Ct cut-offs were established during development of the assay and validated in the analytical and clinical study described in this Decision Summary.

e. Detection Limit:

The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined for the Simplexa VZV Direct assay using quantified stocks of two VZV strains (Ellen and 9939) serially diluted into negative human CSF Dilutions were tested with a total of 32 replicates using 2 lots and 8 instruments across 4 non-consecutive days. The LoD was determined to be the lowest concentration that could be detected positive $> 9 5 \%$ of the time (see Table 10 below).

# f. Analytical Reactivity:

The Simplexa VZV Direct assay was evaluated for analytical reactivity (inclusivity) to five (5) VZV strains (VZV 82, VZV 275, VZV 1700, VZV Isolate A and VZV Isolate B) in CSF. The study was performed with a single lot of Simplexa VZV Direct Reaction Mix and Simplexa VZV Direct Positive Control. The study was conducted over the course of two (2) non-consecutive days. Each titered strain was diluted into negative CSF at a concentration of $2 . 0 \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ . Results are included in Table 11 below. An additional 178 strains of VZV were evaluated by in silico analysis (BLAST). All of these showed $100 \%$ homology, with the exception of Genbank KU52949. For Genbank KU52949, there was a $9 9 \%$ homology, with one mismatch in the Taqman probe region. This mismatch is not expected to negatively impact the detection of this strain.

# g. Analytical Specificity:

# Cross-Reactivity

The Simplexa VZV Direct assay was evaluated for cross reactivity by testing 105 different bacteria, viruses and fungi which represent closely related organisms or cause similar clinical symptoms. All samples were prepared by spiking each potentially cross reacting organism into VZV negative pooled human CSF. For potentially cross reacting bacteria or fungi, the testing concentration was $1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ CFU/mL; for viruses testing was performed at $1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ T $\mathrm { \dot { C } I D 5 0 / m L }$ . No cross reactivity was observed for the tested organisms at the test concentration indicated in Table 12 below.

# Competitive Interferences

The Simplexa VZV Direct was evaluated for microbial inhibition (or competitive interference by other microorganisms) by testing the same 105 different bacteria, viruses and fungi that were tested for cross reactivity.

All samples were prepared by spiking each potentially inhibiting organism into a baseline consisting of either the Ellen or 9939 strains of VZV at a concentration of $1 - 2 \mathbf { x }$ LoD in VZV- negative human CSF. For potentially inhibiting bacteria or fungi, the testing concentration was $1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ ; for viruses the testing concentration was $\mathrm { 1 x 1 0 ^ { 5 } T C I D 5 0 / m L }$ . For organisms not titered in $\mathrm { C F U / m L }$ or $\mathrm { T C I D } 5 0 / \mathrm { m L }$ , other industry acceptable units were used. Results are included in the last column of Table $1 2 ~ \mathrm { N o }$ microbial interference was observed for the tested organisms at the test concentration indicated in Table 12 below

# Interfering substances

The Simplexa VZV Direct assay was evaluated for the effects of sixteen potentially interfering endogenous and exogenous substances.

All samples were prepared by spiking each potentially interfering substance into a baseline sample consisting of either of the two VZV strains (Ellen or 9939) at a level of $2 \mathbf { x }$ limit of detection (LoD), in pooled human CSF matrix. Each interferent was spiked into the baseline sample and tested in triplicate at the concentration listed in the Table 13 below.

# Carry -Over/Cross-contamination Study

A study to assess the potential for carry-over/cross-contamination was conducted in support of the Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct assay (K120413). The study design was determined to be acceptable and no evidence of contamination was observed. Because of the similarities in format and assay workflow with this previously cleared device, no additional contamination studies were conducted with the Simplexa VZV Direct assay in support of this $5 1 0 \mathrm { k }$ .

# Sample storage and handling - Fresh versus Frozen

The Sample Storage and Handling - Fresh Vs. Frozen Study was performed using contrived samples in CSF. For each strain (Ellen and 9939), 70 samples were contrived at various concentrations ranging from 2x LoD up to $5 0 \mathrm { x } \mathrm { L o D }$ as indicated in the Table 14 (VZV Ellen strain) and Table 15 (VZV 9939 strain) below. Samples were tested fresh (Column “Fresh”) and then transferred to refridgerated storage at 2- $8 \ : ^ { \mathrm { \circ } } \mathrm { C }$ for 72 hours. Subsequent to testing (Column “Refridgerated”) samples were then transferred to the $\mathrm { - 7 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ freezer where they were stored for 30 days. Samples were tested after a total of three freeze/Thaw cycles (Column “Frozen (including 3 Freeze Thaw Cycles)”.

Clinical Agreement:

A total of 724 remnant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients suspected of VZV infection of the central nervous system (CNS) were obtained from prospective and prospectively banked collections from eight collection sites during the Simplexa VZV Direct clinical study. Sites that prospectively collected samples $( \mathrm { n } \mathrm { = } 1 0 )$ ) performed testing of the samples directly and then shipped an aliquot of the sample to Diasorin Molecular for comparator testing. For the banked samples DiaSorin Molecular aliquoted and distributed the samples for Simplexa VZV Direct testing and the comparator testing.

Of the 724 total samples 637 clinical samples were included in the analysis based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study. A total of 87 samples were excluded from the analysis for not having sufficient volume, for not generating a final comparator result, for not meeting the inclusion criteria, and for exceeding sample storage.

Simplexa VZV Direct results were compared to results from a composite reference method. The composite reference method consisted of two validated real-time PCR assays followed by confirmation of positive PCR amplification products with bidirectional sequencing. Samples were characterized as positive if one or both PCR assays were positive and confirmed by bi-directional sequencing. Samples were characterized as negative if both PCR assays were negative. All composite reference method testing was performed at DiaSorin Molecular. Table 16 below shows the Clinical Agreement of the Simplexa VZV Direct as compared to the composite reference method.

a One of two discordant results was positive with an alternate NAAT used by the collection site during routine testing.

Due to the low prevalence of VZV infection in CSF samples, contrived positive samples were tested to supplement the number of positive samples tested. For each of the two strains, VZV Ellen and VZV 9939, 60 samples were contrived across the clinical range of the Simplexa VZV Direct assay with $60 \%$ of the samples contrived as low positive samples close to the LoD of the test. Samples were tested at seven clinical sites in a blinded manner and randomized with VZV negative samples. The samples were stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 7 days post collection and at $\mathrm { < - 7 0 \mathrm { ~ } ^ { \circ } C }$ thereafter. Simplexa VZV Direct test results for contrived samples were compared to the same Composite Reference Method described for the prospective clinical study above. The contrived sample study demonstrated a positive percent agreement of $100 \%$ (120/120) with a $9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval of $9 6 . 9 \substack { - 1 0 0 . 0 \% }$ . The results of the Clinical Study stratified by the age of the subjects is shown in Table 17.
