Device Name CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel: Influenza A/B Typing Kit, Influenza A Subtyping Kit (VER 2), Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Kit (VER 1.1 and VER 2), and Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit (VER 3)

Indications for Use (Describe) CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel - Influenza A/B Typing Kit:

The Influenza A/B Typing Kit contains reagents and controls of the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel and is intended for use in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays on an in vitro diagnostic real-time PCR instrument that has been FDA-cleared for use with this kit in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information:

• For qualitative detection of influenza virus type A or B viral RNA in upper respiratory tract clinical specimens (including nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS], nasal swabs [NS], throat swabs [TS], nasal aspirates [NA], nasal washes [NW] and dual nasopharyngeal/throat swabs [NPS/TS]) and lower respiratory tract specimens (including bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL], bronchial wash [BW], tracheal aspirate [TA], sputum, and lung tissue) from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture;

• To provide epidemiologic information for surveillance of circulating influenza viruses.

Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a season when seasonal influenza viruses A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation and during a season when the A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus was the predominant influenza A virus in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary with other emerging influenza A viruses.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted unless a BSL 3E facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

All users, analysts, and any person reporting results from use of this device should be trained to perform and interpret the results from this procedure by a competent instructor prior to use. CDC Influenza Division will limit the distribution of this device to only those users who have successfully completed a training course provided by CDC instructors or designees.

PCR instrument that has been FDA-cleared for use with this kit in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information:

• For the presumptive identification of virus in patients who may be infected with influenza A subtype A(H5) (Asian lineage) from viral RNA in human respiratory specimens and viral culture in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors;

• To provide epidemiologic information for surveillance of circulating influenza viruses.

Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a season when seasonal influenza viruses A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation and during a season when the A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus was the predominant influenza A virus in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary with other emerging influenza A viruses.

Testing with the influenza H5a and H5b primer and probe sets should not be performed unless the patient meets the most current U.S.Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) clinical and epidemiologic criteria for testing suspect A(H5) specimens. The definitive identification of influenza A(H5) (Asian lineage) either directly from patient specimens or from virus cultures requires additional laboratory testing, along with clinical and epidemiological assessment in consultation with national influenza surveillance experts.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted unless a BSL 3E facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

The CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is used in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays on an in vitro diagnostic real-time PCR system. The panel is configured in four separate kits. Each kit consists of oligonucleotide primers, fluorescently labeled hydrolysis probes, and controls which are used in rRT-PCR assays for the in vitro qualitative detection and characterization of influenza virus RNA in respiratory specimens from patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI). Oligonucleotide primers and probes for detection of influenza A, influenza B, and 2009 influenza A (swine origin) were selected from highly conserved regions of the matrix (M), non-structural (NS), and nucleoprotein (NP) genes, respectively. Oligonucleotide primers and probes for characterization and differentiation of influenza A(H3) and A(H1)pdm09 viruses and genetic lineages of influenza B were selected from highly conserved regions of their HA genes. Oligonucleotide primers and probes to detect the human RNase P gene (RP) in control samples and clinical specimens is also included in the panel.

# VIII. ANALYTICAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

Analytical Sensitivity - Limit of Detection (LOD) Equivalency Study

The LOD equivalency between the FDA-cleared CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel using the Applied Biosystems™ 7500 Fast Dx and either the Applied Biosystems™ QuantStudio™ Dx (QSDx) or the QIAGEN Rotor-Gene Q MDx (QMDx) instrument was evaluated by testing 5-fold serial dilutions of characterized influenza viruses of known egg infectious dose $50 \%$ titer. Virus dilutions were prepared using a suspension of betapropiolactone (BPL) treated A549 cells in viral transport medium (VTM) as diluent. Triplicate samples of each dilution were extracted separately with the Roche MagNA Pure Compact RNA Isolation Kit. Each assay of the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel was performed using Invitrogen SuperScript™ III Platinum $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ One-Step RT-PCR System (SuperScript) and Quanta qScript™ (qScript) enzyme systems. The acceptance criterion for LOD equivalence between the cleared Applied Biosystems™ 7500 Fast Dx and the investigational Applied Biosystems™ QSDx or the QIAGEN QMDx instrument was defined as a demonstration of $100 \%$ positivity (3 out of 3 replicates) at either the same endpoint concentration or within one 5-fold dilution. The results of the study are summarized by the virus tested in Tables 8-5 to 8-15. The lowest concentration at which each assay showed $100 \%$ positivity is highlighted. Each investigational instrument met the acceptance criterion when compared to the cleared instrument.

# Analytical Precision – Reproducibility

Studies were performed to assess the reproducibility of the QIAGEN QMDx and Applied Biosystems™ QSDx instruments with the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. A blinded panel of contrived influenza A and influenza B samples containing a background of BPL-treated A549 cells in VTM was assembled by adding a BPL-treated influenza A(H3N2) virus, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, or an influenza B/Victoria virus, B/Nevada/03/2011, respectively. The samples included a moderate positive sample and a low positive sample near the established assay LOD as well as a negative sample consisting of background A549 cells and VTM. Three separate testing sites were selected for testing each PCR instrument. Testing was performed by two different analysts at each site over five different days. Analysts extracted nucleic acid from the contrived samples and performed rRTPCR with the InfA, H3, pdmInfA, pdmH1, InfB, YAM, VIC and RP assays from the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel using Invitrogen SuperScript enzyme. The results for the reproducibility study are summarized in Tables 8-16 and 8-17. Both instruments demonstrated high reproducibility with $\geq 9 3 . 3 \%$ agreement across different sites, analysts, and days.

# Carryover and Cross-contamination Study

The potential for carryover and cross-contamination when testing samples of high viral RNA concentration using either the QIAGEN QMDx or Applied Biosystems™ QSDx instruments with the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel was examined. An alternating pattern of high positive and negative contrived samples was analyzed using the InfA, H5a, H5b, and RP assays from the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. Contrived samples were prepared using characterized stocks of BPL-inactivated influenza A/gyrfalcon/41088-6/2014 PR8-IDCDC-RG43A (H5N8) in a suspension of A549 cells. A total of 5 individual runs were performed on each instrument. The percent agreement with the expected result was calculated to determine any carryover and crosscontamination effect. The results for each instrument are summarized in Tables 8-18 and 8-19. No carryover or cross–contamination effect was seen with either instrument.

# IX. CLINICAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

The clinical performance of the Applied Biosystems™ QSDx and QIAGEN Rotor-Gene Q MDx instruments was evaluated to demonstrate equivalency with the FDA-cleared Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx when using the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time Diagnostic Panel. The study was performed using retrospective clinical specimens collected during the 2013-2014 influenza seasons. The lack of available clinical specimens containing influenza A(H5) viruses was addressed using ten contrived samples prepared with BPL-inactivated influenza A(H5) virus in a suspension of human A549 cells and virus transport medium. A total of 50 clinical specimens and contrived samples that were previously determined to be positive using the Applied Biosystems™ 7500 Fast Dx for influenza A(H1)pdm09, A(H3), A(H5), B/Victoria, or B/Yamagata virus and 50 negative specimens were evaluated with the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time Diagnostic Panel. Samples were extracted using the Roche MagNA Pure Compact and RNA Isolation Kit. Testing was performed using Invitrogen SuperScript enzyme mastermix and utilizing either the Applied Biosystems™ QSDx or QIAGEN QMDx. The results are summarized in the Tables 8-20 to 8-21. Each instrument demonstrated $100 \%$ agreement with the comparator.

# X. CONCLUSION

Performance studies were conducted to evaluate the modification of the CDC Human Influenza Virus rRT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to add real-time PCR instrument options that are acceptable for use with the CDC device. Evaluation of the LOD equivalency, reproducibility, carryover and crosscontamination, and testing of clinical samples demonstrated that the modified device is substantially equivalent to the predicate.
