# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

# CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel - Influenza A/B Typing Kit:

The Influenza A/B Typing Kit contains reagents and controls of the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel and is intended for use in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays on an in vitro diagnostic realtime PCR instrument that has been FDA-cleared for use with this kit in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information:

For qualitative detection of influenza virus type A or B viral RNA in upper respiratory tract clinical specimens (including nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS], nasal swabs [NS], throat swabs [TS], nasal aspirates [NA], nasal washes [NW] and dual nasopharyngeal/throat swabs [NPS/TS]) and lower respiratory tract specimens (including bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL], bronchial wash [BW], tracheal aspirate [TA], sputum, and lung tissue) from human patients with signs and symptoms of

respiratory infection and/or from viral culture;

To provide epidemiologic information for surveillance of circulating influenza viruses.

Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a season when seasonal influenza viruses A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation and during a season when the $\mathrm { A ( H 1 N 1 ) p d m } 0 9$ influenza virus was the predominant influenza A virus in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary with other emerging influenza A viruses.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted unless a BSL 3E facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

All users, analysts, and any person reporting results from use of this device should be trained to perform and interpret the results from this procedure by a competent instructor prior to use. CDC Influenza Division will limit the distribution of this device to only those users who have successfully completed a training course provided by CDC instructors or designees.

# CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel - Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Kit (VER 1.1 and VER 2):

The Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Kit contains reagents and controls of the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel and is intended for use in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays on an in vitro diagnostic real-time PCR instrument that has been FDA-cleared for use with this kit in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information:

For the determination of the genetic lineage of human influenza B viruses as B/Victoria or B/Yamagata lineage from viral RNA in upper respiratory tract clinical specimens (including nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS], nasal swabs [NS], throat swabs [TS], nasal aspirates [NA], nasal washes [NW] and dual nasopharyngeal/throat swabs [NPS/TS]) from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture;

To provide epidemiologic information for surveillance of circulating influenza viruses.

Performance characteristics for influenza B lineage genotyping were established during a season when influenza B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages were in circulation.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.

All users, analysts, and any person reporting results from use of this device should be trained to perform and interpret the results from this procedure by a competent instructor prior to use.

# CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel - Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit (VER 3):

The Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit contains reagents and controls of the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel and is intended for use in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays on an in vitro diagnostic real-time PCR instrument that has been FDA-cleared for use with this kit in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information:

For the presumptive identification of virus in patients who may be   
infected with influenza A subtype A(H5) (Asian lineage) from viral RNA in human respiratory specimens and viral culture in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors;   
To provide epidemiologic information for surveillance of circulating influenza viruses.

Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a season when seasonal influenza viruses A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) were the predominant influenza

A viruses in circulation and during a season when the A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus was the predominant influenza A virus in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary with other emerging influenza A viruses.

Testing with the influenza H5a and H5b primer and probe sets should not be performed unless the patient meets the most current U.S.Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) clinical and epidemiologic criteria for testing suspect A(H5) specimens. The definitive identification of influenza A(H5) (Asian lineage) either directly from patient specimens or from virus cultures requires additional laboratory testing, along with clinical and epidemiological assessment in consultation with national influenza surveillance experts.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted unless a BSL 3E facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

NA

# L. Test Principle:

The CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel includes sets of oligonucleotide primers and dual-labeled hydrolysis probes to be used in real-time RT-PCR assays on in vitro diagnostic real-time PCR instrument that has been FDA-cleared for use with this device. The targeted regions of influenza viral RNA are transcribed into complimentary DNA (cDNA) and amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The fluorescently

labeled probes anneal to amplified DNA fragments and the fluorescent signal intensity is monitored by the real-time PCR instrument during each PCR cycle. Amplification of target is recorded as increase of fluorescence over time in comparison to background signal.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Studies were conducted to assess the reproducibility of the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio Dx (QSDS) and the QIAGEN Rotor-Gene Q MDx (QMDX) with the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel.

A blinded panel of contrived influenza A and influenza B samples containing a background of beta-propiolactone (BPL) treated A549 cells in viral transport medium (VTM) was assembled by adding a BPL treated influenza A(H3N2) virus, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, or an influenza B/Victoria virus, B/Nevada/03/2011, respectively. The samples included a moderate positive sample, a low positive sample near the established assay LoD, and a negative sample consisting of background A549 cells and VTM.

Three separate testing sites were selected for each real-time PCR instrument platform. The contrived sample panel was tested five times by each of the two analysts at each site over five days. Analysts extracted nucleic acid from the contrived samples using a nucleic acid extraction method that has been FDAcleared for use with this device and performed rRT-PCR with the InfA, H3, pdmInfA, pdmH1, InfB, YAM, VIC and RP assays from the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel using Invitrogen SuperScript enzyme.

The LoD performance equivalency between the FDA-cleared CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx and either the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio Dx (QSDx) or QIAGEN Rotor-Gene Q MDx (QMDx) instrumentwas was evaluated by testing 5-fold serial dilutions of the following five characterized influenza viruses of known egginfectious dose $50 \%$ titer: Influenza A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (A/H3N2), Influenza A/Michigan/45/2015 (A/H1N1pdm09), Influenza B/Montana/05/2012 (B/Victoria), Influenza B/Massachusetts/02/2012 (B/Yamagata), and Influenza A/gyrfalcon/Washington/41088-6/2014 PR8-IDCDC-RG43A (A/H5N8).

Virus dilutions were prepared using a suspension of beta-propiolactone (BPL) treated A549 cells in viral transport medium (VTM) as diluent. Triplicate samples of each dilution were extracted separately with the Roche MagNA Pure Compact RNA Isolation Kit. Each assay of the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel was performed using both theInvitrogen SuperScript III Platinum One-Step RT-PCR System (SuperScript) and the QuantaqScript (qScript) enzyme system. The acceptance criterion for LoD equivalence between the FDA-cleared Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx and the investigational Applied Biosystems QSDx or QIAGEN QMDx instrument was pre-defined as a demonstration of $100 \%$ positivity (3 out of 3 replicates) at either the same endpoint concentration or within one 5-fold dilution. The results of the study are summarized by the virus strain tested in Tables 3 to 12 below. The lowest concentration at which each assay showed $100 \%$ positivity is highlighted green.

f. Assay cut-off:

Not applicable, aspects of the tests other than real-time PCR instrument platform and nucleic acid extraction options are not modified from the previously FDA-cleared versions.

# g. Carryover and Cross-contamination:

The potential for carryover and cross-contamination when testing samples of high viral RNA concentration using either the QIAGEN QMDx or Applied Biosystems QSDx instruments with the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel was examined. An alternating pattern of high positive and negative contrived samples was analyzed using the InfA, H5a, H5b, and RP assays from the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. Contrived samples were prepared using characterized stocks of BPL-inactivated influenza A/gyrfalcon/41088- 6/2014 PR8-IDCDC-RG43A (H5N8) in a suspension of A549 cells. A total of five individual runs were performed on each instrument. The percent agreements with the expected result were calculated to determine any carryover and cross-contamination effect. No carryover or cross–contamination effect was observed with either real-time PCR instrument during this study.

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

Performance testing clinical specimens using the Applied Biosystems QSDx and the QIAGEN Rotor-Gene Q MDx instrument platforms with the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel test kits was evaluated to demonstrate equivalency with the FDA-cleared Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx. The study was performed using retrospective natural clinical specimens collected during the 2013-2014 influenza seasons. The lack of available natural clinical specimens containing influenza A(H5) viruses was addressed using ten contrived samples prepared with BPL-inactivated influenza A(H5) virus in a suspension of human A549 cells and virus transport medium. A total of 50 natural clinical specimens and contrived samples that were previously determined to be positive using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx (the comparator) for influenza A/H1pdm09 (10 specimens), A/H3 (10 specimens), A/H5 (10 specimens), B/Victoria (10 specimens), or B/Yamagata (10 specimens) and 50 influenza negative natural clinical specimens were evaluated using the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time

Diagnostic Panel. Samples were extracted using the Roche MagNA Pure Compact and RNA Isolation Kit. Testing was performed using Invitrogen SuperScript enzyme mastermix and utilizing either the Applied Biosystems QSDx or QIAGEN QMDx. The results are summarized in the Table 13 and Table 14 below. Each real-time PCR instruments demonstrated $100 \%$ agreement with the comparator.
