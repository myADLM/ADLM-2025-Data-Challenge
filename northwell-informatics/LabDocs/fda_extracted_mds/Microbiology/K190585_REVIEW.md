# H. Indication(s) for Use:

1. Indications for Use(s):

The BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) is a qualitative multiplexed nucleic acid-based in vitro diagnostic test intended for use with the BioCode MDx 3000 Instrument. The BioCode GPP is capable of the simultaneous detection and identification of nucleic acids from multiple bacteria, viruses, and parasites extracted directly from unpreserved stool samples or stool preserved in Cary-Blair transport medium obtained from individuals with signs and/or symptoms of gastrointestinal infection. The following bacteria, parasites, and viruses are identified using the BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel:

• Campylobacter (C. jejuni/C. coli)   
• Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) toxin A/B (Fresh samples only)   
• Salmonella spp.   
• Vibrio (V. parahaemolyticus/V. vulnificus/ V. cholerae), including specific identification of Vibrio parahaemolyticus   
Yersinia enterocolitica   
Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC)   
• Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) lt/st   
• E. coli O157 serogroup   
• Shiga-like toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) stx1/stx2   
• Shigella/ Enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC)   
• Cryptosporidium spp. (C. parvum/C. hominis)   
• Entamoeba histolytica   
• Giardia lamblia (also known as G. intestinalis and G. duodenalis)   
• Adenovirus F 40/41   
• Norovirus GI/GII   
• Rotavirus A

The BioCode GPP is indicated as an aid in the diagnosis of specific agents of gastrointestinal illness and results are meant to be used in conjunction with other clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological data. For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only. For Prescription Use Only.

Positive results do not rule out co-infection with organisms not included in the BioCode GPP. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of the disease. Negative results in the setting of clinical illness compatible with gastroenteritis may be due to infection by pathogens that are not detected by this test or non-infectious causes such as ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, or Crohn’s disease. Concomitant culture is necessary for organism recovery and further typing of bacterial agents. This device is not intended to monitor or guide treatment for $C .$ difficile infection.

Due to the small number of positive specimens collected for certain organisms during the prospective clinical study, performance characteristics for Adenovirus 40/41, Campylobacter, E. coli O157, Shigella/EIEC, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Giardia lamblia were established additionally with retrospective clinical specimens. Performance characteristics for Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, Yersinia enterocolitica and Vibrio (V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus, and V. cholerae) were established primarily using contrived clinical specimens.

2. Special conditions for use statement(s): For in vitro diagnostic use only For prescription use only.

3. Special instrument requirements: For use with the BioCode MDx 3000 instrument.

# I. Device Description:

The BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) is a multiplexed nucleic acid-based test designed to be used with the BioCode MDx 3000 system.

# a. Reproducibility:

A study was performed to assess the Reproducibility of the BioCode GPP using samples extracted with the MagNA Pure 96. This study was designed to assess intra-assay (within run), inter-assay (run-to-run), day-to-day and instrument-toinstrument (operator-to-operator) reproducibility. One lot of reagents was assayed at Applied BioCode on 3 instruments by 3 operators, 2 runs per day per operator for 5 days (total of 30 runs). The reproducibility panel consisted of 7 contrived samples (sample 7 is a negative control) extracted in triplicate and each assayed in singlet. The samples consisted of combinations of 12 representative targets at $1 . 5 \mathrm { x }$ LoD (Low) and 3x LoD (Medium). Results from the study are shown in Table 1 below.

# d. Limit of detection:

A study was performed to assess the performance of the BioCode GPP on the BioCode MDx 3000 at the Limit of Detection (LoD) for both unpreserved Stool and Cary-Blair specimens. In this study the GI Panel was tested with quantified bacteria, virus or parasite stocks (except norovirus which used clinical samples). For initial screening, four replicates of each concentration (near LoD for the predicate) in negative stool and Cary-Blair were extracted on the easyMAG and MagNA Pure 96 Systems and tested in singlet with the BioCode GPP on the BioCode MDx 3000 system. The LoD was confirmed by extracting 20 replicates of each sample type/extraction method and testing each in singlet for a total of 20 replicates at or near presumptive LoD. LoD for each stock was defined as the lowest concentration with $2 9 5 \%$ detection of 20 replicates (19 out of 20). Results are shown in the Tables below.

For Norovirus GI and GII targets, positive clinical specimens were used, and serial dilutions (initial 10- fold dilution series followed by finer dilutions) were performed. Four replicates of each dilution in negative unpreserved stool and CaryBlair stool were extracted with the easyMAG and MagNA Pure 96 Systems and tested with the BioCode GPP on the BioCode MDx 3000 system. The LoD was confirmed by extracting 20 replicates of each sample type with each extraction method and testing at or near presumptive LoD. For unpreserved stool, LoD with the easyMAG extraction was 2-fold and 8.3-fold lower than the MagNA Pure 96 extraction for Norovirus GI and Norovirus GII, respectively. For Cary-Blair stool, LoD with the easyMAG extraction was less than 2-fold lower than the MagNA Pure 96 extraction for both Norovirus GI and GII. Results are shown in the tables below.

# h. Carry-Over/Cross-Contamination study:

A study was performed to demonstrate the absence of carryover or crosscontamination of the MagNA Pure 96. High-positive samples (Shigella sonnei, ATCC 29930 at $5 . 4 2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L } )$ were tested alternating with no-template control samples in a “checkerboard” pattern. Samples were extracted an alternating pattern of high and low concentration then and assayed individually. The study consisted of five complete MagNA Pure 96 well runs and assayed on two BioCode MDx 3000 instruments. No evidence of carry-over contamination was observed.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable   
b. Matrix Comparison : Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

A clinical investigational study was performed in which a total of 466 leftover, deidentified archived specimens (275 frozen unpreserved and 191 inoculated Cary-Blair) that were previously characterized as positive from the BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (K180041) clinical study were collected. Fifty-three (53) freshly collected leftover samples were used for $C .$ . difficile testing. In addition, a total of 120 samples were contrived and tested to determine the performance characteristics for Entamoeba histolytica, Yersinia enterocolitica and Vibrio (V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus, and V. cholerae). Specimens were extracted using the MagNA Pure 96 and the easyMAG and tested with the BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) on the MDx 3000 system.

PPA was calculated as TP / $( \mathrm { T P } + \mathrm { F N } )$ . $\mathrm { T P } =$ true positive or positive by both the EasyMAG and the MagNA Pure 96; $\mathrm { F N } =$ false negative or negative by the MagNA Pure 96 only. NPA was calculated as $\mathrm { T N } / ( \mathrm { T N } + \mathrm { F P } )$ . $\mathrm { T N } =$ true negative or negative by the EasyMAG and the MagNA Pure 96; $\mathrm { F P = }$ false positive or positive by the MagNA Pure 96 only. The exact binomial two-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence interval was calculated. The results stratified by sample type and storage method are presented in the Table below.

# N. Instrument Name:

BioCode MDx 3000 instrument

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device?

Yes

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?

No

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes

3. Specimen Identification: Specimen identity is provided by barcode magnetic beads.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

After extraction with the easyMAG or MagNA Pure 96 system and loading samples into a 96well formatted plate, the BioCode MDx 3000 processes all RT-PCR steps automatically.

5. Calibration:

Optical calibration of the MDx 3000 is performed twice a year by Applied BioCode. No calibration kit is available.

6. Quality Control:

Each laboratory should establish its own Quality Control ranges and frequency of QC testing based on applicable local laws, regulations and good laboratory practices. The BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) uses an internal control (bacteriophage MS2) which is added to each sample during pre- treatment. The internal control monitors the efficiency of the extraction, reverse transcription, amplification and detection stages of the assay. Positive results may be reported in the absence of RNA IC detection. The BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) software will suppress negative results for any wells with invalid RNA IC results.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered in the “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

Not applicable.

# Q. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.

# R. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is sufficient to support a substantial equivalence decision for the BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP).
