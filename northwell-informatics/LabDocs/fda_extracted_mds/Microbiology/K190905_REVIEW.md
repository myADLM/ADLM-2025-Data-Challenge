# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

This submission is for a single drug in the Gram-negative ID/AST or AST only panel. The ID portion of the ID/AST combination panel was not subject for review in this submission.

The Phoenix AST method is a broth-based microdilution test. The Phoenix panel is a sealed and selfinoculating molded polystyrene tray, with 136 micro-wells containing dried reagents. The ID/AST combination panel includes an ID side (51 wells) with dried substrates for bacterial identification and an AST side (85 wells). The AST panel contains a wide range of two-fold doubling dilution concentrations of antimicrobial agents and growth and fluorescent controls at appropriate well locations. The AST panel does not include wells for isolate identification.

The Phoenix System utilizes a redox indicator for the detection of organism growth in the presence of an antimicrobial agent. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily identified as Gram-positive or Gram-negative. Colonies are then suspended in ID broth, and equated to a 0.5 McFarland suspension using a nephelometer device. A further dilution is made into AST broth (a cation-adjusted formulation of Mueller-Hinton broth containing $0 . 0 1 0 \%$ Tween 80), to which the redox-buffered oxidation-reduction AST indicator solution is added producing a blue color in the wells. The concentration of organisms in the final AST broth suspension is approximately $5 \mathrm { X }$ $1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ .

The Phoenix AST Broth is poured into the inoculation port of the AST panel and the inoculum flows into the panel, filling panel wells. Polyethylene caps are applied to seal the inoculation ports. An air admittance port is located in the panel lid to ensure adequate oxygen tension in the panel for the duration of the test. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System instrument where panels are continuously incubated at $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Continuous measurements of changes to the indicator as well as bacterial turbidity are used in the determination of bacterial growth. The instrument takes readings every 20 minutes. Organisms growing in the presence of a given antimicrobial agent reduce the indicator (changing it to a pink color). This signals organism growth and resistance to that antimicrobial agent. Organisms killed or inhibited by the antimicrobial agent do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do not produce a color change. The Phoenix instrument reads and records the results of the antimicrobial tests contained in the panel and interprets the reactions (based on the organism identification) to give a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value and category interpretations (susceptible, intermediate, resistant or not susceptible). AST results are available within 4 to 16 hours. This is an autoread result; no manual readings are possible with this system.

Additional comments concerning specific organism/antimicrobial combinations is provided from the software-driven “EXPERT” system, using rules derived from CLSI documentation and/or the FDAapproved Ceftaroline drug label.

# B Principle of Operation:

The BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System is a broth-based microdilution method that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance detection of organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control wells” that contain no antibiotic.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility:

A reproducibility study was performed at three clinical sites using 11 isolates of non-fastidious Gram-negative organisms. The isolates were tested at each site in triplicate over three different days using both inoculation methods (i.e., manual, BD Phoenix AP) resulting in 297 data points (11 strains $\textbf { X } 3$ replicates $\textrm { x 3 }$ sites x 3 days $= 2 9 7$ ). The isolates tested in the reproducibility study included C. freundii (2), $E$ . cloacae (2), $E$ . coli (5), and $K .$ . pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae (2). The reproducibility was calculated based on MIC values falling within $\pm 1$ dilution of the predetermined mode of the reference MIC values. There was one “off-scale” MIC result with manually prepared inocula and two “off-scale” results with inocula prepared using the BD Phoenix AP. The best and worst case reproducibility was calculated as described in the AST Special Controls Guidance document. The reproducibility results were acceptable as shown in Table 2.

# Inoculum Density Check:

The BD PhoenixSpec Nephelometer was used to prepare the inocula for testing of the clinical, challenge, reproducibility, and QC isolates. The same inoculum suspension was used for both the Phoenix System and the reference method testing. The BD Phoenix AP instrument was used to standardize the inocula for challenge, QC, and reproducibility isolates. Validation data for both the PhoenixSpec and the Phoenix AP instrument was provided and found to be acceptable.

# Growth Failure Rate

The growth rate for both inoculation methods was $9 9 . 9 \%$

Purity Check: Purity check plates were performed on all isolates from each inoculum preparation.

7. Assay Cut-Off: Not Applicable

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

Results obtained with the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System - GN Ceftaroline $( 0 . 0 1 5 - 4 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ panel were compared to results obtained with the CLSI frozen broth microdilution reference panel. Reference panels were prepared according to CLSI M07-A10 guidelines. The range of dilutions evaluated with the reference panels was the same as that used for the BD Ceftaroline panel.

The BD Phoenix Spec Nephelometer, the primary inoculation method, was used to obtain a $0 . 5 0 - 0 . 6 0 \mathrm { ~ ] }$ McFarland for all challenge, clinical, QC, and reproducibility isolates. The BD Phoenix AP instrument, the secondary inoculation method, was used to test challenge, QC, and reproducibility isolates. It is designed to standardize the ID broth inoculum equivalent to the BD Phoenix Spec Nephelometer, add the preset amount of AST indicator broth to the AST broth tube, and transfer the required aliquot of ID broth inoculum to AST broth tubes.

# Clinical:

Clinical testing was conducted at three sites using 832 fresh $( 9 1 . 8 \% )$ and 74 stock $( 8 . 2 \% )$ Enterobacteriaceae organisms for a total of 906 clinical isolates. These consisted of $C .$ . freundii (35 isolates), $C .$ . koseri (45), Citrobacter species (21), $E .$ . aerogenes (65), $E$ . cloacae (81), Enterobacter species (5), $E .$ . coli (294), K. oxytoca (58), $K .$ pneumoniae (180), $M .$ morganii (36), and $P .$ . mirabilis (86). Of the clinical isolates, 174 isolates were determined to be resistant to ceftaroline by the reference method.

# Challenge:

Additional stock challenge isolates were tested at each study site. These isolates consisted of organisms with known resistance mechanisms (e.g., isolates obtained from FDA/CDC AR bank) to challenge the ability of AST system to correctly identify the susceptibility category. Challenge testing was conducted using 117 Enterobacteriaceae organisms including $C .$ . freundii (13), C. koseri (1), $E .$ . aerogenes (1), E. cloacae (28), E. coli (25), $K .$ . oxytoca (10), K. pneumoniae (36), and $P _ { - }$ . mirabilis (3). Of these 117 challenge isolates, 83 were resistant to ceftaroline by the reference method.

Results for clinical and challenge isolates were evaluated separately and combined. Table 4 below illustrates the performance of testing ceftaroline using the manual inoculation method only. To address testing of non-indicated species, the sponsor included the following statement in the Precautions section of the device labeling:

Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the safety and efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested by this AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those found in the indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of susceptibility information in those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for specific antimicrobial drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is approved.

EA - Essential Agreement maj – major discrepancies CA - Category Agreement vmj - very major discrepancies R - resistant isolates min – minor discrepancies

Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the result of the reference method and that of BD Phoenix within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are on scale for both the BD Phoenix panel and the reference method. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the BD Phoenix result.

The Phoenix ceftaroline performance met the acceptance criteria for Enterobacteriaceae with overall EA an CA greater than $90 \%$ . However, when species were evaluated separately, $M .$ morganii demonstrated an overall EA and CA of $4 7 . 2 \%$ and $6 9 . 4 \%$ , respectively. In addition, the major error rate and very major error rate for $M .$ . morganii was unacceptable at $2 6 . 9 \%$ (7/26) and $10 \%$ (1/10). Performance when testing this organism is therefore not acceptable. To address this, the following was included in the labeling:

Results for the following antimicrobic/organism combination(s) are suppressed from reporting by the BD Phoenix System:

# Ceftaroline: Morganella morganii

When performance was evaluated excluding $M .$ . morganii (Table 5), the overall EA and CA increased from $9 3 . 0 \%$ to $9 4 . 6 \%$ and $9 5 . 2 \%$ to $9 6 . 1 \%$ , respectively. In addition, the overall major error rate and very major rate was $0 . 6 \%$ (4/709) and $1 . 2 \%$ (3/249), respectively, and was deemed acceptable.

# Enzyme Group Characterization/Resistance Markers Information:

Enterobacteriaceae with beta-lactamases were included in the ceftaroline comparative studies which consisted of the challenge isolates that were tested. Isolates with the following beta lactamases were included: AmpC (4), KPC (26), OXA (11), CTX-M (8), TEM (14), and SHV (9). The Enterobacteriaceae included $C .$ . freundii, $E$ . aerogenes, E. cloacae, $E .$ . coli, K. oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, and $P .$ . mirabilis.

# Trending:

An analysis of trending was conducted using the combined clinical and challenge data for each organism group. This trending calculation considers MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or higher compared to the reference method regardless of whether the device MIC values are on-scale. Results that are not clearly at least one dilution lower, at least one dilution higher or in exact agreement with the CLSI reference method are not considered in the trending analysis.

Trending analysis results are shown in Table 7; results were stratified by species to assess species-related trends. Species for which the difference between the percentage of isolates with higher or lower readings was ${ \ge } 3 0 $ with a statistically significant confidence interval were considered to show evidence of trending. When combined Enterobacteriaceae isolates were assessed, there was no trending observed; however, when each species was evaluated separately, it was noted that MIC values for $C .$ . koseri and $P$ . mirabilis trended higher when compared to the reference method. Therefore, the following was included in the labeling to indicate this:

MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or at least one doubling dilution higher compared to the reference broth micro-dilution when testing the following:
