# Device Description

The Fungitell® STAT assay provides a qualitative measurement of ( $\displaystyle { 1 \to 3 }$ )- $\cdot \beta$ -Dglucan. The assay is based upon a modification of the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) pathway1,2,3,4, Figure 1.

![](images/fd64cf3f4c18e50a266d1073f9104f90c51aec5a1c26b20c33a9d7e0de34d361.jpg)  
Figure 1. Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Pathway

The Fungitell® STAT Reagent is modified to eliminate bacterial endotoxin reactivity and, thus, to only react to ( $1  3$ )- $\beta$ -D-glucan, through the Factor Gmediated side of the pathway. $\displaystyle { ( 1 \to 3 ) }$ )- $\beta$ -D-glucan activates Factor G, a serine protease zymogen. The activated Factor G converts the inactive pro-clotting enzyme to the active clotting enzyme, which in turn cleaves the para-nitroanilide substrate, Boc-Leu-Gly-Arg-pNA, creating a chromophore, para-nitroaniline (pNA), that absorbs at $4 0 5 \mathrm { n m }$ . The Fungitell® STAT kinetic assay is based upon the determination of the rate of optical density increase produced by a sample. This rate is interpreted against the rate of optical density increase of the Fungitell® STAT Standard to produce an index. This patient sample index value is qualitatively interpreted as a Negative, Indeterminate or Positive result according to the index value ranges provided in Table 1 below. The Fungitell® STAT Standard is calibrated at $8 0 + / - 8 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ which is the Positive cut-off for the Fungitell® predicate.

# Intended Use

The Fungitell® STAT assay is a protease zymogen-based colorimetric assay for the qualitative detection of $( 1 \to 3 )$ )- $\boldsymbol { \cdot } \boldsymbol { \beta }$ -D-glucan in the serum of patients with symptoms of, or medical conditions predisposing the patient to, invasive fungal infection. The serum concentration of ( $1 \to 3$ )- $\beta$ -D-glucan, a major cell-wall component of various medically important fungi5, can be used as an aid in the diagnosis of deep-seated mycoses and fungemias6. A positive result does not indicate which genus of fungi may be causing infection.

$[ 1  3 ]$ )- $\beta$ -D-glucan index values should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic procedures, such as microbiological culture, histological examination of biopsy samples and radiological examination.

#  Technological Characteristics and Substantial Equivalence Discussions

The Fungitell® STAT assay is a design modification to the Fungitell® assay format. The Fungitell® STAT assay was developed to answer the need for a single use test format and smaller kit size relative to the 96-well plate format of the predicate device Fungitell® assay.

There is an increasing incidence of fungal infections by opportunistic pathogens, especially in immuno-compromised patients7,8,9. Invasive fungal diseases, as opportunistic infections, are common among hematological malignancy and AIDS patients and account for a growing number of nosocomial infections, particularly among organ transplant recipients and other patients receiving immunosuppressive treatments10,11. Many fungal diseases are acquired by inhaling fungal spores originating from the soil, plant detritus, air-handling systems and/or exposed surfaces. Some opportunistic fungi are present in/on human skin, the intestinal tract, and mucous membranes12,13. Diagnosis of invasive mycoses and fungemias is usually based on non-specific diagnostic or radiological techniques. Recently, biological markers of fungal infection have been added to the available diagnostic methods6.

Opportunistic fungal pathogens include Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp., Trichosporon spp., Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Acremonium spp., Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Sporothrix schenckii, Exserohilum rostratum, and Pneumocystis jirovecii. The ( $1 {  } 3$ )- $\cdot \beta$ -D-glucan

produced by these organisms, and others, can be detected by the Fungitell® assay5,12,14,15.

The Fungitell® STAT device is a modified version of the Fungitell® predicate device. It has the same intended use, similar technological characteristics and is substantially equivalent to the predicate device identified in Table 2 below. Both the Fungitell® STAT and the predicate device cover the same analytical measurement range.

# Performance Testing

- Assay Cut-off study

The index cut-off values for the Fungitell® STAT were determined using CLSI EP24-A2. Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy of Laboratory Tests Using Receiver Operating Characteristics Curves; Approved Guideline- Second Edition. Ninety three (93) de-identified patient serum samples collected for routine clinical care of the intended population were used for the study. The ( $1  3$ )- $\beta$ -D-Glucan concentrations covered the full measuring range of the predicate device, Fungitell® standard curve (i.e. $3 1 { - } 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L } )$ . These samples were used for the Receiver Operating Characteristics analysis of which 44 samples were Positive, 15 were Indeterminate and 34 were Negative based on the predicate device Fungitell®. The index cut-off values for Fungitell® STAT were determined to be 0.75 on the Negative side and 1.1 on the Positive side which provided the boundaries of the Indeterminate zone leading to index value ranges of ${ \le } 0 . 7 4$ , 0.75 - 1.1 and ${ \ge } 1 . 2$ for the Negative, Indeterminate and Positive zone, respectively.

# Method Comparison study

A method comparison study was performed at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) laboratory using de-identified patient serum samples collected for routine clinical care of the intended population. A population of 488 de-identified patient serum samples was included in the study with $( 1 \to 3 )$ )- $\boldsymbol { \cdot } \boldsymbol { \beta }$ -D-Glucan concentrations distributed over the full range of the predicate device Fungitell® standard curve (i.e. $3 1 { - } 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L } )$ ). As indicated in Table 3, a total of $3 0 9 \mathrm { N }$ egative samples, 36 Indeterminate samples and 143 Positive samples based on the predicate device Fungitell® were included in the study.

When samples falling within the Indeterminate zone (i.e. italic numbers within

Table 3) were excluded, there were 119 samples left for the Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) analysis and 290 samples left for the Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) analysis. The resulting PPA was $9 9 . 2 \%$ , $9 5 \%$ confidence interval (CI): $( 9 5 . 4 \%$ , $9 9 . 9 \%$ ) and the NPA was $9 7 . 6 \%$ , $9 5 \%$ CI: $9 5 . 4 \%$ , $9 9 . 9 \%$ ). If indeterminates were considered discordant results (e.g. false positives or false negatives), performance is as follows: PPA: $7 3 . 8 \%$ (118/160), $9 5 \%$ CI: $6 6 . 4 \%$ , $8 0 . 0 \%$ ); NPA - $9 1 . 0 \%$ (283/311), $9 5 \%$ CI: $( 8 7 . 3 \% , 9 3 . 7 \% )$ .

# Precision/Reproducibility

The precision/reproducibility study was performed following Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline-Third Edition (CLSI document EP05-A3). The Fungitell STAT was evaluated for precision/reproducibility by spiking human serum with Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( $1  3$ )- $\beta$ -D-Glucan to produce a panel consisting of a low negative sample, high negative sample (just below the lower cut-off of 0.74), indeterminate (equivocal) sample, low positive sample (just above the upper cut-off of 1.2) and high positive sample ${ \sim } 2 \mathbf { x }$ above the upper cut-off of 1.2). This panel was tested twice per day, in triplicate, at three sites by multiple operators over a five-day period (1 panel member x twice per day x 3 replicates $\textbf { X } 3$ sites x 5 days $= 9 0$ measurements per panel member) to determine the precision/reproducibility of the assay. Results are shown in Table 4.

The values in Table 4 are derived from the data provided by the three laboratories. The Percent Positive $\%$ Positive) represents the number of Fungitell® STAT index values that fell within the Positive zone.

The Fungitell® STAT precision (intra-assay variation) $\%$ CV ranged from $0 . 4 \%$ to $2 6 . 8 \%$ and the inter-assay variation ranged from $1 1 \%$ to $2 0 . 4 4 \%$ . These $\%$ CV values are consistent with what was observed for the predicate Fungitell® assay.
