# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

A study was performed to determine the reproducibility of the Cepheid Xpert MRSA NxG Control Panel using the Cepheid Xpert MRSA NxG Assay on the GeneXpert Instrument System. Testing was done at three different locations over five days. At each location, two operators each tested three lots of control material for a total of at least 90 test results for each control swab (3 sites x 5 days $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ operators $\mathbf { X } \geq 3$ replicates $= { \geq } 9 0$ replicates in total). Summaries of the results for both the positive and negative controls are provided in Table 2 and Table 3. On initial testing one positive control and three negative controls were reported as “ERROR” due to system failure. In each case, retesting was performed with new control swabs and all positive and negative controls produced the expected results.

Traceability: Not applicable.

# Stability:

1. Shelf-life was established through an Accelerated Stability Study that was performed with three lots of the Cepheid Xpert MRSA NxG Control Panel placed at elevated temperatures $( 4 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $5 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $6 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ). Four replicates of the positive control were tested at each of the four time points (Day 0, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42). The negative control was tested in duplicate at two time points (Day 0 and Day 42). At each time point, each replicate of both the positive and negative controls produced the expected results with the Cepheid Xpert

MRSA NxG Assay on the GeneXpert Instrument System. Together with regression analysis of Ct values, these results were used to support assignment of 9 month expiration dating from the date of manufacture when the Cepheid Xpert MRSA NxG Control Panel is held at $2 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ - $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

2. A Real-Time, Shelf-Life Stability Study is in process. Under a 14-point regression design, three lots of each control will be incubated at two temperatures $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ). Regression analysis will be performed at the end of the study to evaluate performance and determine if the acceptance criteria are met. At that time, the expiration date will be updated to the time point at which all criteria are met.

3. An In-Use Stability Study was done to determine how long the positive and negative controls would remain stable after reconstitution. Controls from a single lot were rehydrated and kept at room temperature for different time periods prior to testing. All results were as expected and indicate that Cepheid Xpert MRSA NxG Control Panel swabs may be used up to five hours following rehydration.
