# II Submission/Device Overview:

A Purpose for Submission: New device 510(k) clearance for the CareStart Flu A&B Plus

B Measurand: Influenza A and influenza B viral nucleoprotein antigens

C Type of Test: Qualitative Immunoassay

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

# A Intended Use(s):

The CareStart Flu A&B Plus is an in vitro rapid immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative detection of influenza virus type A and B nucleoprotein antigens directly from nasopharyngeal swab specimens of symptomatic patients.

The test is intended for use as an aid in the rapid differential diagnosis of acute influenza type A and B viral infections. This test is intended to distinguish between influenza type A and/or B virus in a single test. This test is not intended to detect influenza type C viral antigens. Negative test results are presumptive and should be confirmed by viral culture or an FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay. Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infections and should not be used as the basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.

Performance characteristics for influenza A and B were established during the 2018-2019 influenza season when influenza A/H3N2 and A/H1N1pdm09, and B/Victoria were the predominant influenza viruses in circulation. When other influenza viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

If infection with a novel influenza virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to the state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to received and culture specimens.

B Indication(s) for Use: Same as Intended Use(s)

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Rx - For Prescription Use Only

D Special Instrument Requirements: N/A

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The CareStart Flu A&B Plus test is an immunochromatographic assay for detection of extracted influenza type A and B virus nucleoprotein antigens in nasopharyngeal swab specimens.

The assay kit consists of 20 cassettes (each cassette contains one test strip), 20 extraction vials, 20 caps, 20 swabs for the collection of nasopharyngeal specimens, and three external control swabs, two positive control swabs and one negative control swab. One of the positive control swabs contains inactivated influenza A virus dried onto the swab and the other positive control swab contains inactivated influenza B dried onto the swab. The negative control swab contains inactivated Streptococcus Group A dried onto the swab.

The kit may be stored at $1 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# B Principle of Operation:

The CareStart Flu A&B Plus test is based on antigen-antibody binding technology. The virus antigens are released from the specimen during the extraction step. Three drops of the extracted sample are added to the cassette that contains a testing strip. During the migration through the strip, the viral antigens bind to anti-influenza A and anti-influenza B antibodies conjugated to indicator particles. The antigen-antibody complexes migrate through the test strip and are captured by reagents on the membrane to form test lines and a control line. There are two separate test lines, one detecting influenza A antigens and one detecting influenza B antigens. The control line is formed by absorbing residual sample and serves as the internal control for the assay. The test is visually read 10 minutes after the sample is added to the cassette.

Results Interpretation:

• The presence of two lines in the cassette, one for influenza A next to the letter “A” and one control line next to the letter “C”, indicates influenza A positive result.   
• The presence of two lines in the cassette, one for influenza B next to the letter “B” and one control line next to the letter “C”, indicates influenza B positive result.   
• The presence of three lines in the cassette, one for influenza A next to the letter “A”, one for influenza B next to the letter “B”, and one control line next to the letter “C”, indicates a double positive for influenza A and influenza B result.   
• The presence of the control line in the cassette next to the letter “C” without any other lines indicates a negative result.   
• The absence of a C line, regardless of whether any other lines are present or absent, represents an invalid result.

The sample with invalid result should be retested using the remaining sample present in the extraction vial.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

A Analytical Performance:

A seven-member panel was used in all three precision/reproducibility studies described in the sections below. The panel was made using two virus strains. For the reproducibility study and the within laboratory repeatability study influenza A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1) pdm09 and influenza B/Phuket/3073/13 were used. For the lot-lo-lot reproducibility study influenza A/Perth/16/2009 and influenza B/Colorado/06/2017 were used. Each strain was diluted into Universal Transport Medium (UTM) at three different target levels: moderate positive ( $- 3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD), low positive $( { \sim } 1 \mathrm { x } \ \mathrm { L o D } )$ , and high negative ${ \bf \zeta } ^ { \prime } \mathrm { \sim } 0 . 1 { \bf x }$ LoD). Panel members were formulated with only one target present (influenza A or influenza B). Negative samples did not contain influenza virus. Simulated nasal swabs were prepared by pipetting $2 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of sample (virus dilution) onto the head of the swab. Each swab was allowed to dry using vacuum dryer and then sealed in a desiccated pouch. The swabs were removed from the pouches prior to testing and the testing was performed according to the instructions for use.

# Within-Laboratory Repeatability

The within-laboratory precision of the CareStart Flu A&B Plus was evaluated in a study performed inhouse over 15 non-consecutive days, with two operators. One lot of devices was used to test in triplicate the seven-member panel described above.

The qualitative results from the within-laboratory precision study are summarized in Table 1 below.

The study results showed no cross-reactivity of the above listed microorganisms with the CareStart Flu A&B Plus assay at the concentrations tested. All influenza negative samples gave negative results. In addition, all influenza A and influenza B samples tested positive in the presence of the above listed microorganisms showing no interference at the concentrations tested.

# Competitive Interference

The study was performed to evaluate if the CareStart Flu A&B Plus assay can detect low levels of influenza A in the presence of high levels of influenza B and vice versa. Four influenza strains were used in this study: influenza A/Perth/16/2009, influenza A/Michigan/45/2015, influenza B/Colorado/06/2017, and influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013. For low concentration samples, influenza strains were diluted to approximately 1x LoD and for the high concentrations 5-fold dilutions of the virus stock were used. Using a pipette, $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of each influenza sample was applied to a swab. The swabs were tested in triplicate. Low and high concentrations of the influenza strains used in this study are presented in Table 5 below.

# Biotin Interference

Positive influenza swabs were prepared for four viral strains: influenza A/Perth/16/2009, influenza A/Michigan/45/2015, influenza B/Colorado/06/2017, and influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013. Viruses were diluted in UTM to approximately $2 \mathbf { x }$ LoD and biotin was spiked to the levels presented in the table below. The swabs were prepared by pipetting $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of sample to the swab. The negative swabs contained UTM and biotin only. Positive and negative samples were tested in triplicate.

The results from the biotin interference study are summarized in Table 8 below.

Biotin concentrations up to $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ did not lead to false results. Biotin concentrations ${ > } 5 0 0$ $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ may cause false negative influenza A results with the CareStart Flu A&B Plus. Due to the relatively high level of biotin tolerance and the specimen type, which is unlikely to have biotin concentrations as high as what is observed in serum/plasma specimens, no limitation in the labeling regarding the biotin interference was necessary.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

# Internal Quality Control

The CareStart Flu A&B Plus assay contains built in internal assay control. The control line contains control antibodies which bind residual sample. The appearance of the control line on the test ensures that sufficient flow of the sample occurred during the assay.

# External Quality Controls

The CareStart Flu A&B Plus kit contains two positive external control swabs (one for influenza A and one for influenza B) and one negative external control swab that allow for

monitoring of the performance of the assay. Influenza A positive external control contains inactivated influenza A virus, influenza B positive external control contains inactivated influenza B virus. Negative control swab contains inactivated Streptococcus sp. Group A.

# External Controls Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility

The lot-to-lot reproducibility for the external positive and negative control swabs was evaluated using three lots of external controls with three operators. The results from the study are summarized in Table 9 below.

# 6. Detection Limit:

The limit of detection (LoD) of the assay was determined with four strains of influenza A virus and four strains of influenza B virus in three step process. First, the initial LoD range was established using a series of five-fold dilutions of virus stocks prepared in UTM. Using a pipette, $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of each dilution was applied to a swab. The swabs were tested in triplicate. The lowest concentration that resulted in $100 \%$ detection (3/3) was used to test 20 replicates. The dilution that resulted in $2 9 5 \%$ detection was considered initial LoD range. In the next step, a series of two-fold dilutions in negative nasal matrix near the initial LoD range were prepared. Using a pipette, $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of each dilution were applied to a swab and tested in triplicate until a negative result was obtained for at least one of the replicates. The estimated LoD was confirmed by testing 20 replicates. The results from the study are presented in Table 10 below.

2. Matrix Comparison:

# Matrix Equivalency

Matrix equivalency study was conducted to determine if UTM can be used as a substitute to natural negative clinical matrix in analytical studies performed to evaluate the CareStart Flu A&B Plus assay. Influenza A/Michigan/45/2015 and influenza B/Colorado/06/2017 were diluted in natural nasal swab matrix or UTM. The pooled natural matrix was prepared by eluting nasal swabs in $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of UTM and combing matrix obtained from 17 healthy volunteers. The negativity for influenza A and B of the pooled matrix was confirmed by testing with an FDA-cleared molecular assay. The swabs were prepared by pipetting $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of sample onto each swab. A series of 5-fold dilutions of each influenza strain were tested in triplicate until at least one negative result was obtained. The lowest dilution that generated $100 \%$ positive results (3/3) was confirmed by testing 20 replicates. The results from the matrix equivalency study are presented in Table 12 below.

The performance of the CareStart Flu A&B Plus assay was evaluated against an FDAcleared molecular assay. Two nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the same nostril of each patient participating in the clinical study. The first swab was tested with an FDAcleared molecular assay and the second swab was tested with the CareStart Flu A&B Plus. The discrepant results were further analyzed by testing with an alternative FDA-cleared molecular assay. The performance estimates for influenza A and B compared to an FDAcleared molecular assay are presented in Tables 14-15 below. The results of discrepant analyses are presented as footnotes and were not included in the calculation of the performance estimates.
