# 1. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The cobas® Influenza A/B assay is a rapid, automated in vitro diagnostic test for qualitative detection and differentiation of Influenza type A and type B viral RNA. The assay is performed on the cobas® Liat® System. The system automates and integrates sample purification, nucleic acid amplification, and detection of the target sequence in biological samples using real-time RT-PCR assays. The cobas® Liat® Analyzer consists of an instrument and preloaded software for running tests and viewing the results. The cobas® Liat® System consists of the analyzer and a single-use disposable cobas® Influenza A/B assay tube that holds the sample purification and RT-PCR reagents and hosts the sample preparation and RT-PCR processes. Other than adding the sample to the cobas® Influenza $\mathrm { A } / \mathrm { B }$ assay tube, no reagent preparation or additional steps are required. Because each cobas® Influenza A/B assay tube is self-contained, cross-contamination between samples is minimized. Turnaround time for a test is 20 minutes.

The cobas® Influenza A/B assay includes reagents for the detection and differentiation of Influenza A and B viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens in universal transport media (UTM) from patients suspected of having Influenza. The assay targets a well-conserved region of the matrix gene of Influenza A viral RNA (Inf A target) and non-structural protein (NS) gene of Influenza B (Inf B target). An Internal Process Control (IPC) is also included. The IPC is present to control for adequate processing of the target viruses through all steps of the assay process and to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the RT-PCR reactions.

The cobas® Influenza A/B assay tube uses a flexible tube as a sample processing vessel. It contains all requisite PCR reagents pre-packed in assay tube segments separated by breakable seals. When a cobas® Influenza A/B assay tube containing a raw biological sample is inserted into the cobas® Liat® Analyzer, multiple sample processing actuators in the cobas® Liat Analyzer compress the cobas® Influenza A/B assay tube to selectively release the reagents, moving the sample from one segment to the next, and controlling reaction conditions. An embedded microprocessor controls and coordinates these actions to perform all required assay processes, including sample preparation, nucleic acid extraction, target concentration enrichment, inhibitor removal, nucleic acid elution, and real-time PCR. All assay steps are performed within the closed and self-contained cobas® Influenza A/B assay tube, minimizing cross-contamination between samples.

The detection module monitors the reaction in real-time, while an on-board computer analyzes the collected data and outputs an interpreted result. The latter is displayed in the assay report on the integrated LCD touch screen of the cobas® Liat® Analyzer and in an electronic file. The report can be printed directly through a USB or network-connected printer. The results can also be exported to an external server, middleware or data management system, or to a Laboratory Information System (LIS).

# 1.1. Test Workflow

Nasopharyngeal swab can be collected following the user institution’s standard procedures. For nasopharyngeal swab samples suspended in UTM, a user transfers $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the UTM sample into cobas® Influenza A/B assay tube.

A user then scans the assay tube barcode to identify the test and scans the sample barcode to code the sample ID using the cobas® Liat® System. The assay tube is then inserted into the cobas® Liat® Analyzer. The analyzer performs all test steps and outputs interpreted results in 20 minutes. A report of the interpreted results can be viewed in the View Results window, and printed directly through a USB connected printer.

# 2. INTENDED USE

The cobas® Influenza A/B Nucleic acid test for use on the cobas® Liat® System (cobas® Influenza A/B) is an automated multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay for the rapid in vitro qualitative detection and discrimination of Influenza A virus and Influenza B virus RNA in nasopharyngeal swab specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. The test is intended for use as an aid in the differential diagnosis of Influenza A and Influenza B in humans and is not intended to detect Influenza C.

Negative results do not preclude Influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.

Performance characteristics for Influenza A were established when Influenza A/H1 and A/H3 were the predominant Influenza A viruses in circulation. When other Influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a ${ \mathrm { B S L } } 3 +$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

# 3. TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS

The technological characteristics and intended use of cobas® Influenza A/B for use on the cobas® Liat® System, when used with cobas® Influenza A/B assay script (FABA) v1.35, are substantially equivalent to the legally marketed device, which was originally cleared for use with FABA script v1.31.
