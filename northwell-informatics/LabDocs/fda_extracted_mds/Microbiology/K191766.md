Dear Esther Hernandez:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part

801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice (https://www.fda.gov/medical  
devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance) and CDRH Learn   
(https://www.fda.gov/training-and-continuing-education/cdrh-learn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic. See the DICE website (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatoryassistance/contact-us-division-industry-and-consumer-education-dice) for more information or contact DICE by email (DICE@fda.hhs.gov) or phone (1-800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100).

Formal/Trade Name:

VITEK® 2 AST- Gram Negative Eravacycline ( $0 . 1 2 - \geq 4 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$

Classification Name:

21 CFR 866.1645   
Fully Automated Short-Term Incubation Cycle   
Antimicrobial Susceptibility System   
Product Code LON

Common Name:

VITEK® 2 AST-GN Eravacycline

# C. Predicate Device:

VITEK® 2 AST-GN Delafloxacin (K183524)

# D. Device Description:

The principle of the ${ \mathrm { V I T E K } } ^ { \textregistered } 2$ AST cards is based on the microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) technique reported by MacLowry and Marsh (1) and Gerlach (2). The VITEK® 2 AST card is essentially a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling dilution technique (3).

Each VITEK® 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well which only contains microbiological culture media is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of a specific antibiotic combined with culture media. The bacterial or yeast isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with $0 . 4 5 - 0 . 5 \%$ saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The ${ \mathrm { V I T E K } } ^ { \textregistered } ~ .$ 2 System automatically fills, seals and places the card into the incubator/reader. The ${ \mathrm { V I T E K } } ^ { \circledast } 2$ Compact has a manual filling, sealing and loading operation. The $\mathrm { V I T E K ^ { \mathrm { ‰} } }$ 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antibiotic contained on the card.

VITEK® 2 AST-GN Eravacycline has the following concentrations in the card: 0.25, 1, 2 and $4 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ ).

# E. Substantial Equivalence Information:

The similarities and differences of the VITEK $^ { \textregistered } 2$ AST-GN Eravacycline when compared to the predicate device, VITEK® 2 AST-GN Delafloxacin (K183524), are described in the following table.

${ \mathrm { V I T E K } } ^ { \otimes } 2$ AST-Gram Negative Eravacycline is designed for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Gram Negative bacilli and is intended for use with the ${ \mathrm { V I T E K } } ^ { \otimes } 2$ and ${ \mathrm { V I T E K } } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ 2 Compact Systems as a laboratory aid in the determination of in vitro susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. ${ \mathrm { V I T E K } } ^ { \otimes } 2$ AST-Gram Negative Eravacycline is a quantitative test. Eravacycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the microorganisms listed below, according to the FDA label for this antimicrobial.

# Active in vitro and in clinical infections:

Citrobacter freundii Enterobacter cloacae Escherichia coli Klebsiella oxytoca Klebsiella pneumoniae

In vitro data are available, but clinical significance is unknown:

Citrobacter koseri Klebsiella (Enterobacter) aerogenes

The VITEK $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 2 Gram-Negative Susceptibility Card is intended for use with the VITEK $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 2 Systems in clinical laboratories as an in vitro test to determine the susceptibility of clinically significant aerobic Gram-negative bacilli to antimicrobial agents when used as instructed.

# G. Performance Overview and Conclusion:

VITEK $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 2 AST-GN Eravacycline demonstrated substantially equivalent performance when compared with the CLSI broth microdilution reference method, as defined in the FDA Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA (Issued August 28, 2009).

The Premarket Notification $( 5 1 0 [ \mathrm { k } ] )$ presents data in support of VITEK $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 2 ASTGN Eravacycline. An external evaluation was conducted with fresh and stock clinical isolates, as well as a set of challenge strains. The external evaluations were designed to confirm the acceptability of VITEK $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 2 AST-GN Eravacycline by comparing its performance with the CLSI broth microdilution reference method incubated at 16-20 hours. The data is representative of performance on both the VITEK $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 2 and VITEK $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 2 Compact instrument platforms.

VITEK $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 2 AST-GN Eravacycline demonstrated acceptable performance of $9 7 . 0 \%$ overall Essential Agreement and $9 9 . 1 \%$ overall Category Agreement with the reference method. Reproducibility and Quality Control demonstrated acceptable results.
