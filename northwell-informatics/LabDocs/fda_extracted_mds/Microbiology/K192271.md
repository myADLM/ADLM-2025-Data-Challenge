# Summary of Studies

Method Comparison: A comparison of approximately 207 serum samples with PCT concentrations ranging from approximately $0 . 0 5 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ to $1 0 0 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ were run on both the Access PCT assay and the predicate ${ \mathsf { V I D A S } } ^ { \otimes }$ B·R·A·H·M·S PCT®† assay. The results were compared using Passing-Bablok regression and Pearson correlation with the predicate on the $\mathbf { x }$ -axis. The observed linear fit had a slope $= 0 . 9 6$ with $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of 0.94 to 0.99, an intercept $=$   
$0 . 0 2 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and a correlation coefficient $( \mathsf { r } ) = 0 . 9 9$ . The slope specification is set at 0.90 $\pm 0 . 1 0$ with correlation coefficient $( \mathsf { r } ) \geq 0 . 9 5$ .

Imprecision: The Access PCT assay exhibits total imprecision of $\leq 8 . 0 \%$ CV at concentrations $\ge 0 . 1 5 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , and standard deviation $( \mathsf { S D } ) \leq 0 . 0 1 2 \mathsf { n g } / \mathsf { m L }$ at concentrations $< 0 . 1 5 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

The Access PCT assay exhibits within run imprecision of $\leq 6 . 0 \%$ CV at concentrations $\geq$ $0 . 1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , and a standard deviation $( \mathsf { S D } ) \leq 0 . 0 0 9 \mathsf { n g / m L }$ at concentrations $< 0 . 1 5 0$ $\mathsf { n g } / \mathsf { m L }$ .

High-dose Hook Effect: The Access PCT assay demonstrated no high-dose hook effect at concentrations up to at least $5 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

Linearity: The Access PCT assay has demonstrated to be linear across the range of the assay $( 0 . 0 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ to approximately $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } ) }$ ).

Dilution Recovery: The Access PCT assay has been demonstrated to dilute recover across the range of the assay $0 . 0 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ to approximately $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } ) }$ in serum, lithium heparin plasma, and EDTA plasma samples. Samples containing procalcitonin concentrations up to $1 , 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ can be diluted 10-fold with an overall average recovery of $1 0 0 \pm 1 0 \%$ and an individual sample dose recovery within $\pm \ 1 5 \%$ .

# Limit of Blank (LoB):

The highest measurement result observed with no analyte present in a serum sample is ≤ 0.005 ng/mL.

# Limit of Detection (LoD):

The limit of detection (LoD) for the Access PCT assay is $\leq 0 . 0 1 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

Limit of Quantitation (LoQ): The limit of quantitation (LoQ) based on $20 \%$ within-laboratory imprecision for the Access PCT assay is $\leq 0 . 0 2 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

Total Error: The LoQ was established using a $20 \%$ CV acceptance goal as recommended in CLSI guideline EP17-A2 for cases where no generally accepted reference standard is available. To supplement the within-laboratory $\% 0 \% 1 0 \text{‰}$ analysis, a modeling analysis was performed to estimate the Total Error at each clinical cutoff $0 . 5 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and 2.0 $\mathsf { n g } / \mathsf { m L } )$ . The slope and intercept estimates that were derived from the method comparison study were used to obtain estimates of bias and $\%$ bias at each concentration listed above. A precision profile model was fit to the estimated within-laboratory $\% 0 \%$ values from the imprecision study samples with concentration values covering approximately $0 . 1 \mathrm { \ n g / m L }$ to $8 \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . Because the range of samples included in both the method comparison and the imprecision study cover the concentrations $0 . 1 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ to $2 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , the bias estimates and precision profile estimates can be combined to provide an estimate of total error (TE) and $\%$ TE at each medical decision point.

The estimated %TE at the medical decision points $0 . 5 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $2 . 0 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ is $\leq 9 . 4 \%$ based on estimates from Weighted Deming regression and $\leq 1 1 . 3 \%$ from Passing Bablok regression.

Analytical Specificity: Potential cross-reactive substances were added to serum patient samples at three concentrations of procalcitonin (approximately   
$0 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , $0 . 5 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , and $2 . 0 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ). Stock solutions of potential cross- reactants were prepared volumetrically using calibrated pipettes and the appropriate solvent. This stock solution was added directly to the serum in no more than $5 \%$ (v/v) final concentration. Control samples were prepared in the same manner using the solvent, without the crossreactant added. Control and test samples were tested on the Access 2 instrument within 24 hours of preparation, using three reagent lots. Testing of human calcitonin, human katacalcin, human alpha CGRP and human beta CGRP, with Access PCT found that there is no significant cross-reactivity, as defined by a change in concentration between the diluent control and the test samples within $\pm 1 0 \%$ . The acceptance criteria of $\pm 1 0 \%$ was set to ensure that the potential for cross-reactivity is sufficiently mitigated while accommodating the expected imprecision of the assay when performing cross-reactivity testing.

# Interfering Substances:

Known concentrations of potential interferents, as per CLSI EP07 (Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry-Approved Guideline, Third Edition), were added to the patient samples. Results from these spiked test patient samples were evaluated against that of the unspiked control sample. In accordance with CLSI EP07, interference testing was completed on patient serum samples containing four levels of procalcitonin at three clinically relevant concentrations of $0 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { \mathsf { n g / m L } }$ , 0.5 $\mathsf { n g } / \mathsf { m L }$ and $2 . 0 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and an additional procalcitonin concentration of approximately $8 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . See the interfering substance table below for the list of substances and interference concentrations tested.

The study was run at an internal site on three Access 2 instruments, using three reagent pack lots and one calibrator lot. Five replicates were tested for each control sample and each spiked test sample preparation.

Of the substances tested, none were found to cause significant interference, as defined by a change in concentration between the diluent control and test sample within $\pm 1 0 \%$ . The acceptance criteria of $\pm 1 0 \%$ was set to ensure that the potential for interference is sufficiently mitigated while accommodating the expected imprecision of the assay when performing interference testing.

Matrix Comparison: A comparison of forty-three (43) matched sets of serum gel, serum no gel, plasma lithium heparin, and plasma EDTA samples with procalcitonin concentrations ranging from approximately 0.19 to $8 6 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ were compared using Passing-Bablok linear regression analysis.

The observed linear fit for serum (gel) vs. serum (no gel) had an estimated slope $= 0 . 9 9$ with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval (CI) of 0.98 to 1.00. The observed linear fit for lithium heparin plasma vs. serum (no gel) had an estimated slope $= 0 . 9 6$ with a $9 5 \%$ CI of 0.95 to 0.97. The observed linear fit for EDTA plasma vs. serum (no gel) had an estimated slope of 1.03, with a $9 5 \%$ CI of 1.01 to 1.04. The observed linear fit for lithium heparin plasma vs. serum gel had an estimated slope of 0.97 with a $9 5 \%$ CI of 0.96 to 0.99. The observed linear fit of EDTA plasma vs. serum gel had an estimated slope $= 1 . 0 4$ with a $9 5 \%$ CI of 1.03 to 1.05. The observed linear fit of EDTA plasma vs. lithium heparin plasma had an estimated slope   
$= 1 . 0 6$ with a $9 5 \%$ CI of 1.05 to 1.08.

Carryover Study: The PCT assay utilizes a sodium hydroxide wash between tests to mitigate the potential occurrence of carryover. Based on the expectation that carryover is minimized by this design feature, the acceptance criteria of $\pm 1 0 \%$ was set to ensure that the potential for carryover is sufficiently mitigated while accommodating the expected imprecision of the assay when performing carryover testing.

Verification studies were performed to determine potential assay carryover for the Access PCT assay on the Access 2 instrument. The test used samples at $0 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { \mathsf { n g / m L } }$ and the medical decision points of $0 . 5 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $2 . 0 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Testing alternated low samples with high samples for each level tested and used a serum sample spiked with antigen and the highest calibrator. Testing met result criteria as all results had a shift of $\leq 1 0 \%$ for assay carryover.

Individual estimates of carryover ranged from $- 6 \%$ to $+ 8 \%$ and indicate no clear trend of positive or negative shifts. This observation provides additional evidence that the potential for carryover is sufficiently mitigated. If carryover of a high sample into a lower sample were present, we would expect to observe a positive bias only.

# Conclusion:
