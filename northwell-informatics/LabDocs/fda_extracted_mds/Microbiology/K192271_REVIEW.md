# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

A single site validation study was performed to determine the imprecision of the Access PCT assay using a protocol based on CLSI EP05- A3 (Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline – Third Edition).

The 10 member panel sample set, including 7 contrived serum levels and Bio-Rad Specialty

Lyphochek control levels 1, 2, and 3 were tested on three (3) reagent lots and three (3) calibrator lots. The samples were run at one external site on one Access 2 Immunoassay System and were run in replicates of 2 for a total of 20 days, with two (2) runs per day (separated by a minimum of two hours), for a total of 40 valid runs. Eighty (80) replicates were used for imprecision analysis according to CLSI EP05-A3. Two (2) calibration curves on three (3) calibrator lots and three (3) reagent pack lots were utilized during the 20 day precision study.

Total imprecision, within run imprecision (repeatability), between run, and between day variation was evaluated in terms of percent coefficient of variation, $\% \mathrm { C V }$ . The acceptance criteria for total imprecision is a standard deviation $( \mathrm { S D } ) { \le } 0 . 0 1 2$ for values $< 0 . 1 5 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and a $\mathrm { C V } \leq 8 . 0 \%$ for values $\ge 0 . 1 5 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Acceptance criteria for within run imprecision is $\mathrm { S D } \leq 0 . 0 0 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for values $< 0 . 1 5 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ & $C V \leq 6 \%$ for values $\ge 0 . 1 5 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

\*Values with 0 (0) indicate an Integer 0 was reported where the statistical model failed to result a valid variance estimate and assigned a nominal 0. We preserve its original form to differentiate nominal from numerical results.

The study demonstrated that Access PCT assay meet design input requirements for total imprecision on the Access 2 with an $\mathrm { S D } \le 0 . 0 1 2 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for values $< 0 . 1 5 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and a CV $\leq 8 . 0 \%$ for values $\ge 0 . 1 5 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The Access PCT assay also met the within run imprecision (repeatability) design input requirements with an $\mathrm { S D } \leq 0 . 0 0 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for values $< 0 . 1 5 0$ $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $\mathrm { C V } \leq 6 . 0 \%$ for values $\ge 0 . 1 5 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

The acceptance criteria established and demonstrated by the sponsor provides evidence that Access PCT is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

# 2. Linearity:

Two studies were performed to demonstrate the linearity of the Access PCT assay based on CLSI EP06-A, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach. The linearity study data was used to evaluate the percent recovery for spiked samples by evaluating known concentrations of procalcitonin in serum samples.

In both studies three Access 2 Immunoassay Systems were used, three reagent pack lots and one calibrator lot. Three quality controls were run in replicates of two on each day of testing to verify the system was in control.

In the study analyzing the full range of the assay, one high sample and one low sample were mixed to make nine sample concentrations evenly distributed across the analytical measuring range. Four replicates of the seven mixed samples, eight replicates of the low sample and four replicates of the high sample were tested. In addition to the high and low PCT concentration samples, seven mixtures were tested in this study. The low sample was run in replicates of eight, and all other samples were run in replicates of four.

In the study analyzing the low end of the assay range, one high sample and one low sample were mixed to make ten sample concentrations evenly distributed between $0 . 0 0 7 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and approximately $3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The low sample was run in replicates of eight, and all other samples were run in replicates of four.

The Access PCT assay demonstrated acceptable linearity throughout the analytical measuring range of $0 . 0 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ to approximately $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . The Access PCT assay was designed to be linear, with a maximum deviation from linearity of $\leq 1 0 \%$ for values $> 0 . 1 5 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $\leq$ $0 . 0 1 2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for values $\leq 0 . 1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

The data from the full assay range study was analyzed based on CLSI EP06-A using a weighted linear regression. The PCT linearity study was designed using 9 dilutions and was evaluated against the linearity specification $0 f \pm 1 0 \%$ . Analysis using all 9 dilutions resulted in some of the highest concentrations having non-linearity $> 1 0 \%$ . Per CLSI EP06-A: 2003 section 5.3.3, the high concentration point was removed, and linearity was re-assessed. The remaining samples used to evaluate linearity still cover the full measuring interval of the assay. All linearity results using the reduced 8 dilution point range met the linearity specification.

The obtained results are summarized in the table below:

In addition, the linearity data was analyzed to evaluate percent recovery for each intermediate mixture sample used for the linearity evaluation. The expected value for each sample was computed based on the observed concentration of the low sample, high spiked sample, and the proportion of each of the high and low samples in the mixture. Percent recovery was then calculated as the observed value for each sample as a proportion of the expected value. The observed range of percent recovery values was $9 4 \% - 1 1 2 \%$

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Potential cross-reactive substances were added to serum patient samples at three concentrations of procalcitonin (approximately $0 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , and $2 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ). Stock solutions of potential cross- reactants were prepared volumetrically using calibrated pipettes and the appropriate solvent. This stock solution was added directly to the serum in no more than $5 \%$ (v/v) final concentration. Control samples were prepared in the same manner using the solvent, without the cross-reactant added. Control and test samples were tested on the Access 2 instrument within 24 hours of preparation, using three reagent lots. Testing of human calcitonin, human katacalcin, human alpha CGRP and human beta CGRP, with Access PCT found that there is no significant cross-reactivity, as defined by a change in concentration between the diluent control and the test samples that is less than the expected within assay variability between samples.

Potential interfering substances were spiked into patient samples. Results from these spiked patient samples were evaluated against that of the unspiked sample. In accordance with CLSI EP07, third edition, interference testing was completed on patient serum samples containing four levels of procalcitonin at three clinically relevant concentrations of $0 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , 0.5 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $2 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and an additional procalcitonin concentration of approximately 80 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Potential interferents were tested at one concentration above therapeutic concentration range as directed by CLSI EP07, third edition. See Table 2 below for the list and concentrations of each interferent.

The acceptance criterion is defined as a change in concentration between the diluent control and the test sample within the variability expected between sample, which is $\pm 1 0 \%$ . No potential interference was found to exceed the acceptance criterion.

NOTE: Biotin interference was not evaluated since the Access PCT assay does not use biotin: streptavidin chemistry.

# Human Anti-mouse Antibody (HAMA)/ Rheumatoid Factor (RF) -

Testing of characterized HAMA/RF samples was performed to evaluate blocker effectiveness in the Access PCT assay. Native samples tested were serum and EDTA patient samples. Testing performed used three lots of reagent and three Access 2 instruments. Testing was completed on a “Control” reagent pack with the conjugate diluent and the reagent buffer containing blockers and a “Test” conjugate diluent and reagent buffer that did not contain blockers. The same lot of stock conjugate was used in the control and test for each of the reagent packs. One lot of conjugate diluent without blockers and one lot of reagent without blockers was used. All other reagent components (paramagnetic particles and NaOH) were matched for the control and test packs. One hundred eighteen (118) HAMA/RF samples were characterized by vendors as a specific type of interferent sample. All samples were tested in replicates of five on each of the three reagent pack lots (control and test).

“True interference” was defined as the percent difference between the control and the test pack which is greater than two times the within laboratory (total) imprecision requirement of the assay. Two times the total imprecision of the assay equals $\pm 1 6 \%$ for samples $\ge 0 . 1 5$ $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $\pm 0 . 0 2 4 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for samples below $0 . 1 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

The Access PCT reagent pack has been formulated to minimize the effects of HAMA/RF interference. Immunoenzymatic assay technology may demonstrate interferences from heterophile antibodies, including HAMA. While this assay has been formulated to minimize the effects of these antibodies, the following cautionary note has been included in the “Limitations of the Procedure” section of the product insert.

“For assays employing antibodies, the possibility exists for interference by heterophile antibodies in the patient sample. Patients who have been regularly exposed to animals or have received immunotherapy or diagnostic procedures utilizing immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments may produce human anti-animal antibodies, e.g., HAMA, that interfere with immunoassays. Additionally, other antibodies such as human anti-goat antibodies may be present in patient samples. Such interfering antibodies may cause erroneous results. Carefully evaluate the results of patients suspected of having these antibodies.”

“Other potential interferences in the patient sample could be present and may cause erroneous results in immunoassays. Some examples that have been documented in literature include rheumatoid factor, endogenous alkaline phosphatase, fibrin, and proteins capable of binding to alkaline phosphatase. Carefully evaluate results if the sample is suspected of having these types of interferences.”

# 4. Carryover

Verification studies were performed to determine potential assay carryover for the Access PCT assay on the Access 2 instrument. This testing used samples at $0 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and the medical decision points of $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ and $2 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ as the “low samples”. Serum samples spiked with the highest calibrator served as the “high samples”. Testing alternated five replicates of low samples, at each level, with two replicates of the high sample. Testing was performed over two days using one instrument and five reagent packs for each low sample level tested. Three commercial quality controls were run in duplicate on each day to verify the system was in control.

Results are in the table below.

In all cases, the shift between initial testing of target concentrations and testing of target concentrations after high concentrations was $< 1 0 \%$ , which is in within the inter sample variability of the assay and is therefore acceptable.

# 5. Assay Reportable Range:

The assay reportable range is the same as the predicate, $0 . 0 5 \mathrm { n g / m L } - 1 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$

6. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

# Sample Stability

The in vitro stability of procalcitonin antigen in serum gel, serum no-gel, lithium heparin plasma and EDTA plasma patient samples using Access PCT assay was characterized at one internal site to determine sample handling and storage conditions. All four sample types, serum gel, serum no gel, LiHep plasma and EDTA plasma, were obtained from individual donors with normal procalcitonin levels. Samples were prepared by spiking all four sample types obtained with recombinant PCT antigen to procalcitonin concentrations throughout the Access PCT measuring range. Samples were obtained from both internal and external sites.

The study was run on at least one reagent pack lot and two calibrator lots on two Access 2 immunoassay systems. Three quality controls were run in replicates of two on each day of each run to verify that the instrument was in control.

Parameters evaluated in the study include:

• Short-term stability at room temperature $2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ • Short-term stability at cooler temperature $2 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C }$ to $1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ • Short-term stability at freezer temperature $- 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $- 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ Sample Freeze/Thaw cycles stored at temperature $- 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $- 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

Short-term stability at room temperature $2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ was evaluated at 4 and 16 hours. One aliquot from each subject was tested immediately to determine baseline values (time 0). The remaining aliquots were stored at room temperature with one aliquot tested at each of the subsequent time points.

The sample handling study using serum and plasma samples with the Access PCT assay met the criterion at each storage condition. Patient samples can be stored for 16 hours at room temperature, 48 hours at 2 to $1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 75 days at $- 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $- 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and frozen (freeze/thaw) up to three times.

# Calibrators

The Access PCT Calibrators are a seven-level calibrator set intended to calibrate the Access PCT assay for the quantitative determination of procalcitonin levels in human serum and plasma using the Access Immunoassay Systems. The calibrators are provided at seven levels – zero and approximately 0.8, 5, 10, 25, 50, and $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . The calibrators contain a lyophilized HEPES buffer with protein (bovine serum albumin).

S0: Lyophilized HEPES buffer with protein (bovine), $\leq 0 . 1 ~ \%$ sodium azide, and $0 . 1 \%$ ProClin300

S1-S6: Recombinant human Procalcitonin at levels of approximately 0.8, 5, 10, 25, 50 and $1 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L ( \mu g / L ) }$ , respectively, in lyophilized HEPES buffer with protein (bovine), $\leq 0 . 1 \%$ sodium azide, and $0 . 1 \%$ ProClin 300

The Access PCT Calibrator kit contains one vial of each calibrator level and one Calibration Card. The S0-S6 calibrator vials contain lyophilized material. The calibrator vials are intended for storage at $2 \textrm { - } 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or colder. Once reconstituted, the $2 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ vial calibrators are stable at $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 4 hours, or 90 days at $- 3 0$ to $- 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and can be frozen and thawed up to 3 times.

Calibration cards are provided with each calibrator kit. Calibration cards contain bar codes that are encrypted with the individual calibrator concentrations for each calibrator level.

7. Limit of Blank (LoB), Detection (LoD) and Quantitation $\underline { { ( \mathrm { L o Q } ) } }$ : Studies were performed to determine the LoB, LoD and LoQ in the Access PCT assay using a protocol based on CLSI EP17-A2 (Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline – Second Edition).

# LoB

Three Access PCT S0 calibrator lots and one lot of Access Wash Buffer II were used for the LoB determination. One hundred (120) total replicates for each reagent pack lot were tested across two instruments (60 per instrument). LoB was calculated for each reagent pack lot. Of the total replicates, per reagent pack lot, ninety (90) were comprised of S0 calibrators (30 replicates of each of three lots) and thirty (30) were comprised of Access Wash Buffer II that were measured for the LoB determination. LoB was evaluated on one calibrator lot. Two Access 2 instruments and three reagent lots were used in the study design. Three days of testing were performed evaluating five replicates of each of the zero analyte sample. Three quality controls were run in replicates of two on each day to verify the systems were in control. The LoB was determined using the $9 5 \%$ non-parametric percentile of the 120 replicates for each of three evaluations. The results of this study demonstrate that the Access PCT assay met the acceptance criterion of $\leq 0 . 0 0 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# LoD

The study was run on one Access 2 Immunoassay Systems, using three reagent lots and one calibrator lot. For estimation of LoD, ten serum samples, ten lithium heparin plasma, and ten EDTA plasma samples containing low levels of procalcitonin analyte were measured. One run per day, approximately nine replicates per run were performed on each day of testing, resulting in a maximum of forty-five replicates for each instrument/pack lot combination. Three quality controls were run in replicates of two on each day to verify the systems were in control. The LoD was determined by fitting the precision profile model between within-lab standard deviation (SD) and concentration. The SD, which was based on the precision model, was multiplied by the 95th percentile of the standard normal distribution and added to the LoB to calculate the LoD per CLSI EP17-A2. The results of this study demonstrate that the Access PCT met the acceptance criterion of $\leq 0 . 0 1 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

#

As indicated in CLSI EP17-A2, in situations where bias cannot be determined, within-laboratory precision is used as the sole acceptance goal. Bias is defined as the difference between the expectation of the test results and an accepted reference value, which is not available for the PCT analyte. Therefore, the LoQ approach outlined in CLSI EP17-A2 based upon a precision profile experiment in the lowend region of the measuring interval was used for the Access PCT assay. This method used three Access 2 Immunoassay Systems in the study design with three reagent lots and one calibrator lot. For estimation of LoQ, approximately ten native serum samples, ten native EDTA (plasma) samples, and ten native lithium heparin (plasma) containing low levels of procalcitonin analyte were prepared. Samples were tested over five days, one run per day, 9 replicates per run, for each pack lot. This resulted in a maximum of 45 replicates for each sample on each pack lot tested. Three quality controls were run in replicates of two on each day to verify the systems were in control. A variance components model was used to estimate the within- run and within-laboratory (total) $\% C V$ for each sample on each instrument and reagent lot combination. A log-log quadratic precision profile model was fitted to within- laboratory (total) $\% \mathrm { C V }$ versus observed sample mean. The fitted precision profile was used to calculate the $20 \%$ CV LoQ. The acceptance criteria are $20 \%$ CV at $\leq 0 . 0 2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The results of this study demonstrate that the Access PCT assay met the acceptance criterion of a $\mathrm { L o Q \leq }$ $0 . 0 2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# B Clinical Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

Method concordance (agreement) results to VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT were used to establish positive and negative agreement at clinical decision points $( 0 . 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $2 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ).

Method comparison samples were residual serum samples from standard of care PCT testing obtained from vendors’ specific SOPs with IRB/EC waiver of informed consent.

On the Access 2, among the 238 samples, 2 samples were reported as over the Access PCT measuring range $\left( > 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } \right)$ and 18 samples were reported below IVD VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT measurable range $( < 0 . 0 5 \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ . The 20 samples that were outside either assay’s measuring range were excluded from analyses. Five samples were excluded based on visual sample quality observation after thawing. Additionally, 3 samples were not tested on the VIDAS instrument. Therefore, a total of 207 samples with paired Access PCT and VIDAS $\mathrm { B } { \cdot } \mathrm { R } { \cdot } \mathrm { A } { \cdot } \mathrm { H } { \cdot } \mathrm { M } { \cdot } \mathrm { S }$ PCT measurements were included for analyses. Distribution of PCT levels for the 207 samples, as measured by the VIDAS B·R·A·H·M·S PCT assay, were:

After daily maintenance, the IUO Access PCT assay was calibrated on all instruments and reagent lots as required for study testing. After a passing calibration curve was obtained, the site performed daily QC using Bio-Rad Specialty Lyphochek QC material. If QC met acceptance criteria, the site performed method comparison and method concordance.

The percent agreement and corresponding $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals (CI) for each clinical decision point (0.5 and $2 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ) are presented in the two tables below. The number of samples that agree or disagree according to the clinical decision points are indicated.
