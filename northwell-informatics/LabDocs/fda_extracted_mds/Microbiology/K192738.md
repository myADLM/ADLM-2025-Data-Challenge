Re: K192738 Trade/Device Name: ETEST Delafloxacin (DFX) $( 0 . 0 0 2 { - } 3 2 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ Regulation Number: 21 CFR 866.1640 Regulation Name: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Powder Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: JWY Dated: September 26, 2019 Received: September 27, 2019

Dear Sophie Quiblier:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part

801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

C. Predicate Device:

ETEST® Delafloxacin; ETEST® DFX ETEST® Telavancin (TLA) $( 0 . 0 0 2 - 3 2 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ (K180936)

# D. Device Description:

ETEST® is a thin, inert and non-porous plastic strip carrying on one side the MIC reading scale in $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ , and on the other side a predefined antibiotic gradient.

When the strip is applied to an inoculated agar surface, the preformed antibiotic gradient immediately transfers into the agar matrix, then forming a stable, continuous and exponential gradient of antibiotic concentrations directly underneath the strip. Bacterial growth becomes visible during incubation, and a symmetrical inhibition ellipse centered along the strip appears. The MIC value is read from the scale in terms of $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ at complete inhibition of bacterial growth, where the pointed end of the ellipse intersects the strip.

ETEST® Delafloxacin contains a range of delafloxacin from 0.002 to $3 2 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$

# E. Intended Use:

ETEST® is a manual, quantitative technique for determination of antimicrobial susceptibility of non-fastidious Gram-negative and Gram-positive aerobic bacteria and fastidious bacteria. The system comprises a predefined antibiotic gradient which is used to determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC, in $\mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m L } )$ of different antimicrobial agents against microorganisms tested on agar media after overnight incubation.

Delafloxacin has been shown to be active against the aerobic microorganisms listed below according to the FDA label for this antimicrobial agent.

ETEST® DFX can be used to determine the MIC of Delafloxacin against the following microorganisms:

Active both in vitro and in clinical infections:

Gram-positive bacteria:

• Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible strains)   
• Staphylococcus haemolyticus   
• Staphylococcus lugdunensis   
• Enterococcus faecalis

Gram-negative bacteria: • Pseudomonas aeruginosa

# G. Performance Overview

ETEST® Delafloxacin (DFX) (0.002-32 $\mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m L } )$ demonstrated substantially equivalent performance when compared with the CLSI M07-A11 January 2018 broth microdilution reference method, following rules as defined in the FDA Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA, issued on August 28, 2009 and following specifications as defined in CLSI M100-S29 January 2019.

This Premarket Notification $( 5 1 0 [ \mathbf { k } ] )$ presents data in support of ETEST® Delafloxacin (DFX) $( 0 . 0 0 2 { - } 3 2 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ for: Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant and methicillinsusceptible strains), Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

External evaluations were conducted with fresh and stock clinical isolates, as well as a set of challenge strains. The external evaluations were designed to establish the performance of ETEST® Delafloxacin (DFX) $( 0 . 0 0 2 { - } 3 2 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ by comparing with the CLSI broth microdilution reference method.

ETEST® Delafloxacin (DFX) $( 0 . 0 0 2 { - } 3 2 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ ) demonstrated acceptable performance as presented in Table 1 below:

Reproducibility and Quality Control demonstrated acceptable results.

# Notes:

a) $\mathrm { E A } = \%$ of MIC values within $\pm \nobreakspace 1 \nobreakspace$ dilution of the reference method.

b) The optional inoculator and $\mathrm { E T E S T } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ strip applicator can be used for plate inoculation and applying ETEST® strips onto agar media. In the ETEST® Delafloxacin clinical studies, swabs and the Inoculator RETRO $\mathrm { C 8 0 ^ { r M } }$ were used for plate inoculation/streaking and forceps and the Vacuum Pen NEMA $\mathrm { C 8 8 ^ { r m } }$ were used for $\mathrm { E T E S } \mathbf { \dot { T } } ^ { \textcircled { \times } }$ strip application.

c) ETEST® Delafloxacin MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or one doubling dilution higher when testing Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis compared to the reference broth microdilution method.

d) Category Agreement is not calculated because Delafloxacin breakpoints for S. lugdunensis were not established by the FDA.
