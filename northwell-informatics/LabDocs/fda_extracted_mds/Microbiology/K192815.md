# 1. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay is a two-step sandwich immunoassay with streptavidin microparticles, biotinylated antibody and antibody labeled with ruthenium as well as an electrochemiluminescence detection system. Procalcitonin (PCT) in the sample reacts with these labeled antibodies to form a sandwich complex. This complex binds to streptavidin coated magnetic microparticles, which are magnetically captured onto an electrode. Application of voltage to the electrode induces chemiluminescence which is measured by a photomultiplier tube. Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument-specifically generated by 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode. An optional Procalcitonin CalCheck product is also available.

# 1.1. Reagents

The reagent working solutions include:

Rackpack (kit placed on analyzer)

● M: Streptavidin-coated microparticles, ● R1: Anti-PCT-Ab\~biotin ● R2: Anti-PCT-Ab\~Ru(bpy)₃²⁺

The following change is proposed to block the interference of biotin with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay. Briefly, Roche is taking a one-step approach by adding an antibody to bind free biotin in the sample. For the neutralization of free biotin in serum and plasma, Roche developed an antibody which binds to free biotin. The antibodies are specific for free biotin and do not bind to, or interact with, the biotin-linker conjugates.

# 2. INDICATIONS FOR USE

# 4.2. Sample Matrix Comparison

The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of anticoagulants with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT immunoassay was determined by comparing values obtained from samples (native human serum samples, single donors as well as pools) drawn into serum and Li-Heparin, K2-EDTA, K3-EDTA plasma tubes. A minimum of 40 serum/plasma pairs per sample material were tested in singleton with one reagent lot on one cobas e 601 analyzer. Data were evaluated using a regression analysis according to Passing/Bablok.

# 4.3. Endogenous Interferences

The effect on quantitation of PCT in the presence of five endogenous interfering substances (Hemoglobin, Biotin, Intralipid, Bilirubin, and Rheumatoid Factor) was tested using one cobas e 601 analyzer. Spiked serum pools were used for testing. The substances were found not to affect test performance at clinically relevant concentrations. Recovery was within $\pm 1 5 \%$ of the initial value for PCT concentrations $> 0 . 1 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and within $0 . 0 1 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for concentrations below 0.1 ng/mL

The specificity of the Elecsys $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ BRAHMS PCT was determined using native human serum samples spiked with potential cross-reactant compounds.

The samples were tested on a cobas e 601 Immunoassay Analyzer. Recovery within $\pm 1 5 \%$ of initial value at PCT concentrations of $\mathrm { \sim } 0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and ${ \sim } 2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ were verified for the following cross-reactant concentrations:

● $3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ human katacalcin $1 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ human calcitonin $1 0 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ human alpha-CGRP $1 0 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ human beta-CGRP $3 0 0 0 0 { \mathrm { n g / m L } }$ Calcitonin Salmon   
● $3 0 0 0 0 { \mathrm { n g / m L } }$ Calcitonin Eel

# 4.6. Reagent On-Board Stability

A fresh Elecsys BRAHMS PCT test kit was placed on the cobas e 601 analyzer and calibrated. Reference values for the samples tested were determined (day 0). After 8, 15, 22 and 29 days (1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks) the same samples were measured with the same reagent kit kept under onboard condition. Re-calibration was performed at every measuring time point.

Samples tested include eight (8) human serum (HS) sample pools. Each sample was tested in two-fold determination. Samples were targeted with values near medical decision levels of 0.1 ng/mL, $0 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ and $2 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ as one sample range, along with sample ranges at low, medium and high PCT concentration ranges relative to the measuring range. Mean recovery values for each sample range were calculated. Elecsys BRAHMS PCT reagent kits can be kept on board of the instruments for up to 4 weeks (28 days). A new calibration of the kit kept

on board is recommended every 7 days.

# 4.7. Calibration Stability

The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was calibrated with a fresh reagent kit on Day 0 using one cobas e 601 analyzer. After 3, 6, and 9 weeks a new reagent kit of the same lot was used with recovery of samples being determined using the calibration curve established on Day 0 for that reagent kit lot. Forteen (14) human serum samples were tested in duplicate. Recovery compared to the reference value was calculated as absolute deviation in $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ or relative deviation in $\%$ . Samples were targeted with values near medical decision levels of $0 . 1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $0 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , 0.5 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $2 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ along with samples spread across the measuring range. Mean recovery values for each sample range were calculated. The resulting data support the package-insert claim of 8 weeks lot calibration stability when using the same reagent kit lot.

# 4.8. LoQ according to CLSI EP17-A2

The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was determined according to CLSI EP17-A2. The LoQ represents the lowest amount of analyte that can be quantitatively determined with stated accuracy, precision, and experimental conditions. The LoQ was calculated based on intermediate precision according to CLSI EP17-A2. The LoQ was determined as the lowest concentration of analyte that can be quantified with an intermediate precision of no more than $20 \%$ .

A five-day LoQ experiment was carried out with one reagent lot on one cobas e 601 analyzer. Samples tested included seven native human serum (HS) samples and were measured in five-fold determination for each run. A total of 150 measuring points were collected.

The mean values and the intermediate precision (coefficient of variation and standard deviation) for each LoQ sample were calculated. To determine the LoQ, samples were sorted according to the concentration of their measured mean value. The LoQ is defined as the mean value of the

sample that is first to fulfill the specification for intermediate precision, and for which there is no lower-concentration sample that exceeds the specification. The LoQ data are represented in the table below.

# 4.9. Clinical Performance Evaluation - Method Comparison to Predicate

A method comparison of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay and the predicate was performed using 496 native serum human clinical samples. A concordance analysis was performed with the predicate device. Only samples in which the result from the candidate and the predicate device were within the measuring range were included in the concordance analysis. The clinical concordance analysis of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT clinical performance study shows more than $9 6 \%$ total agreement between the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT and the predicate device at the medical decision points 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and $2 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The regression slopes are within $+ / - 1 0 \%$ of identity in Passing-Bablok and Weighted Deming Analysis. This demonstrates equivalence to the predicate device to include all currently cleared claims of the predicate device in the labeling of the candidate device.

Further clinical performance study data can be found referenced in K173927 and K160729.
