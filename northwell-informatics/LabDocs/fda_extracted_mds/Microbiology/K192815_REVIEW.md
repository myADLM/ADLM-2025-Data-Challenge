# II Submission/Device Overview:

# A Purpose for Submission:

The purpose of this Traditional 510(k) Premarket Notification is to obtain FDA clearance for new reagents which have been added to the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT Test System. Additional reagents intended to minimize potentially interfering effects of biotin in a patient specimen have been added to the previously cleared product.

# B Measurand:

Procalcitonin (PCT)

# C Type of Test:

Quantitative, Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay

III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

Immunoassay for the in vitro quantitative determination of PCT (procalcitonin) in human serum and plasma (K2 –EDTA, K3-EDTA and Li-Heparin).

The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” is intended for use on cobas e immunoassay analyzers.

Used in conjunction with other laboratory findings and clinical assessments, Elecsys BRAHMS PCT is intended for use as follows:

• to aid in the risk assessment of critically ill patients on their first day of ICU admission for progression to severe sepsis and septic shock, to determine the change in PCT level over time as an aid in assessing the cumulative 28-day risk of all-cause mortality for patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock in the ICU or when obtained in the emergency department or other medical wards prior to ICU admission, to aid in decision making on antibiotic therapy, for inpatients or patients in the emergency department with suspected or confirmed lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) – defined as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute bronchitis, and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD),   
• to aid in decision making on antibiotic discontinuation for patients with suspected or confirmed sepsis.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

Warnings and Precautions

The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT is not indicated to be used as a stand-alone diagnostic assay and should be used in conjunction with clinical signs and symptoms of infection and other diagnostic evidence. In cases where the laboratory results do not agree with the clinical picture or history, additional tests should be

performed. Changes in PCT should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical status of the patient and other laboratory results. Decisions regarding antibiotic therapy should NOT be based solely on procalcitonin concentrations.

There is no uniformly recognized interpretation of the change in PCT concentration levels for the prediction of mortality, and overall mortality is strongly dependent on many factors, including preexisting patient risk factors and clinical course. The need to continue ICU care at Day 4 and other covariates (e.g., age, SOFA score) are also significant predictors of 28 day cumulative mortality risk. Validation of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT test as an aid in predicting mortality was performed in a study population with an overall 28 day mortality of $22 \%$ .

Certain patient characteristics, such as severity of renal failure or insufficiency, may influence procalcitonin values and should be considered as potentially confounding clinical factors when interpreting PCT values. Increased PCT levels may be observed in severe illness such as polytrauma, burns, major surgery, prolonged or cardiogenic shock. PCT levels may not be elevated in patients infected by certain atypical pathogens, such as Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The safety and performance of PCT-guided therapy for individuals younger than age 17 years, pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals or those on immunomodulatory agents, was not formally analyzed in the supportive clinical trials.

# D Special Instrument Requirements:

The submission demonstrates performance on the cobas e 601 immunoassay analyzer.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay is intended for use with the cobas e immunoassay analyzers, PCT Cal1 and Cal2 reagents, and the PreciControl PCT1 and PCT2 as part of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT Kit. An optional Procalcitonin CalCheck product is also available.

# B Principle of Operation:

The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay is a two-step sandwich immunoassay with streptavidin microparticles, biotinylated antibody and antibody labeled with ruthenium as well as an electrochemiluminescence detection system. Procalcitonin (PCT) in the sample reacts with these labeled antibodies to form a sandwich complex. This complex binds to streptavidin coated magnetic microparticles, which are magnetically captured onto an electrode. Application of voltage to the electrode induces chemiluminescence which is measured by a photomultiplier tube. Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument-specifically generated by 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode.

Total duration of assay: 18 minutes.

1st incubation: Antigen in the sample $( 3 0 \mu \mathrm { L } )$ , a biotinylated monoclonal PCT-specific antibody, and a monoclonal PCT-specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium complex\*) react to form a sandwich complex. 2nd incubation: After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin.   
• The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then removed with ProCell M. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier. Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument-specifically generated by 2- point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode.

(\*):Tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II)-complex $( \mathrm { R u ( b p y ) } _ { 3 } \mathrm { ^ { 2 + } } )$

# C Reagents

The reagent working solutions include:

Rackpack (kit placed on analyzer)

• M: Streptavidin-coated microparticles, • R1: Anti-PCT-Ab\~biotin • R2: Anti-PCT-Ab\~Ru(bpy)₃²⁺

The following change is proposed to block the interference of biotin with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay: Roche is taking a one-step approach by adding an antibody to bind free biotin in the sample. For the neutralization of free biotin in serum and plasma, Roche developed an antibody which binds to free biotin. The antibodies are specific for free biotin and do not bind to, or interact with, the biotin-linker conjugates.

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility:

The repeatability and intermediate precision of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was conducted using the cobas e 601 analyzer. Studies were performed in accordance with CLSI guideline EP5-A3, “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods”. One reagent lot was evaluated. The precision study was conducted using the study design of 21 days x 2 runs per day x 2 replicates per sample. One (1) instrument was used for the study and calibration was performed according to the Instructions for Use. Aliquots of seven (7) human serum samples and two (2) QC samples (PC PCT 1 and PC PCT 2) distributed over the measuring range were assayed in duplicate and randomized order on the cobas e 601 analyzer using one lot of reagent. Data is summarized in Table 1 below. An analysis was also performed to calculate $\%$ Total Error across the measuring range. The total error was calculated using the one-sided Westgard-Model as:

$$
\mathrm { T E } = 1 . 6 5 ^ { * } \mathrm { C V } + \% \mathrm { b i a s }
$$

The $\% \mathrm { C V }$ used corresponds to the intermediate precision.

# Endogenous Interferences

The effect on quantitation of PCT in the presence of five endogenous interfering substances (Hemoglobin, Biotin, Intralipid, Bilirubin, and Rheumatoid Factor) was tested using one cobas e 601 analyzer at clinically relevant concentrations. One aliquot of each serum sample was spiked with the interfering substance, another aliquot was spiked with the same volume of the respective solvent (dilution pool). The interfering pool was then incrementally diluted into the dilution pool. The recovery for each sample was calculated by comparison to the analyte concentration of the respective dilution pools.

The following substances evaluated with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay were found not to affect the test performance at concentrations reasonably and consistently found in clinical situations.

Sample Stability

Please refer to previously FDA-cleared 510(k) K160729 and K173927 for Sample Stability Effect performance. No additional testing was conducted.

# Reagent On-Board Stability

A fresh Elecsys BRAHMS PCT test kit was placed on the cobas e 601 analyzer and calibrated. Reference values for the samples tested were determined (day 0). After 8, 15, 22 and 29 days (1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks) the same samples were measured with the same reagent kit kept under on- board condition. Re-calibration was performed at every measuring time point.

Samples tested include eight (8) human serum (HS) sample pools. Each sample was tested in twofold determination. Samples were targeted with values near medical decision levels of $0 . 1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $0 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ and $2 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ as one sample range, along with sample ranges at low, medium and high PCT concentration ranges relative to the measuring range. Mean recovery values for each sample range were calculated. Elecsys BRAHMS PCT reagent kits can be kept on board of the instruments for up to 4 weeks (28 days). A new calibration of the kit kept on board is recommended every 7 days.

# Calibration Stability

The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was calibrated with a fresh reagent kit on Day 0 using one cobas e 601 analyzer. After 3, 6, and 9 weeks a new reagent kit of the same lot was used with recovery of samples being determined using the calibration curve established on Day 0 for that reagent kit lot. Fourteen (14) human serum samples were tested in duplicate. Recovery compared to the reference value was calculated as absolute deviation in $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ or relative deviation in $\%$ . Samples were targeted with values near medical decision levels of $0 . 1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $0 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ and $2 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ along with samples spread across the measuring range. Mean recovery values for each sample range were calculated. The resulting data support the package-insert claim of 8 weeks lot calibration stability when using the same reagent kit lot.

7. Detection Limit:

# Limit of Detection

Please refer to previously FDA-cleared 510(k) K160729 and K173927 for Limit of Detection performance. No additional testing was conducted.

# Limit of Quantitation

The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was determined according to CLSI EP17-A2. The LoQ represents the lowest amount of analyte that can be quantitatively determined with stated accuracy, precision, and experimental conditions. The LoQ was calculated based on intermediate precision according to CLSI EP17-A2. The LoQ was determined as the lowest concentration of analyte that can be quantified with an intermediate precision of no more than $20 \%$ .

A five-day LoQ experiment was carried out with one reagent lot on one cobas e 601 analyzer. Samples tested included seven native human serum (HS) samples and were measured in five-fold determination for each run. A total of 150 measuring points were collected.

The mean values and the intermediate precision (coefficient of variation and standard deviation) for each LoQ sample were calculated. To determine the LoQ, samples were sorted according to the concentration of their measured mean value. The LoQ is defined as the mean value of the sample that is first to fulfill the specification for intermediate precision, and for which there is no lowerconcentration sample that exceeds the specification. The LoQ data are represented in the table below.

# Limit of Blank

Please refer to previously FDA-cleared 510(k) K160729 and K173927 for Limit of Blank performance. No additional testing was conducted.

# 8. Assay Cut-Off:

28-day mortality:

• ΔPCT ≤ 80%

A decrease in the PCT levels below or equal to $80 \%$ defines a positive ΔPCT test result representing a higher risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock.

$\Delta \mathrm { P C T } > 8 0 \%$

A decrease in the PCT levels of more than $80 \%$ defines a negative $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ test result representing a lower risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock.

NOTE: The combination of the first PCT level $( \leq 2 . 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ or $> 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ) at initial diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock with the patient’s clinical course and the change in PCT level over time until Day 4 provides important additional information about the mortality risk.

# Progression Risk:

• $\mathbf { P C T } > 2 \ \mathbf { \mu g / L }$ A PCT level above $2 . 0 \mu \mathrm { g / L }$ on the first day of ICU admission is associated with a high risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock. $\mathbf { P C T < 0 . 5 \mu g / L }$ A PCT level below $0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { g / L }$ on the first day of ICU admission is associated with a low risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.

# LRTI Antibiotic Decision Making:

• $\mathbf { P C T < 0 . 1 0 \ n g / m L }$ Antibiotic therapy strongly discouraged.   
• PCT 0.10-0.25 ng/mL Antibiotic therapy discouraged.   
• PCT 0.26-0.50 ng/mL Antibiotic therapy encouraged. $\mathbf { P C T > 0 . 5 0 \ n g / m L }$ Antibiotic therapy strongly encouraged.

Sepsis Antibiotic Discontinuation:

• $\Delta \mathrm { P C T } > 8 0 \%$ Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued   
• $\mathbf { P C T \le 0 . 5 0 \ n g / m L }$ Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued

Recommendations for Laboratory Reports for Initiation and Discontinuation:

The Change in Procalcitonin Calculator is available at http://www.brahms-pct-calculator.com. The Change in Procalcitonin Calculator can be used to determine ΔPCT results. It is suggested to report the numerical PCT values (individual or paired). For paired PCT values the report should also indicate if the $\Delta P C \mathrm { T } ( \% )$ was $\leq 8 0 \%$ or $> 8 0 \%$ . The laboratory report should include a reference or a link to the package insert for a guided interpretation of the test results.

# B Comparison Studies:

# 1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A method comparison of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay and the predicate was performed using 496 native serum human clinical samples. A concordance analysis was performed with the predicate device. Only samples in which the result from the candidate and the predicate device were within the measuring range were included in the concordance analysis. The clinical concordance analysis of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT clinical performance study shows more than $9 6 \%$ total agreement between the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT and the predicate device at the medical decision points 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 2.0 K192815 - Page 16 of 20 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The regression slopes are within $+ / - 1 0 \%$ of identity in Passing-Bablok and Weighted Deming Analysis. This demonstrates equivalence to the predicate device to include all currently cleared claims of the predicate device in the labeling of the candidate device.

Further clinical performance study data can be found referenced in K173927 and K160729.

# 2. Matrix Comparison:

The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of anticoagulants with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT immunoassay was determined by comparing values obtained from samples (native human serum samples, single donors as well as pools) drawn into serum and Li-Heparin, K2-EDTA, K3-EDTA plasma tubes. A minimum of 40 serum/plasma pairs per sample material were tested in singleton with one reagent lot on one cobas e 601 analyzer. Data were evaluated using a regression analysis according to Passing/Bablok.

The results are acceptable and supports the following package-insert claim:

• SST is an acceptable sample type for use with the Elecsys PCT assay • Li-Heparin plasma is an acceptable sample type for use with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay • K2-EDTA plasma is an acceptable sample type for use with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay. • K3-EDTA plasma is an acceptable sample type for use with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay.
