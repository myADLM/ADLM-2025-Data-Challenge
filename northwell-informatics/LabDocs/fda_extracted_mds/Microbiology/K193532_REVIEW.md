# II Submission/Device Overview:

# A Purpose for Submission:

For addition of a new instrument family per FDA Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy; the LIAISION XS Analyzer.

# B Measurand:

Total antibodies to Hepatitis A Virus (Anti-HAV)

# C Type of Test:

Competitive Chemiluminescent Immunoassay

III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The LIAISON $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Anti-HAV assay is an in vitro chemiluminescent immunoassay intended for the qualitative detection of total antibodies to hepatitis A (anti-HAV) in human serum and sodium heparin plasma samples using the LIAISON $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Analyzer family. The assay is indicated as an aid in the laboratory diagnosis of current or previous HAV infections in conjunction with other serological and clinical information and to determine the presence of an antibody response to HAV in vaccine recipients.

This assay is not intended for screening blood or solid or soft tissue donors.

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Rx - For Prescription Use Only

# D Special Instrument Requirements:

For use with the LIAISON, LIAISON XL, or the LIAISON XS Analyzer.

# IV Device/System Characteristics: A Device Description:

The LIAISON Anti-HAV assay is an in vitro chemiluminescent immunoassay intended for the qualitative detection of total antibodies to hepatitis A (anti-HAV) in human serum and sodium heparin plasma samples using the LIAISON Analyzer family. No changes were made to the assay to run it on the LIAISON XS Analyzer (see K082049, K103529).

# B Principle of Operation:

The LIAISON Anti-HAV assay is a competitive sandwich chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) based on neutralization. The assay uses magnetic particles (solid phase) coated with IgG antibodies to HAV (mouse monoclonal), and a mouse monoclonal anti-HAV antibody conjugate linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-antibody conjugate). The first incubation step consists of adding the HAV antigen to calibrators, samples or controls, during which anti-HAV present in calibrators, samples or controls binds to a fixed and limited amount of HAV, thus forming an HAV-anti-HAV immune complex. In the next step magnetic microparticles and conjugate are added into the cuvette. During this incubation the antibody conjugate and the solidphase antibody compete with anti-HAV present in the specimen for HAV which allows the

conjugate to bind to the solid phase and form a sandwich. If all HAV added is sequestered in an HAV-anti-HAV immune complex during the first incubation, no sandwich is formed during the second incubation. After the second incubation, the unbound material is removed with a wash cycle. Subsequently, the starter reagents are added and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is induced. The light signal, proportional to the amount of isoluminol-antibody conjugate, is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is inversely relative to the antiHAV present in samples, calibrators, or controls.

The LIAISON XS Analyzer is a benchtop, automated, closed, continuous samples and reagentsloading in vitro diagnostic immunoassay system utilizing chemiluminescent technology to provide rapid sample results. The LIAISON XS Analyzer has the same basic design, performance characteristics, intended use, and function as the LIAISON XL Analyzer, employing the same chemiluminescent reaction measurement technology and Reagent Integrals.

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

A reproducibility/precision study was conducted at two external laboratories and at DiaSorin Inc. (Stillwater, Minnesota 55082-0285, U.S.A.) to verify the precision of the LIAISON XS Analyzer with the LIAISON XS Anti-HAV Assay.

A coded panel comprised of 7 frozen serum samples was distributed to the testing sites. The coded panel samples were prepared by pooling samples with similar anti-HAV titers in order to represent negative, borderline and positive levels. The LIAISON Anti-HAV controls were also included in the twelve-day study. The coded panel was tested at all three sites, in a single run, four replicates per day, with one reagent lot, at least two operators per site, for 12 days.

The mean Index value, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation $( \% C V )$ of the results were computed for each of the tested specimens for each of the sites and across sites.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods): See K082049

6. Detection Limit/Analytical Sensitivity:

An analytical sensitivity study was performed using a secondary standard titrated against the WHO International Standard for Anti-Hepatitis A, Immunoglobulin, Human. The study was performed to demonstrate that the minimum level of analyte detected was comparable between the assay run on the LIAISON XL vs on the LIAISON XS. Results obtained from serial dilutions of the secondary standard tested with the LIAISON Anti-HAV on the LIAISON XS were plotted. The concentration at the assay cutoff, corresponding to the assay analytical sensitivity, was calculated by interpolation and the mean value obtained was 18 mIU/mL. The result fell within the acceptance range of $1 5 . 5 - 2 1 . 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ , which is the same criteria for the assay on the LIAISON XL.

9. Carry-Over:

Not indicated. The LIAISON XS analyzer utilizes the same pipetting technology as the LIAISON XL analyzer.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A Method Comparison study was conducted to demonstrate equivalent performance of the LIAISON Anti-HAV assay when run on either the LIAISON XL or the LIAISON XS analyzer. The study consisted of testing 100 frozen serum samples on the LIAISON XS and the LIAISON XL Analyzers with the LIAISON Anti-HAV Assay. The samples were either selected or prepared by DiaSorin Inc. to reach different levels of anti-HAV antibody.

The samples were randomly divided among 3 sites (2 external and 1 internal) for testing, with testing on the LIAISON XL Analyzer performed internally at DiaSorin Inc.
