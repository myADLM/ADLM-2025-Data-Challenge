# 510(k) Summary

This 510(k) Summary is being submitted in accordance with the requirement of SMDA 1990 and 21 CFR 807.92.

1) Submitter’s Name: Gold Standard Diagnostics Address: 2851 Spafford St. Davis, CA. 95618 Phone Number: 530-759-8000 Contact Person: Napoleon Monce Date: December 27, 2019

2) Product and Trade Name: Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgM ELISA Test Kit

Common Name: Lyme ELISA Test

Regulation Section: 21 CFR 866.3830; Treponema pallidum treponemal test reagents.

Classification: Class II

Product Code: LSR; Reagent, Borrelia Serological Reagent

3) Legally Marketed Device to Which the Submitter Claims Equivalence: Trinity Biotech MarDx Borrelia burgdorferi EIA IgM Test Kit (K894293).

# 4) Description of the Device:

The kit includes $1 2 \times 8$ well Antigen Coated strips, Conjugate, Substrate, Stop Solution, Wash Buffer, Diluent, Negative Control, Positive Control, and Cutoff Control. The controls are provided to determine if the assay is functioning properly and to determine the antibody level. The reagents are sufficient for 96 determinations.

During the test procedure, antibodies to $B _ { \cdot }$ . burgdorferi (sensu stricto) if present in the human serum sample will bind to the antigens coated onto the wells forming antigen-antibody complexes. Excess antibodies are removed by washing. A conjugate of goat anti-human IgM antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase is then added, which binds to the antigenantibody complexes. Excess conjugate is removed by washing. This is followed by the addition of a chromogenic substrate, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). If specific antibodies to the antigen are present in the patients’ serum, a blue color will develop. The enzymatic reaction is then stopped with a stopping solution causing the contents of the well to turn yellow. The wells are read photometrically with a microplate reader at $4 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .

The antigens used in the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgM ELISA Test kit is a combination of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31 lysate, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain 2591 lysate, and a recombinant VlsE protein from $B$ . burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31. The lysates use spirochetes growing in BSK-H complete medium until mid-exponential phase. The recombinant VlsE protein is produced in $E$ . coli SURE2 cells and purified by affinity chromatography.

# 5) Intended Use of the Device:

The Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgM ELISA Test kit is intended as a qualitative presumptive (first step) test for the detection of IgM antibodies to $B$ . burgdorferi sensu stricto in human serum from symptomatic patients or people suspected of infection. Positive and equivocal results must be supplemented by testing with a second-step Western blot assay.

# 6(b1): Nonclinical Studies:

# Determination of the Assay Cutoff

The cutoff was determined by testing a total of 208 normal sera which consisted of 103 sera from an endemic region of Lyme disease and 105 sera from a non-endemic region of Lyme disease. The mean plus two standard deviations was used to determine the assay cutoff. A known positive sample was then diluted to produce a ready to use cutoff control. An additional 194 samples consisting of 114 samples from different phases of Lyme disease, 8 negative healthy samples, 72 negative Lyme disease samples but do have other diseases that may cause serologic cross-reactivity, were tested. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the performance of the assay and confirm that the chosen cutoff provided the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity.

# Precision

To determine the precision of the Borrelia burgdorferi IgM ELISA Test, a within-lab precision study was conducted. A precision panel consisting of a negative sample, a high negative sample, a low positive sample, and a moderate positive sample, along with the kit controls, was tested in-house. Each of the panel members was tested in duplicate, twice per day, for 12 days. The sample panel was masked and randomized. The results are summarized in the following table:

# Interfering Substances

The effect of potential interfering substances on samples using the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgM ELISA Test was evaluated. Three samples, a high negative, an equivocal and a low positive were spiked with high levels of interferants and were tested along with serum without spiked interferants. The recommended concentrations from the guideline “Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry” EP07-A3 from the Clinical and Laboratory

Standards Institute were used (see table below). The tested substances did not affect the performance of the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgM ELISA Test.
