Warnings and Precautions – Test Interpretation

• VITROS B•R•A•H•M•S PCT is not indicated to be used as a stand-alone diagnostic test and should be used in conjunction with clinical signs and symptoms of infection and other diagnostic evidence. In cases where the laboratory results do not agree with the clinical picture or history, additional tests should be performed. Decisions regarding antibiotic therapy should NOT be based solely on procalcitonin concentrations.   
• PCT results should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical status of the patient and other laboratory results. Changes in PCT levels for the prediction of mortality, and overall mortality, are strongly dependent on many factors, including pre-existing patient risk factors and clinical course. The need to continue Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care at Day 4 and other covariates (e.g., age and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score) are also significant predictors of 28-day cumulative mortality risk.

• The safety and performance of PCT-guided therapy for individuals younger than age 18 years, pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals or those on immunomodulatory agents, was not formally analyzed in the supportive clinical trials. Severity of renal failure or insufficiency, may influence procalcitonin values and should be considered as potentially confounding clinical factors when interpreting PCT values. PCT levels may not be elevated in patients infected by certain atypical pathogens, such as Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

Increased PCT levels may not always be related to systemic infection. Patients with increased PCT levels due to other conditions include, but are not limited to:

• Patients experiencing major trauma and/or recent surgical procedure including extracorporeal circulation or burns;   
• Patients under treatment with OKT3 antibodies, OK-432, interleukins, TNF-alpha and other drugs stimulating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines or resulting in anaphylaxis;   
• Patients diagnosed with active medullary C-cell carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, or bronchial carcinoid;   
Patients with acute or chronic viral hepatitis and/or decompensated severe liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C);   
• Patients with prolonged or severe cardiogenic shock, prolonged severe organ perfusion anomalies or after resuscitation from cardiac arrest;   
Patients receiving peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis treatment;   
• Patients with biliary pancreatitis, chemical pneumonitis or heat stroke;   
Patients with invasive fungal infections (e.g. candidiasis, aspergillosis) or acute attacks of plasmodium falciparum malaria; and   
• Neonates during the first 2 days of life.

# Quality Control

Controls containing suitable levels of procalcitonin are recommended for use with the VITROS Immunodiagnostic System. The performance of commercial control fluids should be evaluated for compatibility with this test before they are used for quality control. Control materials may show a difference when compared with other procalcitonin methods if they contain high concentrations of preservatives, stabilizers, or other non-physiological additives, or otherwise depart from a true human sample matrix. Appropriate quality control value ranges must be established for all quality control materials used with the VITROS B•R•A•H•M•S PCT test.

For analytical and clinical studies performed, each day of testing required that VITROS B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT controls (levels 0.5, 2.0, 60) met specifications on all reagent lots.

# L. Test Principles:

A two-step immunometric technique is used, which involves the reaction of procalcitonin present in the sample with a biotinylated anti-procalcitonin antibody (rat monoclonal antiprocalcitonin) bound to streptavidin coated on a microwell in the first step. Unbound

materials are removed by washing. The second step involves the reaction of antigen-antibody complex with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled antibody conjugate (mouse monoclonal anti-procalcitonin). Unbound materials are removed by washing. The bound HRP conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. A reagent containing luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt) and an electron transfer agent, is added to the wells. The HRP in the bound conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative, producing light. The electron transfer agent (a substituted acetanilide) increases the level of light produced and prolongs its emission. The light signals are read by the system. The amount of HRP conjugate bound is directly proportional to the concentration of procalcitonin present.

# Risk assessment for progression to severe sepsis and septic shock

PCT ${ \it \Omega } { > } 2 . 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$

A PCT level above $2 . 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ on the first day of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission is associated with a high risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.

PCT $< 0 . 5 0 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$

A PCT level below $0 . 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ on the first day of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission is associated with a low risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.

Note: PCT levels below $0 . 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ do not exclude an infection, because localized infections (without systemic signs) may also be associated with such low levels. If the PCT measurement is done very early after the systemic infection process has started (usually $< 6$ hours), these values may still be low.

Various non-infectious conditions are known to induce changes in PCT level. PCT levels between $0 . 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $2 . 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ should be interpreted in the context of the specific clinical background and condition(s) of the individual patient. It is recommended to retest PCT within 6-24 hrs if any concentrations $< 2 . 0 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ are obtained.

# 28-Day Mortality

$\Delta \mathrm { P C T } \leq 8 0 \%$

A decrease of PCT levels below or equal to $80 \%$ defines a positive ΔPCT test result representing a higher risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock. If the PCT level increases over the first 4 days, the change in PCT result (ΔPCT) is interpreted as ΔPCT decline ${ \leq } 8 0 \%$ and is defined a positive $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ test result representing a higher risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock.

# $\Delta \mathrm { P C T } > 8 0 \%$

A decrease of PCT levels of more than $80 \%$ defines a negative $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ result representing a lower risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock.

Use the Change in Procalcitonin Calculator (http://www.B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S-PCTCalculator.com) to determine $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ results from the absolute PCT concentrations of a patient obtained on the day severe sepsis or septic shock was first diagnosed (or 24 hours later) and four days thereafter.

The PCT level on Day 1 (the day after severe sepsis or septic shock is first clinically diagnosed) can be used to calculate the percent change in PCT level at Day 4 if the Day 0 measurement is unavailable.

# Discontinuation:

Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued if the PCT is $\leq 0 . 2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ or if the $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ is $5 8 0 \%$ .

# Decision making on antibiotic discontinuation for suspected or confirmed septic patients

Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued if the PCT is $\leq 0 . 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ or if the ΔPCT is $5 8 0 \%$ .

Antibiotic therapy may be continued based upon other clinical findings, such as failure to control a local infection, or ongoing physiologic instability.

If clinical picture has not improved, and PCT remains high, re-evaluate and consider treatment failure or other causes.

# g. High dose Hook:

A human serum-based matrix, containing no measurable procalcitonin (PCT), was spiked with recombinant PCT measured gravimetrically to a concentration of 5,000 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ and then diluted to create a panel of six fluids (seven samples total) having concentrations ranging from 25 to $5 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . These high dose hook fluids were assayed in triplicate using one Master Lot. No evidence of high dose hook was observed up to $5 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

These results support the claim that the VITROS B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT test will not hook back into the measuring range with samples that have a concentration up to $5 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $( 5 , 0 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / L } )$ .

# h. Sample Auto Dilution Study:

Two studies were performed to assess high sample dilution. The first study was designed to verify the recovery of automated (on-board) dilution to manual dilution.

The second study was designed to assess the recovery of automated (on-board) diluted samples compared to the neat sample result.

In the first study, six (6) patient samples with procalcitonin (PCT) concentrations above the expected upper end of the assay measuring range $\left( > 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } \right)$ of the VITROS B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT test were automatically and manually diluted 1:5 and 1:10 with VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products High Sample Diluent B (HSDB). Triplicate determinations of both the automated and manual dilution series were made, using one Master Lot. Dilution recovery was assessed by comparing the automated to manual dilution results.

In the second study, five (5) patient samples with procalcitonin concentrations within the assay measuring range were automatically diluted 1:5 and 1:10 with VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products High Sample Diluent B (HSDB). Samples within the assay measuring range were used for this study to obtain an accurate value of the neat values. Triplicate determinations of both the automated dilution series were made, using one Master Lot. Dilution recovery was assessed by comparing the automated dilution result to the neat result.

The study results demonstrate that samples with procalcitonin concentrations above the expected upper measuring range can be automatically (on-board) diluted with VITROS High Sample Diluent B to either 5-fold, or 10-fold with acceptable recovery.

# i. Carry Over Study:

Ten (10) replicates of a sample above the expected upper end of the assay measuring range were run interleaved with ten (10) replicates of a known blank sample. These twenty total interleaved determinations were made, using one Master Lot. The study results demonstrate that the VITROS B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT test is not susceptible to high procalcitonin concentration samples affecting the predicted concentrations of low procalcitonin samples through the process of sample carryover.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: The quantitative comparison for the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT test (VITROS B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT) was established in accordance with CLSI EP09c Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples, using the B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR assay as the comparative method. Data presented were generated using one Master Lot of the VITROS B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT test on a VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System (3600). The relationship between the methods was determined by Weighted Deming and Passing & Bablok regression analyses and Pearson correlation. The table shows the results of a method comparison study using patient samples analyzed on the

VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System compared with those analyzed using the B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR test.

b. Matrix comparison:

A total of 83 samples covering the measuring range of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT (VITROS B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT) test were used to assess differences in sample matrix between serum, lithium heparin, and EDTA.

Eleven (11) of the eighty-three (83) samples were unaltered prior to testing. The remaining seventy-two (72) samples were spiked with recombinant procalcitonin (PCT) to ensure that sample concentrations covering the full measuring range of the assay were tested.

The results used for this analysis met the acceptance criteria that the comparison between serum, lithium heparin, and EDTA samples spanning the reportable range shall demonstrate less than $10 \%$ bias from serum based on regression analysis (slope of 0.90 - 1.10). Based on the analysis, the results indicate that serum and plasma (lithium heparin and EDTA) matrices are suitable for use with the VITROS B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT test.

3. Clinical studies:

The clinical performance study was conducted to establish the clinical performance characteristics of the VITROS® Immunodiagnostic Products B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT Reagent Pack and VITROS® Immunodiagnostic Products B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT Calibrators (VITROS B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT test) using serial sample sets obtained from the Multicenter Procalcitonin MOnitoring SEpsis (MOSES) Study collection, a well-characterized sample collection in 13 sites across the United States. The study enrolled patients with severe sepsis and septic shock who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from the emergency department, other wards or directly from out of the hospital. Blood samples were collected (when possible) for each subject on Day 0 (within 12 hours after diagnosis), Day 1, Day 3 and Day 4. To verify vital status, subjects were followed during the hospital stay and contacted by telephone at Day 28. See DEN150009 for more details. Available EDTA samples collected from each consented subject were evaluated in this clinical performance study.

EDTA samples were tested with the VITROS B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT test on the VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System at one internal testing site. The technologists performing the VITROS B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT test were unaware of the subjects’ clinical outcomes. If the VITROS B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT test gave a result above the test measuring range, the sample was diluted as volume allowed and was repeated.

The MOSES Study samples were previously tested with the B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR assay, the predicate method, and the existing data was used in the concordance study. No additional testing with the B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR assay was performed in this study due to sample volume limitations.

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Clinical Concordance between VITROS B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT and B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR

Clinical concordance of the VITROS B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT test to the B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR test was evaluated at relevant clinical decision points, i.e., $0 . 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $0 . 2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $0 . 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $2 . 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# b. Association of Δ with 28-day All-Cause Mortality

The VITROS B∙R∙A∙H∙M∙S PCT test was evaluated for the prediction of cumulative 28-day all-cause mortality using retrospective samples from a study of 858 adult patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock recruited across 13 investigational sites in the United States. The analysis population (598 subjects) included $44 \%$ female and $56 \%$ male patients with a mean age of 64 years. About half of the patients had severe sepsis $( 5 1 \% )$ versus septic shock $( 4 9 \% )$ . Infections were mainly community acquired $( 9 1 \% )$ .

The binary test result (ΔPCT decline $> 8 0 \%$ or $\leq 8 0 \%$ ) was significantly associated with 28-day cumulative mortality (vital status on day 28). The two-sided Fisher’s exact test p-value was 0.006. Adjusted for ICU versus non-ICU patient subgroups (based on hospital location at Day 4 after initial diagnosis), the association remained significant (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test $\mathsf { p }$ -value $= 0 . 0 2 6$ ). In each binary $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ subgroup, the 28-day cumulative mortality rate was stratified by need to continue ICU care on Day 4 and the selection of Day 0 versus Day 1 as the baseline measurement day for the ΔPCT calculation:

Additional stratification of patients based on absolute initial PCT levels $( > 2 . 0 0$ $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ or $\leq 2 . 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ ) at Day 0 (or Day 1) revealed subgroups with particularly reduced or elevated mortality risk considering their patient location on Day 4.

\* Prognostic accuracy refers to how accurate the ΔPCT decline $( \leq 8 0 \% \ \mathrm { v s . } > 8 0 \% )$ can predict mortality risk. \*\* Normality approximation of within-imputation variance not valid, therefore the estimate corresponds to withinimputation variation based on exact confidence intervals

The relative mortality ratios for ΔPCT positive (decline $\leq 8 0 \%$ ) versus ΔPCT negative (decline $> 8 0 \%$ ) patient subgroups were:

1.48 for patients with $\mathrm { P C T } > 2 . 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ at Day 0 receiving ICU care on Day 4   
4.31 for patients with $\mathrm { P C T } \leq 2 . 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ at Day 0 receiving ICU care on Day 4   
2.74 for patients with $\mathrm { P C T } > 2 . 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ at Day 0 without ICU care on Day 4   
1.66 for patients with $\mathrm { P C T } \leq 2 . 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ at Day 0 without ICU care on Day 4

Based on relative mortality ratios, a decrease in PCT concentration by $\leq 8 0 \%$ from Day 0 (or Day 1) to Day 4 constitutes a higher risk for mortality within 28 days compared to $> 8 0 \%$ decreases in each subgroup.

Time-to-event analyses, illustrated by the Kaplan-Meier curves below, demonstrate that patients had a lower survival probability (higher cumulative mortality risk) from study Day 4 until the end of follow-up time (Day 28) when the $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ test result was positive compared to when the ΔPCT result was negative in all patient subgroups according to patient location on Day 4 and initial PCT value.

For the prediction of absolute mortality risks, patient location on Day 4 and initial PCT value should be considered:

An initial PCT value $\leq 2 . 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ on Day 0 followed by a PCT decline of more than $80 \%$ by Day 4 indicates a 4-fold lower cumulative 28-day mortality risk $( 5 . 5 \% )$ for patients with severe sepsis or septic shock who are still in the ICU by Day 4 compared to those patients with an initial PCT value $> 2 . 0 0$ $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ $( 2 2 . 7 \% )$ . Regardless of the initial PCT value, patients in the ICU on Day 4 that do not have more than an $80 \%$ decline in PCT plasma value from Day 0 to Day 4 have an even higher mortality risk of $2 3 . 7 \% - 3 3 . 7 \%$ .

An initial PCT value $> 2 . 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ that does not decline by more than $80 \%$ by Day 4 signals that such patients remain at high mortality risk $( 1 5 . 1 \% )$ even when they are no longer receiving ICU care on Day 4. Mortality was otherwise observed between $5 . 0 \%$ to $8 . 3 \%$ for patients discharged from the ICU by Day 4.

A ∆PCT from Day 0 to Day 4 (decline $\leq 8 0 \%$ versus decline $> 8 0 \%$ ) as a prognostic for 28-day cumulative risk of mortality was quantified by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis with a hazard ratio of 1.93 $9 5 \%$ CI of 1.19-3.12; p-value $= 0 . 0 0 8 $ ). The relative risk of cumulative 28-day mortality is about 2-fold higher if an individual tests positive for $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ (decline $\leq 8 0 \%$ ) than if an individual tests negative (decline $> 8 0 \%$ ).

As a comparison, the table below lists the univariate hazard ratios for other clinical factors evaluated as separate predictors of mortality in the study population.

A ΔPCT from Day 0 (or Day 1) to Day 4 remains a prognostic parameter for the risk of cumulative 28-day mortality in patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock even when the hazard ratio is adjusted for other mortality predictors in Cox multiple regression models. The relative mortality risk estimates for $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ and selected predictors are presented below with $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals. For continuous predictors, the hazard ratio (HR) was calculated for one standard deviation (SD) change in the predictor. For binary predictors, the risk estimate compares the hazards for the two binary results.

\*The models also included the following predictors (hazard ratio results not shown): antibiotic adequacy, sepsis severity, biological infection type, clinical infection type, positive blood culture, PCT value on Day 0, gender. In the analysis, missing values for predictors were multiple imputed assuming they were Missing at Random (MAR), with the multiple imputations combined according to Rubin’s rules.

The change of PCT over time can also be described by the ratio of PCT values from Day 4 and Day 0 (or Day 1):

A decline of $\Delta \mathrm { P C T } = 8 0 \%$ translates into a PCT ratio of 0.2. The PCT ratio has values larger than 0.2 when the ΔPCT decline is less than $80 \%$ , which is associated with a higher risk for cumulative 28-day all-cause mortality in patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock. Likewise, a PCT ratio below 0.2 indicates a lower risk for mortality within 28 days. On a continuous scale, the relative mortality risk for such patients is higher the larger the PCT ratio. The following table lists the hazard ratios for an increase by the factor 2 in PCT ratio (i.e., the relative increase in mortality risk for a patient with any given PCT ratio compared to a patient with a 2-fold lower PCT ratio). For the patient location at Day 4, the risk estimate compares the hazards for patients with versus without ICU care on Day 4.

$^ { \ast \ast }$ A unit change of $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ on log-2-scale corresponded to 0.56 SD of ∆PCT from Day 0 until Day 4 (0.78 SD for ΔPCT from Day 1 until Day 4). Accordingly, the reported ∆PCT hazard ratios refer to an increase of $\Delta \mathrm { P C T }$ by a factor of 2. For comparability, hazard ratios of the other continuous predictors were estimated for the same fractional SD (i.e., 0.56 or 0.78, respectively).

c. Clinical Specificity: See clinical sensitivity above.
