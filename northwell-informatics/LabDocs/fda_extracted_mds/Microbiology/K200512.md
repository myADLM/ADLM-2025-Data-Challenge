Re: K200512 Trade/Device Name: ETEST Plazomicin (PLZ) $( 0 . 0 1 6 { - } 2 5 6 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ Regulation Number: 21 CFR 866.1640 Regulation Name: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Powder Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: JWY Dated: February 28, 2020 Received: March 2, 2020

Dear Alexia Bosquet:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR

803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

# D. Device Description:

$\mathrm { E T E S T ^ { \textregistered } }$ is a thin, inert and non-porous plastic strip carrying the MIC reading scale in $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ on one side and a predefined antibiotic gradient on the other side.

When the strip is applied to an inoculated agar surface, the preformed antibiotic gradient immediately transfers into the agar matrix, then forming a stable, continuous and exponential gradient of antibiotic concentrations directly underneath the strip. Bacterial growth becomes visible during incubation, and a symmetrical inhibition ellipse centered along the strip appears. The MIC value is read from the scale in terms of $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ at complete inhibition of bacterial growth, where the pointed end of the ellipse intersects the strip.

ETEST® Plazomicin contains a range of plazomicin from 0.016 to $2 5 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$

# E. Intended Use:

# G. Performance Overview

ETEST® Plazomicin (PLZ) (0.016-256 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ demonstrated substantially equivalent performance when compared with the CLSI M07-A11 January 2018 broth microdilution reference method, following rules as defined in the FDA Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA, issued on August 28, 2009 and following specifications as defined in CLSI M100 $\dot { 2 } 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ Ed. (January 2019) and $3 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ Ed. (January 2020).

This Premarket Notification $( 5 1 0 [ \mathrm { k } ] )$ presents data in support of ETEST® Plazomicin (PLZ $( 0 . 0 1 6 { - } 2 5 6 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ ) for Enterobacteriaceae.

External evaluations were conducted with fresh and stock clinical isolates, as well as a set of challenge strains. The external evaluations were designed to establish the performance of ETEST® Plazomicin (PLZ) $( 0 . 0 1 6 - 2 5 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ by comparing with the CLSI broth microdilution reference method.

ETEST® Plazomicin (PLZ) $( 0 . 0 1 6 { - } 2 5 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ ) demonstrated acceptable performance as presented in Table 1 below:

Table 1: Performance Characteristics for ETEST® Plazomicin

# Notes:

a) $\mathrm { E A } = \%$ of MIC values within $\pm 1$ dilution of the reference method.   
b) The performance data presented for Enterobacteriaceae include Escherichia coli (78), Klebsiella pneumoniae (89), Proteus mirabilis (63), Enterobacter cloacae (60), Citrobacter freundii (59), Citrobacter koseri (34), Klebsiella (Enterobacter) aerogenes (38), Klebsiella oxytoca (39), Morganella morganii (31), Proteus vulgaris (34), Providencia stuartii (35) and Serratia marcescens (38).   
c) The optional inoculator and ETEST $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ strip applicator can be used for plate inoculation and applying ETEST $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ strips onto agar media. In the ETEST $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Plazomicin clinical studies, swabs and the Inoculator RETRO $\mathrm { C 8 0 ^ { r m } }$ were used for plate inoculation/streaking and forceps and the Vacuum Pen NEMA $\mathrm { C 8 8 ^ { r m } }$ were used for ETEST $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ strip application.   
d) The Category Agreement was $< 9 0 \%$ for the following organisms: Morganella morganii $( 6 7 . 7 \% )$ , Proteus mirabilis $( 8 5 . 7 \% )$ , Providencia stuartii $( 7 4 . 3 \% )$ , Proteus vulgaris $( 8 5 . 3 \% )$ and Serratia marcescens $( 8 9 . 5 \% )$ . The performance is acceptable since the Essential Agreement was $> 9 0 \%$ and all categorical errors were minor and within essential agreement, except for one isolate of Serratia marcescens.   
e) ETEST $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Plazomicin MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or one doubling dilution lower when testing Morganella morganii compared to the reference broth microdilution method.   
f) ETEST $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Plazomicin MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or at least one doubling dilution higher when testing Klebsiella (Enterobacter) aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae compared to the CLSI reference broth microdilution method. However, this trending did not impact the Essential or Category Agreement (Klebsiella aerogenes EA: $100 \%$ , CA: $100 \%$ ; Klebsiella pneumoniae EA: $100 \%$ ; $\mathrm { C A } { : } 9 8 . 9 \%$ ).

# Limitations:

The ability of ETEST Plazomicin to detect the following resistant isolates is unknown because a sufficient number of resistant isolates were not available at the time of comparative testing: Citrobacter koseri, Serratia marcescens.

Reproducibility and Quality Control demonstrated acceptable results.

# Conclusion:

The performance data presented in this submission support a substantial equivalence decision. ETEST® Plazomicin (PLZ) $( 0 . 0 1 6 { - } 2 5 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ ) is substantially equivalent to ETEST® Telavancin (TLA) $( 0 . 0 0 2 { - } 3 2 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ ) (K180936).
