# 5.3 Predicate Device

The predicate device is APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module, K183648.   
This predicate has not been subject to a design related recall.

# 5.4 Device Description

APAS Independence is a device designed to be used in a microbiology laboratory to automate the initial screening of specimens for the presence of growth on culture plates. It is an in vitro diagnostic device and has no direct contact with patients.

The APAS Independence consists of an automated plate handling mechanism to move culture plates through the instrument, an imaging station to capture images of culture plates, and software for image analysis (e.g., determination of growth) and presentation of reports.

The APAS Independence is intended to be installed with multiple software (analysis) modules, each of which will provide an assessment of growth for a specific clinical indication. More than one analysis module may be developed for the same indication to allow APAS to assess growth on culture plates from multiple agar manufacturers sold for the same indications.

This submission includes two MRSA analysis modules that have been developed for the same indication, which is to be used in a microbiology laboratory to automate the initial screening for the presence of presumptive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) growth on culture plates. It is indicated for the screening of MRSA colonization from swabs, where a specimen is collected from the anterior nares by non-invasive sampling techniques and plated onto specified chromogenic MRSA agars. No quantification of growth is required.

APAS Independence with IC MRSA Chromogenic BD Analysis Module is designed to interpret growth on BBL™ CHROMagar™ MRSA II agar from Becton Dickinson, and APAS Independence with IC MRSA Chromogenic TFS/S Analysis Module is designed to interpret growth on Spectra™ MRSA agar from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Remel).

Table 5-1. shows reported final plate designation and relationship to plate interpretation result for each module, respectively.

Table 5-1: APAS final designation

Both modules provide a triaging step within the workflow of a microbiology laboratory. Each module takes two key inputs (agar plate images and flags) and computes a final plate designation so that the plate can be efficiently and appropriately routed to the next step in the laboratory workflow.

# For APAS Independence with IC MRSA Chromogenic BD Analysis Module, the final designation will be either Presumptive MRSA or Negative.

Presumptive MRSA designation indicates that the culture plate was determined to contain colored colonies which are suspected to be MRSA. Investigation and confirmation by a microbiologist are required.

• Negative designation indicates that the culture plate was determined to not contain colored colonies indicative of MRSA. No further investigations will be required.

Figure 5-1 provides an illustration of the expected workflow after the IC MRSA Chromogenic BD Analysis Module has produced a screening result.

![](images/f97b423c4fb0126977ec6edab862279b4f6de5632b2c2b24db11bdfb44fcfecc.jpg)

When APAS Independence with IC MRSA Chromogenic BD analysis module completes the analysis of each plate, the APAS-generated result is sent to the LIS. In the case of a Negative designation which does not require any further work, the final laboratory report can be issued according to standard reporting protocols without any investigation. Any Presumptive MRSA designations, however, will require investigation according to laboratory protocols for confirmation.

For APAS Independence with IC MRSA Chromogenic TFS/S Analysis Module the final designation will be either Presumptive MRSA, Presumptive non-MRSA, or Negative.

Presumptive MRSA designation indicates that the culture is likely to contain colored colonies which are suspected to be MRSA. Investigation and confirmation by a microbiologist are required.

Presumptive non-MRSA designation indicates that the culture is likely to contain growth of organisms not typically suspected to be MRSA. Review is required by a microbiologist.

Negative designation indicates that no growth is present on the plate. No further investigations will be required.

Figure 5-2 provides an illustration of the expected workflow after the IC MRSA Chromogenic TFS/S Analysis Module has produced a screening result.

Figure 5-2: Typical workflow of APAS Independence with IC MRSA Chromogenic TFS/S analysis module

When APAS Independence with IC MRSA Chromogenic TFS/S analysis module completes the analysis of each plate, the APAS-generated result is sent to the LIS. In the case of a Negative designation, which does not require any further work, the final laboratory report can be issued according to standard reporting protocols without any investigation. Any Presumptive MRSA or Presumptive nonMRSA designation, however, will require investigation according to laboratory protocols for confirmation prior to a laboratory report being issued.

# 5.6.1 APAS Independence with IC MRSA Chromogenic BD Analysis Module

The APAS Independence is an in vitro diagnostic system comprised of an instrument for automated imaging of agar plates and a software analysis module for the following use:

The APAS Independence, when using its IC MRSA Chromogenic BD analysis module, automates culture plate imaging and interpretation to detect the presence or absence of colonies with colors suggestive of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) growth on Beckton Dickson BBL™ CHROMagar™ MRSA II agar that has been inoculated with anterior nares swabs and incubated at $3 6 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C \pm 1 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for 24 hours.

The APAS Independence, when using its IC MRSA Chromogenic BD analysis module, provides an aid in routine screening for colonization with MRSA. It provides one of two screening results: Presumptive MRSA or Negative. All culture plates that are identified as Presumptive MRSA by the APAS Independence, when using the IC MRSA Chromogenic BD analysis module require review by a trained microbiologist.

# 5.6.2 APAS Independence with IC MRSA Chromogenic TFS/S Analysis Module

The APAS Independence is an in vitro diagnostic system comprised of an instrument for automated imaging of agar plates and a software analysis module for the following use:

The APAS Independence, when using its IC MRSA Chromogenic TFS/S analysis module, automates culture plate imaging and interpretation to detect the presence or absence of colonies with colors suggestive of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) growth on Thermo-Fisher Spectra™ MRSA agar that has been inoculated with anterior nares swabs and incubated at $3 6 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \pm 1 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for 24 hours.

The APAS Independence, when using its IC MRSA Chromogenic TFS/S analysis module, provides an aid in routine screening for colonization with MRSA. It provides one of three screening results: Presumptive MRSA, Presumptive non-MRSA, or Negative. All culture plates that are identified as Presumptive MRSA or Presumptive non-MRSA by the APAS Independence, when using the IC MRSA Chromogenic TFS/S analysis module, require review by a trained microbiologist.

# 5.6.3 Predicate device APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module

The indication for use of the predicate device, which is the APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module, is as follows:

The APAS Independence is an in vitro diagnostic system comprised of an instrument for automated imaging of agar culture plates and a software analysis module for the following use:

The APAS Independence, when using its urine analysis module, automates urine culture plate imaging and interpretation to detect the presence or absence of microbial growth on sheep blood and MacConkey agar culture plates that are inoculated with a 1μL sample volume. The

APAS Independence, when using its urine analysis module, provides a semi-quantitative assessment of colony counts that are used as an aid in the diagnosis of urinary tract infection. All urine culture plates that are identified as positive for growth by the APAS Independence, when using its urine analysis module, must be reviewed by a trained microbiologist.

The difference in indications for use reflects the different therapeutic screening purposes supported by APAS. Neither the predicate urine analysis module nor either of the MRSA analysis modules provide a final diagnostic result; for each module, a positive screening result is confirmed by a microbiologist.

The same questions of safety and effectiveness for all analysis modules are addressed by fulfilling the requirements of the Special Controls for automated image assessment systems for microbial colonies on solid culture media.

# 5.7 Comparison of Technological Characteristics with the Predicate Device

The nominated predicate device is the APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module which was cleared via application K183648.

APAS Independence when using both MRSA analysis modules included in this submission uses the same technology and methods to provide an interpretation of growth from anterior nares swabs taken by non-invasive techniques and cultured for screening for specific indications.

Both devices have been developed by Clever Culture Systems (CCS). Table 5-2 provides a side-byside comparison of the main components of APAS Independence as used in the predicate and the two new devices, showing that no changes were necessary to accommodate the two new modules.

# 5.8 Performance Data

This section addresses the software verification and validation conducted for each MRSA analysis module, and the performance requirements specified as Special Controls for a device of this type, which require that pre-market notification submissions include:

1) detailed documentation of the analytical studies performed to characterize device performance to support the intended use, as appropriate.   
2) detailed documentation from clinical studies performed on a population that is consistent with the intended use population. a) The clinical studies must establish the device performance based on comparison to results obtained by an acceptable reference method, as appropriate. b) The clinical study documentation must include the study protocol with a predefined statistical analysis plan and the final report documenting support for the Indications for Use and the results of the statistical analysis, as appropriate.

# 5.8.1 Analysis Module Software Verification and Validation

Software verification and validation testing were conducted, and documentation was provided as recommended by FDA’s Guidance for Industry and Staff, Guidance for the ContentofPremarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices. The software for this device was considered as a “moderate” level of concern as a malfunction of, or latent design flaw in the software could lead to an erroneous diagnosis or a delay in delivery of appropriate medical care that would likely lead to a Minor injury to the patient. See Section 16 for additional details.

# 5.8.2 Digital Image Quality, Digital Image Interpretation

When conducting clinical studies and some analytical performance studies, the reference result against which APAS performance was compared was generated by microbiologists interpreting growth on digital images of plates (plate image) rather than from the physical plate (plate-in-hand). Studies were conducted to determine:

a) If the interpretation of the digital image of the same plate is reproducible across microbiologists, as this is the method used to generate performance data in support of the current 510(k) application.   
b) Whether the plate-in-hand interpretation and plate image interpretation of the same plate are equivalent across microbiologists to determine if a microbiologist can equivalently interpret presumptive MRSA on the plate and the digital image, as this provide confidence that the digital image interpretation is a true representation of the agar plate interpretation.

# 5.8.2.1 Point (a) Reproducibility of plate image interpretations

The reproducibility of plate image interpretations was assessed by comparing the individual assessments of plate images by three microbiologists with a single panel result (i.e., majority vote) for each image. Table 5-5 shows the percent agreement of the three microbiologists with the panel result for detection of presumptive MRSA, presumptive non-MRSA, and no growth on each of the BD BBL and TFS Spectra media.

Table 5-5: Microbiologist agreement with panel result

Table 5-5 shows that for BD media, when interpreting growth from digital images, microbiologists agree with the panel $100 \%$ of the time for detection of presumptive MRSA, over $9 7 \%$ of the time for presumptive non-MRSA, and over $9 5 \%$ of the time for no growth. Combining (averaging) these results yields $1 0 0 \%$ , $9 8 . 4 \%$ and $9 8 . 1 \% ,$ , respectively. These results support the use of digital images by a panel of microbiologists to establish a reference result against which the APAS result can be compared.

Table 5-5 shows that for TFS/S media, when interpreting growth from digital images, microbiologists agree with the panel more than $9 7 \%$ of the time for detection of presumptive MRSA, $93 \%$ of the time for presumptive non-MRSA, and $98 \%$ of the time for no growth. Combining (averaging) these results yields $9 7 . 7 \%$ , $9 5 . 1 \%$ and $9 9 . 0 \%$ , respectively. These results support the use of digital images by a panel of microbiologists to establish a reference result against which the APAS result can be compared.

# 5.8.2.2 Point (b) Equivalency of Plate-in-Hand vs. Plate Image

The equivalency of plate-in-hand vs. plate image measurements were assessed by measuring the percent of time a microbiologist’s interpretations of the plate and image were in agreement for presumptive MRSA and applying an acceptance criterion of $95 \%$ for the combined result. In this comparison, the plate-in-hand interpretation is considered to be the truth state.

# 5.8.3 Quality Control Test Results

During the IVD and analytical performance studies, quality control tests were conducted using the methods described in the APAS Independence User Manual. Daily instrument checks were conducted for Colour Check and System Check using the tools provided with the instrument and both tests passed on all testing days.

In addition, biological quality control testing was performed using specially prepared positive QC plates as described in the user manuals for each of the analysis modules. These QC plates were prepared from a 0.5 McFarland suspension in saline of $S .$ aureus MRSA ATCC 43300 which was serially diluted with sterile saline to make a suspension containing approximately $1 0 ^ { 5 }$ cells per mL and then inoculated onto BBL™ CHROMagar™ MRSA II plates and Spectra™ MRSA plates using a 10 µL loop for quadrant streaking. The plates were incubated at $3 6 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \pm 1 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for 24 hours.

A positive QC was performed for each instrument used per experiment for each day of the IVD study and analytical studies. APAS produced the expected presumptive positive MRSA result in all cases.

# 5.8.4 Analytical Performance Studies

# 5.8.4.1 Accuracy - Trueness

This study tested the ability of APAS to correctly detect colonies of MRSA and non-MRSA.

A range of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and other non-MRSA organisms that may grow on the media, were used to produce 0.5 McFarland suspensions of pure cultures. These were serially diluted in sterile saline to create suspensions which, when streaked, produced either light or confluent growth. The plates were incubated at $3 6 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \pm 1 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for 24 hours then imaged using APAS. Across the set of images produced for each of the organisms plated, at least 100 isolated colonies were digitally labelled by a microbiologist as displaying the distinctive morphology associated with colonies of MRSA or non-MRSA on the specific agar, where non-MRSA means colonies which will grow on the media but do not react with the chromogen. The APAS result for each colony was compared with the result by the microbiologist.

Table 5-7 shows that APAS with IC MRSA Chromogenic BD analysis module was able to correctly detect the typical morphology associated with MRSA $9 9 . 3 ~ \%$ of the time.

The measured performance of both modules met the performance target of $9 5 \%$ .

# 5.8.4.2 Accuracy - Precision

The reproducibility of plate interpretation performed by the APAS when installed with each module was evaluated on different instruments over multiple runs. The test determined:

Repeatability of interpretation within an instrument when the same plate is presented to the imaging system at the same angle and at different angles, and   
Reproducibility of interpretations across instruments.

Testing was performed using 3 dilutions of two strains of MRSA, (one isolated from the wild and one ATCC strain), and 3 dilutions of two strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, both of which were isolated from the wild and which will grow on BD and Spectra media but do not react with the chromogen. The dilutions were chosen to produce plates with mainly confluent growth (dilution 1), partially confluent growth (dilution 2) and only isolated colonies (dilution 3), respectively, when 10µL of each dilution is plated using the quadrant streak method. Each dilution was inoculated in triplicate and the plates incubated at $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for 24 hours. Five replicate images of each plate were taken at 3 different orientations $\langle 0 ^ { \circ } , 1 2 0 ^ { \circ }$ and $2 7 0 ^ { \circ }$ ) on 3 different APAS Independence instruments.

The results tables report the agreement of the APAS-generated interpretation with the expected outcome (presence or absence of presumptive MRSA (Color) and Growth), along with the agreement across instruments, expressed as a percent. Confidence intervals are calculated for the measure of reproducibility across instruments.

Table 5-9 provides the results for IC MRSA Chromogenic BD Analysis Module and Table 5-10 provides the results for IC MRSA Chromogenic TFS/S Analysis Module. The results demonstrate reproducibility of APAS-generated results with multiple plate orientations and across multiple instruments.

# 5.8.4.3 Analytical Sensitivity – Limit of Detection of Colony Size

A study was conducted to determine the smallest colony size that can be reproducibly detected as presumptive MRSA $9 5 \%$ of the time. The study was conducted using 2 strains of MRSA, one ATCC strain and one wild strain.

Five 10-fold dilutions of a 0.5 McFarland suspension were prepared of each organism and the fifth dilution (approximately $1 0 ^ { 3 } \mathrm { C F U / m L } )$ was further diluted 1:2. 100µL of the final dilution was spread onto 6 replicate plates and incubated at $3 6 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \pm 1 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ until pinpoint colonies were detected. The plates were then imaged and returned to the incubator at 1-hour intervals until the colonies on the plate were approximately 2mm in diameter.

Selecting from the images at each timepoint, the operator digitally labelled multiple isolated colonies to measure the colony diameter. The image of each plate was then analysed to generate the corresponding APAS result. The smallest colony diameter that was successfully detected for growth and color by APAS ${ > } 9 5 \%$ of the time was identified as the smallest colony size for each organism (bolded result).

Results of the study demonstrated that the smallest MRSA colony size that can be detected $95 \%$ of the time by APAS is $0 . 8 2 \mathsf { m m }$ for MRSA wild strain and $0 . 9 1 \ \mathsf { m m }$ for MRSA ATCC 43300 using the BD module (Table 5-11) and $0 . 6 3 \mathrm { \ : m m }$ for MRSA wild strain and $0 . 5 4 \ : \mathrm { m m }$ for MRSA ATCC 43300 using the TFS/S module (Table 5-12).

# 5.8.4.4 Analytical Sensitivity – Detection of MRSA in Mixtures

This test evaluated the ability of APAS to detect small amounts (1-100 colonies) and large amounts $_ { \cdot > 1 0 0 }$ colonies) of MRSA when in the presence of other growth $_ { \cdot > 1 0 0 }$ white colonies) after incubation for 24 hours.

Five, 10-fold dilutions of a 0.5 McFarland suspension were prepared with two strains of MRSA, one strain of S haemolyticus and one strain of S warneri, all of which had been isolated from the wild. A 1:1 mixture and a 1:10 mixture of MRSA with a non-MRSA organism were prepared for two different combinations of MRSA and non-MRSA. The plates were incubated at $3 6 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \pm 1 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for 24 hours. The images were read and interpreted by APAS and by 3 microbiologists, each of whom recorded the presence or absence of MRSA colonies on the plate. The majority vote was taken as the truth state against which the APAS result was compared.

The results for APAS Independence with IC Chromogenic MRSA BD Analysis Module are shown in Table 5-13 and show that APAS correctly identifies the presence of MRSA colonies $29 5 \%$ of the time at 24 hours.

# 5.8.4.5 Analytical Specificity – Limit of Blank

This test examined the ability of APAS to correctly identify when there is no growth present on the agar, and therefore determine the likelihood of false positives caused by known interferences.

A test matrix of plates with no growth were prepared using 3 different applicators (flocked swab, cotton swab and 10µL loop) to inoculate plates using 3 different media (Stuart Transport, Amies Transport and saline) and no media (dry). The plates were labelled with one of 4 different labels applied to the base or side and were either marked with felt-tip pen or not. The test therefore consisted of a matrix of 96 plates (3 applicators x 4 media x 4 labels x 2 marks).

Table 5-15 shows that for APAS with IC MRSA Chromogenic BD, there was good agreement that colored colonies indicative of MRSA were not present. The table also shows that growth may be detected, but that it was unlikely to be reported as presumptive MRSA.

# 5.8.4.6 Analytical Specificity – Interference with detection of MRSA

This test evaluated the ability of APAS to correctly detect MRSA in the presence of known interferences and to determine if a heavy growth of non-MRSA is detected by APAS as MRSA, as heavy growth of some non-MRSA organisms may display a chromogen reaction.

Pure 0.5 McFarland suspensions of MRSA and S. haemolyticus (representing non-MRSA) were serially diluted to produce an inoculum for each organism which would produce predominantly isolated colonies of MRSA and heavy growth of S. haemolyticus when cultured.

A test matrix of plates per organism was quadrant streaked using 3 different applicators (flocked swab, cotton swab and 10µL loop) to inoculate plates using 2 different media (Stuart Transport and Amies Transport). The plates were labelled with one of 4 different labels applied to the base or side and were either marked with felt-tip pen or not. The test therefore consisted of 48 plates (3 applicators $\textsf { x 2 }$ media x 4 labels x 2 marks) per organism. The inoculated plates were incubated at $3 6 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \pm 1 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for 24 hours and then imaged.

The images were processed to generate the APAS report for each plate and then the reported presence or absence of MRSA and non-MRSA were compared with the expected result for growth and color, which was the presence of colored growth and no colored growth, respectively.

The results for APAS Independence with IC MRSA Chromogenic BD Analysis Module are shown in Table 5-17. These results show that the interference modes tested had minimal impact on the ability of APAS to detect the presence of MRSA. The results also show that when a heavy inoculum of S. haemolyticus is present, false positive detections as presumptive MRSA occurred in this interference study.

Left-over specimens from standard of care screening culture for colonization with MRSA were collected and inoculated onto chromogenic agar plates at a single site in Australia. The plates were then incubated and imaged with the APAS.

The APAS result for each image was compared against each of two reference results; one panel was located in the USA and the other in Australia. Each reference result was achieved using the majority result from the respective panel of 3 independent microbiologists.

Due to the low positivity rate for MRSA detection in the study population, simulated samples were prepared to supplement the study. The simulated swab samples were spiked with known MRSA and non-MRSA organisms. The use of simulated samples allowed the inclusion of unique strains of MRSA that provided global representation of the most common MRSA clades, including those found in the United States.

Each specimen and simulated sample were inoculated onto a culture plate and incubated for 24 hours at $3 6 \pm 1 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ prior to analysis by APAS Independence and by the reference panels.

Performance was assessed by comparing the final interpretation of digital plate images established by the microbiologists (reference method) with the corresponding interpretation by APAS. The primary performance objective was positive percent agreement of presumptive MRSA growth.

# 5.9 Conclusions

# 5.9.1 2 vs 3 Designation Rule Set

The overall performances for the BD MRSA and TFS/S MRSA analysis modules have been evaluated to determine the possible claims that could be supported and how performance issues could be mitigated. As a result, considering data and supportive metrics from other studies, it was concluded that either a two-designation rule set (i.e., presumptive MRSA growth and negative) or a threedesignation rule set (i.e., presumptive MRSA growth, presumptive non-MRSA growth, and negative) would be appropriate.

The overall performance of the BD MRSA analysis module for detection of presumptive MRSA growth (both in the analytical studies and clinical study) is acceptable to support a two-designation rule set (i.e., presumptive MRSA growth and negative). As such, only plates with “presumptive MRSA growth” require review by a microbiologist. The acceptability of the two-designation rule set is based on the following performance metrics:

${ > } 9 5 \%$ agreement for “presumptive MRSA growth” $( 9 5 . 9 \% ,$ Table 5-6) in the digital image   
quality study   
$59 8 \%$ agreement for “presumptive MRSA growth” in the Australian $( 1 0 0 . 0 \%$ , Table 5-20) and   
US clinical studies $( 9 9 . 7 \%$ , Table 5-21)   
${ > } 9 5 \%$ agreement for “presumptive MRSA growth” when comparing the Australian and US   
microbiologist panel results $( 9 9 . 2 \%$ , Table 5-26)

The overall performance of the TFS/S MRSA analysis modules for detection of presumptive MRSA growth (both in the analytical studies and clinical study) is acceptable to support a three-designation rule set (i.e., presumptive MRSA growth, presumptive non-MRSA growth, and negative). As such, all plates with growth (“presumptive MRSA growth” or “presumptive non-MRSA growth) require review by a microbiologist. The acceptability of the three-designation rule set is based on the following performance metrics:

${ < } 9 5 \%$ agreement for “presumptive MRSA growth” $( 9 3 . 5 \%$ , Table 5-6) in the digital image quality study   
$59 8 \%$ agreement for “presumptive MRSA growth” in the Australian reference panel $( 9 9 . 2 \% ,$ Table 5-23) and US clinical studies $( 9 9 . 5 \% )$ , Table 5-24)   
${ < } 9 5 \%$ agreement for “presumptive MRSA growth” when comparing the Australian and US microbiologist panel results $( 9 0 . 6 \%$ , Table 5-27)

# 5.9.2 Substantial Equivalence

Both APAS Independence with IC MRSA Chromogenic BD Analysis Module and APAS Independence with IC MRSA Chromogenic TFS/S Analysis Module have equivalent safety and effectiveness to the predicate device, APAS Independence with Urine Analysis Module (K183648) because:

They have the same intended use.   
The technological characteristics are very similar.   
The differences in technological characteristics do not raise different questions about safety and effectiveness.   
The same questions of safety and effectiveness are addressed by fulfilling the requirements of the Special Controls for automated image assessment systems for microbial colonies on solid culture media.   
The safety and effectiveness of the MRSA modules compared with the urine module has been assured by applying the same $98 \%$ Positive Percent Agreement target for the decision point where a microbiologist review is required. For urine analysis and IC MRSA Chromogenic

TFS/S, the decision is whether growth is present on the agar. For IC MRSA Chromogenic BD, the decision is whether chromogen activation is detected, indicating a presumptive MRSA result.
