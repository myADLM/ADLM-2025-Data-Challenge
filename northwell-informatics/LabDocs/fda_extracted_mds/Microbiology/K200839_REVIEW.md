The APAS Independence is intended to be installed with multiple, independent software (analysis) modules, each of which will provide an assessment of growth for a specific clinical indication. More than one analysis module may be developed for the same Indication for Use to allow APAS to assess growth on culture plates from multiple agar manufacturers. In this application, two independent MRSA analysis modules have been designed to interpret microbial growth as follows:

APAS Independence with IC Chromogenic MRSA BD Analysis Module is designed to interpret microbial growth on BBL CHROMagar MRSA II agar from Becton Dickinson APAS Independence with IC Chromogenic MRSA TFS/S Analysis Module is designed to interpret microbial growth on Remel Spectra MRSA agar from Thermo Fisher Scientific.

The APAS Independence with the IC Chromogenic MRSA BD and TFS/S Analysis Modules images and evaluates chromogenic agar plates (BBL CHROMagar MRSA II and Remel Spectra MRSA, respectively) to determine and report plate results. Each module has its own reporting scheme (described in Table 2) based on the analytical and clinical performance data and corresponding risk mitigations.

# B Principle of Operation:

APAS Independence when using a MRSA analysis module is designed to detect the presence or absence of presumptive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) growth on chromogenic MRSA agar plates. No quantification of growth is required since it is not used to inform clinical decisions. The system comprises an imaging station to capture images of chromogenic MRSA agar plates and a plate handling system that moves plates between the input carriers, imaging station and output carriers or stacks. The software conducts analysis of the images, assessment of microbial colonies (if present), and result designation.

The APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis Modules is indicated for screening MRSA chromogenic agar plates (BBL CHROMagar MRSA II and Remel Spectra MRSA) inoculated with anterior nares swab specimens and incubated for 24 hours. The system takes digital images of each plate that are analyzed automatically to determine if presumptive MRSA colonies are present. For each plate, the APAS Independence performs the following tasks:

a. digitally combines several images of the plate for analysis,   
b. categorizes each pixel of the image according to the visually different areas on the plate (e.g., type of growth or agar background),   
c. determines how pixels are arranged in relation to each other (e.g., clumps of related pixels may represent a colony),   
d. counts the number of colonies per colony type (although colony counts are not reported in the MRSA Analysis Modules),   
e. differentiates between MRSA and non-MRSA colony types and reports presumptive results accordingly,   
f. incorporates data from the Laboratory Information System (LIS) to provide a final report; when applicable based on clinical context (“flagged”), a “negative” result may be modified to “presumptive MRSA growth” to alert the microbiologist that further investigation may be warranted.

When using the IC MRSA Chromogenic BD Analysis module (BD module), all plates with presumptive MRSA growth are designated for review by a trained microbiologist for determination of status and follow up testing according to conventional laboratory practice. Plates with presumptive non-MRSA growth or no growth are not designated for review and may be discarded according to the standard operating procedures of the laboratory.

When using the IC MRSA Chromogenic TFS/S Analysis module (TFS/S module), all plates with presumptive MRSA growth or presumptive non-MRSA growth are designated for review by a trained microbiologist for determination of status and follow up testing according to conventional laboratory practice. Plates with no growth are not designated for review and may be discarded according to the standard operating procedures of the laboratory.

1. Instrument Name: APAS Independence

2. Specimen Identification:

Plates are identified using an integrated barcode scanner within the Imaging Module of the APAS Independence. The identity of each plate is displayed on the results screen and transmitted automatically to the LIS.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The operator loads carriers containing culture plates into the Input Module of the APAS Independence from which they are moved automatically, one plate at a time, to the Imaging Module where the barcode is read, the lid is removed, and images of the agar surface are captured. Upon completion of image capture and analysis, the plate lid is replaced, and the system automatically sorts each plate based on its designation into the appropriate carrier in the Output Module.

# 4. Calibration:

The APAS Independence requires daily color calibration prior to analysis of culture plates. Calibration is performed using the Color Check Tool provided with the instrument, a multicolored disk for checking and correcting color of the system optics. Instruction for the daily Color Check is included in the APAS Independence User Manual. In the event of a Color Check failure, the check should be repeated. If the repeated failure occurs, the instrument should not be used until it has been serviced.

# 5. Quality Control:

After daily calibration (Color Check), a System Check must be performed followed by biological Quality Control testing.

The System Check Tool comprises a pair of disks with small dots replicating colonies for checking overall system functionality and associated software. Instruction for daily System Check is provided in the User Manual for the APAS Independence.

Daily biological Quality Control testing is performed using a reference culture plate inoculated with a MRSA positive strain (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300). Instructions for testing is provided in the User Manuals for the APAS Independence with IC MRSA Chromogenic BD Analysis Module and APAS Independence with IC MRSA Chromogenic TFS/S Analysis Module.

In the event of a System Check or Quality Control testing failure, the check/testing should be repeated. If the repeated failure occurs, the instrument should not be used until it has been serviced. In the event of a System Check fail, the instrument should be locked to prevent processing of additional culture plates until service has been performed.

# Reproducibility

The reproducibility of presumptive MRSA and non-presumptive MRSA colony detection by the APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis Modules was evaluated with three instruments. Saline was used to evaluate no growth, three dilutions of two MRSA strains (MRSA3 and MRSA9) were used to evaluate presumptive MRSA growth (i.e., mainly confluent, partial confluent, and single colony growth), and three dilutions of two S. haemolyticus strains (SH3 and SH6) were used to evaluate non-presumptive MRSA growth (i.e., mainly confluent, partial confluent, and single colony growth) on BD and TFS/S chromogenic agar plates. Each dilution was plated in triplicate and incubated at $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } 2 \pm ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 24 hours. Five replicate images of each plate were taken at three different orientations ( $0 ^ { \circ }$ , $1 2 0 ^ { \circ }$ and $2 7 0 ^ { \circ }$ ) on three instruments for a total of 135 images per dilution (3 replicate plates x 5 replicate images $\textbf { X } 3$ orientations $_ { \textrm { X 3 } }$ instruments $= 1 3 5$ images per dilution).

Accuracy

The accuracy in which the APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis Modules is able to correctly assign “presumptive MRSA” and “presumptive non- MRSA” colonies was evaluated with a range of organisms noted in Table 4. Organisms were serially diluted in saline and streaked onto BBL CHROMagar MRSA II (BD) and Remel Spectra MRSA (TFS/S) chromogenic agar plates in 2 replicates or 7 replicates to produce either light or confluent growth, respectively, after 24-hour incubation at $3 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . At least 100 isolated colonies per plate were digitally labelled by a microbiologist and compared to the corresponding APAS result.

Results of the accuracy study with the BD and TFS/S analysis modules are shown in Table 7 and Table 8, respectively. The results demonstrate that the APAS Independence can accurately detect presumptive MRSA colonies when grown on BD or TFS/S chromogenic agar plates. However, it cannot accurately detect presumptive non-MRSA colonies. This reduced specificity is acceptable since plates with “no growth” or “presumptive non-MRSA growth” do not pose a risk for patient management and are therefore discarded.

Digital Image Quality Study

A Digital Image Quality study was performed to evaluate the accuracy of microbiologist’s interpretation of a digital image compared to reading the agar plate manually (visual read). The data generated in this study were analyzed in two different ways: microbiologist interpretation of a digital image compared to a manual plate read (Table 9-Table 15) and reproducibility of microbiologists’ interpretation of a digital image read (Table 16).

a) Microbiologist interpretation of APAS-generated digital image compared to manual plate read

The purpose of this study was to assess whether an APAS-generated digital image of a chromogenic agar plate read by a microbiologist can be interpreted equivalent to a manual reading of the chromogenic agar plate (i.e., manual plate read). Three hundred clinical samples (received as swabs and cultured on appropriate agar plates for routine MRSA surveillance) and 100 contrived samples were evaluated. Contrived samples were diluted such that two dilutions were evaluated: medium growth (100-250 CFU/plate) and low growth (1-50 CFU/plate). A panel of three microbiologists blindly interpreted all 400 agar plates and the corresponding 400 digital images that were randomized after a two week “wash out” period to avoid any potential for bias based on prior readings.

A summary of the results with the BD and TFS/S analysis modules is provided in Table 9. Data shown by each microbiologist are provided in Table 10, Table 11 and Table 12 for the BD analysis module as well as in Table 13, Table 14 and Table 15 for the TFS/S analysis module.

1 Percent agreement determined by dividing number of digital image read results by the number of manual plate read results from the same microbiologist for each designation (i.e., “no growth”, “presumptive non-MRSA growth”, “presumptive MRSA growth”).

The digital image quality study determined that an APAS-generated digital image using the BD module can be equivalently interpreted by a microbiologist compared to reading the plate manually (visual read). This was achieved $59 5 \%$ of the time for each of the three result designations. Importantly, MRSA growth agreement was $59 5 \%$ , which is acceptable to support use of a two-rule designation set (i.e., presumptive MRSA growth and negative) in that only plates with presumptive MRSA growth are required for microbiologist review.

The digital image quality study determined that an APAS-generated digital image using the TFS/S module cannot be equivalently interpreted by a microbiologist compared to reading the plate manually. Agreement was ${ < } 9 5 \%$ of the time for each result designation. Importantly, presumptive MRSA growth agreement was $9 3 . 5 \%$ , which is not acceptable to support use of a two-rule designation set. As such, the TFS/S module will use a threerule designation set (i.e., presumptive MRSA growth, presumptive non-MRSA growth, and negative) in that plates with any growth (presumptive MRSA or presumptive nonMRSA) are required for microbiologist review.

# b) Reproducibility of the APAS-generated digital image interpretation

The data obtained from the digital image quality study was further analyzed to evaluate the ability of an APAS-generated digital image to be reproducibly interpreted by a panel of microbiologists. Here, each microbiologist’s interpretation of a digital image was compared to the final panel interpretation of the digital image (i.e., majority result). The study determined that a digital image generated with both the BD and TFS/S analysis modules can be reproducibly interpreted by a microbiologist. This was achieved $59 5 \%$ of the time for each of the three result designations (summarized in Table 16), which is acceptable.

# Microbial Interference

A study was conducted to assess the ability of APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis Modules to accurately detect MRSA in the presence of non-MRSA growth within the recommended incubation time for each respective plate (i.e., 20 – 26 hours for BD and 24 hours for TFS/S chromogenic agar plates).

Two MRSA (MRSA3 and MRSA5) isolates and two non-MRSA (Staphylococcus haemolyticus, SH6 and Staphylococcus warneri, STSP4) organisms were prepared as pure and mixed cultures and diluted accordingly to produce culture plates with mainly confluent growth $( > 1 0 0$ colonies per plate) or light growth (1 – 100 colonies per plate) in five replicates. After 24 hours of incubation, a panel of three microbiologists evaluated the presence or absence of growth and color indicative of MRSA. The majority panel result (i.e., final panel interpretation) was compared to the APAS result to determine agreement for growth and color.

The data provided in Table 17 and Table 18 supports interpretation of the BD and TFS/S chromogenic agar plates after 24 hours of incubation.

# Analytical Specificity / Limit of Blank

A study was conducted to evaluate the potential influence of various external factors on image quality and the ability of the APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis Modules to provide correct results in the presence of known factors. Chromogenic agar plates (BD or TFS/S) were prepared to concurrently simulate a combination of four interference mechanisms (label, applicator, transport media and pen marking). Three blank applicators (flocked swab, cotton swab and $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ loop) were used to inoculate chromogenic agar plates using three different transport media (Stuart Transport, Amies Transport and saline) and no transport media (dry). One of four different labels were applied to plates that were either marked with felt-tip pen or not (3 applicators $\mathtt { x 4 }$ transport media $_ { \textrm { X 4 } }$ labels x 2 marks $= 9 6$ plates per chromogenic agar). Although each interference mechanism was evaluated concurrently (i.e., four variables evaluated on each plate), performance is stratified by each interference variable in Table 19.

In general, the interference variables did interfere with the ability of the APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis Modules to provide accurate “no growth” result, which may produce false positives growth. However, since BD plates with “presumptive MRSA growth” and TFS/S plates with “presumptive MRSA growth” and “presumptive non-MRSA growth” are reviewed by microbiologists before confirmatory testing, the risk for an erroneous result being reported for patient management is mitigated by the review. In addition, plates with “no growth” or “presumptive non-MRSA growth” do not pose a risk for patient management and are therefore discarded.

# Analytical Specificity / Interference

The ability in which the APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis Modules can accurately detect presumptive MRSA and presumptive non-MRSA colonies in the presence of known interferences was evaluated. Three applicators (flocked swab, cotton swab and $1 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ loop) were used to inoculate chromogenic agar plates using two different media (Stuart Transport and Amies Transport). Plates were labelled with one of four different labels applied to the base or side of the plate that were either marked with felt-tip pen or not (3 applicators $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ media $_ { \textrm { X 4 } }$ labels x 2 marks $= 4 8$ plates per organism, per chromogenic agar). One MRSA (MRSA3) and one non-MRSA (S. haemolyticus, SH6) isolate were prepared to a 0.5 McFarland suspension and diluted accordingly to produce predominantly isolated colonies or heavy growth, respectively, when cultured. Plates were incubated at $3 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 24 hours then imaged. Performance is summarized in Table 20.

1 Organism code, as noted in Table 4. 2 Value calculated by dividing the number of images with the expected growth (i.e., growth detected or no growth detected) by the total number of images. 3 Value calculated by dividing the number of images with the expected color (i.e., no color detected) by the total number of images.

In general, the interference variables tested had no impact on the ability of the BD and TFS/S MRSA Analysis Modules to detect presumptive MRSA growth ( $100 \%$ detection). False positive results were obtained with the S. haemolyticus samples; however, the risk of false positive results is mitigated since all plates with “presumptive MRSA growth” are reviewed by a microbiologist prior to confirmatory testing.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

The device labeling indicates that the APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis Module requires daily color calibration and a System Check using dedicated tools provided with the instrument. In addition, daily biological Quality Control testing must be performed using reference culture plates inoculated with a MRSA positive strain (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300). In order to pass, results from the culture media must meet the expected designation (i.e., “presumptive MRSA growth”). There were 22 QC plates tested during the clinical study and 8 QC plates tested during the analytical studies. All QC results passed each day of testing with both the BD and TFS/S MRSA analysis modules.

6. Detection Limit:

# Limit of Detection

A study was conducted to determine the smallest colony size that can be detected by the APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis Modules. The effect of colony size on the ability of APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis Modules to detect presumptive MRSA colonies was evaluated. Two strains of MRSA (MRSA3 and MRSA9) used to evaluate presumptive MRSA growth were prepared as 0.5 McFarland suspensions in saline, diluted and plated in six replicates to grow $< 1 0 0$ colonies per plate. Plates were incubated at $3 6 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ $\pm 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until pinpoint colonies were observed. Then, plates were imaged and returned to the incubator at 1-hour intervals until the colonies on the plates were approximately $2 \mathrm { m m }$ in diameter (up to 24 hours).

Table 21 summarizes the percent of colonies detected by APAS by colony size (pixels and extrapolated mm). The smallest colony size (SCZ) that was detected as presumptive MRSA $59 5 \%$ was determined to be the LoD. The SCZ detected by the BD analysis module was $0 . 8 1 5 \mathrm { m m }$ for MRSA3 and $0 . 9 0 6 \mathrm { m m }$ for MRSA9. The SCZ detected by the TFS/S analysis module was $0 . 6 3 4 \mathrm { m m }$ for MRSA3 and $0 . 5 4 3 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ for MRSA 9.

# C Clinical Studies:

1. Clinical Sensitivity:

The clinical performance of the APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis Modules was evaluated in a two-part study. The overall data from both parts were used collectively in the evaluation of performance.

For part 1 of the clinical study, the goal was to evaluate performance of the APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis Modules by inoculating prospective and contrived clinical samples onto chromogenic agar media and comparing APAS-generated results to a panel (i.e., majority) result. This part of the study was performed at a single clinical site (outside United States, oUS) using remnant swab specimens that were leftover from routine, standard of care testing from various healthcare facilities. Each swab specimen was subjected to PCR testing for the detection of MRSA. Positive PCR samples were sent to a confirmatory lab for culture. Both positive and negative PCR samples were inoculated onto chromogenic agar and shipped to a central laboratory for incubation and imaging. A portion of PCRnegative samples were also used to generate contrived-negative and contrived-positive samples to supplement the study. The on-screen (digital) images were interpreted by a panel of three oUS microbiologists. The majority result was considered the truth state (i.e., final panel interpretation) and used as a comparison to the APAS-generated result.

For part 2 of the clinical study, the goal was to assess the ability of a panel of three US microbiologists to interpret the same set of randomized digital images already acquired and reported in part 1. The microbiologists were blinded to the other interpretations and plate source (clinical or contrived). The majority result was compared to the historical APAS result obtained in the first part of the study.

The following 1590 samples were enrolled in the clinical study:

• 1100 PCR-negative clinical samples • 25 PCR-positive clinical samples 60 PCR-negative, contrived-negative samples 405 PCR-negative, contrived-positive samples

Thirteen samples were excluded from the BD analysis due to defects in the agar resulting in a total of 1573 BD plates analyzed. Ten samples were excluded from the TFS/S analysis due to defects in the agar, resulting in a total of 1580 TFS/S plates analyzed.

Contrived samples were used due to the low incidence of MRSA in the population. This was acceptable since the APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis Modules only images and interprets microbial colonies (i.e., it is not a selective and differential medium). Leftover PCR-negative swab specimens were spiked (1 – 10,000 CFU/plate) with MRSA organisms known to produce a positive reaction on the agar (“presumptive MRSA growth”) or organisms known to grow on the agar but not produce a positive reaction (“presumptive nonMRSA growth”). Some organisms included in the contrived samples are representative of the most common strains from the US, Europe, United King and Australia (Table 22). The other contrived samples were spiked with well-characterized stock clinical isolates obtained by LBT Innovations and identification confirmed using MALDI-TOF with methicillin susceptibility/resistance confirmed using well-accepted methods (i.e., oxacillin MIC assay using an FDA-cleared device or cefoxitin disk diffusion assay).

The overall performances for the BD MRSA and TFS/S MRSA analysis modules were evaluated to determine the possible claims that could be supported and how performance issues could be mitigated. As a result, considering data and supportive metrics from other studies, it was concluded that either a two-designation rule set (i.e., presumptive MRSA growth and negative) or a three-designation rule set (i.e., presumptive MRSA growth, presumptive non-MRSA growth, and negative) would be appropriate.

a) Overall Performance of the APAS Independence with the BD MRSA Analysis Modules

The overall performance of the BD MRSA analysis modules for detection of presumptive MRSA growth (both in the analytical studies and clinical study) is acceptable to support a two-designation rule set (i.e., presumptive MRSA growth and negative). As such, only plates with “presumptive MRSA growth” require review by a microbiologist. The acceptability of the two-designation rule set is based on the following performance metrics:

• $59 5 \%$ agreement for “presumptive MRSA growth” in the digital image quality study (Table 9) • $59 8 \%$ agreement for “presumptive MRSA growth” in part 1 (Table 25) and part 2 clinical data (Table 28) • $59 5 \%$ agreement for “presumptive MRSA growth” when comparing part 1 and part 2 clinical data (Table 29)

b) Overall Performance of the APAS Independence with the TFS/S MRSA Analysis Modules The overall performance of the TFS/S MRSA analysis modules for detection of presumptive MRSA growth (both in the analytical studies and clinical study) is acceptable to support a three-designation rule set (i.e., presumptive MRSA growth, presumptive non-MRSA growth, and negative). As such, all plates with growth (“presumptive MRSA growth” or “presumptive non-MRSA growth) require review by a microbiologist. The acceptability of the three-designation rule set is based on the following performance metrics:

$- 9 5 \%$ agreement for “presumptive MRSA growth” in the digital image quality study (Table 9)   
$59 8 \%$ agreement for “presumptive MRSA growth” in part 1 (Table 25) and part 2 clinical data (Table 28)
