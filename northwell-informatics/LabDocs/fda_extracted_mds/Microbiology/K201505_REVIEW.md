# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen II

The DiaSorin Molecular Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen II assay is intended for use on the LIAISON $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ MDX instrument for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. This test is intended for use as an aid in the differential diagnosis of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV viral infections in humans.

Negative results do not preclude influenza virus or RSV infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.

Performance characteristics for influenza A were established with clinical specimens collected during the 2010/2011 influenza season when 2009 H1N1 influenza and H3N2 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to the state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Positive Control Pack

DiaSorin Molecular’s Simplexa ™Flu A/B & RSV Positive Control Pack is intended to be used as a control with the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct kit and the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen II kit for use on the LIAISON $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ MDX instrument. This control is not intended for use with other assays or systems.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

Special Instrument Requirements:

LIAISON MDX instrument with LIAISON MDX Studio Software

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The system consists of the Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen II assay reagents (supplied in a quantity for 24 reactions), the LIAISON MDX (with LIAISON MDX Studio Software), the Direct Amplification Disc and associated accessories. The LIAISON MDX instrument is a realtime Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) thermocycler used for the identification of nucleic acids from biological specimens. The Direct Amplification Disc (DAD) is compartmentalized into eight separate wedges and up to eight separate specimens or controls may be processed on each disc. Each wedge contains sample and reagent input wells, microfluidic channels and laser activated valves to control the fluid flow, and a reaction chamber. The user adds $5 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of Reaction Mix to the reagent input well and $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of unextracted specimen to the sample input well. The reverse transcription, amplification and detection are performed automatically by the instrument.

# B Principle of Operation:

The Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen II assay uses bi-functional fluorescent probe-primers together with corresponding reverse primers to amplify Flu A, Flu B, RSV and internal control RNA. The assay targets conserved regions of influenza A viruses (matrix gene), influenza B viruses (matrix gene) and RSV (M gene) to identify these viruses in direct nasopharyngeal swabs.

The LIAISON MDX uses fluorescence to quantify the amount of targeted nucleic acid sequences in a sample. The LIAISON MDX has four optical detection channels, allowing for simultaneous detection of up to four targets. Each module is optimized for a specific detection dye based on its spectral characteristics. Each module contains a LED excitation source, filters, lenses and a fiber port. Fluorescence is collected at the fiber port and transmitted to a single photomultiplier detector. A sample is considered positive for a particular target if intensity of the optical reading (fluorescence) crosses a particular threshold before a predetermined cutoff cycle.

An RNA internal control is used to detect RT-PCR failure and/or inhibition.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name:

# LIAISON MDX System

2. Specimen Identification: Barcode scanner or manual entry

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling: Uses direct nasopharyngeal specimens collected in Universal Transport Media (UTM)

The study was conducted at three distinct locations/work environments within the sponsor’s facility to simulate three testing sites, where each site had two designated LIAISON MDX instruments and two dedicated operators. Each of the two operators used a unique lot of the reaction mix (for a total of two lots). Each panel member was tested in three replicates, in two runs per day, over five days, at three locations. A total of 90 measurements (3 replicates x 2 runs/day x 5 days x 3 sites) were generated for each panel member. The study design allowed for evaluation of multiple components of variance.

The data was assessed for (a) qualitative results, i.e., percent agreement with expected results, and (b) quantitative analysis of variance components, i.e., average Ct values and calculated SD and $\% C V$ .

4. Interference

# Microbial Interference

The performance of the Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen II assay was evaluated for its ability to accurately detect influenza A, influenza B, and RSV in the presence of other clinically relevant pathogens. The same panel as above, consisting of 32 potentially inhibitory organisms, was individually spiked into a pool containing low concentrations (approximately 2x LoD) each of the influenza A, influenza B and RSV (A2) viruses. Samples were assayed in three replicates. No inhibition was observed for influenza A, influenza B, or RSV by the organisms at the concentrations shown below.

The results indicate that the assay is subject to competitive inhibition in cases of co-infection, where high levels of influenza A (i.e., $> 2 . 0 \mathrm { \times 1 0 ^ { 3 } T C I D 5 0 / m L } )$ ) will likely suppress the detection of influenza B or RSV when those viruses are present at low levels. A limitation to the labeling has been to disclose this vulnerability of the assay to competitive inhibition from Flu A.

# Interfering Substances

The performance of the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen II assay was evaluated with potentially interfering substances that may be present in nasopharyngeal passages. A total of 10 potentially interfering substances were individually spiked into a pooled nasopharyngeal swab matrix containing influenza A (Influenza A/Hong Kong/8/68), influenza B (Influenza B/Massachusetts/02/2012) and RSV (A2), each at a targeted concentration approximately $2 \mathbf { x }$ LoD; each sample was tested in three replicates. No interference was observed with the substances at the concentrations shown below.

The samples were aliquoted and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 3 days and 7 days. After 7 days of storage in refrigerator, the samples were transferred to a freezer at $\le - 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Frozen samples were subjected to four freeze/thaw cycles and then were tested with the Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen II assay. The study utilized five LIAISON MDX instruments and one lot of the Reaction Mix. At each study time-point, the test samples were removed from the storage conditions and equilibrated to room temperature prior to testing. The stability was evaluated by the change in Ct values from baseline $\mathrm { C t }$ (at day 0).

For Flu A in UTM samples:

a. After storage at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 7 days, the observed average change from the baseline Ct, across all concentration levels, ranged from -0.1 to $0 . 1 \mathrm { C t }$ .   
b. After $4 \ : \mathrm { F / T }$ cycles (7-day storage at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ followed by storage at $- 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ , the observed average change from the baseline $\mathrm { C t }$ , across all concentration levels, ranged from 0.1 to $0 . 6 \mathrm { C t }$ .

For Flu B in UTM samples:

a. after storage at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 7 days, the observed average change from the baseline Ct, across all concentration levels, ranged from -0.1 to $0 . 5 \mathrm { C t }$ .   
b. After $4 \ : \mathrm { F / T }$ cycles (7-day storage at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ followed by storage at $- 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ , the observed change from the baseline Ct, across all concentration levels, ranged from 0.0 to $0 . 3 \ : \mathrm { C t }$ .

For RSV in UTM samples:

a. after storage at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 7 days, the observed average change from the baseline Ct, across all concentration levels, ranged from -0.1 to $0 . 1 \mathrm { C t }$ .   
b. After $4 \ : \mathrm { F / T }$ cycles (7-day storage at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ followed by storage at $- 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ , the observed average change from the baseline Ct, across all concentration levels, ranged from -0.3 to $0 . 1 \mathrm { C t }$ .

The results demonstrated acceptable stability of samples collected in UTM when stored at the above conditions for the time period under evaluation.

# Specimens Collected in Other Collection Media

Additionally, specimen stability was evaluated when samples were collected in three other collection media: Copan ESwab Liquid Amies, Remel M5, and Remel M6. The test samples were prepared by diluting viral stocks of Flu A, Flu B, and RSV into each of the selected media at concentrations ranging from approximately $2 \mathbf { x }$ LoD to $5 0 \mathrm { x }$ LoD. The samples were aliquoted and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for three days, then frozen at $\mathrm { \leq } \mathrm { - } 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , to evaluate three freeze/thaw cycles. The study utilized six LIAISON MDX instruments and one lot of the Reaction Mix. At each study time-point, the test samples were removed from the storage conditions and equilibrated to room temperature prior to testing.

The results demonstrated acceptable stability of samples collected in the three types of media tested, when stored at the above conditions for the time period under evaluation.

The package insert includes the following storage and transport recommendations:

Specimens collected in UTM should be transported on ice and may be stored at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to seven (7) days. Specimens collected in Remel M5, Remel M6, or Copan ESwab™ (Liquid Amies) should be transported on ice and may be stored at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to three (3) days.

# 6. Reaction Mix Open Vial Stability at Room Temperature

The stability of the Reaction Mix after opening was evaluated for room temperature stability at 30 and 60 minutes timepoints. The study was conducted using Positive Control neat and diluted 1:10 in UTM, testing two lots of reagents across two LIAISON MDX instruments. Each neat sample was tested in duplicate at each time point with each lot of reagents. The 1:10 diluted sample was tested in 12 replicates at each timepoint with each lot of reagents. All replicates were detected at all timepoints (0 (after preparation), 30 minutes and 60 minutes) and the observed change in Ct values was $\leq 1 . 2 \%$ for all three targets.

# 7. Quality Controls

External controls, the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Positive Control Pack, are available from DiaSorin and may be used to monitor the assay performance and integrity of the reagents over time.

Three lots of Positive Control were included in the evaluation of the Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen II assay. The summary of the QC results is presented below.

8. Detection Limit:

The Limit of Detection (LoD) study was performed using six LIAISON MDX Instruments, two lots of Reaction Mix and two lots of Positive Control. A total of 67 runs were performed by two operators over three days. The test samples were prepared by diluting viral stocks of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV into pooled nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens collected in UTM. Two strains of each virus were tested. The viral stocks were previously titered in $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ (Tissue Culture Infectious Dose at $50 \%$ per mL) and in copies/mL using digital droplet PCR technique. Each of the virus strains was tested at four or more concentrations near the expected LoD during the initial screening, followed by confirmation testing at one or more concentrations with two lots of the Reaction Mix, in 20 replicates. The LoD was defined as the concentration of the virus that resulted in at least $9 5 \%$ detection during confirmation testing for each of the virus strains.

# 9. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)

The analytical reactivity of the Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen II with various strains of influenza A, influenza B and RSV, was evaluated by testing dilutions of quantified virus stocks prepared by spiking into into pooled negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix (swabs collected in UTM) at concentrations near the LoD. A total of 65 Flu A strains, 25 Flu B strains and 11 RSV strains were tested in three replicates. Samples that were not detected in all three replicates at the initially contrived concentrations were retested at a higher concentration. The strains shown below were positive in all three replicates at the concentrations shown.

Additionally, testing of eight contemporary human influenza viruses was conducted to compare the reactivity of the modified device (Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen II) to the unmodified version (Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct).

Overall, the modified device demonstrated higher analytical reactivity with contemporary strains of human influenza viruses than the original device.

# 10. Assay Cut-Off:

The fluorescent thresholds and assay Ct cutoffs were adjusted to optimize the sensitivity and specificity of the Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen II based on the LoD data and results from testing of $8 8 0 \mathrm { N o }$ -Template-Control samples, using three lots of the Reaction Mix reagents, across 11 LIAISON MDX instruments. The overall positive and negative percent agreements obtained from the method comparison testing with clinical samples were determined to be satisfactory.

# 11. Carry-Over:

The potential for carry-over contamination using the LIAISON MDX instrument was previously evaluated and reviewed under K120413. The study was performed by testing high positive and negative samples in alternate positions on each disc. No carry-over contamination effect was seen in the Flu A, Flu B or RSV channels.

An additional study was conducted with the modified device to evaluate the risk for crosscontamination and to demonstrate the re-usability of the DAD consumable up to eight times.

In the first part of the study, two lots of DADs were evaluated, testing 10 DADs/lot and utilizing 12 LIAISON MDX instruments. Each DAD was used to test two wedges at a time (alternating Positive Control and No Template Control) per run, for four runs per DAD, for a total of 80 measurements for each sample.

No carryover contamination was observed. The summary results are presented below.

In the second part of the study, four DADs were tested using Positive Control (PC) and Universal Transport Media (UTM) as a No Template Control (NTC). Since each Disc can accommodate up to eight samples, the purpose of the study was to demonstrate that each disc can be used up to eight times, without a risk of contamination Each wedge of the DAD was run one wedge at a time per run for a total of eight runs per DAD and 16 replicates of each sample.

No carryover contamination was observed. The summary results are presented below.

# B Comparison Studies:

# 1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A clinical agreement study was performed using retrospective pre-selected positive and negative leftover nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens collected in $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ Universal Transport Media (UTM) from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection. The specimens were collected at three collection sites at two geographical locations. A total of 240 pre-selected positive and negative nasopharyngeal swabs, collected between January 24, 2018 and December 15, 2019, were included in the evaluation. The specimens were shipped on dry ice and stored at $\le - 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until testing. All specimens were pre-selected for positive and negative status based on routine laboratory results at the collection sites. The specimens were re-blinded and randomized prior to distributing them to the internal clinical testing site at DiaSorin Molecular. Each specimen was tested using the predicate device, Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct, and the modified device, Simplexa Flu

A/B & RSV Direct Gen II. Any sample with discordant results was tested with another FDA cleared molecular assay. Six LIAISON MDX instruments were used in the evaluation.

The following tables show the results from the method comparison testing.
