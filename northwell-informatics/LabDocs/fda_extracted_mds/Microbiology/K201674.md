Dear Alex Bohorquez:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part

801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice (https://www.fda.gov/medical  
devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance) and CDRH Learn   
(https://www.fda.gov/training-and-continuing-education/cdrh-learn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic. See the DICE website (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatoryassistance/contact-us-division-industry-and-consumer-education-dice) for more information or contact DICE by email (DICE@fda.hhs.gov) or phone (1-800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100).

Performance Testing:

# Culture-Based Studies

Performance of the Cultura Collection and Transport System was evaluated for virus viability using commercial strains of Influenza A, Influenza B, RSV, and Rhinovirus. 600 µL of organism suspension was used to inoculate the Cultura VTM in quadruplicate and stored for 0, 48 hrs., 72 hrs., and 120 hrs. at 2- $8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ and at controlled room temperature $( 2 3 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . At each timepoint, an aliquot of the Cultura VTM and organism suspension was inoculated into the appropriate host cell line. All the cultures were processed using the standard laboratory culture technique. Organism viability was determined by the Reed-Muench method calculation of TCID50.

# Performance Data

Merit Cultura™ Collection and Transport System preserved the samples of all the organisms tested for up to 120 hours at both controlled room temperature and refrigerated. The organisms evaluated and the results obtained are given in Table 1 below. The table below represents the titer of virus inoculated at T-0. The word “present” confirms the viability of the virus.

# Amplification-Based Studies

Performance of the Cultura Collection and Transport System was evaluated by Real-Time PCR amplification studies using 12 unique, SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens. Testing has been performed in triplicate to show the suitability of the Cultura VTM for the preservation of nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) for down-stream nucleic acid extraction and molecular testing when VTM and collection samples are stored per the instructions provided.

Nucleic acid was detected using the CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (catalog No. 2019-nCoVEUA-01). The rRT-PCR enzyme used in the master mix was the Thermofisher TaqPath™ $\harpoonleft$ -Step RT-qPCR Master Mix (catalog No. A15299). RNA was extracted using the Qiagen QIAcube using the QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (catalog No. 52906) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were run on the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx PCR System with SDS version 1.4 software (catalog No. 4406985). $\scriptstyle { \mathsf { T } } = 0$ hours, $\top = 7 2$ hours, $\mathtt { T } = 1 2 0$ hours, and ${ \mathsf { T } } { = } 2 4 0$ hours samples were stored in temperature-controlled environments of ${ 2 / 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } }$ and $2 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Results show $100 \%$ concordance of the qualitative result $\mathrm { ( C t < 4 0 }$ is a positive result). Ct values were stable for all samples according to lot number, incubation time, or storage condition. See below for details.
