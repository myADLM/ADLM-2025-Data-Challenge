5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

Shelf life: The shelf life for the Merit Cultura Collection and Transport System was determined to be 12 months from the date of manufacture. The shelf life of the Merit Cultura Collection and Transport System was established using an accelerated stability study. Accelerated stability was assessed by storing components at $5 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with a relative humidity (RH) of $8 . 7 \% \pm 5 \%$ for 57 days to simulate storage at $2 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with an RH of $50 \%$ for 18 months.

Results were elaborated by calculation of expected real time stability using the Arrhenius equation on a total of three lots. Shelf life stability was assessed using residual clinical specimens at the Wyoming Public Health Laboratory using the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. Extraction was performed on the Qiagen QIAcube using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, and testing was performed on the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx PCR System with SDS v1.4 software, according to the CDC 2019-nCoV RT-PCR assay Instructions for Use. Lots subjected to accelerated stability testing were spiked with one positive specimen in triplicate, one negative specimen, and a control containing nuclease free water. Samples were held at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \left( \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \right)$ until hour 240 with aliquots taken at time 0, 120 and 240. All replicates at all timepoints gave a positive result $\mathrm { ( C t < 4 0 ) }$ ; the negative controls also performed as expected.

Real-time stability testing was conducted concurrently and is continuing to verify shelf life and determine if it can be extended beyond the current labeled shelf life of 12 months.

Sterilization: The Cultura Collection and Transport System VTM is provided to the end user as a sterile media per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Standard Operating Procedure: “Preparation of Viral Transport Medium.” 1 The manufacturing process includes sterilization by gamma radiation set at a dose of 25 KiloGray (KGy) in accordance with ISO

$1 1 1 3 7 - 2 : 2 0 1 5 ^ { 2 }$ . Sterility was confirmed using sterility checks in lots subjected to accelerated stability testing demonstrating no growth detected.

Transport: The stability of the Merit Cultura Collection and Transport System during transport was established using a simulated transport study. Extreme simulated transport testing was performed in accordance with ISO $2 2 3 3 { : } 2 0 0 0 ^ { 3 }$ : 9 hours at $- 3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ at ambient RH (Condition #2) followed by 9 hours at $2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and $90 \%$ RH (Condition $\# 6$ ) followed by 9 hours at $5 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ at $30 \%$ RH (Condition # 12), with 2 hours of ramp time between conditions and 24 hours of equilibrium time at ambient lab conditions at the end. Simulated distribution testing was performed in accordance with ASTM $\mathrm { D } 4 1 6 9 - 1 6 ^ { 4 }$ , Distribution Cycle DC-13, Assurance Level II to include simulations of product handling, vehicle stacking, loose load vibration, and vehicle vibration.

Performance testing demonstrated that the candidate device provides adequate protection of the contents during normal handling, transit, and storage.

6. Detection Limit:

Viral Recovery:

Culture-Based Viral Recovery Studies: Performance of the Merit Cultura Collection and Transport System was evaluated for virus viability at different incubation times and temperatures.

Stock Preparation. Strains of Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A (H1N1) virus, influenza B virus (IBV), and rhinovirus 14 were used for media validation. The following cell lines were obtained from ATCC and used for viral recovery: HEp-2 (for RSV), MDCK (for H1N1 and IBV), and H1-HeLa (for rhinovirus). Ten-fold serial dilutions were performed in cell culture medium (MEM with $10 \%$ FBS) and inoculated into the susceptible host cell line. Host cells were plated at a suitable density in cell culture medium in microwell plates 24 hours prior to inoculation. Virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) of each dilution was determined by microscopic observation.

Estimated Limit of Detection $( L o D )$ . The LoD was determined. Virus was inoculated in 1, 10, and 100 particles in replicates of 3 into the susceptible host cell line. Host cells were plated at a suitable density in cell culture medium in microwell plates 1-2 days prior to testing. Virusinduced CPE of each dilution was determined in replicates of 4. The LoD is the minimum concentration of virus that can be reliably detected (CPE $\mathrm { i n } \geq 5 0 \%$ wells). The LoD was determined to be 1-9 virus particles for all viruses.

Viability Assay. Virus was inoculated to attain $2 \mathbf { x }$ LoD ( ${ \sim } 1 0$ viral particles) in replicates of 4 into 3 lots of Merit VTM $6 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ in $2 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ ). Tubes were stored refrigerated (2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) or at ambient temperature (23 to $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) up to 5 days. Aliquots of each replicate were recovered at 0, 48, 72 or 120 hours, serially diluted, and inoculated in replicates of 4 into the susceptible host cell line. Host cells were plated at a suitable density in culture medium in microwell

plates 1-2 days prior to testing. The following controls were run: a viability control containing no virus to ensure cell viability and no contamination; a virus control containing virus stock to ensure infectivity of virus; a cytotoxicity control containing Merit VTM to observe any CPE from the VTM; and, a recovery control containing virus in culture medium stored and tested under the same conditions as the test samples. Viability was determined by microscopic observation of virus induced CPE to determine the fifty-percent tissue culture infective dose $\mathrm { ( T C I D } _ { 5 0 } )$ . The Reed-Muench method was used: $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } { } =$ $\%$ mortality above $5 0 \% - 5 0 \% )$ / $\%$ mortality above $50 \% - \%$ mortality below $5 0 \% \times 1 0 \mathrm { g }$ of the dilution factor. Table 2 shows $\mathrm { T C I D } { \scriptstyle 5 0 }$ values of replicates for each virus tested at time 0 and viral recovery at storage times (T0 and T120 hours) and temperatures $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $2 3 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ).

Merit VTM demonstrated virus viability of RSV, IAV and rhinovirus for all replicates in all lots, incubation times, and storage temperatures. For IBV, Merit VTM demonstrated virus viability of all undiluted samples $( 2 \mathrm { x } \ \mathrm { L o D } )$ , but at a $1 0 ^ { - 1 }$ dilution (below LoD) some replicates demonstrated a loss of viability. The studies demonstrate that the Merit Cultura Collection and Transport System maintains the viability of all viruses tested out to 120 hours at refrigerated $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and ambient $( 2 3 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ ) temperatures.

Amplification-Based Studies: Performance of the Merit Cultura Collection and Transport System was evaluated by amplification of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid.

Extraction and Downstream Amplification. Molecular testing was performed with 12 unique SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens at the Wyoming Public Health Laboratory using the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel, which detects SARS-CoV-2 (N1 and N2 nucleoprotein) markers. Extraction was performed on the Qiagen QIAcube using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, and testing was performed on the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx PCR System with SDS v1.4 software, according to the CDC 2019-nCoV RT-PCR assay Instructions for Use.

Serial dilutions of specimens from the SereCare AccuPlex SARS-CoV-2 Verification Panel were spiked in the Merit Cultura Collection and Transport System at the LoD of the CDC 2019-nCoV RT-PCR assay to confirm that results are comparable to the LoD of the original authorization. The results confirmed that the LoD is at 1,000 copies/mL (20/20 positive, mean N1 $\mathrm { C t } { = } 3 5 . 1 3$ , mean N $\ ! { \mathrm { C t } } { = } 3 7 . 2 9 $ ).

For verification and evaluation of acceptable specimen transport time and temperature, 12 clinical specimens were spiked in triplicate at a dilution of 1:10 ( $3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ in $3 \mathrm { m L }$ ) into each of

3 lots of Merit VTM at time (T) 0, 72 hours, 120 hours, and 216 hours. Samples were selected to span the range of $\mathrm { C t }$ values (low, mid-range and high). Samples were stored at 2 different temperatures: $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $2 3 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The tables below show mean Ct values obtained from testing of 9 replicates (3 replicates $\times 3$ lots) for each sample at each timepoint and the difference in $\mathrm { C t } \left( \Delta \mathrm { C t } \right)$ between time 0 and the specimen stability claim of 120 hours. Results are presented according to storage temperature (Tables 3 and 4).
