# 1. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

cobas® BKV is based on fully automated sample preparation (nucleic acid extraction and purification) followed by PCR amplification and detection. The cobas® 6800/8800 Systems consist of the sample supply module, the transfer module, the processing module, and the analytic module. Automated data management is performed by the cobas® 6800/8800 software which assigns test results for all tests as either target not detected, BKV DNA detected $<$ LLoQ (lower limit of quantitation), BKV DNA detected $>$ ULoQ (upper limit of quantitation), or a value in the linear range $\mathrm { L L o Q } < \mathbf { x } < \mathrm { U L o Q }$ . Results can be reviewed directly on the system screen, exported, or printed as a report.

Nucleic acid from patient samples and added lambda DNA-QS molecules is simultaneously extracted. In summary, viral nucleic acid is released by addition of proteinase and lysis reagent to the sample. The released nucleic acid binds to the silica surface of the added magnetic glass particles. Unbound substances and impurities, such as denatured protein, cellular debris and potential PCR inhibitors are removed with subsequent wash reagent steps and purified nucleic acid is eluted from the glass particles with elution buffer at elevated temperature.

Selective amplification of target nucleic acid from the sample is achieved by the use of a dual target virus specific approach from highly-conserved regions of the BKV located in the BKV small t-antigen region and the BKV VP2 region. Selective amplification of DNA-QS is achieved by the use of sequence-specific forward and reverse primers which are selected to have no homology with the BKV genome. A thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme is used for amplification. The target and DNA-QS sequences are amplified simultaneously utilizing a universal PCR amplification profile with predefined temperature steps and number of cycles. The master mix includes deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP), instead of deoxythimidine triphosphate (dTTP), which is incorporated into the newly synthesized DNA (amplicon).1-3 Any contaminating amplicon from previous PCR runs is eliminated by the AmpErase enzyme, which is included in the PCR mix, when heated in the first thermal cycling step. However, newly formed amplicons are not eliminated since the AmpErase enzyme is inactivated once exposed to temperatures above $5 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

The cobas® BKV master mix contains two detection probes specific for BKV target sequences and one for the DNA-QS. The probes are labeled with target-specific fluorescent reporter dyes allowing simultaneous detection of BKV target and DNA-QS in two different target channels.4,5 The fluorescent signal of the intact probes is suppressed by the quencher dye. During the PCR amplification step, hybridization of the probe to the specific single-stranded DNA templates results in cleavage by the $5 "$ -to-3' nuclease activity of the DNA polymerase resulting in separation of the reporter and quencher dyes and the generation of a fluorescent signal. With each PCR cycle, increasing amounts of cleaved probes are generated and the cumulative signal of the reporter dye is concomitantly increased. Real-time detection and discrimination of PCR products are accomplished by measuring the fluorescence of the released reporter dyes for the viral targets and DNA-QS.

# 4. NON-CLINICAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

# 4.1. Limit of Detection (LoD)

The limit of detection (LoD) of cobas® BKV was determined by analysis of serial dilutions of the WHO International Standard (subgroup Ib) and verified for subgroups Ia, Ic and subtypes II, III and IV. The overall concentration for which $9 5 \%$ hit rate is expected by PROBIT is 21.5 $\mathrm { I U / m L }$ for EDTA plasma.

# 4.1.1. WHO International Standard

The limit of detection of cobas® BKV for the WHO International Standard was determined by analysis of serial dilutions of the $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ WHO BKV International Standard obtained from NIBSC (NIBSC 14/212)6 , in BKV-negative human EDTA plasma. Panels of six concentration levels plus a blank were tested over three lots of cobas® BKV reagents, multiple runs, days, operators, and instruments.

The results for EDTA plasma are shown in Table 2 through Table 4. The study demonstrates that with the least sensitive lot, the concentration for which $9 5 \%$ hit rate is expected by PROBIT is $2 1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ with a $9 5 \%$ confidence range of $1 6 . 3 - 3 2 . 4 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ in EDTA plasma. The lowest concentration with a hit rate $\ge 9 5 \%$ is $1 9 . 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ in EDTA plasma.

# 4.3. Traceability to the 1st WHO International Standard for BK Virus for Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques (NAT)-based Assays

Several standards and controls have been used during development of this test to provide traceability to the WHO standard [the 1st WHO International Standard for BK Virus DNA $( \mathrm { N I B S C } 1 4 / 2 1 2 ) ^ { 6 } ]$ . The standards used during development of the test include the BKV WHO Standard, the RMS BKV Secondary Standard, and the RMS BKV Calibration Panel. The Standards and the Calibration Panel were tested. The concentration range tested for the BKV WHO Standard was from $1 . 9 0 \mathrm { E + 0 1 \ I U / m L }$ to $2 . 0 0 \mathrm { E } { + } 0 4 ~ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ $1 . 2 8 { - } 4 . 3 0 \log _ { 1 0 } \mathrm { { I U } / m L ) }$ , the RMS BKV Secondary Standard was tested at $1 . 8 6 \mathrm { E + } 0 4 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ (4.27 log10 IU/mL), and the RMS BKV Calibration Panel was tested from $1 . 0 0 \mathrm { E } { + } 0 3 ~ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to $5 . 0 0 \mathrm { E + } 0 8 ~ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ (3.00-8.70 log10 IU/mL).

The calibration and standardization process of cobas BKV provides quantitation values for the calibration panel, the RMS BKV Secondary Standard, and the BKV WHO Standard that are

similar to the expected values with deviation of not more than 0.19 log10 IU/mL (Figure 2).   
The maximum deviation was obtained at $1 9 . 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ (approximately LLoQ).

# 4.4. Linear Range

Linearity of cobas® BKV was evaluated using a dilution series consisting of 18 panel members with BKV subgroup Ib DNA spanning the assay linear range. A high titer lambda DNA stock was used to prepare 11 panel members spanning the entire linear range. A clinical specimen was used to prepare seven panel members covering the intermediate - and lower levels of the linear range.

Each panel member was tested in 36 replicates across three lots of cobas® BKV reagents and the results of the study are presented in Figure 3.

cobas® BKV was demonstrated to be linear from $1 . 0 1 \mathrm { E } { + 0 1 }$ to $1 . 9 7 \mathrm { E } { + 0 8 } \mathrm { I U } / \mathrm { m L }$ and shows an absolute deviation from the better fitting non-linear regression of less or equal than $\ v { a } _ { \cdot } \pm 0 . 1 \log _ { 1 0 } $ in human EDTA plasma (see Figure 3). Across the linear range, the accuracy of the test was within $\pm 0 . 2 \log _ { 1 0 }$ .

The lower limit of quantitation (LLoQ) is $2 1 . 5 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ , calculated based on a goal for acceptable total analytical error (TAE) of $\leq 1 . 0 \log _ { 1 0 }$ , where $\mathrm { T A E } = | \mathbf { b i a s } | + 2$ standard deviations in alignment with the CLSI EP-17A guideline, and TAE $=$ SQUARE ROOT(2) x 2 standard deviations based on the “difference between 2 measurements” approach.

Based on the LLoQ and the determined linear range, as well as the medical value the linear measurement range of the test was set to $2 1 . 5 { \mathrm { - } } 1 . 0 { \mathrm { E } } { \mathrm { + } } 0 8 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ . The results of calculation and claimed LLoQ are shown in Table 6.

# 4.5. Linearity for Subgroups Ia, Ic and subtypes II, III and IV

The dilution series used in the verification of subgroup/subtype linearity study of cobas® BKV consisted of eight panel members spanning the linear range of the assay. Testing was conducted with three lots of cobas® BKV reagent, 12 replicates per level were tested in EDTA plasma. The results of the study are presented in Table 6.

The linearity within the linear range of cobas® BKV was verified for subgroups Ia, Ic and subtypes II, III and IV. The maximum deviation between the linear regression and the better fitting non-linear regression was equal to or less than $\pm 0 . 2 \log _ { 1 0 }$ .

# 4.6. Lower Limit of Quantitation

The analysis for LLoQ was performed with data obtained from the LoD study at concentration levels of $1 9 . 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ , $3 8 . 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ and $8 0 . 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ . The LLoQ is the lowest titer within the linear range that is not lower than the LoD and meets the acceptance criteria for the Total Analytical Error $( | \mathrm { B i a s } | + 2 \mathrm { x } :$ SD) (TAE) and the difference between two measurements. The acceptance criteria for both is $\leq 1 . 0 \log _ { 1 0 } \mathrm { { I U / m L } }$ .

The results of calculation and claimed LLoQ are shown in Table 7 the lower limit of quantitation (LLoQ) is $2 1 . 5 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

# 4.7. Precision – Within Laboratory

Precision of cobas® BKV was determined by analysis of serial dilutions of high titer BKV DNA (subgroup Ib) in BKV-negative EDTA plasma. Six dilution levels were tested in 72 replicates for each level across three lots of cobas® BKV reagents using four instruments and two operators over 12 days. Each sample was carried through the entire cobas® BKV procedure on fully automated cobas® 6800/8800 Systems. Therefore, the precision reported here represents all aspects of the test procedure. The results are shown in Table 8. The results of the variance component estimation are shown in Table 9.

cobas® BKV showed high precision for three lots of reagents tested across a concentration range of $5 . 9 0 \mathrm { E } { + } 0 1 ~ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to $9 . 8 3 \mathrm { E } \mathrm { + } 0 5 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

# 4.8. Analytical Specificity

The analytical specificity of cobas® BKV was evaluated by testing a panel of microorganisms at a concentration of $1 . 0 0 \mathrm { E } { + 0 6 }$ units $ { \mathrm { / m L } }$ (CFU/mL, cells/mL, CCU/mL, IFU/mL) for bacteria and yeast and between $1 . 0 0 \mathrm { E } { + } 0 5$ units/mL and $1 . 0 0 \mathrm { E } { + } 0 6 $ units/mL (copies/mL, $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ , $\mathrm { I U / m L }$ , cells/mL) for viruses. Microorganisms were diluted into BKV DNA negative human EDTA plasma as well as human EDTA plasma containing ( $1 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ ) BKV DNA. The specific organisms tested are listed in Table 10. Each sample was tested in replicates of three. None of the non-BKV pathogens interfered with test performance at the concentrations tested. Negative results were obtained with cobas® BKV for all microorganism samples without BKV target and positive results were obtained for all of the microorganism samples with BKV target.

Furthermore, the mean $\log _ { 1 0 }$ titer of each of the positive BKV samples containing potentially cross-reacting organisms was within $\pm 0 . 5 \log _ { 1 0 }$ of the mean $\log _ { 1 0 }$ titer of the respective positive spike control.

# 4.9. Interfering Substances

Elevated levels of triglycerides $( 3 7 \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ , conjugated bilirubin $( 0 . 2 \ \mathrm { g / L } )$ , unconjugated bilirubin $( 0 . 2 \ \mathrm { g / L } )$ , albumin $( 6 0 ~ \mathrm { g / L } )$ , hemoglobin $( 2 \ \mathrm { g / L } )$ and human DNA $( 2 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ ) in samples were tested in the presence ( $1 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L } )$ and absence of BKV DNA. The tested endogenous interferences were shown not to interfere with the test performance of cobas® BKV.

In addition, drug compounds listed in Table 11 were tested at three times the $\mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ in presence $[ 1 0 0 \mathrm { \ : I U / m L } ]$ and absence of BKV DNA.

All potentially interfering substances have been shown to not interfere with the test performance. Negative results were obtained with cobas® BKV for all samples without BKV target and positive results were obtained on all of the samples with BKV target. Furthermore, the mean

$\log _ { 1 0 }$ titer of each of the positive BKV samples containing potentially interfering substances was within $\pm 0 . 5 \log _ { 1 0 } { }$ of the mean $\log _ { 1 0 }$ titer of the respective positive spike control.

# 4.10. Cross Contamination

The cross-contamination rate for cobas® BKV was determined by testing 240 replicates of a BKV-negative matrix sample and 225 replicates of a high titer BKV DNA sample at approximately $2 . 0 0 \mathrm { E + } 0 7 ~ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ . In total, five runs were performed with positive and negative samples in a checkerboard configuration.

All 240 replicates of the negative sample were negative, resulting in a cross-contamination rate of $0 \%$ (upper one-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence interval $1 . 2 4 \%$ ).

# 5. CLINICAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

# 5.1. Reproducibility of cobas® BKV

The reproducibility of cobas® BKV was evaluated across factors (reagent lot, test site, batch and testing days) that could affect reported results in routine clinical testing. The evaluation was conducted at 3 testing sites, using 3 reagent lots per site, of a positive and a negative sample panel with a total number 270 tests per concentration (not including controls). The panels were made from EDTA plasma that was BKV VCA IgG negative and were tested for BKV with a plasma NAT release protocol, and spiked with a BKV WHO international standard, or BKV genotype Ib (most common genotype) cultured virus DNA. Two operators at each site tested each of three reagent lots for 5 days. One run per operator ( $1 \mathrm { r u n } = 1$ batch; 1 batch $= 1$ panel $^ { + 3 }$ controls) was performed each day and 3 replicates of each panel member were included in each run.

cobas® BKV showed excellent clinical reproducibility at concentrations throughout the linear range. In addition, the system detected $100 \%$ of the $3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ }$ LLoQ samples. The cobas® 6800 and cobas® 8800 Systems share a modular design and they showed equivalency when using cobas® BKV. All of the estimated $9 5 \%$ confidence limits (CLs) for the difference between 2 measurements from the same subject were within $\pm 0 . 8 4 \log _ { 1 0 }$ copies/mL, indicating that the assay can assess changes in BKV DNA levels that are thought to be clinically significant.

Of the 270 valid tests for the negative panel members performed on the cobas® 6800/8800 Systems, all samples showed a “Target Not Detected” result, therefore the negative percent agreement (NPA) was $100 \%$ with the $9 5 \%$ Exact CI of $9 8 . 6 \%$ to $100 \%$ .

# 5.2. Clinical Performance of cobas® BKV

The clinical performance of cobas® BKV was further evaluated at three testing sites by measuring BKV DNA levels in clinical samples (neat and diluted) of BKV infected and non-infected patients and contrived EDTA plasma samples spiked with cultured BKV virus, compared with a well-established laboratory developed nucleic acid test (LDT) (comparator BKV LDT).

From all samples tested with cobas® BKV and the comparator BKV test, there were a total of 550 samples (217 neat and 303 diluted clinical samples from 129 transplant subjects and 30 contrived samples) that were valid on both assays and evaluable for the clinical concordance analysis (Table 13).

Note: $\mathrm { { C I } = }$ Confidence Interval; $\operatorname { L L o Q } =$ lower limit of quantitation of Comparator BKV LDT $\left( 2 0 0 \mathrm { I U / m L } \right)$ ). Standard Deviation of Comparator BKV LDT estimated at $0 . 3 7 \log _ { 1 0 } \mathrm { I U / m L }$ (from Indiana University BKV LDT analytical precision study).   
Analyte concentration of $3 . 0 \log _ { 1 0 } \mathrm { I U / m L }$ represented $\mathrm { L L o Q } + 2 \sigma \mathrm { , 3 . 7 \ l o g _ { 1 0 } I U / m L }$ represented $\mathrm { L L o Q } + 4 \sigma$ and $4 . 4 \log _ { 1 0 }$ $\mathrm { I U / m L }$ represented $\mathrm { L L o Q } + 6 \sigma$ with a range interval of $2 \sigma$ . Paired samples evaluable for clinical concordance analysis were included in this table. aAssumed independence between all samples.

Discordant results were defined as those that are more than one box away from the diagonal (indicated by shading). For Target Not Detected (TND) by LDT Column Agreement the cobas®

BKV Target Not Detected and $< \mathrm { L L o Q } ( < 2 . 3 )$ cells were combined. The rationale for adding the adjacent <LLoQ and TND cells for the TND column is that the difference between a TND and <LLoQ is not clinically meaningful and that these are analytically at the lower end of the measuring range, which may be impacted by random error.

Of the 43 BKV DNA-negative samples collected for the estimation of the NPA with the cobas® BKV, all 43 samples were negative by cobas® BKV, therefore the NPA was $100 \%$ with the $9 5 \%$ Exact CI of $9 1 . 8 \%$ to $100 \%$ .

Concordance between cobas® BKV and the comparator BKV LDT was also evaluated using different clinical thresholds (Table 14).

Note: Samples with a Target Not Detected results were categorised as $<$ <threshold value in $\mathrm { I U / m L }$ . $\operatorname { L L o Q } =$ lower limit of quantitation of Comparator BKV LDT $( 2 0 0 \mathrm { I U / m L } = 2 . 3 \mathrm { l o g _ { 1 0 } I U / m L } )$ . $9 5 \%$ confidence interval (CI) calculated by Score method assuming independence between all samples. \* Thresholds of $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { I U / m l } = 3 . 0$ Log10 IU/ml and $1 0 , 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m l } = 4 . 0$ Log10 $\mathrm { I U } / \mathrm { m l } .$ .

From all samples tested with cobas® BKV that were BKV positive with the comparator BKV test, there were a total of 313 (133 neat and 159 diluted clinical samples from 68 transplant subjects and 21 contrived samples), which were evaluable for the correlation analysis at the three testing sites (Figure 4).

Additional bias plot analysis of DNA level differences indicated a systematic difference between both assays that is constant across the overlapping linear range. The $9 5 \%$ CI of the intercept of the fitted line in the bias plots was (-0.404 to -0.168), which is within $\pm 0 . 7 4 \log 1 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ $( \pm 2$ times analytical precision standard deviation of comparator BKV LDT). Furthermore, the mean bias was estimated at - $- 0 . 3 5 7 \log 1 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ and using the equation of the fitted line in the bias plots, the systematic difference between both assays was $- 0 . 3 4 3 \log 1 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ and -0.362 $\mathrm { l o g l 0 I U / m L }$ for samples with DNA levels at 3 and $4 \log 1 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ , respectively.

# 6. CONCLUSIONS

The conclusions drawn from the nonclinical and clinical studies demonstrate that the device is as safe, as effective, and performs as well as the predicate device.
