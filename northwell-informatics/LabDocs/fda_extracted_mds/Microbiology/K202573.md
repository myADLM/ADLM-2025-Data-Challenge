# KIT DESCRIPTION:

The LIAISON® Lyme IgM assay is an indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) for the qualitative detection of IgM antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in human serum and plasma samples. All assay steps (with the exception of magnetic particle resuspension) and incubations are performed by the Analyzer. The principal components of the test are magnetic particles (solid phase) coated with recombinant Borrelia antigens and a conjugate reagent containing an anti-human IgM mouse monoclonal antibody linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-antibody conjugate). During the first incubation, anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies present in calibrators, samples or controls bind to the solid phase. Unbound material is then removed with a wash cycle. During the second incubation, the antibody conjugate reacts with anti-Borrelia burgdorferi IgM antibodies that have bound to the solid phase. Excess antibody conjugate is then removed with a wash cycle. Subsequently, the starter reagents are added and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is induced. The light signal, and hence the amount of isoluminol-antibody conjugate, is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is indicative of the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi IgM antibodies present in calibrators, samples or controls.

# Modified Two Tier Testing Methodology – Prospective Population

All 2621 prospective (all comer) specimens were tested with the first-tier assay, LIAISON® Lyme Total Antibody Plus. There were 202 positive and 23 equivocal results. In the STTT protocol, the specimens that are positive or equivocal $( n = 2 2 5 )$ are then tested with a B. burgdorferi (IgM) Western Blot.

Using the MTTT algorithm, the positive/equivocal specimens $( n = 2 2 5 )$ were tested on the LIAISON® Lyme IgM assay. The second-tier LIAISON® Lyme IgM equivocal and positive results were considered positive. The equivocal and positive results were added together, and the results compared with the STTT positive results. The results obtained are shown in Table 5.

# Modified Two Tier Testing Methodology-Retrospective population

The 280 retrospective samples from the CDC were first tested with the LIAISON® Lyme Total Antibody Plus. One (1) sample, belonging to endemic negative control group, did not have sufficient volume for testing; therefore 279 retrospective samples were evaluated. The LIAISON® Lyme Total Antibody Plus assay yielded 82 positive and equivocal samples. The 82 positive and equivocal samples were then tested by the IgM Western Blot (STTT) or the $\mathsf { L } | \mathsf { A } | \mathsf { S } \mathsf { O } \mathsf { N } ^ { \otimes }$ Lyme IgM assay (MTTT).

# PRECISION STUDY

A 12 day precision/repeatability was conducted at DiaSorin Inc. on 2 lots of the LIAISON® Lyme IgM assay. Six (6) serum samples and two (2) lots of $\mathsf { L } | \mathsf { A } | \mathsf { S } \mathsf { O N } ^ { \circledast }$ Lyme IgM Controls were tested for 12 days, 2 runs/day, and 2 reps per run by multiple technicians for a total of 48 replicates per lot spanning 2 calibration cycles. One (1) lot is presented below. The CLSI Document EP5-A3 was consulted in the preparation of the testing protocol.

# REPRODUCIBILITY STUDY

A five (5) day precision/reproducibility study was performed internally at DiaSorin Inc. and at two (2) external U.S. laboratories with one (1) lot of the LIAISON® Lyme IgM assay.

The study was performed for 5 days, 2 runs/day, and 3 replicates/run. Each day, two operators, at each testing site performed the testing for a total of 30 replicates at each site. CLSI document EP15-A3 was consulted in the preparation of the testing protocol.

# CROSS-REACTIVITY STUDY

The cross-reactivity study was designed to evaluate 191 specimens from nineteen (19) disease states either known to contain potentially cross reactive antibodies to B. burgdorferi or from patients with diagnoses that can exhibit signs and symptoms similar to Lyme disease and cause false positive results.

# INTERFERING SUBSTANCES

“Controlled studies of potentially interfering substances from endogenous interferents spiked into serum specimens containing B. burgdorferi IgM antibodies at levels near the cut-off showed that assay performance was not affected at the concentration for each substance listed below. The testing was based on CLSI-EP7-A3.

# MATRIX EQUIVALENCE STUDY:

Thirty-two (32) matched patient sets of serum, SST serum, $\mathsf { K } _ { 2 }$ -EDTA plasma and lithium heparin plasma samples were tested to determine if these sample types provide equivalent results. Sample regression analysis was done by Passing & Bablok regression. All sample types met acceptance criteria for use in the LIAISON® Lyme IgM assay. A summary of the results are shown in the following table.
