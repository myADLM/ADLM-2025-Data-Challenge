III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

B Indication(s) for Use: LIAISON Lyme IgM

The LIAISON Lyme IgM assay uses chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) technology for the qualitative detection of IgM antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in human serum and plasma (K2- EDTA, Li-heparin) specimens. This assay is intended for use on samples from patients with signs and symptoms consistent with or patients suspected of having Lyme disease to assess the presence of IgM antibodies and exposure to Borrelia burgdorferi. In addition, the LIAISON Lyme IgM assay may be used as a confirmatory test in the Modified Two-tiered test (MTTT) methodology in combination with the DiaSorin LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus assay.

If used as a first stage test, positive or equivocal results with the LIAISON Lyme IgM assay should be confirmed through additional testing with a Standard Two-Tiered test (STTT) methodology using an IgM Borrelia burgdorferi Western blot test following current guidelines.

Positive supplemental results are supportive evidence of the presence of antibodies and exposure to Borrelia burgdorferi and may be used along with patient history, symptoms and other laboratory data to support a clinical diagnosis of Lyme disease.

Negative results by the LIAISON Lyme IgM assay should not be used to exclude Lyme disease.

The test must be performed on the LIAISON XL Analyzer.

# LIAISON Lyme IgM Control Set

The LIAISON Lyme IgM Control Set is intended for use as assayed quality control samples to monitor the performance of the LIAISON Lyme IgM assay. The performance characteristics of LIAISON Lyme IgM controls have not been established for any other assays or instrument platforms different from the LIAISON XL.

# LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus

The LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus assay uses chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) technology for the qualitative determination of lgG and IgM antibodies of Borrelia burgdorferi in human serum and plasma (K2-EDTA, Li-heparin) samples. This assay is intended for use on samples from patients with signs and symptoms that are consistent with Lyme disease.

Positive or equivocal results with the LIAISON $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Lyme Total Antibody Plus should be confirmed with additional testing by one of the following methodologies:

a). Standard two-tier test (STTT) methodology using an IgG and/or IgM Western blot test for Borrelia burgdorferi.

or -

b). Modified two-tier test (MTTT) methodology using one or more of the following LIAISON $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ assays: LIAISON Lyme IgM and/or LIAISON Lyme IgG

Positive supplemental results either by the STTT or MTTT are supportive evidence of the presence of antibodies and of exposure to Borrelia burgdorferi and may be used along with patient history, symptoms and other laboratory data to support a clinical diagnosis of Lyme disease.

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The LIAISON Lyme IgM assay is an indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) for the qualitative detection of IgM antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in human serum and plasma samples. All assay steps (with the exception of magnetic particle resuspension) and incubations are performed by the Analyzer. The principal components of the test are magnetic particles (solid phase) coated with recombinant Borrelia antigens and a conjugate reagent containing an antihuman IgM mouse monoclonal antibody linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-antibody conjugate). During the first incubation, anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies present in calibrators, samples or controls bind to the solid phase. Unbound material is then removed with a wash cycle. During the second incubation, the antibody conjugate reacts with anti-Borrelia burgdorferi IgM antibodies that have bound to the solid phase. Excess antibody conjugate is then removed with a wash cycle. Subsequently, the starter reagents are added and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is induced. The light signal, and hence the amount of isoluminolantibody conjugate, is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is indicative of the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi IgM antibodies present in calibrators, samples or controls.

# B Principle of Operation:

Chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA)

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: LIAISON XL Analyzer

2. Specimen Identification:

Specimens are identified by barcode and each test parameter is identified via information encoded in the Reagent Integral Radio Frequency Identification transponder (RFID Tag).

Control identification is detected by the bar code label or may be manually programmed into the instrument. Follow the analyzer operator’s manual to start the run. Return controls to the refrigerator immediately after each use.

# 3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Either human serum, SST serum, K2-EDTA plasma and Lithium Heparin plasma may be used in this assay. Blood should be collected aseptically by venipuncture. Serum samples should be allowed to clot. Centrifuge samples and separate serum or plasma from the clot as soon as possible. Samples having particulate matter, turbidity, lipemia, or erythrocyte debris may require clarification by filtration or centrifugation before testing. Grossly hemolyzed or lipemic samples as well as samples containing particulate matter or exhibiting obvious microbial contamination should not be tested. Check for and remove air bubbles before assaying. Samples are stable at room temperature for up to three days. If the assay is performed within 8 days of sample collection, the samples should be kept at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ; otherwise they should be stored frozen ( ${ } _ { - 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ or below). If samples are stored frozen, mix thawed samples well before testing. Samples may be frozen-thawed 5 times. Self-defrosting freezers are not recommended for sample storage.

# 4. Calibration:

The DiaSorin LIAISON Lyme IgM assay generates a continuous response (relative light units, RLU) which is used in sample grading to provide a qualitative (positive, negative, or equivocal) reportable result. The sample grading is based on the use of a calibration curve referenced to an ‘In-house’ anti-Lyme IgG reference standard curve (Master Curve) and is controlled by the use of two calibrators (Calibrator 1 and Calibrator 2) provided in the Reagent Integral. Two point kit calibrators are used to establish specific working curves based on assay master curves stored on the analyzer.

Calibration is required every 8 weeks, or whenever one of the following conditions occurs:

• If Quality Control results are out of the acceptable range • With each new lot of reagents (Reagent Integral or Starter Reagents)

• After each servicing of the LIAISON XL Analyzer

The assay measuring range is 0.01 to 8.0 Index value. Samples that read lower than the measuring curve are reported as $< 0 . 0 1$ Index, and samples that read above the measuring curve are reported as $> 8 . 0$ Index.

# 5. Quality Control:

Quality control is required to be performed once per day of use, or according to the guidelines or requirements of local regulations or accredited organizations. It is recommended that the user refer to CLSI C24-A3 and 42 CFR 493.1256 (c) for guidance on appropriate quality control practices.

LIAISON Lyme IgM controls are intended to monitor for substantial reagent failure. Single replicates of LIAISON controls should be run to monitor the assay performance. If control values lie within the expected ranges provided on the certificate of analysis, the test is valid. If control values lie outside the expected ranges, the test is invalid and patient results cannot be reported. Assay calibration should be performed if a control failure is observed and controls and patient specimens must be repeated.

The performance of other controls should be evaluated for compatibility with this assay before they are used. Appropriate value ranges should be established for all quality control materials used.

The range of concentrations of each control is reported on the certificate of analysis and indicates the limits established by DiaSorin for control values that can be obtained in reliable assay runs.

Class Specificity Study: Dithiothreitol (DTT) was used to specifically inactivate IgM antibodies without affecting $\mathrm { I g G }$ antibodies. Five Borrelia burgdorferi positive specimens containing various levels of $\mathrm { I g G }$ antibodies and known to be IgM positive by Western blot were used for this testing. Samples were divided into two aliquots: one aliquot was spiked with DTT to a final concentration of $1 0 \mathrm { m M }$ and the second aliquot was spiked with the same volume of vehicle control.

Regression of the mean percent difference versus freeze thaw counts does not cross $\pm 1 0 \%$ for any of the sample types tested and thus demonstrate the stability of all claimed specimen types over the sponsor’s stability claim of five freeze-thaw cycles.

Room Temperature Stability

Another stability study was performed to demonstrate analyte stability when stored at room temperature. Six samples containing the same analyte levels as described above were aliquoted and stored at $2 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for the indicated times prior to testing. Samples were tested in duplicate at the following time points: 0, 4, 8, 9, 24, 25, 48, 49, 72, and 73 hours. Data is summarized in the table below.

No significant trend over a period of 73 hours was observed and the mean percent difference versus time does not cross $\pm 1 0 \%$ over the course of the study. These data are sufficient to support the sponsor’s recommended storage claim of three days at room temperature.

An additional specimen stability study was performed to assess stability of samples when stored at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Six samples containing the same analyte levels as described above were aliquoted and stored at $2 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for the indicated times prior to testing. Samples were tested in duplicate at the following time points: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 14 and 15 days. Data is summarized in the table below.

# 7. Assay Cut-Off:

The cut-off for the LIAISON Lyme IgM Assay was determined by evaluating U.S. sourced characterized samples from Lyme disease patients and routine clinical samples sent to the laboratory for Lyme disease serology testing. Based on available clinical and laboratory data and by comparison with other cleared serology assays, the samples were classified as expected positive or negative for B. burgdorferi antibodies and evaluated with the LIAISON Lyme IgM assay. A cut-off index of 1.0 was determined to provide the best balance of sensitivity and specificity. An equivocal zone of 0.90-1.10 was applied to the assay to account for normal measurement imprecision.

# B Comparison Studies:

# 1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

Prospective Cohort Testing: A total of 2,643 human serum specimens were obtained from four approved commercial vendors. The specimens were collected from non-selected subjects sent to the lab for Lyme disease testing in 14 states which represented five distinct geographical regions. Twenty-two (22) samples did not have enough volume to complete all testing and were excluded from the analysis. A total of 2,621 samples were evaluated of which $4 4 . 1 \%$ were male, $5 5 . 7 \%$ were female, and $0 . 2 \%$ did not have a gender reported.

Samples were tested with the LIAISON Lyme IgM assay on the LIAISON XL instrument at three laboratories (two external and one internal at DiaSorin). Results were evaluated for first-tier testing and compared to the predicate device.

Despite a larger number of initially positive specimens on the predicate device, the LIAISON Lyme IgM test yields a larger number of samples positive by second-tier western blot testing. Furthermore, of the 146 specimens positive by the predicate device and negative by the LIAISON Lyme IgM test (Table 11), 124 $( 8 4 . 9 \% )$ were negative by second-tier western blot.

Performance agreement of the Lyme IgM assay when utilized as a first-tier test in a standard two-tiered testing algorithm (STTT) is summarized below and compared to results for the predicate assay.

Cumulatively, these data support equivalence of the LIAISON Lyme IgM test to the predicate device as a first-tier test for Lyme disease.

Performance of the LIAISON Lyme IgM was also evaluated when utilized as a second-tier test as part of a Modified Two-tiered Testing (MTTT) algorithm. Specifically, the 2621 prospective specimens were tested initially with the cleared assay, LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus. Positive or equivocal results on the LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus were subsequently evaluated by the LIAISON Lyme IgM assay with positive or equivocal results considered MTTT positive. Agreement of the MTTT algorithm was also assessed against use of the cleared chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus followed by a cleared western blot test as part of an STTT protocol. These schemes are summarized below.

Retrospective Cohort Testing: A retrospective cohort was also evaluated that consisted of 280 panel members obtained from CDC. The retrospective panel contained 90 specimens from patients known to have Lyme disease, 90 specimens from patients with diseases other than Lyme disease, and 50 specimens each from healthy controls in both endemic and nonendemic regions.

The CDC Lyme panel was tested internally at DiaSorin on the LIAISON Lyme IgM assay and the predicated device (ZEUS ELISA B. burgdorferi IgM assay). No repeat testing of equivocal samples was performed on the ZEUS IgM assay due to limited sample volume. No western blots were performed on any of the positive or equivocal results. Summary of agreement is included in the table below.

Based on the above results, use of the LIAISON Lyme $\mathrm { I g M }$ assay as a second-tier test, successfully detects a greater proportion of early Lyme disease cases. Use of the LIAISON Lyme IgM assay is therefore considered acceptable for use with the LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus assay following the Modified Two-Tiered Testing Methodology.

Analytical Specificity: The LIAISON Lyme IgM assay was used to test 300 samples from apparently healthy individuals in the U.S. This population was $5 7 . 3 \%$ female, $4 2 . 7 \%$ male with a mean age of 50 years. Fifty percent of the samples were collected in a Lyme disease endemic region and $50 \%$ were collected from a Lyme disease non-endemic region.

Thirty-two (32) matched patient sets of serum, SST serum, K2-EDTA plasma and lithium heparin plasma samples were tested to determine if these sample types provide equivalent results. Sample regression analysis was done by Passing & Bablok regression. All sample types met acceptance criteria for use in the LIAISON Lyme IgG assay. A summary of the results are shown in the following table.

Internal and external investigators assessed the device’s performance with 2,621 masked specimens prospectively collected from patients between the ages of 2-103 that were submitted for Borrelia antibody testing. Specimens were acquired from five distinct geographical regions within the U.S. The specimens were randomly distributed among three testing sites, one of which was the manufacturer’s research facility for testing. The device’s performance was also assessed at the manufacturer’s research facility with specimens from an asymptomatic population obtained from both endemic and non-endemic regions. Available subject demographics, quantity of specimens tested and number of specimens which tested positive or equivocal for each population are summarized in Table 18.
