# 1. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

cobas® BKV (Figure 1) is based on fully automated sample preparation (nucleic acid extraction and purification) followed by PCR amplification and detection. The cobas® 6800/8800 Systems consist of the sample supply module, the transfer module, the processing module, and the analytic module. Automated data management is performed by the cobas® $6 8 0 0 / 8 8 0 0$ software which assigns test results for all tests as either target not detected, BKV DNA detected ${ < \mathrm { L L o Q } }$ (lower limit of quantitation), BKV DNA detected $>$ ULoQ (upper limit of quantitation), or a value in the linear range $\mathrm { L L o Q } < \mathbf { x } < \mathrm { U L o Q }$ . Results can be reviewed directly on the system screen, exported, or printed as a report.

Nucleic acid from patient samples and added lambda DNA-QS molecules is simultaneously extracted. In summary, viral nucleic acid is released by addition of proteinase and lysis reagent to the sample. The released nucleic acid binds to the silica surface of the added magnetic glass particles. Unbound substances and impurities, such as denatured protein, cellular debris and potential PCR inhibitors are removed with subsequent wash reagent steps and purified nucleic acid is eluted from the glass particles with elution buffer at elevated temperature.

Selective amplification of target nucleic acid from the sample is achieved by the use of a dual target virus specific approach from highly-conserved regions of the BKV located in the BKV small t-antigen region and the BKV VP2 region. Selective amplification of DNA-QS is achieved by the use of sequence-specific forward and reverse primers which are selected to have no homology with the BKV genome. A thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme is used for amplification. The target and DNA-QS sequences are amplified simultaneously utilizing a universal PCR amplification profile with predefined temperature steps and number of cycles. The master mix includes deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP), instead of deoxythimidine triphosphate (dTTP), which is incorporated into the newly synthesized DNA (amplicon).1-3 Any contaminating amplicon from previous PCR runs is eliminated by the AmpErase enzyme, which is included in the PCR mix, when heated in the first thermal cycling step. However, newly formed amplicons are not eliminated since the AmpErase enzyme is inactivated once exposed to temperatures above $5 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

The cobas® BKV master mix contains two detection probes specific for BKV target sequences and one for the DNA-QS. The probes are labeled with target-specific fluorescent reporter dyes allowing simultaneous detection of BKV target and DNA-QS in two different target channels.4,5The fluorescent signal of the intact probes is suppressed by the quencher dye. During the PCR amplification step, hybridization of the probe to the specific single-stranded DNA templates results in cleavage by the $5 "$ -to-3' nuclease activity of the DNA polymerase resulting in separation of the reporter and quencher dyes and the generation of a fluorescent signal. With each PCR cycle, increasing amounts of cleaved probes are generated and the cumulative signal of the reporter dye is concomitantly increased. Real-time detection and discrimination of PCR products are accomplished by measuring the fluorescence of the released reporter dyes for the viral targets and DNA-QS.

# 4. NON-CLINICAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

# 4.1. Limit of Detection (LoD)

The limit of detection (LoD) of cobas® BKV was determined by analysis of serial dilutions of the WHO International Standard (subgroup Ib) and verified for subgroups Ia, Ic and subtypes II, III and IV. The overall concentration for which $9 5 \%$ hit rate is expected by PROBIT is $1 2 . 2 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ for neat urine.

# 4.1.1. WHO International Standard

The limit of detection of cobas® BKV for the WHO International Standard was determined by analysis of serial dilutions of the $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ WHO BKV International Standard obtained from NIBSC (NIBSC 14/212), in BKV-negative pooled urine stabilized in cobas® PCR Media. Panels of six concentration levels plus a blank were tested over three lots of cobas® BKV reagents, multiple runs, days, operators, and instruments.

The results for pooled urine stabilized in cobas® PCR Media are shown in Table 2 through Table 4. The study demonstrates that with the least sensitive lot, the concentration for which $9 5 \%$ hit rate is expected by PROBIT is $1 2 . 2 ~ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ with a $9 5 \%$ confidence range of $9 . 2 \mathrm { - } 1 8 . 3 ~ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ in neat urine. The lowest concentration with a hit rate $\ge 9 5 \%$ is $1 0 . 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ in neat urine.

# 4.3. Linear range

Linearity of cobas® BKV was evaluated using a dilution series consisting of 10 panel members using a clinical specimen (BKV subgroup Ib) spanning the assay linear range. A high titer lambda DNA stock was used to prepare 12 panel members spanning the entire linear range.

Each panel member was tested in 36 replicates across three lots of cobas® BKV reagents and the results of the study are presented in Figure 2.

cobas® BKV was demonstrated to be linear from $7 . 4 1 \mathrm { E } { + } 0 1 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to $7 . 4 1 \mathrm { E } { + } 0 8 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ and shows an absolute deviation from the better fitting non-linear regression of less or equal than $\pm 0 . 1 \log 1 0$ in pooled urine stabilized in cobas® PCR Media (see Figure 2). Across the linear range, the accuracy of the test was within $\pm 0 . 2 \log 1 0$ .

The lower limit of quantitation (LLoQ) was set to $2 0 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ , to include the mean deviation between the observed vs. the assigned log10 titer (Accuracy) being equal or less than $\pm + / - 0 . 3 \log 1 0$ , based on the upper $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the worst performing lot using clinical specimen and calculated based on a goal for acceptable total analytical error (TAE) of $\leq 1 . 0 \log 1 0 $ , where $\mathrm { T A E } = | \mathbf { b i a s } | + 2$ standard deviations in alignment with the CLSI EP-17A guideline, and TAE $=$ SQUARE ROOT(2) x 2 standard deviations based on the “difference between 2 measurements” approach.

Based on the LLoQ and the determined linear range, as well as the medical value the linear measurement range of the test was set to $2 . 0 \mathrm { E } { + } 0 2 \ \mathrm { I U } / \mathrm { m L L } 2 1$ to- $1 . 0 \mathrm { E + } 0 8 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ . The results of calculation and claimed LLoQ are shown in Table 7.

# 4.4. Linearity for subgroups Ia, Ic and subtypes II, III and IV

The dilution series used in the verification of subtype/subgroup linearity study of cobas® BKV consisted of eight panel members spanning the linear range of the assay. Testing was conducted with three lots of cobas® BKV reagent, 12 replicates per level were tested in urine stabilized in cobas® PCR Media. The results of the study are presented in Table 6.

The linearity within the linear range of cobas® BKV was verified for subgroups Ia, Ic and subtypes II, III and IV. The maximum deviation between the linear regression and the better fitting non-linear regression was equal to or less than $\pm 0 . 2 \log 1 0$ .

# 4.5. Lower Limit of Quantitation

The analysis for LLoQ of cobas® BKV in urine was performed with data obtained from the Linearity study at concentration levels of $1 0 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ , $2 0 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ and $3 0 0 \mathrm { \ : I U / m L }$ . The LLoQ was set at the concentration level of $2 0 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to include the mean deviation between the observed vs. the assigned $\log 1 0$ titer (Accuracy) being equal or less than $\pm 0 . 3 \log 1 0$ , based on the upper $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the worst performing lot using clinical specimen. The LLoQ within the linear range meets the acceptance criterion for the Total Analytical Error $( | \mathrm { B i a s } | + 2 \mathrm { x }$ SD) (TAE). The TAE criterion is $\leq 1 \log 1 0$ .

The results of calculation and claimed LLoQ are shown in Table 7. The LLoQ is $2 0 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$

# 4.6. Precision – within laboratory

Precision of cobas® BKV was determined by analysis of serial dilutions of high titer BKV DNA (subgroup Ib) in BKV-negative pooled urine stabilized in cobas® PCR Media. Five dilution levels were tested in 72 replicates for each level across three lots of cobas® BKV reagents using two instruments and two operators over 12 days. Each sample was carried through the entire cobas® BKV procedure on fully automated cobas® 6800/8800 Systems. Therefore, the precision reported here represents all aspects of the test procedure. The results are shown in Table 8. The results of the variance component estimation are shown in Table 9.

cobas® BKV showed high precision for three lots of reagents tested across a concentration range of $7 . 4 1 \mathrm { E } { + } 0 2 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to $7 . 4 1 \mathrm { E } { + } 0 5 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

# 4.7. Analytical specificity

The analytical specificity of cobas® BKV was evaluated by testing a panel of microorganisms to a concentration between $1 . 0 0 \mathrm { E } { + 0 6 }$ units/mL and $2 . 0 0 \mathrm { E } { + } 0 6$ units/mL (CFU/mL, cells/mL, $\mathrm { C C U / m L }$ , $\mathrm { I F U / m L }$ ) for bacteria and yeast and at $1 . 0 0 \mathrm { E } { + } 0 5$ units/mL (copies/mL, TCID50/mL, $\mathrm { I U / m L }$ , cells $/ \mathrm { m L }$ ) for viruses. Microorganisms were diluted into BKV DNA negative urine as well as urine containing $( 6 0 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ ) BKV DNA. The specific organisms tested are listed in Table 10. Each sample was tested in replicates of three. None of the non-BKV pathogens interfered with test performance at the concentrations tested. Negative results were obtained with cobas® BKV for all microorganism samples without BKV target and positive results were obtained for all of the microorganism samples with BKV target. Furthermore, the mean log10 titer of each of the positive BKV samples containing potentially cross-reacting organisms was within $\pm 0 . 5 \log 1 0$ of the mean $\log 1 0$ titer of the respective positive spike control.

The tested endogenous interferences were shown not to interfere with the test performance of cobas® BKV.

In addition, drug compounds listed in Table 11 were tested in presence and absence of BKV DNA.

All potentially interfering substances, with the exception of talcum powder, have been shown to not interfere with the test performance. Talcum powder at $\leq 0 . 0 5 \%$ showed no interference with cobas® BKV. Negative results were obtained with cobas® BKV for all samples without BKV target and positive results were obtained on all of the samples with BKV target. Furthermore, the mean log10 titer of each of the positive BKV samples containing potentially interfering substances was within $\pm 0 . 5 \log 1 0$ of the mean log10 titer of the respective positive spike control.

# 4.9. Cross contamination

The cross-contamination rate for cobas® BKV was determined by testing 240 replicates of a BKV-negative matrix sample and 225 replicates of a high titer BKV DNA urine sample stabilized in cobas® PCR Media at approximately $1 . 0 0 \mathrm { E } { + } 0 9 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ . In total, five runs were performed with positive and negative samples in a checkerboard configuration.

All 240 replicates of the negative sample were negative, resulting in a cross-contamination rate of $0 . 0 \%$ (upper one-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence interval $1 . 2 4 \%$ ).

# 5. CLINICAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

# 5.1. Reproducibility of cobas® BKV

The reproducibility of cobas® BKV was evaluated across factors (reagent lot, test site, batch and testing days) that could affect reported results in routine clinical testing. The evaluation was conducted at 3 testing sites, using 3 reagent lots, of a positive and a negative sample panel with a total number 270 tests per concentration (not including controls). The panels were made from urine stabilized with cobas® PCR Media that was confirmed negative for BKV DNA using a urine nucleic acid test (NAT) release protocol and spiked with a BKV WHO international standard, or BKV genotype Ia cultured virus DNA. Two operators at each site tested each reagent lot for 5 days. Two runs ( $1 \mathrm { r u n } = 1$ batch; 1 batch $= 1$ panel $^ { + 3 }$ controls) were performed each day and 3 replicates of each panel member were performed for each run. The evaluation results are summarized in Table 12.

cobas® BKV showed acceptable clinical reproducibility at concentrations throughout the linear range. In addition, the system detected $100 \%$ of the $3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ }$ LLoQ samples. The cobas® 6800 and cobas® 8800 Systems share a modular design and they showed equivalency when using cobas® BKV. All of the estimated $9 5 \%$ confidence limits (CLs) for the difference between 2 measurements from the same subject were within $\pm 0 . 2 0 \log _ { 1 0 }$ copies/mL, indicating that the assay can assess changes in BKV DNA levels that are thought to be clinically significant.

The system showed a $9 9 . 2 6 \%$ negative percent agreement with a CI of $9 7 . 3 \%$ to $9 9 . 9 \%$ . Of the 270 valid tests for the negative panel members, two samples $( 0 . 7 4 \% )$ showed a DNA level of ${ < \mathrm { L L o Q } }$ positivity. Further investigation of these results showed that they were not associated with a particular instrument/site or reagent lot. Additional DNA sequencing confirmed the presence of BKV. The identified BKV sequences were different from those of the positive control and the BKV strain used for panel preparation, excluding contamination during panel preparation and suggesting trace viruria in one of the 25 urine specimens of the pooled urine sample that was used for the negative panel preparation.

# 5.2. Clinical Performance of cobas® BKV

The clinical performance of cobas® BKV was further evaluated at three testing sites by measuring BKV DNA levels in clinical urine samples of BKV infected and non-infected patients that were stabilized in cobas® PCR Media, compared with a well-established laboratory developed nucleic acid test (LDT) (comparator BKV LDT).

From all samples tested with cobas® BKV and the comparator BKV test, there were a total of 308 neat urine samples stabilized in cobas® PCR Media from 84 transplant subjects that were valid on both assays and evaluable for the clinical concordance analysis (Table 13).

Paired samples evaluable for clinical concordance analysis were included in this table.

aAssumed independence between all samples.

DNA sequencing performed on representative samples from subjects with results consistently offset by more than $1 \log _ { 1 0 } \mathrm { I U / m L }$ DNA level did not reveal any sequence mismatches for any primer or probe targets for cobas® BKV.

Discordant results were defined as those that are more than one box away from the diagonal (indicated by shading). For Target Not Detected (TND) by LDT Column Agreement the cobas® BKV Target Not Detected and $< \mathrm { L L o Q } ( < 3 . 0 )$ cells were combined. The rationale for adding the adjacent <LLoQ and TND cells for the TND column is that the difference between a TND and <LLoQ is not clinically meaningful and that these are analytically at the lower end of the measuring range, which may be impacted by random error.

Of the 66 BKV DNA-negative samples collected for the estimation of the NPA with the cobas® BKV 61 provided valid results, all 61 samples were negative by cobas® BKV, therefore the NPA was $100 \%$ with the $9 5 \%$ Exact CI of $9 4 . 1 \%$ to $100 \%$ .

Concordance between cobas® BKV and the comparator BKV LDT was also evaluated using different clinical thresholds (Table 14).

From all samples tested with cobas® BKV that were BKV positive with the comparator BKV test, there were a total of 153 neat urine samples stabilized in cobas® PCR Media from 55 transplant subjects evaluable for the correlation analysis at the three testing sites (Figure 3).

Additional bias plot analysis of DNA level differences indicated a systematic difference between both assays that is constant across the overlapping linear range. The $9 5 \%$ CI of the intercept of the fitted line in the bias plots was (0.168 to 0.488), which is within $\pm 0 . 5 \log 1 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ . Furthermore, the mean bias was estimated at $0 . 2 3 1 \log 1 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ and using the equation of the fitted line in the bias plots, the systematic difference between both assays was -0.248 $\mathrm { l o g 1 0 I U / m L }$ and $0 . 1 8 8 \log 1 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ for samples with DNA levels at 4 and $7 \log 1 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ , respectively.

# 6. CONCLUSIONS

The results of non-clinical analytical and clinical performance studies demonstrate that cobas® BKV for use on the cobas® 6800/8800 Systems is as safe, as effective, and performs as well as the predicate device .
