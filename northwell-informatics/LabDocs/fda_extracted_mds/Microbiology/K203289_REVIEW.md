# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi VlsE-OspC IgG/IgM ELISA Test Kit is an Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the qualitative detection of IgG and IgM antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in human serum.

During the test procedure, antibodies to B. burgdorferi (sensu stricto) if present in the human serum sample will bind to the antigens coated onto the wells forming antigen-antibody complexes. Excess antibodies are removed by washing. A conjugate of goat anti-human $\mathrm { I g G / I g M }$ antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase is then added, which binds to the antigen-antibody complexes. Excess conjugate is removed by washing. This is followed by the addition of a chromogenic substrate, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). If specific antibodies to the antigen are present in the patients’ serum, a blue color will develop. The enzymatic reaction is then stopped with a stopping solution causing the contents of the well to turn yellow. The wells are read photometrically with a microplate reader at $4 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . OD values from controls or patient samples are converted to units by comparing to a cutoff value established using calibrators included with the kit. A result $< 9 . 0$ units is negative and a result ${ \mathrm { > } } 1 1 . 0$ units is positive. Samples with results of 9.0-11.0 units are considered equivocal.

The antigens used in the assay is a combination of recombinant VlsE and OspC from $B$ . burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31. The recombinants are produced in E. coli and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) via Polyhistidine-tag. The purity of each antigen is assayed by SDS-PAGE followed by Colloidal-Coomassie staining and western blotting.

The kit includes $1 2 \times 8$ well Antigen Coated strips, Conjugate, Substrate, Stop Solution, Wash Buffer, Diluent, Negative Control, Positive Control, and a Calibrator. The controls are provided to determine if the assay is functioning properly and to determine the antibody level. The reagents are sufficient for 96 determinations.

Calculation of Units and Results Interpretation

The OD of the blank value should be subtracted from all other OD values. The cutoff is determined by multiplying the Calibrator OD (or mean OD) by the Correction Factor value printed on the Calibrator vial label and on the Quality Control Certificate.

Cutoff $= \mathrm { O D }$ Calibrator x Correction Factor (C.F.) Units $: =$ (OD Controls or Samples / Cutoff) x 10 \*Units are qualitative. They are values defined by the manufacturer.

The results are interpreted as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Units</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Results</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Interpretation</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&lt;9.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Negative</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>No detectable antibody.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

Sample Stability Study

Fresh samples (a Positive, Low Positive, High Negative and Negative sample) were initially tested on the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi VlsE-OspC IgG/IgM ELISA Test (day 0) then subsequently stored at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for eight days. No significant changes in assay signal was observed. The data support a stability claim of seven days when stored at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Freeze-thaw Study

A similar study was performed on samples stored frozen (including a positive, low positive, high negative, and negative sample). Samples were tested initially at day 0 and subsequently frozen at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . The samples were then thawed, tested and frozen. This process was repeated for a total of four freeze-thaw cycles. No significant changes were observed over the course of the study supporting a freeze-thaw stability claim of three freeze-thaw cycles.

6. Detection Limit: Not Applicable.

# 7. Assay Cut-Off:

The cutoff was determined by testing a total of 238 normal sera which consisted of 101 sera from an endemic region of Lyme disease and 95 sera from a non-endemic region of Lyme disease. The mean plus three standard deviations was used to determine the assay cutoff. A known positive sample was then diluted to produce a ready to use cutoff control. An additional 197 samples consisting of 125 samples from different phases of Lyme disease (79 samples from Dr. Steere and 46 samples from the CDC), and 72 negative Lyme disease samples (from CDC) but do have other diseases that may cause serologic cross-reactivity, were tested. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the performance of the assay and confirm that the chosen cutoff provided the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity.

# Method Comparison MTTT Algorithm – IgG/IgM

Additional analyses were performed to determine the performance of the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi VlsE-OspC IgG/IgM ELISA test as a first-tier or secondtier assay in the modified two-tier testing (MTTT) methodology.

Four hundred eighty-one (481) serum samples were tested on both the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi VlsE-OspC IgG/IgM ELISA Test and on the predicate $B$ . burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA Test. A total of 63 positive and equivocal samples were obtained with the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi VlsE-OspC IgG/IgM ELISA. A total of 54 positive and equivocal samples were obtained with the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA. A total of 68 positive and equivocal samples were obtained with both the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi VlsEOspC $\mathrm { I g G / I g M }$ ELISA and the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi $\mathrm { I g G / I g M }$ ELISA.. In the STTT protocol the samples that were positive or equivocal $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n = 6 8 } )$ ) were tested with B. burgdorferi IgG and IgM blot tests. In the MTTT protocol the samples $\scriptstyle \left( \ n = 6 8 \right)$ ) were tested on a second ELISA, the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi $\mathrm { I g G / I g M }$ ELISA Test. In the second-tier ELISA test, positive and equivocal results were considered positive. These two test methodologies are depicted in the figures below.

# Method Comparison – MTTT Methodology (IgM)

The Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi VlsE-OspC IgG/IgM ELISA Test was utilized as the first-tier assay in a MTTT protocol. All positive and equivocal results were then tested on the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgM ELISA Test as the second-tier testing. The results were compared to the standard two-tier testing (STTT) using the predicate $B$ . burgdorferi $\mathrm { I g G / I g M }$ ELISA followed by testing all positive and equivocal results on the predicate $B .$ . burgdorferi IgM blot test.

Comparison studies were conducted at three sites (one internal and two external reference laboratories) using prospective samples submitted for Lyme serology testing. Four hundred eighty-one (481) serum samples were tested on both the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi VlsE-OspC IgG/IgM ELISA Test and on the predicate B. burgdorferi $\mathrm { I g G / I g M }$ ELISA Test. A total of 63 positive and equivocal samples were obtained with the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi VlsE-OspC IgG/IgM ELISA. A total of 54 positive and equivocal samples were obtained with the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA. A total of 68 positive and equivocal samples were obtained with both assays. In the STTT protocol the samples that were positive or equivocal $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n = 6 8 } )$ were tested with a B. burgdorferi IgM blot test. In the MTTT protocol the samples $( \mathrm { n } { = } 6 8 )$ ) were tested on a second ELISA, the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgM ELISA Test. In the second-tier ELISA test, positive and equivocal results were considered positive. These test methodologies are summarized in Figure 5 and Figure 6 below.
