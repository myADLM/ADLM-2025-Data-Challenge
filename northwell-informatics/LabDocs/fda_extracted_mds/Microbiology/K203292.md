Common Name: Lyme ELISA Test

Regulation Section: (21 CFR 866.3830) Treponema pallidum treponemal test reagents.

Classification: Class II

Product Code: LSR; Reagent, Borrelia Serological Reagent

Note: This clearance is for a modified use (Modified Two-tier Testing or MTTT use) for the previously cleared IVD test, the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA Test Kit (K180264). The information and study data for the modified use is presented under the heading of “MTTT Comparison” below. With the exception of the intended use, all other information and data remain the same.

3) Legally Marketed Device to Which the Submitter Claims Equivalence:

a. STTT - Trinity Biotech Captia™ Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA Test Kit (K033070). b. MTTT - Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG Blot Test Kit (K113847) and the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgM Blot Test Kit (K113846).

# 4) Description of the Device:

The kit includes $1 2 \times 8$ well Antigen Coated strips, Conjugate, Substrate, Stop Solution, Wash Buffer, Diluent, Negative Control, Positive Control, and Cutoff Control. The controls are provided to determine if the assay is functioning properly and to determine the antibody level. The reagents are sufficient for 96 determinations.

During the test procedure, antibodies to $B .$ . burgdorferi (sensu stricto) if present in the human serum sample will bind to the antigens coated onto the wells forming antigen-antibody complexes. Excess antibodies are removed by washing. A conjugate of goat anti-human $\mathrm { I g G / I g M }$ antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase are then added, which binds to the antigen-antibody complexes. Excess conjugate is removed by washing. This is followed by the addition of a chromogenic substrate, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). If specific antibodies to the antigen are present in the patients’ serum, a blue color will develop. The enzymatic reaction is then stopped with a stopping solution causing the contents of the well to turn yellow. The wells are read photometrically with a microplate reader at $4 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .

The antigens used in the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA Test kit is a combination of $B$ . burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31 lysate, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain 2591 lysate, and a recombinant VlsE from $B _ { \cdot }$ . burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31. The lysates use spirochetes growing in BSK-H complete medium until mid-exponential phase. The recombinant VlsE protein is produced in $E .$ . coli SURE2 cells and purified by affinity chromatography. The purity of each antigen is assayed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining and/or Western blotting.

# 5) Intended Use of the Device:

The Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi $\mathrm { I g G / I g M }$ ELISA Test Kit is intended as a qualitative test for the detection of IgG and $\mathrm { I g M }$ antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto in human serum from symptomatic patients or people suspected of infection. When used as the first-tier screening test, positive and equivocal results must be confirmed through additional testing by one of the following methods:

Standard two-tier test methodology (STTT) using an IgG and/or IgM blot testing following current interpretation guidelines, OR  Modified two-tier test methodology (MTTT) using the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi VlsE-OspC IgG/IgM ELISA Test.

The assay can also be used as a second-tier confirmation test using the MTTT methodology when used with the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi VlsE-OspC IgG/IgM ELISA Test as the first-tier screening test.

Positive test results by either the STTT or MTTT methodology are supportive evidence for the presence of antibodies and exposure to Borrelia burgdorferi, the cause of Lyme disease. A diagnosis of Lyme disease should be made based on the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies, history, symptoms, and other laboratory findings.

# Determination of the Assay Cutoff

The cutoff was determined by testing a total of 200 normal sera which consisted of 100 sera from an endemic region of Lyme disease and 100 sera from a non-endemic region of Lyme disease. The mean plus two standard deviations was used to determine the assay cutoff. A known positive sample was then diluted to produce a ready to use cutoff control. After the cutoff was determined 125 characterized Lyme disease samples were tested. An ROC analysis was then generated with the 325 samples (200 normal and 125 characterized samples) to verify the chosen cutoff. The analysis confirmed that the assay cutoff provided an optimal level of sensitivity and specificity.

# Precision

To determine the precision of the Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA Test, a within-lab precision study was conducted. A precision panel consisting of a negative sample, a high negative sample, a low positive sample, and a moderate positive sample, along with the kit controls, was tested in-house. The sample panel was masked and randomized. Each of the panel members was tested in duplicate, twice per day, for 12 days. The sample panel was masked and randomized.

# Method Comparison MTTT – IgG/IgM

The following studies were conducted to determine the performance of the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi $\mathrm { I g G / I g M }$ ELISA Test as a first-tier or second-tier assay in the modified two-tier testing (MTTT) methodology.

Gold Standard Diagnostics MTTT-IgG/IgM ELISA Method Comparison: The Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA Test was utilized in a MTTT (2- ELISA) protocol with the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi VlsE-OspC IgG/IgM ELISA Test. The MTTT (2-ELISA) results were compared to the standard two-tier testing (STTT) using the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA followed by testing all positive and equivocal results on the predicate Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG blot test and Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgM blot test.

# Prospective Study

Comparison studies were conducted at three sites (one internal and two external reference laboratories) using prospective samples submitted for Lyme serology testing. Four hundred eighty-one (481) serum samples were tested on the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA Test. A total of 54 positive and equivocal samples were obtained.

In the STTT protocol the samples that were positive or equivocal $( \mathrm { n } { = } 5 4 )$ ) were tested with $B$ . burgdorferi IgG and IgM blot tests. In the MTTT protocol the samples $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 5 4 )$ were tested on a second ELISA, the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi VlsE-OspC $\mathrm { I g G / I g M }$ ELISA Test. In the second-tier ELISA test, positive and equivocal results were considered positive.

The results of the second-tier test of the STTT when compared to the second-tier test of the MTTT, including only the samples that were positive in the first tier, are summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=2></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=3>Predicate IgG &amp; IgMImmunoblots</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Positive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Negative</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=3 colspan=1>Gold Standard DiagnosticsBorrelia burgdorferi VlsE-OspC IgG/IgM ELISA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Positive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>36</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>13</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>49</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Negative</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>36</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>18</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>54</td></tr></table>
