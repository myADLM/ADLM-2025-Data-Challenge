# D Special Instrument Requirements:

The CMV assay is to be used with manual, semi-automated methods as well as with NEO Iris $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ and Galileo $\mathrm { N E O @ }$ instruments.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

Capture-CMV is a solid phase red cell adherence antibody detection system based on procedures of Plapp et al (1984;82:719).

The assay consists of Capture-CMV Microtitration Wells coated with glycine-extracted and purified CMV antigen obtained from cytomegalovirus strain AD 169 grown in human foreskin (HF) fibroblast cells.

Sold separately are the adjunct reagents to capture test wells and controls.

Capture-CMV Indicator Red Cells: a suspension of human red blood cells coated with rabbit anti-human IgG plus goat anti-human IgM molecules;   
Capture LISS: a low ionic strength solution containing glycine, bromocresol purple dye and sodium azide   
Capture-CMV Positive Control Serum (weak): Human serum containing IgG antibodies to CMV viral proteins   
Capture-CMV Negative Control Serum: Human serum containing no antibodies to CMV

The CMV assay is to be used with manual, semi-automated methods as well as with NEO Iris® and Galileo $\mathrm { N E O } ^ { \mathfrak { \left( B \right) } }$ instruments.

# B Principle of Operation:

This procedure is a modification of the mixed agglutination tests for antigen and antibody detection of Coombs et al. (1956;2:84) and Hogman (1959;4:12).

The assay procedure is a two-step solid phase red cell adherence test carried out in microtitration wells coated with inactivated CMV virus. The CMV antigen utilized in this test is obtained from the cytomegalovirus strain AD 169 grown in human foreskin (HF) fibroblast cells. The inactivated virus is coated onto microtitration wells. The wells are dried and supplied to users along with necessary reagents and controls. Serum or plasma samples are added to the viralcoated wells and incubated for five minutes during which antibodies specific for CMV proteins bind to immobilized viral proteins. Unbound immunoglobulins are washed from the wells and replaced with a suspension of anti-IgG and anti-IgM-coated indicator red cells. Centrifugation brings the indicator red cells in contact with antibodies bound to the immobilized viral proteins. In the case of a positive test, the migration of the indicator cells to the bottom of the well is impeded as the anti-IgG and anti-IgM bridges are formed between the indicator red cells and the viralbound antibodies. As a consequence, the indicator red cells adhere over the surface of the test well. In contrast, in the absence of viral antigen-antibody interactions (i.e. a negative test) the indicator red cells are not impeded during their migration, and pellet to the bottom of the well as a packed, well-defined cell button.

The image of cells adhered in the well is captured and analyzed by an instrument. The plate reader uses IDS CMOS camera to capture an image of the microplate from underneath. The software calculates a reaction value for each well based on a multi feature image analysis then assigns a result and interpretation to the wells based on predefined criteria associated with the calculated reaction value.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: The NEO Iris® and Galileo $\mathrm { N E O } ^ { \mathfrak { \left( B \right) } }$ instruments

2. Specimen Identification: The Gaileo NEO supports the use of the following barcode symbologies: Codabar; Code 128; ISBT 128 (Concatenated barcodes are not supported) and Code 39.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

A blood specimen is drawn using an acceptable phlebotomy technique. Serum or plasma (EDTA, CPD, CP2D, CPDA-1, ACD) may be used in this assay. Testing should be performed as soon as possible to minimize the chance that falsely positive or falsely negative reactions will occur due to improper storage or contamination of the specimen. Should delays in testing occur, serum or EDTA, CPD, and ACD anticoagulated whole blood specimens should be stored at $1 { - } 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to one week. Specimens collected in CP2D and CPDA-1 anticoagulants and stored as whole blood specimens at $1 { - } 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ may be tested up to 42 days post-collection. Testing of CPDA-1 and ACD anticoagulated specimens stored at $1 8 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for five days is acceptable. Alternatively, serum or plasma can be separated from red cells and stored frozen at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in a nondefrosting freezer refrigerator. Samples should not be repeatedly frozen and thawed.

The Galileo NEO is programmed to move microplates, liquid reagent fluids, and blood sample fluids to different bays and processing areas for a given assay in the correct sequence. Such bays and areas include incubator bays, the microplate washing station, the centrifuge, and the reader.

# 4. Calibration:

The instrument is calibrated at the site of manufacture using a reader verification plate (RVP). The plate is provided with the instrument to the end user, for calibration verification. Reader verification plate is stored in a protective case and should be replaced upon expiration that is three years from the calibration date which is the same as the release date provided on the Release Statement.

# 5. Quality Control:

Capture-CMV Positive Control Serum   
Capture-CMV Negative Control Serum   
The reactivity of the Capture- $\mathrm { C M V } @$ assay is evaluated at each run by inclusion of the   
negative and weak positive controls. If, in any test run, the Positive Control Serum (Weak)   
does not produce positive results and/or the Negative Control Serum does not produce   
negative results, the NEO Iris $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ /Galileo NEO $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ will invalidate the test run and all the tests

performed in the run must be repeated. Continued failure of the control sera to perform properly may indicate that either one or more of the test reagents has deteriorated.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility:

The Galileo NEO $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ instrument is identical to the NEO Iris $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ instrument, except branding and exterior colors. Thus, the CMV assay performance on Galileo $\mathrm { N E O @ }$ is identical to the CMV assay performance on NEO Iris $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ . Consequently, the reproducibility data collected for the CMV assay on the NEO Iris $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ (K183571) were re-used in the current application and are summarized below.

Reproducibility of Capture- $\mathrm { . C M V } @$ assay on NEO $\operatorname { I r i s } \textcircled { \mathrm { R } }$ was determined at three test sites: two external sites and one internally at Immucor. A panel of ten coded samples was used: five CMV antibody positive and five CMV antibody negative. The samples were tested by two operators, in duplicate, two runs per day for five nonconsecutive days. A variance component analysis was performed based on the original raw scores. Reproducibility was assessed as concordance between the CMV assay result and the status of the sample. The summary of reproducibility results by site are presented in Table 2 below.

Assay limitations:

Positive test results in symptomatic patients require careful interpretation since falsepositive reactions or heterotypic IgM responses may occur with sera from patients with heterophile-positive mononucleosis or varicella zoster infection (see also the Product Insert)   
Care should be taken in interpreting test results of neonatal samples. A positive test usually indicates the presence of antibodies passively transferred from mother to fetus. A negative test may be helpful in excluding possible infection, but a diagnosis of active CMV infection may require viral culture.

4. Assay Reportable Range: Not applicable; this is a qualitative assay

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods): There were no changes to Capture-CMV $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ assay reagents and controls since it has been cleared under K183571.

6. Detection Limit: Not applicable; this is a qualitative assay with the output: reactive/nonreactive

# 7. Assay Cut-Off:

The cutoff for the CMV assay is a well score 45.5. The well score is based on a multi-feature image analysis performed by the camera and the related software.

# 8. Accuracy (Instrument):

The system verification activities for NEO Iris $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ included all testing performed related to the CMV assay as appropriate including assay performance for establishing equivalency. All documents generated to support the development, and operations of the system adhere to standard procedures. Testing was executed in accordance with the execution and test procedure instructions.

Additional detailed information about the system verification can be found under the NEO Iris premarket notification BK180243. The results of the verification have been found acceptable to confirm safety and performance.

# 9. Carry-Over:

There were no changes to Capture-CMV $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ assay reagents and controls since it has been cleared under K183571

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

No new clinical studies were performed as the NEO Iris $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ and the upgraded Galileo NEO $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ (software version 3.0.1) instruments are functionally identical. The data in the following tables were submitted for clearance of the NEO $\operatorname { I r i s } @$ in K183571 and are included in the current submission to support clearance of the Capture- $\mathrm { C M V } @$ assay when used with the upgraded Galileo $\mathrm { N E O @ }$ (software version 3.0.1). In these studies, the performance of the Capture- $\mathrm { C M V } @$ on NEO $\operatorname { I r i s } @$ was compared with the performance of the assay on the original Galileo $\mathrm { N E O @ }$ instrument (cleared in BK100033). For more information refer to K183571: Capture- $\mathrm { C M V } @$ (K183571 Decision Summary and 510(k) Summary).

The following section provides a summary of the previous study and results. Method comparison studies were performed at four clinical sites, three external sites and internally at Immucor, Inc. for donor specimens and at two external sites and internally at Immucor, Inc. for patient specimens. Specimens were tested on NEO Iris $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ and Galileo $\mathrm { N E O @ }$ . Test results were evaluated for agreement between analyzers. Specimens with discordant results were further tested with a commercially available particle agglutination assay for total antibody (IgG and IgM) to CMV.
