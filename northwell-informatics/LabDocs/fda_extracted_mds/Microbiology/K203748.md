# I. Device Description:

SeptiCyte RAPID is an in vitro diagnostic test for simultaneous amplification and detection of two RNA transcripts (PLA2G7 and PLAC8) using total RNA extracted from human blood. The test has been designed, manufactured, and validated for use on the Biocartis Idylla real-time PCR system. The SeptiCyte RAPID test is performed with an Idylla Cartridge, a single-use, disposable, multi-chambered fluidic cartridge that runs on the Biocartis Idylla System. In an automated fashion, all reaction steps take place within the cartridge, including sample extraction/purification, RT-qPCR for the detection and relative quantification of the two human mRNA targets PLAC8, PLA2G7. Test results (measured Cq values and calculated SeptiScore) are available in about 65 minutes.

The specimen used for the SeptiCyte RAPID is a sample of whole blood collected in a PAXgene blood RNA tube (FDA 510k number K042613). The cartridge contains all of the necessary reagents to perform RNA isolation from the sample.

SeptiCyte RAPID uses quantitative, real-time determination of the amount of each transcript in the sample based on the detection of fluorescence by the Biocartis Idylla qPCR instrument function. The cartridge includes the reagents for reverse transcription and PCR. Transcripts PLAC8 and PLA2G7 are amplified and quantified. These values are combined to produce the SeptiScore, which is interpreted and categorized into four discrete bands, which are associated with a sequentially higher likelihood of sepsis.

# L. Test Principle:

The SeptiCyte RAPID test employs a coupled reverse transcription - quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) system to measure the expression levels (Cq values) of the host response genes PLA2G7 and PLAC8 isolated from whole blood. Amplicons generated by the RT-qPCR process are detected and quantitated by fluorescent dyes, upon exonucleolytic release of the dyes from oligonucleotide probes that specifically bind to the amplicons. The test is configured to run on the Biocartis Idylla System. The assay-specific software uses the measured PLA2G7 and PLAC8 Cq values to generate a SeptiScore, which falls into four discrete bands associated with a sequentially higher likelihood of sepsis.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

# 1. Analytical Performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility

Repeatability and intermediate precision were measured according to CLSI EP5-A3, using replicate PAXgene blood samples prepared from low, medium and high SeptiScore pools of PAXgene blood. Standard deviations were calculated for different subsets of data across operators, days, and instruments. Two sub-studies were performed:

Sub-Study #1 - The primary purpose of this sub-study was to evaluate repeatability (within-run precision). The study was performed using the Low sample pool, and was performed over three days, by two operators running three replicates per day, with all runs on a single instrument. Sub-study #1 was performed with a single lot of cartridges.

Sub-Study #2 – The purpose of this sub-study was to evaluate intermediate precision. Sub-study #2 was performed with one cartridge lot, over a total span of 12 days, using three instruments and two operators. Each operator’s runs were conducted over 4 non-sequential days within the 12-day study window. Each combination of day, operator and instrument was tested with two replicates. At each level of sub-study #2, aggregate means and standard deviations were calculated. These were then further summarized by taking the average of the aggregates as presented in the summary table.

Table 7-1 presents a summary of results for the repeatability and intermediate precision studies for SeptiScore. Low CVs were also observed for the individual PLA2G7 and PLAC8 Cq’s.

# b. Lot-to-Lot reproducibility

Lot-to-lot reproducibility was performed with the three sample types (Low, Medium, and High pools, as described in the previous study) using three cartridge lots, over 3 non-consecutive days, using two instruments and one operator. Each combination of lot, day, and instrument was tested with two replicates.

The samples used in the study were prepared from banked samples in PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes. The banked samples were pooled to prepare a High Pool, Medium Pool, and Low Pool, with high, medium, and low SeptiScore results, respectively. Table 7-2 summarizes the results for the lot-to-lot reproducibility study for SeptiScore. Low CVs were also observed for the individual PLA2G7 and PLAC8 Cq’s.

# c. Linearity/assay reportable range

A specimen panel to test the linearity of quantitation of the two mRNA targets (PLA2G7, PLAC8) was constructed by spiking varying amounts of white blood cells (WBC) into a matrix consisting of platelet-reduced plasma. A broad range of WBC input amounts $2 5 \ \mathsf { c e l l s } / \mu \updownarrow$ to $5 0 , 0 0 0 ~ { \tt c e l l s } / { \mu \mathrm { L } } )$ was tested. An inverse log-linear response (Pearson’s $r ^ { 2 } > 0 . 9 9 \AA$ ) was observed for the Cq of the individual SeptiCyte RAPID assay targets (PLA2G7 and PLAC8) when calculated across the entire input WBC concentration range. At the level of the individual analytes (PLA2G7, PLAC8), there appears to be a small Hook Effect (non-linearity) at the highest input concentrations (25,000 cells/µL and above). However, the SeptiScore, which is calculated based on relative expression of the individual analytes, compensates for the Hook Effect at the high input concentrations.

d. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (controls, calibrators, or methods)

# Controls:

A sample processing control is present in each cartridge. This consists of a predefined quantity of dried bacteriophage MS2 particles, which become mixed with the sample after sample addition but before further processing. The sample processing control is taken through the entire sample processing path, ultimately generating a PCR curve and Cq value, thereby serving as a positive control for both the extraction process and for the correct general functioning of the RT-qPCR enzymology.

# Real-Time Stability:

Three manufactured lots of SeptiCyte RAPID cartridges were found to be stable for a minimum of 12 months when stored between ${ } ^ { 2 ^ { \circ } \complement }$ and $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ in their packaging as delivered (i.e., in their sealed pouches) .

# In-Use Stability:

The results of the in-use stability study confirm that the SeptiCyte RAPID cartridge exhibits stability under two tested conditions:

When unwrapped for up to 3 days before loading the sample and running on the Idylla instrument, and

• When held for up to 9 hours after receiving a sample, before running on the Idylla instrument.

These tests were conducted at the upper end of the range of expected laboratory conditions $3 0 \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $7 5 \pm 5 \%$ relative humidity).

# Shipping Stability:

The SeptiCyte RAPID test is packaged in secondary packaging that is consistent with other tests manufactured for the Idylla platform. The shipping stability study consisted of thermal stress and shock/vibration components. Cartridges subjected to thermal stress or shock vibration had similar SeptiScore values when compared to their respective reference condition (cartridges tested during QC release). All Cq and SeptiScore values were valid and within ±1 $0 \%$ of their respective reference values obtained at the time of QC release.

# e. Detection limit

To determine the LoD and LoQ, platelet-reduced plasma was spiked with serial dilutions of white blood cells (WBCs) and 20 replicates of each level of WBC tested with the SeptiCyte RAPID Test. The lowest level at which 19/20 replicates generated a SeptiScore is reported as the LoD. The LoQ is the lowest level of WBC for which 19/20 replicates generate a SeptiScore with a standard deviation of 1.0 Score units or less. The LoD and LoQ were both determined to be 25 WBC/uL blood. Additionally, a platelet-reduced plasma sample with no spiked WBC (matrix only) was included and tested with 10 replicates to demonstrate that a SeptiScore would not be generated for any of the matrix replicates.

# f. Analytical specificity

# Interfering Substances

Based on the CLSI Guidance EP07-A2, “Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry” SeptiCyte RAPID was evaluated in the presence of interfering substances. Each substance was added to a blood sample in a PAXgene Blood RNA tube. No interference was found for any of the substances in Table 7-3 at the concentration listed.

# Lack of Reactivity Towards Blanks or Genomic DNA

This analytical specificity study was designed to confirm that the SeptiCyte RAPID test does not generate a valid signal against blank samples or in the presence of genomic DNA (gDNA).

Blank samples were prepared by adding a volume of nuclease-free phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) to PAXgene stabilizer at the same volume ratio of specimen to RNA stabilizer expected during the standard sample collection process for PAXgene Blood RNA tubes. Twenty aliquots $( 0 . 9 ~ \mathrm { m L } )$ of this blank preparation were then tested with individual SeptiCyte RAPID cartridges. In addition to the blank samples, 10 cartridges were run empty, with no sample added to the lysis chamber prior to running on the Biocartis Idylla system. For absence of reactivity towards gDNA, testing was conducted on 10 replicates of each of two commercially procured total human gDNA samples. Each lot was tested at 500 ng and 1000 ng gDNA input per reaction.

The results of the study conclude that (1) the SeptiCyte RAPID test does not exhibit reactivity toward blank samples and (2) the SeptiCyte RAPID test does not exhibit reactivity toward human genomic DNA, at input quantities of either 500 ng or 1000 ng per reaction.

# g. Carryover

To evaluate the potential for carryover events, a series of 21 cartridges were tested with alternating blank samples, low SeptiScore positive samples, and high SeptiScore positive samples. The results of the study showed that all blank samples failed to generate a valid SeptiScore. All of the low SeptiScore samples generated a result in Band 1, and all of the high SeptiScore samples generated a result in Band 4. The results from the carryover study confirm that no carryover contamination events occur during the processing of individual SeptiCyte RAPID test cartridges.

# h. PAXgene Blood RNA Tube Stability

Two matched PAXgene Blood RNA samples were collected from each of 15 healthy donors. The first sample was processed in real time, by removing two $0 . 9 \mathsf { m L }$ aliquots for SeptiCyte RAPID analysis at the following times after phlebotomy: immediately (i.e., less than 5 min) and after 120 minutes. During this period of time, both tubes were held at room temperature $( 1 8 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ to approximate the sample handling conditions in a near-patient setting (e.g., STAT laboratory). The second PAXgene Blood RNA sample was frozen and stored at $\textless - 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for one month before being thawed, processed, and analyzed by SeptiCyte RAPID, to determine if storage at $\textless - 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , combined with one freeze/thaw cycle, has any effect on the resultant Cq and SeptiScore. The study demonstrated that matched healthy donor PAXgene blood samples did not differ significantly, when a 2-hour sample incubation step was either included or omitted. Additionally, SeptiScore values for matched healthy donor PAXgene blood samples were comparable, when samples were processed fresh (no incubation after blood draw), versus after being frozen and thawed once.

# a. Prospective and Retrospective Studies

The validation and 510(k) clearance of SeptiCyte RAPID was based on samples and clinical data collected from the following observational trials, which recruited critically ill subjects suspected of sepsis:

Netherlands-based Molecular diagnosis And Risk Stratification of sepsis (MARS)   
clinical trial (NCT01905033) – retrospective study   
USA-based Validation of septic gene Expression Using SeptiCyte (VENUS)   
clinical trial (NCT02127502) – retrospective study   
USA-based NEar PatienT MolecUlar TestiNg in Sepsis (NEPTUNE) clinical trial–   
prospective study

The overall clinical accuracy of the SeptiCyte RAPID test was established by combining data from the retrospective $N = 3 5 6$ , frozen specimens) and prospective $( \mathsf { N } = 3 0$ , fresh specimens) clinical studies for a combined dataset of size $N = 3 8 6$ .The prospective study was terminated early due to enrollment restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In both retrospective and prospective studies, the clinical status of each subject (SIRS, sepsis or indeterminate) was determined by clinical case review or retrospective physician diagnosis (RPD) conducted by an external three-member expert panel not involved in the care of the patients. Three different methods of RPD were used in analysis, as briefly described below:

Consensus: Two or three RPD panelists agree that patient is either sepsis or SIRS.   
Indeterminates are excluded.

Unanimous: All three RPD panelists, as well as the consensus discharge evaluation of the site investigators, agree that patient is either sepsis or SIRS. (A unanimous call of indeterminate is also theoretically possible).

Forced: Applies to patients that are initially called “indeterminate” by the RPD panelists. The RPD panelists are then forced to make a consensus or unanimous call of sepsis or SIRS.

The combined retrospective and prospective studies had the following acceptance criteria for the primary endpoint:

1) A monotonic increase in probability of sepsis across the four SeptiScore interpretation bands;

2) Non-overlapping $80 \%$ confidence intervals for the probability of sepsis between non-adjacent SeptiScore interpretation bands (i.e., between bands 1 and 3; and between bands 2 and 4).

The clinical data and primary endpoint analysis are summarized in Figure 7-1 and Table 7-4:

Figure 7-1: Analysis of clinical performance data. Results are presented for (A) Forced, (B) Consensus, and (C) Unanimous RPD methods. The percentage (prevalence) of sepsis is indicated for each Band with error bars representing $80 \%$ confidence intervals. The number (N) of sepsis and SIRS in each Band is indicated to the right of the point estimate (NSepsis:NSIRS) as determined by each RPD method.

# 4. Clinical interpretation

SeptiCyte RAPID generates a score (SeptiScore) that falls within one of four discrete Interpretation Bands based on the increasing likelihood of infectionpositive systemic inflammation.

SeptiScore cut-off values (i.e., the interpretation band thresholds) were established prior to the clinical trial. The following SeptiScore Interpretation tables are the results from validation clinical trials using the Forced Diagnosis (Table 7-5), Consensus Diagnosis (Table 7-6), or Unanimous RPD Diagnosis (Table 7-7).

\*Distribution observed from clinical trial

# 5. Expected values/Reference range:

Test samples were collected from a total of 30 (29 for Hispanic donors) individual adult donors $_ { ( \ge 2 0 }$ years of age) for each race/ethnicity (White, African American, Asian, Hispanic). The donor cohort consisted of an equal number of males (15) and females (15). SeptiCyte RAPID is not intended for use in patients not suspected of sepsis. Healthy individuals may generate scores above Band 1.
