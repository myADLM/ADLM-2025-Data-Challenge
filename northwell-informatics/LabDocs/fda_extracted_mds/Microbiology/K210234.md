# 1. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The cobas® Influenza A/B & RSV Nucleic Acid Test for use on the cobas® Liat® System (cobas® Influenza A/B & RSV) is an automated in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV RNA in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens. The sample-to-result time is ${ \sim } 2 0$ minutes.

The assay is performed on the cobas® Liat® Analyzer which automates and integrates sample purification, nucleic acid amplification, and detection of the target sequence in biological samples using real-time RT-PCR assays. The assay targets a well-conserved region of the matrix gene of Influenza A (Inf A target), the non-structure protein gene of Influenza B (Inf B target), and the matrix gene of RSV (RSV target). An Internal Process Control (IPC) is also included. The IPC is present to control for adequate processing of the target virus through all steps of the assay process and to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the RT-PCR reactions.

The cobas® Liat® System consists of an instrument and preloaded software for running tests and viewing the results. The system requires the use of a single-use disposable cobas® Influenza A/B & RSV assay tube that holds the nucleic acid purification and RT-PCR reagents, and hosts the sample preparation and RT-PCR processes.

The detection module monitors the reaction in real-time, while an on-board computer analyzes the collected data and outputs an interpreted result. The latter is displayed in the assay report on the integrated LCD touch screen of the cobas® Liat® Analyzer and in an electronic file. The report can be printed directly through a USB or network-connected printer. The results can also be exported to an external server, middleware or data management system, or to a Laboratory Information System (LIS).

# 1.1. Test Workflow

Nasopharyngeal swab can be collected following the user institution’s standard procedures. For nasopharyngeal swab samples suspended in collection media, a user transfers the sample into cobas® Influenza A/B & RSV assay tube.

A user then scans the assay tube barcode to identify the test and scans the sample barcode to code the sample ID using the cobas® Liat® System. The assay tube is then inserted into the cobas® Liat® Analyzer (Figure 1). The analyzer performs all test steps and outputs interpreted results in approximately 20 minutes. A report of the interpreted results can be viewed in the View Results window, and printed directly through a USB connected printer.

# 2. INTENDED USE

The cobas® Influenza A/B & RSV Nucleic acid test for use on the cobas® Liat® System (cobas® Influenza A/B & RSV) is an automated multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay for the rapid in vitro qualitative detection and discrimination of Influenza A virus, Influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RNA in nasopharyngeal swab specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. The test is intended for use as an aid in the differential diagnosis of Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV in humans and is not intended to detect Influenza C.

Negative results do not preclude Influenza virus or RSV infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.

Performance characteristics for Influenza A were established during the 2013-2014 and the 2014-2015 influenza seasons when Influenza A/H3 and A/H1N1 pandemic were the predominant Influenza A viruses in circulation. When other Influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a ${ \mathrm { B S L } } 3 +$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

# 3. TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS

# 4. DESCRIPTION OF CHANGE

cobas® Influenza A/B & RSV Assay Script v1.16 incorporates the following changes:

 Algorithm parameter changed for Influenza A and Influenza B targets to tolerate early Cts previously interpreted as invalid results.   
 Correction of defects (bug fixes).

# 5. DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY SUMMARY

Roche Molecular Diagnostics (RMD), Pleasanton, CA designed and developed the script software component of the cobas® Liat® System. RMD in Pleasanton coordinated the development and verification of cobas® Influenza A/B & RSV Assay Script v1.16 at the Product Requirements, Technical Requirements and Technical Requirement Specifications (Unit Specifications) level. These activities included risk management, requirements management, configuration management, verification testing, and regression analysis.

# 6. ASSAY PERFORMANCE

Performance of the cobas® Influenza A/B & RSV assay with cobas® Influenza A/B & RSV Assay Script v1.16 was assessed by testing multiple sample types on both the predicate configuration (cobas® Influenza A/B & RSV Assay Script v1.15) and the modified configuration (cobas® Influenza A/B & RSV Assay Script v1.16). These sample types included negative controls, positive controls, negative specimens, and positive specimens containing co-formulated Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV target material at a concentration of 3X the Limit of Detection (LoD). For each configuration (cobas® Influenza A/B & RSV Assay Script v1.15 and v1.16), each sample type was run on nine (9) cobas® Liat ® analyzers, and the assay run results for each configuration were compared and assessed for equivalency, based on the result output (for negative controls, positive controls, and negative samples) and mean Ct value (for 3X LoD samples). The results of this testing determined that the overall cobas® Influenza A/B & RSV assay performance claims were not impacted by changes implemented in cobas® Influenza A/B & RSV Assay Script v1.16, when compared to the current commercially available version of the assay script v1.15.

# 7. CONCLUSION

Equivalent performance of the modified device and the current commercial device has been demonstrated, and analytical and clinical performance has not changed. The modified device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, as cleared through K200065 and CLIA waived through CW150018.
