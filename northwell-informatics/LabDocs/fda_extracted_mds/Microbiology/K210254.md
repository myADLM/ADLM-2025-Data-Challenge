# Device Description

The MeMed BV™ (“BV test” or the “test”) is an In-Vitro-Diagnostic device that measures in parallel the blood concentrations of TRAIL, IP-10 and CRP. The test consists of an automated analyzer with built-in hardware and software that conduct chemiluminescencebased analyte measurements of patient serum samples and their computational integration (MeMed Key™), and a disposable cartridge that contains the reagents and controls needed to detect the analytes of interest (MeMed BV™ cartridge). The test generates an answer to each sample, with a test run time of approximately 15 minutes.

# Intended Use / Indications for Use

The MeMed BV™ test is an automated semi-quantitative immunoassay that measures three nonmicrobial (host) proteins (TRAIL, IP-10, and CRP) in adult and pediatric serum samples and is intended for use in conjunction with clinical assessments and other laboratory findings as an aid to differentiate bacterial from viral infection. MeMed BV™ is indicated for use in patients presenting to the emergency department or urgent care center and with samples collected at hospital admission from patients with suspected acute bacterial or viral infection, who have had symptoms for less than seven days. The MeMed BV™ test generates a numeric score that falls within discrete interpretation bins based on the increasing likelihood of bacterial infection.

# Comparison with Predicate Device

The MeMed BV is substantially equivalent to the predicate device the VIDAS B.R.A.H.M.S. PCT (PCT) (K162827). The MeMed BV has similar intended and indications for use, as well as similar basic technological principles to the predicate device. The minor differences in technological characteristics are supported by the performance testing and do not raise any new questions of safety and efficacy. A substantial equivalence table summarizing the similarities and differences between the MeMed BV and its predicate device is provided below.

# Performance Data

1. Analytical performance: a. Limit of Quantitation

The Total Error and precision for the lowest concentration of each measurand that could be reliably measured (i.e., Limit of Quantification or LoQ) by the MeMed BV test was evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2, Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures. The study used two cartridge lots with one MeMed Key analyzer and the samples described in Table 1. Each sample was tested three times on three non-consecutive days.

Table 1. Predefined acceptance criteria for LOQ   

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Analyte</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total Error Accuracy Goal</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>TRAIL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>TE &lt; 30%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>IP-10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>TE &lt; 40%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CRP</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>TE &lt; 30%</td></tr></table>

The TE (total error) was calculated for each of the four concentration levels for three analytes as $_ { 2 \times }$ SD observed.

The results obtained for LLOQ testing on two cartridge lots are summarized in Table 2.

The results show that for all the tested samples, MeMed BV test passes the acceptance criteria of TE. The formal LLOQ is established to values corresponding to TRAIL $- 1 5 p { \mathsf { g } } / { \mathsf { m L } }$ , CRP- $1 \mathrm { \ m g / m L }$ , $\mathsf { I P - } 1 0 - 1 0 0 \mathsf { p g / m L }$ as is set in MeMed Key analyzer.

# b. Reproducibility/Precision:

The repeatability, intermediate precision and reproducibility studies for each measurand (TRAIL/IP-10/CRP) of the MeMed BV™ test were conducted using the MeMed Key™ Analyzer. The MeMed BV test score used a panel of 4 scores representing infectious bacteria, infectious virus, equivocal and noninfectious scores during the studies. Studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3 Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative Measurement Procedures.

The serum panel members representing the MeMed BV test scores used for these studies included the following:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Panel member</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample type</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Score</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>A</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Infectious serum specimen</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>High (Score = 96)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>B</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Infectious serum specimen</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Medium (Score = 53)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>C</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Infectious serum specimen</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Low (Score = 1)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>D</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Healthy serum specimen</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Healthy (Score = 4)</td></tr></table>

The study was performed in three laboratories. The measurements were performed over 5 nonconsecutive days. At each site, a single operator conducted the tests on two different MeMed Key analyzers using one cartridge lot, with three runs performed each day per panel member. Calibration was performed on the first day for each MeMed Key analyzer using one calibrator lot. External Controls were run daily using one lot of external controls.

For each measurand, TRAIL, IP-10, and CRP, the acceptance criteria for measurements was CV $\leq 1 5 \%$ . This acceptance criteria were not applicable to IP-10 and CRP concentration of healthy specimens since the concentrations were expected to be below the LoQ of IP-10 and CRP assays. The acceptance criterion for the MeMed BV test score was set at $\mathsf { S D } < 1 2 . 5$ score units.

The results of the repeatability, intermediate precision and reproducibility studies are summarized below.

The reproducibility results complied with the pre-established acceptance criteria for score and individual analytes.

# c. Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility

A lot-to-lot reproducibility study was conducted to estimate lot-to-lot variance, for each MeMed BV test measurand (TRAIL/IP-10/CRP) and the MeMed BV test score for the four panel members as described in Table 4 above.

The lot-to-lot study was performed on 3 days with one operator at one site using three runs per day for each of the four panel members using two lots of cartridges on one MeMed Key Analyzer. Two calibration lots were used, one for each cartridge lot. External controls were run daily using one lot of External Control reagents.

For each of TRAIL, IP-10, and CRP, the acceptance criterion for measurement was set at $\mathsf { C V } \le 1 5$ $\%$ . This acceptance criteria are not applicable to IP-10 and CRP concentration of healthy individual since it is expected to be below the LoQ of IP-10 and CRP assays.

# d. Linearity

Linearity of the MeMed BV test for each of the three measurands (TRAIL/IP-10/CRP) was evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP06-A Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach. The study was performed in one laboratory with one MeMed Key Analyzer, two lots of cartridges, one lot of calibration reagents and one lot of External Control reagents. Calibration was performed before initiating the study for each cartridge lot. External Controls were run daily.

Four replicates of eleven dilutions of each MeMed BV test measurand were measured in the linearity study. The order of measurement of the dilution series was random. The eleven dilutions used in the study are represented in Table 6.

The linearity criterion is that measurement bias due to non-linearity is less than $10 \%$ or $1 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ for CRP, $10 \%$ or $1 0 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ for TRAIL and $10 \%$ or $5 0 ~ { \mathsf { p } } { \mathsf { g } } / { \mathsf { m L } }$ for IP-10 of the value corresponding to the linear fit. The absolute value thresholds are intended to reflect differences at low concentrations for which defined relative errors result in extremely low absolute value.

Polynomial regression analysis was performed for first-, second- and third-order polynomials.

For CRP and IP-10 Lot 1 and IP-10 Lot 2 significance was identified for second order coefficients.   
However, the degree of non-linearity is within the acceptance criteria.

# e. Hook Effect

A recombinant sample where each analyte was present at the upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ, sample #1) was used as well as three additional samples where each analyte was present at higher concentrations (samples 2-4).

The samples were prepared by spiking protein rich buffer with each of the three measurands (recombinant proteins). This approach was used to generate Sample 1 and 4 as indicated in Table 7. Sample 2 was prepared by mixing Sample 1 and 4 samples in a ratio of 2/3 and $1 / 3$ , respectively. Sample 3 sample was prepared by mixing Level 1 and 4 samples in a ratio of $1 / 3$ and 2/3, respectively. For each concentration level, 3 runs were measured on one MeMed Key Analyzer, on the same day.

Hook effect was determined to be excluded if the responses obtained for concentrations up to level 4 were no less than the response obtained for upper limit of quantification (ULoQ). If one or more of the assessed concentration levels deviated from this criterion, hook effect concentration was established as the lowest concentration for which the obtained response was lower than the response corresponding to ULoQ.

For each concentration level average signal was calculated and compared against the average response obtained for sample 1 (ULOQ). The results are summarized in Table 8.

# f. Carry over

Because each specimen tested with the MeMed BV test is processed in a separate disposable cartridge and within the cartridge, each one of the three immunoassays is processed using a separate disposable filtered tip, with a unique tip dedicated to each measurand, the likelihood of carry over between specimens is negligible. A carry over study was, nonetheless, conducted to address the low risk of potential carry over. Sequential runs of (“L”) and high score (“H”) clinical samples were used in the study. No carry-over was assessed based on 1) the difference between average score of high score sample ran after low score sample and high score sample baseline average score of no more than 12.5 score units; and 2) the difference between average score of low score sample ran after high score sample and low score sample baseline average score of no more than 12.5 score units.

Two clinical samples were run in two sequences 1 and 2 of high to low scores and low to high scores, each sequence on a different MeMed Key analyzer: The high to low score (Table 9) and low to high score (Table 10) are represented below.

The maximal difference in score obtained for high score sample (1 score unit difference) demonstrates that no carry-over occurred with the MeMed BV test.

# g. Interference/Cross Reactivity

Interfering substances and cross-reactants were evaluated for the MeMed BV test score. Each interferent and cross-reactant was tested using two serum panel members that represented score a ‘low’ score of approximately 5 and ‘high’ score of approximately 95. The study was performed in one laboratory using one lot of cartridges, one lot of calibration reagents and one lot of External Control reagents. Each interferant and cross-reactant was tested by 8 repeat runs of spiked and non-spiked sample for each clinical sample using 2 MeMed Key Analyzers.

Master stock interferant/cross reactant solutions were spiked into serum specimens at concentrations of less than $10 \%$ v/v of the total sample volume. Detailed descriptions of each interferant/cross-reactant concentration is provided in Table 11 and Table 12. The Interference/cross reactivity was assessed by comparison of the spiked sample Test result to a non-spiked sample Test result (appropriate diluent/buffer was added to the non-spiked sample). Interference was determined as bias between spiked and non-spiked score results was $\pm \nobreakspace 1 2 . 5 \nobreakspace$ score units.

The data shows that the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval for the bias lies within $+ / - 1 2 . 5$ score units for all the interferants and cross-reactants in the indicated concentrations for both bacterial and viral clinical samples. Thus, it can be concluded that there is no interference or cross-reactivity caused by the above mentioned compounds at the indicated concentrations.

# h. Human Anti-Mouse Antibody (HAMA) Interference

Interference of human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) was conducted by a dose-response experimental design consisting of 5 serum levels with different amounts of HAMA: Low Pool as described in Table 13 below. The Interference of HAMA was assessed by a comparison of TRAIL, CRP, and IP10 concentrations in the measured serum samples to their nominal concentration values.

Each sample was run on 2 MeMed Key Analyzers with a total of 8 repeats for each sample. The acceptance criterion was that TRAIL, CRP, and IP10 concentrations, when run on clinical serum sample mixed with HAMA positive sample, shall measure concentrations within $+ / .$ - $10 \%$ compared to their nominal concentration. The interference of HAMA on analytes concentration was examined by two independent experiments using two different HAMA-positive samples.

For both HAMA samples the recovery of TRAIL, IP-10 and CRP are within the $+ / - 1 0 \%$ . The results show that the three assays are tolerant to high HAMA concentrations.

# i. In-Use Stability

An in-use stability study was conducted to demonstrate the allowable handling conditions from blood draw to serum sample input into the cartridge. Stability was assessed for each MeMed BV test measurand (TRAIL/IP-10/CRP) and the MeMed BV test resulting score for four patient serum panel members representing two samples with ‘low’ scores of approximately 5 and two samples with ‘high’ scores of approximately 95 as described in Table 14.

The study was performed in one laboratory on four days, one day per panel member. Three MeMed Key analyzers and one lot of cartridges were used. Calibration was performed at the beginning of the study using one lot of calibration reagents.

Table 14. Patient specimens (panel members)   

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Panel member</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample type</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Score</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Number of patients</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>A1, A2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Infectious serum specimen</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>High (scoreapproximately 95)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>B1, B2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Infectious serum specimen</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Low (scoreapproximately 5)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td></tr></table>

For each panel member, the incubations listed Table 15 were performed with the package insert indicated SST tube before centrifugation and testing with the MeMed BV Test. There were three replicate runs for each time point performed in parallel on three MeMed Key analyzers.

Table 15. Incubation Time at Room Temperature   

<table><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">SSTTube #</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Time at room temp before centrifugation (mins)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">30 (shortest time for coagulation according to the IFU of BD SST Vacutainer)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">60</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">90</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">4</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">120</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">5</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">150</td></tr></table>

The mean values, regression lines, confidence intervals and significance level of the difference of the slope from 0 were examined for each of the incubation times. The minimum acceptable incubation time was approximately 130 minutes and the incubation time before an observed failure was 120 minutes. Thus, the 120 minute time period at room temperature before centrifugation preparation for use in the MeMed BV test was established as 120 minutes.

# j. Freeze-thaw stability

A study was conducted to validate stability between fresh and frozen specimens. This study examined the stability of the MeMed BV test result (score) using 40 paired fresh and frozen specimens as indicated in Table 16. The study was performed in one laboratory. Each sample was tested three times on the same MeMed Key analyzer using one lot of cartridges and one lot of calibrator reagents. Calibration was performed on the first day and repeated after two weeks.

Table 16. Sample Score Ranges and Specimen Numbers per Score   

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Score bin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Interpretation</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1># of specimen tested</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>90 ≤s≤100</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>High likelihood ofbacterial infection</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>12</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>65 &lt; s &lt;90</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Moderate likelihood ofbacterial infection</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>35≤s≤65</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Equivocal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10 &lt; s&lt;35</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Moderate likelihood ofviral infection</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0≤s≤10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>High likelihood of viralinfection</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>12</td></tr></table>

The acceptance criteria for equivalency between fresh and frozen specimens for the score was that all scores within the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval are within a move of within the same or adjacent score categories and do not result in a move between non-adjacent scores.

Passing Bablok regression was used to compare the means of results from the fresh and the frozen specimens. A $9 5 \%$ confidence interval for the regression was calculated using bootstraping.

The confidence intervals do not intersect the lines representing the adjacent test scores and demonstrates the frozen and fresh samples demonstrated score results corresponding to the same or adjacent scores within the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval, thus demonstrating equivalency between fresh and frozen samples for the MeMed BV test.

# k. Calibrator Traceability

The company conducted metrological traceability testing of the MeMed BV™ multi-standard calibrator material to ensure that analytical results used for patient care are accurate as well as consistent over time and when using different devices and systems.

All three analytes are traceable to a standard. The material was produced following ISO Guide 34:2009. The test was performed to assign the TRAIL, CRP and IP10 portion of the Master LotCalibrator a concentration that is based on their respective reference standard, in order to assign a value to the MeMed BV Calibrators. The test was performed with a calibration curve.

Lastly, testing was conducted to verify that the released calibrators are able to accurately quantify known samples on the MeMed Key analyzer using MeMed BV cartridges. The Lot was released only if all the parameters comply with the acceptance criteria.

l. Calibrator, External Controls, and Cartridges Stability Testing

MeMed BV calibrators (i.e., CAL1, CAL2, and CAL3), external controls (ECs), and cartridges were subjected to real time stability, in-use stability, transportation stability, shelf life validation, stability monitoring, and calibration interval testing (for ECs and calibrators only) in order to show that they maintain their respective performance characteristics over a defined time interval under indicated storage conditions. MeMed BV cartridges were also subjected to calibration interval testing.

The results of this testing demonstrated that the calibrators, ECs have a shelf life of 3.5 months and the cartridges have a shelf life of 12 months.

# m. Reference Interval

Reference Interval study, conducted based on CLSI EP28-A3c Defining, Establishing, and Verifying Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory, demonstrated that:

The lower limit of the score (corresponding to the 2.5th percentile) is 0 $[ 9 0 \%$ CI: 0-1].

The upper limit of the score (corresponding to the 97.5th percentile) is 46 $[ 9 0 \%$ CI: 36-75].

# Clinical Studies

# a. Apollo Clinical Study

The diagnostic performance of the MeMed BV™ test was established by a prospective, multicenter, observational, blinded study. The primary objective of the Apollo clinical study was to establish the diagnostic performance of the MeMed BV™ test for differentiating bacterial from viral infection in patients with suspected acute bacterial or viral infection using expert adjudication comparator method (forced diagnosis for indeterminate cases) with the experts blinded to Creactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) values. A secondary objective was to establish the diagnostic performance of MeMed BV™ for differentiating bacterial from viral infection using expert adjudication comparator method (indeterminate cases removed from analysis) with the experts given CRP and PCT values. This study included 1,016 infectious subjects (476 prospectively recruited adult and pediatric patients and 540 archived cases) from 11 medical centers (9 in the US and 2 in Israel). The study population comprised hospital admitted, Emergency Department (ED) and urgent care center patients over the age of 90 days, with suspected acute bacterial or viral infection, and healthy subjects.

The bins used in the study correspond to Table 16.

Figure 1: Primary Objective Cohort Disposition

\*Viral includes viral and non-infectious comparator method outcomes

The performance of MeMed BV™ test in differentiating between bacterial and viral infection was assessed in the primary objective cohort using two pre-specified statistical tests:

The Cochran–Armitage (CA) Test demonstrated a significant trend in increasing probability of bacterial infection with higher MeMed BV™ score $( \mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1 )$ ).   
The $9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval (CI) of the Likelihood Ratio (LR) for some of the bins (Bins 1,2,4,5) excluded 1 (Table 17).

These statistical tests validate that the higher the score, the higher the likelihood of a bacterial infection and therefore the study successfully achieves its the primary objective.

# Subgroup Analyses

For both the primary and secondary objective cohort, the MeMed $\mathsf { B V } ^ { \mathsf { T M } }$ score increased significantly with the likelihood of bacterial infection irrespective of sex, age, ethnicity, race, preenrollment antibiotics, time from symptom onset, and comorbidities (hypertension, ischemic heart disease, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and COPD adults). As expected, there was a difference in bacterial prevalence in children versus adults (e.g., in the primary objective cohort $10 . 6 \%$ versus $1 9 . 5 \%$ , respectively). Nevertheless, both statistical tests of performance were passed for all ages.

Based on the clinical performance as documented in the clinical study, the MeMed BV™ test has a safety and effectiveness profile that is similar to the predicate device.

# Conclusions

The MeMed BV™ is as safe and effective as the VIDAS B.R.A.H.M.S. PCT (PCT) (K162827). The MeMed BV™ and the predicate test have the same general intended use and similar indications for use, technological characteristics and principles of operation.

In addition, the minor technological differences between the MeMed BV™ test and its predicate devices raise no new issues of safety or effectiveness. Performance data demonstrate that the MeMed BV™ is as safe and effective as the VIDAS B.R.A.H.M.S. PCT (PCT). Thus, the MeMed BV™ is substantially equivalent.
