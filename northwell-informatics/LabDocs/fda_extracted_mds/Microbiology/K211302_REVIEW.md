# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The Elecsys Syphilis immunoassay is a fully automated, qualitative assay that uses a double antigen sandwich format for the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies to $T .$ pallidum (TP). Recombinant T. pallidum antigens labeled with either biotin or a ruthenium complex bind to T. pallidum-specific IgG or IgM to form a double antigen sandwich complex. The sandwich complex binds to streptavidin-coated microparticles which can be immobilized magnetically to the surface of an electrode. Unbound substances are removed during a wash step using ProCell. A chemiluminescent substrate is then added to the reaction tube. Application of a voltage to the electrode induces a chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier.

The presence or absence of anti-TP antibodies in the specimen is determined by comparing the chemiluminescent signal in the reaction to the cutoff index (COI) determined from an active calibration. The strength of the signal generated is proportional to the amount of bound enzyme and thus the amount of anti-T. pallidum antibodies present in the specimen. If the chemiluminescent signal in the reaction is greater than or equal to the cutoff signal, the specimen is considered reactive for anti-TP antibodies. If the chemiluminescent signal is below the cutoff signal, the specimen is considered nonreactive for the anti-TP antibodies.

The results are reported out as follows:

$\mathrm { C O I } \geq 1 . 0 0 $ Reactive $\mathrm { C O I } < 1 . 0 0 $ Nonreactive

Interpretation of results:

Reactive Reactive for treponemal antibodies Nonreactive Nonreactive for treponemal antibodies

Test results are intended to aid in diagnosis only. As with all serological tests for syphilis, results should always be interpreted in conjunction with additional treponemal or nontreponemal serologic test results (as appropriate), the patient’s clinical symptoms, medical history, and other clinical and/or laboratory findings to produce a diagnosis of syphilis by disease stage.

All initially reactive samples should be retested in duplicate with the Elecsys Syphilis assay. If cutoff index values $< 1 . 0 0$ are found in both cases, the samples are considered negative for anti-Treponema pallidum antibodies.

Initially reactive samples with cutoff index values of $\geq 1 . 0 0$ in either of the retests are considered repeatedly reactive. Repeatedly reactive samples must be confirmed according to recommended confirmatory algorithms.

The PreciControl Syphilis 1 and 2 controls and Syphilis Cal1 and Cal2 calibrators are for use with the Elecsys Syphilis Assay.

# B Principle of Operation:

This is a fully automated electrochemiluminescence immunoassay.

# A Analytical Performance:

A limited number of studies were conducted to verify the assay performance cleared under K160910 was not affected by the changes made to improve tolerance to elevated levels of biotin.

1. Internal Precision:

The precision of the Elecsys Syphilis assay was evaluated in an internal study using seven human serum samples, the PreciControl 1 and PreciControl 2 controls, and one lot of reagent. Two replicates of each serum sample and control were tested two times per day for 21 days. Human serum samples were prepared to create a panel of two negative samples $( \mathrm { C O I } < 1 . 0 $ ), one low positive samples (COI approximately $= 1 . 0$ ), and four positive samples $( \mathrm { C O I } > 1 . 0 ) $ ). The mean COI value, Repeatability Standard Deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of variation $( \% C V )$ as well as Intermediate Precision SD and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ were calculated for each group of samples. A summary of the results is shown below.

\*Upper Confidence Limit

Multi-site Reproducibility:

See K160910

2. Linearity:

Not applicable; this is a qualitative assay.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Potential interference with specimens containing biotin was evaluated by testing three anti- $T .$ pallidum antibody concentrations (negative, near cut-off and positive). One aliquot of each serum sample was spiked with the interfering substance (biotin), another aliquot was spiked with the same volume of the respective solvent (dilution pool). The interfering pool was then incrementally diluted into the dilution pool. The recovery for each sample was calculated by comparison to the analyte concentration of the respective dilution pools.

The results of the study support the following statement in the assay labeling:

Specimens that contain biotin at a concentration of 1200 ng/mL demonstrate less than or equal to $10 \%$ negative bias in COI values.

For complete endogenous substances interference study results see K160910.

The study showed $100 \%$ agreement of the qualitative results and regression analysis of the COI values demonstrated acceptable concordance between the assays. The results of the original method comparison study are found in K160910.
