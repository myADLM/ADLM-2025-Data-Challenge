# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The BioTeke Sterile Disposable Virus Sampling Swab Kit is a specimen collection and transport kit designed to collect a throat or nasal sample from the patient (utilizing the provided Specimen Collection Swab) and subsequently transferring the swab containing the patient’s microbial sample into the provide $1 0 \mathrm { m L }$ polymer tube containing $3 \mathrm { m L }$ of VTM (Virus Transport Media) for purposes of transferring the swab and associated collected microorganisms into a transport container designed to preserve the sample during transport to the laboratory prior to laboratory analysis. The Specimen Collection Swab is designed with a break point (notched area on the shaft) to allow for the top of the VTM tube to close when the inoculated Specimen Collection Swab is placed into the BioTeke VTM tube. The BioTeke Sterile Disposable Virus Sampling Swab Kit consists of the following:

• One (1) Specimen Collection Swab (sterile and individually packaged) One (1) Virus Transport Media (10mLpolymer tube containing $3 \mathrm { m L }$ of sterile VTM)

The Specimen Collection Swab measures $1 5 0 \mathrm { m m }$ with a breakpoint location (from the tip) at $8 0 \mathrm { m m }$ , a head length at $2 0 \mathrm { m m }$ and a head width of $3 \mathrm { m m }$ . The width of the shaft for the Specimen Collection Swab measures $2 . 5 \mathrm { m m }$ . The $1 0 \mathrm { m L }$ polymer tubes are filled with $3 \mathrm { m L }$ of Virus Transport Media (VTM) and secured with a leak-proof polymer cap.

# B Principle of Operation:

The swab is used to collect nasal or throat samples.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods): The ability of BioTeke Sterile Disposable Virus Sampling Kit to maintain viability of respiratory viruses was assessed by virus culture after storage at various conditions (time and time). Viruses were diluted in matrix at approximately $3 \mathrm { X }$ the Limit of Detection (LoD) prior to transfer into the VTM. The results demonstrate that the viruses, influenza, RSV A, RSV B, parainfluenza, adenovirus and rhinovirus stored at $2 3 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ were maintained within $0 . 2 5 \log$ (PFU/mL) of the input concentration of virus for 48 hours as described in the table below.
