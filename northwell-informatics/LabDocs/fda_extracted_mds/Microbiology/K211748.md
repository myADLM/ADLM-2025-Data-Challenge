Dear Patricia Shrader:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's

requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97).

# Device Description

The Selux AST System for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) consists of a Sample Prep Station, an Inoculator, an Analyzer, a computer workstation, and the reagents and consumables required to perform AST testing. The system is operated via software that guides users through the manual sample preparation process and operates the automated Inoculator and Analyzer. The software includes an algorithm that enables the system to determine the susceptibilities of an organism to the variety of antimicrobials under test.

The system is designed so that only Gram stain information is required to initiate testing (to select the proper antimicrobial panel, gram-negative or gram-positive). While complete system testing can be performed without species-level identification (ID), this information is required for the system to report susceptibility results. Species ID can be performed by any appropriate method and this information can be either manually input to the Selux system or automatically downloaded from the laboratory information system (LIS) at any time, once the sample ID is entered into the LIS.

The system utilizes 384-well panels to provide parallel results for a large number of antimicrobials.   
Its average time-to-result is under 6 hours, as demonstrated in various studies.

# Principle of Operation

The Selux platform performs AST similarly to the reference broth microdilution method by first incubating samples, then quantifying microbial growth in each well of an antimicrobial dilution series after a growth period, and finally determining the MIC by comparing growth data in each well. The Selux AST test requires that the Gram type (Classification) of the organism be known prior to testing as the information is necessary to select the proper AST panel to use. The organism identification (ID) need not be known for Selux AST processing to be performed. However, the organism ID is necessary for a result to be obtained because the MIC-determining algorithm is species-specific as is the interpretative Susceptible, Intermediate, or Resistant (SIR) determination. Any FDA-cleared method may be used to provide an ID including biochemical techniques, matrixassisted laser desorption/isotherm mass spectrometry, and multiplex genetic assays.

To ensure accurate results, the Selux method initiates antimicrobial susceptibility assays only after sufficient microorganism replication has occurred. Following determination of sufficient growth, two complementary metabolic assays are performed that quantify microbial growth, namely an indicator assay to estimate the number of bacteria present and a surface binding assay. These data are input to an MIC-determining algorithm that provides results when organism IDs are available. The sufficient growth assay ensures that the metabolic reagents used for the high-sensitivity organism quantification assays are not added until after sufficient microbial growth has occurred. To get an accurate reading of microbial replication, the sufficient growth assay monitors growth in dedicated AST panel wells that contain organisms and cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton Broth but no antimicrobials or probes. Sufficient growth assay wells are monitored by fluorescence to those wells which the standard viability assay pair resazurin/methylene blue have been added and/or by optical absorbance.

Two probe-based assays, a viability assay and a surface area assay, commence across all wells in the panel after the sufficient growth threshold has been met. Both of these assays are performed in each AST panel well, providing two complementary datasets for each well.

# Reproducibility

Inter-site reproducibility was evaluated by testing a minimum of 25 isolates for each of the 24 antimicrobials at each of three test sites that participated in the clinical study. Each isolate was tested once at each site for a total of three results per isolate (minimum of 75 results per antimicrobial). Best-case inter-site reproducibility was $2 9 5 \%$ and worst-case inter-site reproducibility was $2 8 9 \%$ (see following table).

Intra-site reproducibility was evaluated at a single site that participated in the inter-site reproducibility testing and the clinical study. A minimum of 5 isolates for each antimicrobial were tested in triplicate at the site from three separate inoculums on three separate days for a minimum total of 45 results per antimicrobial. Best-case intra-site reproducibility was $2 9 5 \%$ and worst-case intra-site reproducibility was $2 8 9 \%$ (see following table).

Clinical performance testing on the Selux AST System was performed at three test sites. Contemporary and frozen clinical isolates from diverse geographic locations across the US were evaluated for performance as were banked challenge isolates, which were selected for their resistance profiles. A total of 1401 clinical (426 contemporary and 975 stock) and 222 challenge isolates from 12 Enterobacterales species, Acinetobacter baumannii complex, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested to evaluate the Selux AST System performance for 24 antimicrobials. Depending on the spectrum of activity, breakpoints, and the claimed organisms (species/group)

for each antimicrobial on the panel, the number of datapoints for the various antimicrobialorganisms tested varied and ranged from 165 (e.g. P. aeruginosa/Imipenem-Relebactam) to 977 (e.g. Enterobacterales/Ertapenem).

Selux AST System performance was determined by comparing Selux AST System results with triplicate broth microdilution results performed at an independent reference laboratory. The Selux AST System meets performance criteria for each indication and is given in the following table, where performance is summarized by reporting group. Additionally, QC testing was performed every day testing was performed at each site and met the $9 5 \%$ performance criteria for all antimicrobials.
