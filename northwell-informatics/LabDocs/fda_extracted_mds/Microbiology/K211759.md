# Device Description

The Selux AST System for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) consists of a Sample Prep Station, an Inoculator, an Analyzer, a computer workstation, and the reagents and consumables required to perform AST testing. The system is operated via software that guides users through the manual sample preparation process and operates the automated Inoculator and Analyzer. The software includes an algorithm that enables the system to determine the susceptibilities of an organism to the variety of antimicrobials under test.

The system is designed so that only Gram stain information is required to initiate testing (to select the proper antimicrobial panel, gram-negative or gram-positive). While complete system testing can be performed without species-level identification (ID), this information is required for the system to report susceptibility results. Species ID can be performed by any appropriate method and this information can be either manually input to the Selux system or automatically downloaded from the laboratory information system (LIS) at any time, once the sample ID is entered into the LIS.

The system utilizes 384-well panels to provide parallel results for a large number of antimicrobials.   
Its average time-to-result is under 6 hours, as demonstrated in various studies.

# Principle of Operation

The Selux platform performs AST similarly to the reference broth microdilution method7 by first incubating samples, then quantifying microbial growth in each well of an antimicrobial dilution series after a growth period, and finally determining the MIC by comparing growth data in each well. The Selux AST test requires that the Gram type (Classification) of the organism be known prior to testing as the information is necessary to select the proper AST panel to use.8 The organism identification (ID) need not be known for Selux AST processing to be performed. However, the organism ID is necessary for a result to be obtained because the MIC-determining algorithm is species-specific as is the interpretative Susceptible, Intermediate, or Resistant (SIR) determination. Any FDA-cleared method may be used to provide an ID including biochemical techniques, matrixassisted laser desorption/isotherm mass spectrometry, and multiplex genetic assays.

To ensure accurate results, the Selux method initiates antimicrobial susceptibility assays only after sufficient microorganism replication has occurred. Following determination of sufficient growth, two complementary metabolic assays are performed that quantify microbial growth, namely an indicator assay to estimate the number of bacteria present and a surface binding assay. These data are input to an MIC-determining algorithm that provides results when organism IDs are available. The sufficient growth assay ensures that the metabolic reagents used for the high-sensitivity organism quantification assays are not added until after sufficient microbial growth has occurred. To get an accurate reading of microbial replication, the sufficient growth assay monitors growth in dedicated AST panel wells that contain organisms and cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton Broth but no antimicrobials or probes. Sufficient growth assay wells are monitored by fluorescence to those wells which the standard viability assay pair resazurin/methylene blue have been added and/or by optical absorbance.

Two probe-based assays, a viability assay and a surface area assay, commence across all wells in the panel after the sufficient growth threshold has been met. Both of these assays are performed in each AST panel well, providing two complementary datasets for each well.

# Reproducibility

Intra-site reproducibility was evaluated at a single site that participated in the inter-site reproducibility testing and the clinical study. A minimum of 5 isolates for each antimicrobial were tested in triplicate from three separate inoculums on three separate days for a total of 45 results per antimicrobial. Best-case intra-site reproducibility was $2 9 5 \%$ and worst-case intra-site reproducibility was $2 8 9 \%$ (see following table). Please note the best-case intra-site reproducibility for erythromycin is $9 3 . 6 \%$ , which is ${ < } 9 5 \%$ ; however, reproducibility testing at two other sites were $100 \%$ .

Clinical performance testing on the Selux AST System was performed at three test sites. Contemporary and frozen clinical isolates from diverse geographic locations across the US were evaluated for performance as well as stock (frozen/banked) challenge isolates, which were selected for their rare resistance profiles. A total of 706 clinical (193 contemporary and 513 stock) and 159 challenge samples from 11 Staphylococci and 2 Enterococci species were tested to evaluate the Selux AST System performance for 14 antimicrobials and one screening test, the Cefoxitin Screen. Depending on the spectrum of activity, breakpoints and the claimed organisms (species/group) for each antimicrobial on the panel, the number of datapoints for the various antimicrobial-organisms tested varied and ranged from 39 (e.g. S. lugdunensis/Oxacillin) to 311 (e.g. Staphylococcus/Clindamycin).

Selux AST System performance was determined by comparing Selux AST System results with triplicate broth microdilution results performed at an independent reference laboratory. The Selux AST System meets performance criteria for each indication and is given in the following table summarized by reporting group. Additionally, QC testing was performed every day testing was performed at each site and met the $9 5 \%$ performance criteria for all antimicrobials.
