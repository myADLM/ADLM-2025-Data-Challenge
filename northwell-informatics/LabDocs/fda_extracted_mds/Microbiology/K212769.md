# 6. Device Description

The DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit (SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay) uses multiplex immunoassay, a methodology that greatly resembles traditional ELISA, while permits simultaneous detection and identification of different antibodies in a single well. The reaction is processed in a 96 well microtiter plate, with six polystyrene beads embedded in each well of the plate. Four (4) different beads are coated with antigens for the detection of IgG antibodies to Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella-Zoster virus in human serum. Two additional beads are included in each reaction well as filler beads. Specimen processing is fully automated on the Multiplier Analyzer.

The Multiplier Analyzer adds the patient serum specimen and reagents to each well of the 96- well plate, after which the mixture is incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ with shaking. After a wash cycle, unbound antibodies from the patient’s specimen are removed. Anti-human polyclonal IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is added after which the mixture is incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ with shaking. A second wash step removes excess conjugate, then luminol substrate is added to each well. The amount of antibody captured by the antigen is determined by the chemiluminescence triggered by the attached HRP. Raw data is captured as light photons which are converted into relative light intensity units (RLU).

The Multiplier software analyzes the image and generates a report that details the mean RLU signal for each target bead (MMRV) by test sample. In every assay a calibrator is run. The DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit is qualitative and produces a result defined as negative (NEG), equivocal (EQV) or positive (POS) for each target analyte. The result is calculated in the Multiplier software by dividing the test sample RLU values by the mean calibrator RLU value to produce an index value for each target.

# Interpretation of results of the DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit:

The results for each of the antibodies are expressed in Index units. For Measles, Mumps, Rubella and VZV antibodies, results with Index values $\leq 0 . 9$ Index are reported as Negative, results between ${ > } 0 . 9$ and $< 1 . 1$ Index are reported as Equivocal, and results of $\geq 1 . 1$ Index are reported as positive, as indicated in Table 1 below:

# B. Reproducibility study

A reproducibility of the DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit was conducted evaluating 22 serum samples at three sites located in the US using one kit and one

Multiplier Analyzer per site. Samples were tested in duplicate, two times a day, over 20 days for a total of 240 replicates per sample (one sample x two replicates x two runs per day x 20 days x 3 sites $= 2 4 0$ results per sample). The mean, standard deviation, and $\% 0 \%$ were calculated for intra and inter-assay precision and inter-lot and inter-site precision for Measles, Mumps, Rubella and VZV, as shown in Tables 7A-7D below.

# C. Within-Laboratory Precision study

A within-laboratory precision study was conducted evaluating 22 serum samples using three lots of the DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit and 1 DYNEX Multiplier Analyzer. Samples were tested in duplicate, two times a day for 20 days, for a total of 240 replicates per sample across all three-reagent kit lots (one sample x two replicates x two runs x 20 days x three reagent kit lots $= 2 4 0$ results per sample) to measure reagent lot-to-lot precision, as shown in Tables 8A-8D below.

# D. Method Comparison Testing

Performance of the DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit was evaluated against corresponding commercially available Measles, Mumps, Rubella and VZV immunoassays using a total of 2512 retrospective serum samples. Serum specimens from adults $( N { = } 1 6 7 6 )$ , pregnant woman $( N = 5 0 0 )$ and pediatric $N { = } 3 3 6$ ) were evaluated.

The method comparison testing was performed at two US laboratory testing sites using a total of 2512 retrospective human serum specimens obtained from commercial vendors (Table 9).

# To demonstrate the clinical performance of the DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit, Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) and Negative Percent Agreement (NPA)

between the results of the DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit and an FDAcleared comparator tests were calculated.

At the end of the study, specimens with reported Equivocal results on the test device (DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit) and comparator device were identified and retested in accordance with their Instructions for Use (IFUs). If the Equivocal Specimens remain Equivocal on the comparator device, they were retested with two additional FDA cleared methods. Specimen results from all 3 comparator devices were interpreted by a “2/3 rule” in which a comparator algorithm was used to obtain a consensus. The results from the comparator algorithm were then compared to the SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay results using a 3 by 3 analysis approach in which any remaining equivocal results were counted against the clinical performance of the SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay. The 3 by 3 analysis approach was used to calculate the Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) and Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) for the SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit and the “Final Comparator Result”.

# E. Potential Cross-Reactivity

Potential cross-reactivity for the DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit was determined by testing serum samples from individuals containing antibodies to other microorganisms or with medical conditions unrelated to MMRV infections. This study was performed to determine whether IgG antibodies in serum specimens from patients with known infectious diseases interfere with the reported results of the DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit generating false positive results. Serum specimens that were IgG antibody positive for the infectious disease agents shown in Table 12 were used for the study. These specimens were obtained from vendors and confirmed negative with the predicate MMRV assays prior to testing with the DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit. All potential cross-reactants samples were tested in duplicate, with the DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay. The results were compared to the results obtained from the predicate test (summarized in the table below). All specimens evaluated were negative with both assays, except one specimen for HSV 2. The HSV 2 sample had an Equivocal result for Mumps with the DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit while had a high negative result with the Trinity predicate assay.

The DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit cross reactivity study was not evaluated sufficiently for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg), Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV1), Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV2), Toxoplasma gondii due to the lack of samples availability of samples that are positive for the disease states but negative for each of the measurands.

Note: \* One HSV 2 sample had an Equivocal result for Mumps with the DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit while had a high negative result with the Trinity predicate assay. \*\* Potential cross-reactivity was not well assessed due to limited sample size. ‡ Three measurands were evaluated together for potential cross reactivity.

# F. Interfering Substances

The DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit was evaluated for potential interference of endogenous substances using negative, low positive, and high positive serum samples for Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and VZV antibodies spiked with potential interfering substances. A non-spiked sample was used as a control for each measurand. No interference was observed at the maximum concentrations listed in Table 13.

# G. Shelf Life

The shelf-life stability of the DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit was evaluated for storage at ${ 2 / 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } }$ for up to 25 months. Unopened test kits were stored and tested at one month intervals using human specimens. The results demonstrated that unopened SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit is stable at ${ 2 / 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } }$ for up to 19 months. The self-life storage of the unopened DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit is assigned as 18 months at the recommended storage temperature of ${ 2 } { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ .

# 10.CONCLUSION:

The performance data as documented above demonstrates that the DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit performs comparably to the predicate device that is currently marketed for the same intended use.
