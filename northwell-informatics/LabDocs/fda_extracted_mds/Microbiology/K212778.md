# 5.4 Device Description

Alinity m EBV is an in vitro polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the quantitation of EBV DNA in human plasma.

The steps of the Alinity m EBV assay consist of sample preparation, real-time PCR assembly, amplification/detection, result calculation, and reporting. All stages of the Alinity m EBV procedure are executed automatically by the Alinity m System. No intermediate processing or transfer steps are performed by the user. The Alinity m System is designed to be a random-access analyzer that can perform the Alinity m EBV assay in parallel with other Alinity m assays on the same instrument.

Alinity m EBV requires three separate assay specific kits as follows:

Alinity m EBV AMP Kit (List No. 09N43-095) consisting of multi-well amplification trays (AMP Trays) containing lyophilized, unit-dose PCR amplification/detection reagents and multi-well activation trays (ACT Trays) containing liquid, unit-dose activation reagents $\mathrm { ( M g C l } _ { 2 }$ , TMAC, KCl, and ProClin). The intended storage condition for the Alinity m EBV AMP Kit is $2 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C }$ to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .

Alinity m EBV CTRL Kit (List No. 09N43-085) consisting of a negative control, a low positive control, and a high positive control, each supplied as liquid in single-use tubes. The intended storage condition for the Alinity m EBV CTRL Kit is $- 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $- 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Alinity m EBV CAL Kit (List No. 09N43-075) consisting of two levels of calibrators (CAL A and CAL B), each supplied as liquid in single-use tubes. The intended storage condition for the Alinity m EBV CAL Kit is $- 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $- 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

EBV DNA from specimens is extracted automatically on-board in the Alinity m System using the Alinity m Sample Prep Kit 2, Alinity m Lysis Solution, and Alinity m Diluent Solution. The Alinity m System employs magnetic microparticle technology to facilitate nucleic acid capture, wash and elution. The resulting purified nucleic acids are then combined with the liquid unit-dose Alinity m EBV activation reagent and lyophilized unit-dose Alinity m EBV amplification/detection reagents and transferred into a reaction vessel. Alinity m Vapor Barrier Solution is then added to the reaction vessel which is then transferred to an amplification/detection unit for PCR amplification and real-time fluorescence detection of EBV targets.

An EBV calibration curve is required for the quantitation of EBV targets. Two levels of calibrators are processed through sample preparation and real-time PCR to generate the calibration curve. The concentration of EBV DNA in specimens and controls is then calculated from the stored calibration curve.

Assay controls are tested at or above an established minimum frequency to help ensure that instrument and reagent performance remain satisfactory. During each control event, a negative control, a low-positive control, and a high-positive control are processed through sample preparation and real-time PCR procedures that are identical to those used for specimens.

At the beginning of the Alinity m EBV sample preparation process, a lyophilized unit -dose of Internal Control on the AMP Tray is rehydrated by the Alinity m System and delivered into each sample preparation reaction. The Internal Control is then processed through the entire sample preparation and real-time PCR procedure along with the specimens, calibrators and controls to demonstrate proper sample processing and assay validity.

The Alinity m EBV amplification and detection reagents include primers and probes that amplify and detect dual targets in the EBV genome. Amplification and detection of the two EBV targets ensures sensitive detection of the viral genome even at low levels.

The Alinity m EBV assay also utilizes the following accessories:

• Alinity m EBV Application Specification File, List No. 09N43-05A • Alinity m System and System Software, List No. 08N53-002 • Alinity m Sample Prep Kit 2, List No. 09N12-001 • Alinity m Specimen Dilution Kit I, List No. 09N50-001

# 5.5 Intended Use

Alinity m EBV AMP Kit

Alinity m EBV is an in vitro polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the quantitation of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) DNA in human EDTA plasma on the automated Alinity m System.

Alinity m EBV is intended for use as an aid in the management of EBV in transplant patients. In patients undergoing monitoring of EBV, serial DNA measurements can be used to indicate the need for potential treatment changes and to assess viral response to treatment.

The results from Alinity m EBV must be interpreted within the context of all relevant clinical and laboratory findings. Alinity m EBV is not cleared for use as a screening test for donors of blood, blood products, or human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) for EBV.

# 5.6 Similarities and Differences to Predicate Devices

The primary functional components of the Alinity m EBV assay are substantially equivalent to other legally marketed nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) intended for the quantitative detection of EBV DNA.

The Alinity m EBV assay has the same general intended use as the predicate device. Although there are some technological differences between the Alinity m EBV assay and the predicate device, these differences do not raise new types of safety or effectiveness questions.

These devices are similar in that they are designed to prepare nucleic acids for amplification, amplify specific EBV DNA sequences, detect the amplified products, and report quantitative results.

The primary similarities and differences between the Alinity EBV assay and the predicate device are shown in Table 1.

# 5.7 Performance Data

The following performance data were provided in support of the safety, effectiveness and substantial equivalence determination of the device.

# 5.7.1 Specific Performance Characteristics

# 5.7.1.1 Traceability to the WHO Standard

Primary calibrators and assay product calibrators with known concentrations were used throughout product development and product manufacturing to establish traceability to the $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard for Epstein-Barr virus for Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques (NIBSC code: 09/260). The concentrations tested for the WHO standard were 3.00 Log IU/mL and 5.00 Log IU/mL. The target concentrations tested for the primary calibrators were 3.00 Log IU/mL and 7.00 Log IU/mL. The Alinity m EBV product calibrators and controls were also tested along with the primary calibrators and the WHO standard. All of the tested material had observed EBV concentrations similar to the target concentrations, and were linear across the assay’s quantitation range, as presented in Figure 1.

# 5.7.1.4 Linear Range

The quantitation range of Alinity m EBV is from the lower limit of quantitation (LLoQ) of $5 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ (1.70 Log IU/mL) to the upper limit of quantitation (ULoQ) of 200,000,000 IU/mL (8.30 Log IU/mL).

Linearity of Alinity m EBV was assessed by testing a dilution series of EBV type 1 in negative human plasma, consisting of 16 panel levels targeted in the range of $1 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to 400,000,000 IU/mL (1.00 Log IU/mL to 8.60 Log IU/mL). Panel levels with concentrations from $1 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to $1 { , } 5 0 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ (1.00 Log IU/mL to 3.18 Log IU/mL) were prepared using clinical specimen, while panel levels with concentrations from $1 5 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to 400,000,000 IU/mL (1.18 Log IU/mL to 8.60 Log IU/mL) were prepared using synthetic DNA. Panel quantitation values were traceable to the 1st World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard for Epstein-Barr Virus for Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques (NIBSC code: 09/260).

Alinity m EBV was linear across the quantitation range from $5 0 ~ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to 200,000,000 IU/mL (1.70 Log IU/mL to 8.30 Log IU/mL). Representative results for Alinity m EBV linearity performance are shown in Figure 2.

15 IU/mL to 400,000,000 IU/mL (1.18 Log IU/mL to 8.60 Log IU/mL) were prepared using synthetic DNA. Panel quantitation values were traceable to the 1st World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard for Epstein-Barr Virus for Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques (NIBSC code: 09/260).

Alinity m EBV was linear across the quantitation range from 50 IU/mL to 200,000,000 IU/mL (1.70 Log IU/mL to 8.30 Log IU/mL) for EBV type 2.

Representative results for Alinity m EBV linearity performance for type 2 and for type 1 (Section 5.7.1.4) are shown in Figure 3.

Alinity m EBV was demonstrated to be linear across the quantitation range for EBV type 1 and type 2 from $5 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to 200,000,000 IU/mL (1.70 Log IU/mL to 8.30 Log IU/mL).

# 5.7.1.6 Precision

Precision of Alinity m EBV was determined by analyzing a 9-member plasma panel. Panel members with concentrations targeted to 1.30 Log IU/mL and 2.00 Log IU/mL $( 2 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ and $1 0 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ ) were prepared with positive clinical sample, panel members targeted in the range of 2.70 Log IU/mL to 5.00 Log IU/mL (500 IU/mL to $1 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ ) were prepared using cultured virus, and panel members with targeted concentrations greater than $5 . 0 0 \mathrm { L o g } \mathrm { I U / m L }$ were prepared using synthetic DNA. Each panel member was tested in 4 replicates, twice each day for 12 days, on 3 Alinity m Systems operated by 3 operators (1 operator per instrument), using 3 AMP kit lots (1 lot per instrument), for a total of 288 replicates per panel member.

The representative precision study results in Table 7 and Table 8 demonstrated that Alinity m EBV within-laboratory standard deviation (SD) was less than or equal to 0.25 Log IU/mL for EBV DNA panels targeted in the range of $2 . 7 0 \mathrm { L o g } \mathrm { I U } / \mathrm { m L }$ to 8.30 Log IU/mL ( $\mathrm { 5 0 0 \Pi U / m L }$ to $2 0 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ ), and less than or equal to 0.50 Log IU/mL for EBV DNA panels targeted in the range of 1.30 Log IU/mL to less than 2.70 Log IU/mL ( $2 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to less than $5 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ ).

# 5.7.1.7 Lower Limit of Quantitation

The lower limit of quantitation (LLoQ) is defined as the lowest concentration at which EBV DNA is reliably quantitated within an acceptable total error. Total error was estimated for detected samples from the LoD study by 2 methods:

• Total Analytical Error $( \mathrm { T A E } ) = | \mathbf { b i a s } | + 2 \times \mathrm { S D }$ , and • Total Error $( \mathrm { T E } ) = \mathrm { S Q R T } ( 2 ) \times 2 \times \mathrm { S D } .$

The results of the calculations are shown in Table 9.

Panel members were dilutions of the $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard for Epstein Barr Virus for Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques (NIBSC code: 09/260) prepared in EBV negative plasma.

The results of these analyses support a claimed LLoQ of 50.00 IU/mL (1.70 Log IU/mL) for Alinity m EBV, with an acceptable level of accuracy and precision, ie, TAE and TE less than or equal to $1 . 0 0 \mathrm { L o g } \mathrm { I U } / \mathrm { m L }$ .

# 5.7.1.8 Analytical Specificity – Potential Cross-Reactants

The analytical specificity of Alinity m EBV was evaluated with a panel of microorganisms (see Table 10) in EBV negative plasma, positive plasma targeted to $6 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ EBV DNA, and positive plasma targeted to $1 0 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ EBV DNA. Microorganisms were tested at a final concentration of $1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { U n i t s / m L }$ for viruses and fungi or $1 0 ^ { 6 }$ Units/mL for bacteria.

# 5.7.1.9 Analytical Specificity - Potentially Interfering Substances

The effects of endogenous substances and the presence of high levels of therapeutic drugs commonly prescribed in transplant patients were evaluated. Potential interference on Alinity m EBV performance in plasma was assessed by testing 8 negative samples, 8 positive samples targeted to $6 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ and 8 positive samples targeted to $1 0 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ EBV DNA.

No interference was observed in the presence of albumin $( 6 0 ~ \mathrm { g / L } )$ , hemoglobin $( 1 0 \ \mathrm { g / L } )$ , triglycerides ( $1 6 . 9 4 \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ , conjugated bilirubin $( 4 7 5 \mathrm { \mu m o l / L } )$ ), unconjugated bilirubin $( 6 8 4 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } )$ , or human genomic DNA $2 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ ) that were introduced in the sample.

No interference was observed in the presence of drug compounds tested in pools or individually that are listed in Table 11, at a concentration of 3 times the reported $\mathrm { { C } _ { \mathrm { { m a x } } } }$ or higher.

# 5.7.1.10 Carryover

The carryover rate for Alinity m EBV was determined by analyzing 648 valid replicates of EBV negative samples processed from alternating positions with 647 valid replicates of high concentrated EBV positive samples greater than or equal to $2 0 { , } 0 0 0 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { I U / m L } .$ , across a minimum of 27 runs. The carryover resulting in a detectable concentration greater than or equal to LoD was $0 . 3 \%$ ( $9 5 \%$ CI: $0 . 1 \%$ to $1 . 1 \%$ ). The carryover resulting in EBV detection was $1 . 2 \%$ ( $9 5 \%$ CI: $0 . 6 \%$ to $2 . 4 \%$ ).

# 5.7.1.11 Alinity m EBV Testing Using Dilution Procedure

The 1:2.5 dilution procedure was evaluated by comparing quantitation of neat samples and samples tested using the Alinity m EBV dilution procedure. Five plasma panel members with EBV levels targeted in the range of $1 5 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to 100,000,000 IU/mL (2.18 Log IU/mL to 8.00 Log IU/mL) were tested. Each panel member was tested, neat or using the dilution procedures, in multiple replicates. For the 5 panel members, the differences in mean, ie, diluted minus neat, ranged from $- 0 . 0 1$ Log IU/mL to 0.23 Log IU/mL.

# 5.7.1.12 Precision of Alinity m EBV Using Dilution Procedure

Precision of Alinity m EBV, using the dilution procedure, was determined by analyzing 3 plasma panel members. Panel members 1 and 2 were prepared by spiking cultured virus in EBV negative sample, and panel member 3 was prepared by spiking synthetic DNA in EBV negative sample. Each panel member was tested in at least 3 replicates, twice each day for 12 days, on 3 Alinity m Systems with 3 Alinity m Specimen Dilution Kit I lots and 3 Alinity m EBV AMP Kit lots by 3 operators (1 Specimen Diluent lot, 1 AMP kit lot and 1 operator per instrument), for a total of at least 216 replicates.

The results, representative of the precision of Alinity m EBV using dilution procedures, are summarized in Table 12 and Table 13.

# 5.7.1.13 Confirmation of the LLoQ Using Dilution Procedure

Confirmation testing for Alinity m EBV LLoQ using the dilution procedure was performed by testing 2 panel members at $5 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ (LLoQ) and $6 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ (near LLoQ) with a dilution factor of 1:2.5. The EBV concentrations in the panel members were targeted at $2 0 ~ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ and $2 4 ~ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ (1.30 Log IU/mL and 1.38 Log $\mathrm { I U / m L }$ ) after dilution in Specimen Diluent. Panel members were dilutions of cultured virus spiked into EBV negative plasma.

A minimum of 14 replicates per day of each panel level were tested using the dilution procedure in 3 runs across 3 days (one run per day). The study was performed using 1 Alinity m EBV AMP Kit lot, 1 Specimen Diluent lot, and 1 Alinity m System. Total error was estimated by TAE and TE, as shown in Table 14. The accuracy and precision at $2 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ and $2 4 ~ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ were confirmed for Alinity m EBV testing using the 1:2.5 dilution procedure.

# 5.7.2 Clinical Reproducibility

Reproducibility performance of Alinity m EBV was evaluated by testing a 9-member reproducibility panel, including 8 positive panel members and 1 negative panel member. The positive panel members were prepared using an EBV positive clinical specimen, cultured virus, or plasmid DNA diluted in human EDTA plasma. The concentration levels targeted for the reproducibility panels spanned the quantitation range of the assay. A total of 3 Alinity m EBV AMP Kit lots, 3 Alinity m EBV CAL Kit lots, 3 Alinity m EBV CTRL Kit lots and 3 Alinity m Sample Prep Kit 2 lots were used. Three clinical sites each tested 2 unique reagent lot combinations (consisting of 2 Alinity m EBV AMP Kit lots along with 1 lot of each Alinity m EBV CAL Kit, Alinity m EBV CTRL Kit and Alinity m Sample Prep Kit 2) on 5 non-consecutive days for each lot combination. Six replicates of each panel member were tested on each of 5 days to ensure a minimum of 5 valid replicates for analysis. The reproducibility results are summarized in Table 15 and Table 16 (for the positive panel members) and Table 17 (for the negative panel member).

# 5.7.3 Clinical Performance

Alinity m EBV results were compared to those of an FDA-cleared EBV nucleic acid test in a representative study. A total of 558 EDTA plasma samples were tested (neat or diluted), including 542 clinical specimens from hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and solid organ transplant (SOT) subjects, and 16 contrived samples prepared by spiking inactivated EBV virus into the individual clinical specimens. The Alinity m EBV assay testing was performed at 3 clinical testing sites with 3 Alinity m EBV reagent kit lots.

Of the 558 clinical samples, 550 produced valid results with Alinity m EBV and the comparator assay, including 388 samples detected by Alinity m EBV and 162 samples not detected by Alinity m EBV. Out of 550 valid samples, 168 were from HSCT subjects, 379 were from SOT subjects, and 3 were from dual-transplant (HSCT/SOT) subjects. The agreement between Alinity m EBV and comparator results is shown in Table 18 (HSCT samples), Table 19 (SOT samples), and Table 20 (HSCT and SOT samples combined).

a The LLoQ used here is the higher LLoQ between Alinity m EBV and comparator.

Discordant results were defined as those that are more than one box away from the diagonal (indicated by shading). For Target Not Detected (TND) by Comparator Column Agreement, the Alinity m EBV Target Not Detected and $<$ LLoQ cells were combined. The rationale for adding the adjacent <LLoQ and TND cells for the TND column was that the difference between a TND and <LLoQ were not clinically meaningful and that these were analytically at the lower end of the quantitation range, which may be impacted by random error.

Of the 550 samples, 44 were collected for the estimation of Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) and were confirmed as EBV DNA negative. For this subset of confirmed EBV DNA negative clinical specimens, the NPA with the Comparator assay was $1 0 0 . 0 \%$ (44/44) with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $( 9 2 . 0 \%$ , $1 0 0 . 0 \%$ ).

Agreement between Alinity m EBV assay and the comparator assay was also evaluated using different clinical thresholds and is shown in Table 21 (HSCT samples), Table 22 (SOT samples), and Table 23 (HSCT and SOT samples combined).

Regression and bias analysis included a total of 239 samples with results that were within the common quantitation range of both Alinity m EBV and the comparator assay. Figure 4 shows the results of the Deming regression analysis with a slope of 1.01, intercept of 0.05, and correlation coefficient of 0.974. The mean bias between Alinity m EBV and the comparator (Alinity m EBV minus comparator) was 0.09 Log IU/mL with a $9 5 \%$ CI of (0.06, 0.12).
