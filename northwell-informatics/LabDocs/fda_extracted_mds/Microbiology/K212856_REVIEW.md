The iClear VTM-RT kit functions as a general transport medium kit for collecting and transporting clinical specimens. This transport medium is used to safely collect and transport viruses, Chlamydiae, or Mycoplasma hominis from collection sites to the testing laboratories. It is intended for use by Health Care Professionals, the transport system allows for the collection of the specimen via the sterile swab, maintenance through a buffered media, prevention of microbial growth via antimicrobial agents, as well as a $\mathsf { p H }$ indicator. The media has been validated with culture recovery of virus. The sterile swab provided in the kit is packaged in peeled pouch for specimen collection. The cap from the vial is intended to be removed aseptically, and the sample collection swab is inserted into the vial containing the iClean VTM

RT Medium. After the collected sample is placed into the transport media, it is transported to the laboratory. The media can be maintained at room temperature but for optimal performance the specimen should be refrigerated at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ while in transit.

# B Principle of Operation:

The neutral environment $( 7 . 0 { \sim } 7 . 8 )$ provided by Hank’s buffer aids in the stability of the viruses. Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) acts as a protein stabilizer, forming a protective film on the protein shell of the virus, making it less likely to break down and ensuring the integrity of the virus. Gentamicin sulfate, amphotericin B, and colistin inhibit growth of bacteria or yeast. Lglutamic acid serves as an auxiliary energy source to keep cell and virus stability. HEPES buffer provides additional help to maintain a stable $\mathsf { p H }$ value environment thus increases the stability of virus. Phenol red is a $\mathsf { p H }$ indicator which serves as a visual quality control mechanism. The medium is isotonic and non-toxic to mammalian host cells.

# Shelf Life:

The shelf life for the iClean VTM-RT kit was determined to be 12 months from the date of manufacture when stored in a clean, dry, ventilated environment at $2 0 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The shelf life of the iClean VTM-RT kit was established using real-time aging performance test at time points $\mathrm { T } = 0$ , 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. At each time point, appearance, volume, $\mathsf { p H }$ , antibiotic stability, and recovery study were assessed.

a. Appearance Inspection:

To evaluate appearance stability, three lots of iClean VTM were physically or visually examined for real-time aging at timepoints $\mathrm { T } = 0$ , 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. The media was stored in a clean, dry, ventilated environment at $2 0 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . At each time point, appearance of the product was inspected visually to be clear (i. e. no turbidity, no cloudy nor precipitation) and maintains a pink color (i. e. no color change from pink to yellow). Media volume was assessed to ensure each tube was filled to $3 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ . All results were acceptable and support the claim that the VTM-RT kit is physically or visually stable for 12 months.

# b. pH Stability

The pH of the media was used as one of the indicators to support product stability. The media was tested at time points $\mathrm { T } = 0$ , 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the manufacturing date. Three lots of VTM-RT media were stored in a clean, dry, ventilated environment under the recommended temperature conditions $( 2 0 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and at the specified time intervals, 15 tubes from each of the three lots were removed from storage. The media inside each of the vials was evaluated using a calibrated $\mathsf { p H }$ meter. For all the tubes at each time point for each of the three lots, the $\mathsf { p H }$ was within the predefined $\mathsf { p H }$ range of $7 . 4 \pm 0 . 4$ .

# c. Antibiotic Stability:

iClean VTM-RT contains gentamicin sulfate, amphotericin B, and colistin to inhibit growth of bacteria or yeast. Stability of these antibiotics was evaluated through inoculating $5 . 0 \textrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 5 } - 4 . 5 \textrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m I }$ L of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Escherichia coli ATCC 8099, and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 into iClean VTM media followed by appropriate storage and incubation. The inoculated media was tested immediately or stored in VTM for 24 hrs. and 48 hrs. Spiked media was transferred by pipetting $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ onto nutrient agar plates for $S .$ aureus and $E$ . coli and Sabouraud media for $C .$ . albicans. All plates evaluated at time $\mathrm { T } = 0$ had $9 . 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ cfu/mL growth or greater while plates evaluated at 24 and 48 hrs. all had no growth.

# d. Sterilization:

The iClean VTM kit is not claimed to be sterile nor is it intended to be sterilized by the end user. To decrease the chances of contamination the media uses specific manufacturing steps including sterilization of tubes and packaging by gamma radiation set at a dose of 5.3 Kilo Gray (KGy), in accordance with ISO 11137-2:2015. The media is filtered using a $0 . 2 2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ sterile fiber membrane and then is aseptically filled into the pre-sterilized tubes. The aseptic status of the filtered iClean VTM-RT was then validated by a quality control process which evaluates the absence of growth of bacteria and fungi by spreading $0 . 1 \mathrm { m L }$ of the filtered VTM-RT medium on nutrient agar and Sabouraud media plates and incubated at $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 24 – 48 hours. No growth on any of the plates tested was observed.

The results collectively for appearance, volume, $\mathsf { p H }$ , antibiotic stability support the 12- month stability claim for the iClean VTM-RT kit.

# Performance Testing - Recovery Studies:

Performance of the iClean VTM was evaluated by Culture-Based Recovery Studies for viral and bacterial test strains. For Viral Recovery Studies, Fluorescent Foci Count method was utilized to evaluate the recovery of Influenza A (ATCC VR-544), Parainfluenza 3 (ATCC VR-93) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (ATCC VR-1401). This method was also utilized to evaluate the recovery of Chlamydia pneumoniae (ATCC VR-53592) and C. trachomatis (ATCC VR-880). For Bacterial Recovery Studies, Roll-Plate and Swab Elution Methods were utilized to evaluate the recovery of Mycoplasma hominis (ATCC VR-14027). Performance testing included nine lots of media. Each performance study summarized below used media lots that represents “New” for newly manufactured media, “Mid” for middle aged media ${ \sim } 5$ months old) and “Old” for older media about to expire or recently expired media.

# Viral and Chlamydial Recovery Studies:

Virus stocks were diluted in pooled negative clinical matrix and each chosen dilution was inoculated into swab and placed into iClean VTM to store at $4 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 0, 24 and 48 hours respectively. For tissue culture, Hep-2 cells (ATCC CCL-23) or McCoy cells (ATCC CRL-1696) were grown to $9 5 \%$ confluency. When tissue culture plates were ready, $2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ of each test samples were used to infect the monolayers and incubated. For detection, specific immunofluorescent antibody staining was used. The number of infectious particles were counted as Fluorescent Foci and calculated for each storage temperature and time points. McCoy cell cultures were used for the recovery of Chlamydia pneumoniae (ATCC VR53592) and $C .$ . trachomatis (ATCC VR-880). The results are presented in the Table 1 and Table 2 below. Any reduction in the foci count for the timepoints (0 to $4 8 { \mathrm { h r } }$ .) was shown as percent decline.

# Bacterial Recovery Studies:

Performance of iClean VTM for bacterial recovery was determined using roll plate swab elution methods. Both the roll plate and swab elution studies follow the FDA recognized sections of CLSI M40-A2:2014 Quality Control of Microbiological Transport Systems; Approved Standard – Second Edition.

# Roll-plate method:

For the roll-plate method, Mycoplasma hominis suspensions were prepared to approximately 0.5 McFarland standard $( 1 . 5 \times \bar { 1 0 ^ { 8 } } \mathrm { C F U / m L } )$ ) in $0 . 8 5 \%$ physiological saline followed by 10- fold serial dilutions in pooled negative matrix. Swabs in triplicate were spiked with $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of each dilution and placed in the iClean VTM and maintained under refrigerated or at room temperature. After 0, 24 and 48 hours, the swabs were removed and rolled directly onto agar plates which were incubated to grow colonies. Average CFU/roll-plate calculated for each timepoints were presented in Table 3 and Table 4. According to CLSI M40 A2 guidelines, the inoculum dilutions yielding time-zero plates with closely approaching 300 CFU was used to complete the viability studies. The acceptance criteria were set to a recovery of $\geq 1 0$ CFU following the specified maintenance time at the iClean VTM.

# Swab Elution Method:

For the swab elution method, the Mycoplasma hominis inocula were prepared in a manner similar to that for the roll-plate method. The initial bacterial suspensions were diluted by $1 0 ^ { - 4 }$ and dispensed $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ onto swabs in triplicate. The swabs were then placed in the iClean VTM and maintained under refrigerated or at room temperature for the specified timepoints. After 0, 24, and 48 hours the swabs were removed, and 10-fold serial dilutions were prepared. From each of the dilution, $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ was dispensed onto the agar plate and incubated to allow the growth of colonies. The results calculated in average CFU/mL for the specified time points are presented in Table 5 and 6. According to CLSI document M40-A2, the acceptance criteria for viability in the swab elution method was considered to be no more than a $3 \log _ { 1 0 }$ change in CFU count between the zero-time and the 48 hours – time points.
