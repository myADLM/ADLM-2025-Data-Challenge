Special Conditions for Use Statement: For prescription use

Special Instrument Requirements: Integrated into the BD Kiestra™ Laboratory Automation Solution

# Device Description

The BD Kiestra™ Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Application will be optional for the BD Kiestra™ Laboratory Automation Solution and will support laboratory technologists in batching no growth on the BD BBL™ CHROMagar™ MRSA II, growth with no key colony color detected for MRSA (“Growth – other”), and growth with key colony color detected for MRSA (“Growth MRSA Mauve”). These classifications will be characterized as “no growth”, “growth” and “growth with mauve color” from BD BBL™ CHROMagar™ MRSA II media, from anterior nares samples.

The technologist has the ability to create work lists in BD Synapsys™ informatics solution based on the classifications (growth, no growth or growth with mauve color). These work lists will be used for followup work and batching of results, at the sample level.

The BD Kiestra™ Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Application will apply Image Algorithms to the digital images to determine if the plate contains “growth” or “no growth”. At the individual plate level when the Image Algorithms detects colony growth and potential mauve color the classification will be “growth with mauve color”.

When the BD Kiestra™ Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Application is not capable of automatically generating the outputs (visual attributes: growth with or without mauve color/no

growth), the laboratory technologist will be required to read the digital image of the plate on the computer screen and decide on follow-up action as is the current standard laboratory practice.

# Test Principle

The BD Kiestra™ Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Application will be used by trained laboratory technologists. Anterior nares specimens will be inoculated manually or automated by use of the BD Kiestra™ InoqulA $+ \mathbf { T M }$ or the BD Kiestra™ InoqulA, which are part of the BD Kiestra™ Laboratory Automation Solution, onto BD BBL™ CHROMagar™ MRSA II plates.

The BD Kiestra™ InoqulA $+ \mathbf { T M }$ or BD Kiestra™ InoqulA system inoculates and streaks the specimen onto the BD BBL™ CHROMagar™ MRSA II plates. The plates are automatically transferred to the BD Kiestra™ ReadA™ Compact or BD Kiestra™ ReadA where they are incubated at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ in $\mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ .

Following a short incubation period (typically 1.5 - 3.5 hours), the plate is imaged by the camera onboard the BD Kiestra™ ReadA™ Compact or BD Kiestra™ ReadA, to obtain a baseline image when no significant bacterial growth can be observed. By the 1.5 - 3.5 hours incubation time point, the plate temperature has reached the incubator temperature and condensation under the plate has dissipated, enabling a clear image of the media to serve as the reference image (T0). This T0 image is used as the baseline comparison for all subsequent images taken to ensure artifacts in the image are not considered growth and to evaluate differential contrast from growing colonies. At all timepoints, in order to maximize colony contrast to their background, the images include illumination from the top, side and bottom of the plate using black (top and side illumination) or white (bottom illumination) contrasting background.

The camera resides on the BD Kiestra™ ReadA™ Compact/BD Kiestra™ ReadA. When an image is scheduled to be taken, the plate is moved to the camera and a digital image is captured. The plate is immediately returned to its designated place, so the plate never leaves the BD Kiestra™ ReadA™ Compact/BD Kiestra™ ReadA. The plate is aligned each time an image is taken by utilizing the plate barcode for the alignment.

The camera produces raw data, pixel values, which are processed by the Optis Image Software resident on the BD Kiestra™ ReadA™ Compact/BD Kiestra™ ReadA. The BD Kiestra™ ReadA™ Compact/BD Kiestra™ ReadA software handles only the mechanical movements within the BD Kiestra™ ReadA™ Compact/BD Kiestra™ ReadA and interacts with the Image Software. The Image Software analyzes the plate pixel values to determine the optimal image acquisition sequence maximizing the signal to noise ratio and dynamic range. The image is further processed and corrections for chromatic aberrations and geometrical distortions are applied, which creates a high quality and normalized image.

Aside from the T0 baseline image time point (1.5 - 3.5 hours) and intermediate time point (10 - 14 hours), the imaging times are also set for at least one endpoint reading of 20 - 26 hours. Users can configure other time points in the BD Kiestra™ database manager, at the time of installation. Final incubation time is configured by the user based on the plated media formulation and the user’s standard operation procedures. The BD Kiestra™ Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Application compares each image to the corresponding baseline image for comparison for new growth and to rule out artifacts in the media such as dust or air bubbles, see Figure 1.

![](images/6d9a57d85ab6c5badbb344d7b48bfb1bd185e9a451c3a552c3d8f1d18ba67239.jpg)

The time series images are collected for each plate to allow for growth vs no growth determination and the presence of mauve colored growth by the BD Kiestra™ Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Application.

Based on these results, growth vs no growth and mauve, the images can be sorted in order to streamline and optimize the reading workflow. Plates with no growth can be grouped in a batch list where the user can screen the proposed no growth results in a batch and report with one click. Images that show growth without any trace of mauve can be shown in a different list for single or batch evaluation, and the samples that show the presence of the mauve color will be shown in a separate list for review and further work up so that the user can prioritize those cases.

Patient demographics that are provided via the Laboratory Information System (LIS) can be used to further sort the results, through the user of user-defined expert rules.

The BD Kiestra™ Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Application supports all features including reporting to the LIS by way of BD Synapsys™ informatics solution.

# Analytical Performance

# Digital Quality Image Study

An internal digital image quality study was performed using simulated surveillance samples including MRSA, non-MRSA, and saline controls to show equivalency between a microbiologist interpreting a digital image and interpreting a plate manually (direct in hand).

Samples were plated on BD BBL™ CHROMagar™ MRSAII agar, incubated, and imaged using the BD Kiestra™ Laboratory Automation Solution. Digital images of the plates were acquired using the BD Kiestra™ ReadA Compact with 5 MP camera. Following image collection, three trained clinical microbiologists evaluated plates manually and from the digital image. Samples were randomized and readers did not have access to the direct plate when reading digital images. Results were categorized as mauve growth, non-mauve growth, or no growth. Manual plate results were compared to the digital image results to calculate overall percent agreement. Further stratification is provided by microbiologist.

# Digital Image Reproducibility

Results from the internal digital image quality study (Table 6 – 10) were used to evaluate reproducibility among a panel of microbiologists for the digital image read. Analysis was performed by comparing the microbiologist’s interpretation to the final digital image result (determined by 2/3 majority microbiologist result) to calculate percent agreement.

# Reproducibility

An internal reproducibility study was conducted with seeded samples representing MRSA positive (mauve) and MRSA negative (non-mauve) isolates. Seeded samples were created with saline using $1 8 -$ 24-hour bacterial strains on TSAII obtained from clinical and $\mathsf { A T C C } ^ { \otimes }$ strains. The Reproducibility Study was conducted at two internal sites at the BD Sparks, MD location with two different automated systems. A panel of 7 simulated clinical nares samples (5 mauve and 2 non-mauve) as well as saline control samples (expected no growth) were evaluated including the following:

# Average Mauve CFU Diameter When First Detected

To determine the average CFU diameter of a mauve colony when first detected, an unlocked version of the application (Not available for commercial use) was used to process digital images of plates with MRSA isolates in 1-hour increments starting at hour 2 and ending at hour 22. These images were then evaluated by 3 microbiologists to measure the diameter of the mauve colonies at first detection by the application. A total of 857 CFUs were evaluated throughout the full 22-hour incubation time.

Testing included:

3 MRSA isolates $\times 5$ replicates per dilution $\times 2$ dilutions   
1 media type (BD BBL™ CHROMagar™ MRSAII media) evaluated total of 30 plates evaluated using images collected every hour from 2–22 hours of incubation (30 plates $\times 2 1$ images per plate $=$ approximately 630 images)

The following table shows the average mauve CFU diameter when first detected:

# Clinical Performance Studies

Approximately 1,800 clinical anterior nares specimens were plated, incubated, and imaged on the BD Kiestra™ Laboratory Automation Solution at three clinical sites. To establish performance of the MRSA app, the images were manually read by trained microbiologists at those sites for the following requirements:

“No growth” • “Growth - other” (growth without mauve color) • “Growth MRSA Mauve”

Clinical anterior nares specimens were plated and incubated in air $( \mathbf { O } _ { 2 } )$ for 24 hours on BD BBL™ CHROMagar™ MRSA II media. The Percent Agreement for each interpretation are listed in the following table:
