# II Submission/Device Overview:

# A Purpose for Submission:

To obtain a substantial equivalence determination for the BD Kiestra Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Application (BD Kiestra MRSA App)

# B Measurand:

Digital images of colonies cultured on BD BBL CHROMagar MRSA II culture plates to determine presence or absence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)

# C Type of Test:

The BD Kiestra MRSA Application is an in vitro diagnostic software program that provides a qualitative assessment of microbial growth on BD BBL CHROMagar MRSA II culture plates inoculated with anterior specimens to aid in the prevention and control of MRSA infection.

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The BD Kiestra Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Application is an in-vitro diagnostic software program that requires the BD Kiestra Laboratory Automation Solution in order to operate.

The BD Kiestra Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Application is applied to digital images of BD BBL CHROMagar MRSA II culture plates inoculated with anterior nares samples.

Algorithms are applied to digital images to provide a qualitative assessment of colony growth and colorimetric detection of target colonies to screen for nasal colonization by MRSA, and to serve as an aid in the prevention and control of MRSA infection. Applied algorithms provide the following results:

" No growth", which will be manually released individually or as a batch (with other no growth samples) by a trained microbiologist upon review of the digital plate images.   
• "Growth - other" (growth without mauve color), which digital plate images will be manually reviewed by a trained microbiologist.   
• "Growth MRSA Mauve" (growth with mauve color), which digital plate images will be manually reviewed by a trained microbiologist.

The assay is not intended to guide, diagnose, or monitor treatment for MRSA infections. It is not intended to provide results of susceptibility to oxacillin/methicillin.

The BD Kiestra Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Application is indicated for use in the clinical laboratory.

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Rx - For Prescription Use Only

D Special Instrument Requirements: BD Kiestra ReadA or BD Kiestra ReadA Compact which is part of the BD Kiestra Laboratory Automation Solution

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The BD Kiestra Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Application (herein referred to as the BD MRSA App) is an optional in vitro diagnostic software application for the BD Kiestra Laboratory Automation Solution (described for the BD Kiestra IdentifA, K191964). The BD MRSA App analyzes images of BD BBL CHROMagar MRSA II plates inoculated with anterior nares swab specimens from patients to screen for MRSA colonization. Images are generated with the BD Kiestra ReadA or the BD Kiestra ReadA Compact using BD Kiestra Optis technology. The BD MRSA App provides a qualitative assessment of colony growth and color as it pertains to MRSA growth as: no growth, growth without mauve color, or growth with mauve color.

# B Principle of Operation:

Anterior nares specimens are inoculated manually or automatically by the BD Kiestra InoqulA $^ +$ or BD Kiestra InoqulA, which is part of the BD Kiestra Laboratory Automation Solution, onto BD BBL CHROMagar MRSA II plates. Plates are then transferred to the BD Kiestra ReadA or the BD Kiestra ReadA Compact for incubation at $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and image acquisition by the onboard camera at specific timepoints. Each plate is imaged at least three times to provide a time series for the algorithm to evaluate: an initial image to evaluate the appearance of the plate prior to the presence of observable bacterial growth, an intermediate image halfway through the incubation cycle, and a final image taken at the end of the evaluation time. The algorithm determines what has grown on the plate between the first and final image. The final interpretation of all digital images, regardless of the BD MRSA App interpretation, will be made by the microbiologist.

The system uses three different light sources (top, bottom and side) and has two different backgrounds (black and white). At the timepoint the plate is imaged, multiple acquisitions are done by the camera with each light source and background to get an optimal image and to enhance the signal to noise ratio. The ReadA instrument creates a single high contrast image from the multiple acquisitions. The same image is used for both the BD MRSA App and the digital image displayed for user review.

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility:

# Reproducibility

The reproducibility of the BD MRSA App within runs, between runs, and between instruments was evaluated at two internal sites. A panel of seven simulated clinical nares samples, comprised of 5 MRSA strains and 2 non-MRSA strains (Table 1), were streaked in triplicate on BD BBL CHROMagar MRSA II plates at three dilutions $( 1 0 ^ { 2 } , 1 0 ^ { 3 } , 1 - 5 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 4 }$

$\mathrm { C F U / m L }$ ), as well as a saline control, using the InoqulA $^ +$ inoculation method. Plates were incubated at $3 5 \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , then imaged and analyzed in 5 replicates after 22 hours using the BD Kiestra ReadA Compact 5MP camera, per the instructions for use, on 3 days (2 sites x 3 replicates x 5 images x 3 days $= 9 0$ images/dilution). Data in which the expected result was not obtained after manual review were excluded from analysis.

The results of the reproducibility study are summarized in Table 2. The BD MRSA app was able to detect all plates with MRSA growth but was unable to detect growth for one replicate of a non-MRSA strain (code 3441). This is acceptable since all digital images are reviewed by a microbiologist and there is a low risk associated with not detecting a non-MRSA strain. Overall, reproducibility was determined to be acceptable.

# Digital Image Quality

A Digital Image Quality study was performed to evaluate the accuracy of microbiologists’ interpretation of a digital image generated by the BD MRSA App (i.e., technologist examining the digital image on the computer screen; “digital image read”) compared to the interpretation of the same agar plate manually (i.e., technologist examining the physical plate; “manual plate read”). Two hundred contrived samples (described below) were prepared from 25 unique isolates for evaluation. Contrived samples were diluted at $1 0 ^ { 2 } - 1 0 ^ { 3 }$ $\mathrm { C F U / m L }$ , $1 0 ^ { 3 } - 1 0 ^ { 4 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ , $1 0 ^ { 4 } - 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ CFU/mL, ${ > } 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ and inoculated onto BD BBL CHROMagar MRSA II agar plates using the InoqulA $^ +$ inoculation method. A panel of three microbiologists blindly interpreted all agar plates and the corresponding digital images.

A total of 85 expected “mauve” samples were prepared (61 pure cultures of MRSA strains, 3 mixed cultures with two different MRSA strains, and 21 mixed cultures of MRSA and nonMRSA strains). A total of 115 expected “no growth” or expected “non-mauve growth” samples were prepared (82 pure cultures of non-MRSA strains, 18 mixed cultures of nonMRSA strains, and 15 saline samples). Non-MRSA strains were organisms that were either expected to grow as non-mauve colonies (“non-mauve growth”) or expected to have growth inhibited (“no growth”) on the CHROMagar plates. The non-MRSA strains included isolates from the following species: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Staphylococcus pettenkoferi, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus.

The data generated in this study were analyzed in two different ways: microbiologists digital image read compared to the manual plate read (Table 3 – Table 6) and reproducibility of microbiologists’ interpretation of a digital image read (Table 7).

a) Microbiologists digital image read compared to manual plate read The purpose of this study was to assess whether a microbiologist’s digital image read is equivalent to their manual plate read. A summary of the combined results is provided in Table 3 as well as stratified by each microbiologist in Table 4, Table 5 and Table 6. Results in which the microbiologist’s digital image read and manual plate read were inconsistent with the expected result were excluded from analysis as they were considered a technical error.

The digital image quality study determined that an BD MRSA App-generated digital image can be equivalently interpreted by a microbiologist compared to reading the plate manually. This was achieved $59 8 \%$ of the time for both the non-mauve growth and mauve growth designations, which is acceptable. Although agreement for the no growth designation was $- 9 5 \%$ , this is considered acceptable since the BD MRSA App is designed to maximize sensitivity which may result in over-calling of growth.

b) Reproducibility of the BD MRSA App-generated digital image interpretation The data obtained from the digital image quality study was further analyzed to evaluate the ability of an BD MRSA App-generated digital image to be reproducibly interpreted by a panel of microbiologists. Here, each microbiologist’s interpretation of a digital image was compared to the final panel interpretation of the digital image (i.e., majority result). The study determined that a digital image generated with the BD MRSA App can be reproducibly interpreted by a microbiologist. This was achieved $59 8 \%$ of the time for each of the three result designations (summarized in Table 7), which is acceptable.

1 Three results were excluded from the reproducibility analysis since results from at least one microbiologist was determined to be invalid. 2 Percent agreement determined by dividing number of individual microbiologist digital image read results by the number of microbiologist panel digital image read results for each designation (i.e., “no growth”, “non-mauve growth”, “mauve growth”).

Camera $( 5 M P \nu s 2 5 M P )$ and Inoculation (InoqulA $^ +$ automated vs manual) Equivalency An equivalency study was performed to determine whether: (1) the InoqulA $^ +$ automated and manual streaking methods can be equivalently interpreted by the BD Kiestra MRSA App and (2) the BD Kiestra ReadA Compact camera subsystems (5MP and 25MP) can generate equivalent images for evaluation by the BD Kiestra MRSA App. A total of 399 samples, including 200 clinical anterior nares specimens and 199 seeded samples prepared in saline (71 MRSA, 28 non-MRSA, 100 uninoculated), were inoculated onto BD BBL CHROMagar MRSA II media plates, in nine replicates, for multiple variable evaluations (i.e., 5MP camera vs 25MP camera; automated (InoqulA+) vs manual $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ vs manual $3 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ inoculation. Since plate incubation, imaging and processing are done in one instrument, a single plate cannot be imaged by both a 5MP and a 25MP camera. Therefore, two plates were prepared from the same seeded sample for imagining of the plate in incubators with either camera. Images were acquired at 2, 12 and 24 hours using the 5MP or 25MP camera. A total of ${ \sim } 3 6 0 0$ images were analyzed by the BD Kiestra MRSA App (399 samples $_ { \textrm { X 9 } }$ replicates $=$ 3591 total images/timepoint).

The equivalency data are summarized in Table 8 for growth and Table 9 for color, each stratified by sample type (clinical, saline, seeded). Agreement was determined by comparing the MRSA App generated result with a microbiologist interpretation of the digital image. Although variation among inoculation methods and camera subsystems was observed, each variable was determined to be acceptable since MRSA App detection of mauve color was $59 5 \%$ for each variable and all digital images are reviewed by a microbiologist.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods): Calibration of the BD Kiestra ReadA Compact camera is described with the BD Kiestra IdentifA, K191964. When alerted, occasional calibration of the camera is required as well as after cleaning using BD provided calibration plates. In addition, biological quality control testing must be performed according to the BD BBL CHROMagar MRSA II media package insert instructions.

In lieu of a limit of detection study to identify the smallest colony size (diameter) that can reproducibility be detected as a mauve colony by the BD MRSA App, a study was performed to determine the average colony size (diameter) when first detected as mauve by the BD MRSA App. Three MRSA strains (see Table 1) were diluted into saline (final concentrations of $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 3 }$ and $1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ ) and plated onto BD BBL CHROMagar MRSA II media with the InoquA $^ +$ in 5 replicates (3 MRSA isolates $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ dilutions x 5 replicates $= 3 0$ total plates imaged). To allow such testing, an unlocked, non-commercially available functionality in the BD MRSA App was used to process digital images of plates with MRSA isolates in 1-hour increments. After two hours of incubation, image acquisition occurred every hour with the last image time point set as 22 hours. The BD MRSA App as well as a panel of three microbiologists evaluated the digital images at each timepoint and reported the colony diameter when a mauve colony was first detected.

A total of 857 mauve colonies were evaluated amongst the three MRSA strains. The average colony diameter for each strain is summarized in Table 10.

The clinical performance of the BD Kiestra MRSA App was evaluated at three testing sites (2 US and 1 outside US). Remnant anterior nares specimens that were leftover from standard of care for surveillance screening were processed per the BD Kiestra MRSA App instructions for use and evaluated for plate growth and color after 24 hours of growth with the BD Kiestra ReadA Compact. After the plates were imaged, two trained and proficient operators evaluated the digital image for plate growth and color to be compared with the BD Kiestra MRSA App result. A third operator (arbiter) performed an additional, blinded evaluation if the results between the two operators did not agree. If all three operators provided different results, the readings were considered “non-compliant”. A total of 1775 images were evaluated; 1609 images were compliant. An additional 16 images were excluded from analysis due to mixed purity growth that could not be interpreted for color. Results for the remaining 1593 images are summarized in Table 11. The overall agreement of the BD

Kiestra MRSA App is $7 6 . 6 \%$ for “no growth”, $8 4 . 5 \%$ for “non-mauve growth”, and $9 8 . 2 \%$ for “mauve growth” detection. These performance results are acceptable since all digital plate images will be reviewed by a trained microbiologist.
