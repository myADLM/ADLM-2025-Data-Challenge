C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Rx - For Prescription Use Only

# D Special Instrument Requirements:

VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems, VITEK 2 Systems (PC) version 9.04

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials combined with the nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with $0 . 4 5 \%$ to $0 . 5 0 \%$ saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System will automatically (or allow operator to manually) dilute the bacterial

suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then, the VITEK 2 will fill, seal and place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing, and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time. The analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based on attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the antimicrobial agent. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.

VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Omadacycline has the following concentrations in the card: 0.5, 2, 8 and $1 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ ).

# B Principle of Operation:

The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems use visible light to directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells. Transmittance optics is based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Every 15 minutes throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based on the VITEK 2 card), light transmittance readings of each well determine organism growth by the amount of light that is prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of the incubation period, the MIC values and their associated interpretive category results for each antimicrobial on the test card are displayed in an automatically generated report.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility testing for the VITEK 2 AST-GN card with Omadacycline was conducted at three clinical sites using a panel of ten Gram-negative bacilli consistent with the indications for use (i.e., eight $K .$ . pneumoniae pneumoniae, one $K .$ . pneumoniae and one $E .$ . cloacae isolates). Each isolate was tested in triplicate over three days for a total of 270 data points. Inocula were prepared using both the auto-dilution and manual dilution methods for testing in the VITEK 2 System. In addition, the inocula were prepared by the manual dilution method for use with the VITEK 2 Compact. The mode of MIC values was determined for each isolate and the reproducibility was calculated based on the number of MIC values that fell within $\pm 1$ doubling dilution of the mode MIC value. The majority of data points were on-scale and within $\pm$ one doubling dilution agreement as compared to the mode MIC. The data was analyzed taking into consideration best-case and worst-case scenarios as described in the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems. The reproducibility performance is shown in Table 1.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

Testing of omadacycline on the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card was performed at five clinical sites. There were 371 (IFU and non-IFU) clinical isolates and 89 challenge isolates tested for a total of 460 isolates. Results obtained with the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card with omadacycline were compared to results obtained with the CLSI broth microdilution (BMD) reference panel. The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Omadacycline is ${ \underline { { < 0 . 2 5 } } }$ to $2 1 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ for all species.

The testing conditions for the reference method consisted of the following:

• Medium: Mueller Hinton broth with the appropriate dilutions of antimicrobial solution added. Inoculum: Direct colony suspension   
• Incubation: $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ ; 16-24 hours

The VITEK 2 AST cards were inoculated with test organisms using the auto-dilution method (VITEK 2) and manual dilution method (VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact). All test inocula used for the VITEK 2 AST cards were standardized using the DensiCHEK Plus instrument.

A total of 371 clinical isolates were evaluated at four sites: $5 9 . 3 \%$ were considered contemporary isolates (isolated from clinical specimen and tested within 6 months) and $4 0 . 7 \%$ were stock isolates. Complete test results were available for all clinical isolates from 330 indicated species: 300 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 27 Enterobacter cloacae, and 3 Enterobacter cloacae complex isolates. Results were available from an additional 41 non-indicated clinical isolates and those were as follows: 2 Citrobacter freundii, 3 Citrobacter koseri, 3 Enterobacter aerogenes, 27 Escherichia coli, 3 Klebsiella oxytoca, and 3 Serratia marcescens. All clinical isolates were tested with the auto-dilution option of the VITEK 2.

A total of 89 challenge isolates were evaluated at one site. They included: 35 Enterobacter cloacae, 5 Enterobacter cloacae complex, 7 Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumoniae, and 42 Klebsiella pneumoniae. The challenge set was tested with the auto-dilution and manual dilution options of the VITEK 2 and with the manual dilution method on the VITEK 2 Compact.

When using the auto-dilution method of the VITEK 2, data was analyzed to determine performance with breakpoints established for CABP for $K .$ . pneumoniae. There were no major errors and one very major error $( 1 / 3 7 = 2 . 7 \%$ ). This VMJ error rate was considered acceptable as this was due to a single $K .$ . pneumoniae isolate among this smaller subset that was evaluated using the same breakpoints (CABP and ABSSSI). Collectively, the overall performance of $K .$ . pneumoniae was acceptable with an EA of $9 8 . 0 \%$ and a CA of $9 3 . 7 \%$ acceptable.

# Challenge Data –VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Manual Dilution

The 89 challenge isolates were also tested at one site with the manual dilution option for the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact systems and evaluated based on clinical indication: ABSSSI (Table 5). All results for the 89 isolates tested with the manual dilution method of the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact were evaluated using breakpoints established for ABSSSI (Table 5).

Taken together, the overall performance of $K .$ . pneumoniae is acceptable for the VITEK 2 Compact system.

To address testing and reporting of non-indicated species, the following statement is included in the Precautions section of the device labeling:

Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the safety and efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested by this AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those found in the indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of susceptibility information in those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for specific antimicrobial drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is approved.

# Resistance Mechanism Characterization

Omadacycline was active in vitro against Enterobacteriaceae expressing the TetB efflux pump and one $K .$ . pneumoniae challenge isolate expressing tet $( B )$ was included in the evaluation.

# MIC Trends

A trending analysis was conducted using the combined data (clinical and challenge) obtained from the VITEK 2 auto-dilution method for each indicated organism species (Table 7). This trending calculation analyzes device MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or higher than the reference method. MIC values that are off-scale for both the reference and device are not considered in the trending analysis. Species for which the difference between the percentage of isolates with higher or lower MIC values was $23 0 \%$ with a statistically significant confidence interval were considered to have evidence of trending.

# VIII Proposed Labeling:

The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.

# IX Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.

To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage (https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971. htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux intends to use to evaluate the VITEK 2 AST-GN Omadacycline when revised breakpoints for delafloxacin are published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included with the submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, bioMérieux will update the delafloxacin device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
