# II Submission/Device Overview:

# A Purpose for Submission:

To obtain a substantial equivalence determination for the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Respiratory (R) Panel performed on the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System.

# B Measurand:

The BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Respiratory (R) Panel detects and identifies nucleic acids from the following pathogens: Adenovirus, seasonal Coronavirus (229E, HKU1, OC43, NL63 not differentiated), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-Coronavirus-2, Human Metapneumovirus, Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus (not differentiated), Influenza A virus with subtyping of H3 and H1-2009 (reported separately), Influenza B virus, Parainfluenza Virus (serotypes 1-4, not differentiated), Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Bordetella parapertussis, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

# C Type of Test:

Multiplex nucleic acid assay for use with the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System for the qualitative detection of viral and/or bacterial pathogens in patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection.

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Respiratory (R) Panel (SPOTFIRE R Panel) is a multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test intended for use with the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System for the simultaneous, qualitative detection and identification of multiple respiratory viral and bacterial nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens obtained from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection, including COVID-19.

The following organism types and subtypes are identified and differentiated using the SPOTFIRE R Panel:

Viruses:

Adenovirus

Coronavirus (seasonal)

Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2

Human Metapneumovirus

Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus

Influenza A Virus

Influenza A virus A/H1-2009

Influenza A virus A/H3

Influenza B Virus

Parainfluenza Virus

Respiratory Syncytial Virus

Bacteria:

Bordetella parapertussis

Bordetella pertussis

Chlamydia pneumoniae

Mycoplasma pneumoniae

Nucleic acids from the viral and bacterial organisms identified by this test are generally detectable in NPS specimens during the acute phase of infection. The detection and identification of specific viral and bacterial nucleic acids from individuals exhibiting signs and/or symptoms of respiratory infection are indicative of the presence of the identified microorganism and aids in diagnosis if used in conjunction with other clinical and epidemiological information, and laboratory findings. The results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decisions.

Negative results in the setting of a respiratory illness may be due to infection with pathogens that are not detected by this test, or lower respiratory tract infection that may not be detected by an NPS specimen. Positive results do not rule out coinfection with other organisms. The agent(s) detected by the SPOTFIRE R Panel may not be the definite cause of disease.

Additional laboratory testing (e.g., bacterial and viral culture, immunofluorescence, and radiography) may be necessary when evaluating a patient with possible respiratory tract infection.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Respiratory (R) Panel (SPOTFIRE R Panel) is a multiplexed nucleic acid-amplification-based test that is intended to detect and identify 13 different respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection. The SPOTFIRE R Panel is performed on the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System, an automated polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based in vitro diagnostic system for use with reagent pouches for specific indications.

The BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System automates nucleic acid extraction and nested multiplex PCR in closed system. The resulting PCR products are evaluated using assay-specific DNA melting analysis. The BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System Software executes the SPOTFIRE R Panel test and interprets and reports the test results in approximately 15 minutes without user intervention.

The SPOTFIRE System is comprised of between one and four modules that are connected to a single SPOTFIRE Control Station equipped with the SPOTFIRE System Software. The first module is placed on top of the Control Station and up to three additional modules may be stacked on top as required. Each module can be accessed at random to perform a test, independent of the other modules attached to the same Control Station.

The SPOTFIRE R Panel Reagent Kit includes the following components:

• BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R Panel Pouches o Each packed under vacuum in a metal canister and outer bag • BIOFIRE Sample Preparation Reagent Kit (SPRK)

o A fixed volume transfer pipette for addition of the test sample to the Sample Injection Vial   
o BIOFIRE Sample Buffer ampoule for addition to the Sample Injection Vial   
o BIOFIRE Sample Injection Vial for mixing of the test sample and Sample Buffer   
o BIOFIRE Hydration Injection Vial containing Hydration Solution for pouch rehydration

# B Principle of Operation:

The BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Panel Pouch is a closed-system disposable that contains all the reagents needed for sample preparation, reverse transcription, PCR amplification and fluorescent detection, including melt curve analysis of amplified products. The rigid plastic “fitment” of the pouch contains reagents in freeze-dried form while the flexible plastic portion of the pouch is divided into discrete “blisters” in which different chemical processes are carried out. After sample collection, the user injects hydration solution and the sample combined with BIOFIRE Sample Buffer into the pouch, places the pouch into the SPOTFIRE System, and starts the run. All other operations are automated.

The SPOTFIRE System Software is designed to run on the SPOTFIRE Control Station which consists of an integrated computer and touchscreen. The SPOTFIRE Systems Software interfaces with the user via the touchscreen to operate the instrument, collect, save, analyze and retrieve data, report test results and view stored information. Meanwhile the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R Panel Software works with the System Software and specifies the assay-specific parameters to perform the test, interpret the data and display the reported results.

To perform a test with SPOTFIRE R Panel, the sample is first mixed with a denaturing Sample Buffer to inactivate nucleases. The user then loads the diluted sample into the SPOTFIRE R Panel Pouch via the injection port. The vacuum in the pouch draws the liquid into the sample well of the pouch fitment and in the process rehydrates the cell-based Process Control. The sample mixture is moved to the lysis blister where mechanical agitation with zirconia-silica beads is used to complete cell lysis. The lysate is then mixed with glass-coated magnetic beads which adsorb the nucleic acids liberated in the lysis step. The extracted nucleic acids are washed to remove potential inhibitors and then eluted into buffer that is used to rehydrate the contents of the first stage PCR blister, which includes all the components needed for reverse transcription (RT) and first stage PCR. RT-PCR is initiated upon achievement of the requisite temperature within the amplification chamber. Following completion of first-stage amplification, the products of the reaction are diluted and combined with fresh reagents that are distributed over a second stage PCR array. The second stage primers are internal (“nested”) with respect to the first stage primers and each analyte or control target is represented by three discrete amplification reactions. The second stage PCR array includes an assay control, the PCR2 Control, failure of which indicates a failure in the second stage PCR and invalidates the run.

Included in the PCR master mix for the second stage PCR is a fluorescent dye (LC Green Plus) that is specific for double-stranded DNA. The dye intercalates with the double stranded-PCR products and fluoresces at a specific wavelength that is detected by the SPOTFIRE System. At the end of the second stage PCR, the temperature of the array is gradually raised at a controlled ramp rate and the fluorescence is monitored. Fluorescence decreases at the melting temperature of the amplicons, and the temperature at which this occurs is characteristic of each amplification product. The software automatically evaluates the calculated melting temperature (Tm) in comparison to the predefined range for each specific analyte. The results from each of the three amplification reactions for each analyte are combined by the software to determine the test result. For an assay to be called positive, at least two of the three wells must have a PCR product with a Tm that is within the specified range for that analyte. Assays that do not meet these criteria are reported as negative.

Positive and negative results for the assay controls (Process Control and PCR2 Control) are compared to their expected values and assigned a “pass” or “fail” result. Panel-specific rules define how control failures affect interpretation of test results. For the SPOTFIRE R Panel, failure of either the RNA Process Control or PCR2 Control invalidates the results for all analytes. The final sample result is determined by the interpretation rules defined in the panel software.

For most bacteria and viruses detected by the SPOTFIRE R Panel, a “positive” result is reported if two or more of the wells corresponding to a single assay contain detectable PCR product of the appropriate Tm. However, to ensure inclusivity, certain analytes are targeted by multiple assays, the results of which are interpreted in combination, as described below in Tables 1 and 2.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System

2. Specimen Identification: Specimen identification can be entered manually or by scanning a barcode.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Use of the SPOTFIRE R Panel requires a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) to be collected according to standard procedures and placed in $1 { - } 3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of viral transport medium. The minimum sample volume required to perform a test is $3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ . Specimens should be tested as soon as possible following collection but may be stored for up to 4 hours at room temperature $( 1 5 . 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ or for up to 3 days at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or up to 30 days at $\le - 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

The SPOTFIRE System Software includes step-by-step on-screen instructions that guide the user through the process of starting a run on the instrument. After cleaning the work area and Pouch Loading Station, the user removes a SPOTFIRE R Panel pouch from its vacuum packaging and places it into the Pouch Loading Station. They then hydrate the pouch using the Hydration Injection Vial by injecting the contents through the Hydration Solution Injection Port, after which they transfer a fixed volume of sample to the Sample Injection Vial, together with the entire contents of the Sample Buffer ampoule. After mixing the Sample Injection Vial by invertion, the user injects the mixture into the pouch via the Sample Injection Port. The pouch is then inserted in the SPOTFIRE instrument, after which the run starts automatically and proceeds to completion without further user intervention, including interpretation of results.

4. Calibration:

The BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System is factory calibrated. User calibration is not required.

5. Quality Control:

Internal Controls Two process controls are included in each SPOTFIRE R Panel pouch:

1) RNA Process Control The RNA Process Control comprises freeze-dried Schizosaccharomyces pombe which is rehydrated when the sample is loaded. The control material is carried through all stages of the test process, including nucleic acid extraction and purification, reverse transcription, first and second stage PCR amplification and DNA melt analysis. A positive result indicates that all process steps carried out in the SPOTFIRE R Panel pouch were completed successfully.

# 2) PCR2 Control

The PCR2 control comprises a DNA target sequence that is dried into specific wells used for the second stage amplification and melting curve analysis. A positive result indicates that these processes were successful.

A positive result is required for both the RNA Process Control and the PCR2 Control for the results for an individual pouch to be considered valid. If either control fails, the sample should be retested using a new pouch.

External Controls

BIOFIRE recommends testing External Positive and Negative Controls that are commercially available from Maine Molecular Quality Controls, Inc. when training a new operator, or when a new shipment of SPOTFIRE panels or a new control station is received:

• SPOTFIRE RSP Positive Control (M42638) • SPOTFIRE RSP Negative Control (M42738)

These controls are designed to monitor the performance of each of the individual assays within the SPOTFIRE R Panel and should be tested in accordance with their FDA-cleared Instructions For Use (K221253).

The Instructions For Use of the SPOTFIRE R Panel indicate that an External Negative Control should be tested at least monthly to monitor for environmental contamination. Additional External Controls may be tested as needed.

External Positive and Negative Controls were tested during the Prospective Clinical Study described in Section VII (C). In total, 252 External Controls were tested of which 8 were associated with instrument errors, 4 were tested using an incorrect version of the reagent pouch and 4 were tested using the workflow for patient samples rather than Quality Control. As a result, there were 236 External Controls with valid results (109 Positive and 131 Negative). Of these, $9 9 . 1 \%$ of the External Positive Controls (108/109) and $100 \%$ of the External Negative Controls (131/131) produced the expected results.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility:

The reproducibility and precision of the SPOTFIRE R Panel on different BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Systems was evaluated with multiple operators who tested positive and negative samples over multiple days at three study sites, in addition to BIOFIRE Diagnostics. All analytes detected by the panel were evaluated using contrived positive specimens at concentrations equivalent to $\leq 3 \mathrm { X }$ their respective analytical limit of detection (LoD) (Table 3). Negative samples were prepared using artificial matrix only.

At BIOFIRE Diagnostics, testing was performed on three SPOTFIRE Systems, using three lots of reagents over five consecutive days. On each day of testing, two operators each tested three replicates of each sample (one per reagent lot) on each SPOTFIRE System for a total of 90 replicates per sample overall (2 operators x 3 samples $_ { \textrm { X 3 } }$ instruments x 5 days $= 9 0$ replicates).

At the external study sites, testing was performed with a single SPOTFIRE System at each site and occurred over five non-consecutive days using a single lot of reagents that was common across each of the sites. On each day, two operators each tested two replicates of each sample for a total of 60 replicates per sample overall (2 operators x 2 samples x 3 sites x 5 days $= 6 0$ replicates).

For each analyte there were 150 positive and 600 negative samples. Samples that produced an invalid result on initial testing due to process control failure $( \mathtt { n } = 1 2 )$ ) or instrument error (n $= 2$ ) were retested. Precision and reproducibility for each analyte were calculated by assessing the agreement between the reported test results and the expected results for each sample.

A summary of the results of the study, stratified by analyte and SPOTFIRE system/site is provided in Table 4. Positive agreement for all analytes was $> 9 5 \%$ and there was negligible difference between instruments, sites, reagent lots or operators. Negative agreement was $100 \%$ in all cases.

Overall, the reproducibility and precision of the SPOTFIRE R Panel for detection of the target analytes was determined to be acceptable.

1 1 positive sample was initially reported as Positive: Influenza A Virus (No Subtype Identified) and was therefore re-tested. The re-test result was as expected. The retest results from this sample for each analyte are included in the summary table.

2 2 positive samples were initially reported as Positive: Influenza A Virus (No Subtype Identified) and 1 positive sample was initially reported as Uncertain: Influenza A Virus. All 3 samples were retested and the retest results were as expected. The retest results from these samples for each analyte are included in the summary table.

$^ 3 1$ sample was reported as Uncertain Influenza A Virus but was not retested.

Not applicable.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

The analytical specificity (exclusivity) of the SPOTFIRE R Panel was evaluated through a combination of in silico analysis and laboratory testing of on- and off-panel species, phylogenetically related viruses and bacteria and other microorganisms that may be found in the respiratory tract.

In silico Analysis of Specificity (Exclusivity)   
In silico analysis of assay specificity/exclusivity was performed by conducting searches with whole amplicon and paired inner primer sequences using the NCBI BLAST “blastn” tool. The location and orientation of regions of homology with the primer sequences were evaluated to determine the potential for amplification. A summary of the results from the analysis is provided in Table 5. The SPOTFIRE R Panel assays were shown to be specific for their respective analytes with the following exceptions, which are noted in the device labeling:

• Cross-reaction of the SARS-CoV-2 assays with closely related bat and pangolin coronavirus sequences • Cross-reaction of the Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus assay with $B$ . pertussis, $B$ . parapertussis and B. bronchiseptica, in addition to bovine and canine picornaviruse • Cross-reaction of the $B$ . parapertussis assay with strains of B. bronchiseptica that carry IS1001 • Cross-reaction of the $C .$ . pneumoniae assay with Chlamydia gallinacea

1 Certain avian H1N2 sequences (AY233393 and AY038014) may also be detected and reported as H1-2009 Note: A sequence from Protopolystoma xenopodis (a parasitic worm found in frogs) exhibited significant homology to the pan-influenza A PCR primers and may be amplified but this organism is of no clinical relevance

# Laboratory Testing of Analytical Specificity

The analytical specificity (exclusivity) of the SPOTFIRE R Panel was also evaluated by testing high concentrations of on- and off-panel viruses, bacteria and other microorganisms that are phylogenetically related or may be found in nasopharyngeal and throat swab specimens. Analysis of on-panel analytes was performed to evaluate the potential for intrapanel cross-reactivity (i.e., detection of an analyte by an assay other than the target-specific assay for that analyte). Analysis of off-panel analytes was performed to evaluate the potential for cross-reaction with other respiratory flora that are not detected by the panel.

Each on-panel species was tested in triplicate and the results are shown in Tables 6 and 7. The expected results were obtained with each on-panel virus and no cross-reaction was observed (Table 6). Based on in silico analysis, it was predicted that $B _ { \cdot }$ . parapertussis and $B$ . pertussis would produce positive results with the Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus assay. $B$ . pertussis produced false-positive results at $1 . 3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 1 0 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ but was reported negative when tested at $1 . 3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 9 } \mathrm { \ : \dot { C } F U / m L }$ (Table 7). False-positive results were not observed with $B$ .

parapertussis at the concentration tested $( 4 . 6 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 9 } \mathrm { C F U / m L } )$ ). The potential for crossreaction of the human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus assay with both $B$ . parapertussis and $B$ . pertussis is noted in the device labeling.

CCU: Color Changing Units; CFU: Colony Forming Units; IFU: Inclusion Forming Units 1 In silico analysis predicted detection by the Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus assay but none was observed 2 Cross-reaction also predicted by in silico analysis

The potential for cross-reaction with off-panel analytes was evaluated by testing 87 stains of of bacteria, 2 species of fungus and 7 viruses that are either phylogenetically related to the on-panel analytes or which are commonly found in the respiratory tract (Table 8). No crossreaction was observed other than the detection of one strain of $B$ . bronchiseptica by the assay for $B _ { \cdot }$ . parapertussis that was predicted by in silico analysis.

# Interference Testing

A study was conducted to evaluate the potential for assay interference due to the presence of endogenous and exogenous substances that may be present in upper respiratory specimens. In addition, testing was also performed with representative on- and off-panel microorganisms at very high concentrations to evaluate the potential for competitive interference between analytes. Testing of each potentially interfering substance/microorganism was performed using contrived positive and negative specimens. The positive specimens contained representative on-panel analytes at concentrations equivalent to 3X their respective LoD (Table 10). The concentration of each potentially interfering substance tested was chosen to represent a high level that may be found in natural clinical specimens. The results of the study are summarized in Tables 11-13.

Results from the representative assays for which Contrived Positive Samples were prepared are shown in red Contrived Positive Samples contained the representative on-panel analytes at 3X LoD Contrived Negative Samples contained only the potentially interfering substance 1 Initially, 1/3 samples was reported as negative; therefore, 2 additional replicates were tested, both of which produced the expected results for all analytes 2 Initially, 1/3 samples was reported as invalid; the sample was retested and the results for all analytes were as expected

None of the endogenous substances tested caused reproducible interference with the SPOTFIRE R Panel.

Results from the representative assays for which Contrived Positive Samples were prepared are shown in red

Contrived Positive Samples contained the representative on-panel analytes at 3X LoD   
Contrived Negative Samples contained only the potentially interfering species   
1 Swab immersed in matrix for $1 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ prior to testing   
2 Initially, 1/3 samples was reported as invalid; therefore 2 additional replicates were tested and both produced the expected results for all analytes

None of the exogenous substances associated with collection of nasopharyngeal swab specimens tested were tested caused interference with the SPOTFIRE R Panel.

Results from the representative assays for which Contrived Positive Samples were prepared are shown in red Contrived Positive Samples contained the representative on-panel analytes at 3X LoD Contrived Negative Samples contained only the potentially interfering species 1 Initially 1/3 samples was reported as invalid due to an instrument error; the sample was retested and produced the expected result

None of the disinfectants or decontamination products that were tested caused interference with the SPOTFIRE R Panel. However, although bleach was not shown to have an adverse effect on test performance under the conditions of this study, a warning to avoid contact of test samples with bleach is included in the device labeling because of its known potential to cause nucleic acid degradation.

CFU: Colony Forming Units; IFU: Tissue Culture Infectious Dose- $50 \%$ Results from the representative assays for which Contrived Positive Samples were prepared are shown in red Contrived Positive Samples contained the representative on-panel analytes at 3X LoD Contrived Negative Samples contained only the potentially interfering species

No interference was observed with off-panel microbial species that may be present in nasopharyngeal swab specimens.

4. Assay Reportable Range: Not applicable.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

Specimen Stability

Viral Transport Medium The stability of most of the respiratory analytes targeted by the SPOTFIRE R Panel was demonstrated previously using simulated nasopharyngeal swab matrix in viral transport medium under K103175, K110764 and K120267 for the BIOFIRE FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP). Bordetella parapertussis and SARS-CoV-2 were not included in these studies but are biologically similar to other analytes on the panel (i.e., $B .$ . pertussis and other seasonal coronaviruses). The original specimen stability studies with the FilmArray RP are therefore applicable to support transport and storage claims for nasopharyngeal swab specimens in viral transport medium for use with the SPOTFIRE R Panel (i.e., 4 hours at $1 5 . 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 3 days at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or 30 days at $< - 1 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ).

# $0 . 9 \%$ Saline

A stability study was conducted with nasopharyngeal specimens in $0 . 9 \%$ saline under DEN200031 for the BIOFIRE FilmArray Respiratory Panel 2.1. Included in the study were all the analytes for this specimen type that are applicable to the SPOTFIRE R Panel. The results of the study therefore support the stability of the SPOTFIRE R Panel analytes in $0 . 9 \%$ saline (4 hours at $1 5 . 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 3 days at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or 30 days at $< - 1 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ).

6. Detection Limit:

Analytical Sensitivity

The Limit of Detection (LoD) for each analyte on the SPOTFIRE R Panel was determined with samples prepared using artificial nasopharyngeal swab matrix in Viral Transport Medium. A study showing that the formulation of the artificial matrix neither enhanced nor impaired assay performance is described in Section VII B(2). The identity and concentration of each viral or bacterial stock used in the study was either certified by the commercial supplier or confirmed by quantitative real-time or digital PCR and standard methods. An initial titration of each viral or bacterial stock was performed to estimate the LoD, which was then confirmed by testing 20 replicates at the estimated LoD concentration and at one 10-fold lower dilution. The LoD was considered confirmed if $\geq 1 9 / 2 0$ replicates at the estimated LoD concentration produced Positive results and $\leq 1 8 / 2 0$ replicates at a 10-fold lower concentration were reported as Negative.

For efficiency, the LoD study was conducted by co-spiking multiple analytes into each sample. Therefore, additional testing was performed using a representative subset of target analytes to determine whether testing of multiple species in the same reaction had any effect test performance. Samples containing a single analyte were tested in replicates of 6 in parallel with samples containing the same analyte in addition to other viruses/bacteria on the SPOTFIRE R Panel. Overall, the results of the study showed that there was negligible difference in the analytical sensitivity of the SPOTFIRE R Panel from the presence of multiple target analytes in a sample (Tables 17 and 18).

# Inclusivity (Analytical Reactivity)

The inclusivity of the SPOTFIRE R Panel was evaluated using a combination of in silico analysis of publicly available sequence information and laboratory testing of contrived specimens containing viral and bacterial isolates that were selected to represent phylogenetic, geographic and temporal diversity.

# In silico Analysis of Inclusivity

BLAST searches were conducted to obtain all available gene target sequences for each assay with the SPOTFIRE R Panel. In silico analysis of the inclusivity of the panel was performed using concatenated alignments of the nested primer sets for each target region. Mismatches to the primers were evaluated for their potential to affect detection of the target analyte based on their number and location within each primer sequence. In silico analysis of the SPOTFIRE R Panel primers showed that the target sequences are generally well conserved and that the assays are predicted to be robust to known mutations in these regions, with the ability to detect all or nearly all isolates of the targeted analytes.

In silico analysis of the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 was performed using all available sequences in the GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data) database as of December 21, 2022. Included in the analysis were 11,989,970 sequences of which $\geq 9 9 . 9 9 \%$ were predicted to be detected by one or both SARS-CoV-2 assays within the SPOTFIRE R Panel, including sequences of all lineages, Variants of Concern and Variants of Interest identified to-date. Impaired sensitivity for detection by both SARS-CoV-2 assays was predicted for $< 0 . 0 0 4 \%$ of sequences evaluated (427/11,989,970).

# Laboratory Testing of Inclusivity

Contrived samples containing individual viruses and bacteria were prepared at approximately 3X LoD containing artificial matrix and tested in triplicate (unless noted in the tables below). All the viral and bacterial isolates tested were successfully detected (Tables 19-32).

# 7. Assay Cut-Off:

DNA melt curve analysis is used to determine the presence or absence of the specific amplification product(s) corresponding to each analyte within the SPOTFIRE R Panel. The Melt Detector software analyzes each well of the second stage PCR array independently. A series of mathematical tests is applied to each fluorescence curve to discriminate targetspecific amplicon from system noise and non-specific amplification products, taking into account both system variation and known sequence variation within the amplified regions targeted by the assay. The Melt Detector algorithm was developed by tuning against a large data set comprised of both typical and atypical melt curves that were assigned as positive or negative by manual review performed by expert users. The tuning process optimized the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm in comparison to manual result interpretation and included optimization of the order of procedural steps and the respective threshold for each parameter.

For each assay within the SPOTFIRE R Panel, the expected melting temperature (mean Tm) was determined empirically using the most common sequence variants. The acceptable range around the mean was then determined through a combination of empirical testing of known sequence variants and mathematical modeling. Reference data obtained from analysis of templates with known sequences were used to estimate additional sources of system variability, including the SPOTFIRE instrument and reagents. The melt range parameters for each analyte were validated in the subsequent Analytical and Clinical Studies.

# Refer to Section VII (C) Clinical Studies.

# 9. Carry-Over:

The potential for sample-to-sample cross-contamination during operation of the SPOTFIRE System was evaluated by testing an alternating series of positive and negative contrived samples using the same Pouch Loading Station. The positive samples comprised high levels of representative on-panel analytes in artificial matrix. Negative samples comprised artificial matrix alone. No unexpected positive results were observed from a total of 15 negative samples that were tested. These results demonstrated that there is an acceptable, low likelihood of cross-contamination between samples when the SPOTFIRE R Panel is performed according to the instructions for use.

# Artificial vs Natural Matrix

The SPOTFIRE R Panel is intended to detect multiple viral and bacterial analytes in nasopharyngeal swab specimens. The high frequency of positive samples for at least one analyte makes it impractical to use natural clinical matrices for analytical validation studies for which large volumes of negative matrix are required. To address this, artificial matrix was used for most of the analytical testing and therefore an additional study was conducted to demonstrate that the analytical sensitivity of the SPOTFIRE R Panel was similar with samples prepared in artificial and natural specimen matrices, as described below.

Artificial nasopharyngeal swab (aNS) matrix comprised glycerol, porcine mucin, human whole blood, phosphate buffered saline and saline diluted in transport medium (Viral Transport Medium [VTM]). Testing was performed using a representative subset of analytes targeted by the SPOTFIRE R Panel, including both DNA and RNA viruses. Ten-fold serial dilutions of each analyte were prepared in artificial matrix and, in parallel, in natural clinical matrix obtained from asymptomatic donors. Prior to conducting the study, the natural clinical specimens were tested to verify that none of the on-panel analytes were present. A summary of the results is presented in Table 34.

Positive results were obtained for all replicates with each analyte at target levels equal to or above the claimed LoD except for Adenovirus in natural clinical matrix for which only $4 / 6$ replicates $( 6 7 \% )$ were reported positive at the claimed LoD concentration. However, amplification curve characteristics for Adenovirus were similar between positive replicates in both the artificial and natural nasopharyngeal swab matrices at the LoD target level for this analyte and all replicates in both matrices were positive at a 10-fold higher concentration, suggesting that the analytical sensitivity of the assay with the two matrices is similar.

Overall, the results of the matrix equivalency study showed that the use of artificial matrix does not enhance or impair device performance and is acceptable for analytical validation of assay performance.

Fresh vs Frozen Samples

A study was performed with the BIOFIRE FilmArray Respiratory Panel under K160068 using fresh and frozen nasopharyngeal swabs which showed that there were no adverse effects from freezing and thawing of specimens. Because of the similarities between the BIOFIRE FilmArray Respiratory Panel and the SPOTFIRE R Panel in terms of the targeted analytes, technology and reagent formulations, these data are considered acceptable to support testing of archived, frozen specimens in the Clinical Study to evaluate the performance of the SPOTFIRE R Panel.

# Transport Media Equivalency

A study was conducted to evaluate the compatibility of the SPOTFIRE R Panel with alternative transport media, including $0 . 9 \%$ normal saline, Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (Gibco), BD Universal Viral Transport (UVT) medium (BD Medical), and Remel MicroTest M4RT (Thermo Fisher). Testing was performed using contrived samples in artificial nasopharyngeal swab matrix containing representative analytes (including bacteria and DNA and RNA viruses) at concentrations spanning the claimed analytical LoD (5X, 1X and 0.2X LoD). For the purposes of the study, the test analytes were prepared in the form of two panels, each of 5 on-panel species. The results obtained with each of the alternative transport media were compared to those obtained using Viral Transport Medium (VTM) as a control and are summarized in Table 35.

The results of the study met the acceptance criteria in all cases thereby demonstrating the compatibility of the SPOTFIRE R Panel with $0 . 9 \%$ Saline, Hanks Balanced Salt Solution, BD UVT medium and M4RT transport medium.

# C Clinical Studies:

# 1. Clinical Sensitivity:

The clinical performance of the SPOTFIRE R Panel was evaluated using a combination of prospectively collected and archived specimens as described below.

Prospectively Collected Specimens

A Clinical Study with prospectively collected specimens was conducted at five sites (4 U.S. and 1 ex-U.S.), including adult and pediatric emergency departments/urgent care centers, that were considered representative of the intended use settings for the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System and SPOTFIRE R Panel. The specimens included in the study were either collected under Informed Consent (if required by the participating institution), and with parental permission for minors $< 1 8$ years of age or were leftover (residual) samples from standard of care testing. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study, which spanned the period between December 2020 to June 2021, are summarized in Table 36. Aliquots of each specimen were prepared for testing with the SPOTFIRE R Panel and the applicable comparator method(s). All aliquots of nasopharyngeal swab specimens for comparator testing were stored at $\mathrm { - 7 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C }$ . At each of the study sites, specimen enrollment began prior to the availability of BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE instruments.

A total of 1215 nasopharyngeal were initially enrolled in the Prospective Clinical Study, of which 95 were excluded from the analysis of performance for the reasons listed in Table 38. In addition, some specimens were excluded from the analysis of performance for one or more specific analytes due to improper storage of sample aliquots or to failure or inappropriate conduct of the comparator method and inability to perform retesting due volume constraints. All nasopharyngeal swabs included in the analysis of performance were collected in viral transport medium (VTM).

# Archived Specimens

Several analytes included on the SPOTFIRE R Panel were not encountered during the Prospective Clinical Study in sufficient numbers to demonstrate system performance.

Therefore, the Prospective Clinical Study was supported by additional testing that was performed at the four U.S. study sites on frozen, archived specimens obtained from various clinical laboratories from around the world. These specimens were selected for inclusion in the study based on their microbial content as originally determined by the source laboratory and were stored frozen prior to testing. The microbial content of the archived specimens was confirmed using the same molecular comparator methods as for the prospectively collected specimens (Table 37). A mimimum sample volume of $6 5 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ was required for confirmatory testing.

A total of 562 archived nasopharyngeal swabs was obtained, of which 20 were excluded from the analysis of performance due to invalid SPOTFIRE R Panel results or to invalid or missing comparator test results (Table 40).

# Clinical Performance

A summary of the results from testing prospectively collected and archived nasopharyngeal swabs is shown in Table 42. Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) ranged from $9 6 . 3 \substack { - 1 0 0 \% }$ for prospectively collected specimens and from $9 6 . 0 \substack { - 1 0 0 \% }$ for archived specimens, depending on the analyte, whereas Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) ranged from $9 0 . 6 \substack { - 1 0 0 \% }$ for prospectively collected specimens and from $9 6 . 7 – 1 0 0 \%$ for archived specimens. The only analyte for which NPA was $< 9 5 \%$ was Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus with prospectively collected specimens. However, additional testing provided evidence for the presence of Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus in $5 4 / 7 2$ prospectively collected specimens $( 7 5 . 0 \% )$ with discordant positive SPOTFIRE R Panel results and therefore the low NPA with this analyte in the prospective study was considered acceptable.

Overall, the SPOTFIRE R Panel exhibited acceptable PPA and NPA in comparison to other FDA-cleared methods for the detection of the targeted analytes in nasopharyngeal swab specimens.
