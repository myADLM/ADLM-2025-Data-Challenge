Enclosure

Device Name ARCHITECT HSV-1 IgG

Indications for Use (Describe)

The ARCHITECT HSV-1 IgG assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) used for the qualitative detection of specific IgG antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in human serum (collected in serum and serum separator tubes) and plasma (collected in dipotassium EDTA, lithium heparin, and lithium heparin plasma separator tubes) on the ARCHITECT i System.

The ARCHITECT HSV-1 IgG assay is to be used for testing sexually active adults or expectant mothers to aid in the presumptive diagnosis of HSV-1 infection. The test results may not determine the state of active lesions or associated disease manifestations, particularly for primary infection. The predictive value of a reactive or nonreactive result depends on the prevalence of HSV-1 infection in the population and the pre-test likelihood of HSV-1 infection.

NOTE: The performance of the ARCHITECT HSV-1 IgG assay has not been established for use in the pediatric population, for neonatal screening, or for testing immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patients. The assay has not been FDA cleared or approved for screening blood or plasma donors.

Sample, HSV-1 specific recombinant gG1 antigen coated paramagnetic microparticles, and assay diluent are combined and incubated. The IgG antibodies to HSV-1 (HSV-1 IgG) present in the sample bind to the HSV-1 specific recombinant gG1 antigen coated microparticles. The mixture is washed. Anti-human IgG acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to create a reaction mixture and incubated. Following a wash cycle, Pre-Trigger and Trigger Solutions are added. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as a relative light unit (RLU). There is a relationship between the amount of HSV-1 IgG in the sample and the RLU detected by the system optics. The presence or absence of HSV-1 IgG in the sample is determined by comparing the chemiluminescent RLU in the reaction to the cutoff RLU determined from an active calibration.</td></tr></table>

# 9. Performance Summary

# Tube Type Matrix Comparison

A total of 62 sets of unique serum samples paired with samples collected in serum separator, dipotassium EDTA plasma, lithium heparin plasma, and lithium heparin plasma separator tubes were evaluated with the ARCHITECT HSV-1 IgG assay on the ARCHITECT i2000SR instrument to support equivalent performance using each of these specimen types.

A weighted Deming regression analysis was performed in the whole assay range and around the cut-off, separately.

The following tube types are acceptable for use with the ARCHITECT HSV-1 IgG assay:

• Serum (serum and serum separator) • Plasma (dipotassium EDTA, lithium heparin, and lithium heparin separator)

# werfen

On average, the tube types evaluated showed less than a $10 \%$ difference for reactive HSV-1 IgG samples and less than $0 . 1 \mathrm { S } / \mathrm { C O }$ absolute difference for nonreactive HSV-1 IgG samples when compared to the control tube type (serum). The distribution of the percent differences per tube type for reactive samples is listed in the following table.

# CDC Panel Agreement

The CDC Performance Panel was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and tested using the ARCHITECT HSV-1 IgG assay. The panel consisted of 2 aliquots each of 50 serum samples with unknown HSV-1 status for a total of 100. The results were submitted to the CDC for data evaluation and do not imply endorsement of the assay by the CDC.

The ARCHITECT HSV-1 IgG assay demonstrated $1 0 0 \%$ positive percent agreement (PPA) for reactive samples (46/46) and $100 \%$ negative percent agreement (NPA) for nonreactive samples (54/54) when evaluating the CDC panel.

Clinical Agreement Study

A multi-center clinical study was conducted to evaluate the clinical performance of the ARCHITECT HSV-1 IgG assay. Sensitivity and specificity were estimated using PPA and NPA as determined by comparing the performance of the ARCHITECT HSV-1 IgG assay to a composite comparator method comprised of a commercially available anti-HSV-1 IgG immunoblot method (comparator assay) and a Western Blot reference confirmatory test (University of Washington, Seattle).

A total of 915 specimens, which included sexually active individuals and pregnant females, were collected prospectively within the US and tested at 3 independent external laboratories.

The PPA and NPA results are summarized in the following tables.
