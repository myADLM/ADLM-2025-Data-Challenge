# PCR Interfering Substances

Exogenous interfering substance studies were conducted in the original BD MAX EBP and BD MAX xEBP clearance. An additional interference study was conducted to assess the contents of the Copan FecalSwab Collection, Transport and Preservation System using the sample processing control (SPC) that is included with BD MAX EBP and BD MAX xEBP assays. The SPC target is intended to monitor the presence of potential inhibitory substances in each reaction. The study was designed to leave the swabs inside the transport device tubes for the duration of the incubation period and amplification of the sample processing control (SPC) target was successful at every stability time point tested. The results indicate that there was no interference or inhibition in any of the components of the FecalSwab collection, transport, and preservation system. The SPC monitors DNA extraction, thermal cycling, reagent integrity and the presence of inhibitory substances. Results of tests are shown in table 1 below.

# Microbial Interfering Substances

Microbial interference studies were conducted in the original BD MAX EBP and BD MAX xEBP clearance. No modifications were made to the BD MAX EBP and BD MAX xEBP assay design, reagents, workflow, algorithm, or interpretation of results. When the Copan FecalSwab device is used in combination with BD MAX EBP and BD MAX xEBP the media does not have any effect on BD instruments or any effect on signal overlap.

4. Assay Reportable Range: Not Applicable

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods): Sterilization

No changes to the sterile barrier (film-film peel-pouch), sterilization method, sterilization dose and SAL have been made to the device since the original clearance of the Copan FecalSwab Collection, Transport and Preservation System (K142094).

# Shelf Life

The FecalSwab has a claimed shelf life of 15 months. The FecalSwab was verified to meet performance requirements for enteric bacteria viability through 15 months in the studies submitted with the original FecalSwab premarket notification (K142094).

# Bacterial Recovery (Viability)

Bacterial Recovery (Viability) Studies in the original clearance for the Copan fecal swab (K142094) did not include Plesiomonas shigelloides (P. shigelloides) (ATCC 14029) as a claimed organism. $P .$ . shigelloides is a claimed organism on the BD MAX EBP and xEBP panel and as a result $P$ . shigelloides is added to the claimed organisms for the subject device. All other organisms claimed on the BD MAX EBP and xEBP panel have been previously validated with viability studies using the subject device (K142094). Recovery studies were conducted to evaluate the ability of the FecalSwab to maintain viability of $P _ { - }$ . shigelloides. The organism was spiked into negative clinical fecal matrix then stored at $2 0 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 48 hrs. and at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $7 2 \mathrm { { h r s } }$ . The stability study was conducted using three production lots. Viability studies used the roll plate method and the swab elution method. Different dilutions of $P _ { - }$ . shigelloides were contrived using clinical negative fecal matrix followed by immediately adding the stool and organisms into the subject transport device. The negative clinical fecal matrix was prepared using formed stools from more than 4 healthy asymptomatic subjects. The pooled stool was then homogenized in Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) $30 \%$ stool in $70 \%$ PBS). The media was confirmed to be negative by plating a portion of each pool on an appropriate agar plate.

To distinguish and count the target colonies in the case of $P$ . shigelloides, in the presence of resistant flora, a differential and selective agar were used to grow the target organism (Inositol Brilliant Green Bile Agar). For the swab elution method, the inoculum suspension was prepared by making a direct suspension in $0 . 8 5 \%$ physiological saline $\left( \mathrm { p H } 6 . 8 – 7 . 2 \right)$ of isolated colonies from approximately $1 . 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { C F U / m l }$ , (0.5 McFarland standard). This inoculum was diluted 10 folds in fecal matrix to provide suspensions with concentrations of $1 . 5 \mathrm { { x } 1 0 ^ { 4 } \mathrm { { C F U } / m l } }$ , $1 . 5 \mathrm { { x } 1 0 ^ { 3 } \mathrm { { C F U } / m l } }$ , and $1 . 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ i 0 ^ { 2 } ~ C F U / m L }$ . $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of an inoculum was pipetted onto swabs and placed into tubes and stored $\mathrm { T } = 0$ , 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours) (3 lots used) for each holding temperature or time combination. The zero-time controls were plated in triplicates for each inoculum concentrations prepared. All other spiked swabs and media were held at specified temperatures for specific times (at $2 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 6, 24, 48 hrs. and at 2- $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for 6, 24, 48, and $7 2 \mathrm { ~ h r s . }$ ). After each specific time point and storage condition, all tubes were vortexed for a minimum of 5 seconds and the medium was then plated by pipetting 100 $\mu \mathrm { L }$ from each tube onto the appropriate culture medium in triplicates (Inositol Brilliant Green Bile Agar) and incubated at $3 5 \pm 2 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ in an aerobic atmosphere for 24 hrs. The colonies were then counted (only pink colored colonies were appropriate for counting). The average CFU was determined for each concentration for each time point and storage condition.

The inoculum for the roll plate method was prepared the same way as the swab elution method above, with $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ aliquots of the prepared inoculum diluted to $1 . 5 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ , $1 . 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 3 }$ and $1 . 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 2 } \mathrm { C F U / m l }$ . The dilutions were transferred into 24-wells at time 0, 6, 24, 48, and $7 2 \mathrm { { h r s } }$ . for plating onto the appropriate culture medium and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $2 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The swab was used to transfer the inoculum into the subject device according to the instructions for use. Each time point and storage condition were made in triplicate. At each time point tested, the swabs were removed from the subject device and the media was inoculated on the surface of Inositol Brilliant Green Bile Agar culture medium plates by rolling the swab across the surface of the culture media. Plates were incubated at $3 5 { - } 3 7 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ for 24 hrs. with only pink colonies being counted and the average CFU calculated from 3 plates from each holding temperature and each concentration.

The acceptance criteria for both bacterial recovery methods were as follows: Cultures from transport medium tubes held at both $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $2 0 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 6hrs., 24 hrs., 48 hrs., and 72hrs. for each temperature must remain within $2 \log _ { 1 0 }$ of the initial microorganism concentration (time point 0). All data demonstrated the ability of the FecalSwab to maintain viability of bacteria under the claimed conditions of use (table 2 and 3).

# Specimen Storage Stability

Nucleic acid storage and stability was evaluated for specimens stored in the FecalSwab collection device under the same storage conditions claimed in BD MAX EBP and BD MAX xEBP clearance when using preserved stool specimens. Acceptable storage conditions for preserved stool specimens in the original clearance for BD MAX EBP and BD MAX xEBP were either $2 5 \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h r s }$ . or $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 5 days prior to testing. A study was conducted to test the previously cleared stability claims of $2 5 \pm 2 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ for 24 hrs. or $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 5 days, using the subject transport device.

Studies included a nested stability testing to show that specimens stored in FecalSwab medium at the described conditions (i.e., Day 1: 24 hours in FecalSwab at $2 5 { \pm } 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , Day 3: 24 hours in FecalSwab at $2 5 { \pm } 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } + 4 8$ hours at $2 5 { \pm } 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in SBT, Day 6: 24 hours in FecalSwab at $2 5 { \pm } 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { + } 5$ days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in SBT, Day 5: 5 days in FecalSwab at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , Day 7: 5 days in FecalSwab at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } + 4 8$ hours at $2 5 { \pm } 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in SBT, and Day 10: 5 days in FecalSwab at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } + 5$ days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in SBT) continued to be stable at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 120 hours (5 days) or at $2 5 \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 48 hours. The study included four panels consisting of two different organisms mixed into each panel. Each panel used clinical matrix and was contrived at a concentration of $2 \textbf { x }$ LoD (Table 4). The acceptance criteria for the Fecalswab were a minimum of $9 5 \%$ detection for all targets at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 120 hours (5 days) or at $2 5 \pm 2 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ for up to 48 hours when SBT was used as described above in parentheses and results showed that each organism tested for both BD MAX EBP and xEBP had $\ge 9 5 \%$ detection at all the target storage stability time points claimed in the package insert (as shown in Table 5).

# 6. Detection Limit (LoD):

LoD studies were performed to determine the analytical sensitivity with the BD MAX EBP and BD MAX xEBP System when used with the FecalSwab specimen collection device has similar analytical performance compared to raw stool when used with these systems. The pooled negative clinical stool matrix was pre-tested with an FDA cleared assay for each target organism and determined to be negative prior to use. The stool matrix was used as a negative sample or was spiked to generate positive samples with the following organisms: Salmonella typhimurium, ATCC 14028; Escherichia coli STX1, ATCC 43890; Campylobacter jejuni, ATCC 43429 and Shigella sonnei, ATCC 9290. A 0.5 McFarland standard was made for each organism and further diluted. The $0 . 5 \mathrm { M c F }$ arland was confirmed with culture to determine the CFU/mL concentration, each organism was then serially diluted down to the LoD. The LoD is reported in CFU/mL.

$1 5 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ each of the inoculated stool samples was used to spike 12 tubes of the FecalSwab transport medium according to the IFU. After inoculation, $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of each inoculated FecalSwab tube specimens were transferred into a total of 24 BD MAX sample buffer tubes (SBTs) in parallel according to the manufacturer’s instructions for BD MAX assays. This procedure was repeated for each dilution and mix. The external controls were processed and tested as described in the BD MAX EBP and BD MAX xEBP IFUs. The LoD is the concentration at which $> 9 5 \%$ of the sample tested positive. Table 6 and 7 include the LoD concentrations of organisms in $\mathrm { C F U / m L }$ when FecalSwab specimens were tested with the BD MAX EBP and BD MAX xEBP.

For each organism tested across both the BD MAX enteric bacterial panel and extended bacterial panel, an LoD was identified. These results support that the FecalSwab has equivalent analytical performance to raw stool when used with BD MAX EBP and BD MAX xEBP cleared devices.

# Analytical Specificity-False positivity

The analytical specificity of the BD MAX System when used with the FecalSwab specimens was evaluated using data generated from the storage stability studies. This study was designed to demonstrate that the FecalSwab medium does not interfere with BD MAX EBP and BD MAX xEBP SBTs resulting in false positive results. Three lots of negative pooled stool matrix were prepared from 4 healthy, asymptomatic volunteers and homogenized in PBS to serve as negative fecal matrix ( $30 \%$ stool and $70 \%$ PBS). All of the FecalSwab tubes with the negative fecal matrix were processed according to the package insert. These samples were then tested on the BD MAX systems after generating two SBTs from each individual collection tube initially inoculated (3 Copan FecalSwab lots were used). Data from the FecalSwab media and negative fecal matrix is presented in table 8. Testing resulted in no false positive results.

$^ { * 2 }$ SBTs have been excluded from the final calculation since an environmental contamination occurred during test.

# Cross-Reactivity of FecalSwab Specimens with BD MAX EBP and BD MAX xEBP

Cross-Reactivity studies were conducted and validated in the original clearance of the BD MAX EBP and BD MAX xEBP using unpreserved stool. In the previous clearance unpreserved stool was determined to be the most challenging specimen type. The FecalSwab collection device has no impact on the genetic sequences of potentially cross-reacting

organisms and no changes were made to the BD MAX EBP or BD MAX xEBP assay primers or probes to accommodate FecalSwab preserved stool specimens. It was concluded that no additional cross-reactivity studies were necessary.
