• Giardia lamblia   
• Cryptosporidium (C. hominis and C. parvum only)   
• Entamoeba histolytica

# C Type of Test:

The BD MAX EPP is a Qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the amplification and detection of DNA from Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium (C. hominis and $C .$ . parvum only), and Entamoeba histolytica.

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s):

See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The BD MAX EPP performed on the BD MAX System is an automated in vitro diagnostic test for the direct qualitative detection of enteric parasitic pathogens. The BD MAX EPP detects nucleic acids from:

Giardia lamblia • Cryptosporidium (C. hominis and C. parvum only) Entamoeba histolytica

Testing is performed on unpreserved or $10 \%$ formalin-fixed stool specimens or FecalSwab specimens from symptomatic patients with suspected gastroenteritis, enteritis or colitis. The assay is intended to aid in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal infection when used in conjunction with clinical evaluation and other laboratory findings. The test is performed directly on the specimen, utilizing real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the amplification of specific targets. The test utilizes fluorogenic gene-specific hybridization probes for detection of the amplified DNA.

This test is intended for use, in conjunction with clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and epidemiological information, as an aid in the differential diagnosis of Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium hominis, and C. parvum, as well as Entamoeba histolytica infections. Results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decision. Positive results do not rule out co-infection with other organisms that are not detected by this test, and may not be the sole or definitive cause of patient illness. Negative results in the setting of clinical illness compatible with gastroenteritis and/or colitis may be due to infection by pathogens that are not detected ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, or Crohn’s disease.

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Rx - For Prescription Use Only   
D Special Instrument Requirements: BD MAX EPP is performed on the BD MAX System

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The BD MAX EPP assay together with the BD MAX System contain an instrument with associated hardware and accessories, disposable microfluidic cartridges, master mixes, unitized reagent strips, and extraction reagents. The instrument automates sample preparation including target lysis, DNA extraction and concentration, reagent rehydration, target nucleic acid amplification and detection using real-time PCR. The assay includes a Sample Processing Control (SPC) that is present in the Extraction Tube. The SPC monitors DNA extraction steps, thermal cycling steps, reagent integrity and the presence of inhibitory substances. The BD MAX System software automatically interprets test results. For the BD MAX EPP, a test result may be called POS, NEG or UNR (Unresolved) based on the amplification status of the targets and of the Sample Processing control. IND (Indeterminate) or INC (Incomplete) results are due to BD MAX System failure.

# B Principle of Operation:

The principles of the test remain unchanged from K143648, other than addition of stool specimens collected with the FecalSwab Collection, Transport, and Preservation System as an additional validated specimen type.

The BD MAX EPP is to be used with raw unpreserved stool specimens, $10 \%$ Formalin preserved stool specimens or stool in FecalSwab specimens. Unpreserved samples are placed in a BD MAX sample buffer tube (SBT) with a $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ transfer loop for analysis on the BD MAX System. Specimens preserved in $10 \%$ Formalin utilizes a plastic paddle (scoop) to place a stool sample into $1 5 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of $10 \%$ Formalin media for transport before being placed into a SBT with a $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ transfer loop prior to analysis on the BD MAX System.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name:

# For the instrument:

# BD MAX For the assay: BD MAX EPP

2. Specimen Identification:

Unpreserved or $10 \%$ formalin-fixed stool or FecalSwab unpreserved collected stool specimens from symptomatic patients with suspected gastroenteritis, enteritis, or colitis.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Once specimens (Unpreserved, $10 \%$ Formalin, or FecalSwab) are placed into a BD MAX SBT, the principles of the test are as described in K143648.

The BD MAX EPP assay is designed for use on the BD MAX System (K111860), an automated sample-to-answer processor that enables on-board extraction of nucleic acids and PCR amplification to provide diagnostic results and remains unchanged from K143648. This submission is only for the addition of a new collection/transport device (FecalSwab) to the existing assay as performed on the BD MAX System. Since the previously cleared BD MAX System hardware was not modified to accommodate the new collection device, electrical safety evaluation is not required. Instrument software updates were reported regularly upon new assay submissions.

No changes have been made to the BD MAX EPP assay contents, which are presented in Table 1. Table 2 provides the contents of the FecalSwab.

2. Linearity:

Not Applicable

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Analytical Specificity/Cross-Reactivity: Analytical specificity/cross-reactivity was evaluated previously in the presence of unpreserved stool which represents the most challenging specimen type. Please refer to K143648. No specificity issues were identified from additional studies conducted to support testing FecalSwab stool specimens.

Interference Substances (exogenous/endogenous): Interfering substances were previously evaluated in the presence of unpreserved stool which contains the highest concentration of potential inhibitors. Please refer to K143648.

4. Assay Reportable Range: Not Applicable

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

Positive and Negative External Controls: External control materials are not provided by BD; however, Quality Control material was previously addressed in the original submission, please refer to K143648.

6. Detection Limit:

Limit of Detection (LoD) Study: An LoD study was conducted to demonstrate the performance of the FecalSwab to preserve the target analytes for use with the BD Max EPP assay. The LoD study was performed for each of the three (3) targets of this assay (Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia lamblia) in FecalSwab specimens following a two-phase study design. The study was designed to ensure the FecalSwab does not introduce bias into the BD Max EPP assay. The LoD study prepared target analyte panels in unpreserved stool matrix and FecalSwab. The BD MAX EPP Sample Buffer Tubes were prepared for each specimen panel: unpreserved (UNP) stool specimens and FecalSwab (FS) specimens.

In the first phase of the study, a preliminary LoD for each target was determined by testing multiple replicate specimens $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 2 )$ of each target in negative clinical matrix at low concentrations until two critical concentrations were identified: a target concentration with $100 \%$ positive rate, and a lower concentration, within five-fold dilution, with a positive rate greater than zero and less than $100 \%$ . The preliminary LoD was defined in this study as the lowest target concentration with a $100 \%$ positive rate. Target concentrations used for each spiked stool specimen for LoD determination is shown in Table 3.

In the second phase of the study, the size of the test panels was increased to 20 replicates per concentration. The first concentration evaluated for each target was the preliminary LoD, as determined in the first phase of the study. If the positive rate for this test panel was exactly $9 5 \%$ (19/20), the preliminary LoD would be ‘confirmed’ for that target and specimen type. If the positive rate at the preliminary LoD was not $9 5 \%$ , additional testing would be conducted. The sample from the initial LoD was run in 20 replicates and achieved a 19/20 positives $9 5 \%$ positivity) rate and was considered the final LoD.

The LoD determination and confirmation positivity rates obtained for each Entamoeba histolytica level tested are reported in Table 4. The LoD determination required an additional dilution (4 orgs/mL stool) because the initial five dilutions obtained a positivity rate of $100 \%$ The initial LoD concentration for Entamoeba histolytica was 20 orgs/mL stool for both FecalSwab and unpreserved specimens, corresponding to the lowest target level to achieve $100 \%$ positivity. Therefore, the confirmed LoD for Entamoeba histolytica target is 12 orgs/mL stool for both FecalSwab and unpreserved specimens, corresponding to the lowest target level to achieve $\ge 9 5 \%$ positivity.

The LoD determination and confirmation positivity rates obtained for each Cryptosporidium parvum level tested are reported in Table 5. The LoD determination step identified 961 orgs/mL stool as the initial Cryptosporidium parvum LoD for both FecalSwab and unpreserved specimens, which corresponded to the lowest target level to achieve $100 \%$ positivity. The initial LoD (961 orgs/mL stool) tested for the LoD confirmation step obtained a positivity rate below $9 5 \%$ . The second level tested for LoD confirmation (4805 orgs/mL stool) obtained a positivity rate of $100 \%$ for both FecalSwab and unpreserved specimens. Therefore, the confirmed LoD for Cryptosporidium parvum target is 4805 orgs/mL stool for both FecalSwab and unpreserved specimens, corresponding to the lowest target level to achieve $\ge 9 5 \%$ positivity.

In summary the study confirmed LoD for each of the three target organisms, Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Giardia lamblia, for the BD MAX EPP assay with FecalSwab specimens. The study demonstrated that there is a similar analytical sensitivity for detection of all targets when spiked into the FecalSwab device when compared to unpreserved specimen run in parallel. The LoD values for each target in the FecalSwab specimen was also similar to the LoD values from unpreserved stool specimen in the original submission K143648.

7. Assay Cut-Off:

Assay cut-offs remain unchanged from previously cleared versions of the BD MAX EPP (K14143648).

8. Accuracy (Instrument): Not Applicable

9. Carry-Over:

Carry-over was established previously using unpreserved stool in EBP sample buffer which represents the worst-case scenario for carry-over contamination; therefore, additional studies were not necessary, please refer to K143648.

The User variability studies were carried out to determine if the preparation of the FecalSwab by different users introduces variability in the expected results for the BD MAX EPP assay. Six (6) different users prepared two (2) different FecalSwab samples from each of five (5) panel members made of one (1) negative panel member, three (3) panel members at 2x LoD, and one (1) panel member at $4 \mathrm { x } \mathrm { L o D }$ of co-spiked targets. As Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium parvum are the most prevalent targets, they were used to evaluate user variability of the BD MAX EPP assay. Once the FecalSwab samples were prepared by various users, all subsequent steps, including the transfer to SBTs from each FecalSwab, were performed by a single user. Acceptance criteria were: $100 \%$ negative results for the twelve (12) negative samples, $2 9 5 \%$ positive results for the thirty-six (36) samples tested at $2 \mathbf { x }$ LoD, and $100 \%$ positive for the twelve (12) samples tested at $4 \mathbf { x }$ LoD. All samples yielded the expected assay results. The assay results obtained for both targets in this study, Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium parvum, at each level tested are displayed in Table 7 and all conditions met acceptance criteria.

# Specimen Stability Study

The purpose of the specimen stability study was to verify the preservation of amplifiable DNA from Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia lamblia, and Entamoeba histolytica in both the FecalSwab collection device and SBT in specified storage conditions. The study was conducted through the storage of prepared positive and negative samples at specified temperatures and subsequent assay of the samples at selected stability test points using the BD MAX System and the BD MAX EPP assay. In order to be consistent with the storage conditions recommended in the current BD MAX EPP assay package insert for the two previously validated specimen types (unpreserved (UNP) and $10 \%$ Formalin), BD performed specimen stability testing to demonstrate that FecalSwab specimens were capable of being stored at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 48 hours or at $5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 120 hours (5 days) prior to testing. BD also confirmed that BD MAX EPP sample buffer tubes (SBTs) inoculated with FecalSwab specimens can be stored under these same conditions prior to or after the prewarm step required for parasite testing as indicated in the labeling following a nested study protocol.

To confirm the stability of samples in FecalSwab media under the same conditions as current specimen claims, specimens were tested at baseline, after storage at each of the claimed conditions. Both positive and negative specimens were tested, with positive specimens being FecalSwab tubes containing pooled negative stool matrix spiked with a multiplex mixture containing target analytes at $3 \times$ the assay LoD. Four positive FecalSwab tubes and one negative FecalSwab tube from each of three lots were prepared for each time point, and two BD MAX Sample Buffer Tubes were prepared from each FecalSwab tube. Therefore, a minimum of 24 test results for positive specimens and six valid test results for negative specimens were required at each test point. The nested stability protocol was to establish stability of FecalSwab specimens after being transferred to the BD MAX EPP SBTs in two separate arms. The first part evaluated the stability of inoculated sample buffer tubes stored under the claimed stability conditions prior to the pre-warm processing step, while the second part evaluated stability of the inoculated SBTs stored under the claimed stability conditions after completion of the pre-warm step. All test points and storage conditions are shown in Table 8. Specimens were created by spiking BD MAX EPP targets (Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia lamblia, and Entamoeba histolytica) into one clinical stool pool previously determined to be negative for all BD MAX EPP targets. The stock concentrations, unpreserved LoD concentration, and 3x LoD are shown in Table 9.

\*The SBTs from Test Points 9, 10, 19 and 20 were stored 12 hours at $5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ before starting the pre-Warm step, due to delayed availability of required equipment (pre-Warm stations). Since the additional storage time for conditions 9, 10, 19 and 20 represents a worst case compared to the original Test Points described in the protocol and is within the storage conditions included in BD MAX EPP package insert, there is no impact on the study.

Acceptance criteria for FecalSwab specimens tested at baseline included the following:

$100 \%$ detection for all targets in spiked samples, and $0 \%$ detection for all targets (except the SPC internal control) in negative samples.

For all subsequent test points, the acceptance criteria were as follows:

• $2 9 5 \%$ detection for all targets in spiked samples, and $0 \%$ detection for all targets (except the SPC internal control) in negative samples

For each time point, it was required that there be a minimum of 24 valid results for positive and 6 valid results for negative samples. All results/test points passed the acceptance criteria and demonstrate that FecalSwab specimens were capable of being stored at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 48 hours or at $5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 120 hours (5 days) prior to testing. BD also confirmed that BD MAX EPP sample buffer tubes (SBTs) inoculated with FecalSwab specimens can be stored under these same conditions prior to or after the pre-warm step required for parasite testing as indicated in the labeling for the previously cleared assay, K143648.

2. Matrix Comparison: Not Applicable

# C Clinical Studies:

# 1. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:

The clinical studies were done to demonstrate clinical agreement between the FecalSwab specimen type and the unpreserved stool specimen type for the BD Max EPP targets by using positive percent agreement (PPA) (sensitivity) and negative percent agreement (NPA) with an expected point estimate of at least $9 5 \%$ for each target compared to the original reference method algorithm for unpreserved stool in K143648. The main objective of this study was to estimate the rate of unresolved (UNR) results that occur due to sample processing control (SPC) failure and to estimate the rates of indeterminate (IND) results for FecalSwab stool. The non-reportable rate (UNR/IND) for FecalSwab stool samples should not be more than $5 \%$ .

In the study design, the prospective collection and testing protocols utilized fresh, unpreserved remnant stool specimens from patients suspected of acute gastroenteritis, enteritis, or colitis. The prospective collections were only used to estimate the rate of unresolved (UNR) results, as well as to estimate the rates of indeterminate (IND) and incomplete (INC) results for a FecalSwab stool sample.

The retrospective collection and testing protocols utilized previously characterized unpreserved retrospective stool specimens from subjects suspected of acute gastroenteritis, enteritis, or colitis, and these specimens were stored frozen or at $4 - 8 \ { } ^ { \circ } { \mathrm { C } }$ . The goal of the retrospective collection was to achieve 100 positive specimens on the BD MAX EPP assay across all targets by supplementing the enrollment with samples collected. Contrived samples were only used to demonstrate clinical agreement between the FecalSwab specimen type and the unpreserved stool specimen type for the BD MAX EPP targets as the primary objective. Specimen collection was performed at select external sites and the testing occurred at the BD internal R&D laboratory.

The prospective collection protocol, utilized fresh, unpreserved remnant stool specimens from patients suspected of acute gastroenteritis, enteritis, or colitis. Fresh, prospective collection was performed at six (6) external sites. Samples collected were utilized in the testing protocol for the exploratory objective. The prospective specimen collection site used a protocol using the following steps on each specimen enrolled in the study.

The FecalSwab collection device was used to transfer a portion of the specimen into the FecalSwab tube, vortexed per user instructions, and then $1 5 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the FecalSwab tube contents were pipetted into a properly labeled BD MAX EPP Sample Buffer Tube. The BD MAX EPP user instructions were used to directly transfer a portion of the unpreserved stool specimen to a properly labeled BD MAX EPP Sample Buffer Tube. Both BD MAX EPP Sample Buffer Tubes were then shipped to BD for specimen testing under the study test protocol.

Upon receipt at the BD testing laboratory, the FecalSwab specimens in the BD MAX EPP Sample Buffer Tubes were tested as instructed. The Unpreserved Stool specimens were processed through the pre-warm step and then frozen for future testing. The results from evaluation of the prospectively collected specimens were used to calculate the non-reportable rates.

The retrospective collection protocol enrolled previously characterized unpreserved remnant stool specimens from subjects suspected of acute gastroenteritis, enteritis, or colitis, and

these specimens were stored frozen or at $4 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . There were two (2) external sites that utilized this retrospective protocol. Additional frozen retrospective samples from the previous clinical study already at the testing facility, and contrived samples were also enrolled, where applicable. Another protocol had enrolled fresh, unpreserved remnant stool specimens from patients suspected of acute gastroenteritis, enteritis, or colitis, and the remnant specimens obtained during that clinical study and have been stored frozen. Retrospective and contrived samples were evaluated under the testing protocol to evaluate the primary objective (to demonstrate clinical agreement between the FecalSwab specimen type and the unpreserved stool specimen type for the BD MAX EPP targets).

For testing of the retrospective samples, each frozen or refrigerated, unpreserved remnant specimen was brought to room temperature and tested using the BD MAX EPP assay per manufacturer's instructions by an internal BD R&D team. If the result from this test was concordant with the historical result provided by the vendor or the previous study result, then the unpreserved stool was provided to the BD Clinical Team. Per FDA guidance from previous communications, if the unpreserved BD MAX EPP assay result was discordant with the historical result, then the unpreserved specimen was tested 2 more times using the BD MAX EPP assay and a 2-out-of-3 algorithm applied to obtain truth. Once the "truth" of the unpreserved stool specimen had been established, it was provided to the BD Clinical team for FecalSwab preparation and testing. The unpreserved stool was transferred to a FecalSwab device, and that material was then pipetted into an EPP-labeled SBT and tested with the BD MAX EPP assay by the Clinical Team. The EPP FecalSwab result was compared to the final unpreserved specimen result. The same testing procedure was applied to retrospective specimens.

Since the workflow for all specimen types (Unpreserved or FecalSwab) is identical after the specimens are placed into the SBT, BD MAX analysis (testing of the SBT on the BD MAX system) was performed internally (BD R&D laboratory). Additionally, previous clinical studies for the BD MAX EPP (K143648) Assays have demonstrated that the variability between reagent lots, MAX instruments, and users do not impact the results of the assay. The BD MAX EPP assay was performed according to the clinical trial package insert, BD MAX. Instrument Manual and the Clinical Trial Training Manual. All runs were performed by trained employees who demonstrated proficiency prior to testing. The BD MAX / FecalSwab Study compliant external control rate is summarized in Table 10.

Any sample included in a run in which an external control failed, or any sample for which an Unresolved, Indeterminate, or Incomplete result was obtained, was retested from the same Sample Buffer Tube along with valid external controls. If any targets of the panel have an unresolved or indeterminate result, then the result of the combined assay was defined as "non-reportable".

In addition to these specimens, contrived specimens were prepared for Entamoeba histolytica. $50 \%$ of the contrived specimens were to be prepared at $1 . 5 \mathrm { x } - 2 \mathrm { x }$ LoD in a unique (not pooled) specimen matrix consisting of a single negative stool specimen and collected using the FecalSwab. A total of 53 positive and 53 negative specimens were prepared using 53 unique negative specimen matrices that had been previously determined to be negative for all targeted analytes, per FDA request shown in Table 12.

The overall PPA and NPA for the FecalSwab compared to the current unpreserved specimen collection is provided in Table 13. The NPA acceptance criteria were met for all target organisms in the retrospective testing. However, Cryptosporidium ( $C .$ hominis and $C .$ . parvum only) and Entamoeba histolytica did not meet the expected PPA performance, either with a PPA point estimate under $9 5 \%$ or with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval around the PPA estimate extending below $90 \%$ . Giardia lamblia met the expected PPA point estimate but the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval around the PPA estimate extended below $90 \%$ .

In summary, the unexpected results arise from the low prevalence of positive specimens observed for the targets and target concentrations near or below the LoD.

Individual organism’s data comparisons are shown below. The data in Table 14 demonstrates that although the PPA lower bound for Giardia lamblia extends below $90 \%$ , the performance of the FecalSwab specimens is comparable with the performance of the unpreserved specimens. As all specimens with discrepant results have the target at or near the LoD based on Ct values, the degree of variability observed here is not surprising. In addition, the number of positive specimens in the study was less than the target number $( \sim 1 0 0$ positive samples), which results in wider confidence intervals.

Cryptosporidium (C. hominis and $C .$ . parvum only) met the FDA's expected NPA performance goal (NPA: $9 9 . 8 \%$ ( $9 5 \%$ CI: $9 9 . 1 \%$ , $1 0 0 . 0 \% )$ ). Cryptosporidium ( $C .$ hominis and C. parvum only) had a $9 0 . 9 \%$ PPA with a $9 5 \%$ CI of $8 4 . 1 \% - 9 5 . 0 \%$ that does not meet the FDA's expected PPA performance goal $( { \ge } 9 5 \%$ with the lower bound of the two-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence interval exceeding $90 \%$ ). As described in Table 15, there were ten samples that were unpreserved Positive (POS) and FecalSwab Negative (NEG) and one sample that was unpreserved Negative (NEG) and FecalSwab Positive (POS). All discrepant samples were at or near the LoD. Stool samples with low target loads (at or near the LoD) have a higher probability of not being detected due to insufficient target DNA delivery to the PCR cartridge. Therefore, the likelihood of reproducible positive/negative results for samples near or at the LoD is variable. Additionally, three of the discrepant samples required 2-out-of-3 testing due to this variability at or near LoD.

Entamoeba histolytica met the FDA's desirable NPA performance goal (NPA: $1 0 0 . 0 \%$ $9 5 \%$ CI: $9 9 . 5 \%$ , $1 0 0 . 0 \% )$ ). Entamoeba histolytica had $8 0 . 0 \%$ PPA with a $9 5 \%$ CI of $3 7 . 6 \%$ - $9 6 . 4 \%$ , that does not meet the FDA's desirable PPA performance goal $( \geq 9 5 \%$ with the lower bound of the two-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence interval exceeding $90 \%$ ). As described in Table 16, there was one sample that was unpreserved Positive (POS) and FecalSwab Negative (NEG). The one discrepant sample was below the LoD. Stool samples with low target loads (at or near the LoD) have a higher probability of not being detected due to insufficient target DNA delivery to the PCR cartridge. Therefore, the likelihood of reproducible positive/negative results for samples near or at the LoD is variable. In addition, since the positive sample size was low, contrived testing was performed and met the FDA's desirable performance goal with no discrepant results (Table 17).

The data demonstrates that although the PPA is lower than the expected $9 5 \%$ -point estimate, and the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval around that estimate extends below $90 \%$ for Entamoeba histolytica, the performance of the FecalSwab specimens is comparable with the performance of the unpreserved specimens. As all specimens with discrepant results have the target at or near the LoD based on Ct values, the degree of variability observed here is not surprising. In addition, the number of positive specimens in the study was less than the target number $( \sim 1 0 0$ positive samples), which results in wider confidence intervals.

In conclusion, the evidence provided herein indicates that the FecalSwab specimen type performs comparably to the currently market authorized unpreserved specimen type. The observation that some of the assay targets had a PPA point estimate or confidence interval around the PPA estimate that were lower than FDA's expected performance is due to either low prevalence of positive specimens or specimens containing target organisms at or below the LoD. For Entamoeba histolytica that had few positive specimens, contrived testing was performed and met the FDA's desirable performance goal $( \geq 9 5 \%$ with the lower bound of the two-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence interval exceeding $90 \%$ ), further supporting the claim that FecalSwab performance is substantially equivalent to performance of the current unpreserved specimen collection when tested on BD MAX EPP assay. All discrepant samples across all targets are consistent with low titer specimens at or near the limit of detection of the BD MAX EPP on the BD MAX System. Additionally, the exploratory objective of this study met the acceptance criteria with a nonreportable rate (NRR) of $\leq 5 \%$ (Table 18).
