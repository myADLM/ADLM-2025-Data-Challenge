The disposable tube device sustains the viability of organisms during transport for up to $4 8 \ \mathrm { h r s }$ . at $2 { - } 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $2 2 { - } 2 5 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { C } .$ .There are two main tube types (round and conical bottom), and four configurations by volume of urine for the round bottom tubes (4 ml, 7 ml, $8 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ , $1 0 \mathrm { m l }$ ). The conical bottom tubes only have one configuration by volume $( 8 ~ \mathrm { m l } )$ ). Each volume is available in yellow and white caps. The different device configurations and information on the amount of preservative contained in each tube is provided in table 1.

# B Principle of Operation:

The Disposable Urine Collection Tube system is used to safely collect and transport urine from collection sites to the testing laboratories. It is intended to be used by health care professionals. The vacuum in the collection tube allows autofill the urine sample through the puncture needle and the boric acid in the tubes prevents overgrowth of uropathogenic bacteria and yeasts.

2. Linearity: Not Applicable

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference: Not Applicable

4. Assay Reportable Range: Not Applicable

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

Stability Verification Report:

The shelf life for the Disposable Urine Collection Tube was determined to be 18 months from the date of manufacture when stored in well-ventilated clean room with the environment of relative humidity not more than $80 \%$ and at temperature $2 2 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The shelf life of the Disposable Urine Collection Tube was evaluated using real-time aging performance test at time points $\mathrm { T } = 0$ , 6, 12 and 18 months. At each time point, the following performance tests were conducted as described below:

Appearance test was carried out by inspecting visually for clear label, transparent PET tube and any sign of deformation or breakage.   
• Vacuum test was performed by measuring volume drawn into the Disposable Urine Collection Tube between 90 to $1 1 0 \%$ of the nominal liquid capacity allowed.   
• Physical and mechanical performance tests included leak test, strength test, and a 50 KPa pressure test. Mechanical stress test was conducted by checking the tubes could withstand centrifugation.   
• The strength test, and urine collection volume capacity test were carried out as part of the evaluation. Sterility test and the standard of boric acid content used were also assessed. The package integrity was evaluated by visually checking for any changes or damage to the package. Six lots of varying production were used for the studies and results showed that all samples passed the real time aging test for 18 months at $2 2 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

All the results were acceptable and support the claim that the Disposable Urine Collection Tube is physically or visually stable for 18 months.

# Sterilization:

The Disposable Urine Collection Tubes were sterilized by electron beam radiation with an average dose of $2 0 \mathrm { k G y }$ to achieve a sterility assurance level (SAL) of $1 0 ^ { - 6 }$ with a dosimeter attached to monitor dosage through the sterilization process. Sterilization was validated following ISO 11137-1: 2006 and ISO 11137-2: 2013 Sterilization of Health Care Products Radiation guidelines. Sterility test was carried out according to ISO11137-2:2009 Medical Devices Radiation Sterilization-Microbiological Methods-Part 2. In this sterility test, 100 samples after irradiated at the verification dose were inoculated with $2 0 0 \mathrm { m l }$ soybean casein liquid medium and incubated at $3 0 { \pm } 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 14 days. The results were observed with no growth. Sterilization studies of the tube were acceptable.

# Microbial Recovery Studies:

Microbial recovery (viability) studies were conducted to support the claim of the Disposable Urine Collection Tube for the collection, transport and preservation of urine specimens from the collection site to the testing laboratory. Sample panels were prepared from the listed bacteria and yeast (below) that were commonly associated with urinary tract infections. Cultures from $1 . 5 \times 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ (equivalent $0 . 5 \mathrm { M c F }$ arland standard) were diluted into the pooled human negative clinical urine matrix to give a final concentration of $1 . 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 2 } \mathrm { C F U } / \mathrm { m l } .$ . The appropriate volume of urine samples spiked with each organism was introduced into the Disposable Urine Collection Tubes. Three lots of the Disposable Urine Collection Tubes with three samples per lot were evaluated for the microbial recovery (viability) assay. The inoculated sample tubes were initially tested to establish a time point zero then stored at 2- $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and $2 2 \mathrm { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h r s } .$ ., and $4 8 \ \mathrm { h r s }$ . After each storage time and temperature, the samples were plated to grow colonies which were counted to determine $\mathrm { C F U / m l }$ for each time points. According to CLSI document M40-A2, the acceptance criteria for microbial recovery method was set to be within $1 \log _ { 1 0 }$ of the initial microorganism count. Results of recovery studies are presented in table 2.

# Fill Volume Impact Recovery Study:

A fill volume impact recovery study was performed to demonstrate that underfilling of Disposable Urine Collection Tube containing preservative does not negatively impact the viability of urine microorganism. Sample panels were prepared by listed microorganisms (below) diluted from $1 . 5 \mathrm { \ : x \ : 1 0 ^ { 8 } \ : C F U / m L }$ (equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard) into the pooled human urine matrix to give a final concentration of $1 . 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 2 } \mathrm { C F U / m l }$ . Three production lots were tested in three replicates with each urine samples spiked with $E .$ . coli, $P$ . aeruginosa or $P$ . mirabilis at the sample fill volume of $90 \%$ and $1 1 0 \%$ . The inoculated sample tubes were initially tested to establish a time point zero then stored at $2 2 \mathrm { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 48 hrs. After the storage time, the samples were plated to grow colonies which were counted to determine $\mathrm { C F U / m l }$ for each time points. The acceptance criteria for the study is less than 1 $\log _ { 1 0 }$ change when the fill volume is above or below the line. The results were shown in table 3.
