# D Special Instrument Requirements:

VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems, VITEK 2 Systems (PC) version 9.04

# A Device Description:

VITEK 2 AST-GP Cefoxitin Screen is designed to predict mecA-mediated oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus spp. The cefoxitin screen and oxacillin work in combination to determine the final interpretation reported for oxacillin. The VITEK 2 AST-GP Cefoxitin Screen is a qualitative test based on the CLSI, “Disk Diffusion Test for Prediction of mecA mediated resistance in Staphylococci.” The VITEK 2 AST-GP Cefoxitin Screen test is intended for use with the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems as a laboratory aid in the determination of in vitro susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.

The VITEK 2 card is inoculated with a standardized organism suspension, and growth inside the card is optically monitored throughout the incubation cycle. Results are automatically calculated once a predetermined growth threshold is reached and a report is generated that contains the MIC result and the interpretive category result.

VITEK 2 AST-GP Cefoxitin Screen has the following concentrations in the card: 4 and 5 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ ).

# B Principle of Operation:

The VITEK 2 AST card is essentially a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling dilution technique. Each VITEK 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials combined with the nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with $0 . 4 5 \%$ to $0 . 5 0 \%$ saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System will automatically dilute the bacterial suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then the VITEK 2 will fill, seal and place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing and loading operation.

The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time (up to 24 hours for Streptococcus species). The analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based on attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the antimicrobial agent. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated. For the VITEK 2 Cefoxitin Screen, the report will list either a positive or negative result. The VITEK 2 Cefoxitin Screen and oxacillin work in combination to determine the final oxacillin interpretation based on the CLSI recommendations.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility testing for the VITEK 2 AST-GP Cefoxitin Screen was conducted at three clinical sites using a panel of ten Staphylococcus spp. (i.e., five S. aureus, three $S .$ . epidermidis, one S. haemolyticus and one S. saprophyticus isolates). Each isolate was tested in triplicate over three days for a total of 270 data points. Inocula were prepared using both the auto-dilution and manual dilution methods for testing in the VITEK 2 System. In addition, the inocula were prepared by the manual dilution method for use with the VITEK 2 Compact. The data was analyzed as described in the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems. The testing resulted in overall reproducibility of $100 \%$ for each dilution method and VITEK 2 system, which is acceptable.

# Quality Control (QC) Testing

The QC strains, namely Staphylococcus aureus BAA-1026 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, are not CLSI-recommended for routine QC for detection of methicillin (oxacillin) resistance but have been evaluated and determined to be acceptable. Each QC strain was tested a sufficient number of times (i.e., at least 20/site) at each testing site using both the VITEK 2 AST-GP Cefoxitin Screen Test and the CLSI test for detecting methicillin (oxacillin) resistance with cefoxitin disk diffusion. Both the automatic dilution and manual dilution methods were used for the VITEK 2 and the manual dilution method was used for the VITEK 2 Compact. The results are summarized in Table 1 below.

Both the auto-dilution and the manual dilution methods for VITEK 2 and the manual dilution for VITEK 2 Compact generated expected QC results $59 5 \%$ of the time, which is acceptable.

One ancillary quality control organism (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923) was tested throughout the comparative testing by Cefoxitin disk diffusion to perform further quality control of the Cefoxitin disk. Expected QC results for the Cefoxitin disk diffusion method were generated $100 \%$ (147/147) of the time.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A clinical study was conducted at five clinical sites using the VITEK 2 AST-GP Cefoxitin Screen. There were 739 clinical isolates and 75 challenge isolates tested for a total of 814 isolates. Results obtained with the VITEK 2 AST-GP Cefoxitin Screen Test were compared to the qualitative values determined by the CLSI test for detecting methicillin (oxacillin) resistance using cefoxitin disk diffusion as a surrogate test. The testing conditions for the cefoxitin disk diffusion method consisted of the following:

• Medium – Mueller Hinton agar with Cefoxitin $3 0 ~ \mu \ g$ disks Inoculum – Direct colony suspension Incubation – S. aureus and S. lugdunensis: $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ; 16-18 hours. Other Staphylococcus spp. (excluding $S .$ . pseudintermedius and S. scheiferi: $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ; 24 hours (may be reported after 18 hours, if resistant)

The VITEK 2 AST cards were inoculated with test organisms using the auto-dilution method (VITEK 2) and manual dilution method (VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact). All test inocula used for the VITEK 2 AST cards and the cefoxitin disk diffusion method were standardized using the DensiCHEK Plus instrument.

A total of 743 clinical Staphylococcus spp. isolates were evaluated at five sites: $6 6 . 2 \%$ were considered contemporary isolates (isolated from clinical specimen and tested within 6 months) and $3 3 . 8 \%$ were stock isolates. Complete test results are available for 739 clinical isolates ( $4 5 3 \mathrm { ~ S ~ }$ aureus, $1 3 S .$ . capitis, $1 8 5 \ : S .$ . epidermidis, $1 9 S .$ haemolyticus, $2 0 S .$ . lugdunensis, $2 0 S .$ saprophyticus, $1 4 S .$ . simulans and $1 5 S .$ . warneri). All clinical isolates were tested with the auto-dilution option of the VITEK 2.

A total of 75 challenge Staphylococcus spp. isolates (1 Coagulase negative staphylococcus, $5 5 \ : S .$ . aureus, $1 0 S .$ . epidermidis, $4 S .$ haemolyticus, 4 S. lugdunensis, and $1 \ S .$ simulans) were evaluated at one site. The challenge set was tested with the auto-dilution and manual dilution options of the VITEK 2 and with the manual dilution method on the VITEK 2 Compact.

# Clinical and Challenge Data –VITEK 2 Auto-Dilution

VITEK 2 AST-GP Cefoxitin Screen performance was determined with 814 isolates (739 clinical isolates and 75 challenge isolates) by comparing VITEK 2 results with cefoxitin disk diffusion results that were evaluated based on susceptibility testing interpretive criteria (breakpoints) established for Staphylococcus spp. A final VITEK 2 result for oxacillin was determined by comparison of the Cefoxitin Screen Test card result and the Oxacillin card result using forcing rules. Oxacillin is forced susceptible for coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) other than S. lugdunensis and S. epidermidis when the oxacillin MIC result is $0 . 5 - 2 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ and the cefoxitin screen result is negative. This rule was used in the final analysis of the result. After forcing, category agreement and error rates were calculated using Cefoxitin disk diffusion as the comparator method.
