To obtain a substantial equivalence determination for both the BioFire Global Fever Panel and the BIOFIRE SHIELD Control Kit for the Global Fever Panel on the FilmArray Torch instrument system.

# B Measurand:

The BioFire Global Fever Panel detects and identifies the following pathogens: Chikungunya virus, Dengue virus, Leptospira spp., and Plasmodium spp., including species differentiation between $P _ { - }$ . falciparum and $P .$ . vivax/ovale.

# C Type of Test:

The BioFire Global Fever Panel is a multiplexed nucleic acid-based test for the detection and identification of six pathogens which cause acute febrile illness (AFI) from whole blood specimens on BioFire FilmArray systems.

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

# A Intended Use(s):

BioFire Global Fever Panel Intended Use:

The BioFire Global Fever Panel is a qualitative, multiplexed, nucleic acid-based in vitro diagnostic test intended for use with BioFire FilmArray 2.0 and BioFire FilmArray Torch Systems. The BioFire Global Fever Panel detects and identifies selected bacterial, viral, and protozoan nucleic acids directly from EDTA whole blood collected from individuals with signs and/or symptoms of acute febrile illness or recent acute febrile illness and known or suspected exposure to the following target pathogens: chikungunya virus, dengue virus (serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4), Leptospira spp., and Plasmodium spp. (including species differentiation of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax/ovale). Evaluation for more common causes of acute febrile illness (e.g., infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract or gastroenteritis, as well as noninfectious causes) should be considered prior to evaluation with this panel. Results are meant to be used in conjunction with other clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory data, in accordance with the guidelines provided by the relevant public health authorities.

Positive results do not rule out co-infections with pathogens not included on the BioFire Global Fever Panel. Not all pathogens that cause acute febrile illness are detected by this test, and negative results do not rule out the presence of other infections. In the United States, patient travel history and consultation of the CDC Yellow Book should be considered prior to use of the BioFire Global Fever Panel as some pathogens are more common in certain geographical locations.

BIOFIRE SHIELD Control Kit for the BioFire Global Fever Panel Intended Use:

The BIOFIRE SHIELD Control Kit for the BioFire Global Fever Panel contains Positive and Negative External Controls intended for use as assayed quality controls to monitor the performance of in vitro diagnostic laboratory nucleic acid testing procedures for the qualitative detection of chikungunya virus, dengue virus (serotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4), Leptospira spp., and Plasmodium spp. (including species differentiation of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax/ovale) when using the BioFire Global Fever Panel on BioFire FilmArray 2.0 and BioFire FilmArray Torch Systems. The BIOFIRE SHIELD Control Kit for the BioFire Global Fever Panel is designed for and intended to be used solely with the BioFire Global Fever Panel. This product does not replace manufacturer internal controls provided as part of the BioFire Global Fever Panel device.

Both the Positive and Negative External Controls are provided in a FilmArray Control Injection Vial format. The Positive Control Injection Vial contains dried synthetic DNA segments in buffer and stabilizer to assess the presence of each individual assay on the BioFire Global Fever Panel. The Negative Control Injection Vial contains no DNA and is non-reactive with the BioFire Global Fever Panel assays.

B Indication(s) for Use: Same as intended use.

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Rx - For Prescription Use Only

For in vitro diagnostic use only.

# D Special Instrument Requirements:

The FilmArray Global Fever Panel and the BIOFIRE SHIELD Control Kit for the BioFire Global Fever Panel are for use with the FilmArray 2.0 or FilmArray Torch instrument systems.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The BioFire Global Fever Panel is a multiplexed nucleic acid-based test for the detection and identification of six pathogens which cause acute febrile illness (AFI) from whole blood specimens on BioFire FilmArray systems. The BioFire Global Fever Panel detects and identifies the following pathogens: chikungunya virus, dengue virus, Leptospira spp., and Plasmodium spp., including species differentiation between $P .$ . falciparum and $P .$ . vivax/ovale. The FilmArray Global Fever Panel simultaneously conducts six tests for the identification of bacterial, viral, and protozoan organisms from whole blood specimens collected in EDTA tubes. Results from the FilmArray Global Fever Panel are available within about one hour.

The BioFire Global Fever Panel was previously cleared under DEN200043 for use with BioFire FilmArray 2.0 systems. Please refer to DEN200043 for additional information regarding the BioFire Global Fever Panel. In this 510(k) submission, the FilmArray Torch system is being added as an additional instrument system for use with the BioFire Global Fever Panel. The FilmArray Torch is a modular configuration of the FilmArray 2.0 that minimizes instrument footprint by stacking up to twelve individual FilmArray Torch Modules on top of a single FilmArray Torch System Base.

The BIOFIRE SHIELD Control Kit for the BioFire Global Fever Panel is an assayed quality control intended for monitoring the diagnostic performance of the BioFire Global Fever Panel. The Control Kit consists of Positive and Negative External Controls in a FilmArray Control Injection Vial format. The Positive External Control contains external assayed quality control material consisting of a set of non-infectious DNA segments dried on the filter of a FilmArray Control Injection Vial and detected by the Global Fever Panel. Analysis of the controls is carried out by specific pouch modules that are included in the BioFire Global Fever Panel Pouch Module Package. The Positive External Control has been optimized to be detected by all pathogen assays contained in the Global Fever Panel (Table 1). The Negative External Control contains no nucleic acid, and a successful run will be negative for all assays on the panel. These controls are not intended to replace the internal FilmArray Global Fever Panel pouch controls (RNA process control and second stage PCR array control). The Global Fever Panel External Control Kit contains no biological hazards and is $100 \%$ non-infectious.

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

Performance of the BioFire Global Fever Panel on BioFire FilmArray Torch System

A reproducibility study was performed to establish equivalent analyte detection of the BioFire Global Fever Panel on the BioFire FilmArray 2.0 and FilmArray Torch systems. Reproducibility of BioFire Global Fever Panel test results between the two instrument systems was directly compared. The study incorporated potential variation introduced by different instruments (three), days (five), replicates (six), systems/modules, and reagent kit lots. The site variable was simulated using three different FilmArray Torch and three different FilmArray 2.0 systems.

Briefly, three contrived whole blood samples were prepared with different mixtures of panel analytes: Leptospira interrogans, dengue virus, and Plasmodium falciparum. For each analyte, one sample was spiked at a Moderate Positive $\left( 3 { \times } \mathrm { L o D } \right)$ level, another sample at a Low Positive $\left( 1 \times \mathrm { L o D } \right)$ level, and the third sample was not spiked (negative). Six aliquots (replicates) of each sample were tested on each system on five different days, providing a total of 90 replicate test results per sample per FilmArray platform. On each test day, two operators per system used three FilmArray 2.0 instruments and three FilmArray Torch modules; three BioFire Global Fever Panel pouch reagent lots were rotated daily.

Reproducibility was assessed by comparing the observed test results (Detected/Not Detected) to the expected test results (Detected for spiked samples, Not Detected for unspiked samples). The overall agreement between observed and expected results for the FilmArray 2.0 platform was $9 9 . 4 \%$ and the overall agreement for the FilmArray Torch platform was $9 8 . 9 \%$ . Detection rates and percent agreement between observed and expected test results are shown in Table 2 below.

1 There was one unexpected dengue virus Detected result for the FilmArray Torch platform for an overall agreement of $9 8 . 9 \%$ (89/90). The unexpected dengue virus Detected result may have been the result of contamination introduced during sample preparation, handling, and/or sample loading.

A second assessment of reproducibility was conducted based on variability in the melt temperature $\mathrm { ( T m ) }$ of the amplification products measured as standard deviation. Variability in the melt temperatures for the assays evaluated with both FilmArray Platforms was within the expected range $( { \leq } 0 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for each simulated site, the Tm standard deviation varying between $0 . 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $0 . 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C . N }$ elt temperature means, standard deviations, and coefficient of variation (CV) are shown in Table 3 below.

BioFire FilmArray 2.0 and Torch Systems met the reproducibility acceptance criteria showing an overall agreement between expected and observed results of $2 9 5 \%$ , and Tm variability of $\underline { { < } } 0 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Performance of the BIOFIRE SHIELD Control Kit for the BioFire Global Fever Panel on BioFire FilmArray Torch System

Performance of the BIOFIRE SHIELD Control Kit on the BioFire FilmArray 2.0 system was established in K202382. Reproducibility of the BIOFIRE SHIELD Control Kit on the BioFire FilmArray Torch platform was evaluated by testing Positive External Controls and Negative External Controls on three BioFire FilmArray Torch systems. Testing included two operators per system for a total of 135 replicates for each control type over five days. Reproducibility was evaluated by calculating the percent agreement between observed test results (Passed or Failed) and expected test results (Passed) for both negative and positive SHIELD controls. The expected percent agreement for controls was $9 9 . 6 \%$ . Results are summarized in Table 4 below.

1 All Global Fever Panel assays have a positive amplicon melt in the PEC melt range. 2 All Global Fever Panel assays have no melt in both the PEC melt range and in the organism/virus melt range. 3One single unexpected dengue virus Detected result was observed for a Negative External Control on System 1. The failure was due to detection of Positive External Control amplicon and may been due to contamination with Positive External Control during control preparation and pouch loading.
