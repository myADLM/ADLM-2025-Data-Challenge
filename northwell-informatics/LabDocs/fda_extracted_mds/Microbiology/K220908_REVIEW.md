# A Device Description:

The EnTM Collection and Transport System medium consists of a polypropylene conical tube filled with $2 \mathrm { m l }$ of the transport medium (pale brown to red color medium solution), affixed with a polyethylene screw cap. The bottom part of the tube has a self-standing shape. Tubes are provided in a paper rack. The media tubes can be provided with one or two kinds of sterile specimen collection swabs, one for oropharyngeal (OP) oral use and the other nasopharyngeal (NP) for nasal use. The swab shaft is polystyrene with a breaking point, and the swab tip is flocked nylon fibers. The media is provided in two different configurations with and without the sterile peel pouch containing swabs as shown below:

# B Principle of Operation:

The EnTM Collection and Transport System is an osmotically balanced and buffered medium that contains Hank’s balanced salt solution. Also, the medium contains a $\mathsf { p H }$ indicator, a protein stabilizer, sucrose as a preservative and antibiotics to prevent contamination from bacteria or fungi. The EnTM Collection and Transport System is used to safely collect and transport upper respiratory viruses from collection sites to the testing laboratories. It is intended to be used by health care professionals.

After collecting a specimen using the swab, the swab is placed into the uncapped polypropylene tube filled with $2 \mathrm { m L }$ of the transport medium, the swab shaft is broken off at the breakpoint by hand and the tube is capped closed. The swab specimen can be stored in the collection medium for up to 48 hours at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . The swab specimen is ready for use in diagnostic to determine the presence of a target pathogen. Sample collection is performed by health care professionals.

# VI Standards/Guidance Documents Referenced:

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility: Not Applicable

2. Linearity: Not Applicable

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference: Not Applicable

4. Assay Reportable Range: Not Applicable

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

Shelf-life stability: The shelf life for the EnTM Collection and Transport System was determined to be 12 months from the date of manufacture when stored at temperatures $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . The shelf life of the EnTM Collection and Transport Medium was evaluated using real-time aging performance test.

Physical Stability: Physical stability was evaluated by Appearance, UV spectrum analysis (Scan: absorbance at $2 5 0 { - } 8 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m } )$ , and $\mathsf { p H }$ measurement at time points $\mathrm { T } = 0$ , 6, and 12 months using three lots stored at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . The appearance was evaluated by inspecting visually to examine for a red and clear solution (translucent with no turbidity). Appearance results were acceptable for all lots at all storage times. To detect any physical changes in the media, UV Spectrum analysis was conducted by setting the wavelength range to $2 5 0 { - } 8 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ (scan). The UV spectrum scanning analysis for $2 5 0 { - } 8 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ produced similar results for all lots at all storage times. Absorbance at $2 9 0 \mathrm { n m }$ was also measured for any physical changes and results showed no changes and produced similar results for all lots at all storage times. For pH measurement study, all the transport media demonstrated pH level within $7 . 4 \pm 1$ for all lots at all storage times.

Sterility test: The EnTM Collection and Transport System is not claimed to be sterile nor is it intended to be sterilized by the end user. To reduce contamination, the screw-cap tube is sterilized by irradiation with a maximum dose of $4 0 \mathrm { k G y }$ using the E-beam irradiation process. A check for possible contamination was conducted by transferring transport media to growth medium Thioglycolate and incubated $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 3 days, and in Tryptic Soy Broth at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 5 days and examined for growth turbidity. No bacterial or fungal proliferation was detected at either condition tested.

No testing was performed at lower than $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . Even though additional testing was conducted at higher temperatures $( 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ , the data was not required, and no claim was granted but the data supported stability at 12 months. The shelf-life study report supports the stability of the EnTM Collection and Transport System at room temperature $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 12 months.

# Viral Recovery:

Culture-Based Viral Recovery Study: Performance of the EnTM Collection and Transport System media was evaluated for virus viability at refrigerated temperatures $( 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . Three lots of VTM with newly manufactured, middle-aged lot and close to expiry lots were used to evaluate viral recovery (ENTM-22001, ENTM-22003, and ENTM-23001). Influenza A (California/07/2009 H1N1, NCCP 42467), Human coronavirus 229E (Zeptometrix 0810229CF), and Human respiratory syncytial virus type A (type A strain Long, ATCC VR26) were used for the viral recovery study. Each virus was diluted in pooled negative nasopharyngeal matrix transferred to the collection swab and then added to the Viral Transport Media. Aliquots of each replicate were stored at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for 0, 24, and 48 hours. Host cells (MDCK for Influenza A, MRC-5 for Human coronavirus, and HEp-2 for Human respiratory syncytial virus type A) were plated for 1 day. At each timepoint the viral samples from EnTM were serially diluted and inoculated onto the host cell-line and cultured in a 96 well plate. The plates were incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and viral CPE was observed after 4-5 days. Viral titer was determined by the Reed-Muench method calculation of $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 }$ ( $50 \%$ tissue culture infective dose).

Results were considered acceptable if the average viral titer demonstrates any percent changes within $\pm 9 0 \%$ (i.e.,1 log change). The results are presented in the Table 1. Any changes in the viral titer in the timepoints was shown as percent changes and negative percent change indicates reduction.
