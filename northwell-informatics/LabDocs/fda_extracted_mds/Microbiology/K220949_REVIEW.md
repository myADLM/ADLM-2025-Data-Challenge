# B Principle of Operation:

This assay is an automated, two-step immunoassay for the qualitative detection of IgG antibodies to CMV (anti-CMV IgG) in human serum and plasma using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology.

Pre-diluted sample, CMV virus lysate (strain AD169) coated paramagnetic microparticles, and assay diluent are combined and incubated. The anti-CMV IgG present in the sample binds to the CMV virus lysate (strain AD169) coated microparticles. The mixture is washed. Murine antihuman IgG acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to create a reaction mixture and incubated. Following a wash cycle, Pre-Trigger and Trigger Solutions are added.

The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as a relative light unit (RLU).

The presence or absence of anti-CMV IgG in the sample is determined by comparing the chemiluminescent RLU in the reaction to the cutoff RLU determined from an active calibration.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

# 1. Precision:

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the precision performance of the ARCHITECT CMV IgG assay. In addition, this study evaluated the acceptability of a calibration generated using the ARCHITECT CMV IgG assay and stored on the ARCHITECT i2000SR System for a minimum of 31 days. Precision was performed based on guidance from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document EP05-A3. The following samples were tested, Table 4:

Testing was performed using 1 instrument, 3 Reagent lots, 3 Calibrator lots, and 3 Control lots. Each reagent lot was paired with a different lot of calibrators and controls. A calibration per reagent lot was performed on the instrument by testing the calibrators in replicates of 2.

he samples were tested in a minimum of 2 replicates (from separate sample cups),

2 times per day (separated by a minimum of 2 hours), on at least 20 different days, for a minimum of 80 required measurements.

Note: Three replicates per run were tested for each sample and therefore, the total number of measurements in may be up to 120 measurements.

The nonreactive panel was CMV IgG negative human plasma. The high nonreactive panel (Panel 2), grayzone/equivocal panel (Panel 3), low reactive panel (Panel 4), moderate reactive panel (Panel 5), and high reactive panel (Panel 6) were prepared by diluting recalcified CMV IgG

positive human plasma with recalcified CMV IgG negative human plasma. The precision of the ARCHITECT CMV IgG assay was considered acceptable if the withinlaboratory imprecision (repeatability [within-run], between-run, and between-day) was

• $\leq 1 0 \ \% \mathrm { C V }$ for samples within the range of $1 5 . 0 \mathrm { A U / m L }$ to $2 5 0 . 0 \mathrm { A U / m L }$ and $\mathrm { S D } \le 0 . 6 \mathrm { A U / m L }$ for samples less than $6 . 0 \mathrm { A U / m L }$ and • $\mathrm { S D } \le 1 . 5 \mathrm { A U / m L }$ for samples between $6 . 0 \mathrm { A U / m L }$ and less than 15.0 AU/mL.

# Calibration Storage

The calibration generated using the ARCHITECT CMV IgG assay was considered acceptable if the result from each control replicate met the following specifications, when the calibration curve was stored on board the instrument for up to 31 days.

# Expected Values

Representative performance data are provided in this section. Results obtained in individual laboratories may vary.

It is recommended that each laboratory determine its own reference range based upon its particular locale and population characteristics.

Of the 989 specimens included in the ARCHITECT CMV IgG clinical study, 791 were from the intended use population in the US. Of the 791 specimens, 591 $( 7 4 . 7 \% )$ were routine order (325 female and 266 male, 0 to 91 years old) and 200 $( 2 5 . 3 \% )$ were pregnant females (19 to 45 years old). The mean age across the 791 subjects was 40 years.

The ARCHITECT CMV IgG assay was reactive in 508 $( 6 4 . 2 \% )$ of the collected specimens in the intended use population in the US $( \mathbf { n } = 7 9 1 )$ ). Testing of the specimens was performed at 3 clinical testing sites located in Indianapolis Indiana, Lewisville Texas, and Palo Alto California.

6. Detection Limit:

NA

# 7. Assay Cut-Off:

Data obtained from 530 specimens used in the OUS ARCHITECT CMV IgG verification study was used to confirm that the cutoff from the original Abbott AxSYM CMV IgG would maintain assay sensitivity in the ARCHITECT CMV IgG assay. Each sample was tested using all 3 reagent lots, on both the OUS ARCHITECT CMV IgG assay and the Abbott AxSYM CMV IgG assay (1590 samples total). AxSYM was utilized as truth. It was determined that an implementation of a lower decision limit of 6 AU/mL with an upper

decision limit of $1 5 \mathrm { \ A U / m L }$ was necessary based on this internal data for the OUS ARCHITECT CMV IgG assay. The cutoff was validated in the clinical studies performed in the US to support the substantial equivalence determination of the ARCHITECT CMV IgG assay to the predicate device.

Nonreactive: $< 6 . 0 \ : \mathrm { A U / m L }$ Grayzone/Equivocal: 6.0 to $\mathrm { < } 1 5 . 0 \mathrm { A U / m L }$ Reactive: $\geq 1 5 . 0 \mathrm { A U / m L }$

# B Comparison Studies:

# 1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A clinical study (method comparison) was performed in the US based on guidance from CLSI EP12-A2, 2nd ed. to evaluate the percent agreement between the ARCHITECT CMV IgG investigational assay and a current, FDA-cleared, commercially available anti-CMV IgG assay with routine order specimens collected in the US $\mathbf { \tilde { n } } = 5 9 1$ ) and outside of the US ( $\mathrm { n } { = } 1 9 8$ ) and specimens collected from pregnant females in the US $( \mathbf { n } = 2 0 0 )$ ).

Further evaluation of 4 specimens (3 from routine order and 1 from pregnant females) with an equivocal/grayzone result by comparator assay was performed with 2 additional current, FDAcleared, commercially available anti-CMV IgG assays.

# Clinical Testing Sites

There were three testing sites in California, Indiana, and Texas. Testing with the ARCHITECT CMV IgG assay was performed using 3 ARCHITECT i2000SR instruments (one at each external clinical testing site). Three lots of ARCHITECT CMV IgG Reagents, 2 lots of ARCHITECT CMV IgG Calibrators, and 1 lot of ARCHITECT CMV IgG Controls were used at each of the 3 external clinical testing sites. Comparator testing using the FDA cleared assay was performed at Site 1 only.

a The $9 5 \%$ confidence interval (CI) for negative percent agreement and positive percent agreement were estimated using the Wilson Score method.

b Two routine order specimens were from pregnant females and therefore, were also included in the pregnant female category.

c Of the 3 specimens that were nonreactive by ARCHITECT CMV IgG and equivocal/grayzone by comparator assay, 2 were negative and 1 was equivocal/grayzone by consensus testing. One specimen that was concordant equivocal/grayzone by ARCHITECT CMV IgG and comparator assay was negative by consensus testing.

d One specimen from pregnant females that was concordant grayzone/equivocal by ARCHITECT CMV IgG and comparator assay was negative based on the consensus result from the comparator assay and 2 additional current, FDA-cleared, commercially available anti-CMV IgG assays.

One Centers for Disease Conctrol and Prevention (CDC) CMV IgG human serum panel, comprised of 80 samples that are either CMV IgG negative or CMV IgG positive, was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and tested using the ARCHITECT CMV IgG assay. The results were submitted to the CDC. The CDC added their result interpretation for each sample.

The percent $( \% )$ agreement values of the ARCHITECT CMV IgG assay relative to the CDC results were calculated. The positive $\%$ agreement and corresponding two-sided $9 5 \%$ CI was $100 \%$ $( 9 1 . 5 9 \%$ , $100 \%$ . The negative $\%$ agreement and corresponding two-sided $9 5 \%$ CI was $9 2 . 1 1 \%$ $( 7 8 . 6 2 \%$ , $9 8 . 3 4 \%$ ). The overall $\%$ agreement and corresponding two-sided $9 5 \%$ CI was $9 6 . 2 5 \%$ $8 9 . 4 3 \%$ , $9 9 . 2 2 \%$ ).

The results are presented as a means to convey further information on the performance of this assay with a masked, characterized serum panel. This does not imply endorsement of the assay by the CDC.

# 3. Matrix Comparison:

Samples were obtained from a specimen vendor from a minimum of 40 donors (at least 20 CMV IgG negative and 20 CMV IgG positive donors) in the control tube type (serum, plastic) and in the following evaluation tube types:

Table 15. Tube Types for Matrix Comparison Study

For each donor set, the mean concentration was calculated for the control tube type.

For each donor set, the difference between the evaluation tube first replicate concentration and the control tube mean concentration was calculated using the following equation:

Difference $=$ Evaluation Tube First Replicate – Control Tube Mean

For each donor set, the percent $( \% )$ difference was calculated using the following equation:

# Control Tube Mean

The mean of the differences $1 \%$ differences across donors and the two-sided $9 5 \%$ CI across donors are summarized by analyte level and tube type

The tube types under evaluation were considered acceptable if, when compared to the control tube type, the mean difference in measured CMV IgG concentration were

• $\leq + 0 . 6 \mathrm { A U / m L }$ for samples with concentrations less than $6 . 0 \mathrm { A U / m L }$ , • $\leq + 1 . 5 \mathrm { A U / m L }$ for samples with concentrations between 6.0 AU/mL and less than $1 5 . 0 \mathrm { A U / m L }$ , and • $\ge - 1 0 \%$ for samples with concentrations greater than or equal to 15.0 AU/mL.

All tube types tested met the evaluation criteria and are suitable for use with the ARCHITECT CMV IgG assay.
