Device Name IntelliSep test

Indications for Use (Describe)

The Cytovale IntelliSep test is a semi-quantitative test that assesses cellular host response via deformability cytometry of leukocyte biophysical properties and is intended for use in conjunction with clinical assessments and laboratory findings to aid in the early detection of sepsis with organ dysfunction manifesting within the first 3 days after testing. It is indicated for use in adult patients with signs and symptoms of infection who present to the Emergency Department. The test is performed on an EDTA anticoagulated whole blood sample.

The IntelliSep test generates an IntelliSep Index value that falls within one of three discrete interpretation bands based on the probability of sepsis with organ dysfunction manifesting within the first three days after testing. The IntelliSep test represents the probability of the clinical syndrome of sepsis and is intended to be used alongside other clinical information and clinical judgement. It does not identify the causative agent of infection and should not be used as the sole basis to determine the presence of sepsis. The IntelliSep test is intended for in vitro diagnostic use.

# 5 Device Description

The Cytovale IntelliSep test is a short turn-around time (STAT) test, producing results in 10 minutes or less, to aid in the early identification of patients at risk for having or developing sepsis within three (3) days of testing. It assesses the state of immune activation in patients with clinical suspicion of infection who present in the Emergency Department (ED).

The IntelliSep test is run on the Cytovale System, a laboratory benchtop analyzer depicted in Figure

1.

To run a test, the laboratory operator transfers $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of whole blood into the sample preparation tube which is then placed into the Cytovale System. The system automatically lyses red blood cells, and washes the purified leukocytes in a diluent, producing a total volume of approximately $1 \mathrm { m L }$ of prepared sample, which the operator then transfers to the IntelliSep cartridge for analysis on the Cytovale System.

A microfluidic deformability cytometry technique is used to measure the biophysical properties of thousands of individual leukocytes in rapid succession. These properties have been shown to differ in quiescent white blood cell populations when compared to those in septic patients, enabling for rapid assessment of the host response and the likelihood of having or developing sepsis. Based on these measurements, the test provides a single score, the IntelliSep Index (ISI), ranging from 0.1-10.0, stratified into three discrete interpretation bands (Band 1, Band 2, Band 3) of sepsis likelihood.

# 7 Indication for Use

See “Intended Use”

# 8 Overall Comparison Between Subject Device and Predicate

The indications for use for both the subject and predicate devices are comparable, as they are both intended for use in conjunction with other laboratory findings and clinical assessments to aid in the risk assessment of sepsis in acute patient populations. The indications for use for the subject and predicate devices differ in the type of analytical method used to detect their specific intended assay markers and in the specific subpopulations of acute patients being assessed (e.g., Emergency Dept vs ICU).

Identification and analysis of non-microbial host immune response analytes is the scientific foundation for both the subject and predicate devices. For the predicate device, quantification of procalcitonin is performed to assess the inflammatory response to bacterial infection. The subject device instead quantifies changes in cellular biophysical properties of leukocytes (immune cells) that occur as part of the inflammatory response to infection. While the intended uses of the predicate and subject device are similar, the predicate device measures a released biomarker and the subject device directly evaluates cellular morphology.

Both the predicate and the subject device aid in the identification of sepsis in conjunction with other laboratory findings and clinical assessments. None of the differences constitute a new intended use for the subject device.

Information related to this comparison is tabulated in Table 3.

# 9 Performance Testing

9.1 Clinical Performance Summary

Cytovale conducted a blinded, prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study at five hospitals at four geographically dispersed sites comprised of both academic and community hospital Emergency Departments (EDs) in the United States. The study cohort was representative of the adult population $( \geq 1 8$ years of age) typical of those presenting to EDs across the United States with signs or suspicion of infection (defined as meeting two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria where one must be aberration of temperature or white blood cell count OR an order placed for cultures of blood, sputum, urine, or sterile body fluids).

599 subjects were enrolled in the study and 572 evaluable subjects were included in the primary analyses. As shown in Table 4, subjects spanned across ranges of age (18 to 103 years of age; $3 3 \%$ of subjects $\ge 6 5$ ), race ( $62 \%$ white, $30 \%$ Black or African American, $2 \%$ Asian, and $6 \%$ other), ethnicity $6 \%$ Hispanic), and sex ( $44 \%$ female). They encompassed those with common comorbidities, including but not limited to diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, cancer, and obesity. Infection sources affecting or originating from all major organ systems (i.e., respiratory, genitourinary, skin, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular system, central nervous system, and bone) were represented in the study. Additionally, because this study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, $9 \%$ of the subjects enrolled in the study were SARS-CoV-2 positive.

The IntelliSep test was performed on an EDTA anticoagulated whole blood sample obtained within 4 hours of the first recorded vital sign (triage). Subsequently, subjects were followed with retrospective chart review for outcome information. Subjects received standard of care and treating physicians were unaware of study enrollment and IntelliSep test results.

Table 4: Study population characteristics per sepsis status (Sepsis-3 consensus definition in the forced adjudication scheme)

The performance of the IntelliSep test was evaluated by comparison to non-reference retrospective physician adjudication. As detailed below, all subjects were adjudicated by two qualified physicians following the consensus definitions for Sepsis-2 and Sepsis-3. Discordant results were arbitrated through a committee meeting that included a third physician. The adjudication process determined each case to be ‘Sepsis’ or ‘Not sepsis’ with ‘unanimous’, ‘consensus’ or ‘forced’ determinations for both Sepsis-2 and Sepsis-3 consensus definitions. No cases were excluded due to inability to arbitrate. All study personnel, including study adjudicators, were blinded to the IntelliSep test results.

A multi-tiered adjudication process was utilized to standardize and reduce the inherent subjectivity and variability of using a non-reference comparator. Approximately 30 days after the subject was enrolled, a chart review, using a structured case report form (CRF), was performed. All sites were required to extract the same information to enable adjudication based on the case report form. The information captured included demographics, laboratory results, vital signs, past medical history, hospital encounter information, infectious disease information, medications, and discharge disposition. Additionally, objective evidence of infection (present at the time of ED presentation) and organ dysfunction (manifesting within 3 days following ED presentation) using the Sequential (sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was captured. Furthermore, a clinical impression was prepared by designated study-trained physicians that were not involved in the subject’s care.

Information obtained from the Demographic and Clinical Case Report Forms, Objective Evaluation, and the clinical impression was then compiled into a case report summary (CRS) and sent to two independent adjudicators. If the two adjudicators agreed in their determination, the case was considered ‘unanimous’ adjudication. If there was disagreement, the CRS was sent to a third adjudicator and a consensus meeting was held. If all could agree, the case fell under ‘consensus’ or if following discussion consensus could not be reached, a ‘forced’ (majority two out of three) adjudication determination was reached. The study independent adjudication committee comprised of physicians with board certification in Medical or Surgical Critical Care (CC), Infectious Diseases (ID), Emergency Medicine (EM) or Internal Medicine (IM) or related fields, from different institutions who were not participating as an Investigator in the Study. Individual cases were assigned to the adjudicators by a third-party vendor, without involvement from Cytovale. Adjudicators were blinded to the identity of the Site Investigators and Medical Monitors.

The prevalence of sepsis, using the forced Sepsis-3 consensus definition adjudication scheme, was $2 6 . 6 \%$ . Results across all approaches to analyzing retrospective physician adjudication results were consistent, i.e., a clear relationship was observed between IntelliSep Index (ISI) and the increasing likelihood of having or developing sepsis within 3 days across (Figure 2). Irrespective of the comparator scheme chosen, the probability of sepsis in the three ISI IntelliSep test Interpretation Bands was statistically distinct, defined as non-overlapping $80 \%$ confidence intervals between the bands (Table 5 through Table 7). It is important to note that the algorithm for calculating the ISI ranges for the interpretation bands were defined based on prior sepsisfocused studies. No information from patients in this study influenced the calculations or interpretation bands of the ISI.

Table 7: Distribution of subjects, sepsis prevalence, and sepsis likelihood ratios in the three ISI IntelliSep test Interpretatio Bands for severe sepsis per Sepsis-2 consensus definition for forced, consensus, and unanimous adjudication schemes.

The IntelliSep ISI risk stratification score trended upwards with the adjudication determination of sepsis independent of demographic groups (age, sex, race, and ethnicity; Table 8). Additionally, trends were observed between increasing ISI values across the Interpretation bands and hospital care metrics (e.g., hospital admission, ICU admission and transfer, hospital length of stay, and administration of antibiotics; Table 9). It is important to note, that the study was not designed nor powered to evaluate endpoints with regards to severity of illness or hospital care metrics (e.g., mortality, severity of illness scores, hospital admission and length of stay, etc.) and any significant trends or correlations observed between these metrics and the ISI and its Interpretation bands are only observational.

Additionally, subjects who have received systemic corticosteroids and subjects with preexisting end stage renal disease (ESRD) who undergo hemodialysis were not excluded from the clinical study, however, the study was not powered to evaluate the performance of the ISI specifically in these subpopulations.

# 9.2 Descriptive (Non-Powered) Analyses

In addition to examining study endpoints, descriptive non-powered analyses were performed to explore test performance by demographic subgroups. These non-powered descriptive analyses evaluated the association of IntelliSep Index (expressed in terms of its Interpretation Bands) with the predictive value of sepsis (an adjudicated non-reference method) using the Sepsis-3 consensus standard definition, for demographic subgroups split by age and sex.

The association was examined by the non-overlap of the $80 \%$ confidence intervals around point estimates for the probability of sepsis in Band 1 and Band 3 These descriptive analyses were performed using a forced adjudication scheme with evaluable subjects and are shown in Table 10 and Figure 3 (age, ${ < } 6 5$ and ${ \ge } 6 5$ years) and Table 11 and Figure 4 (sex, male and female).

# 9.3.2.2 Reproducibility

Total reproducibility was calculated by adding within-laboratory precision and Across Sites reproducibility. The Across Site reproducibility was measured according to CLSI EP05-A3 using IntelliSep Quality Control Kit samples. Testing was conducted at 3 sites using the same lots of control material. At each site, testing was performed for 40 non-consecutive days for both Quality Control levels, for a total of 240 tests.

# 9.3.2.3 Reagents Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility

The Cytovale reagents (consisting of the Cytovale Reagent Kit, Diluent and Cleanse solutions) lot-to-lot reproducibility was tested according to CLSI EP26-A using IntelliSep Quality Control samples.

Testing was performed on two lots of reagents for each of the three types listed above. For each lot of reagents, each IntelliSep Quality Control level (L1 and L2) was tested five times over three days, resulting in 60 IntelliSep tests. An equivalence test examined if the Cytovale reagents sets have an absolute mean difference of less than 1.0 ISI unit.

# 9.3.4.2 Sample Carry-Over

The study to evaluate sample carry-over was based on the principles of CLSI EP10-A3-AMD and measured the impact to the ISI due to carryover between two samples whose cells have different biophysical properties.

The study was conducted over 5 days at 1 site with 1 instrument and 1 operator. Two levels from the IntelliSep Quality Control Kit (L1 and L2) were evaluated using eleven replicates of L1 (“L” or “Low”) and ten replicates of L2 (“H” or “High”) cycled between each other. On each test day, a specified carryover sample order test set was performed to determine the impact on ISI of an L2 sample preceding an L1 sample (“HL”), and an L1 sample preceding an L2 sample (“LH”). No sample carry-over effect was found as shown in the following table.
