# 1. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

cobas® HCV is a quantitative test performed on the cobas® 5800 System, cobas® 6800 System and cobas® 8800 System. cobas® HCV enables the detection and quantitation of HCV RNA in EDTA plasma or serum of infected patients. Dual probes are used to detect and quantify, but not discriminate genotypes 1–6. The viral load is quantified against a non-HCV armored RNA quantitation standard (RNA-QS), which is introduced into each specimen during sample preparation. The RNA-QS also functions as an internal control to assess substantial failures during the sample preparation and PCR amplification processes. In addition, the test utilizes three external controls: a high titer positive, a low titer positive, and a negative control.

# 1.1. Principles of the Procedure

cobas® HCV is based on fully automated sample preparation (nucleic acid extraction and purification) followed by PCR amplification and detection. The cobas® 5800 System is designed as one integrated instrument. The cobas® 6800/8800 Systems consist of the sample supply module, the transfer module, the processing module, and the analytic module. Automated data management is performed by the cobas® 5800 System or cobas® 6800/8800 Systems software(s) which assigns test results for all tests as target not detected, $<$ LLoQ (lower limit of quantitation), $> \mathrm { U L o Q }$ (upper limit of quantitation) or HCV RNA detected, a value in the linear range $\mathrm { L L o Q } \leq x \leq \mathrm { U L o Q }$ . Results can be reviewed directly on the system screen, exported, or printed as a report.

Nucleic acid from patient samples, external controls and added armored RNA-QS molecules are simultaneously extracted by addition of proteinase and lysis reagent to the sample. The released nucleic acid binds to the silica surface of the added magnetic glass particles. Unbound substances and impurities, such as denatured protein, cellular debris and potential PCR inhibitors are removed with subsequent wash buffer steps and purified nucleic acid is eluted from the magnetic glass particles with elution buffer at elevated temperature.

Selective amplification of target nucleic acid from the patient sample is achieved by the use of target virus-specific forward and reverse primers which are selected from highly conserved regions of HCV. Selective amplification of RNA-QS is achieved by the use of sequence-specific forward and reverse primers which are selected to have no homology with the HCV genome. A thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme is used for both reverse-transcription and PCR amplification. The target and RNA-QS sequences are amplified simultaneously utilizing a universal PCR amplification profile with predefined temperature steps and number of cycles. The master mix includes deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP), instead of deoxythimidine triphosphate (dTTP), which is incorporated into the newly synthesized DNA (amplicon).1-3 Any contaminating amplicon from previous PCR runs are eliminated by the AmpErase enzyme, which is included in the PCR mix, during the first thermal cycling step. However, newly formed amplicon are not eliminated since the AmpErase enzyme is inactivated once exposed to temperatures above $5 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

The cobas® HCV master mix contains dual detection probes specific for the HCV target sequences and one for the RNA-QS. The probes are labeled with target-specific fluorescent reporter dyes allowing simultaneous detection of HCV target and RNA-QS in two different target channels. 4,5 When not bound to the target sequence, the fluorescent signal of the intact probe is suppressed by a quencher dye. During the PCR amplification step, hybridization of the probes to the specific single-stranded DNA template results in cleavage of the probe by the $5 "$ -to-3' nuclease activity of the DNA polymerase resulting in separation of the reporter and quencher dyes and the generation of a fluorescent signal. With each PCR cycle, increasing amounts of cleaved probes are generated and the cumulative signal of the reporter dye increases concomitantly. Real-time detection and discrimination of PCR products is accomplished by measuring the fluorescence of the released reporter dyes for the viral targets and RNA-QS.

# 4. ASSAY PERFORMANCE

# 4.1. System Equivalency / System Comparison

System equivalency of the cobas® 5800, cobas® 6800 and cobas® 8800 Systems was demonstrated via performance studies. The term Technical Equivalency Verification (TEV) studies is used to described these system equivalency studies.

To transfer the commercially available cobas® HCV assay from the cobas® 6800/8800 System to the cobas® 5800 System, an assay migration approach has been pursued following the FDA guidance for “Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices” (FDA-2008-N-0642). Therefore, only a selection of performance studies for cobas® HCV has been executed to prove equivalence of the two platforms. A summary of these studies is included in Table 2 and the sections below.

The results presented in the Instructions for Use support equivalent performance for all systems.

\*See Section 4.2 for more information on Reproducibility. \*\*See Section 4.3 for more information on Method Comparison.

# 4.2. Reproducibility (Precision)

Reproducibility was assessed for HCV with a panel ranging from $1 . 5 0 \mathrm { E + } 0 1 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to $1 . 0 0 \mathrm { E } { + } 0 8 $ IU/mL. A dilution series consisting of clinical specimen and plasmid RNA sample was used to generate the Reproducibility (Precision) panel. HCV positive material was serially diluted in plasma to create a panel of 7 members that includes concentration levels at, below, and above medical decision points. The testing of 3 replicates was performed over 5 days, using 3 cobas® 5800 instruments at 3 different sites (1 internal and 2 external) and 3 cobas® 6800/8800 instruments at 1 internal site, 2 runs per day per instrument and by using overall three different lots of the cobas® HCV kits. The results for cobas® HCV on the cobas® 5800 and cobas® 6800/8800 Systems are displayed in Table 3.

# 4.3. Method Comparison

A Method comparison study was performed using 150 archived or contrived, well-characterized HCV positive plasma specimens with titers ranging from $1 . 5 \mathrm { E } { + 0 1 }$ to $1 \mathrm { E + 0 } 8 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to assess the assay performance equivalency. In addition, $3 0 \mathrm { H C V }$ negative individual specimens were used. Each of the specimens was tested on the cobas® 5800 System at three different sites (1 internal and 2 external) and on a cobas® 6800/8800 System at one site (internal).

The Method Comparison study for cobas® HCV met all the clinical and statistical acceptance criteria with the exception of the statistical criterion for bias estimates at the 3 medical decision points. Although the bias estimates were statistically significant, the differences are not clinically significant given that the biases are well below the standard deviation observed in the Reproducibility Study of the cobas® HCV on the cobas® 6800/8800 Systems and both the upper and lower bound of the $9 5 \%$ CIs are close to zero. Therefore, the two systems are clinically equivalent at all medical decision points. It is important to note that for high precision molecular assays, small differences may be statistically significant but may not be clinically relevant. A summary of the results can be found in Table 4.

# 5. CONCLUSIONS

The cobas® HCV for use on the cobas® 5800 System is the same as the device approved in PMA P150015. There have been no changes to the device to accommodate this claim expansion to include use on the cobas® 5800 System.

A comparison of the technological characteristics and conclusions drawn from nonclinical performance studies demonstrate that the device is substantially equivalent and performs as well as the legally marketed predicate device identified above.
