# Substantial Equivalence

Maine Molecular Quality Controls, Inc. (MMQCI) proposes that SPOTFIRE RSP Pos & Neg Controls are substantially equivalent to MMQCI’s product, BioFire RP2.1/RP2.1plus Control Panel M441 (K202196). The manufacturing processes and components used to manufacture SPOTFIRE RSP Pos & Neg Controls are similar to those of the predicate device. SPOTFIRE RSP Pos & Neg Controls are used as quality controls for assays on the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System, while the predicate device is used for assays on the BioFire FilmArray System. However, the 2 systems encompass similar technology; on board extraction and nested multiplexed PCR with assessment of endpoint melting curve data. The rationale for equivalence is listed in Table 3 below.

# Summary of Performance Data

Three (3) lots of SPOTFIRE RSP Positive Control and 3 of SPOTFIRE RSP Negative Control, were manufactured by MMQCI at MMQCI’s facility in Saco, Maine. The lots were manufactured and tested such that routine variables, including lots of key manufacturing components, different operators, pouch lots, instruments, test sites, and testing over time were incorporated to challenge manufacture processes and product performance. External and internal studies were performed by testing the 3 lots with the SPOTFIRE R Panel assay on the SPOTFIRE System (BioFire Diagnostics) to generate a total of 361 test results.

For the external performance study, 5 near-patient clinical sites (the SPOTFIRE R Panel intended use environment) tested samples of each of the 3 lots of SPOTFIRE RSP Positive Controls and SPOTFIRE RSP Negative Controls as they would test controls during normal operations, using 25 SPOTFIRE R Panel pouch lots, incorporating multiple operators and instruments for a total of 232 tests, including 7 with Invalid results which were repeated. The internal study was performed by testing samples of each of the 3 lots at MMQCI (Saco, Maine) on different days with 3 pouch lots by 3 operators for a total of 129 tests (3 controls with Invalid results were repeated). One of the pouch lots used at the MMQCI site was also used at a clinical site.

# Results and Conclusions:

Of the total 361 tests performed, there were 10 Invalid results which were repeated for 351 valid test results. The Invalid results included instrument errors (3) and failed internal pouch controls (7). The Invalid samples were re-tested according to BioFire instructions and were not included in the Percent Correct analysis in Table 2 below. Of the 351 valid results, 350 results were correct. One SPOTFIRE RSP Positive Control failed due to false negative results for 3 analytes.

Reproducibility of SPOTFIRE RSP Positive and RSP Negative Control at 6 sites, across 27 unique pouch lots, 3 control lots, on multiple instruments by multiple operators is acceptable according to predetermined criteria with an overall correct result rate of $9 9 . 7 \%$ . Test results demonstrate robust performance across 6 testing sites.

# External Site Testing Details

A total of 232 samples of SPOTFIRE RSP Positive and RSP Negative Control were tested at 5 near-patient clinical sites, the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R Panel intended use environment. The sites were asked to follow the SPOTFIRE R Panel IUO Quick Guide to run the controls as they would during normal operations, e.g. training a new operator, receiving new shipments of R Panel test kits, receiving new or repaired instrumentation, and whenever the test kits have been stored at an incorrect temperature. It was recommended a negative quality control sample be run at least monthly to monitor for environmental contamination. The amount of QC a site performed was based on the number of operators they had and the amount of SPOTFIRE R Panel testing their site performed.

Three lots of SPOTFIRE RSP Positive Control (A02NOV20, B06NOV20, C10NOV20) and 4 lots of SPOTFIRE RSP Negative Control (F09JUL19, D11MAR20, H05MAY20, C13MAY20) were tested on 25 SPOTFIRE R Panel pouch lots across the 5 sites, incorporating multiple operators and instruments. Of the 232 controls tested, there were 7 with Invalid results which were repeated for a total of 225 controls with valid results. Of the 7 Invalid results, 4 were due to failed internal pouch controls and 3 were due to instrument errors.

# Results and Conclusion:

Out of 225 tests with valid results, the correct analytes were detected (for positive controls) or not detected (for negative controls) in 224 tests, for an overall success rate of $9 9 . 6 \%$ (Table 4). One SPOTFIRE RSP Positive Control failed due to false negative results for 3 analytes. The predetermined acceptance criteria for reproducibility were met. SPOTFIRE RSP Positive Control and RSP Negative Control performed robustly at the 5 external test sites across 25 pouch lots on the SPOTFIRE System, incorporating multiple operators.
