# VI Standards/Guidance Documents Referenced:

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision and reproducibility of results obtained with the SPOTFIRE RSP Positive and Negative Controls was evaluated using three lots of finished material that were tested with multiple lots of SPOTFIRE R Panel reagents, over multiple days, with multiple operators and using multiple BioFire SpotFire Systems, as follows.

# External Sites

Testing was performed at 5 sites that were representative of the Intended Use environment for the SPOTFIRE R Panel (i.e., sites performing near-patient testing). The SPOTFIRE RSP Positive and Negative Controls were tested according to the SPOTFIRE R Panel instructions for use as intended during normal, day-to-day operations (e.g., training a new operator, upon receipt of new reagents or a new instrument, or following instrument service). The number of control panels tested varied by site according to the number of operators and volume of SPOTFIRE R Panel testing performed. A total of 37 SPOTFIRE instruments were used across the 5 study sites in conjunction with 25 lots of SPOTFIRE R Panel pouches.

# Internal Maine Molecular Site

Testing of the SPOTFIRE RSP Positive and Negative Controls internally at Maine Molecular Quality Controls was performed over multiple days on a single SPOTFIRE instrument by 3 operators using 3 lots of control panels and 3 lots of SPOTFIRE R Panel pouches.

In total, 361 controls were tested across all sites, including 179 Positive Controls and 182 Negative Controls (Table 2). There were 10 invalid results affecting 7 Positive Controls and 3 Negative Controls (7 due to internal pouch control failure and 3 due to instrument errors).

All controls with invalid results were retested yielding a total of 351 valid control results (172 Positive Controls and 179 Negative Controls). One Positive Control failed because negative results were obtained for 4 of the target analytes. All other control results were as expected. The overall Positive Control failure rate was $0 . 6 \%$ (1/172).

The reproducibility and precision of the SPOTFIRE RSP Positive and Negative Controls was acceptable.

Testing of controls that produced invalid results $( { \mathfrak { n } } = 1 0$ ) was repeated. 1 Invalid results due to instrument or pouch failure were excluded from calculation of control pass rate 2 1 Positive Control failed because negative results were obtained for Influenza A H1-2009, Influenza A H3 and Parainfluenza Virus. All other invalid results for the Positive and Negative Controls were due to pouch or instrument errors. The overall Positive Control failure rate across all sites and lots of controls was $0 . 6 \%$ (1/172).
