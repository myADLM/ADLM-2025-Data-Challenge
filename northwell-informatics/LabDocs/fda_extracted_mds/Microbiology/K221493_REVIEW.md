# II Submission/Device Overview:

# A Purpose for Submission:

The purpose is to update the MicroScan Prompt Inoculation System-D device labeling. Previously obtained QC, reproducibility, and clinical data for the MicroScan Dried Gram negative and/or Gram positive MIC/Combo panels, as noted in recent 510(k) decision summaries, is applicable to support this submission.

The Prompt Inoculation method was originally developed by 3M Company and cleared in K820299 (product 6307).

# B Measurand:

Standardized suspensions of bacteria equivalent to a 0.5McFrland standard.

# C Type of Test:

Inoculum calibration device for microdilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test.

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The MicroScan Prompt Inoculation System-D is used to standardize inocula for microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility tests.

The MicroScan Prompt Inoculation System-D is an accessory to the MicroScan Gram Negative and Gram Positive MIC/Combo Panels. Indications for use organisms are specific for each antimicrobial agent on the panel.

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Rx - For Prescription Use Only

# Limitations:

1. The Prompt Inoculation System-D should not be used when the colony size is smaller than the wand tip. Examples of organisms that may not meet the size requirement are Streptococcus spp. other than S. bovis and S. agalactiae (Group B). Picking colonies which are too small will result in under-inoculation and may cause a resistant organism to appear to be susceptible. An alternate method of inoculum preparation should be used for colonies smaller than the wand tip.

2. Some mucoid strains of organisms such as Klebsiella spp. or Pseudomonas spp. may not adhere to the Prompt wand when attempting to pick the colony. This will be visually apparent. An alternate method of inoculum preparation should be used for such organisms.

3. Refer to the appropriate MicroScan panel Procedural Manual for each antimicrobial agent.

# D Special Instrument Requirements:

Not Applicable.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The MicroScan Prompt Inoculation System-D is a method for obtaining standardized bacterial inoculum while eliminating the need for incubation and turbidity adjustment with inocula prepared according to the CLSI procedure. It consists of an inoculation wand and a bottle of diluent. The wand is a polypropylene rod with a breakaway collar that serves as a wiping mechanism. The rod is attached to a stopper. At the tip of the wand is a groove designed to hold a specific amount of bacteria equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard. Thirty (30) ml of diluent (Pluronic is used as the surfactant) are provided in the plastic bottle. Each kit contains 60 plastic bottles, each containing $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of stabilized aqueous Pluronic surfactants and 62 inoculation wands.

# B Principle of Operation:

The MicroScan Prompt Inoculation System-D is an in vitro accessory which aids in the inoculum preparation for use with MicroSan Dried Gram positive and/or Gram negative MIC/Combo panels for quantitative and qualitative antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

The MicroScan Prompt Inoculation System-D wand is touched to several bacterial colonies on a primary isolation plate, wiped, then placed in the plastic bottle. The bacteria are suspended by shaking the bottle. The bacterial suspension, which is equivalent to a $0 . 5 \mathrm { M c F }$ arland, is stable for four hours after preparation.
