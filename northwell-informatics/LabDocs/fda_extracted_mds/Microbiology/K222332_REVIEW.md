# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The MeMed BV (“BV Test” or the “Test”) is an In Vitro Diagnostic device that measures in parallel the blood concentrations of TRAIL, IP-10 and CRP. The Test consists of an automated analyzer with built-in hardware and software that conduct chemiluminescence-based analyte measurements of patient serum samples and their computational integration (MeMed Key), and a disposable cartridge that contains the reagents and controls needed to detect the analytes of interest (MeMed BV cartridge). The Test generates an answer to each sample, with a test run time of approximately 15 minutes.

# B Principle of Operation:

The test system is composed of the analyzer (MeMed Key) and the cartridge, and their respective sub-components. The product is designed to allow straightforward sample-to-answer testing, with a test run time of approximately 15 minutes.

The patient’s serum specimen is pipetted by the user into the designated cartridge area. The users are instructed to fill $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of sample. Each single-use cartridge is provided in a package that contains all necessary components for conducting a single patient test. This consists of the cartridge itself, all disposables (pipette tips), reagents and a waste collection well. The cartridge assembly contains both the reagents for the different assays and the pipette tips. The cartridge is a multi-cavity plastic container that is sealed off with foil and covered with a label on the foil that indicates the sample type, the test name, indication to the user where to input the sample,

required sample volume, lot number, cartridge expiry date and a barcode with test data and parameters that are intended to be read by the analyzer.

The cartridge contains the several reagents in separate cavities, which are required to perform the test. Upon insertion of the cartridge, the analyzer conducts three immunoassays on a single serum sample of $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ . The cartridge also securely stores all waste materials collected during the test.

The user inserts the cartridge with sample into the analyzer and is guided by the carriage caddy. The analyzer auto-reads the cartridge's barcode and verifies that the requested test matches the cartridge type, cartridge expiration date, and that the calibration curve matches the cartridge lot number. The analyzer notifies the user when specimen processing is initiated and when the user should expect the test result.

After the cartridge has been inserted, the carriage caddy system locks and guides the cartridge during the insertion phase. Once loaded, the cartridge holder is driven by the robot to the left, in position for processing.

The liquids are handled through the pipettor, which operates through measurement of displaced air volumes by means of a flow sensor, integrated directly in the pipetting head that is connected to a high-speed solenoid valve. The flow sensor is based on a differential pressure measurement across flow restriction. The cartridge is then heated through the heater block. A software-driven Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) control system is used to set and regulate the temperature of the heater block, using the center thermistor for feedback.

Once the sample has been diluted and mixed with magnetic particles, it is processed by the bead immobilizer magnet, which generates a high magnetic field strength, and allows both the reduction of immobilization time and a high percentage of bead retention per immobilization to be achieved. The sample is then washed and the chemiluminescence step takes place.

The chemiluminescence of the assay is measured by a Photo Multiplier Tube (PMT) Module, a highly sensitive light detection device. The selected PMT Module has a spectral range which matches the expected wavelength generated by the chemistry luminescence. When a PMT reading is required, the software then turns the PMT Module on and a reading is taken. Once readings have been completed, the software automatically turns the PMT Module off.

Each RLU measurement for each of the analytes is processed and translated to a concentration measurement using a calibration curve that is generated using calibration materials provided by MeMed. When a clinical serum sample is run, the resulting concentrations are also processed to apply a clinical correction factor, which is pre-determined for each of the analytes. This clinical correction factor exists primarily because of matrix-effects (in the serum) which may impact the generated signal compared to the calibration which is run on recombinant proteins. Final concentrations for each analyte are then processed to generate a Score result which places the specimen into one of five distinct bins, with higher score values corresponding to increasing likelihood of a bacterial infection.

The MeMed $\mathrm { B V ^ { T M } }$ test result is a score between 0 and 100 derived from computational integration of the measurements of the three proteins TRAIL, IP-10, and CRP, where low scores are indicative of viral infection and high score of bacterial infection.

• $0 \leq$ score ${ \le } 1 0$ : High likelihood of viral infection (or other non-bacterial etiology) • $1 0 <$ score ${ < } 3 5$ : Moderate likelihood of viral infection (or other non-bacterial etiology) • $3 5 \leq$ score ${ \le } 6 5$ : Equivocal • $6 5 <$ score ${ \tt < } 9 0 $ : Moderate likelihood of bacterial infection (or co-infection) • $9 0 \leq$ score $\leq 1 0 0$ : High likelihood of bacterial infection (or co-infection)

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

A multi-site reproducibility study was performed across three laboratories. The measurements were performed over five non-consecutive days. At each site, a single operator conducted the tests on two different analyzers using one cartridge lot, with three runs performed each day per panel member.

Calibration was performed on the first day on each analyzer; one calibrator lot was used.   
External controls (ECs) were also run daily using one lot of ECs.

The ‘infectious’ specimens were collected from non-U.S. individuals recruited to an infectious cohort as defined by the MeMed BV test intended use/indications for use under an appropriate clinical study protocol.

The samples were collected, centrifuged within 1 hour after blood withdrawal, aliquoted (120 $\mu \mathrm { L } )$ and frozen at $- 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Prior initiation of the reproducibility study, the aliquots were sent on dry ice to the participating laboratories. Each aliquot was thawed 10-15 min on a roller prior to measurement on the MeMed Key instrument.

The following panel members were utilized for the reproducibility study:

$^ { 1 } { \cal C } \mathrm { V }$ analysis was not considered for the logistic scale of the MeMed BV Score. The acceptance criterion for the score was set to be $\mathrm { S D } < 1 2 . 5$ score units which reflects a small probability of scores falling into nonadjacent bins.

An additional study was performed to estimate lot-to-lot variance for each measurand and the test result for four panel members. The lot-to-lot study was performed on 3 days as follows: Operator 1 at Site 1 conducted three runs per day for each of the four panel members using two lots of cartridges on the same Analyzer. Two calibration lots were used, one for each cartridge lot. External controls were run daily using one lot of EC reagents. Results from the lot variability study are included in Table 3 below.

$^ { 1 } { \mathrm { C V } }$ analysis was not considered for the logistic scale of the MeMed BV Score. The acceptance criterion for the score was set to be $\mathrm { S D } < 1 2 . 5$ score units which reflects a small probability of scores falling into nonadjacent bins.

The results comply with the pre-established acceptance criteria for score and individual analytes. A maximal CV of $8 . 3 \%$ was obtained for IP-10 panel member C. For score, the maximal SD obtained between the lots is 1.9 (for panel member B).

# 2. Linearity:

A study was performed to assess the linearity of measurement for each of the three measurands (TRAIL/IP-10/CRP) with acceptance criteria for bias due to non-linearity or less than $10 \%$ or, alternatively, $1 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ for CRP, $1 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ for TRAIL, and $5 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ for IP-10. Linearity is not applicable to the Test result (score), as it is calculated using a pre-defined weighted multinomial logistic regression model. The study was performed in a single laboratory with one analyzer, two lots of cartridges, and one lot of calibration and external control reagents. Eleven dilutions of individual analytes were prepared in protein rich buffer and measured four times. The range of concentrations tested spanned the applicable range for determination of the MeMed BV score and were $2 2 { \cdot } 3 0 4 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ for TRAIL, $1 2 7 { - } 2 2 0 6 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ for IP-10, and $1 { - } 2 4 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ for CRP. Linearity for IP10 and TRAIL measurands fell within the study acceptance criteria, A deviation of approximately $1 5 \%$ was observed for CRP in a single sample. However, re-analysis of clinical data considering a potential bias of $1 5 \%$ in CRP measurement demonstrated no significant impact on device performance and therefore the expected clinical impact of the observed bias is expected to be minimal.

An interference study was performed to evaluate the impact of select interferents and crossreactants on the test score. Each interferent and cross-reactant was tested using two panel members that represent score bins 1 and 5 (a ‘low’ score, and ‘high’ score, respectively). Interference was assessed by estimating the bias for each specimen when compared to a sample without interferent. Each interferant was tested using eight replicates for each spiked and non-spiked (no interferent) specimen. Results from the interference study are included in the below table.

These data demonstrate that the presence of commonly encountered interferants does not significantly alter the MeMed BV score. For all evaluated specimens, the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval for the bias lies within $+ / - 1 2 . 5$ score units for all the interferants and cross-reactants in the indicated concentrations for both bacterial and viral clinical samples.

Interference by Human Anti-Mouse Antibody (HAMA) was also assessed by evaluating 3 contrived serum specimens that contained different amounts of HAMA. To generate these specimens a clinical serum sample (Level 1) was intermixed with a commercially available serum sample that contained high concentrations of HAMA (Level 5). Each individual specimen was run on two analyzers with a total of eight repeats for each sample. Acceptance criteria were that individual TRAIL, CRP, and IP-10 concentrations in the presence of HAMA should fall within $10 \%$ of the concentration without interferant. All samples successfully met the acceptance criteria demonstrating a lack of interference from HAMA.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

The calibration is a process used to generate the calibration curve and must be repeated every four weeks and/or when introducing a new test cartridge lot. The calibration curve translates RLU measurements to concentration of each analyte. A calibration is unique to a device and a cartridge lot. The calibrators are in effect synthetic samples which can be measured by the device using the normal cartridge. Each calibrator is a solution of the 3 analytes introduced as recombinant proteins. Each calibration set includes three vials that represent high, medium, and low values of the analyte ranges that impact the MeMed BV test score. Calibrators are provided by MeMed in vials which need to be stored in normal refrigerators $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . All three analytes are traceable to a standard. The TRAIL analyte is traced to international biological reference standard, NIBSC code: 04/166. The CRP analyte is traced to international standard, IFCC/BCR/CAP CRM 474. The IP-10 analyte is traced to an internal standard prepared by R&D Systems (Cat. #890836) due to the unavailability of international standards for IP-10.The material was produced following ISO Guide 34:2009.

The quality indicators (i.e., max/min slope, max/min intercept, min slope, and $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 }$ ) represent specifications for calibration curves created with released cartridges. These thresholds are established for each lot of cartridges during manufacturing (based on actual performance of the produced lot). The data is then encoded to the cartridge barcode, to be read by the analyzer when running a calibration. Failure to meet these thresholds (during run-time of a calibration) will fail the calibration. In case of a calibration failure the device will issue a failure message to the user and will prevent the failed cartridge-lot from running. The device will only run with cartridges from a lot which has a valid calibration. It is possible to calibrate more than one cartridge lot.

# Controls

The MeMed BV External controls are intended for quality control testing in clinical laboratories. The control set includes two control vials containing purified TRAIL, IP-10, and CRP antigens in a protein buffer. One vial corresponds to a bacterial MeMed BV test score (expected score 90-100) and one vial corresponds to a viral MeMed BV test score (expected score 0-10). The software evaluates each control and notifies the user whether the evaluation is completed successfully.

# Calibrators

A study was conducted to support increasing the calibration frequency of the MeMed Key instrument from every two weeks to every four weeks. Stability of the calibration interval was evaluated using the same methodology to support the initial clearance in K210254. Briefly, two cartridge lots were utilized on three MeMed Key instruments. Two calibrator lots were utilized with one lot used to establish a baseline and the other run as samples. Calibrators were run once a week for the entirety of the claimed calibration interval and acceptable drift was identified as $\leq 7 \%$ for both TRAIL and CRP analytes and $\leq 1 0 \%$ for IP10. Results from this study establish no significant drift in analyte values over 4 weeks supporting the revised calibration interval.

# Stability

Cartridge and calibrator shelf-life stability was validated following CLSI EP25-A. Realtime, in use, and shipping stability were validated using the same methodology to support the original clearance K210254.

6. Detection Limit:

Limit of Quantitation

For evaluated specimens with analyte levels below the limit of quantitation, the limit of quantitation value will be used to generate the MeMed BV score. Therefore a limit of detection and a limit of blank was not evaluated.

The LoQ for the previously cleared MeMed BV assay was established in K210254. An LoQ study was performed on the modified MeMed BV assay to evaluate Total Error and precision at low analyte levels including the previously defined LoQ in accordance with CLSI EP17- A2, Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures.

The results show that the MeMed BV test passes the acceptance criteria of TE in all samples except for Sample 1 on lot 1. The maximal TE values for the previously established LLOQ of the MeMed device (TRAIL $- 1 5 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ , CRP- $\cdot 1 \ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ , $\mathrm { { I P - 1 0 - 1 0 0 \ p g / m L } ) }$ is $21 \%$ for TRAIL, $10 \%$ for CRP, and $1 1 . 2 \%$ for IP10.

The assay cut-offs remain unchanged from the previously cleared version of the MeMed BV Device. Please see the published decision summary for K210254 for additional details.

# B Comparison Studies:

Clinical validation of the MeMed BV device in the intended use population was previously reviewed under K210254. The purpose of this 510(k) submission is to establish equivalence between the modified MeMed BV assay and the originally cleared predicate device. Please refer to the published decision summary for additional clinical validation information.

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A method comparison study was performed in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP09-A3 (Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples) to demonstrate equivalent performance between the modified MeMed BV test reviewed in this submission to the previously cleared predicate device. Specifically, one hundred serum specimens with known TRAIL, CRP, and IP-10 concentrations were measured on both the modified MeMed BV device and the previously cleared predicate device. Deming regression analysis was performed on score values and estimates of bias at each of the four cut-off points of the MeMed BV assay were obtained. The results are summarized below.

For analysis of individual analytes measured by the MeMed BV device, values outside the upper and lower limit of quantitation were replaced with the respective LoQ before averaging.
