IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The HAVAb IgG II assay is an automated two-step immunoassay for the qualitative detection of IgG anti-HAV in human adult and pediatric serum and plasma from patients with signs and symptoms or at risk for hepatitis A, using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology.

# B Principle of Operation:

The HAVAb IgG II assay is a fully automated chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA). In the first step of the assay, sample, HAV (human) coated paramagnetic microparticles, and assay diluent are combined and incubated. The IgG anti-HAV present in the sample binds to the HAV (human) coated microparticles. The mixture is then washed. In the second step, Anti-human IgG acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to create a reaction mixture and incubated. The mixture is then washed again. In the third step of the assay, the Pre-Trigger and Trigger Solutions are added. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as a relative light unit (RLU). The presence or absence of IgG anti-HAV in the sample is determined by the Alinity i system, which calculates results by comparing the chemiluminescent RLU in the reaction to the cutoff RLU determined from an active calibration. Specimens with signal to cutoff (S/CO) values $\geq 1 . 0 0$ are considered reactive for IgG anti-HAV, and specimens with S/CO values $< 1 . 0 0$ are considered nonreactive for IgG anti-HAV.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Within-laboratory Precision (20 days):

Within- laboratory Precision was evaluated for 20 days on two Alinity i instruments at one internal site. Two plasma control members- a negative (mean $0 . 1 0 \mathrm { S } / \mathrm { C O } )$ and positive (mean $2 . 2 0 \mathrm { S } / \mathrm { C O } )$ HAVAb controls, and two serum member panels- one high negative (mean 0.73 S/CO), and one low positive (mean $1 . 2 7 \ : \mathrm { S / C O ) }$ , were tested. Each sample was tested in duplicate, in two runs per day, for 20 days, with one control lot, two reagent lots, and two calibrator lots. Calibration was conducted at the beginning of the study by testing the

calibrator in triplicates. The mean $\mathrm { \bf S } / \mathrm { C O }$ and standard deviation (SD) was calculated for each sample, and the coefficient of variation $( \% C V )$ was calculated for positive samples. Withinlaboratory precision study results are shown in the following table.

# 2. Reproducibility (Multi-site):

A 5-day multi-site reproducibility study at 3 testing sites evaluated samples with 3 different reagent lots for each site, 2 lots of the calibrators, and 2 lots of the controls tested on the Alinity i system. Samples consisted of a negative $( < 0 . 5 6 \ : \mathrm { S / C O ) }$ and positive (1.03-3.53 S/CO) control, one high negative $( 0 . 6 0 { - } 0 . 8 0 \mathrm { S } / \mathrm { C O } )$ sample, and one low positive (1.24- 1.52 S/CO) sample. Testing was performed at 2 runs per day (separated by two hours between runs), in duplicates. Calibration was performed prior to the start of testing, samples were randomized, and study personnel blinded to $\mathrm { \bf S } / \mathrm { C O }$ values. The mean $\mathrm { \bf S } / \mathrm { C O }$ value and standard deviation was calculated for each sample, and the coefficient of variation $( \% C V )$ calculated for the positive samples.

Real-time stability studies conducted to date support storage of opened and unopened controls at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 4 months and In-Use Opened at 2 to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for 3 hours.

Calibrator stability:

Calibrator stability studies conducted to date support storage of opened and unopened calibrator at 2 to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ up to 4 months.

Reagent stability:

Real-time stability studies conducted to date support storage of opened and unopened reagent kits at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 4 months and onboard the Alinity i system up to 30 days.

Specimen stability:

Specimen stability studies conducted to date support stability of specimens stored at room temperature (15 to $2 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ ) up to 16 hours, at 2 to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ up to 8 days, and at $- 2 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ up to 30 days.

# 6. Detection Limit:

Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined with four normal human serum samples tested in 5 replicates, and the Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined with 4 low-level analyte samples $( 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 \mathrm { m I U / m L } )$ ) in duplicates and tested in 10 replicates. All samples were tested on two different Alinity i instruments, using two reagent lots, and one lot of each control and calibrator. The LoB was determined to be $0 . 3 5 \mathrm { S } / \mathrm { C O }$ and the LoD to be 0.40 S/CO.

# 7. Analytical Sensitivity at the Cut-Off:

The analytical sensitivity of the candidate device at the assay cutoff value of $1 . 0 0 \ : \mathrm { S / C O }$ was conducted to determine the relationship between S/CO and the units of the WHO International Standard (WHO IS) for anti-hepatitis A, Immunoglobulin, Human (NIBSC Code: 97/646). The study was performed by diluting the WHO IS with anti-HAV negative recalcified plasma to a concentration of $5 0 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ (Intermediate). Recalcified plasma is the same matrix as the calibrator/control material that is tested to be negative for anti-HAV antibodies, which is similar to serum. A panel of five different dilutions was prepared by combining the Intermediate with anti-HAV negative recalcified plasma to a concentration of 10, 12.5, 14.5, 17.5, and $2 0 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ . Each dilution was tested in 9 replicates per lot, with 3 reagent lots, on one Alinity i instrument. The calibrators and controls were also tested. For each reagent lot, the least squares linear regression analysis was performed on the mean S/CO for each dilution (mean of 9 replicates each) vs. the target concentration across the dilutions. The analytical sensitivity at $1 . 0 \ : \mathrm { S } / \mathrm { C O }$ was determined to be $1 5 . 7 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ .

8. Accuracy (Instrument): Not applicable.

9. Carry-Over:

Susceptibility of within-assay sample carryover from very high positive IgG anti-HAV samples (target $> 6 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L } )$ ) to a contrived high negative serum sample (target 0.8

S/CO) was evaluated. A wash buffer sample was tested in three replicates to clear the system. One replicate of the high negative sample was tested to serve as a sample that was not exposed to potential sample carryover (protected negative sample). This was followed by one replicate of the high positive sample that was used to introduce potential carryover effects. Then, one other replicate of the negative sample was tested to serve as a sample exposed to potential sample carryover (unprotected negative sample). This carryover event series was tested 12 times across 5 runs. The mean S/CO value, standard deviation, difference and percent difference of the means between the protected and unprotected samples was evaluated as shown below.

# B Comparison Studies:

# 1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A prospective multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the performance of HAVAb IgG II assay evaluated on three Alinity i instruments at three clinical centers in the United States. Samples were tested using three lots of HAVAb IgG II reagent, two lots of HAVAb IgG II calibrator, and two lots of HAVAb IgG II controls. A total of 944 native human serum specimens were tested, consisting of individuals at increased risk of HAV infection, individuals with signs and symptoms of hepatitis infection, HAV vaccine recipients, and pediatric population. Specimens ${ < } 1 . 0 0 \ \mathrm { S / C O }$ were considered non-reactive, and specimens $\geq$ $1 . 0 \ : \mathrm { S } / \mathrm { C O }$ were considered reactive. Percent agreement with the results obtained with the ARCHITECT HAVAB-G assay is summarized in the following sections.

# 2. Matrix Comparison/Tube Type Equivalency

The aim of the matrix equivalency study was to verify the appropriate specimen tube type for use with the HAVAb IgG II assay for serum, serum separator, and plasma (sodium heparin, lithium heparin, lithium heparin separator, dipotassium EDTA, and tripotassium EDTA) samples. A total of 22 sets of matched serum, serum separator, dipotassium EDTA, lithium heparin, sodium heparin, lithium heparin separator, and tripotassium EDTA were used in this study. The study included a total of 22 negative and 20 positive samples. Serum negative donor specimens were spiked with a high positive specimen (at a volume $\leq 5 \%$ ) to contrive high negative (0.65 to $0 . 8 6 \mathrm { S } / \mathrm { C O } )$ and low positive (1.2 to $1 . 5 \ : \mathrm { S } / \mathrm { C O } )$ samples. Each sample set was tested in at least 2 replicates, with one reagent, calibrator and control lot, on one instrument. Agreement of performance between the serum control and the evaluated tube type was calculated and supports the use of this assay with the following tube types: dipotassium EDTA, lithium heparin, sodium heparin, lithium heparin separator, serum separator, and tripotassium EDTA.

# C. Expected Values/Reference Range

The expected values were calculated based on the clinical study conducted to support the performance of the HAVAb IgG II assay on Alinity i system.

Expected Values from Apparently Healthy Individuals:

Prospectively collected serum samples from apparently healthy individuals $( \mathbf { n } = 5 1 9 )$ ) were tested with HAVAb IgG II assay on Alinity i system to evaluate the prevalence of hepatitis A virus antibodies (IgG anti-HAV) in an apparently healthy population. Study specimens from the low prevalence areas of Port Jefferson, NY and Milwaukee, WI, and the high prevalence area of Galveston, TX were enrolled in the study. The percentage of previously vaccinated individuals in this group is unknown.

The apparently healthy population consisted of the following race/ ethnic groups:

• 248 $( 4 7 . 7 8 \% )$ White   
• 149 $( 2 8 . 7 1 \% )$ Black or African American   
• 90 $( 1 7 . 3 4 \% )$ Hispanic or Latino
