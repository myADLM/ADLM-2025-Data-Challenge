Dear Neha Desai:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal

statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice (https://www.fda.gov/medical  
devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance) and CDRH Learn   
(https://www.fda.gov/training-and-continuing-education/cdrh-learn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic. See the DICE website (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatoryassistance/contact-us-division-industry-and-consumer-education-dice) for more information or contact DICE by email (DICE@fda.hhs.gov) or phone (1-800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100).

510(k) Number (if known) K222996

Device Name Access PCT

Indications for Use (Describe)

The Access PCT assay is a paramagnetic, chemiluminescent immunoassay for in vitro quantitative determination of procalcitonin (PCT) levels in human serum and plasma (lithium heparin and EDTA) using the Access Immunoassay Systems. Measurement of PCT in conjunction with other laboratory findings and clinical assessments aids in the risk assessment of critically ill patients on their first day of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission for progression to severe sepsis and septic shock.

# Summary of Studies

Method Comparison: The results of the method comparison study met the acceptance criteria of $\mathsf { R } ^ { 2 } \ge 0 . 9 5$ and slope $1 . 0 0 \pm 0 . 1 0$ and supports the equivalence of the Access PCT assay on DxI 9000 to the Access PCT assay on Access 2 Instrument. The bias data supports the reference intervals defined on the Access 2 system have not changed appreciably on the DxI 9000 system.

Method Concordance: The percentage of concordance between the Access 2 Immunoassay System and the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer for the cut-offs of 0.5 and $2 . 0 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ were $1 0 0 . 0 \%$ and $9 8 . 3 \%$ , respectively.

Imprecision: The Within Laboratory (total) $\%$ CV was between $2 . 2 \%$ and $6 . 1 \%$ for PCT concentrations $\ge 0 . 1 5 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The Within laboratory (total) SD was between $0 . 0 0 6 - 0 . 0 0 8$ for PCT concentrations $< 0 . 1 5 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

The study met the acceptance criteria of $\mathtt { S D } \le 0 . 0 1 2 \mathsf { n g } / \mathsf { m L }$ for values $< 0 . 1 5 0$ $\mathsf { n g } / \mathsf { m L }$ and $\mathsf { C V } \leq 8 . 0 \%$ for values $\ge 0 . 1 5 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

The Within Run (total) $\%$ CV was between $1 . 9 \%$ and $4 . 7 \%$ for PCT concentrations $\ge 0 . 1 5 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The Within Run (total) SD was between 0.004 – 0.007 for PCT concentrations $< 0 . 1 5 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

The study met the acceptance criteria of $\mathtt { S D } \le 0 . 0 0 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for values $< 0 . 1 5 0$ ng/mL and $\mathsf { C V } \leq 6 . 0 \%$ for values $\ge 0 . 1 5 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

Linearity: The study shows that acceptance criteria was met for detectable nonlinearity within $\pm 0 . 0 1 2 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for values $\leq 0 . 1 5 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and ± $10 \%$ for values $>$ $0 . 1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

Limit of Blank (LoB): The data demonstrated the LoB estimate of the PCT assay is $0 . 0 0 2 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , which met the acceptance criteria of $\leq 0 . 0 0 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

Limit of Detection (LoD): The data demonstrated the LoD estimate of PCT is 0.003 ng/mL which met the acceptance criteria of $\leq 0 . 0 1 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

Limit of Quantitation (LoQ): The results demonstrated the $20 \%$ CV LoQ estimate for the Access PCT assay to be 0.002 ng/mL which meets the acceptance criteria of less than or equal to $0 . 0 2 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ The maximum observed LoQ estimate for Access PCT assay on the DxI 9000 immunoassay System is less than the reported LoD value (0.003ng/mL). Following the CLSI EP17-A2 recommendation that the LoQ must be greater than or equal to LoD, the LoQ value is reported as $0 . 0 0 3 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ to align with LoD.

# Conclusion:

The information provided in this submission supports a substantial equivalence determination, and therefore 510(k) premarket notification clearance of the PCT assay on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer.
