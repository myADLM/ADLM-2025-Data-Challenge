Device Name BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ CLIA-Waived Kit

Indications for Use (Describe)

The BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ CLIA waived assay is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the direct and qualitative detection of influenza A and B viral nucleoprotein antigens from nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs of symptomatic patients. The BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ (also referred to as the BD Veritor System and BD Veritor System Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ ) is a differentiated test, such that influenza A viral antigens can be distinguished from influenza B viral antigens from a single processed sample using a single device. The test is to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza A and B viral infections. A negative test is presumptive and it is recommended that these results be confirmed by viral culture or an FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay. Negative test results do not preclude influenza viral infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. The test is not intended to detect influenza C antigens.

Performance characteristics for influenza A and B were established during January through March of 2011 when influenza viruses A/2009 H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria lineage, and B/Yamagata lineage were the predominant influenza viruses in circulation according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the CDC entitled "Update: Influenza Activity-United States, 2010-2011 Season, and Composition of the 2011- 2012 Influenza Vaccine." Performance characteristics may vary against other emerging influenza viruses.

If infection with a novel influenza virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to the state or local health department for testing. Virus culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $3 +$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

# Special Instrument Requirements:

The BD VeritorTM System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ CLIA Waived Kit is intended for use with the BD VeritorTM Plus Analyzer.

# Device Description

The BD VeritorTM System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the direct and qualitative detection of influenza A and B viral antigens from nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs of symptomatic patients. The test is to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza A and B viral infections. It is a differentiated test, such that influenza A viral antigens can be distinguished from influenza B viral antigens from a single processed sample using a single test device. Negative test results do not preclude influenza viral infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other management decisions. All negative test results should be confirmed by another methodology, such as a nucleic acid-based method.

BD VeritorTM System Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ test devices are interpreted by a BD VeritorTM Plus Analyzer. When using the BD VeritorTM Plus Analyzer, workflow steps depend on the selected operational mode and the Analyzer configuration settings. In Analyze Now mode, the instrument evaluates assay devices after manual timing of their development. In Walk Away mode, devices are inserted immediately after application of the specimen, and timing of assay development and analysis is automated. Depending on the configuration chosen by the operator, the instrument communicates status and results to the operator via a liquid crystal display (LCD) on the instrument, a connected printer, or through a secure connection to the facility’s information system.

# B. Test Principle

The BD VeritorTM Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ test is an immuno-chromatographic assay for detection of influenza A and B viral antigens in samples processed from respiratory specimens. The viral antigens detected by the BD Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ test are nucleoprotein, not hemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA) proteins. Flu viruses are prone to minor point mutations (i.e., antigenic drift) in either one or both of the surface proteins (i.e., HA or NA). The BD Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ test is not affected by antigenic drift or shift because it detects the highly conserved nucleoprotein of the influenza viruses. To perform the test, the patient specimen swab is treated in a supplied reaction tube prefilled with a lysing agent that serves to expose the target viral antigens, and then expressed through a filter tip into the sample well on a BD VeritorTM Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ test device. Any influenza A or influenza B viral antigens present in the specimen bind to antiinfluenza antibodies conjugated to colloidal gold micro-particles on the VeritorTM Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ test strip. The antigen-conjugate complex then migrates across the test strip to the capture zone and reacts with either Anti-Flu A or Anti-Flu B antibodies that are immobilized on the two test lines on the membrane.

The BD Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ test device shown in Figure 1 is designed with five spatially distinct zones including positive and negative control line positions, separate test line positions for the target analytes, and a background zone. The test lines for the target analytes are labeled on the test device as ‘A’ for flu A position, and ‘B’ for flu B position. The onboard positive control ensures the sample has flowed correctly and is indicated on the test device as ‘C’. Two of the five distinct zones on the test device are not labeled. These two zones are an onboard negative control line and an assay background zone. The active negative control feature in each test identifies and compensates for specimen-related, nonspecific signal generation. The remaining zone is used to measure the assay background.

E. Instrument

The instrument used with the BD VeritorTM System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ CLIAWaived Kit is the BD VeritorTM Plus Analyzer (also referred to as the Analyzer).

The Analyzer is a digital immunoassay instrument that uses a reflectance-based measurement method and applies assay specific algorithms to determine the presence or absence of the target analyte. The Analyzer supports the use of different assays by reading an assay-specific barcode on the test device. Depending on the configuration chosen by the operator, the instrument communicates status and results to the operator via a liquid crystal display (LCD) on the instrument, a connected printer, or through a secure connection to the facility’s information system.

In the case of the Flu $\mathbf { A } + \mathbf { B }$ test, the BD VeritorTM Plus Analyzer subtracts nonspecific signal at the negative control line from the signal present at both the Flu A and Flu B test lines. If the resultant line signal is above a pre-selected assay cutoff, the specimen scores as positive. If the resultant line signal is below the cutoff, the specimen scores as negative. Use of the active negative control feature allows the BD VeritorTM Plus Analyzer to correctly interpret test results that cannot be scored visually because the human eye is unable to accurately perform the subtraction of the nonspecific signal. The measurement of the assay background zone is an important factor during test interpretation as the reflectance is compared to that of the control and test zones. A background area that is white to light pink indicates the device has performed correctly. The instrument does not require calibration. A BD VeritorTM Plus Analyzer can be identified by the image in Figure 2.

Figure 2. BD VeritorTM Plus Analyzer

The BD VeritorTM Plus Analyzer has the flexibility of an optional bar code scanning module and connectivity module designed to facilitate record keeping as well as the addition of a “Walk Away” workflow mode. Depending on the configuration chosen by the operator, the BD VeritorTM Plus Analyzer communicates status and results to the operator via a liquid crystal display (LCD) on the instrument, a connected printer, or through a secure connection to the facility’s information system.

# Substantial Equivalence

The subject device, BD VeritorTM System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ CLIA Waived Kit is a modified version of the current legally marketed device, BD VeritorTM System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ CLIA Waived Kit. The predicate 510(k) numbers are K112277, K132259, K132692, K151291, K160161, K180438.

Table 3 provides a comparison between the two versions. In accordance with FDA’s Guidance, The 510(k) Program: Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications (July 28, 2014), the modified device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device as described in K180438. There are no changes to the device kit components. The following changes have been made to the VeritorTM Plus Analyzer:

The Analyzer’s trigger board was modified to incorporate additional circuitry for protection against overvoltage conditions which can occur when a non-BD power supply is used. The trigger board is a secondary board, separate from the main board where all assay-related functionality of the Analyzer is located. The trigger board supports a trigger switch for detection of an inserted assay cartridge and supplies DC power to the Analyzer. • The lifetime number of tests that can be performed on the VeritorTM Plus Analyzer was extended from 3,500 tests to 10,000 tests. • The optional InfoWiFi module was added to operate as part of the VeritorTM -to-BD SynapsysTM Informatics connectivity solution. Previously, the BD VeritorTM InfoScan module was available as an optional module to add the capability of reading specimen identification, operator identification, reagent lot information, reagent expiration date, and modifying the on-screen display language of the Analyzer. The BD VeritorTM InfoWiFi module was developed as an optional module to provide the same functional features as the previously available BD Veritor™ InfoScan module and adds wireless communication capability.

The claim of substantial equivalence is based on the determination that the predicate device is a legally marketed device; the modifications to the Analyzer do not result in a new intended use or different technological characteristics; and the changes do not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness. Non-clinical testing was performed to verify overvoltage protection, lifetime number of tests extension, and the functionalities of the BD VeritorTM InfoWiFi module.

# Analytical Performance

There have been no changes to the analytical performance of the BD VeritorTM System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ CLIA-Waived Kit since the assay was last cleared in K180438. The modifications to the Analyzer do not have an impact on the assay-specific analytical performance. Testing was performed to confirm (1) that the added overprotection circuity does not affect the function of the trigger board (recognition of a cartridge and the USB connection) (2) that the Analyzer performs up to 10,000 cycles within the current specifications, and (3) to verify general functionalities of the InfoWiFi module.
