antibiotic/organism combination(s):   
Tetracycline (te01n): Streptococcus dysgalactiae equisimilis when the VITEK 2 MIC is $2 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$

# D Special Instrument Requirements:

VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials combined with the nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with $0 . 4 5 \%$ to

$0 . 5 0 \%$ saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System will automatically (or allow operator to manually) dilute the bacterial suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then, the VITEK 2 will fill, seal and place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing, and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time. The analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based on attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the antimicrobial agent. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.

VITEK 2 Streptococcus Tetracycline has the following concentrations in the card: 0.125, 0.5, 1 and $4 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in $\mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m L }$ ). The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 Streptococcus Tetracycline is $\leq 0 . 2 5 - \geq 1 6 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

# B Principle of Operation:

The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems use visible light to directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells. Transmittance optics is based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Every 15 minutes throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based on the VITEK 2 card), light transmittance readings of each well determine organism growth by the amount of light that is prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of the incubation period, the MIC values and their associated interpretive category results for each antimicrobial on the test card are displayed in an automatically generated report.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

Refer to K111893. Reproducibility testing for the VITEK 2 Streptococcus Tetracycline was performed in support of clearance of K111893 and was determined acceptable.

2. Linearity: No applicable

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference: Not applicable.

4. Assay Reportable Range: Not applicable.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

Quality Control (QC) testing, Inoculum and Growth failure for the VITEK 2 Streptococcus Tetracycline was performed in support of clearance of K111893 and was determined acceptable. QC testing specific to the changes in breakpoints was not performed in the current submission.

The QC organism recommended by both the FDA and CLSI, namely Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, was tested against tetracycline during the clinical study a minimum 20 times/site by the automatic and the manual dilution. The QC organism was tested by the VITEK 2 AST card and the reference broth microdilution method. The QC results for both the reference and test panels appeared to be acceptable.

At the time of the original submission (K111893), the QC range for S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 was $0 . 1 2 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . The recommended CLSI QC range for this strain changed to include lower concentrations with a range of $0 . 0 6 - 0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . However, the VITEK 2 MIC reporting range is $\leq 0 . 2 5 - \geq 1 6 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . The VITEK 2 systems do not provide results lower than $0 . 2 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . Therefore, QC results for $S .$ pneumoniae ATCC 49619 may be off scale. An MIC value of ${ \underline { { < 0 . 2 5 } } }$ $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ indicated that the quality control test results were acceptable (Table 1).

Table 1. Quality Control Results for VITEK 2 (Auto-Dilution and Manual Dilution Methods) and VITEK 2 Compact (Manual Dilution Method)   
1 VITEK 2 Card range is $\leq 0 . 2 5 - \geq 1 6 .$ . The lowest dilution of the VITEK 2 Streptococcus Tetracycline MIC range is $\leq 0 . 2 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . Obtaining this value was considered an indicator that the quality control test results were acceptable.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

The VITEK 2 Streptococcus Tetracycline $( \leq 0 . 2 5 - \geq 1 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ ) which was originally cleared in K11893, included indications for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Beta-Hemolytic streptococci) and Streptococcus spp. (Viridans Group) tested with the VITEK 2 auto dilution and the VITEK 2 manual dilution and compared to the CLSI broth microdilution reference method.

The performance of the VITEK 2 AST-ST Tetracycline card with Streptocococcus pnuemoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Beta-hemolytic streptococci) and Streptococcus spp. (BetaHemolytic Group) using revised interpretive criteria currently recognized by FDA was evaluated in the current submission using data obtained in support of K111893. Streptococcus spp. (Viridans Group) is no longer recognized by FDA STIC webpage and these data were removed from analysis.

Since there was no change in the design or the dilution range of the VITEK 2 AST-ST card, the performance evaluation was achieved via re-analysis of the MIC data of the original 510(k) submission (K111893). An additional 63 beta-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. (not including S. pyogenes) challenge organisms were tested and performance was assessed in this submission to determine performance for this indication. For this review, the current Tetracycline interpretive criteria are applied to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus spp. $\beta$ -Hemolytic Group according to the FDA STIC webpage.

A total of 1127 (clinical and challenge) Streptococcus spp. isolates were tested using the VITEK 2 with automatic dilution. The isolates included 964 clinical isolates and 163 challenge isolates.

Results of the re-analyzed 1127 Streptococcus spp. clinical and challenge isolates (including 289 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 308 Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Beta-Hemolytic streptococci) and 530 Streptococcus spp. Beta-Hemolytic Group (other than S. pyogenes) are summarized in Table 2.

The previously-collected data for the 163 challenge isolates tested at a single site with the VITEK 2 and the VITEK 2 Compact Systems using the manual dilution was also analyzed using the current breakpoints for Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Streptococcus spp. BetaHemolytic Group (other than S. pyogenes). The results of the analysis are outlined in Table 3.

When applying the new breakpoints of ${ \le } 1$ (S), 2 (I), ${ \ge } 4$ (R), the performance of Streptococcus pneumoniae challenge isolates tested with the manual dilution and the VITEK 2 and the VITEK 2 Compact systems is acceptable with $\%$ EA and $\% { \mathrm { C A } } { > } 9 0 \%$ . There were no very major errors, no major errors and no minor errors observed with both the VITEK 2 and the VITEK 2 Compact out of 50 challenge isolates tested (Table 3).

When applying the new breakpoints of ${ \le } 2$ (S), 4 (I), ${ \ge } 8$ (R), the performance of Streptococcus pyogenes challenge isolates tested with the manual dilution and the VITEK 2 and the VITEK 2 Compact systems is acceptable with $\%$ EA and $\% \mathrm { C A } { > } 9 0 \%$ . There were no very major errors, no major errors and no minor errors observed with both the VITEK 2 and the VITEK 2 Compact out of 50 challenge isolates tested (Table 3).

When applying the new breakpoints of ${ \le } 2$ (S), 4 (I), ${ \ge } 8$ (R) for Streptococcus spp. (BetaHemolytic Group other than S. pyogenes) challenge isolates tested with the manual dilution and the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact systems is acceptable with $\%$ EA and $\% { \mathrm { C A } } { > } 9 0 \%$ . There were no very major errors and no major errors observed. One (1) minor error out of 63 isolates $( 1 . 6 \% )$ tested was observed for the VITEK 2 Compact system (Table 3).

As required under 511A(2) (2) (B) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the following statement was included under Precautions Section in the device labeling:

Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the safety and efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested by this AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those found in the indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of susceptibility information in those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for specific antimicrobial drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is approved.

# Trending

A trending re-analysis was performed using the combined (challenge and clinical) data obtained in K111893 from the VITEK 2 auto-dilution method for all Streptococcus spp. to align with current trending analysis.

This trending calculation takes into account the MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or higher than the reference method irrespective of whether the device MIC values are on-scale or not. Results that are not clearly at least one dilution lower, at least one dilution higher or in exact agreement with the CLSI reference method are not considered int the trending analysis.

When the difference between the percentage of isolates with higher vs. lower readings was $>$ $30 \%$ and for which the confidence interval was determined to be statistically significant were considered to show evidence of trending. Trending that showed higher or lower MIC values compared to the reference is addressed in the labeling.

No trending was observed with Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes (Group A BetaHemolytic streptococci) and Streptococcus spp. (Beta-Hemolytic Group other than S. pyogenes) (Table 4).

# VIII Proposed Labeling:

The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device when evaluated with the current FDA-recognized Tetracycline breakpoints.

# IX Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.

To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage (https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971. htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux intends to use to evaluate the VITEK 2 System with Tetracycline when revised breakpoints for Tetracycline are published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included with the submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, bioMérieux will update the Tetracycline device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
