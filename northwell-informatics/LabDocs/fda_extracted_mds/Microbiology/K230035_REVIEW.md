# A Device Description:

BioSci Disposable Virus Sampling Tube includes a screw-cap tube containing transport medium which is divided into two formats – in kit and tube.

The format in kit is supplied in pre-packaged collection sets containing one of the two swab types:

1. Minitip $2 . 5 \mathrm { m m }$ tip) flocking swab with $8 \mathrm { c m }$ breaking point, for nasopharyngeal specimen collection   
2. Regular (5 mm tip) flocking swab with $3 \mathrm { c m }$ breaking point, for oropharyngeal specimen collection

The screw-cap tube in kit format is pre-filled with 1 or $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of transport medium for safe transportation of biological specimen. The format in tube only contains labeled screw-cap tubes pre-filled with $1 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ , $1 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ , $2 \mathrm { m L }$ , and $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of transport medium.

The different configurations of BioSci Disposable Virus Sampling Tube are provided in table 1.

# B Principle of Operation:

The BioSci Disposable Virus Sampling Tube is used to safely collect and transport of clinical specimens containing viruses or chlamydiae from collection sites to the testing laboratories. The transport media is packaged alone or with one of two swabs. Swabs are comprised of a solid molded plastic applicator shaft and the tip of the applicator is flocked and either a regular $( 5 \mathrm { m m } )$ tip or a mini $( 2 . 5 \mathrm { m m } )$ tip. After collecting specimens using the swab, the swab is put into the preservation tube for storage and transportation, and subsequent testing. Sample collection is intended to be used by health care professionals. The BioSci Disposable Virus Sampling Tube medium is composed of Hank’s balanced salt solution, bovine serum albumin, glucose and the $\mathsf { p H }$ are buffered with HEPES buffer. Phenol red is used to indicate pH. Gentamicin and amphotericin B are incorporated into the medium to inhibit competing bacteria and fungi. The medium is isotonic and has been shown to be non-toxic to mammalian host cells.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference: Not applicable.

4. Assay Reportable Range: Not applicable.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

Shelf-life Stability:

The shelf life for the BioSci Disposable Virus Sampling Tube was determined to be 18 months from the date of manufacture when stored at temperature $2 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The shelf life of the BioSci Disposable Virus Sampling Tube was established using real-time aging performance test at time points $\mathrm { T } = 0$ , 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months. Three lots of the BioSci Disposable Virus Sampling Tube were evaluated for appearance, net content, $\mathsf { p H }$ value, bacteriostasis, sterility and recovery study at each time point in the real-time aging performance test.

a. Shelf-Life, Appearance, Net content, and pH Value:

The shelf-life stability was conducted by visual inspection with the following criteria: the package should be intact without damage and no leakage of liquid; the media should appear to be a red and transparent without any color change, turbidity, or obvious precipitation. All lots tested at each time point passed the criteria for appearance.

Net content stability was evaluated by measuring the volume of transport medium. The net content should not be less than the labeled volume. All the tubes tested in time points (1, 3, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months) meet the criteria for volume content. The $\mathsf { p H }$ stability of the transport medium was determined through testing of five replicates from each lot at each of the following time points (1, 3, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months). For all the tubes at each time point, the pH was within the predefined $\mathsf { p H }$ range of $7 . 3 \pm 0 . 3$ .

# b. Sterility:

The BioSci Disposable Virus Sampling Tube is not claimed to be sterile nor is it intended to be sterilized by the end user. To decrease the chances of contamination the screw-cap tubes are sterilized by e-beam irradiation and the transport medium is filled aseptically under control conditions.

The results for appearance, net content, and $\mathsf { p H }$ value, collectively support the claim for 18 months of storage for the BioSci Disposable Virus Sampling Tube at $2 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

6. Detection Limit:

# Performance Testing - Recovery Studies:

Performance of the BioSci Disposable Virus Sampling Tube was evaluated by Culture-Based Recovery Studies for viruses and chlamydiae. For Viral Recovery Studies, Fluorescent Foci Count method was utilized to evaluate the recovery of Adenovirus (ATCC VR-1), Cytomegalovirus (ATCC VR-977), Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (ATCC VR-260) and Influenza A (ATCC VR-1736). This method was also utilized to evaluate the recovery of Chlamydia pneumoniae (ATCC VR-1360). Performance evaluation was carried out in four lots of media that represent newly manufactured media and older media (about to expire or recently expired).

Virus stocks were diluted into two different dilutions in pooled negative clinical matrix and each dilution was inoculated into swab in triplicate and placed into BioSci Disposable Virus Sampling Tube to store at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $2 0 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 0 and 48 hours respectively. At each time point following inoculation, each sample was vortexed, and an aliquot was taken for recovery study using suitable tissue culture medium and host cells. For tissue culture, host cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and allowed to adhere for 24 – 48 hours. MRC-5 cells (SCSP-5040) were used for Adenovirus and Cytomegalovirus, Vero cells (GNO10) for Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1, and MDCK cells (GNO23) for Influenza A. Aliquot of 100 microliter $( \mu \mathrm { L } )$ virus suspensions prepared in gradient dilutions in triplicate were added on the monolayer plate. After incubation, specific immunofluorescent antibody staining was used for detection. For Chlamydia recovery, McCoy cells (ATCC CRL-1696) were used.

The number of infectious particles were counted as Fluorescent Foci and average recovery was calculated as mean of foci count per inoculum volume into 96-well plate $( 0 . 0 5 \mathrm { m L } )$ for each storage temperature and time points. The changes (any increase or decrease) in the recovery between timepoints (0 to $4 8 \ \mathrm { h r }$ ) were presented in percent values (negative for decrease and positive for increase). Any change that was within one log difference $( + / - 9 0 \% )$ was considered acceptable. Results were combined for all the lots irrespective of age as all changes were acceptable. The results are presented in the Table 2 and 3.

Conclusion: The BioSci Disposable Virus Sampling Tube demonstrated the recovery of tested viruses at an acceptable rate (Adenovirus, Cytomegalovirus, HSV Type 1 and Influenza A), and Chlamydia pneumoniae at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ up to 48 hours. Based on these results, the following statement was added to the package insert.

Better recovery of viruses and chlamydiae are achieved when specimens are processed shortly after the time of collection and within 48 hours of collection when transported at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ compared to $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .
