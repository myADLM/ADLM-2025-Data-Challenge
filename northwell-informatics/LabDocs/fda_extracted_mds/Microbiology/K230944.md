# Device Description

The MeMed $\mathsf { B V } @$ (“BV test” or the “test”) is an In-Vitro-Diagnostic device that measures in parallel the blood concentrations of TRAIL, IP-10 and CRP. The test consists of an automated analyzer with built-in hardware and software that conduct chemiluminescence based analyte measurements of patient serum and venous whole blood samples and their computational integration (MeMed Key®), and a disposable cartridge that contains the reagents and controls needed to detect the analytes of interest (MeMed $\mathsf { B V } ^ { \mathbb { \otimes } }$ cartridge). The test generates an answer to each sample, with a test run time of approximately 15 minutes.

# Intended Use / Indications for Use

The MeMed $\mathsf { B V } @$ test is an automated semi-quantitative immunoassay that measures three nonmicrobial (host) proteins (TRAIL, IP-10, and CRP) in adult and pediatric serum and venous whole blood samples and is intended for use in conjunction with clinical assessments and other laboratory findings as an aid to differentiate bacterial from viral infection. MeMed $\mathsf { B V } ^ { \mathbb { \otimes } }$ is indicated for use in patients presenting to the emergency department or urgent care center and with samples collected at hospital admission from patients with suspected acute bacterial or viral infection, who have had symptoms for less than seven days. The MeMed $\mathsf { B V } ^ { \mathbb { \otimes } }$ test generates a numeric score that falls within discrete interpretation bins based on the increasing likelihood of bacterial infection.

# Comparison with Predicate Device

The MeMed $\mathsf { B V } @$ is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, MeMed Diagnostics LTD. MeMed $\mathsf { B V } @$ (K222332). The FDA cleared MeMed $\mathsf { B V } @$ device has similar intended use and indications for use, as well as the same basic technological principles to the predicate device. The described changes in the indications for use (venous whole blood sample type) and technological characteristics (calibration scheme) are supported by the performance testing and do not raise any new questions of safety and efficacy. A substantial equivalence table summarizing the similarities and differences between the MeMed $\mathsf { B V } ^ { \otimes }$ and its predicate device is provided in the table below (MeMed Diagnostics, Ltd.’s MeMed $\mathsf { B V } ^ { \otimes }$ Test Substantial Equivalence Chart).

# Performance Data

# 1. Analytical performance:

The analytical performance testing supports the two newly introduced elements, the performance of the MeMed $\mathsf { B V } @$ test (serum) with the introduction of a new Master Calibration Curve (MCC) and the performance of the MeMed $\mathsf { B V } @$ test using venous WB specimen (also with the use of the new calibration scheme). For the first element (serum) only, the raw data that have been collected for previous analytical validation studies (K222332) were utilized for the re-calculation and re-analysis by applying the MCC.

# a. Limit of Quantitation

The Total Error and precision for the lowest concentration of each measurand that could be reliably measured (i.e., Limit of Quantification or LoQ) by the MeMed $\mathsf { B V } ^ { \mathbb { B } }$ Test was evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2, Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures. The study used two cartridge lots (per each test script; serum and whole blood) with one MeMed ${ \mathsf { K e y } } ^ { \mathbb { B } }$ analyzer and the samples described below. Each sample was tested three times on three non-consecutive days.

Table 2. Predefined acceptance criteria for LOQ

The TE (total error) was calculated for each of the four concentration levels for three analytes as $_ { 2 \times }$ SD (Standard Deviation) observed.

The results obtained for lower limit of quantification (“LLOQ”) testing for both the serum sample test script and the Whole Blood sample test script (each tested on two cartridge lots) are summarized in the two tables below.

The results for WB script test show that for all the tested samples, MeMed $\mathsf { B V } @$ test passed the acceptance criteria of TE. For the defined LLOQ concentration level of TRAIL, CRP, and IP10 (X1.0., TRAIL $1 5 \ : \mathsf { p g } / \mathsf { m L }$ , CRP $1 \mathrm { m g / L }$ , IP10 $1 0 0 \ : \mathsf { p g / m L } )$ the results achieved the following maximal TE values: TRAIL $10 \%$ , CRP $10 \%$ , and IP10 $14 \%$ .

# $b$ . Reproducibility/Precision:

The repeatability, intermediate precision and reproducibility studies for each measurand (TRAIL/IP10/CRP) of the MeMed $\mathsf { B V } ^ { \otimes }$ test were conducted using the MeMed Key® Analyzer. The MeMed $\mathsf { B V } ^ { \otimes }$ test score used a panel of 4 scores representing infectious bacteria, infectious virus, equivocal and noninfectious scores during the studies. Studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3 Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative Measurement Procedures.

The serum panel members representing the MeMed $\mathsf { B V } ^ { \otimes }$ test scores used for these studies are described below:

Table 5. Patient specimen panel members - Serum samples

The study was performed in three laboratories. At each site, a single operator preformed tests on two different analyzers using one cartridge lot. Each panel member was run in triplicates on each analyzer, on each day, over 5 non-consecutive days. Calibration was performed on the first day on each analyzer; one calibrator lot was used. External controls were run daily using one lot of ECs.

For each measurand, TRAIL, IP-10, and CRP, the acceptance criteria for measurements was $\mathsf { C V } \leq$ $15 \%$ . This acceptance criteria were not applicable to IP-10 and CRP concentration of healthy specimens since the concentrations were expected to be below the LoQ of IP-10 and CRP assays. The acceptance criterion for the MeMed $\mathsf { B V } ^ { \mathbb { \otimes } }$ test score was set at $\mathsf { S D } < 1 2 . 5$ score units.

The reproducibility results complied with the pre-established acceptance criteria for score and individual analytes.

Unlike serum specimens that can be collected and kept frozen and then thawed for Intermediate Precision (between days variance) or Reproducibility assessment (between sites variance), Whole Blood (WB) specimens are unstable and prone to hemolysis when undergoing a freeze-thaw cycle. Therefore, the WB specimens in this study were tested only as fresh sample and the testing protocol is set accordingly.

Each specimen was analyzed in four runs on five different analyzers using one cartridge lot. The study was performed in one laboratory with a single operator. Calibration was performed on the first day on each analyzer; one calibrator lot was used.

# c. Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility

A lot-to-lot reproducibility study was conducted to estimate lot-to-lot variance, for each MeMed $\mathsf { B V } ^ { \mathbb { B } }$ test measurand (TRAIL/IP-10/CRP) and the MeMed $\mathsf { B V } ^ { \mathbb { B } }$ test score for the four serum panel members as described above.

The lot-to-lot study was performed on 3 days with one operator at one site using three runs per day for each of the four serum panel members using two lots of cartridges on one MeMed Key® Analyzer. Two calibration lots were used, one for each cartridge lot. External controls were run daily using one lot of External Control reagents. Since no change in cartridge reagents was introduced, the validation using serum specimens applies also to venous whole blood sample type.

For each of TRAIL, IP-10, and CRP, the acceptance criterion for measurement was set at $C V \leq 1 5 \%$ . This acceptance criteria are not applicable to IP-10 and CRP concentration of healthy individual since it is expected to be below the LoQ of IP-10 and CRP assays. The acceptance criterion for the score was set at $\mathsf { S D } < 1 2 . 5$ score units.

The results of the lot-to-lot reproducibility study are summarized below.

# d. Linearity

Linearity of the MeMed BV test for each of the three measurands (TRAIL/IP-10/CRP) was evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP6-Ed2 Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures. The study was performed in one laboratory with one MeMed Key® Analyzer per cartridge lot, two lots of MeMed $\mathsf { B V } ^ { \otimes }$ cartridges, one lot of calibration reagents and one lot of External Control reagents. Calibration was performed before initiating the study for each cartridge lot. External Controls were run daily.

Five replicates of eleven dilutions of each MeMed $\mathsf { B V } @$ test measurand were measured in the linearity study. The order of measurement of the dilution series was random. Eleven dilutions were created by repeated pipetting of a single volume (Y) using a single pipette according to the table below.

The measured value was calculated as the average measured concentration of CRP/IP10/TRAIL at each level. Predicted value was established as the calculated value using the fit model at each level (in accordance with chapter 3.6, CLSI EP06 Ed2). The allowable deviation from linearity criterion (ADL) was set to be less than $1 5 \%$ or $1 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ for CRP, $1 5 \%$ or $1 0 \ p \mathsf { g / m L }$ for TRAIL and $20 \%$ or $5 0 ~ { \mathsf { p } } { \mathsf { g } } / { \mathsf { m L } }$ for IP-10 of the value corresponding to the linear fit (predicted).

For the serum sample testing the measurement procedure shows linearity for all analytes for the interval tested, with deviation from linearity within acceptance criteria.

Lot 1: The maximum observed $\%$ deviation from linearity is $6 . 8 \%$ in TRAIL assay.

Lot 2: The maximum observed $\%$ deviation from linearity is $- 6 . 6 \%$ in CRP assay.

For the Whole Blood sample testing, the measurement procedure shows linearity for all analytes for the interval tested, with deviation from linearity within acceptance criteria.

Lot 1: The maximum observed $\%$ deviation from linearity is $7 . 1 \%$ in TRAIL assay.

Lot 2: The maximum observed $\%$ deviation from linearity is $8 . 6 \%$ in TRAIL assay.

e. Hook Effect

This study was executed using Whole Blood test script. Since the workflow for the serum MeMed BV test was not modified, retest for serum sample type was not required.

A recombinant sample where each analyte was present at the upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ, sample #1) was used as well as three additional samples where each analyte was present at higher concentrations (samples 2-4).

The samples were prepared by spiking protein rich buffer with each of the three measurands (recombinant proteins). This approach was used to generate Sample 1 and 4 as indicated the table below. Sample 2 was prepared by mixing Sample 1 and 4 samples in a ratio of $_ { 2 / 3 }$ and $1 / 3$ , respectively. Sample 3 sample was prepared by mixing Level 1 and 4 samples in a ratio of $1 / 3$ and

2/3, respectively. For each concentration level, 3 runs were measured on one MeMed Key® Analyzer, on the same day.

Hook effect was determined to be excluded if the responses obtained for concentrations up to level 4 were no less than the response obtained for upper limit of quantification (ULoQ). If one or more of the assessed concentration levels deviated from this criterion, hook effect concentration was established as the lowest concentration for which the obtained response was lower than the response corresponding to ULoQ.

For each concentration level the average relative light unit (RLU) signal was calculated and compared against the average response obtained for sample 1 (ULOQ). The results are summarized in the table below.

All the concentrations levels show a higher signal than the signal obtained for sample 1 ULOQ. This means that no hook effect is observed for concentrations up to TRAIL – 1,000 pg/mL, IP-10 – 10,000 $\mathsf { p g } / \mathsf { m L }$ , and CRP – $- 5 0 0 \mathsf { m g } / \mathsf { L }$ .

# f. Carry over

Carry over was previously evaluated as part of the prior $5 1 0 ( \mathsf { k } )$ submission (K222332). Since the workflow for the serum MeMed BV test was not modified, retest for serum sample type was not required.

Because each specimen tested with the MeMed BV test is processed in a separate disposable cartridge and within the cartridge, each one of the three immunoassays is processed using a separate disposable filtered tip, with a unique tip dedicated to each measurand, the likelihood of carry over between specimens is negligible. For venous whole blood sample type a carry-over study was, nonetheless, conducted to address the low risk of potential carry over.

Sequential runs of (“L”) and high score $( " H " )$ clinical samples were used in the study. No carry-over was assessed based on 1) the difference between average score of high score sample ran after low score sample and high score sample baseline average score of no more than 12.5 score units; and 2) the difference between average score of low score sample ran after high score sample and low score sample baseline average score of no more than 12.5 score units.

Two whole blood (WB) samples were run in two sequences 1 and 2 of high to low scores and low to high scores, each sequence on a different MeMed Key® analyzer: The high to low score and lo to high score are represented in the tables below.

The maximal difference in score obtained for high score sample (1.4 score unit difference) demonstrates that no carry-over occurred with the MeMed BV test.

# g. Interference/Cross Reactivity

Interfering substances and cross-reactants were evaluated as part of the prior 510(k) submission (K222332). Since no change in cartridge reagents (antibody or assay formulation) was introduced, no repeated testing was conducted. The previously submitted data (K222332) shows that the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval for the bias lies within $+ / - 1 2 . 5$ score units for all the interferants and cross-reactants in the indicated concentrations for both bacterial and viral clinical samples. Thus, it can be concluded that there is no interference or cross-reactivity caused by the tested compounds at the indicated concentrations.

Interference of human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) was evaluated as part of the prior 510(k) submission (K222332). Since no change in cartridge reagents (antibody or assay formulation) was introduced, no repeated testing was conducted. The previously submitted data (K222332) shows that the recovery of TRAIL, IP-10 and CRP are within the predetermined $+ / -$ $10 \%$ of the sample nominal concentration. The results show that the three assays are tolerant to high HAMA concentrations.

i. Correlation to reference standard

Correlation between serum and WB has been assessed according to the clinical validation plan and covered in the Clinical Validation Report.

For the serum sample type, the purpose of this study was to verify that a strong correlation exists between the new calibration scheme (MCC) and the legacy calibration method. To that end, one hundred serum specimens with known TRAIL, CRP and IP-10 concentration were measured on both configurations on three analyzers, 1 repeat per analyzer. The study was designed in alignment with CLSI standard EP09-C 3rd edition (Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patients Samples, 3rd edition) and the following criteria were used:

1. The clinically relevant criterion is that in less than $5 \%$ of samples, the MCC scores deviate from the legacy calibration scores by an amount that would place the pair of scores in two non-adjacent bins.

2. The Pearson correlation between the MCC and the legacy calibration scores should be greater than   
0.95.

3. The accuracy requirements are that in the range of score values (0 through 100), the absolute bias incurred by using the MCC method and the legacy calibration method is less than 12.5 units at the “bin” cutoff points (10, 35, 65, 90).

Figure 1. Deming regression analysis $\left( \lambda { = } 1 \right)$

Deming regression analysis was conducted using 100 observation pairs. The ratio of error variances was set at $\lambda { = } 1$ . Confidence bands were computed using bootstrap samples and the “BCa”

The legacy calibration and the MCC methods can be considered equivalent methods for producing BV Scores for populations meeting the current indications for use of the BV Score for indicating bacterial versus viral infection.

This claim is with respect to both the clinically relevant criterion of pairs of scores not falling in nonadjacent bins, as well as the requirements based on the methodology for comparing measurement procedures.

For the serum-based test, as In-Use stability is an inherent property of the sample type, the originally established stability (submitted under K210254) remains. For the venous whole blood sample type, In in-use stability study was conducted to demonstrate the allowable handling conditions from blood draw to sample input into the cartridge. Stability was assessed for each MeMed BV test measurand (TRAIL/IP-10/CRP) and the MeMed BV test resulting score for four patient whole-blood panel members representing two samples with ‘low’ scores and two samples with ‘high’ scores as described in the table below.

The study was performed in one laboratory on four days, one day per panel member. Two MeMed ${ \mathsf { K e y } } ^ { \mathbb { B } }$ analyzers and one lot of cartridges were used. Calibration was performed at the beginning of the study using one lot of calibration reagents.

For each panel member, the incubations listed the table below were performed with the package insert indicated K2-EDTA tube before centrifugation and testing with the MeMed $\mathsf { B V } ^ { \mathbb { B } }$ Test. There was one run for each time point performed in parallel on two MeMed ${ \mathsf { K e y } } ^ { \mathbb { B } }$ analyzers.

The mean values, regression lines, confidence intervals and significance level of the difference of the slope from 0 were examined for each of the incubation times. The results show that the minimal acceptable period of time was obtained for TRAIL viral sample 1 of approximately 140 minutes. The formal in-use stability of WB sample type is established to be 120 minutes prior testing on analyzer.

k. Freeze-thaw stability

A study was conducted to validate stability between fresh and frozen serum specimens and was submitted as part of the original 510(k) submission (K210254).

Importantly, venous whole blood samples are not intended to be frozen, hence such study was not conducted for this sample type.

l. Calibrator Traceability

The company conducted metrological traceability testing of the MeMed $\mathsf { B V } ^ { \otimes }$ multi-standard calibrator material to ensure that analytical results used for patient care are accurate as well as consistent over time and when using different devices and systems. There was no change in the process that was provided in the original 510(k) submission for the MeMed BV $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ (K210254) except for the introduction of Master calibration curve performed by the manufacturer. Both the master calibrator and user calibrator product are traceable to same secondary and primary reference standards discussed in K210254.

m. Calibrator, External Controls, and Cartridges Stability Testing

MeMed BV calibrators (i.e., CAL1, CAL2, and CAL3), external controls (ECs), and cartridges were previously subjected to real time stability, in-use stability, transportation stability, shelf life validation, stability monitoring, and calibration interval testing (for ECs and calibrators only) in order to show that they maintain their respective performance characteristics over a defined time interval under indicated storage conditions. MeMed BV cartridges were also subjected to calibration interval testing.

The results of this testing were submitted as part of the prior 510(k) submission (K210254 and K222332) and demonstrated that the calibrators, ECs have a shelf life of 3.5 months and the cartridges have a shelf life of 12 months.

Since no change in reagent composition of cartridge, calibrators and external controls was introduced, no repeated testing was conducted.

# Clinical Studies

# 1. Perseverance Clinical Study

The analytical equivalency of the expanded indication MeMed $\mathsf { B V } ^ { \mathbb { B } }$ test was established by a prospective, multi-center study (“Perseverance). The Perseverance study was designed following guidance provided in h CLSI standard EP35Ed1E (Assessment of Equivalence or Suitability of Specimen Types) and EP09Ed3cE (Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation) and included 216 prospectively recruited subjects from 5 medical centers (2 in the US and 3 in Israel). The study population comprised hospital admitted, emergency department, and urgent care center patients over the age of 90 days, with clinical suspicion of acute bacterial or viral infection. The bins used in the study correspond to the below table. Most patients $( 6 6 . 2 \% )$ yielded BV scores falling in the outer bins $\mathrm { 0 } \leq \mathsf { s } \leq 1 0$ and $9 0 \leq \mathsf { s } \leq 1 0 0$ , bins 1 and 5). The bin with the lowest representation was bin 2 (10 $<$ score ${ < } 3 5$ ) with 22 patients, $1 0 . 2 \%$ of study population.

The clinical validation report includes three studies: a matrix equivalency study comparing scores measured from paired serum and whole blood samples; a study analyzing the impact of whole blood sample type on score bin assignment and associated test interpretation; and a study simulating the impact of whole blood sample type on the diagnostic accuracy of the test in the Apollo study (NCT04690569), where performance was assessed in comparison to a rigorous reference standard based on etiological adjudication by experts provided with comprehensive patient data. The data from the Apollo study were the basis for the clearance of MeMed BV for serum samples (K210254).

Demonstrating the equivalence of MeMed BV® score in paired venous whole blood and serum samples

# Matrix equivalency study

The primary endpoint of analytical equivalency required attainment of the following pre-defined acceptance criteria based on Passing & Bablok regression analysis:

 Slope in the range of 0.9-1.1

Intercept in the range of (-5) to 5

Passing& Bablok regression analysis of the BV scores measured in serum versus venous whole blood yielded a slope of 1.00, $9 5 \%$ CI 0.99-1.00 and intercept of 0.00, $9 5 \%$ CI 0.00-0.06, fulfilling both predefined acceptance criteria for analytical equivalency. Therefore, BV score measurements conducted using paired serum and venous whole blood samples run on MeMed Key® were established as analytically equivalent.

Figure 3. Analytical equivalency of score measurements from serum and whole blood samples

# Bin impact analysis

in addition to examining the analytical equivalency of BV scores measured using paired serum versus whole blood samples, the potential impact of sample type on score assignment to bins was assessed for the study population of the Perseverance study. The acceptance criteria were pre-defined as less than $5 \%$ of the paired serum and whole blood samples from the Perseverance study demonstrating a score deviation that causes a patient to be assigned to a nonadjacent bin.

Results demonstrated that were no paired samples demonstrating a score deviation that caused the patient to be assigned to a nonadjacent bin.

This bin impact analysis strengthens the conclusion that measurements conducted using paired serum and venous whole blood samples run on MeMed Key® are analytically and clinically equivalent.

# Comparison to adjudication-based reference standard

A third analysis was performed to assess the impact of matrix difference on performance against an adjudication-based reference standard. For this purpose, BV score and reference standard data from the Apollo study (NCT04690569, clinical study supporting the original MeMed BV submission K210254) were analyzed via simulation. Specifically, serum measurements from the Apollo study were converted to whole blood measurements using multiple simulations that allow for variability in the conversion based on the observed bias and coefficient of variance. The simulated whole blood measurements were then compared to the adjudication-based reference standard (conducted both for the primary all-inclusive and secondary suspected cohorts).

Diagnostic accuracy was assessed by establishing that the probability of bacterial infection is an increasing function of the BV score (as output by whole blood simulations).

The acceptance criteria for this analysis are similar to the acceptance criteria used for the Apollo study, to support the original MeMed BV (Serum) clearance (K210254):

The Cochran–Armitage (CA) Test for trend with a 2-sided $5 \%$ level of significance will be used   
to reject the null hypothesis that there is no trend of increasing probability of bacterial infection with higher test score for at least $9 5 \%$ of simulations   
Likelihood Ratio (LR) with $9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval (CI) should exclude 1 for some bins (preferably Bins 1,2,4,5) for at least $9 5 \%$ of simulations

The diagnostic accuracy of the simulated whole blood BV scores passed both acceptance criteria for the all-inclusive and suspected cohorts.

For the all-inclusive cohort, the Cochran–Armitage p-value was significant $( \mathsf { p } { < } 0 . 0 0 1 )$ ) for a $100 \%$ of the 100K simulations and the CI of the LR of exactly 4 bins (specifically bins 1,2,4 and 5) excluded 1 in $100 \%$ of the simulations.   
For the suspected cohort, the Cochran–Armitage p-value was significant $( \mathsf { p } { < } 0 . 0 0 1 $ for a $100 \%$ of the 100K simulations and the CI of the LR of exactly 4 bins (specifically bins 1,2,4 and 5) excluded 1 in $9 9 . 9 8 \%$ of the simulations. In $0 . 0 2 \%$ of the simulations, the CI of the LR of all 5 bins excluded 1.

The study successfully passed the pre-defined acceptance criteria, validating the diagnostic accuracy of simulated whole blood sample measurements.

In conclusion, the MeMed $\mathsf { B V } @$ Whole Blood Clinical Validation documents the results of three studies that together were designed to demonstrate the clinical performance of the proposed modified MeMed BV device in support of expanding the indications for use of the previously cleared MeMed BV (K222332) to include whole blood samples.

# Conclusions

Analytical and clinical performance data demonstrate that the proposed modified MeMed $\mathsf { B V } @$ (with the extended indication for the use of venous whole blood and modified calibration scheme) is as safe and effective as the FDA Cleared MeMed $\mathsf { B V } @$ (K222332). In addition, the technological differences between the proposed modified MeMed $\mathsf { B V } @$ test and its predicate devices (K222332) raise no new issues of safety or effectiveness. Thus, the MeMed $\mathsf { B V } @$ with the extended indication for the use of venous whole blood is substantially equivalent.
