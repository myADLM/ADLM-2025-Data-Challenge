# Special Conditions for Use Statement:

For Prescription Use Only For in vitro diagnostic use only

# Special Instrument Requirements:

BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System and BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 for BD MAX™ System are performed on the BD MAX™ System.

# Device Description

The BD Respiratory Viral Panel (BD RVP) and BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 (BD RVPSCV2) along with the BD MAXTM System are comprised of an instrument with associated hardware and accessories, disposable microfluidic cartridges, master mixes, unitized reagent strips, and extraction reagents. The instrument automates sample preparation including target lysis, Total Nucleic Acid (TNA) extraction and concentration, reagent rehydration, target nucleic acid amplification and detection using real-time PCR. The assay includes a Sample Processing Control (SPC) that is present in the Extraction Tube. The SPC monitors RNA extraction steps, thermal cycling steps, reagent integrity and the presence of inhibitory substances. The BD $\mathbf { M A X T M }$ System software automatically interprets test results. For the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System and BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 for BD MAX™ System, a test result may be called as POS, NEG or UNR (Unresolved) based on the amplification status of the targets and of the Sample Processing Control. IND (Indeterminate) or INC (Incomplete) results are due to BD MAX™ System failure.

# Test Principle

The BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System and BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 for BD MAX™ System assays are designed for use with a nasopharyngeal or anterior nasal swabs collected in BD Universal Viral Transport System (UVT) or Copan Universal Transport Media System (UTM). Once collected, the UVT/UTM patient sample is vortexed and 750ul is transferred to the BD Molecular RVP Sample Buffer Tube (SBT) provided with the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System. placed in the BD MAX™ System. For all sample types the SBTs are vortexed and then loaded into the BD MAX system along with the Unitized Reagent Strips, Master Mix, Extraction Tubes, and PCR Cartridges. No further operator intervention is necessary.

The BD RVP Unitized Reagent Strip contains a combination of lytic and extraction reagents designed to perform cell lysis and TNA extraction. Nucleic acids released from the target organisms are captured on magnetic affinity beads. The beads, together with the bound nucleic acids, are washed and the nucleic acids are eluted by a combination of heat and $\mathsf { p H }$ variation. Eluted TNA is added to neutralization buffer, mixed, and transferred to BD Respiratory Viral Panel master mix for rehydration. After reconstitution, the BD MAX™ System dispenses a fixed volume of RT-PCR-ready solution containing extracted nucleic acids into the PCR Cartridge. Microvalves on the cartridge are sealed by the system prior to initiating PCR in order to contain the amplification mixture and thus prevent evaporation and contamination.

The amplified cDNA targets are detected using hydrolysis (TaqMan $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ) probes, labeled at one end with a fluorescent reporter dye (fluorophore), and at the other end, with a quencher moiety. Probes labeled with different fluorophores are used to detect the target analytes in different optical channels of the BD MAX™ System. When the probes are in their native state, the fluorescence of the fluorophore is quenched due to its proximity to the quencher. However, in the presence of target cDNA, the probes hybridize to their complementary sequences and are hydrolyzed by the $5 ' - 3 '$ exonuclease activity of the DNA polymerase as it synthesizes the nascent strand along the cDNA template. As a result, the fluorophores are separated from the quencher molecules and fluorescence is emitted. The amount of fluorescence detected in the optical channels is directly proportional to the quantity of the corresponding probe that is hydrolyzed. The BD MAX™ System monitors these signals at each cycle of the PCR and interprets the data at the end of the reaction to provide qualitative test results for each analyte.

# Substantial Equivalence1

# Indication for Use Comparison:

The BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System and BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 for BD MAX™ System have a similar intended use as their predicate device, except for fewer targeted analytes in the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System as opposed to the BioFire Respiratory Panel 2.1 (RP2.1), DEN200031. All BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System analytes are included in the BioFire Respiratory Panel 2.1 (RP2.1). The BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 for BD MAX™ System has the same analyte target as the BioFire COVID-19 Test 2, K211079/K221460.

# Technological Comparison:

The BD MAX™ Assays have similar principle of operation as their predicate, the BioFire Respiratory Panel 2.1 (RP2.1), DEN200031, and BioFire COVID-19 Test 2, K211079/K221460. All assay reagent kits contain the materials required to complete tests and includes the hydration solution, sample buffer, and sample handling components such as transfer pipettes. All assays, subject devices and predicates, are used to test patient samples in a closed system that stores all the necessary reagents for sample preparation reverse transcription, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and detection in order to isolate, amplify, and detect nucleic acid from multiple pathogens. Minor differences can be observed in the detection chemistry where the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System and the BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 for BD MAX™ System utilize paired reporter and quencher fluorescence labeled probes (TaqMan Technology) as opposed to the BioFire Respiratory Panel 2.1 (RP2.1) and BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 which utilize a two Step Nested multiplex PCR where sequences from the first RT-PCR/PCR are amplified using fluorescence double stranded binding dye. The minor differences between the subject and predicate devices do not raise any new questions of safety or effectiveness.

Table 1 provides the similarities and differences between the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System and BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 for BD MAX™ System, respectively, in comparison to their predicate devices.

# Limit of Detection (LoD)

The analytical sensitivity of the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System was assessed in both nasopharyngeal and nasal clinical matrix across seven respiratory viruses. LoD studies determine the lowest detectable concentration of virus at which approximately $9 5 \%$ of all (true positive) replicates test positive. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 was completed with a Probit statistical methodology. Analysis of three strains of influenza A (H1N1/Brisbane,

H1N1(pdm09)/Guangdong-Maonan, and H3N2/Kansas), influenza B (Colorado and Phuket/3073/13), RSV A and RSV B was completed with a limiting dilution with 3-fold serial dilutions between each level. A minimum of five determination levels and one negative level across three (3) reagent lots were tested. Confirmation of the estimated LoD was performed with one reagent lot in replicates of 20 prepared in nasopharyngeal and nasal matrix and are reported in Table 7. To confirm that the co-spiking of analytes does not impact analytical sensitivity, the LoD was also confirmed with one strain per analyte.

# Inclusivity

An in silico alignment of the BD Respiratory Viral Panel primers and probes demonstrated that the performance of the BD Respiratory Viral Panel reagents for the BD MAX™ system is not directly impacted by the presence of mutations in known SARS-CoV-2 viral variants. As of June 10, 2022, BD continues to monitor all lineages and sublineages for the following WHO labeled Variants of Concern, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Mu. In all cases greater than $9 9 \%$ of the sequenced isolates are a perfect match to all primers and probes in either the N1 or N2 set. Given similar performance from both the N1 and N2 channel, either will back up the other in the event of performance degradation through genetic drift. Additionally, BD continues to monitor all lineages of the WHO Omicron label, including sublineages within BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.3, BA.4, and BA.5. All Omicron genomes contain a mutation that affects the N1 probe 3 bases from the $5 '$ end. (Mutation C28311T). Each Omicron sub-lineage has a percentage of sequences that are a perfect match to either the N1 or N2 primer-set as follows: BA.1 at $9 9 . 4 7 \%$ , BA.2 at $9 8 . 9 5 \%$ , BA.2.12.1 at $9 9 . 6 3 \%$ , BA.3 at $100 \%$ , BA.4 at $9 6 . 8 7 \%$ and BA.5 at $9 9 . 5 5 \%$ .

An in-silico comparison of the influenza A primer set was performed using all available high quality Influenza A M1 (matrix protein) gene sequences submitted to the NCBI GenBank database as of January 02, 2022 $\scriptstyle ( \mathtt { n } = 4 4 , 4 6 8$ ). Multiple alignment of the matrix gene showed that $9 0 . 3 \%$ of sequences are a perfect match to the primer/probe set while an additional $9 . 5 \%$ of sequences have a single base mismatch in the $_ 5 \cdot$ end of a single primer. Multiple mismatches to the primers and probe occurred in only $0 . 2 \%$ of sequences.

An in-silico comparison of the influenza B primer sets was performed using all available high quality Influenza B M1 gene and HA gene sequences submitted to the NCBI GenBank database as of January 02, 2022. A total of 11,683 matrix and $1 8 { , } 5 5 9 \ \mathrm { H A }$ sequences were used in this analysis. Multiple alignment of the M1 gene showed that $9 7 . 1 \%$ of sequences are a perfect match to the primer/probe set and $7 6 . 7 \%$ of HA sequences are a perfect match.

An in-silico comparison of the RSV primer sets was performed using all available high quality RSV M gene and $_ \mathrm { N }$ gene sequences submitted to the NCBI GenBank database as of January 02, 2022 $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { N } = 3 , 4 4 3 )$ . Alignments against the $\mathbf { M }$ and $_ \mathrm { N }$ gene showed that the primer/probe sets are a perfect match to $8 3 . 0 \%$ of sequences in the database, $9 2 . 3 \%$ of the sequences were a perfect match to the M primer/probe set, and $9 0 . 1 \%$ were a perfect match to the $_ \mathrm { N }$ primer/probe set region. In total, $9 9 . 4 \%$ are a perfect match to either the M gene or the $_ \mathrm { N }$ gene primer sets.

BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System was evaluated against multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A H1N1 and H3N2, influenza B including both the Yamagata and Victoria lineages, and RSV including both A and B. A total of 11 SARS-CoV-2, 30 influenza A, 10 influenza B, and 5 RSV strains were evaluated at levels near the analytical LoD. Three replicates were tested for each strain.

# Assay Measuring Range

Not applicable. This is a qualitative assay.

# Interfering Substances

Twenty-three (23) biological and chemical substances that may be present in nasopharyngeal or anterior nasal swab specimens were evaluated for potential interference with the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System in the absence and presence of assay analytes (SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and RSV). Whole blood (human) was found to interfere at levels above $0 . 2 \%$ volume/volume for SARS-CoV-2. Results demonstrated no reportable interference from any other substance at the concentrations tested (refer to Table 9).

# Mixed Infection/Competitive Interference

To assess potential competitive interference between SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and RSV samples were tested in replicates of twenty (20) where low (approximately $2 \mathbf { x }$ their respective LoD) concentration of three analytes were mixed with high (approximately $1 . 0 0 \mathrm { E } { + 0 6 }$ genome copies $/ \mathrm { m L }$ in UVT) concentration of the other analyte. None of the analytes present at a very high concentration interfered with the detection of low levels of the other three analytes, refer to Table 10.

# Cross-Reactivity

An in silico analysis was performed to evaluate the potential for all primers and probes contained within the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD $\mathbf { M A X T M }$ System master mix to amplify and detect unintended organisms. Each primer was ‘BLAST’ against the full nt database and alignments were kept if there were no more than three (3) base pair mismatches across the length of the primer, the $_ { 3 } ,$ end of the primer matched the subject sequence, and no gaps were introduced to “force” an alignment. The plus/minus orientation between the primer (query) and the subject (database sequence) was determined, and all two-primer combinations (including each primer with itself) were identified where one primer matched the plus strand and the other matched the minus, representing potential amplicons. Amplicons were kept if the minus strand primer was downstream of the plus strand primer and the resulting amplicons were less than or equal to 3,000 base pairs long.

SARS-CoV-2: All identified hits are either SARS-CoV-2 or a closely related coronavirus from non-human species. No relevant cross-reactivity was discovered.

Influenza A: No relevant cross-reactivity was discovered.

Influenza B: No relevant cross-reactivity was discovered.

Respiratory syncytial virus: No relevant cross-reactivity was discovered.

Additionally, fifty-two (52) organisms and one (1) nasopharyngeal pool were evaluated for cross-reactivity with the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System. The bacterial cells, yeasts, and viruses were tested in the BD Molecular RVP Sample Buffer Tube. All organisms tested produced negative results when tested at the concentration listed in Table 11.

# Assay Cut-off

The assay cut-off for the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD ${ \bf M A X T M }$ was established based on PCR based metrics taken together by the BD MAX software algorithm to make the qualitative decision whether a curve is to be considered positive or negative. These metrics (e.g., Ct, RFU endpoints, signal-to-noise ratios) are initially set by default parameters defined by the instrument. As the product undergoes product development, the data is supplemented, and the algorithm is adjusted (“trained”) using viral cultures spiked into clinical background matrices at levels surrounding the limit of detection and expected clinical range. In conclusion, testing of clinical specimens were used to confirm adequate separation between the value observed in positive specimens in each target detection channel and the assay cutoff.

# Matrix Equivalency

Matrix Equivalency between nasopharyngeal swab, nasal swab, and simulated nasopharyngeal matrix was evaluated using heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA/2020 strain), influenza A (H1N1/Brisbane), influenza B (Phuket/3073/13) and RSV A culture fluids spiked into negative nasopharyngeal, nasal and simulated matrix to prepare contrived low positive (approximately 2x LoD) and moderate positive (approximately 5x LoD) samples for each sample type. A total of thirty (30) low positive, fifteen (15) moderate positive, and fifteen (15) negative samples were tested.

Simulated nasopharyngeal matrix was demonstrated to be equivalent to nasopharyngeal and nasal in UVT matrix

# Fresh vs Frozen

A study was performed with the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System using fresh and frozen nasopharyngeal swabs in UVT which showed that there were no adverse effects from freezing and thawing of specimens. The data generated are considered acceptable to support testing of archived, frozen specimens in the Clinical Study to evaluate the performance of the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System.

# Carryover / Cross-Contamination

A study was conducted to investigate within-run carryover and between-run carryover while processing samples with high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System. High positive samples contained heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 spiked into pooled nasal swab matrix at a concentration of ${ \geq } 1 . 9 4 \mathrm { E } { + } 0 7$ copies $/ \mathrm { m L }$ . The negative samples consisted of simulated nasopharyngeal matrix without any target analyte. Twelve (12) replicates of the high positive panel member and 12 replicates of the negative panel member were tested in nine (9) runs by alternating negative and positive samples, using three BD ${ \bf M A X T M }$ Systems. A total of 108 positive and 108 negative samples were tested. Of the 108 negative samples tested, one (1) false positive result was obtained $( 0 . 9 3 \%$ , $9 5 \%$ CI: $0 . 1 6 { - } 5 . 0 6 \%$ .

# Inclusivity

An in silico alignment of the BD Respiratory Viral Panel – SCV2 primers and probes demonstrated that the performance of the BD Respiratory Viral Panel – SCV2 reagents for the BD ${ \bf M A X T M }$ system is not directly impacted by the presence of mutations in known SARS-CoV-2 viral variants. As of June 10, 2022, BD continues to monitor all lineages and sublineages for the following WHO labeled Variants of Concern, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Mu. In all cases greater than $9 9 \%$ of the sequenced isolates are a perfect match to all primers and probes in either the N1 or N2 set. Given similar performance from both the N1 and N2 channel, either will back up the other in the event of performance degradation through genetic drift. Additionally, BD continues to monitor all lineages of the WHO Omicron label, including sublineages within BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.3, BA.4, and BA.5. All Omicron genomes contain a mutation that affects the N1 probe 3 bases from the $5 '$ end. (Mutation C28311T). Each Omicron sublineage has a percentage of sequences that are a perfect match to either the N1 or N2 primer-set as follows: BA.1 at $9 9 . 4 7 \%$ , BA.2 at $9 8 . 9 5 \%$ , BA.2.12.1 at $9 9 . 6 3 \%$ , BA.3 at $100 \%$ , BA.4 at $9 6 . 8 7 \%$ and BA.5 at $9 9 . 5 5 \%$ .

BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 for BD MAX™ System was evaluated against multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2. A total of 11 SARS-CoV-2 strains were evaluated at levels near the analytical LoD. Three replicates were tested for each strain, refer to Table 21.

# Cross-Reactivity

An in silico analysis was performed to evaluate the potential for all primers and probes contained within the BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 for BD ${ \bf M A X T M }$ System master mix to amplify and detect unintended organisms. Each primer was ‘BLAST’ against the full nt database and alignments were kept if there were no more than three (3) base pair mismatches across the length of the primer, the $_ 3 \cdot$ end of the primer matched the subject sequence, and no gaps were introduced to “force” an alignment. The plus/minus orientation between the primer (query) and the subject (database sequence) was determined, and all two-primer combinations (including each primer with itself) were identified where one primer matched the plus strand and the other matched the minus, representing potential amplicons. Amplicons were kept if the minus strand primer was downstream of the plus strand primer and the resulting amplicons were less than or equal to 3,000 base pairs long.

SARS-CoV-2: All identified hits are either SARS-CoV-2 or a closely related coronavirus from non-human species. No relevant cross-reactivity was discovered.

Additionally, fifty-two (52) organisms and one (1) nasopharyngeal pool were evaluated for cross-reactivity with the BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 for BD MAX™ System. The bacterial cells, yeasts, and viruses were tested in the BD Molecular RVP Sample Buffer Tube. All organisms tested produced negative results when tested at the concentration listed in Table 23.

# Assay Cut-Off

The assay cut-off for the BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 for BD MAX™ was established based on PCR based metrics taken together by the BD MAX software algorithm to make the qualitative decision whether a curve is to be considered positive or negative. These metrics (e.g., Ct, RFU endpoints, signal-to-noise ratios) are initially set by default parameters defined by the instrument. As the product undergoes product development, the data is supplemented, and the algorithm is adjusted (“trained”) using viral cultures spiked into clinical background matrices at levels surrounding the limit of detection and expected clinical range. In conclusion, testing of clinical specimens were used to confirm adequate separation between the value observed in positive specimens in each target detection channel and the assay cutoff.

# Matrix Equivalency

Equivalence between nasopharyngeal swab, nasal swab, and simulated nasopharyngeal matrix was evaluated using heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA/2020 strain) spiked into negative nasopharyngeal, nasal and simulated matrix to prepare contrived low positive (approximately $2 \mathbf { x }$ LoD) and moderate positive (approximately 5x LoD) samples for each sample type. A total of thirty (30) low positive, fifteen (15) moderate positive, and fifteen (15) negative samples were tested.

# Fresh vs Frozen

A study was performed with the BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 for BD MAX™ System using fresh and frozen nasopharyngeal swabs which showed that there were no adverse effects from freezing and thawing of specimens. The data generated are considered acceptable to support testing of archived, frozen specimens in the Clinical Study to evaluate the performance of the BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 for BD MAX™ System.

# Carryover / Cross-Contamination

A study was conducted to investigate within-run carryover and between-run carryover while processing samples with high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in the BD Respiratory Viral Panel – SCV2. High positive samples contained heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 spiked into pooled nasal swab matrix at a concentration of ${ \geq } 1 . 9 4 \mathrm { E } { + } 0 7$ copies/mL. The negative samples consisted of simulated nasopharyngeal matrix without any target analyte. Twelve (12) replicates of the high positive panel member and 12 replicates of the negative panel member were tested in nine (9) runs by alternating negative and positive samples, using three BD MAX™ Systems or a total of 108 positive and 108 negative samples tested. Of the 108 negative samples tested, one (1) false positive result was obtained $0 . 9 3 \%$ , $9 5 \%$ CI: $0 . 1 6 { - } 5 . 0 6 \%$ .

# Expected Values

In the BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 for BD MAX™ System clinical study, reportable results from specimens compliant at the specimen and PCR levels were obtained from 8 geographically diverse sites. Nasopharyngeal and nasal specimens totaled 1,562 and 1,566 respectively. The number and percentage of positive cases per target, as determined by BD Respiratory Viral PanelSCV2 for BD MAX™ System, are presented in Table 26.

# External Control Validation

Assay run controls are not provided as part of the BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 for BD MAX™ System. BD recommends the use of Microbiologics controls. Studies have been performed to verify the use of Microbiologics Helix Elite™ Molecular Standards with the BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 for BD MAX™ System. The combination of Microbiologics SARS-CoV-2 Positive Control as positive external control. Microbiologics Negative Cellularity Control (NCC) will be used as the external negative control.

# Usability Study

A usability study has been performed to determine whether a representative sample of untrained professionals could correctly prepare samples for the BD MAX Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System. The participants were presented with a representative mock sample, and all other materials required to process the mock sample. They were asked to go through simulating the assay preparation and perform every step as realistically as possible. The use scenario being studied in this evaluation was the expected use scenario that an intended user would go through when preparing samples for molecular assays in a clinical environment. The study demonstrated usability with the target user population for safe and effective use of the product.

# Clinical Performance Evaluation

# BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System Clinical Summary:

The performance of the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System was evaluated in comparison to a composite method of two out of three highly sensitive molecular assays (NAATs) that are FDA authorized under EUA for SARS-CoV-2. Any specimen that tested positive by two EUA assays was considered positive for SARS-CoV-2, whereas any specimen that tested negative by two EUA assays was considered negative. For influenza A, influenza B, and RSV, the performance of the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD $\mathbf { M A X T M }$ System was evaluated in comparison to an FDA-cleared high sensitivity RT-PCR assay.

# Prospective Clinical Evaluation

Clinical performance characteristics of the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System were established during a multi-center study where subjects were prospectively enrolled at six geographically distinct U.S. study sites and two geographically distinct sites in Europe from January up to August 2022. Four sites performed BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System testing and/or reference method testing. For consented adult or pediatric subjects presenting with symptoms of respiratory viral infection, one nasopharyngeal swab and/or one nasal swab were collected and placed in validated transport medium. From a total of 2,005 subjects enrolled, 1562 nasopharyngeal swabs and 1566 nasal swabs were included in the performance calculations. Between January and beginning of April 2022, specimens were prospectively collected from all comers meeting the study eligibility criteria and immediately frozen for later testing as prospective archived/frozen (Category II) specimens. Between mid-April up to August 2022, specimens were prospectively collected from all comers meeting the eligibility criteria and tested fresh as prospective fresh (Category I). For nasopharyngeal specimens, the numbers of compliant specimens with reportable comparator and BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System were 1,545 for SARS-CoV-2 and 1,562 for Flu A, Flu B, and RSV. For nasal specimens, the numbers of compliant specimens with reportable comparator and BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System were 1,561 for SARS-CoV-2 and 1,564 for Flu A, Flu B, and RSV. Table 27 provides a summary of demographic and vaccination information for the 1562 nasopharyngeal swabs and 1566 nasal swabs included in the performance calculations.

# Retrospective Clinical Evaluation

Clinical performance characteristics of the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System were determined from a total of 240 frozen retrospective nasopharyngeal swabs in UVT/UTM obtained from two (2) external sources with historical positive or negative results for either influenza B or RSV. The specimens were collected as part of routine patient care between December 2019 and January 2022. All the specimens were tested in a blinded and randomized fashion with the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX™ System at three different testing sites and reference method (RM) at one testing site. The RM for influenza B, and RSV was an FDAcleared high sensitivity RT-PCR assay. Table 30 provides a summary of demographic information for the 240 retrospective nasopharyngeal samples.
