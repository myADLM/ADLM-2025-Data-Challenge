# B Principle of Operation:

KaiBiLi Extended ViralTrans consists of modified Hank's balanced salt solution supplemented with bovine serum albumin, cysteine, glutamic acid, sucrose and HEPES. The HEPES buffer protects against $\mathsf { p H }$ changes. Phenol red is used as a $\mathsf { p H }$ indicator. Sucrose aids in the preservation of organism viability. To minimize the contamination of commensal organisms, Vancomycin, Econazole Nitrate, and Polymyxin B are incorporated into the medium formula.

Specimens need to be placed into the tube containing transport medium immediately after sample collection and submitted to the laboratory as soon as possible. It is recommended that 2- $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is the most appropriate temperature for specimen transportation.

# Shelf-life Stability:

The shelf life for the KaiBiLi Extended ViralTrans media was determined to be 12 months from the date of manufacture when stored at temperature $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $2 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The shelf-life of the KaiBiLi Extended ViralTrans media was established using real-time aging performance test at time points $\mathrm { T } { = } 0$ , 6, 9, 11, and 12 months. Three lots each of the KaiBiLi Extended ViralTrans media in the $1 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ and $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ configurations (a total of 6 lots) were evaluated for appearance, net volume, $\mathrm { p H }$ value, bacteriostasis, and sterility at each time point in the real-time aging performance test.

a. Shelf-life, Appearance, Bacteriostasis, Net volume, and pH value: The shelf-life stability was conducted by visual inspection with the following criteria: the media should be a clear transparent pink liquid; the media should have no turbidity, sediment, or color change. All lots tested at each time point passed the criteria for appearance.

The bacteriostasis ability of the transport media was evaluated by measuring for growth of microorganisms, spiked into the transport media, after 48 hours at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . No microorganism growth was observed and all lots tested at each time point passed the criteria for bacteriostasis.

Net volume stability was evaluated by measuring the volume of the transport media. The net volume should not fall outside the range of $2 . 7 { - } 3 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ for the $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ media configuration or $0 . 9 { - } 1 . 1 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ for the $1 \mathrm { m L }$ media configuration. All lots tested at each time point passed the criteria for net volume.

The $\mathsf { p H }$ stability of the transport media was determined by measuring the $\mathsf { p H }$ of the transport media. The $\mathsf { p H }$ value for each transport media at each time point should be within the $\mathsf { p H }$ range of 7.1-7.5. For all tubes at each time point, the $\mathsf { p H }$ value was within the predefined $\mathsf { p H }$ range and had an average of $7 . 2 2 \pm 0 . 2$ .

# b. Sterility:

The KaiBiLi Extended ViralTrans tube and media are not sold as sterile nor are they intended to be sterilized by the user. These vials are single use devices. To minimize contamination, the tubes are filled aseptically under control conditions. The swabs provided with the KaiBiLi Extended ViralTrans media are individually packaged and are sold as sterile.

The results for appearance, net volume, and $\mathsf { p H }$ value collectively support the claim for 12 months of storage for the KaiBiLi Extended ViralTrans media at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $2 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

6. Detection Limit:

# Performance Testing- Recovery Studies:

Performance of the KaiBiLi Extended ViralTrans media was evaluated using culture-based recovery studies for viruses and bacteria at different incubation times and temperatures.

For Recovery Studies, virus titer $\mathrm { ( T C I D _ { 5 0 } / m L ) }$ ) was quantified to evaluate the recovery of the following viruses in the corresponding matrices listed in Table 1 below: Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (ATCC VR-733; HSV-1), Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (ATCC VR-734; HSV-2), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (ATCC VR-26; RSV), Cytomegalovirus (ATCC VR977), Adenovirus (ATCC VR-3), Parainfluenza 3 (ATCC VR-93), Influenza A (ATCC VR822; Flu A), and Varicella Zoster Virus (ATCC VR-1832; VZV). Recovery of Chlamydophila pneumoniae (ATCC VR-2282) was evaluated using Fluorescent Foci Count method $\mathrm { ( I F U / m L }$ ). Recovery of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (ATCC 15531) and Ureaplasma urealyticum (ATCC 27618) was evaluated using the Swab Elution and Roll Plate methods (CFU/mL). Performance evaluation was carried out in three lots of media that represent newly manufactured, middle-aged, and recently expired media. Negative clinical matrix pools were contrived from a minimum of five donors. Matrix pools were determined to be negative prior to use in the specimen stability recovery studies.

1pooled swab-collected vaginal exudates; 2 pooled venous blood.

Viral stocks were diluted into two different dilutions into the corresponding pooled negative clinical matrix and $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of each dilution was transferred onto a dry sterile swab and placed into the KaiBiLi Extended ViralTrans media tubes in triplicate and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and 20-

$2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 0, 24, and 48 hours. At each incubation time point, the sample was vortexed and a $2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ aliquot was removed for the recovery study. The recovery study was conducted using suitable host cells and tissue culture media. For tissue culture, host cells were plated in a microwell plate and allowed to adhere for 48-72 hours prior to recovery testing. Hep-2 cells were used for HSV-1, RSV, and $C .$ . pneumoniae; Vero cells were used for HSV-2; MRC-5 cells were used for Cytomegalovirus and VZV; A549 cells were used for Adenovirus; LLCMK2 cells were used for Parainfluenza 3; MDCK cells were used for Flu A.

Bacterial stocks were diluted into four different dilutions into the corresponding pooled negative clinical matrix and $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of each dilution was transferred onto a dry sterile swab and placed into the KaiBiLi Extended ViralTrans media tubes in duplicate and stored at 2- $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and $2 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 0, 24, and 48 hours. For the swab elution method, at each incubation time point, each sample was vortexed, serially diluted and a $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ aliquot was removed for the recovery study. The recovery study was conducted using Mycoplasma pneumoniae culture medium for $M .$ pneumoniae and Ureaplasma urealyticum culture medium for $U .$ urealyticum. For the roll-plate method, a single dilution was tested in triplicate by streaking the swab from the various KaiBiLi Extended ViralTrans media tube incubation time point over the agar media specified above and incubating for CFU enumeration.

Viral titer for the viruses and foci counts for $C .$ . pneumoniae were evaluated, and CFU was enumerated for $M .$ . pneumoniae and $U .$ urealyticum. The average recovery was calculated as mean viral titer $\mathrm { ( T C I D _ { 5 0 } / m L ) }$ ), mean foci count $\mathrm { ( I F U / m L ) }$ , or mean CFU/mL, respectively, for each storage temperature and time points. The changes (any increase or decrease) in the recovery between time points (each time point compared to time point 0) were presented in percent values or $\log _ { 1 0 }$ change (negative for decrease and positive for increase). Any change that was within one log difference $( + / - 9 0 \% )$ was considered acceptable. Results were combined for all the lots, irrespective of age, as all changes were acceptable. The results are presented in Tables 2 and 3 below.
