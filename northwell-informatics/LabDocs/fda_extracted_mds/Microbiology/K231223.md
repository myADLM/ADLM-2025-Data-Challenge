# Discussion of Tests and Test Results

To substantiate the product performance claims for MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN, Streck collected product performance data for the following studies:

• Multi-Site Precision (Reproducibility),   
• Single-Site Precision (Repeatability),   
• Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility   
• Closed-Vial Stability and Shipping Stability   
• Matrix Effect

# Multi-Site Precision (Reproducibility)

Testing was completed at three (3) sites and consisted of 10 positive control samples and 10 negative control samples for each MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN lot for a total of 30 samples per control type (positive and negative control tubes), 60 samples per lot, tested on different days (2 vials x 1 lot x 1 day, for 10 days and 3 different lots). A total of 180 runs (90 runs per MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN control type; control type $=$ positive or negative control) were generated for data analysis from all testing sites and all MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN lots.

Three lots were used for this study, (#22343, #22353, #22355), at least three Luminex BC-GN panel lots, three locations and at least three operators were included in the study. The data supports that there are no significant differences between different operators and different sites (instruments) on different days when testing different control lots. All samples were prepared and analyzed on the Luminex VERIGENE System Instrument per the control Instructions for Use.

All MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN Positive and Negative Control lots passed with $\geq 9 0 \%$ agreement with expected results. The results support the conclusion that MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN shows reproducibility across three separately manufactured control lots between sites, days, and operators when used with the Luminex BC-GN panels on different Luminex VERIGENE systems.

# Single-Site Precision (Repeatability)

The repeatability of MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN was evaluated using three separately manufactured lots of control. Each lot was tested using the Luminex VERIGENE System. A minimum of three Luminex BC-GN panel lots were used.

Three MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN lots (#22343, #22353, #22355), at least three Luminex BC-GN panel lots and a minimum of two operators were included in the study. Testing consisted of 20 samples per control type (positive and negative control tubes), 40 samples per MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN lot, tested over 20 days. A total of 120 runs (20 runs per MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN control type; control type $=$ positive or negative control) were generated for data analysis for all MDxChexTM for BC-GN lots.

Samples were prepared according to MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN control instructions. Samples were analyzed on the Luminex VERIGENE System per the Instructions for Use. All MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN Positive and Negative Control lots passed with $\geq 9 0 \%$ agreement with expected results. The results support the conclusion that MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN shows repeatability across three separately manufactured control lots when used with the Luminex BC-GN panels.

# Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility

The reproducibility of MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN was evaluated using three separately manufactured lots (#22343, #22353, #22355) manufactured lots of control. Samples were prepared per the control Instructions for Use (IFU) prior to testing with the same Luminex BC-GN panel lot tested on one Luminex VERIGENE System over multiple days.

The within-run precision study was performed to assess performance of one MDx-ChexTM for BCGN lot (#22343), using the same Luminex BC-GN panel lot tested on the same day with one Luminex VERIGENE System.

For the Lot-to-lot study, data from 10 positive and negative control tubes, tested on the same VERIGENE System, were used for data analysis for each control tube per MDx-ChexTM for BCGN lot (30 data points per control type) for a total of 60 data points from three MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN lots.

The within-run precision study consisted of 10 tests for each positive and negative control tube generated from one MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN lot (total of 20 tests per control kit). For this study, Day 60 (2C) closed-vial stability data were used to demonstrate the within-run precision.

All MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN Positive and Negative Control lots passed with $\geq 9 0 \%$ agreement with expected results. The results support that MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN is reproducible across three separately manufactured lots when used with the Luminex VERIGENE BC-GN panel. The results also demonstrate that there are not significant differences in results within run of a control lot.

# Closed-Vial Stability and Shipping Stability

A closed-vial stability study was conducted to assess performance of three MDx-ChexTM for BCGN lots (#22343, #22353, #22355) with the Luminex BC-GN panel using Luminex VERIGENE systems. Testing consisted of 20 positive and 20 negative control samples, per MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN lot, collected at different data collection timepoints and stored at room (25C) and at refrigerated $( 2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ temperatures.

For the shipping stability study, one of the MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN lots (RPL #22355) from each storage temperature $2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ and $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) was subjected to simulated winter and summer shipping temperature profiles over 5 days. Data was collected from 20 samples per control type (i.e., positive and negative), for each simulated shipping profile, within the 61-day CVS testing period.

Samples were prepared and analyzed on the Luminex VERIGENE systems per MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN assay Instructions for Use. All MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN Positive and Negative Control lots passed closed-vial stability, and summer and winter shipping conditions with $\geq 9 0 \%$ agreement with expected results. The data supports that MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN Control kit is stable for a minimum of 60 days for use with the Luminex BC-GN panel lot when stored at 2- $\boldsymbol { 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ .

# Matrix Effect

A matrix effect study was completed to demonstrate that the matrix of the MDx-ChexTM for BCGN has no effect on target detection by the VERIGENE® Gram Negative Blood Culture (BC-GN) panel and produces results consistent with contrived positive blood culture samples.

To verify that the simulated blood culture matrix does not impact performance of the Luminex BCGN panel, one lot (#23026) of Enterobacter cloacae (1.4E8 cells/mL final concentration) was spiked into MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN matrix and also into BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F culture medium supplemented with negative whole blood to simulate a clinical sample (note: spike-in concentration is within the clinical bottle positivity range of approximately 1E7-1E9 CFU/mL).

The simulated samples (i.e., Positive Control) were tested in triplicate using Luminex BC-GN panel. Additionally, non-spiked simulated samples were tested in triplicate using Luminex BC-GN panel serving as negative controls.

The simulated positive MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN matrix and simulated positive clinical sample passed with $\geq 9 0 \%$ agreement for positive detection of analyte. The simulated negative MDxChexTM for BC-GN matrix and simulated negative clinical sample passed with $\geq 9 0 \%$ agreement for negative detection of analyte. The results demonstrate that MDx-ChexTM for BC-GN matrix has no effect on target detection (no inhibition and/or false negative results) when tested with the Luminex BC-GN panel. Data was consistent with the results of simulated blood culture samples.
