# 5.1. Device Description

The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test is an automated in vitro diagnostic test for the simultaneous qualitative detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B, and RSV viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and anterior nasal swab (NS) specimens collected from individuals showing signs and symptoms of respiratory viral infection.

The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test is performed on GeneXpert Instrument Systems (GeneXpert Dx, GeneXpert Infinity-48s and GeneXpert Infinity-80 systems), which consist of an instrument, computer, and preloaded software for running tests and viewing the results. The GeneXpert Instrument Systems automate and integrate sample preparation, nucleic acid extraction and amplification, and detection of the target sequences in simple or complex samples using real-time reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR assays. Depending on the instrument, the GeneXpert Instrument Systems can have from 1 and up to 80 randomly accessible modules, each capable of performing separate sample preparation and real-time RT-PCR and PCR tests. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids (i.e., the syringe drive activates the plunger that works in concert with the rotary valve in the cartridge to move fluids between chambers), an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or spores, and a proprietary $\mathrm { I - C O R E } ^ { \textregistered }$ thermocycler for performing real-time RT-PCR and PCR as well as detection. The systems require the use of single-use disposable cartridges that hold the RT-PCR reagents and host sample purification, nucleic acid amplification, and detection of the target sequences. Because the cartridges are selfcontained, cross-contamination between samples is minimized.

The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test includes reagents for the detection of SARSCoV-2, Flu A, Flu B and RSV viral RNA from NPS and NS specimens. The primers and probes in the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test are designed to amplify and detect unique sequences in the genes that encode the following proteins: SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N), SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E), SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), influenza A matrix (M), influenza A basic polymerase (PB2), influenza A acidic protein (PA), influenza B matrix (M), influenza B non-structural protein (NS), and the RSV A and RSV B nucleocapsid. A Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) are also included in the cartridge utilized by the GeneXpert instrument. The SPC is present to control for adequate processing of the sample and to monitor for the presence of potential inhibitor(s) in the RT-PCR reaction. The SPC also ensures that the RTPCR reaction conditions (temperature and time) are appropriate for the amplification reaction and that the RT-PCR reagents are functional. The PCC verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling, and confirms that all reaction components are present in the cartridge including monitoring for probe integrity and dye stability.

The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test is designed for use with NPS or NS specimens collected with nylon flocked swabs and placed into viral transport medium (VTM), Universal Transport Medium (UTM), or $\mathrm { e N A T } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ . The ancillary specimen collection kits, swabs and transport media validated for use with the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test included:

# • Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection Kit for Viruses

o Copan UTM® 3C057N (Flexible Minitip Flocked Swab with $\mathrm { U T M ^ { \scriptscriptstyle ( \mathrm { ‰} ) } }$ Medium without Beads)   
o Copan eNAT® Molecular Collection and Preservation Medium P/N 6U074S01 (Flexible Minitip Flocked Swab with eNAT® Medium)   
o Becton Dickinson Universal Viral Transport Kit P/N 220531 (Flexible Minitip Flocked Swab with UVT Medium)

# • Nasal Sample Collection Kit for Viruses

o Copan UTM® 3C064N (Regular Flocked Swab with UTM® Medium without Beads) o Copan eNAT® Molecular Collection and Preservation Medium P/N 6U073S01 (Regular Flocked Swab with eNAT® Medium)

• Alternatively, swabs and transport media can be obtained separately:

o Nylon flocked swab (Copan P/N 502CS01, 503CS01) o Viral transport medium, $3 \mathrm { m L }$ (Copan P/N 330C, 3C047N, BD Universal Transport Medium, Remel M4RT or Remel M5)

These ancillary reagents allow NPS and NS specimens from patients to be collected, preserved and transported to laboratory prior to analysis with the Xpert Xpress CoV2/Flu/RSV plus test.

# Analytical Sensitivity – Clinical Nasopharyngeal Swab (NPS) Matrix

The analytical sensitivity of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test was first estimated by using 2 reagent lots and testing limiting dilutions of viruses (NATtrol SARS-CoV-2, 1st World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard for SARS-CoV-2, Flu A H1, Flu A H3 , Flu B Victoria linage, Flu B Yamagata lineage, RSV A and RSV B) in pooled negative clinical NPS-UTM/VTM matrix, following the guidance in Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document EP17-A2. The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration for each strain at which $9 5 \%$ (19/20) of replicates yield a positive result. The estimated LoD values as determined by Probit regression analysis were verified using 2 lots of Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus reagents, by testing 20 replicates per virus/lot combination. The highest (least sensitive) LoD value for the two lots was reported as the final, verified LoD. The verified LoD values for the viruses tested are summarized in Table 5-2.

# Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)

# SARS-CoV-2 in silico Analyses

The inclusivity of Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus was evaluated using in silico analysis of the assay amplicons in relation to SARS-CoV-2 sequences available in the GISAID gene database as of June 15, 2022. The sequences were separated into the lineages of interest based on the Pango Lineage assigned to each genome by GISAID, and those with ambiguous nucleotides were removed. Thus, the following inclusivity analyses focus on the combined, non-ambiguous sequences from the variants of interest and variants of concern as of June 15, 2022. These constituted 10,310,839 sequences for the E target, 10,428,014 sequences for the N2 target, and 10,178,602 sequences for the RdRP target.

a. Single-nucleotide mismatches are predicted to not impact the performance of the test.

Based on the built-in redundancy of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test’s SARSCoV-2 amplification system (i.e., 3 independent targets, only 1 of 3 must be detected to assign a positive result), it is not anticipated that any of the evaluated SARS-CoV-2 sequences would be missed by the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test.

# SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B, and RSV Inclusivity Wet-Testing

In addition to the in silico analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 primers and probes for inclusivity, the inclusivity of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test was evaluated by bench testing against multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A H1N1 (seasonal pre-2009), influenza A H1N1 (pandemic 2009), influenza A H3N2 (seasonal), avian influenza A (H5N1, H5N2, H6N2, H7N2, H7N3, H2N2, H7N9, and H9N2), influenza B (representing strains from both Victoria and Yamagata lineages), and respiratory syncytial virus subgroups A and B (RSV A and RSV B) at concentrations of ${ \sim } 3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD in simulated matrix. A total of 102 respiratory viral strains comprised of 18 SARS-CoV-2 strains, 69 influenza viruses (48 influenza A and 21 influenza B) and 15 RSV strains were evaluated for analytical reactivity (inclusivity) with the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test. Three replicates were tested for each strain. All SARS-CoV-2, Flu and RSV strains tested positive in all 3 replicates. Results are shown in Table 5-5.

# Analytical Specificity (Exclusivity)

# In silico Analyses

An in silico analysis for possible cross-reactions with all the organisms listed in Table 5-6 was conducted by mapping the SARS-CoV-2 oligonucleotides and amplicons in the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test individually to the sequences downloaded from the GISAID database. E gene primers and probes are not specific for SARS-CoV-2 and will detect Human and Bat SARS-coronavirus.

In silico exclusivity analysis using Flu A, Flu B and RSV B primer and probe oligonucleotides against the GenBank database (which encompasses essentially all species) did not identify matches, with at least $80 \%$ similarity to each oligonucleotide, for any nontarget organism expected to be found in a human respiratory tract sample. RSV A primer and probe oligonucleotides exhibited $5 8 0 \%$ homology with two Pangolin RSV A isolates. Therefore, the RSV A primer and probe may cross-react with Pangolin RSV A if the strain is circulating in a human population and present in a sample tested with the Xpert Xpress CoV2/Flu/RSV plus test. While there was some homology $2 8 0 \%$ to human genomic DNA, the matches were to different chromosomal regions, and there were no cases where a forward and reverse primer for a specific target matched to the same human genomic DNA fragment.

In silico exclusivity analysis using the five Flu amplicons (Flu A MP, Flu A PB2, Flu A PA, Flu B MP and Flu B NS) against the GenBank database produced no significant matches to non-influenza-related sequences. Similarly, no matches to RSV isolates from other species or to genomic sequences from non-RSV species were observed with the RSV B amplicon. While no matches of the RSV A amplicon to genomic sequences from non-RSV species of $2 8 0 \%$ homology were observed, the RSV A amplicon shared a $9 5 \%$ identity with two Pangolin RSV A isolates.

No cross reactivity with non-SARS-CoV-2, non-influenza and non-RSV viruses listed in Table 5-6 is expected based on the in silico analysis.

# Wet Testing

In addition to the in silico analysis of the SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and RSV oligonucleotides and amplicons for cross-reactivity, the analytical specificity of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test was evaluated by bench testing a panel of 48 microorganisms, comprising 4 human coronaviruses, 1 MERS coronavirus and 43 common respiratory pathogens or those potentially encountered in the nasopharynx. The panel was tested in different pools of microorganisms in simulated matrix; if a pool produced a positive result, then each member of the pool would have been tested individually. Three replicates of each pool were tested. A sample was considered negative if all three replicates were negative. The bacterial and yeast strains were tested at concentrations $\mathrm { { o f } \geq 1 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { { C F U / m L } } }$ except for Chlamydia pneumoniae which was tested at $1 . 2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ IFU/mL and Lactobacillus reuteri which was tested at $5 \times 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ copies/mL of genomic DNA. Viruses were tested at concentrations o $\mathrm { \Delta \Upsilon \mathrm { f \geq 1 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 } T C I D 5 0 / m L } }$ . The analytical specificity was $100 \%$ . Results are shown in Table 5-7.

# Microbial Interference

Microbial interference of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test caused by the presence of bacterial or viral strains that might be encountered in human upper respiratory tract specimens, was evaluated by testing a panel of 10 potentially interfering microorganisms, consisting of 7 viral strains and 3 bacterial strains. Contrived samples consisted of SARSCoV-2, Flu A, Flu B, RSV A, or RSV B viruses seeded at $3 \mathbf { x }$ the Limit of Detection (LoD) into simulated nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)/nasal swab (NS) matrix in the presence of Adenovirus Type 1C, Human Coronavirus OC43, Rhinovirus Type 1A, Human metapneumovirus, Human parainfluenza Types 1, 2, and 3 (each seeded at $1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ ), Hemophilus influenzae (seeded at $1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ ), Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis (each seeded at $1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 7 } \mathrm { C F U / m L } )$ .

Eight (8) replicates of positive samples were tested for each target virus (SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B, RSV A, or RSV B) and each potential microbial interference strain combination. For each target, all 8 of 8 replicate samples were correctly identified using the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test. No microbial interference by the viral or bacterial strains was reported.

# Competitive Interference

Competitive interference of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus caused by co-infections were evaluated by testing contrived samples of individual SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B or RSV strains at 3x LoD in the presence of different target strains at a higher concentration in a simulated background matrix. The concentration at $3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD was 414 copies/mL for SARS$\mathrm { C o V - } 2$ (inactivated USA-WA1/2020); 0.021 TCID50/mL for Flu A/Idaho/072018, 38.7 $\mathrm { C E I D 5 0 / m L }$ for Flu B/Washington/2/2019; 0.99 TCID50/mL for RSV A/2/Australia/61), and $1 . 1 1 \mathrm { T C I D } 5 0 / \mathrm { m L }$ for RSV B/9320/MA/77. The competitive strains were evaluated at ${ \geq } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ RNA copies $\mathrm { \Delta } ^ { \prime } \mathrm { m L }$ , as determined by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR).

Replicates of 3 were tested for each target strain and each competitive strain combination. The virus at high concentration shows no competitive inhibitory effects if 3 of 3 replicates for the target strain report positive results. If the results reported less than 3 of 3 positive replicates, the concentration of the competing virus was reduced by 10-fold increments until no interference was observed. The results for competitive interference study are presented in Tables 5-8 through 5-12 for high concentration of Flu A, Flu B, RSV A, RSV B and SARSCoV-2, respectively.

The study showed that Flu A/Idaho/07/2018 at concentrations above 1.7e5 RNA copies/mL inhibited detection of Flu B at $3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD, and at concentrations above $1 . 7 \mathrm { e } 6$ RNA copies/mL inhibited detection of RSV A at $3 \mathrm { x \ L o D }$ (Table 5-8). In addition, SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations above 1e5 RNA copies $/ \mathrm { m L }$ inhibited detection of Flu B at $3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD (Table 5- 12). No other competitive interference was observed for the potential co-infections evaluated in the study at the concentrations tested.

# Potentially Interfering Substances

Substances that are normally found in or may be introduced into clinical NPS or NS matrix that could potentially interfere with accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B and RSV were evaluated with direct testing on the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus.

Potentially interfering substances in the nasal passage and nasopharynx may include, but are not limited to: blood, nasal secretions or mucus, and nasal and throat medications used to relieve congestion, nasal dryness, irritation, or asthma and allergy symptoms, as well as antibiotics and antivirals. Positive and negative samples were prepared in simulated nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)/ nasal swab (NS) matrix. Negative samples $( \mathrm { N } = 8 )$ were tested in the presence of each substance to determine the effect on the performance of the sample processing control (SPC). Positive samples $( \Nu = 8 )$ ) were tested per substance with viruses spiked at 3x the LoD determined for each strain. Positive samples tested with the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus included one SARS-CoV-2, two influenza A H1N1, two influenza A H3N2, two influenza B and two RSV (RSV A and RSV B) strains. The substances, with active ingredients and test concentrations, that were evaluated are listed in Table 5-13.

# Carryover Contamination

A study was conducted to assess whether the single-use, self-contained Xpert Xpress CoV2/Flu/RSV plus cartridge prevents specimen and amplicon carryover by testing a negative sample immediately after testing of a very high positive sample in the same GeneXpert module. The negative sample used in this study consisted of simulated NPS/NS matrix and the positive sample consisted of high Flu B and high SARS-CoV-2 virus concentrations (Flu B/Wisconsin/10/2016 at $1 . 0 { \mathrm { e 6 } } \ \mathrm { T C I D 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L }$ and inactivated SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 at 1e4 copies/mL) seeded into simulated NPS/NS matrix. The negative sample was tested in a GeneXpert module at the start of the study. Following the initial testing of the negative sample, the high positive sample was processed in the same GeneXpert module immediately followed by another negative sample. This was repeated 20 times in the same module, resulting in 20 positives and 21 negatives for the module. The study was repeated using a second GeneXpert module for a total of 40 positive and 42 negative samples. All 40 positive samples were correctly reported as SARS-CoV-2 POSITIVE; Flu A NEGATIVE; Flu B POSITIVE; RSV NEGATIVE. All 42 negative samples were correctly reported as SARSCoV-2 NEGATIVE; Flu A NEGATIVE; Flu B NEGATIVE; RSV NEGATIVE with the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test. No specimen or amplicon carry-over contamination was observed in this study.

# Single-Site Precision

The precision of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test was established at a single site using a 9-member panel including one negative sample, 4 low positive $\left( \sim 1 . 5 \mathrm { x } \ L \mathrm { o D } \right)$ samples and 4 moderate positive ( $- 3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD) samples. The negative sample consisted of simulated matrix without target microorganism or target RNA. The positive samples were contrived using inactivated NATtrol SARS-CoV-2 (ZeptoMetrix, Buffalo, NY, catalog number NATSARS(COV2)-ST), and cultured viruses Influenza A/Idaho/07/2018, Influenza B/Wisconsin/10/2016, and RSV B/Wash/18537/62 in a simulated NPS/NS matrix.

Testing was conducted over 20 days, using 1 lot of Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus cartridges at a single site and with 1 operator to yield a total of 80 observations per panel member (1 Site x 1 Operator x 1 Lot x 20 Days x 2 Runs x 2 Replicates $= 8 0$ observations/panel member).

# Reproducibility

The reproducibility of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test was established at 3 sites (2 external and 1 internal) using a 9-member panel including 1 negative sample, 4 low positive $\left( \sim 1 . 5 \mathrm { x } \ L \mathrm { o D } \right)$ and 4 moderate positive $\left( \sim 3 \mathbf { x } \ L \mathbf { o } \mathbf { D } \right)$ samples. The negative sample consisted of simulated matrix without target microorganism or target RNA. The positive samples were contrived using inactivated NATtrol SARS-CoV-2 (ZeptoMetrix), cultured viruses Influenza A/ Idaho/07/2018, Influenza B/Wisconsin/ 10/2016, and RSV $\mathrm { B } / \mathrm { W a s h } / 1 8 5 3 7 / 6 2$ in a simulated NPS/NS matrix. Testing was conducted over 6 days, using 3 lots of Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus cartridges at 3 participating sites each with 2 operators to yield a total of 144 observations per panel member (3 Sites x 2 Operators x 3 Lots x 2 Days/Lot x 2 Runs x 2 Replicates $= 1 4 4$ observations/panel member). The results from the study are summarized in Tables 5-16 and 5-17.

The percent agreement of the correct results compared to the expected results analyzed by each of the 6 operators and each site is shown in Table 5-17. In addition, the overall percent agreement for each sample $\%$ total agreement) and the two-sided Wilson Score confidence intervals (CI) are presented in the last column.

a. One replicate was excluded because it was run on a day when an external positive control produced an incorrect result but was inadvertently not retested.

The evaluation of reproducibility and within-laboratory precision of the underlying analyte $\mathrm { C t }$ values for the Xpert Xpress CoV$2 / \mathrm { F l u / R S V }$ plus test was analyzed using nested Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The mean $\mathrm { C t }$ , standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation $( \% C V )$ between-sites, between-operators, between-lots, between-days, between-runs and within-run for each panel member are presented in Table 5-17.

a. One replicate from Site 2 used the reagent lot 102 instead of the intended reagent lot 401. In the nested ANOVA analysis, this replicate was calculated under the intended lot 401 following the principle of “analyze as intended”. b. Nine replicates were excluded due to zero Flu A2 Ct values. c. One replicate was excluded due to the zero Flu B Ct value; one replicate was excluded due to the incorrect external positive control result preceding the retest.

# 5.4.2. Clinical Performance

The clinical performance of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test was evaluated in a multi-site, observational and method comparison study that included 33 geographically diverse sites in the United States (US) using specimens collected from individuals showing signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. Of the 33 sites, 5 sites participated in specimen collection only, 27 performed Xpert testing and specimen collection, and 1 site performed Xpert testing as well as comparator and discrepant testing.

Specimens tested included prospective clinical NPS and NS specimens collected in UTM/VTM. Prospectively collected fresh clinical specimens (Category I) tested in the study were from a larger US specimen collection protocol. Fresh $( 9 8 . 9 \% )$ and frozen $( 1 . 1 \% )$ specimens meeting the eligibility criteria were prospectively collected and tested in 2022. Due to low prevalence of Flu/RSV in 2022, archived prospectively collected frozen clinical specimens (Category II) collected during the 2016-2017 influenza season were used to supplement the sample size. These specimens represent contemporary Flu/RSV strains. Since these specimens were collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, they were expected to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 and therefore tested only for the Flu A, Flu B, and RSV targets. Available demographic data from the individuals from whom Category I and Category II specimens were collected are presented in Table 5-18.

Specimens were tested using Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus side-by-side with a U.S.FDA-cleared molecular respiratory panel that includes SARS-CoV-2 and a U.S. FDAcleared molecular Flu A/B/RSV assay, in a randomized and blinded fashion.

Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) and Negative Percent Agreement (NPA), and nondeterminate rate were determined by comparing the results of the Xpert Xpress CoV2/Flu/RSV plus test relative to the results of a U.S. FDA-cleared molecular respiratory panel for the SARS-CoV-2 target, and a U.S.FDA-cleared molecular Flu A/B/RSV assay for the Flu A, Flu B, and RSV targets, respectively.

Discrepant results between Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus and the comparator for the SARS-CoV-2 target were investigated using a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2 molecular test. Discrepant results between the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus and the comparator for the Flu A/B/RSV targets were investigated using a U.S. FDA-cleared molecular respiratory panel.

A total of 5051 specimens, including 2536 NPS and 2515 NS specimens that yielded valid results by both the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus and the U.S. FDA-cleared molecular respiratory panel were included in the performance evaluation for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 5954 specimens, including 3011 NPS and 2943 NS (specimens that yielded valid results by both the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus and the U.S. FDA-cleared molecular Flu A/B/RSV assay were included in the performance evaluation for Flu A, Flu B, and RSV targets.

For the NPS specimens (both fresh and frozen specimens, combined), Xpert Xpress CoV2/Flu/RSV plus demonstrated a PPA and NPA of $9 7 . 1 \%$ and $9 8 . 2 \%$ for SARS-CoV-2, respectively; $9 9 . 0 \%$ and $9 9 . 1 \%$ for Flu A, respectively; $9 6 . 6 \%$ and $1 0 0 . 0 \%$ for Flu B, respectively; $9 8 . 6 \%$ and $1 0 0 . 0 \%$ for RSV, respectively (Table 5-19). The initial nondeterminate rate for the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test was $2 . 4 \%$ (74/3094). On repeat testing, 66 specimens yielded valid results. The final non-determinate rate for the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test was $0 . 3 \%$ (8/3094).
