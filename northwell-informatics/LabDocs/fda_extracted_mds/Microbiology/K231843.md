# ARX-VTM composi�on:

The ARX-VTM contains an�microbial agents to inhibit overgrowth of bacteria, fungi, and yeasts; Hank’s Balanced Salt Solu�on (HBSS) enriched with proteins and sugars for stabiliza�on; and a buffer system to maintain neutral pH. All raw materials used in the manufacture of ARX Viral Transport Media System are qualified before use. Every batch of ARX Viral Transport Media is tested prior to release for pH, osmolarity, turbidity and absence of bacteria growth.

# Indica�ons of Use

The ARX Viral Transport Media Collec�on & Transport System (ARX-VTM) is intended for the collec�on and transport of clinical specimens containing viruses from the collec�on site to the tes�ng laboratory. The ARX-VTM is a culture-based media that is intended to be used in the laboratory to perform viral culture or diagnos�c assays for viruses including, Influenza A, Parainfluenza type 3, Coronavirus OC43, Respiratory Syncy�al Virus (RSV) A, Herpes Simplex virus 1& 2, Echovirus, and Cytomegalovirus.

# Steriliza�on

The ARX-VTM kit is not claimed to be sterile nor is it intended to be sterilized by the end user. To decrease the chance of contamina�on the media uses specific manufacturing steps including steriliza�on of the PP tubes. The media is filtered using a $0 . 2 2 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ sterile fiber membrane and then is asep�cally filled into the pre-sterilized tubes. ARX-VTM was then validated by a quality control process which evaluates the absence of growth of bacteria and fungi by spreading a 0.1mL of the filtered media on nutrient agar media plates and incubated at $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for 24-48 hours. No growth on any of the plates tested was observed.

# Performance Characteris�cs

The performance characteris�cs of ARX Viral Transport Media System were determined using culture-based recovery studies for the following viruses: Coronavirus, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Echovirus Type 30, Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1), Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2), Influenza A, Parainfluenza 3, and Respiratory Syncy�al Virus (RSV). Dilu�ons of the virus stock suspensions were prepared in clinical matrix and $1 0 0 \mu \iota$ was inoculated onto swabs in triplicate. The swabs were transferred into the transport medium and held at both ${ 2 } { \cdot } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ and room temperature $( 2 5 - 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ . The dilu�on used for each target was predetermined by demonstra�ng $\sim 4 0$ to $50 \%$ infec�on via FFU a�er 24-48 hours in culture.

At �me points following inocula�on into VTM (0, 24, 48, and 72), each sample was mixed thoroughly, and an aliquot of the suspension was inoculated into monolayer cells cultured with media in 96-well plates. A�er 24-48 hours of inocula�on, the cells were washed, fixed, and immunostained by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled an�bodies for each target virus. The virus �ter was determined by visual enumera�on of fluorescent foci units (FFU) of each target virus. Table 2 below exhibits the viral recovery performance of the ARX-VTM at ${ 2 - 8 ^ { \circ } C }$ . Table 3 below exhibits the viral recovery performance of the ARX-VTM at $2 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } C .$ . Any change of virus �ter that was within one log $( + / - 9 0 \% )$ from the baseline (�me point 0) was considered acceptable.

\* Considered acceptable because subsequent �mepoints, i.e., 48 h and 72 h �me points showed $< 9 0 \%$ increase.

# Shelf Life:

To evaluate Shelf-life, three lots of ARX-VTM samples were tested and visually examined for real-�me aging to 20 months. The lots of media were stored at ${ 2 } { \cdot } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ or room temperature (25- $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ . Duplicate samples from each lot were visually inspected for turbidity (the appearance of the product is expected to be clear (i.e., no turbidity, not cloudy, and no precipita�on) and maintains a pink color (i.e., no color change from pink to yellow). The media lots were tested for pH (acceptable range: $7 . 4 \pm 0 . 4$ ) and osmolarity (acceptable range: $2 9 0 \pm 3 0 \mathsf { m O s m / K g } )$ . All results were acceptable and support the claim that the ARX-VTM is stable for up to 20 months.

# Substan�al Equivalence
