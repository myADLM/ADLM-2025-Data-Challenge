# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The candidate device, Copan UTM-RT, is provided in a screw capped, conical bottom, polypropylene tube filled with $3 \mathrm { m L }$ of UTM-RT transport medium. Copan UTM-RT is supplied in either of two (2) configurations, namely, medium tube alone in a paper-film peel pouch (bulk configuration), or medium tube accompanied by sterile flocked swab in a peel pouch for specimen collection (kit configuration). In the kit configuration, the flocked swab is available in three (3) shapes—i.e., regular, minitip, and minitip flexible —that are suitable for specimen collection from various sites on patient, including the upper respiratory cavity. Further, the medium tube for both the swab configurations above can be provided with or without glass beads inside. The medium tube with beads will be distinguished from tube without beads by the wording “with beads” written in the product description on tube and external labels, as well as in other labeling materials.

The screw cap of the UTM-RT medium tube has a unique internal molded design that is able to capture a swab shaft when the shaft is broken off into the tube and cap is closed. The flocked specimen collection swab (provided sterile in a paper-peel pouch with UTM-RT medium in the kit configuration) has a tip flocked with nylon fiber and a solid plastic shaft with a molded breaking point. The nylon flocked swab along with its plastic shaft is the only component that may come in transient (typically $< 1$ minute) contact with patient tissue (e.g., mucosal surfaces) during use in specimen collection. After the specimen is collected, the swab shaft is broken off at the breaking point such that the swab with the collected specimen remains within the medium tube.

# B Principle of Operation:

The UTM-RT medium is designed to maintain the integrity and viability of viruses, chlamydiae, mycoplasma, or ureaplasma and the integrity of nucleic acids for upper respiratory viruses.

Composition of the UTM-RT medium: Modified Hank’s Balanced Salts Bovine Serum Albumin L-Cysteine Hydrochloride Sodium Bicarbonate Gelatin Sucrose L-Glutamic Acid

HEPES Buffer 1M Vancomycin Amphotericin B Colistin Phenol Red Distilled Water

Specimens preserved in UTM-RT transport media are suitable for testing with subsequent culture procedure (all clinical specimens) or molecular amplification (limited to upper respiratory clinical specimens suspected of containing nucleic acids from respiratory viruses).

# VI Standards/Guidance Documents Referenced:

Not applicable to the current studies.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility; Linearity; Analytical Specificity/Interference; Assay Reportable Range; Traceability; Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods); Assay Cut-off: Not Applicable

2. Stability/Shelf life:

The previously cleared device (K042970) has a shelf-life of 18-months. For the candidate device, no changes were made to the manufacturing of the UTM-RT transport medium or kit components, and no extension of the shelf-life was claimed. The existing shelf-life stability validation data from the original clearance remains appropriate to support an 18-month shelf life claim for the candidate device.

# Performance Testing – Culture Recovery Studies:

Performance of the Copan Universal Transport Medium (UTM-RT) System was evaluated by culture-based recovery studies for viral and bacterial test strains under and the results were deemed acceptable during the clearance of the original device, K042970. Since the medium tube (container), UTM-RT media composition, and other kit components remain unchanged, and no extension of the specimen stability is being claimed, a new set of performance evaluation for specimen stability via culture recovery is not required for the current candidate device (K232357).

# Performance Testing – Nucleic Acid Stability Studies:

To support the new intended use claim, “UTM-RT is intended for the stabilization and transportation of an unprocessed upper respiratory clinical specimen suspected of containing respiratory viruses’ nucleic acids. UTM-RT is intended for use with compatible molecular assays”, the sponsor conducted fresh studies to determine the LoD of molecular detection of three (3) representative target viral nucleic acids—namely, Influenza A, Influenza B, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)—followed by specimen stability studies in the candidate transport medium system. These stability studies, performed both in cold $( 2 \mathrm { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and at room temperature $( 2 2 \mathrm { - } 2 8 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { C } )$ , utilized variously aged lots (as available) of UTM-RT provided in medium tubes with and without glass beads as shown below in Table 1.

Further, the LoD and stability studies with the candidate device were performed in an artificial nasopharyngeal/nasal (referred to as “NPS/NS”) fluid matrix. This simulated matrix was previously qualified as an appropriate matrix when used with Copan UTM/VTM since this was shown to be equivalent to clinical nasopharyngeal and anterior nasal matrices in Sample Matrix and Transport Media Equivalency studies performed to support clearance of the Cepheid Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus Assay (K231481). Therefore, the use of the same simulated matrix to support this transport medium candidate device was deemed appropriate, and the studies were designed and conducted accordingly.

As shown in the following summary Tables 2–4, the freshly performed stability tests with representative viral targets (as indicated above) demonstrated specimen stability for up to 96 hours during storage and/or transport at a temperature range of $2 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in UTM-RT tubes with or without glass beads. Samples were tested using a compatible, representative, FDA-cleared molecular assay (i.e., Cepheid Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus Assay in combination with GeneXpert Dx) following the molecular assay’s package insert. The cycle threshold (Ct) values were used to assess performance and calculate the difference in Ct values $\mathrm { ( \Delta \Delta C t ) }$ at tested time points relative to baseline (Time 0). Results were considered acceptable if a $\Delta \mathrm { C t } < 3$ was observed. Additionally, these studies established acceptable performance of the candidate device for UTM-RT medium aged up to 18 months by incorporating lots of different ages at the time of testing.

Note: The average $C t$ value is calculated for each time point $X$ hrs. (Time $\chi \smash { \mathstrut }$ starting with time $\boldsymbol { \theta }$ $( T _ { 0 } )$ and the difference (ΔCt) at each Time $X$ is then estimated relative to the average $C t$ at $T _ { 0 } ,$ i.e., (Time $X - T _ { 0 } )$ , as indicated by the Asterisk $( ^ { * } )$ .

Of note, the performance parameters established in these studies pertain exclusively to the newly introduced claim of stability of respiratory viral nucleic acids in the candidate medium for subsequent testing in a compatible molecular assay. Especially, frozen storage of specimens in UTM-RT at or below $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for testing with a molecular assay has not been validated and is not recommended. However, it is acceptable to store specimens in UTM-RT at or below $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for subsequent processing using virus, chlamydiae, mycoplasma, and ureaplasma culture, as was previously cleared (K042970). This distinction is noted in device labeling.
