Enclosure

Device Name BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ CLIA-Waived Kit

Indications for Use (Describe)

The BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ CLIA-Waived Kit is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the direct and qualitative detection of influenza A and B viral nucleoprotein antigens from nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs of symptomatic patients. The BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ CLIA-Waived Kit (also referred to as the BD Veritor System and BD Veritor System Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ ) is a differentiated test, such that influenza A viral antigens can be distinguished from influenza B viral antigens from a single processed sample using a single device. The test is to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza A and B viral infections. A negative test is presumptive, and it is recommended that these results be confirmed by viral culture or an FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay. Negative test results do not preclude influenza viral infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. The test is not intended to detect influenza C antigens.

Performance characteristics for influenza A and B were established during January through March of 2011 when influenza viruses A/2009 H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria lineage, and B/Yamagata lineage were the predominant influenza viruses in circulation according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the CDC entitled “Update: Influenza Activity—United States, 2010–2011 Season, and Composition of the 2011–2012 Influenza Vaccine.” Performance characteristics may vary against other emerging influenza viruses.

If infection with a novel influenza virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to the state or local health department for testing. Virus culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION

# A. Summary

The BD VeritorTM System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ CLIA Waived Kit is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the direct and qualitative detection of influenza A and B viral antigens from nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs of symptomatic patients. The test is to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza A and B viral infections. It is a differentiated test, such that influenza A viral antigens can be distinguished from influenza B viral antigens from a single processed sample using a single test device. Negative test results do not preclude influenza viral infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other management decisions. All negative test results should be confirmed by another methodology, such as a nucleic acid-based method.

BD VeritorTM System Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ test devices are interpreted by a BD VeritorTM Plus Analyzer. When using the BD VeritorTM Plus Analyzer, workflow steps depend on the selected operational mode and the Analyzer configuration settings. In Analyze Now mode, the instrument evaluates assay devices after manual timing of their development. In Walk Away mode, devices are inserted immediately after application of the specimen, and timing of assay development and analysis is automated.

# B. Test Principle

There are no changes to the test principle since the assay was cleared under K223016. The modifications described in this submission do not change the test principle. The following is the principle of the test as stated in K223016.

The BD VeritorTM System Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ CLIA-Waived Kit is an immuno-chromatographic assay for detection of influenza A and B viral antigens in samples processed from respiratory specimens. The viral antigens detected by the BD Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ test are nucleoprotein, not hemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA) proteins. Flu viruses are prone to minor point mutations (i.e., antigenic drift) in either one or both of the surface proteins (i.e., HA or NA). The BD Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ test is not affected by antigenic drift or shift because it detects the highly conserved nucleoprotein of the influenza viruses. To perform the test, the patient specimen swab is treated in a supplied reaction tube prefilled with a lysing agent that serves to expose the target viral antigens, and then expressed through a filter tip into the sample well on a BD VeritorTM Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ test device. Any influenza A or influenza B viral antigens present in the specimen bind to anti-influenza antibodies conjugated to colloidal gold micro-particles on the BD VeritorTM Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ test strip. The antigen-conjugate complex then migrates across the test strip to the capture zone and reacts with either Anti-Flu A or Anti-Flu B antibodies that are immobilized on the two test lines on the membrane.

The BD Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ test device shown in Figure 1 is designed with five spatially distinct zones including positive and negative control line positions, separate test line positions for the target analytes, and a background zone. The test lines for the target analytes are labeled on the test device as ‘A’ for flu A position, and ‘B’ for flu B position. The onboard positive control ensures the sample has flowed correctly and is indicated on the test device as $^ { \mathfrak { s } } \mathrm { C } ^ { \mathfrak { s } } .$ Two of the five distinct zones on the test device are not labeled. These two zones are an onboard negative control line and an assay background zone. The active negative control feature in each test identifies and compensates for specimen-related, nonspecific signal generation. The remaining zone is used to measure the assay background.

# D. Instrumentation

The BD VeritorTM System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ CLIA-Waived Kit is intended for use with the BD VeritorTM Plus Analyzer.

The Analyzer is a digital immunoassay instrument that uses a reflectance-based measurement method and applies assay specific algorithms to determine the presence or absence of the target analyte. The Analyzer supports the use of different assays by reading an assay-specific barcode on the test device. Depending on the configuration chosen by the operator, the instrument communicates status and results to the operator via a liquid crystal display (LCD) on the instrument, a connected printer, or through a secure connection to the facility’s information system.

In the case of the Flu $\mathbf { A } + \mathbf { B }$ test, the BD VeritorTM Plus Analyzer subtracts nonspecific signal at the negative control line from the signal present at both the Flu A and Flu B test lines. If the resultant line signal is above a pre-selected assay cutoff, the specimen scores as positive. If the resultant line signal is below the cutoff, the specimen scores as negative. Use of the active negative control feature allows the BD VeritorTM Plus Analyzer to correctly interpret test results that cannot be scored visually because the human eye is unable to accurately perform the subtraction of the nonspecific signal. The measurement of the assay background zone is an important factor during test interpretation as the reflectance is compared to that of the control and test zones. A background area that is white to light pink indicates the device has performed correctly.

The instrument does not require calibration. A BD VeritorTM Plus Analyzer can be identified by the image in Figure 2.

Figure 2. BD VeritorTM Plus Analyzer

The BD VeritorTM Plus Analyzer has the flexibility of an optional bar code scanning module and cellular connectivity designed to facilitate record keeping as well as the addition of a “Walk Away” workflow mode. Depending on the configuration chosen by the operator, the BD VeritorTM Plus Analyzer communicates status and results to the operator via a liquid crystal display (LCD) on the instrument, a connected printer, or through a secure connection to the facility’s information system.

# DESCRIPTION OF THE CHANGES

This traditional 510(k) is submitted for modifications to the BD VeritorTM Plus Analyzer previously cleared with the BD VeritorTM System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ CLIA-Waived Kit (K223016).

The Analyzer was modified to add a plastic shield to the Analyzer’s enclosure and in front of the liquid crystal display (LCD) screen to protect the screen from being damaged when a high electrostatic discharge (ESD) voltage is applied. The main printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) was modified to add enhanced ESD and battery protection. The modified Analyzer was tested and demonstrated compliance with the following standards:

<table><tr><td>Equipment</td><td>Safety Requirements for Electrical IEC 61010-1:2010, IEC 61010-1:2010/AMD 1:2016 IEC 61010-2-101:2018 for use in conjunction with IEC 61010-1:2010, AMD 1:2016</td></tr><tr><td>Electromagnetic compatibility and electrical safety</td><td>EN IEC 61326-1:2020 EN IEC 61326-2-6:2021 EN 60601-1-2:2015 + A1: 2021 (the equivalence of ANSI AAMI IEC 60601-1-2:2014 [Including AMD 1:2021])</td></tr></table>

A new firmware (v6.00) was developed to support the Analyzer’s new hardware features including switch monitoring, power path monitoring and control. The Instructions for Use for the BD Veritor™ Plus Analyzer will be updated to reflect conformance to the electromagnetic compatibility and electrical safety standards.

There are no changes to the subject device’s intended use, kit components, or technological characteristics.

# SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE

In accordance with FDA’s Guidance, The 510(k) Program: Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications (July 28, 2014), the modified device is substantially equivalent to the legally marketed device as described in K223016. The rationale for determination of substantial equivalence is based on the Guidance’s’ 510(k) Decision-Making Flowchart and described below.

The predicate device, BD VeritorTM System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ CLIAWaived Kit, is a legally marketed device by BD.   
The modified device has the same intended use as the predicate device.   
The modified device has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device. The changes made to the Analyzer do not change the technological characteristics of the predicate device. There are no changes to the kit components of the device or to the workflow of performing the assay.   
The changes do not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness. Testing was performed and demonstrated compliance to:

<table><tr><td>Safety Requirements for Electrical Equipment</td><td>IEC 61010-1:2010, IEC 61010-1:2010/AMD 1:2016 IEC 61010-2-101:2018 for use in conjunction with IEC 61010-1:2010, AMD 1:2016</td></tr><tr><td>Electromagnetic compatibility and electrical safety</td><td>EN IEC 61326-1:2020 EN IEC 61326-2-6:2021 EN 60601-1-2:2015 + A1: 2021 (the equivalence of ANSI AAMI IEC 60601-1-2:2014 [Including AMD 1:2021])</td></tr></table>

Instrument EMI/ESD: No EMI nor ESD susceptibility was observed during compliance testing. Non-clinical testing results verified that the Analyzer device functionalities remain the same and operations and performance of the Analyzer were not impacted.

Analytical Performance: There have been no changes to the analytical performance of the BD VeritorTM System for Rapid Detection of Flu $\mathbf { A } { + } \mathbf { B }$ CLIA-Waived Kit since the assay was last cleared in K180438. The modifications to the Analyzer do not have an impact on the assay-specific analytical performance.

Clinical Performance: Clinical performance testing was not required because the changes made to the Analyzer do not have an impact on the assay-specific clinical performance.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the claim of substantial equivalence is based on the determination that the modifications to the Analyzer do not result in a new intended use or technological performance of the assay. The device is safe and as effective as the legally marketed device (K223016) and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness.
