Rx - For Prescription Use Only

The Viral Transport Media is intended to be used with Rayon Tip Swab listed on FDA by the manufacturer HENSO MEDICAL (HANGZHOU) CO., LTD. The use of medium, tubes, or swabs from any other source may compromise performance.

Condition, timing, and volume of specimen collected for culture are significant variables in obtaining reliable culture results.

The Viral Transport Medium is not intended for freezing and thawing.

The medium has been evaluated for its ability to transport various respiratory viruses, which include, Influenza A, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and Rhinovirus, for viral recovery. Results obtained largely depend on proper and adequate specimen collection as well as the promptness with which the specimens are transported to the laboratory and analyzed.

D Special Instrument Requirements:

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The Viral Transport Medium (VTM) is a non-propagating transport device composed of a culture-based media without swabs. The VTM is designed to preserves upper respiratory samples collected from a patient by placing the sample into the polymer tube containing $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of media. The sample and media are then secured with a leak-proof screwcap for transportation.

The VTM maintains cellular integrity and preservation of viruses when properly stored. Prior to use, vials should be stored at $2 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . After specimen collection, the transport tube containing the specimen can be stored for up to 48 hours at either $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , for transportation to the laboratory and storage. The medium has been evaluated for storage of the following respiratory viruses, Influenza A, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and Rhinovirus, for viral recovery.

# VI Standards/Guidance Documents Referenced:

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

A Analytical Performance: 1. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable.

2. Linearity: Not applicable.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference: Not applicable.

4. Assay Reportable Range: Not applicable.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

A. Shelf-Life:

The shelf-life for the ALB LUZ Viral Transport Media was established to be 18 months from the date of manufacture when stored in a clean, dry, ventilated environment at $2 - 3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The shelf-life study was conducted by using real-time aging performance test for 18 months. In this study, the shelf life was evaluated for physical stability of appearance and volume, and pH stability during the period of storage.

i. Physical Stability: To evaluate physical stability, any changes in appearance in color, turbidity and volume of the ALB LUZ Viral Transport Media were physically or visually examined at storage time points $\mathrm { T } = 0$ , 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months. Three lots were tested for physical stability at storage conditions of $2 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . At each time point, appearance of the product was inspected visually which appeared clear with slight precipitation and maintained an orange-pink color (i.e., no changes in color) and no changes in liquid media volume. All results were acceptable and support the claim that the ALB LUZ Viral Transport Media is physically or visually stable for 18 months.

ii. pH Stability: To evaluate product stability, the $\mathsf { p H }$ of the ALB LUZ Viral Transport Media was tested at storage time points $\mathrm { T } = 0$ , 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months. Three lots were tested for $\mathsf { p H }$ stability at storage condition of $2 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ and $3 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ . At each time point, the pH was measured by immersing the $\mathsf { p H }$ meter electrode into each ALB LUZ Viral Transport Media by adjusting the temperature to $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . For all the tubes tested, the pH measurement was within the acceptable $\mathsf { p H }$ range of 7.2 to 7.6. All results were acceptable and support the claim for $\mathsf { p H }$ stability of the ALB LUZ Viral Transport Media for 18 months.

The results for physical stability and $\mathsf { p H }$ stability collectively support the 18-month stability claim for the ALB LUZ Viral Transport Media.

# B. Sterilization:

The ALB LUZ Viral Transport Media is not claimed to be sterile nor is it intended to be sterilized by the end user. To reduce the contamination, the transport media is filtered using a $0 . 2 2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ sterile filter membrane and then $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ aliquot is aseptically transferred into individual sterile conical screw-capped tubes. A microbial contamination check was conducted by incubating the tubes for 48 hours at $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ followed by transferring 100 $\mu \mathrm { L }$ of transport media into BHI media and incubating for 24 hours at $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . No growth was observed on any of the tested media.

6. Detection Limit:

# Performance Testing – Viral Recovery Studies:

Performance of ALB LUZ Viral Transport Media was evaluated by Culture-Based Recovery Studies for viral test strains using plaque forming assay. The viral strains and cell lines used for the plaque forming assay are shown in the Table 1.

Table 1. Viral strains and Cell Lines used for the plaque forming assay.

To perform the recovery assay, virus stock was 10-fold serially diluted into pooled negative clinical nasal matrix. Each sample dilution was transferred into ALB LUZ Viral Transport Media by using Rayon Tip Swab and stored at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and $2 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 0, 24 and 48 hours respectively. Three lots of VTM with newly manufactured, mid-range lot and close to expiry lots were used to evaluate viral recovery. For tissue culture, MDCK (ATCC CCL-34) and MRC-5 (Instituto Adolfo Lutz CCIAL 023) were seeded in 24-well plates and grown to a confluent monolayer. To perform the plaque forming assay, the viral samples from ALB LUZ Viral Transport Media were serially diluted 10-fold and added to the monolayer in triplicate and allowed for virus adsorption by incubating the plates for 1 hour at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Semisolid medium containing DMEM, $1 \%$ carboxymethyl cellulose, and $1 \%$ penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics were added to each well and incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 5-7 days. For counting the plaques developed, the cell fixation was performed with $10 \%$ paraformaldehyde and the staining of cell monolayer was performed with $1 \%$ crystal violet. Plaque-forming units were counted visually. The viral titer of each sample was recorded and calculated in plaque-forming units per mL (PFU/mL) and the results from the triplicates were provided as an average PFU/mL for 0, 24 and 48 hours. Results were considered acceptable if the average viral recovery demonstrates any percent changes within $\pm 9 0 \%$ (i.e.,1 log change).

The results are presented in the Table 2 and Table 3 below. Any reduction in the viral count in the timepoints was shown as percent changes and -ve indicates reduction.
