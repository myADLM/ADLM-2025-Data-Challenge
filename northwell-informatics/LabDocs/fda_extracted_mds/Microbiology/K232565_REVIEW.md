# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

Copan’s UriSponge - Urine Collection, Transport, and Preservation System consists of screw cap self-standing plastic tube with conical shaped bottom. Inside the tube, the cap holds a plastic stick with sponges made of hydrophilic polyurethane. The sponges include preservative substances (Sodium Propionate, and Potassium Sorbate). Two sizes of product are available: the regular tube size ( $1 0 0 \mathrm { m m }$ length $\textbf { x } 1 6 \mathrm { m m }$ diameter) plastic tube, and the mini tube size ( $\mathrm { 8 0 } \mathrm { m m }$ length $\mathbf { x } \ 1 2 \ \mathrm { m m }$ diameter) plastic tube.

# B Principle of Operation:

The UriSponge applicator stick has two (mini size) or three (regular size) cylindrical shaped sponges which are contained within appropriately sized sterile plastic tube with screw cap. The sponges contain the chemical preservatives (Sodium Propionate, and Potassium Sorbate). These chemical preservatives maintain the microbial load of bacteria and yeast in absorbed urine sample during the transport until they are received and tested in the laboratory by standard culture techniques.

1. ISO 11137-1:2006 (including Amendment 1:2013 and Amendment 2:2018), Sterilization of Health Care Products- Radiation-Part1: Requirements for development, validation, and routine control of a sterilization process for medical devices.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable   
2. Linearity: Not applicable

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference: Not applicable

4. Assay Reportable Range: Not applicable

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

Shelf Life: A real-time shelf-life stability testing was conducted. Testing was conducted with 3 different lots of the mini version of the devices ( $\mathrm { 8 0 } \mathrm { m m }$ length $\mathbf { x } \ 1 2 \ \mathrm { m m }$ diameter) at each timepoint (at within 1 month after manufacture, at approximately 5-6 months after manufacture, at approximately 12 months after manufacture and at 13 months after manufacture). Physical, mechanical stability as well as sponge absorption and release volumes were evaluated using 30 devices from each lot. To determine the physical and the mechanical stability, each lot was inspected for device’s appearance and integrity through the intended use workflow. Sponge absorption and release volume were also tested to determine physical stability. Preservative content of UriSponge was tested at each timepoint by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. All results met the study acceptance criteria to support a shelf-life stability of 12 months when stored at $2 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in appropriate storage environment.

Sterilization: UriSponge tubes are sterilized using irradiation, with the dosage set following ISO 11137-1:2006 (including Amendment 1:2013 and Amendment 2:2019), Sterilization of Health Care Products- Radiation-Part1: Requirements for development, validation, and routine control of a sterilization process for medical devices. The acceptable sterility assurance level (SAL) for the sterilized UriSponge product was determined to be $1 0 ^ { - 6 }$ or greater.

Performance Testing - Recovery Studies:

A culture-based recovery study was performed to support that ability of the UriSponge device to keep microbial load stable in the collected urine up to 48 hours at both $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $1 9 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Recovery of Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Streptococcus agalactiae (ATCC 13813), Enterococcus Faecalis (ATCC 29212), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Proteus mirabilis (ATCC 7002), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (ATCC 15305), Enterobacter Clocae (ATCC 13047), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883) and Candida albicans (ATCC 24433) were tested as representative strains for urine specimen. Pooled human negative clinical urine samples were used as the best representative of the intended use sample type for transport and downstream analysis. In brief, the samples were prepared by suspending each of above-indicated freshly cultured organisms into human negative clinical urine. A minimum of three different dilutions of stock culture were used to obtain a colony count of 25-250 per plate and the appropriate dilution factor was considered in determining the viable count in $\mathrm { C F U / m L }$ . Sponge applicator of UriSponge devices of three lots (new, middle aged, and recently expired) were immersed into contrived urine sample for 5 seconds and returned to UriSponge tube and incubated for 0 hrs. (less than 20-minutes), 24 hrs., and 48 hrs. at 2-8 $^ \circ \mathrm { C }$ and $1 9 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . At the end of each incubation period, the devices were centrifuged, and the absorbed sample were released, and aliquots of sample were spread onto appropriate agar plates and incubated in appropriate environment for 24-48 hours. Following incubation, colony forming units (CFU) were counted. A colony count of 25-250 per plate for at least one dilution and the $\Delta \mathrm { L o g } _ { 1 0 } { \leq } 1$ and $\geq - 1$ between the average CFU/plate values at time zero $\mathrm { T } = 0$ hrs.) and at specific specimen incubation time (e.g., 24 hrs., 48 hrs., etc.) were considered acceptable to support a specimen stability claim for each target organism.

Microbial recovery study results support the ability of UriSponge device to maintain the recovery of the tested microorganisms in urine samples up to 48 hours when stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or at $1 9 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Fill Volume Flex Study: Impact of undersaturation of UriSponge Device:

The applicator sponge in the Urisponge device contains preservative to stabilize the urine sample. In situations when the applicator sponge is not fully saturated with the absorbed urine due to sponge undersaturation, the concentrated preservative may result in the creation of a toxic environment to the intended use organisms present in the urine sample. To determine the impact of sponge undersaturation on microbial recovery, a fill volume flex study was conducted with 3 newly manufactured lots and with three strains ( $E .$ . coli ATCC 25922, $P .$ . aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and S. agalactiae ATCC 13813) that exhibited the highest log reduction at 72 hours incubation. First, a preliminary fill volume study was conducted by immersing the applicator sponge in urine sample at different depths and for different durations of time. Based on the minimum acceptable release volume $( \geq 2 0 0 ~ \mu 1 )$ , the worst-case scenario for undersaturation was determined. Finally, a comparative microbial recovery evaluation (as described above) was conducted between the intended use workflow and the worst-case scenario. For both scenarios, a colony count of 25-250 per plate for at least one dilution and the $\Delta \mathrm { L o g } _ { 1 0 } \mathrm { \leq } 1$ and $\geq - 1$ between the average CFU/plate values between time zero ( $\mathrm { T } = 0$ hrs.) and at the end of final incubation time, were considered acceptable to support specimen stability. The study results for both the intended use workflow and the worst-case scenario met the study acceptance criteria. The results from the fill volume flex study thus indicate that there is no significant risk of toxicity to the intended use organism in the urine sample due to undersaturation of UriSponge device.
