# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The Colibrí is an instrument designed to be used as an accessory for downstream matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) analyzers. The Colibrí is comprised of the Colibrí instrument (including on-board pipetting system, spreader, and nephelometer), software, primary tubes for microbial suspension, and daily verification kit which automatically prepares target

slides for ID and microbial suspensions and purity plates for AST from isolated colonies. The Colibrí is designed to be used in conjunction with the Copan WASPLab to automate the plate incubation, plate management, image acquisition, colony selection, target slide preparation (for ID), microbial suspension preparation (for AST), and purity plate preparation steps of the ID and/or AST sample preparation workflow. Refer to the K223245 Decision Summary for the device description and performance characteristics of the Colibrí when used with the WASPLab.

The Colibrí automates the preparation of MALDI target slides for the bioMérieux VITEK MS or the Bruker MALDI Biotyper CA systems that are used in clinical laboratories for identification (ID) of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial species grown on plated media by MALDITOF MS. Refer to the K193138 Decision Summary for the device description and performance characteristics of the sample preparation for bacterial identification and MALDI-TOF MS workflow.

The Colibrí also automates the preparation of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial suspensions at a known concentration from isolated colonies for the bioMérieux VITEK 2 and Beckman Coulter MicroScan WalkAway that are used in clinical laboratories for AST analyses. The Colibrí is also used for purity plate preparation for purity assessments. Refer to the K220546 Decision Summary for the device description and performance characteristics of the sample preparation for AST workflow with the bioMérieux VITEK 2. The workflow for both AST systems is similar and both rely on isolated colony samples, although there are differences in the Primary and Secondary Tubes. For use with the VITEK 2, the Primary Tube and Secondary Tube are filled with saline for all organisms. For use with the Beckman Coulter MicroScan WalkAway, the operator will need to input the correct Primary Tube (which will contain either saline or water) in accordance with the MicroScan WalkAway IFU. The Secondary Tube will be automatically filled with either water with PLURONIC or Mueller-Hinton Broth with $3 \%$ lysed horse blood to prepare the final suspension in accordance with the MicroScan WalkAway IFU. The performance characteristics of the sample preparation for AST from isolated colony workflow with the Beckman Coulter MicroScan WalkAway are described in this submission.

# B Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: Colibrí

2. Specimen Identification:

Culture plates for processing are identified by the WASPLab by scanning a manually applied linear barcode on the side of each plate. The loading conveyor moves the plate inside the Imaging Module in the WASPLab, where the plate is checked in to the system through a barcode reader. The barcode is again scanned when the plate is manually transferred to the Colibrí. The barcode is used to orientate the plate and, together with the plate’s geometric center, also used to define the Cartesian coordinates of each of the colonies that are designated for picking. The designated colonies are then picked for the assigned downstream activities.

# 3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Plates labeled with a barcode on the side are loaded onto a conveyor and loaded into the WASPLab. The barcode is scanned, and the plate is incubated within the WASPLab. After appropriate incubation, each plate is photographed, and the image is saved on the WASPLab server and is displayed to the operator on the WebApp interface. After selecting isolated colonies and assigning the downstream task, the user manually transfers the plate to the Colibrí. Within the Colibrí, the plates are prepared for ID (as described in the K193138 Decision Summary) or AST (as described in the K220546 Decision Summary).

4. Calibration:

Colibrí requires four different calibrations: one on the on-board nephelometer and three on the cameras. No changes are made in set-up calibration, auto-calibration, and run-time calibration checks which are performed as described in the K193138 Decision Summary. No changes are made to daily nephelometer verification, which is performed as described in the K220546 Decision Summary.

The WASPLab does not require calibration.

5. Quality Control:

Quality Control for AST testing was performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions for the Beckman Coulter MicroScan. CLSI-recommended reference strains Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 were grown on trypticase soy agar $+ 5 \%$ sheep blood. Microbial suspensions were prepared using three separate Colibrí instruments and loaded in the appropriate MicroScan panel. MIC values for each drug/organism combination were compared to the established ranges reported in the MicroScan panel labeling. Purity of all the suspensions was confirmed by purity plates prepared by the Colibrí, with $100 \%$ of purity plates showing monomicrobial growth. Quality control testing was performed daily during analytical performance testing using the quality control bacterial strains in rotation, and all results obtained were in-range. Results are summarized in Table 1. The quality control testing is acceptable.

Quality control for bacterial identification is described in the K193138 Decision Summary. Quality control for AST with the bioMérieux VITEK 2 was conducted in a similar manner and is described in the K220546 Decision Summary. Additional quality control measures are not needed for the WASPLab.

# A Analytical Performance:

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility:

The reproducibility of MIC results obtained using microbial suspensions automatically prepared from isolated colonies by the Colibrí was evaluated with the Beckman Coulter MicroScan WalkAway. Inter-operator reproducibility of the Colibrí was previously demonstrated in K220546 and K223245. For the reproducibility study with the MicroScan, three Colibrí instruments paired with one WASPLab instrument were used to prepare microbial suspensions from overnight (18 to 24 hour) cultures of 18 representative, clinically relevant bacterial isolates grown on trypticase soy agar with $5 \%$ sheep blood. Representative MicroScan AST panels were chosen for analysis and were tested with pure colonies of nine gram-negative isolates and nine gram-positive isolates (summarized in Table 2). Each panel included drugs representing different drug classes.

Each isolate was tested in triplicate on three separate days using the appropriate MicroScan panel. On each day of testing, one operator designated at least four (for gram negative) or six (for gram positive) colonies for automated picking from digital images acquired by the WASPLab of each of the three culture plates corresponding to each isolate. A minimum of 117 MIC results were analyzed per panel per instrument.

Samples were prepared and assessed for purity consistent with the Colibrí instructions for use. The final suspension in the Secondary Tube was used to manually inoculate the appropriate MicroScan AST panel. The secondary tubes and corresponding AST cards were processed by one MicroScan WalkAway instrument. The reported MIC values were used to calculate within-run and between-run reproducibility.

Reproducibility was calculated as the total number of MIC results that were within one doubling dilution of the mode result divided by total number of results. Both best-case (assumes that off-scale results are within one dilution of the mode) and worst-case (assumes that off-scale results are more than one dilution of the mode) performance was determined for each antimicrobial, as outlined in the AST Special Controls Guidance.

In total, 2,619 MIC results were generated with 2,602 of those results being on-scale. The results for all samples are summarized and stratified by the tested MicroScan panel in Table 3. For antimicrobials across all panels evaluated, the combined best-case reproducibility was $2 9 5 \%$ and combined worst-case reproducibility was $2 8 9 \%$ . All purity plates displayed monomicrobial growth. The reproducibility results are acceptable.

4. Accuracy (Instrument):

# Microbial Suspension Accuracy

The ability of the Colibrí to prepare accurate microbial suspensions in Primary and Secondary Tubes compatible for use with the Beckman Coulter MicroScan WalkAway was assessed using representative organisms. Isolated colonies were used by the Colibrí to automatically prepare microbial suspensions. Briefly, four microorganisms (E. coli, $P _ { - }$ . aeruginosa, S. aureus and $E .$ . faecalis) were individually plated on trypticase soy agar $+ 5 \%$ sheep blood and incubated for 18-24 hours. Streptococcus microbial suspensions were previously evaluated in K220546 and taken together with the AST accuracy study described herein (in which 48 Streptococcus isolates were evaluated), the results were deemed acceptable. Accuracy of microbial suspensions prepared with the Colibrí from MacConkey and Chocolate agar media was evaluated in K220546. One operator viewed the plate images acquired by one WASPLab instrument and designated four (for gram-negative) or six (for gram-positive) colonies for picking. Three Colibrí instruments were used to prepare Primary Tubes and Secondary Tubes. Secondary Tubes were manually diluted, plated in triplicate, and incubated overnight to determine colony counts and calculate concentration (CFU/mL).

Concentrations were deemed acceptable if they were within the expected ranges reported in the AST Special Controls guidance $( 3 { - } 7 { \mathrm { x } } 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { \dot { C } F U / m L }$ for $E .$ . coli) or CLSI M07 $( 2 \mathrm { - } 8 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ CFU/mL) documents. Accuracy was calculated as the percentage of Secondary Tubes with microbial concentrations within the expected range. At least 30 microbial suspensions were prepared for each species. For the tested species, Primary Tubes were filled with saline and Secondary Tubes were filled with MicroScan Inoculum Water with PLURONIC, in accordance with the MicroScan IFU. The summary of agreement between the expected concentration and the concentration calculated by colony count is shown in Table 4 below, stratified by Colibrí instrument and microorganism. Agreement for each species and each instrument was $2 9 5 \%$ and overall agreement was $2 9 8 \%$ . The microbial suspension accuracy results are acceptable.

# Accuracy of AST Results

The accuracy of MICs obtained by the Beckman Coulter MicroScan WalkAway with microbial suspensions prepared by the Colibrí was evaluated by testing representative MicroScan panels with isolated colonies of clinically relevant gram-negative and grampositive bacteria. Three different Colibrí instruments with one WASPLab operated by three different operators were used to prepare suspensions for testing of from colonies of 110 representative isolates of different species of Enterobacterales $( \mathrm { n } { = } 5 0 )$ , Staphylococcus spp. $( \mathrm { n } { = } 2 0 )$ ), Streptococcus spp. $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 2 )$ ), Enterococcus spp. $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 8 )$ ), and non-fermenting gramnegative bacilli $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 0 )$ ) grown on trypticase soy agar $+ 5 \%$ sheep blood and/or MacConkey agar. Refer to Table 2 for the panels included in the AST challenge study.

MicroScan panels containing broad concentrations of antimicrobials representative of major drug classes (Table 2) were tested with representative clinical isolates: NM-NF50 covering Enterobacterales and non-fermenters, PM-E37 covering Staphylococci and Enterococci, and MSP6 covering Streptococci. Use of these panels is acceptable because a wider MIC range was validated with the same sample type (i.e., colonies) and determined to be acceptable, as described in the applicable MicroScan decision summaries. Twenty-nine different antimicrobial agents were analyzed, resulting in a total of 1,232 MIC results.

The MIC results obtained with suspensions prepared from isolated colonies by the Colibrí and tested on the MicroScan WalkAway system were compared to the results from manually prepared samples and the MicroScan WalkAway system. Manual samples were prepared from isolated colonies consistent with the MicroScan system instructions for use.

Essential Agreement (EA) was defined as MIC results from Colibrí prepared samples that were within one doubling dilution of the MIC results from the manually prepared samples. Category Agreement (CA) was defined as MIC interpretations (S/I/R) that were the same between the Colibrí-prepared and manually prepared samples. Very major errors were defined as false susceptible results from the Colibrí-prepared samples, major errors were defined as false resistance results from the Colibrí-prepared samples, and minor errors were defined as results with minor discrepancies (i.e., an intermediate result reported as either resistant or susceptible, or vice versa). Since this is a method-to-method comparison, results were considered acceptable if the EA and CA were $2 9 5 \%$ with no major or very major errors. Additionally, no significant differences should be observed between the Colibrí instruments, operators, culture medium, or incubation time.

Overall performance of MicroScan results using microbial suspensions prepared from isolated colonies by the Colibrí demonstrated that 1232/1232 $( 1 0 0 \% )$ of MIC results were within EA and 4187/4254 $( 9 8 . 4 \% )$ of results were in CA, which is acceptable. No very major or major errors occurred. All purity plates exhibited $100 \%$ monomicrobial growth.

Table 5 summarizes the results stratified by antimicrobial/organism group combinations. Due to the high degree of agreement between MICs obtained from manual and Colibrí- prepared samples, the AST accuracy was determined to be acceptable.
