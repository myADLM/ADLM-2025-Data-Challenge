Device Name Aptima HCV Quant Dx Assay

Indications for Use (Describe)

The Aptima HCV Quant Dx assay is a real-time transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) test used for both detection and quantitation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in fresh and frozen human serum and plasma from HCV-infected individuals.

Plasma may be prepared in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), anticoagulant citrate dextrose (ACD) solution, and plasma preparation tubes (PPT). Serum may be prepared in serum tubes and serum separator tubes (SST). Specimens are tested using the Panther system for automated specimen processing, amplification, detection, and quantitation. Specimens containing HCV genotypes 1 to 6 are validated for detection and quantitation in the assay.

The Aptima HCV Quant Dx assay is indicated for use as an aid in the diagnosis of active HCV infection in the following populations: individuals with antibody evidence of HCV infection with evidence of liver disease, individuals suspected to be actively infected with HCV antibody evidence, and individuals at risk for HCV infection with antibodies to HCV. Detection of HCV RNA indicates that the virus is replicating and, therefore, is evidence of active infection. Detection of HCV RNA does not discriminate between acute and chronic states of infection.

The Aptima HCV Quant Dx assay is also indicated for use as an aid in the management of HCV infected patients undergoing HCV antiviral drug therapy. The assay can be used to measure HCV RNA levels periodically prior to, during, and after treatment to determine sustained virological response (SVR) or nonsustained virological response (NSVR). Assay performance characteristics have been established for individuals infected with HCV and treated with certain direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) regimens. No information is available on the assay’s predictive value when other therapies are used. The results from the Aptima HCV Quant Dx assay must be interpreted within the context of all relevant clinical and laboratory findings.

The Aptima HCV Quant Dx assay is not approved for use as a screening test for the presence of HCV RNA in blood or blood products.

# III. PREDICATE DEVICE

The predicate device is the Aptima HCV Quant Dx assay; P160023, originally approved as a Class III PMA product, reclassified to a Class II 510(k) product on November 26, 2021.

# IV. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

Clearance of this pre-market application will 1) enable additional reagent on-board / off-board cycling, allowing operators to load reagents onto the Panther System 8 times instead of 5 times; and 2) update the Assay Definition Module (ADM) to detect, flag and invalidate results impacted by a faulty or flickering LED, using estimated background minimum limits. These changes do not introduce any changes to the original design, method of manufacture, assay procedure, principle of operation, mechanism of action, conditions of use or hardware of the Panther instrument, or to the results interpretation for the cleared assay.

# Principles of the Procedure

The principles of the procedure are unchanged.

The Aptima HCV Quant Dx assay is a nucleic acid amplification test that uses real-time TMA technology to detect and quantitate HCV RNA for aiding diagnosis or to establish baseline viral load, as well as to measure on-treatment and post-treatment responses. The assay targets a conserved region of the HCV genome, detecting and quantitating genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The assay is standardized against the 2nd WHO International Standard for Hepatitis C Virus (NIBSC Code 96/798).12

The Aptima HCV Quant Dx assay involves three main steps, which all take place in a single tube on the Panther system: target capture, target amplification by TMA, and detection of the amplification products (amplicon) by the fluorescent labeled probes (torches).

During target capture, viral RNA is isolated from specimens. The specimen is treated with a detergent to solubilize the viral envelope, denature proteins, and release viral genomic RNA. Capture oligonucleotides hybridize to highly conserved regions of HCV RNA, if present, in the test specimen. The hybridized target is then captured onto magnetic microparticles that are separated from the specimen in a magnetic field. Wash steps remove extraneous components from the reaction tube.

Target amplification occurs via TMA, which is a transcription-mediated nucleic acid amplification method that utilizes two enzymes, Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase and T7 RNA polymerase. The reverse transcriptase is used to generate a DNA copy (containing a promoter sequence for T7 RNA polymerase) of the target sequence. T7 RNA polymerase produces multiple copies of RNA amplicon from the DNA copy template. The Aptima HCV Quant Dx assay utilizes the TMA method to amplify a portion of the $_ 5 \cdot$ UTR of the HCV genome. Amplification of this region is achieved using specific primers which are designed to amplify HCV genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Detection is achieved using single-stranded nucleic acid torches that are present during the amplification of the target and that hybridize specifically to the amplicon in real time. Each torch has a fluorophore and a quencher. When the torch is not hybridized to the amplicon, the quencher is in close proximity of the fluorophore and suppresses the fluorescence. When the torch binds to the amplicon, the quencher is moved farther away from the fluorophore and it will emit a signal at a specific wavelength when excited by a light source. As more torches hybridize to amplicon a higher fluorescent signal is generated. The time taken for the fluorescent signal to reach a specified threshold is proportional to the starting HCV concentration. Each reaction has an internal calibrator/internal control (IC) that controls for variations in specimen processing, amplification, and detection. The concentration of a sample is determined by the Panther system software using the HCV and IC signals for each reaction and comparing them to calibration information.

# Assay Components

The reagents required to perform the Aptima HCV Quant Dx assay are available in 100-test kits. The kits are packaged in 3 boxes containing 11 reagents which are required for sample processing.

# Assay Verification (Flickering LED process control change)

Fluorescent curve files and logs from 381 field instruments and 445,910 unique test orders from March 2018 to March 2022 were analyzed. Test orders with outlier estimated background values were excluded by specific root-cause analysis where applicable. Incomplete fluorescent curve files due to a date split were excluded from analysis.

HCV Estimated Background distributions were analyzed by each channel, FAM and ROX as seen below. Data were approximately normal for each channel. Proposed estimated background limits would be 5σ or five standard deviations from the mean, respectively. One test order was flagged by FAM estimated background limit and was also flagged by QNS; this test order was considered a true fault.

There were no anomalies identified during the V&V of the Panther Aptima HCV ADM on Panther System Software Version 7.2.9.

It has been concluded from the overall testing that the Panther Aptima HCV assay on the Panther System Software Version 7.2.9 meets the intended use and safety requirements.

# Additional Studies

The FDA issued a hold letter on January 3, 2024 with a request for additional information in two parts as described below, with Hologic responses following:

# 1. Intended Use Testing

An Intended Use Testing study using a minimum of four (4) clinical specimens including: three (3) specimens/samples with HCV RNA concentration around 3xLLoQ $\left( 3 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m l } \right)$ and one (1) HCV RNA negative clinical specimen. Samples may be prepared by diluting a high positive sample in negative clinical matrix. FDA recommends testing 10 replicates of each sample per run, using previous Aptima HCV software version 5.2.5.1 and the updated version 5.3.5.1.

• A revised study report including a clear description of the study and the nature of samples used (e.g., natural or contrived), data analysis, summary of the results and conclusions, and line data in Excel format.

The requested study was carried out, Aptima HCV Assay Software versions 5.2.5.1 and 5.3.5.1 successfully completed and met all acceptance criteria with low level clinical panel. The Aptima HCV Assay Software version 5.2.5.1 and Aptima HCV Assay Software version 5.3.5.1 both resulted in $100 \%$ not detected for the negative clinical matrix panel. The Aptima HCV Assay Software version 5.2.5.1 and Aptima HCV Assay Software version 5.3.5.1 both resulted in $100 \%$ positivity for the $3 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ (low positive) clinical positive panel. Acceptance criteria for this panel is positivity only and has no accuracy or precision specifications. The requested files are included in this supplement.

# 2. On-Board Stability (OBS) and Reagent Cycling

To support the additional reagent on-board/off-board cycling, please provide the following:

An OBS and reagent cycling study including a minimum of one negative sample, a sample around 3xLLoQ: $3 0 \mathrm { I U / m l }$ , and a moderate positive or high positive sample. Please include a minimum of 5 replicates per sample for each timepoint with more replicates tested at baseline to establish a robust baseline. Please perform the testing using the updated Panther system software version 7.2.9 and Aptima HCV software version 5.3.5.1 or provide a justification for why software changes would not impact the reagent stability results.

• A revised study report, including a detailed study description and the nature of samples used (e.g., natural or contrived), data analysis, summary of the results, line data in Excel format, and conclusions clearly stating the supported OBS and reagent cycling claim. Note, in order to support a claim of 8 times reagent cycling, please evaluate at minimum, the number of cycles previously claimed (5 cycles), the number of cycles currently claimed (8 cycles) and an additional number of cycles that goes beyond the one currently claimed (9 to 10 cycles) using the same kit when possible. This ensures that the reagent stability does not change one time point after the desired claim.

The requested study was carried out, and Aptima reagents successfully completed five, eight, and ten on and off on-board cycles with a cumulative 72 hours on board stability and met all acceptance criteria.

# VIII. CONCLUSIONS

The validation study results demonstrate that the Aptima HCV Quant Dx assay on the 7.2.9 Panther system software performs comparably to the predicate device and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
