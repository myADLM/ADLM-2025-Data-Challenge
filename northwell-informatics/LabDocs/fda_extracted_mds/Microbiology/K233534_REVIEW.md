# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The Hardy Diagnostics Viral Transport Medium is a non-propagating transport media used for the collection and transport of clinical specimens suspected of containing viruses for viral culture and detection. The VTM consists of Hank's Balanced Salt Solution, a buffer to maintain a neutral $\mathsf { p H }$ , and fetal bovine serum, sucrose for specimen stabilization, along with Amphotericin B and Gentamicin Sulfate to inhibit bacterial and fungal growth. VTM also contains a $\mathsf { p H }$ indicator (phenol red) to provide a visual check on medium pH. The VTM appears translucent and light peach in color.

The Hardy Diagnostics Viral Transport Medium includes a polypropylene screw-cap tube with skirted conical bottom containing $3 \mathrm { m L }$ of transport medium. The product is supplied in multiple configurations described in table 1 below: tubes alone, or in a kit format with a swab.

# B Principle of Operation:

Clinical specimens are aseptically collected using swabs (polyester (Dacron), rayon, or flocked nylon) and shafts (plastic or flexible wire) that are non-toxic to viral agents. Swabs with a scored breakpoint at or less than $1 0 0 \mathrm { m m }$ are recommended. The TransPRO Viral Transport Medium (VTM) System includes an individually wrapped, sterile, mini-tip flocked swab with an $8 0 \mathrm { m m }$ breakpoint. After collection of specimens, cap is removed from the tube and swab is inserted into the media. The swab shaft is cut with scissors or broken off by bending the shaft at the scored breakpoint against the rim of the tube. The us swab shaft is required to be below the rim of the tube to facilitate proper cap closure of the tube. The tubes may then be stored or transported at the permissible temperature.

Hardy Diagnostics’ VTM has the following ingredients.

• Hank’s Balanced Salts Solution (HBSS)   
• Bovine Serum Albumin   
• Amphotericin B   
• Gentamicin Sulfate   
• L-Glutamic Acid   
• Sucrose   
• Phenol Red

HBBS, bovine albumin, and sucrose provide stabilization to the specimen. Gentamicin Sulfate and Amphotericin B inhibit bacterial and fungal contamination, respectively. Phenol red functions as a pH indicator.

# VI Standards/Guidance Documents Referenced:

Not applicable.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

A Analytical Performance:

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference: Not applicable.

4. Assay Reportable Range: Not applicable.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

Shelf-life:

To evaluate Shelf-life, real-time stability studies were conducted with Hardy Diagnostics’ VTM lots in a real-time aging study at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Three VTM lots were tested qualitatively for appearance (e.g., visual inspection for turbidity, precipitation, color, etc.), $\mathsf { p H }$ (acceptable range: $7 . 3 \pm 0 . 2 $ , fill volume (measured by weight), virus viability at every month from 0 to 12 months. All results met the study acceptance criteria and support a shelflife stability of Hardy Diagnostics’ VTM for up to 12 months at $2 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Performance Testing - Recovery Studies:

The performance of Hardy Diagnostics Viral Transport Medium (VTM) was evaluated for culture-based recovery of Influenza A, Influenza B, Echovirus, Adenovirus, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Pooled negative clinical matrix was spiked with known concentration of virus and then the contrived viral samples were transferred with swabs into subject VTM and held at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $2 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 0, 24, and 48 hours. The viral recovery study was conducted with three variously aged lots of $3 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ VTM covering the claimed shelf-life. At the end of each time point media stored under each temperature range, an aliquot of incubated samples were serially diluted, and inoculated in triplicate into the susceptible host cell line. After 24-72 hours, Viral quantification was determined by microscopic observation of virus induced CPE to determine the fifty-percent tissue culture infective dose $\mathrm { ( T C I D _ { 5 0 } / m L ) }$ ) using the Reed-Muench method. Results were considered acceptable if the average viral recovery for each time point and storage condition demonstrate any percent changes within $\pm 9 0 \%$ (i.e., 1 log change) from baseline $( \mathrm { T } { = } 0 )$ .

Table 2 and Table 3 below exhibit the viral recovery performance of the Hardy Diagnostics Viral Transport Medium at $2 0 – 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ respectively.
