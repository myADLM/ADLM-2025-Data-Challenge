Dear Dominique Monferrer:

We have reviewed your section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database available at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

# 9. Performance Summary

Clinical Study

A multisite clinical study to compare the reference method with ADVIA Centaur EBV-EBNA IgG was performed.

# Comparison of Results: Total Study Population

A total of 1428 leftover samples were collected over a contiguous time period from individuals for whom an EBV test was ordered (population 1). Of these, 188 were from unclassified serostatus individuals. One-hundred sixty-seven (167) samples with a known EBV EBNA IgG negative result (population 2) were evaluated as well. Of these, 14 were from unclassified serostatus individuals. The study results otherwise showed that these populations included individuals with acute infection, past infection, or no serologic evidence of EBV infection.

Samples were tested using the ADVIA Centaur EBVnaG assay and an FDA cleared EBV EBNA IgG reference assay. Equivocal reference assay results were resolved by 2 other comparative assays. The results obtained are presented in the following tables:
