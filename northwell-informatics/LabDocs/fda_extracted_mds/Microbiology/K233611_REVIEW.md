1 The SPOTFIRE R Panel is available as a standalone assay (K213954) or as a selectable option within the SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel (K232954) based on the type of specimen to be tested.   
2 The SPOTFIRE ST Panel is available as a selectable option within the SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel (K232954) based on the type of specimen to be tested.   
3 For patient samples, the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R Panel (K213954) and R/ST Panel (K232954) report a single result for all 4 seasonal Coronavirus species in combination; for Quality Control testing, the assay for each individual seasonal Coronavirus must produce the expected result.   
4 In common with the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R Panel (K213954) and R/ST Panel (K232954), the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R Panel Mini (K230719) cannot distinguish Human Rhinovirus and Enterovirus; however, to simplify the test report, the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R Panel Mini refers to both analytes as Human Rhinovirus   
5 For patient samples, the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R Panel (K213954) and R/ST Panel (K232954) report a single result for all 4 Parainfluenza Virus serotypes in combination; for Quality Control testing, the assay for each individual Parainfluenza Virus serotype must produce the expected result.

# B Principle of Operation:

The SPOTFIRE RSP Positive and Negative Controls are processed according to the instructions for quality control testing provided by the manufacturer of the applicable BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Panel assays (Respiratory/Sore Throat (R/ST) [K232954], Respiratory (R) [K213954] and Respiratory (R) Mini [K230719]). Results are reported automatically by the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Panel Software as either “PASS”, “FAIL” or “INVALID [failure reason]”.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision and reproducibility of results obtained with the SPOTFIRE RSP Positive and Negative Controls was evaluated using different batches of finished material that were tested with multiple lots of BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel reagents, over multiple days, with multiple operators and using multiple BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Systems. Three lots of SPOTFIRE RSP Positive Controls and 4 lots of SPOTFIRE RSP Negative Controls were included in the study, as described below.

# External Sites

Testing was performed at 5 sites that were representative of the Intended Use environment for the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel (i.e., sites performing near-patient testing). The SPOTFIRE RSP Positive and Negative Controls were tested according to the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel instructions for use as intended during normal, dayto-day operations (e.g., training a new operator, upon receipt of new reagents or a new instrument, or following instrument service). The number of control panels tested varied by site according to the number of operators and volume of BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel testing performed. A total of 37 BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Systems was used across the 5 study sites in conjunction with 25 lots of BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel pouches.

# Internal Maine Molecular Site

Testing of the SPOTFIRE RSP Positive and Negative Controls internally at Maine Molecular Quality Controls (MMQC) was performed over multiple days on a single BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System by 3 operators using 3 lots of control panels and 3 lots of BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel pouches.

In total, 361 controls were tested across all sites, including 179 Positive Controls and 182 Negative Controls (Table 2). There were 10 invalid results affecting 7 Positive Controls and 3 Negative Controls (7 due to internal pouch control failure and 3 due to instrument errors). All controls with invalid results were repeated yielding a total of 351 valid control results (172 Positive Controls and 179 Negative Controls). One Positive Control failed because negative results were obtained for 4 of the target analytes. All other control results were as expected. The overall Positive Control failure rate was $0 . 6 \%$ (1/172).

The reproducibility and precision of the SPOTFIRE RSP Positive and Negative Controls was acceptable.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

Real-time Reagent Stability Studies Real-time Reagent Stability Studies to establish/verify the shelf-life of the SPOTFIRE RSP Positive and Negative Controls are ongoing and include testing of 3 lots of each control type stored under different conditions: room temperature (18 to $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ), refrigerated $( 2 \mathrm { - } 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ or frozen (-25 to $- 1 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ). Testing of the SPOTFIRE RSP Positive and Negative Controls will be performed at intervals over at least 36 months or until product degradation is observed.

Expiration dating on the SPOTFIRE RSP Control product label will be based on the data obtained for real-time room temperature storage at $2 { - } 2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# E Expected Values/Reference Range:

The expected results for each analyte monitored by the SPOTFIRE RSP Positive and Negative Controls with each applicable BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Panel are shown in Table 3. For each panel, the SPOTFIRE Panel Software reports the control results as either “Pass”, “Fail” or “Invalid” based on the combination of the individual test results within the panel.

In common with the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel and R Panel, the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R Panel Mini cannot distinguish Human Rhinovirus and Enterovirus; however, to simplify the test report, the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R Panel Mini refers to both analytes as Human Rhinovirus.
