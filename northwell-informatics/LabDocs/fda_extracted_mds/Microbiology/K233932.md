# Biological Principles of the Procedure

The Alinity i Toxo IgM assay is an automated, two-step immunoassay for the qualitative detection of IgM antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii in human serum and plasma using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology.

Pre-diluted sample and anti-human IgM murine monoclonal antibody coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined and incubated. Together with IgM antibodies of other specificities, anti-Toxo specific IgM present in the sample binds to the anti-human IgM murine monoclonal antibody coated microparticles, forming an antibody-antibody complex. The mixture is washed. A conjugate complex consisting of an acridinium-labeled anti-Toxo $\mathsf { p } 3 0$ antigen murine monoclonal F(ab')2 fragment and native Toxoplasma gondii lysate, containing the p30 antigen, is added to create a reaction mixture and incubated. This conjugate complex is bound by anti-Toxo specific IgM that has been captured by the anti-human IgM murine monoclonal antibody coated microparticles, forming an antibody-antibody-conjugate complex. Following a wash cycle, Pre-Trigger and Trigger Solutions are added.

The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as a relative light unit (RLU). There is a direct relationship between the amount of anti-Toxo IgM in the sample and the RLU detected by the system optics.

The presence or absence of anti-Toxo IgM in the sample is determined by comparing the chemiluminescent RLU in the reaction to the cutoff RLU determined from an active calibration.

# VI. Intended Use of the Device

The Alinity i Toxo IgM assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) used for the qualitative detection of IgM antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii in human serum, serum separator, and plasma tubes (lithium heparin, lithium heparin separator, and tripotassium EDTA) on the Alinity i system.

The Alinity i Toxo IgM assay is to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of acute or recent Toxoplasma gondii infection in suspected individuals including women of child-bearing age. It is recommended that the assay be performed in conjunction with a Toxoplasma gondii IgG assay.

a One out of 10 RF specimens was falsely reactive with the Alinity i Toxo IgM assay.

# D. Matrix Equivalency

A study was performed to evaluate whether specific blood collection tube types are suitable for use with the Alinity i Toxo IgM assay. The matrix collection tube type equivalency study was conducted including 43 donors of reactive (20 donors) and nonreactive (23 donors) samples in 5 types of blood collection tubes (serum, serum separator, lithium heparin plasma, lithium heparin plasma separator, and tripotassium EDTA plasma) for use with the Alinity i Toxo IgM assay. Data was analyzed using regression analysis comparing numerical S/CO results of all matrices to serum to evaluate any potential bias. All of the blood collection tube types tested are acceptable for use with the Alinity i Toxo IgM assay.

# E. Class Specificity

Class specificity testing of the Alinity i Toxo IgM assay demonstrated reactivity only to human anti-Toxoplamsa IgM. No reactivity to human anti-Toxoplasma IgG was observed.

# F. CDC Panel Agreement

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Toxoplasma 1998 Human Serum Panel was tested using the Alinity i Toxo IgM assay. The Alinity i Toxo IgM assay results were submitted to the CDC for data analysis and for the result interpretation for each sample. The panel consisted of 32 true positive Toxoplasma specimens and 65 true negative Toxoplasma specimens. The Alinity i Toxo IgM assay detected the 32 positive specimens as reactive and the 65 negative specimens as nonreactive. The CDC performed kit sensitivity (positive percent agreement [PPA]) and kit specificity (negative percent agreement [NPA]) analyses and sent the results to Abbott.

The percent agreement of the Alinity i Toxo IgM assay relative to the CDC results was calculated. The PPA was $100 \%$ with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval (CI) of $8 9 . 2 8 \%$ to $1 0 0 . 0 0 \%$ . The NPA was $100 \%$ with a $9 5 \%$ CI of $9 4 . 4 2 \%$ to $1 0 0 . 0 0 \%$ .

The results are presented as a means to convey further information on the performance of this assay with a masked, characterized serum panel. This does not imply endorsement of the assay by the CDC.
