# Methodology

The T2Candida 1.1 Panel u�lizes magne�c resonance-based detec�on $\mathbb { T } 2 ^ { \otimes } \mathbb { M } \mathbb { R }$ technology) to qualita�vely detect five species of Candida: Candida albicans and/or Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida glabrata and/or Candida krusei, direct from K2EDTA-treated human whole blood. The T2Candida 1.1 Panel, run on the T2Dx instrument, performs sample concentra�on and Candida target DNA amplifica�on for direct detec�on of species-specific amplicon at a limit of detec�on as low as 1 CFU/mL in approximately 3.5 hours. The test incorporates an Internal Control (IC) for monitoring test performance.

# Device Descrip�on

The T2Candida 1.1 Panel and T2Dx Instrument is comprised of the T2Candida 1.1 Panel performed on the T2Dx Instrument. The T2Candida 1.1 Panel is a qualita�ve molecular diagnos�c assay that employs a whole blood compa�ble PCR amplifica�on followed by T2 magne�c resonance (T2MR) detec�on. The T2Candida 1.1 Panel is performed on the T2Dx Instrument which executes all steps a�er specimen loading. A K2EDTA whole blood specimen is loaded onto the T2Candida 1.1 Sample Inlet, which is then placed on the T2Candida 1.1 Cartridge along with the T2Candida 1.1 Reagent Tray. The Reagent Tray contains the internal control, amplifica�on reagent, enzyme and the probe-coupled superparamagne�c par�cles for each Candida target. Two milliliters of the blood specimen is transferred to the T2Dx Instrument where lysis of the red blood cells, concentra�on and lysis of the Candida cells and amplifica�on of the Candida DNA takes place. Amplifica�on products are detected by T2MR detec�on using species-specific probes which are atached to the superparamagne�c par�cles. The assay iden�fies Candida albicans and/or Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida glabrata and/or Candida krusei. The test does not dis�nguish between C. albicans and C. tropicalis. The test does not dis�nguish between C. glabrata and C. krusei

# Analy�cal Studies

Cross-reac�vity was previously assessed in DEN140019. Addi�onal cross-reac�vity tes�ng was performed in this submission using five organisms clinically relevant to pediatric popula�ons: Streptococcus agalactiae, Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus mitis, and Neisseria meningitidis.

Isolates were tested in triplicate at a concentra�on of $1 0 ^ { 6 } C F \mathsf { U / m L }$ . Any organism that demonstrated cross-reac�vity or gave an invalid result was further evaluated with addi�onal replicates from two addi�onal sample prepara�ons at the same concentra�on and was tested at lower, more clinically relevant concentra�ons of organisms in blood (100-1000 CFU/mL).

Cross-reac�vity was defined as an increase in the T2 signal above the established cutoff for the Candida detec�on channel when tested at clinically relevant concentra�ons. Cross-reac�vity required both amplifica�on of the organism with Candida primers and subsequent detec�on with any of the capture probes. Of the five organisms tested, two demonstrated cross-reac�vity at $1 0 ^ { 6 } C F \mathsf { U / m L }$ (S. agalactiae, H. influenzae). Cross-reac�vity was not observed when the organisms were re-tested at $1 0 0 0 \ : \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ . The remaining three organisms did not demonstrate cross-reac�vity (Table 1).

# Summary of Clinical Performance – Pediatric Subjects

Clinical data from exis�ng studies were used to support the use of T2Candida 1.1 Panel in tes�ng pediatric pa�ent samples. Two (2) peer-reviewed publica�ons were iden�fied where the T2Candida 1.1 Panel was u�lized to test pediatric pa�ents and performance was compared to blood culture results. A total of 246 pediatric samples were evaluated in accordance with the T2Candida 1.1 Panel Instruc�ons for Use over the course of the two studies. Pa�ent ages ranged from 23 weeks to 17 years. Low prevalence (as determined by posi�ve blood culture) was observed $( 1 . 2 \% )$ . For all samples, es�mates of sensi�vity (PPA) ranged from $5 0 \small { - } 1 0 0 \%$ and specificity (NPA) ranged from $9 7 - 9 9 \%$ .

Results of these studies and the exis�ng adult study data demonstrate acceptable performance of the T2Candida 1.1 Panel to detect Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida glabrata and Candida krusei infec�on.
