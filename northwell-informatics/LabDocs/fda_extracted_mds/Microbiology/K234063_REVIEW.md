# A Purpose for Submission:

To amend the T2Candida 1.1 Panel labeling regarding testing with pediatric patients.

# B Measurand:

The assay amplifies and detects nucleic acids of the following species:   
Candida albicans and/or Candida tropicalis   
Candida parapsilosis   
Candida krusei and/or Candida glabrata

# C Type of Test:

The T2Candida 1.1 Panel, performed on the T2Dx Instrument, is a molecular diagnostic assay for the detection of the above listed Candida species from whole blood specimens obtained from patients with signs and symptoms of invasive Candida infection.

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

T2Candida 1.1 Panel and T2Dx Instrument is a qualitative T2 Magnetic Resonance (T2MR) assay for the direct detection of Candida species in ${ \mathrm { K } } _ { 2 }$ EDTA human whole blood specimens from patients with symptoms of, or medical conditions predisposing the patient to, invasive fungal infections.

The T2Candida 1.1 Panel identifies five species of Candida and categorizes them into the following three species groups:

1. Candida albicans and/or Candida tropicalis

2. Candida parapsilosis

3. Candida glabrata and/or Candida krusei

The T2Candida 1.1 Panel does not distinguish between $C .$ . albicans and $C .$ . tropicalis. The T2Candida 1.1 Panel does not distinguish between $C .$ . glabrata and $C .$ . krusei.

The T2Candida 1.1 Panel is indicated for the presumptive diagnosis of candidemia. The T2Candida 1.1 Panel is performed independent of blood culture. Concomitant blood cultures are necessary to recover organisms for susceptibility testing or further identification, and for organisms not detected by the T2Candida 1.1 Panel.

The T2Candida positive and negative External Controls (T2Candida QCheck Positive Kit and the T2Dx QCheck Negative Kit) are intended to be used as quality control samples with the T2Candida 1.1 Panel when run on the T2Dx Instrument. These controls are not intended for use with other assays or systems.

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Rx - For Prescription Use Only

For In Vitro Diagnostic Use

Device performance was initially established with samples from adult patients. Panel performance with samples from pediatric patients was supported by additional studies with pediatric subjects. Panel performance with samples from neonates has not been established.

# D Special Instrument Requirements:

The T2Candida 1.1 Panel is performed on the T2Dx Instrument.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The T2Candida 1.1 panel is a qualitative molecular diagnostic assay that detects Candida species directly from whole blood. Together with the T2Dx Instrument, the T2Candida 1.1 panel uses whole blood compatible PCR amplification followed by T2 magnetic resonance (T2MR) detection. The T2Dx Instrument was originally evaluated in DEN140019 and is unchanged in this submission.

To initiate testing, at least $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of whole blood specimen is collected into a 4 mL $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA vacutainer. The sample tube is loaded into the T2Candida Sample Inlet, which is then placed on the T2Candida Base along with the T2Candida Reagent Tray. The Reagent Tray contains the internal control, amplification reagent, enzyme, and the probe-coupled superparamagnetic particles for each Candida target. The assembled pack is then inserted in the T2Dx instrument, which executes all steps after specimen loading.

Two milliliters of blood specimen are automatically transferred to the T2Dx Instrument where the red blood cells are lysed, Candida cells are concentrated and lysed, and Candida DNA is amplified. Amplification products are detected by T2MR detection using species-specific probes which are attached to the superparamagnetic particles. The assay provides an identification of Candida albicans and/or Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida glabrata and/or Candida krusei. The test does not distinguish between $C .$ . albicans and $C .$ . tropicalis. The test does not distinguish between $C .$ . glabrata and $C .$ . krusei. Results are provided within 5 hours of the initial blood draw.

# B Principle of Operation:

The T2Candida Panel and T2Dx Instrument rely on PCR amplification of conserved sequences to detect Candida species. The assay includes a single pair of pan-Candida primers that hybridize to conserved sequences within the 5.8S and 26S ribosomal RNA operon of Candida species and amplify the intervening transcribed spacer 2 sequence (ITS2) from nucleic acid released from the lysed Candida cells contained in the specimen. The primers are mixed in a ratio such that an asymmetric product produces a predominantly single stranded nucleic acid after amplification. The primers are designed to also amplify the internal control. Speciesspecific and internal control-specific probes provide the specificity of the assay.

The instrument detects the amplified PCR product directly in the whole blood matrix by amplicon-induced agglomeration of superparamagnetic particles attached to the species-specific and internal control-specific probes. The detection method measures the spin-spin relaxation signals of water molecules. For these measurements, the T2Dx Instrument utilizes a small permanent magnet and a specialized radio frequency coil to measure the T2MR signal from the water molecules. T2MR measures the disorder of the nuclear spins of the water molecules

contained in the sample and this disorder is directly proportional to the superparamagnetic particle clustering state. The T2Dx Instrument reports a positive or negative result for each detection channel: C. albicans/C. tropicalis (A/T), C. parapsilosis (P), C. krusei/ C. glabrata (K/G) and internal control (IC).

# VI Standards/Guidance Documents Referenced:

ISO 15223-1 Fourth Edition 2021-07: Medical devices - Symbols to be used with information to be supplied by the manufacturer - Part 1: General requirements.

Premarket Assessment of Pediatric Medical Devices: Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff (March 24, 2014)

# A Analytical Performance:

Most analytical performance metrics of the T2Candida 1.1 Panel were previously established in DEN140019 and K173536 and remain applicable under the expanded use with pediatric subjects. The sample matrix (human blood), device design, and sample workflow remain unchanged. In this submission, additional analytical studies were conducted as deemed necessary to ensure safety and effectiveness in this specific patient population. This approach is in accordance with the Premarket Assessment of Pediatric Medical Devices Guidance (2014).

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

Device precision/reproducibility was assessed and deemed acceptable in DEN140019. Refer to the DEN140019 Decision Summary for additional details.

2. Linearity: Not applicable.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Analytical Specificity

Cross-reactivity was previously assessed with 80 non-target, clinically relevant or environmental organisms in DEN140019 and select species were found to be cross-reactive (see DEN140019 Decision Summary).

Additional cross-reactivity testing was performed in this submission using five organisms clinically relevant to pediatric populations: Streptococcus agalactiae, Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus mitis, and Neisseria meningitidis.

Isolates were tested in triplicate at a concentration of $1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ . Any organism that demonstrated cross-reactivity or gave an invalid result was further evaluated with additional replicates from two additional sample preparations at the same concentration and was tested at lower, more clinically relevant concentrations of organisms in blood (100-1000 CFU/mL).

Cross-reactivity was defined as an increase in the T2 signal above the established cutoff for the Candida detection channel when tested at clinically relevant concentrations. Crossreactivity required both amplification of the organism with the pan-Candida primers and subsequent detection with any of the capture probes. Of the five organisms tested, two demonstrated cross-reactivity at $1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ (S. agalactiae, H. influenzae). Cross-reactivity was not observed when the organisms were re-tested at $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { C F U / m L }$ . The remaining three organisms did not demonstrate cross-reactivity (Table 1). The data are acceptable.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device: Not applicable. See Clinical Studies below.

2. Matrix Comparison:

Not applicable.

# C Clinical Studies:

Clinical study data from DEN140019 as well as additional data from studies that used the T2Candida 1.1 Panel with pediatric subjects were leveraged to support clinical performance of the device in subjects inclusive of adult and pediatric ages. This approach was based on the principles in the FDA Guidance, Premarket Assessment of Pediatric Medical Devices. As the course of the disease (invasive candidemia) is similar in adult and pediatric patients and the sample workflow and technological characteristics of the device remain unchanged, the amended labeling was supported by the existing clinical validation data conducted with adults.

The following principles were considered and deemed acceptably similar between the predicate device, as previously established for adult patients, and the subject device for a broader agerange subject population:

• Biological similarity of the sample (human whole blood) Biological similarity of disease in patient sub-populations No changes to device technology, design, reagents, or sample workflow

To further support testing in a pediatric population, data were evaluated from two studies from peer-reviewed literature in which the T2Candida 1.1 Panel was used to test samples from pediatric subjects. Detailed enrollment criteria, clinical protocols, patient demographic and clinical information, testing protocols, and detailed line data were provided for assessment. All samples were tested in accordance with the T2Candida 1.1 Panel instructions for use and compared to speciated Candida results from blood culture. A total of 246 samples were evaluated from patients aged $< 1$ year to 17 years. Low prevalence (as determined by positive blood culture) was observed $( 1 . 2 \% )$ . For all samples, estimates of sensitivity (PPA) ranged from $50 \mathrm { - } 1 0 0 \%$ and specificity (NPA) ranged from $9 7 { - } 9 9 \%$ . The totality of data from pediatric and adult subjects support testing with the expanded patient age population.
