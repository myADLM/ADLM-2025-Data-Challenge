# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The Nano-Check RSV Test is an immunochromatographic lateral flow assay for detection of extracted RSV nucleoprotein antigens in human anterior nasal swab specimens. To initiate testing, a flocked swab is used to collect anterior nasal swab specimens from both nostrils. The patient swab sample is placed into a Reagent Tube containing extraction buffer. The buffer disrupts the virus particles present in the sample, exposing the internal viral nucleoproteins. The test device is comprised of a plastic cassette containing the test strip and the sample well (Figure 1). After the extraction step, the sample is dispensed into the sample well of the test device.

The sample will migrate up the test strip via capillary action. If RSV nucleoprotein antigens are present, they will bind to the colloidal gold particles coupled with monoclonal antibodies specifically targeting the RSV nucleoprotein antigen. The antigen-conjugate immunocomplexes migrate across the test strip and are captured at the test line (T) of the nitrocellulose membrane forming a visible pinkish-red line. Sample continues to flow through the test device which also contains a procedural control line (C) to assess adequate sample flow and functioning of the test device. A visible pinkish-red line at the control line (C) should always appear if the assay is performed correctly. If no visible signal appears on (C) line, the test result is invalid, and this sample should be tested again with another test cassette. Test results are read 15 minutes after the sample is added to the cassette.

The Nano-Check RSV Test kit contains reagents sufficient to run 20 tests and includes:

20 Test devices in sealed aluminum foil pouch with desiccant 20 Reagent tubes prefilled with $3 5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ extraction buffer containing buffer with detergents, antibiotics and sodium azide 20 Dropper tips 20 Individually packed sterile nasal swabs   
• One Positive Control swab   
• One Negative Control swab   
• One Instructions for Use (IFU)   
• One Quick Reference Instructions (QRI)

External positive control and negative control swabs are provided with each kit of Nano-Check RSV Antigen Tests and are intended to be used as quality control samples to confirm that the reagents are functional and the assay procedure is performed correctly.

# B Principle of Operation:

The Nano-Check RSV Test employs lateral flow technology in a sandwich design to detect nucleoprotein antigens from RSV in anterior nasal samples. Following sample collection, the swab is placed in the reagent tube containing extraction buffer to lyse the sample and release viral nucleoproteins. After lysis, two drops of the sample are loaded into the test cassette sample well. The sample migrates across a pad containing colloidal gold-labelled monoclonal antibodies to RSV nucleoprotein antigen. If RSV nucleoprotein antigens are present, they will bind to the colloidal gold particles coupled with monoclonal antibodies specifically targeting the RSV nucleoprotein antigen. The antigen-conjugate immunocomplexes migrate across the test strip and are captured at the Test Line (T) of the nitrocellulose membrane forming a visible pinkish-red line. Sample continues to flow through the test device which also contains a procedural Control Line (C). A visible pinkish-red line at the Control Line should always appear if the assay is performed correctly to verify proper liquid flow and capturing of gold particles in the test device.

Test results are read 15 minutes after the sample is added to the cassette. A pink-red line at the Test Line and a pink-red line at the Control Line indicate a positive sample. A pink-red line at the Control Line only indicates a negative sample. Any test without a visible line at the Control Line should be interpreted as invalid and testing should be repeated with a new device.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

# a) Within Laboratory Precision

A precision study was conducted at one internal site, with two operators testing samples twice daily over 12 days. Test samples were contrived in negative nasal clinical matrix (NCM), spiked with RSV A Long strain to target concentrations. Four panel members were prepared: true negative (NCM, unspiked), high negative (0.1x LoD), low positive (1x LoD), and moderate positive (3x LoD). The test samples were prepared by coating the viral solutions onto the swabs. The samples were randomized and blind-coded. Each operator tested two replicates of each sample in each run (two runs per day), for a total of 96 replicates per panel member. Results are summarized below and in Table 1:

# b) Reproducibility

Another study was conducted to evaluate the reproducibility of the Nano-Check RSV Test at three external CLIA-waived sites with a total of seven untrained operators. Samples were also tested at one internal site with three trained operators. A total of three lots of test devices were used. Operators tested a randomized blind-coded panel of contrived samples at four concentration levels (prepared in the same manner as above for the precision study), with three replicates per level tested by each operator over five days. Per concentration level, 150 replicates were tested (10 operators x 5 days of testing x 3 replicates per day) for a total of 600 results. No invalid test results were obtained during the study. The results, stratified by site, are summarized below in Table 2. No significant differences between sites, or between trained and untrained operators were observed.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

# a) Cross-Reactivity and Microbial Interference Study

Cross-reactivity and potential microbial interference were evaluated by testing various bacteria, viruses and fungi with the Nano-Check RSV Test. Each organism was tested in three replicates in the absence and presence of $3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD RSV in pooled negative clinical nasal matrix using one lot of the kit reagents. The testing concentrations for potentially interfering microorganisms were ${ \geq } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ units/mL for viruses and ${ \geq } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ units/mL for other microorganisms, unless otherwise noted in the table below. None of the evaluated organisms demonstrated cross-reactivity or interference with the assay at the tested concentrations. Results are summarized in Table 3 below.

4. Assay Reportable Range:

Not Applicable

# a) Internal Controls

The Nano-Check RSV Test has a built-in internal procedural control which monitors that sufficient volume of the sample is added and the reagent flow across the membrane occurred. Formation of a pinkish-red line in the control region on the strip confirms proper sample application and that the reagents are functioning appropriately. If no visible signal appears on the control line, the test result is invalid, and the operator is instructed in the labelling to test the sample again with another test device.

# b) External Controls

The Nano-Check RSV Test kit contains one positive external control swab and one negative external control swab that allows for monitoring of the performance of the assay. The positive control swab contains noninfectious RSV antigen and the negative control swab contains noninfectious nasal clinical matrix.

Lot-to-lot precision of the external positive and negative control swabs was evaluated by testing ten replicates each of three lots of the external controls. For each external control lot, all positive and negative controls produced $100 \%$ agreement with the expected results, as summarized in Table 5 below.

# c) Specimen Stability

Specimen stability was assessed using a negative sample (consisting of pooled negative human nasal fluid) and a contrived low positive sample (containing RSV A Long strain at $2 \mathrm { x } \mathrm { L o D }$ in the pooled negative human nasal fluid). Contrived samples on the swabs were stored at ambient temperature $( 2 3 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ , high room temperature $( 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ , refrigerated (2- $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and frozen conditions $\left( - 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \right)$ before extraction and tested at 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 and 48 hours. Five replicates of each concentration were tested in accordance with the package insert at each timepoint for each condition. The results obtained in this study are summarized below.

The results showed that the nasal swab samples were stable for up 48 hours under all temperature conditions, ranging from ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . These results support the specimen stability claim of one hour after collection of the nasal swab when kept at room temperature ( $1 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ), or within 24 hours when stored refrigerated ( $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ).

# 6. Detection Limit:

The Limit of Detection (LoD) of Nano-Check RSV Test was established for four RSV strains. Contrived samples were prepared by spiking the two RSV A and two RSV B strains into pooled negative nasal fluid confirmed negative for RSV. Initially 10-fold serial dilutions of RSV strains in pooled negative nasal fluid were prepared and tested in triplicate to find the lowest level detectable by the Nano-Check RSV Test. Further characterization was performed using closely spaced 2-fold dilutions of RSV strains. The final LoD, a concentration producing $9 5 \%$ positivity, was confirmed by testing thirty replicates of RSV strains at the selected preliminary LoD.

# 7. High-dose Hook Effect Study

A high-dose hook effect study was conducted to determine if a Hook Effect would be observed at high analyte concentration (i.e., a false negative at high concentrations of RSV). Four different RSV strains (RSV A Long, RSV A2, RSV B 18537 and RSV B1) were diluted to four or five different concentrations (see Table 8 below) in pooled negative nasal fluid matrix and tested in three replicates on Nano-Check RSV Test. Concentrations ranged from $1 0 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { x }$ LoD (the maximum virus concentration possible, undiluted from the viral stock) to 1x LoD diluted in negative clinical matrix. All tested samples demonstrated $100 \%$ positivity, as expected (Table 8). The Nano-Check RSV Test did not display a Hook Effect for the tested RSV concentrations.

# 8. Inclusivity (Analytical Reactivity)

An inclusivity study was performed to demonstrate that the Nano-Check RSV Test can detect a broad range of RSV strains. In addition to the strains evaluated in the LoD study, seven strains of RSV A and two strains of RSV B were included in the study. Ten-fold dilutions of virus stocks were prepared in pooled negative nasal fluid matrix and 50 tested in five replicates in this study. The lowest concentration of each strain that resulted in $100 \%$ detection (5/5) is presented in the table below.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

Refer to Clinical Studies section below.

The sponsor conducted a matrix equivalency study between clinical anterior nasal fluid and a representative negative clinical matrix (nasal wash). Clinical nasal wash was used in some analytical studies (reproducibility/precision, cross-reactivity, interference, and reagent/kit storage). Equivalence was evaluated using one strain each for RSV A (Long strain) and RSV B (B1 strain). Virus cultures were diluted into the matrices at three concentrations: 0.1x LoD, 1x LoD and 3x LoD and tested with 10 replicates for $3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD and $0 . 3 \mathbf { x }$ LoD and 20 replicates for 1x LoD. Negativity of each of the matrices was determined by testing five replicates of each of the matrices. The results obtained in this study are summarized below. The data demonstrated equivalent performance of the test with all the three matrices.

# C Clinical Studies:

# 1. Clinical Sensitivity:

The performance of the Nano-Check RSV Test in detecting RSV nucleoprotein antigen was evaluated in a multi-center, prospective study across six geographically diverse CLIAwaived sites testing sites using anterior nasal (AN) swab samples collected from patients with signs and symptoms consistent with respiratory tract infection. The study was conducted between November 2023 to March 2024. Informed consent was obtained for all patients prior to testing. Two AN swabs were collected sequentially from each subject. The first swab (for comparator testing) was collected by the study operator from both sides of the nose and placed into transport media for comparator testing. The second swab was collected by the study operator from both sides of the nose and tested immediately with the Nano-Check RSV Test at the site. The performance of the Nano-Check RSV Test with AN swabs was estimated based on the comparison with results obtained with an FDA cleared molecular test for RSV (positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA)).

A total of 886 patients were enrolled in the clinical study of which 68 were excluded due to protocol deviations, leaving 818 specimens to be included in the calculations of estimates of assay performance. Specimens were collected from pediatric patients between 6 months to 6 years of age and adult patients 60 years or older. Of those, $2 9 \%$ (237/818) were from subjects 6 months to 2 years old, $3 6 . 9 \%$ (302/818) were from patients 2 to 6 years of age and $3 4 . 1 \%$ (279/818) were from patients 60 years or older. There were $5 2 . 4 \%$ (429/818) females and $4 7 . 6 \%$ (389/818) males.

The clinical performance of the Nano-Check RSV Test, expressed as PPA and NPA with the comparator result, testing AN swab specimens from patients with symptoms of respiratory tract infection, is shown in Table 11 below.

2. Clinical Specificity:

See section “Clinical sensitivity” above, including test specificity/negative percent agreement (NPA). The NPA for the test is $9 9 . 6 \%$ (704/707; $9 5 \%$ CI: $9 8 . 8 \% - 9 9 . 9 \% )$ .

# D Clinical Cut-Off:

The Clinical Cut-off study is not applicable, as there is no clinical cutoff related to the presence of RSV in patient samples.

# E Expected Values/Reference Range:

The rate of positivity as determined by the Nano-Check RSV Test during the 2023-2024 clinical study was $1 1 . 7 \%$ (96/818).
