# II Submission/Device Overview:

# A Purpose for Submission:

The purpose of this submission is to expand the intended use of cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative for use on the cobas 5800/6800/8800 Systems, which was originally FDA-cleared under K231306 to include asymptomatic population.

B Measurand: SARS-CoV-2 RNA

C Type of Test: Real-time nucleic acid amplification test

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative for use on the cobas 5800/6800/8800 Systems is a real-time RTPCR test intended for the qualitative detection of nucleic acids from SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from individuals with signs and symptoms of COVID19 and in anterior nasal swab specimens collected from any individuals with or without signs and symptoms of COVID-19.

Positive results are indicative of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other pathogens.

Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis for patient management decisions. Results are meant to be used in conjunction with clinical observations, patient history, recent exposures, epidemiological information, and laboratory data, in accordance with the guidelines provided by the relevant public health authorities.

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Rx - For Prescription Use Only

IVD - For in vitro diagnostic use

D Special Instrument Requirements: For use with the cobas 5800/6800/8800 Systems.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative for use on the cobas 5800/6800/8800 Systems is a fully automated test system including sample preparation (nucleic acid extraction and purification) followed by PCR amplification and detection. The cobas 5800/6800/8800 Systems consists of three separate instruments, the cobas 5800 System, the cobas 6800 System and the cobas 8800 System, which allow users to perform multiple PCR-based in vitro nucleic acid amplification tests. The cobas 5800/6800/8800 Systems consist of the sample supply module, the transfer module, the processing module, and the analytic module. Automated data management is performed by the cobas 5800/6800/8800 Systems software(s), which assigns test results for all tests. Results can be reviewed directly on the system screen and printed as a report.

Nucleic acid from patient samples and added internal control RNA (RNA IC) molecules are simultaneously extracted. Nucleic acid is released by addition of proteinase and lysis reagent to the sample. The released nucleic acid binds to the silica surface of the added magnetic glass particles. Unbound substances and impurities, such as denatured protein, cellular debris, and potential PCR inhibitors, are removed with subsequent wash steps and purified nucleic acid is eluted from the magnetic glass particles with elution buffer at elevated temperature. External controls (positive and negative) are processed in the same way.

Selective amplification of target nucleic acid from the sample is achieved using target specific forward and reverse primers for ORF1 a/b non-structural region that is unique to SARS- CoV-2. Additionally, a conserved region in the structural protein envelope E-gene were chosen for panSarbecovirus detection. The pan-Sarbecovirus detection sets will also detect SARS-CoV- 2 virus. Selective amplification of RNA IC is achieved using non-competitive sequence specific forward and reverse primers which have no homology with the coronavirus genome. A thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme is used for amplification. For more details, refer to K213804 and K231306.

B Principle of Operation: Same as K213804 and K231306

# C Clinical Studies:

Symptomatic Population   
The clinical performance of cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative in symptomatic population using anterior nasal swab and nasopharyngeal swab specimens was previously reviewed and described in K213804.

# Asymptomatic Population

The clinical performance of the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative with asymptomatic subjects was assessed using real-world data (RWD) from the National Football League (NFL) COVID-19 Surveillance Program and a prospective clinical study called Test Us at Home (TUAH).

# Real-World evidence (NFL surveillance program)

The clinical performance of the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative with asymptomatic subjects was assessed using real-world data collected from the 2020 National Football League (NFL) COVID19 Surveillance Program where samples were collected and tested between August 2020-January 2021 as part of an Occupational Testing protocol. Anterior nasal swab samples were prospectively collected on a near-daily basis from NFL players and staff.

The performance of cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative were estimated using comparator algorithm that was based on molecular comparator test results and/or clinical adjudication performed within the NFL testing program. A total of 1776 samples were selected for analysis where the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative candidate test, and comparator test results, were evaluable to establish the COVID-19 status for each sample. The results are shown below.

# Clinical Study

The clinical performance of the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative with asymptomatic subjects was also assessed using data collected from the 2021 Test Us at Home (TUAH) study where samples were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 between October 2021 and April 2022 as part of a longitudinal study. Anterior nasal swab samples were prospectively collected every 48 hours from each participant over 15 days.

The performance of cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative was estimated using a comparator algorithm where two consecutive test results (molecular test) over 48 hours were used to determine comparator result. All samples (38,185) from the TUAH study that had a valid comparator algorithm and a valid candidate test result were included in the calculation of performance estimates of the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative. The results are shown in table below.
