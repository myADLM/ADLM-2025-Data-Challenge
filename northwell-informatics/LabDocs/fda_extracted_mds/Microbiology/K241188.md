Device Name Acucy Influenza A&B Test with the Acucy 2 System

Indications for Use (Describe)

The Acucy Influenza A&B Test is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A and B viral nucleoprotein antigens directly from anterior nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The test is intended for use with the Acucy or Acucy 2 Reader as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza A and B viral infections. The test is not intended for the detection of influenza C viruses. Negative test results are presumptive and should be confirmed by viral culture or an FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay. Negative test results do not preclude influenza viral infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.

Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2017-2018 influenza season when influenza A/H3N2 and A/H1N1pdm09 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

Acucy Influenza A&B Test with the Acucy System (K182001)

# 510(k) Summary (K231187) Acucy Influenza A&B Test with the Acucy 2 System

# 1. Device Description

The Acucy Influenza A&B Test allows for the differential detection of influenza A and influenza B antigens, when used with the Acucy 2 Reader. The patient sample is placed in the Extraction Buffer vial, during which time the virus particles in the sample are disrupted, exposing internal viral nucleoproteins. After disruption, the sample is dispensed into the Test Cassette sample well. From the sample well, the sample migrates along the membrane surface. If influenza A or B viral antigens are present, they will form a complex with mouse monoclonal antibodies to influenza A and/or B nucleoproteins conjugated to colloidal gold. The complex will then be bound by a rat anti-influenza A and/or mouse anti-influenza B antibody coated on the nitrocellulose membrane.

Depending upon the operator’s choice, the Test Cassette is either placed inside the Acucy 2 Reader for automatically timed development mode (WALK AWAY Mode) or placed on the counter or bench top for a manually timed development and then placed into Acucy 2 Reader to be scanned (READ NOW Mode).

The Acucy 2 Reader will scan the Test Cassette and measure the absorbance intensity by processing the results using method-specific algorithms. The Acucy 2 Reader will display the test results POS $( + )$ , NEG (-), or INVALID on the screen. The results can also be automatically printed on the optional Printer if this option is selected.

# 2. Device Intended Use

The Acucy Influenza A&B Test is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A and B viral nucleoprotein antigens directly from anterior nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The test is intended for use with the Acucy or Acucy 2 Reader as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza A and B viral infections. The test is not intended for the detection of influenza C viruses. Negative test results are presumptive and should be confirmed by viral culture or an FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay. Negative test results do not preclude influenza viral infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.

510(k) Summary (K231187)

Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2017-2018 influenza season when influenza A/H3N2 and A/H1N1pdm09 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.

If an infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL $^ { 3 + }$ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

# 4.1 Analytical Performance

# Precision Study Summary

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the consistency of performance of the Acucy 2 reader when using the Acucy Influenza A&B Test as part of the Acucy 2 System. The studies were designed to assess Within-Laboratory Repeatability over multiple days and Instrumentto-Instrument Variability.

On each day of testing, contrived positive samples at $0 . 9 5 \times$ (Low Positive), 2x LoD (Moderate positive), and $0 . 0 5 \times$ LoD (High negative) were prepared. Contrived swabs were prepared by adding $5 0 \mu \iota$ of sample to head of swab. Negative samples were prepared by adding $5 0 \mu \iota$ of sample to the head of swab. Swabs were dried for 1 minute. All further testing is performed as per Acucy Influenza A&B Instructions for Use (IFU, PN 3248).

# 4.2 Test Mode Equivalency

The purpose of this study was to qualify the two available test modes of the Acucy 2 System (READ NOW and WALK AWAY) and confirm that they function equivalently. The study was performed by testing twenty (20) replicates each of contrived positive Flu A and Flu B at a concentration of 2x LoD and twenty (20) Flu A and Flu B negative samples (matrix alone) using two (2) Acucy 2 Readers at the same time. One reader was in WALK AWAY mode, and the other in READ NOW mode. One (1) lot of Acucy Influenza A&B kits were used for testing. All testing was done with Influenza A/Michigan and Influenza B/Colorado. On each day of testing, contrived positive samples at 2x LoD (Moderate positive), were prepared by dilution in clinical matrix.

Contrived swabs were prepared by adding $5 0 \mu \ L$ of sample (either contrived positive or negative) to the head of swab. Swabs were dried for 1 minute. All further testing was performed as per Acucy Influenza A&B Instructions for Use (IFU, PN 3248). All tests showed the expected results, positives read as positives in both modes and negatives read as negatives whether in the READ NOW or WALK AWAY mode. The two available test modes function equivalently. The results of the testing are shown in Table 4.

# 4.3 Limit of Detection (LoD)

A comparison of the analytical sensitivity of the Acucy and Acucy 2 readers side by side was performed in a limit of detection (LoD) experiment. For comparing the LoD, two (2) lots of Acucy Influenza A&B assay devices were tested with two (2) strains each of Influenza A (Michigan and Singapore) and two (2) strains each of Influenza B (Phuket and Colorado). A range finding experiment using 5 replicates and 10-fold dilutions of the stock was undertaken on day one (1). After determining the target dilution, for each strain serial two (2) fold dilutions were made corresponding to five low level samples around the expected LoD. These concentrations were tested over three days for a total of 20 replicates per concentration and the lowest concentration at with $\geq 9 5 \%$ of samples were positive was designated the LoD for that lot for the strain tested. Following completion of testing of all strains and both lots the lowest concentration that agrees across both lots was selected as the LoD for that strain.

Confirmation testing was done with 20 replicates once the expected LoD was established. Pooled negative clinical matrix samples were used for preparing dilutions. To create the negative clinical matrix, nasal swab samples were collected from healthy donors and confirmed Flu negative by PCR. Each Flu negative-confirmed nasal swab sample was extracted in $3 . 0 ~ \mathsf { m L }$ of NCM as per the testing that was done for AcucyTM Influenza A&B Test with the AcucyTM System (K182001). Swab extracts are combined and mixed thoroughly to create a pool of negative clinical matrix to be used as diluent. Contrived swabs in all cases were prepared by adding $5 0 \mu \iota$ of sample to head of swab and dried for one (1) minute. All further testing was performed as per Acucy Influenza A&B Instructions for Use. The results of the LoD testing are shown in Tables 5-7. The results are displayed as Positive detection rate (Number of positives/ Total tested). The LoD for all strains tested on both lots of devices were identical whether tested using Acucy or Acucy 2, confirming that the performance of the Acucy 2 is equivalent to the Acucy.

# 4.4 Analytical Cutoff Study

The purpose of this study was to establish the Limit of Blank (LoB) of the Acucy Influenza A&B Assay on the Acucy 2 System by testing sixty (60) replicates of a blank sample per lot to determine the LoB of each lot. Two different device lots were used in testing. Pooled negative clinical matrix samples were used for preparing these samples. 50 µL of contrived specimen was pipetted onto the head of a new nasal swab and dried for one (1) minute. All testing was done per the IFU.

All blank samples showed 0 mABS. In the original study on the Acucy system, the analytical cut-off values were determined to be 6.4 and 5.4 mABS for the Flu A Line and Flu B Line respectively obtained by comparing the assay thresholds of two (2) lots of Acucy Influenza A&B Assay. Acucy 2 was designed to replace Acucy and is expected to be similar to the latter. Under these circumstances the analytical cut-off for Acucy 2 has been set to match the previously established cut-off of 6.4 and 5.4 mABS for Flu A Line and Flu B Line respectively.

# 4.5 Cross Contamination Study

The purpose of this study was to evaluate if there is any target carryover between test cassettes leading to cross-contamination between samples when testing the Acucy Influenza A&B test on the Acucy 2 system. The cross-contamination study was evaluated by alternately testing samples at a high titer $1 . 0 \times 1 0 5 \ : \mathrm { T C | D 5 0 / m l ) }$ and negative samples. This study used one (1) strain of Influenza A and one (1) strain of Influenza B for high titer positive samples and tested on one (1) lot of the Acucy Influenza A&B Test with Acucy 2 System. 120 samples were tested in all, 60 negatives and 30 each of Flu A and Flu B samples. Sample dilutions were prepared. Contrived swabs were prepared by adding $5 0 \mu \iota$ of sample to head of swab. Negative samples were prepared by adding $5 0 \mu \iota$ of negative clinical matrix to the head of a swab. Swabs were dried for 1 minute. All further testing is performed as per Acucy Influenza A&B Instructions for Use (IFU, PN 3248). All testing was done with Influenza A Michigan and Influenza B Colorado. All tests showed expected results as shown in Table 8, positives read as positives and negatives read as negatives.

# 4.6 Method Comparison - Acucy Reader vs. Acucy 2 Reader

A comparison study was conducted to establish performance equivalence between the Acucy and Acucy 2 Readers. Thirty (30) samples each of PCR confirmed Flu A positive and Flu B positive clinical samples and thirty (30) Flu A and Flu B negative clinical samples were tested using one (1) Acucy Reader and one (1) Acucy 2 Reader with one (1) lot of Acucy Influenza A&B test kits. The Flu A positive samples were considered negatives for Flu B, and those positive for Flu B were considered negative for Flu A. Together, including double negative samples, there were a total of 60 negatives for each group. These samples were representative of a range of virus levels with RT-PCR values ranging from Ct 11.5 - 32.4.

# 5. CLIA Waiver Studies

# 5.1 Flex Studies

These studies were carried out to characterize operator workflow and usability risks identified with use of the Acucy Influenza A&B test on the Acucy 2 System by simulating conditions where the test was performed outside the intended use instructions and environment and the Acucy 2 Reader differed from the Acucy Reader. Each flex study was conducted using sample panel (Negative, Low Positive (2x LoD) Flu A, and Low Positive (2x LoD) Flu B) tested in five (5) replicates for every flex condition using one (1) lot of Acucy Influenza A&B kit.

# 510(k) Summary (K231187) Acucy Influenza A&B Test with the Acucy 2 System

The following flex studies were performed:

• Temperature and Humidity   
• Vibrations from surrounding instruments   
• Environmental lighting   
• Air Draft conditions   
• Operational altitude/barometric pressure   
• Non-level reader position   
• Contamination of Cassette Read Window   
• Movement of Acucy 2 Reader in WALK AWAY mode   
• Movement of test cassette and vertical incubation   
• Positioning of Acucy test in reader drawer

Based on the results of the flex testing, all the hazards and sources of potential error have been controlled to reasonably acceptable levels through design features and appropriate labelling mitigations.

# 5.2 Reproducibility

The reproducibility of the Acucy Influenza A&B Test was evaluated on the Acucy Reader in testing performed at three point-of-care (POC) sites. A panel of swabs including negative (no virus), high negative (below the limit of detection), low positive (at or near the limit of detection) and moderate positive (at or near 2x the limit of detection) for influenza A and B were coded, randomized, and masked to the operators. The study was conducted with two operators per site over five non-consecutive days. As seen in the table below, the Acucy Influenza A&B Test produces reproducible results when tested by multiple intended users, at multiple sites, over multiple days.

# Supplementary Reproducibility Study

The reproducibility of the Acucy Influenza A&B Test was evaluated on the Acucy 2 Reader in testing performed at three laboratory sites. A panel of swabs including negative (no virus), high negative (below the limit of detection), low positive (at or near the limit of detection) and moderate positive (at or near 2x the limit of detection) for influenza A and B were coded, randomized, and masked to the operators. The study was conducted with two operators per site over five non-consecutive days. As seen in the tables below, the Acucy Influenza A&B Test produces reproducible results when tested by multiple intended users, at multiple sites, over multiple days.
