# II Submission/Device Overview:

# A Purpose for Submission:

To expand the Intended Use of the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay, which was FDA-cleared under K222736, to include testing of anterior nasal swab (ANS) specimens that have been eluted into UTM/VTM. Additionally, to introduce an Adaptive Crosstalk Correction (ACC) factor in the Assay Definition Module (ADM) software to eliminate potential under correction of crosstalk between the SARS-CoV-2 channel (ROX) and the Flu B channel (RED674) that in some cases produced false Flu B positive results for samples that were SARS-CoV-2 positive, at high titers.

# B Measurand:

The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay detects SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens and anterior nasal swab (ANS) specimens from individuals with signs and symptoms of a respiratory tract infection.

# C Type of Test:

This assay is a multiplexed nucleic acid test that detects and differentiates SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and RSV through nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and detection using real-time RT-PCR. All steps of the assay are automated, after the manual addition of sample into the sample lysis tube (SLT) and performed within the Panther and Panther Fusion system.

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay is a fully automated multiplexed real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in vitro diagnostic test intended for the qualitative detection and differentiation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza A virus (Flu A), influenza B virus (Flu B), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Nucleic acids are isolated and purified from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens and anterior nasal (AN) swab specimens obtained from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of a respiratory tract infection. Clinical signs and symptoms of respiratory viral infection due to SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV can be similar. This assay is intended to aid in the differential diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B, and RSV infections in humans and is not intended to detect influenza C virus infections.

Nucleic acids from the viral organisms identified by this test are generally detectable in NP and AN swab specimens during the acute phase of infection. The detection and identification of specific viral nucleic acids from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection are indicative of the presence of the identified virus and aids in diagnosis if used in conjunction with other clinical and epidemiological information, and laboratory findings. The results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decisions.

Positive results do not rule out coinfection with other organisms. The organism(s) detected by the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay may not be the definite cause of disease. Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, or RSV infections. This assay is designed for use on the Panther Fusion system.

The Hologic RespDirect Collection Kit is cleared for NP swab specimens only for testing with the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay.

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Rx - For Prescription Use Only For in vitro diagnostic use only D Special Instrument Requirements: For use with the Panther Fusion System, only

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay is a multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) in vitro diagnostic test developed for use on the fully automated Panther Fusion system to detect and differentiate SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) directly from nasopharyngeal or anterior nasal swab specimens.

The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay cartridge contains the same sample preparation and PCR reaction chemistry as the previously cleared Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV assay (K171963). To accommodate addition of the SARS-CoV-2 reagents (primers/probes) to the multiplexed reagents, minor changes were made to the previously cleared analyte primer/probe concentrations and RFU cutoffs. Additionally, the fluorophore for Flu B was changed from ROX to RED647 to accommodate the addition of SARS-CoV-2 to the assay.

The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay involves the following steps:

a. Sample lysis - Prior to processing and testing on the Panther Fusion system, specimens are transferred to a Specimen Lysis Tube (SLT) containing specimen transport media (STM). Alternatively, samples can be collected with the RespDirect Collection kit which contains enhanced specimen transport media (eSTM). STM and eSTM lyse the cells, release target nucleic acid and protect them from degradation during storage.

b. Nucleic acid capture and elution - These steps take place in a single tube on the Panther Fusion system. The eluate is transferred to the Panther Fusion system reaction tube containing the assay reagents. The Internal Control-S (IC-S) is added to each test specimen and controls via the working Panther Fusion Capture Reagent-S (wFCR-S). The IC-S in the reagent is used to monitor specimen processing, amplification, and detection. Magnetic particles with covalently bound oligonucleotides mediate the nucleic acid capture. Capture oligonucleotides hybridize to total nucleic acid in the test specimen. Hybridized nucleic acid is then separated from the lysed specimen in a magnetic field. Wash and aspiration steps remove extraneous components debris from the reaction tube. The elution step elutes purified nucleic acid.

c. Elution transfer and multiplex RT-PCR - Eluted nucleic acid is transferred to a Panther Fusion reaction tube already containing oil and reconstituted master mix. A reverse transcriptase generates a DNA copy of the target sequence. Target specific forward and reverse primers and probes then amplify targets while simultaneously detecting and discriminating multiple target types via multiplex RT-PCR. The Panther Fusion system compares the fluorescence signal to a predetermined cut-off to produce a qualitative result for the presence or absence of the analyte. The positive result for each analyte will be accompanied by the cycle threshold (Ct value).

# Hologic RespDirect Collection Kit

An ancillary collection kit that consists of the RespDirect Swab, intended for collection of NP swab specimens, and the enhanced Direct Load Tube (eDLT), containing enhanced specimen transport media (eSTM). This transport media lyses cells, releasing target nucleic acids and protecting them from degradation during storage.

# B Principle of Operation:

The assay detects viral nucleic acids that have been extracted from a patient respiratory sample (i.e., NPS or ANS swab). A multiplex Real-time RT-PCR reaction is carried out under optimized conditions generating amplicons for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and RSV. The Internal Control-S (IC-S) is added to each test specimen before processing to act as a control for specimen processing, amplification, and detection. Identification of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, RSV, and the IC-S occurs using target-specific primers and fluorescent-labeled probes that hybridize to conserved regions in the viral genomes (Table 1).

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

Since the initial clearance of the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV Assay (K222736), an Adaptive Crosstalk Correction (ACC) factor was implemented in the Assay Definition Module (ADM) software to eliminate potential under correction of crosstalk between the SARS-CoV-2 (ROX channel) and the Flu B channel (RED674) that in some cases produced false Flu B positive results for samples that were also SARS-CoV-2 high positives. The ACC was evaluated by (1) reanalyzing all analytical and clinical study data collected in support of K222736 with the ACC, except for the Cutoff Study1 , and (2) Performing additional analytical and clinical studies with the ACC to demonstrate that the software changes are effective in eliminating the infrequent occurrence of false Flu B results in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples.

For those studies originally performed in K222736 and reanalyzed with the new ACC, there were no changes to the study conclusions using the original acceptance criteria. The results of additional analytical studies and clinical studies to support the ACC are presented below. Since there were no other modifications to the assay (e.g., test reagent formulation, etc.), it was unnecessary to repeat several of the studies performed in support of K222736. If a study was not repeated, a reference to where the results can be found (i.e., publicly available K222736 Decision Summary) has been made.

1 Data produced in the Cutoff Study were generated with single target panels/samples which are not affected by Adaptive Crosstalk Correction since cross talk only impacts results where SARS-CoV-2 and Flu B are present. Since the Cutoff Study data did not contain that condition, re-analysis was not performed.

Competitive Interference Study Performed with the Adaptive Crosstalk Correction The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the Adaptive Crosstalk Correction does not cause competitive interference in co-infected samples containing high levels of SARS-CoV-2 and low levels of Flu B. One SARS-CoV-2 strain (USA-WA1/2020, BEI NR-52281) and one Flu B strain (Victoria lineage, Washington/02/19, Zeptometrix PN:0810611CF ) were included in the evaluation. Co-infection panels were made by spiking SARS-CoV-2 at a high concentration $( 1 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathrm { m L } )$ and Flu B at a low concentration $\left( \sim 3 \mathrm { x } \ L \mathrm { o D } \right)$ in pooled negative NP swab VTM/UTM clinical matrix. Three replicates were tested with the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV2/Flu A/B/RSV Assay utilizing the ACC ADM. The results of the competitive interference study are shown in Table 2. No competitive interference was observed at the concentrations tested.

6. Detection Limit:

# Confirmation of the Flu B Limit of Detection (LoD)

This study was performed to demonstrate that the Adaptive Crosstalk Correction does not alter the established Flu B LoD. The LoD for Flu B was confirmed by testing two (2) strains of Flu B, one (1) Yamagata lineage and one (1) Victoria lineage (Table 3). These are the same strains used to establish the Flu B LoD in K222736. Samples were prepared in pooled negative NP swab VTM/UTM clinical matrix at 1x LoD, as established in K222736. Additionally, dilutions half a log above and below the established LoD were tested to confirm the LoD. Twenty-eight replicates were collected for each strain/concentration combination included in the study. The LoDs of both Flu B strains were confirmed to be the same as previously established in K222736 before the ACC was implemented. The LoD results are summarized in Table 3.

# Prospective Study to Expand the Intended Use to Include an ANS Specimen Claim

The clinical performance of the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay was established in a multi-center study conducted with two patient-matched ANS specimens that were prospectively collected (i.e., all comers between two time points who meet the inclusion criteria) from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infections during the 2022-2023 respiratory illness season. ANS specimens from nine geographically diverse clinical sites in the U.S. were enrolled and tested fresh (Category I specimens) with the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay at three U.S. testing sites.

The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay was evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 performance by comparing the candidate device testing results to a composite comparator algorithm (CCA) consisting of three highly sensitive U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests. A final CCA result was assigned when two of the three composite comparator assays were in concordance. The comparator method utilized to establish performance for the Flu A, Flu B, and RSV targets was a U.S. FDA-cleared molecular Flu A/B/RSV assay. All comparator testing was performed in accordance with the respective package inserts at one central laboratory.

A total of 1268 subjects (each providing two ANS specimens) were acquired and enrolled for the prospective clinical study. Of these 1268 subjects, two were withdrawn because they did not meet the study eligibility criteria, leaving 1266 subjects. Of these 1266 subjects, 77 had their ANS specimens excluded because they were received outside the candidate assay sample stability period, did not have a valid SARS-CoV-2 CCA or Flu A/Flu B/RSV comparator result, or had an invalid candidate device result upon retesting per the Instructions for Use. This left 1189 ANS specimens with evaluable results for SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B, and RSV.

Of the 1268 subjects enrolled in the study, 1230 had their ANS specimens tested with the candidate device. Ten (10) of these specimens were invalid by the candidate device during testing, for an initial invalid rate of $0 . 8 \%$ (10/1230). Upon retesting, the invalid rate decreased to $0 . 3 \%$ (4/1230).

Table 4 provides a summary of demographic information for the 1189 evaluable specimens included in the prospective clinical study.

A summary of the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay prospective clinical study performance is provided in Table 5.

Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) was calculated as $1 0 0 \% \times \left( \mathrm { T P } / \left( \mathrm { T P } + \mathrm { F N } \right) \right)$ . True positive (TP) indicates that both the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay and the comparator method had a positive result for the specific analyte, and false negative (FN) indicates that the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV was negative while the comparator result was positive. Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) was calculated as $1 0 0 \% \times \mathrm { ( T N / ( T N + F P ) ) }$ . True negative (TN) indicates that both the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay and the comparator method had negative results, and false positive (FP) indicates that the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay was positive while the comparator result was negative. Specimens that obtained discordant results underwent additional testing with a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV molecular test, when sufficient sample volume remained.

# Retrospective Clinical Study with ANS Specimens

Flu B and RSV were of lower prevalence and were not encountered in sufficiently large numbers during the prospective clinical study to adequately demonstrate assay performance with ANS specimens. To supplement the results of the prospective clinical study, an evaluation of 175 preselected, archived retrospective specimens was performed. These specimens were archived ANS in VTM or UTM that were collected between November 2022 and June 2023. Specimens were selected for enrollment in the study based solely on the historic qualitative result. In addition to evaluating Flu B and RSV positive specimens, Flu A positive specimens were included in the study. Of the 175 specimens, 2 were not included in performance calculations because they had invalid comparator results, leaving 173 specimens. The 173 remaining specimens were

distributed uniformly across two clinical testing sites. A summary of the demographic information for the ANS retrospective specimens is provided in Table 8.

# Retrospective Clinical Study Conducted with SARS-CoV-2 Positive Clinical Specimens to Evaluate the Adaptive Crosstalk Correction

To demonstrate that the Adaptive Crosstalk Correction can resolve unexpected Flu B positives in the presence of SARS-CoV-2, ten individual SARS-CoV-2 high positive archived NP swab clinical specimens (in VTM/UTM) were evaluated with the original ADF (K222736) and the modified ADF containing the ACC. Each specimen was tested once with each ADF. The results are summarized in Table 11. All ten specimens produced Flu B positive results when tested with the original ADF (without the ACC). Upon testing with the new ADF containing the ACC, all Flu B positive results were resolved (i.e., all specimens yielded Flu B negative results), demonstrating that the ACC is functioning as intended.
