Dear Joan Gordon:

We have reviewed your section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database available at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Additional information about changes that may require a new premarket notification are provided in the FDA guidance documents entitled "Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device" (https://www.fda.gov/media/99812/download) and "Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Software Change to an Existing Device" (https://www.fda.gov/media/99785/download).

Your device is also subject to, among other requirements, the Quality System (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820), which includes, but is not limited to, 21 CFR 820.30, Design controls; 21 CFR 820.90, Nonconforming product; and 21 CFR 820.100, Corrective and preventive action. Please note that regardless of whether a change requires premarket review, the QS regulation requires device manufacturers to review and approve changes to device design and production (21 CFR 820.30 and 21 CFR 820.70) and document changes and approvals in the device master record (21 CFR 820.181).

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR Part 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR Part 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safetyreporting-combination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR Part 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR Parts 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice (https://www.fda.gov/medical  
devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance) and CDRH Learn   
(https://www.fda.gov/training-and-continuing-education/cdrh-learn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic.

# Description of Modified Device (inclusion of SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel Mini and packaging change):

SPOTFIRE RSP Pos & Neg Controls, P/N M425, is a quality control panel consisting of 12 readyto-use, liquid controls, 6 of SPOTFIRE RSP Positive Control (Positive Control), P/N M42638, and 6 of SPOTFIRE RSP Negative Control (Negative Control), P/N M42738, in a single kit box, and a separate kit of 6 additional SPOTFIRE RSP Negative Controls (Negative Control), P/N M42738. The separate kit of SPOTFIRE RSP Negative Control allows and encourages the end user to check for environmental contamination by testing additional negative controls. The Positive Control contains non-infectious surrogate control material; a solution of synthetic RNA transcripts in buffer, stabilizers and preservatives. The RNA in the Positive Control carries RNA segments of all the respiratory and sore throat pathogens detected by the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Respiratory (R) Panel, BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Respiratory (R) Panel Mini, BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Respiratory/Sore Throat (R/ST) Panel, and BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Respiratory/Sore Throat (R/ST) Panel Mini assays, performed on the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System. (see Tables 1-4 below) SPOTFIRE RSP Pos & Neg Controls are specifically designed for and intended to be used solely with the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R Panel, BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R Panel Mini, BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel, and BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel Mini assays on the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System. The Negative Control contains buffer and preservatives with no RNA. Each liquid control of SPOTFIRE RSP Pos & Neg Controls is processed separately according to the SPOTFIRE Panel assay manufacturer’s Instructions for Use for patient samples (nasopharyngeal swabs or throat swabs placed in transport media) obtained from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection or pharyngitis. Engineering drawings, schematics, etc. are not applicable to the device (device is a reagent).

# Substantial Equivalence

Maine Molecular Quality Controls, Inc. (MMQCI) proposes that changes made to the labeling and packaging for SPOTFIRE RSP Pos & Neg Controls do not impact substantial equivalence to the predicate device (K233611), SPOTFIRE® RSP Pos & Neg Controls. The manufacturing processes and components used to manufacture SPOTFIRE RSP Pos & Neg Controls are the same as those of the predicate device. No changes have been made to the predicate device, other than labeling and kit box. In addition, the targets detected by the SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel Mini are included in the SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel.

# Performance Data:

Performance data presented in the predicate 510(k) submission (K233611) has all the required data to support the labeling change to the existing device to include the SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel Mini in the intended use for SPOTFIRE RSP Pos & Neg Controls, and the packaging change to combine Positive and Negative controls in a single kit box. No additional performance data are required as the SPOTFIRE RSP Pos & Neg Controls have not been changed, the assay consumables are identical for the SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel used to collect original performance data and the SPOTFIRE R Panel Mini. In addition, the targets reported in the SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel Mini are a subset of the SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel.

# Results and Conclusion:

Based upon the substantial equivalence characteristics listed in Table 5 and the original performance data (K233611), MMQCI has determined that the proposed change to the intended use (the addition of the SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel Mini assay), and the packaging to contain Positive and Negative controls in the same kit box, supports substantial equivalence to the predicate device K233611, SPOTFIRE RSP Pos & Neg Controls.
