# B Principle of Operation:

The TriVerity test is composed of the TriVerity Cartridge that is run on the Myrna Instrument. The Myrna Instrument is a cartridge-based, molecular diagnostic instrument designed to measure relative gene expression. The single-use TriVerity Cartridge contains all the necessary reagents to perform RNA isolation from the sample and analysis. The PAXgene Blood RNA Tube is directly docked to the cartridge by the user before the cartridge is loaded into the instrument. Approximately $5 5 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of blood and PAXgene solution is drawn into the cartridge from the tube. Nucleic acid extraction and purification are completed on-board using standard solid phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) chemistry facilitated by magnetic particles. Purified RNA is eluted and then mixed with master mix reagents, and then is channeled to separate reaction vessels. The Myrna Instrument’s analyzer/detector is an incubator designed for isothermal amplification with single color fluorescence detection capability. The quantitative gene expression assay is based on real-time generation of fluorescence from an intercalating dye which increases its fluorescence signal due to the increasing abundance of double stranded DNA generated during amplification. Each singleplex reaction is performed in a $2 \mu \mathrm { L }$ reaction volume.

The test simultaneously runs 64 isothermal amplification reactions. The test uses a multiplex array which contains primers to measure, in duplicate, 29 mRNA host response transcripts, 3 housekeeping transcripts, and 2 process controls. The housekeeping genes are used together with process controls to normalize input RNA, while the ‘host response genes’ are inputs to the two fixed classifiers that generate the assay results: IMX-BVN-4 (bacterial-viral-noninfected) and IMX-SEV-4 (illness severity). The IMX-BVN-4 classifier estimates of the likelihood of a bacterial or a viral infection and the IMX-SEV-4 classifier estimates the risk of severe illness as defined by the 7-day need for vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, and/or renal replacement therapy.

For each patient sample, the TriVerity test will generate three numerical results which indicate the likelihood of a bacterial infection, the likelihood of a viral infection, and the likelihood of severe illness. For each numerical result, there will also be an interpretation provided that is related to the specific risk band within which the quantitative number falls (corresponding to Very High, High, Moderate, Low, and Very Low).

The TriVerity Cartridge is designed to dock the PAXgene venipuncture tube directly to avoid potential issues (including use error, contamination, and biohazards) in transferring samples from one vessel to another. The pre-analytical steps are designed to be simple and consist of tube inversion, insertion of the tube into the cartridge, and insertion of the cartridge into the device, with an estimated hands-on time of less than one minute.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name:

Myrna Instrument

2. Specimen Identification:

The instrument software reads a unique barcode on the assay cartridge to identify the cartridge type, the cartridge assay, the cartridge lot/expiration details, and lot-to-lot correction factors. This unique cartridge barcode is linked to the sample ID through scanning or manual entry. The cartridge barcode also includes traceability information including the cartridge manufacture date and expiration dates.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

A medical professional is required for collecting the whole blood sample by venipuncture using the PAXgene blood collection tubes within the PAXgene Blood RNA System (K042613). The user then mixes the sample by inversion followed by loading the tube directly into the cartridge and then inserting the cartridge into the Myrna instrument. All waste and amplified material remain sealed within the TriVerity Cartridge after the test is performed.

4. Calibration:

All necessary configuration, qualification, and calibration (where applicable) is performed by Inflammatix including calibration of the TriVerity cartridges. Further configuration and calibration procedures are not required by the operator.

5. Quality Control:

Each cartridge contains two internal process controls for monitoring amplification inhibition, assay reagents, and sample processing effectiveness. The controls are RNA spike in controls from the External RNA Controls Consortium. External controls are not provided with the assay, but may be used in accordance with local, state, and federal accrediting organizations, as applicable.

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

A multi-site reproducibility study was performed across three laboratories. The measurements were performed over five non-consecutive days. At each site, at least two operators conducted the tests on three different instruments using one cartridge lot/panel for a total of 90 runs per panel member.

The ‘infectious’ specimens were designed as contrived specimens. The samples were formulated, aliquoted $( 1 . 6 \mathrm { m L } )$ then frozen at $- 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Prior to initiation of the reproducibility study, the aliquots were sent on dry ice to the participating laboratories. Each aliquot was thawed at room temperature for up to 120 mins or until completely thawed. After thawing, PAXgene RNA Blood contrived samples were homogenized by inverting 10 times and immediately run on the Myrna instrument. The following panel members were utilized for the reproducibility study:

Results from the reproducibility study are summarized in the table below including betweendays, instruments, and sites. Results met the pre-specified acceptance criteria of the standard deviation (SD) for the evaluated interpretation band being less than 5.50 score units, which reflects a small probability of scores falling into nonadjacent bands. The TriVerity scores are on a logistic scale and therefore CV analysis was not considered for these parameters; however, SD and $\% C V$ for the reproducibility study were included in Table 4 for the 29 host response genes and two housekeeping genes.

# 2. Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility:

To evaluate variance of the TriVerity scores between cartridge lots a lot-to-lot reproducibility study was conducted using the four panel members. Samples were tested by one operator at one site on four separate instruments using three cartridges lots. For each run, cartridge lots were alternated resulting in a total of six replicates per lot for each panel member for a total of 18 samples per panel member. Results from the lot variability study, included in Table 6 below, were acceptable and met the pre-defined acceptance criteria.

An additional study was performed to assess the TriVerity device measurements across the score ranges not fully evaluated with contrived samples during the reproducibility study. Clinical samples that covered all score types were evaluated with at least 20 results in every score band. Each sample was tested in duplicate with the same instrument and cartridge lot. The study was performed over five days using a total of three different cartridge lots and 12 different instruments. The SD measured in each band score type was less than 5.50 score units, meeting the pre-defined acceptance criteria for repeatability.

# 3. Linearity:

Linearity is not applicable to the TriVerity test score. To ensure that the markers that are used to generate the score are being detected quantitatively within the linear range a linearity study was performed for the gene expression of the individual markers. Using serial dilutions prepared with pure in vitro transcribed RNA sequences which contained each of the 32 markers measured by the TriVerity test, six dilutions, ranging from $5 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 9 }$ copies/mL to $5 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ copies $/ \mathrm { m L }$ , were prepared in an RNA stabilizing solution and measured in duplicate. The study was performed in a single laboratory, on a single day using one instrument. The data showed linearity, for the analytical measuring range of $1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 9 }$ copies $/ \mathrm { m L }$ to $1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ copies $/ \mathrm { m L }$ , and device results met the acceptance criteria of a $5 \%$ allowable deviation from linearity for each of the 32 assay markers.

# 4. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

# Analytical Specificity/Cross-reactivity

Non-specific amplification from genomic DNA $( 2 0 \mathrm { n g / \mu L }$ of gDNA added to RNA stabilization buffer) as well as from a no-template control (NTC) was evaluated. Both the NTC and the human genomic DNA showed no amplification signal. Separately, crossreactivity was assessed by spiking $1 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / \mu L }$ of gDNA into the two contrived panel members B and C then comparing the results to un-spiked samples. Results demonstrated no significant bias or imprecision when compared with control conditions at the tested concentrations. The mean drift between the control and test samples was $< 5 . 5 0$ score units and the difference in standard deviation for each results band was also $< 5 . 5 0$ score units.

# Interference

An interference study was performed to evaluate the impact of select endogenous and exogenous interferents on the ability of the assay to detect the 32 genes in the TriVerity test, specifically the impact of those substances on score results. Interferents were appropriately prepared, then spiked into each of the two panel members B (Very High Bacterial Score/Very Low Viral Score/Very High Severity Score) and C (Very Low Bacterial Score/Very High Viral Score/Very Low Severity Score), at concentrations higher than the normal or expected reference ranges. Four replicates per panel were tested at each concentration of potential interferent using two cartridge lots. Interference was assessed by estimating the bias for each specimen when compared to an un-spiked control (containing no interferent and the appropriate solvent, when applicable). The substances tested, concentration of each, and results are listed below in Table 7.

6. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods): PAXgene Sample Collection/Handling

A specimen stability study was conducted to support the recommended handling conditions from blood collection with PAXgene sample tubes to testing on the TriVerity Cartridge. Blood samples were collected from 15 healthy donors with the first sample processed within one hour of collection, then tested in duplicate after a 2-hour, 12-hour, and 14-hour incubation at room temperature ( $1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ). Results from the stability study were not statistically significant and demonstrated a standard deviation less than 5.50 score units in the TriVerity Severity score when evaluated after 12-hour or 14-hour storage compared to time 0. This acceptance criteria ensures that less than $2 . 5 \%$ of the observed scores fell into a nonadjacent reporting bin, which would change the clinical interpretation. These data support the recommended handling claims that samples can be stored at room temperature up to 12 hours after collection.

# Freeze-thaw Stability Study

To support the use of banked frozen samples in the clinical validation studies an additional study was performed to demonstrate equivalence between fresh and frozen specimens. At total of 60 whole blood specimens collected in PAXgene sample tubes were tested. Following incubation at room temperature, specimens were stored for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h r s }$ . at $- 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ then underwent one freeze thaw cycle. TriVerity results were compared to results from the same sample that was tested within one hour of collection. Across all evaluated samples, the mean Viral and Severity TriVerity score shifts were not statistically significant. The mean shift for the Bacterial score was significant; however, the shift was less than 5.50 score units. Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that a single freeze-thaw cycle did not significantly affect the TriVerity reported results.

# Real-time Stability

Real-time reagent stability studies are ongoing to support product claims of room temperature storage for 12 months. Testing will be performed on three cartridge lots when stored at $1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 18 months. Stability testing for one month demonstrated no significant change in performance for any of the three TriVerity scores.

# Shipping Stability

Shipping studies were conducted for both the TriVerity cartridges and the Myrna instrument. For the Myrna instrument, control samples were tested prior to ship testing. The instrument in its packaging was then subjected to distribution cycle 13 at assurance level II as defined in ASTM D4169:23. A second set of samples were tested and compared to the control samples. Standard deviation in Bacterial, Viral, and Severity scores of post ship test runs were $< 5 . 5 0$ score units.

Sixty (60) cartridges underwent ship testing and more than 30 cartridges were tested after conditioning and ship testing. The cartridges were pre-conditioned per ASTM F2825-18 then subjected to simulated ship testing per ASTM D4169:23, distribution cycle 13 with assurance level II. The cartridges and packaging passed all post ship test inspections. A contrived sample panel was tested. Standard deviation in Bacterial, Viral, and Severity scores of post ship test runs were $< 5 . 5 0$ score units. There was no impact on cartridge or instrument performance after testing.

# Limit of Blank

Leukoreduced blood was used to determine the Limit of Blank. Ten replicates of the leukocyte reduced blood did not generate a valid TriVerity test score for any score type.

# Limit of Detection

To determine the Limit of Detection, an RNA stabilizing solution was spiked with serial dilutions of the transcribed RNA IVT mix. From testing 20 replicates of concentrations ranging from $1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ copies/mL to $1 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ copies $/ \mathrm { m L }$ , the analytical sensitivity was determined to be $1 \mathrm { \bar { x } } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ copies/mL, which was the lowest concentration at which $9 5 \%$ (19/20) of the replicates for each individual marker tested demonstrated measurable amplification.

# Limit of Quantitation

Two clinical pools were prepared: a Viral pool (Low Bacterial/High Viral/ Low Severity) and a Bacterial/Severe pool (High Bacterial/Low Viral/ High Severity). Samples were then serially diluted in leukoreduced blood. The Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) for each pool was defined as the lowest WBC concentration at which $9 5 \%$ (19/20) of the replicates provided a score with a standard deviation less than 5.50 score units for all 3 score types. The overall LOQ was defined as the higher of the LOQs calculated for each sample pool. Samples were tested with two cartridge lots across multiple days, instruments, and sample types, for a total of 220 runs. Results indicated that the higher LoQ was approximately 500 WBC cells $\mu \mathrm { L }$ for both sample pools.

# 8. Assay Cut-Off:

There are three score types (Bacterial, Viral, and Severity) with five interpretation bands (Very High, High, Moderate, Low, Very Low). Cut-offs were defined ahead of the clinical validation study, and the assay performance was evaluated in the clinical study using those pre-defined cutoffs as compared to adjudicated results.

9. Accuracy (Instrument): Not applicable.

10. Carry-Over:

A study was performed to evaluate the risk of carry-over or amplicon contamination between runs tested on the Myrna instrument. Carry-over was assessed by alternating testing between panel members B (Very High Bacterial Score/Very Low Viral Score/Very High Severity Score), C (Very Low Bacterial Score/Very High Viral Score/Very Low Severity Score), and F (Very Low Bacterial Score/Very Low Viral Score/Very Low Severity Score). A total of 60 samples were tested over two days using three instruments, with 10 runs per instrument per day, as shown below:

Within-run standard deviation was $< 5 . 5 0$ for all tested samples, panel members B, C and F for each sample score result (Bacterial, Viral, and Severity). Overall standard deviation for all runs and instruments was also $< 5 . 5 0$ . Results, presented in Table 8 below, indicate that the carry-over results are acceptable.

# 1. Clinical Sensitivity:

The clinical performance of the TriVerity test was evaluated through a multi-center, noninterventional study (SEPSIS-SHIELD, Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04094818) conducted across 22 sites comprised of emergency departments (EDs) and academic hospitals in the United States and Europe. Patients were enrolled and samples collected during two sequential phases: a frozen phase where samples were banked for testing and a fresh phase where samples were collected and tested prospectively. A fresh versus frozen study was conducted and demonstrated comparable results, allowing for data to be pooled during analysis. There were two primary objectives, the first was to establish the diagnostic performance for differentiating bacterial from viral infection in adult patients with suspected acute infection (infection and at least one abnormal vital sign) or suspected sepsis (defined by a blood culture order and at least two abnormal vital signs). The second primary objective was to establish the prognostic performance for predicting severe illness in patients with suspected acute infection or sepsis. Illness severity was defined by clinical outcomes (i.e., whether a patient received mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and/or renal replacement therapy [RRT] within 7 days of enrollment).

For the first primary objective, diagnostic performance of the TriVerity test for identifying bacterial or viral infection was compared to physician adjudication. Medical experts independently reviewed all available clinical data collected during standard of care as well as data collected as part of the study protocol, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) values, while remaining blinded to the TriVerity test results. Two independent analyses were conducted based on the clinical adjudication results:

1. Forced Evaluation – To define the ground truth, forced adjudication was used as the comparator method where physicians were forced to make a bacterial or viral diagnosis (certain [Yes or No] or uncertain [Probable or Unlikely] infection status). The primary diagnostic performance evaluation of the device was based on the Forced Endpoint.

2. Consensus Evaluation – Consensus expert adjudication was used as a comparator method in which uncertain (Probable or Unlikely) cases were removed. Although data from these analyses are presented, the consensus adjudication should be considered supplementary information.

For the second primary objective, all enrolled participants followed through the first seven days were eligible for inclusion if information was available on the presence of severe illness. For a patient to be evaluated the use of mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use, and/or RRT had to be associated with the acute episode of care in the ED but not chronic exposure (e.g., continuation of home care or short-term use around surgical or other procedures).

Patient demographics and medical history for the study population was comparable across all analyzed subgroups (forced evaluation, consensus evaluation, and severity prognosis). The forced evaluation endpoint population was comprised of 1,222 patients (289 prospectively recruited and 933 banked frozen samples). The mean age was 50.9 years with $4 9 . 5 \%$ female. The race and ethnicity representation were as follows: Hispanic/Latino $1 1 . 0 \%$ , Asian $0 . 9 \%$ , Black or African American $2 9 . 5 \%$ , and White $6 4 . 3 \%$ . Out of the 1,222 patients enrolled in the forced adjudication cohort, a total of 1,120 individuals were also included in the severity prognostic endpoint population (262 prospectively recruited and 858 banked frozen samples). The mean age for the severity prognostic cohort was 51.3 years with $4 8 . 6 \%$ of enrolled individuals identified as female. Race and ethnicity showed similar levels of distribution as the diagnostic population (Hispanic/Latino $1 1 . 4 \%$ , Asian $0 . 7 \%$ , Black or African American $2 8 . 7 \%$ , and White $6 5 . 5 \%$ ). Metabolic/endocrinological, respiratory tract, and cardiovascular illnesses were the most frequently represented disorders across all study populations. Malignancies were the most frequent type of immunosuppression, reported in approximately $10 \%$ of all study participants, followed by solid organ transplantation, steroid treatment, and HIV/AIDS. A total of 219 $( 1 7 . 9 \% )$ participants in the diagnostic population were immunosuppressed; among these, 30 fell into more than one of the immunosuppression categories. A total of 206 $( 1 8 . 4 \% )$ participants in the severity prognosis population were immunosuppressed. Among these, 30 participants fell into more than one immunosuppression category. Vital signs at time of enrollment showed that most patients had heart beats $> 9 0$ beats/minute while altered mental status was observed in $4 . 7 - 5 . 1 \%$ of patients.

The disease prevalence (pre-test probability), predictive values (post-test probability), likelihood ratios (with $80 \%$ confidence intervals calculated by bootstrap analysis), and the frequency of results for each score type and interpretation band generated by the of the TriVerity test are presented below for the diagnosis of bacterial and viral infections in addition to prognosis of illness severity. The likelihood ratios (LR) were calculated using the definition where LR equals the probability that an individual with disease has the test result divided by the probability that an individual without disease has the test result. This formula was applied to each interpretation band separately. Predictive values depend on the likelihood ratios and the prevalence of disease.

# Clinical Performance Evaluation for Primary Diagnostic Endpoint – Bacterial Score

Results for the performance of the TriVerity device for diagnosing the likelihood of bacterial infection showed a monotonic increase with no overlapping of the $80 \%$ CIs between nonadjacent interpretation bands. This demonstrates a relationship between the TriVerity Bacterial score and the increasing likelihood of bacterial infection across each interpretation band. For the forced adjudicated population, $8 0 . 4 \%$ of the results fell into the clinically actionable Very High, High, Low or Very Low interpretation bands $4 0 . 8 \%$ Very High and High, $3 9 . 6 \%$ Very Low and Low interpretation bands); only $1 9 . 6 \%$ of results were found in the moderate interpretation band which had a LR of 0.9. At a prevalence of $6 0 . 6 \%$ for bacterial infections, the positive predictive values of the outer Very High and Very Low interpretation bands were $8 9 . 0 \%$ and $2 0 . 0 \%$ , respectively. Forced and consensus diagnostic results were similar; however, consensus adjudicated results performed better due to the removal of uncertain bacterial infection status.

Results for the TriVerity test performance for diagnosis of the likelihood of viral infection demonstrated a monotonic increase between bands with no overlapping of the $80 \%$ CIs between non-adjacent interpretation bands. For the forced adjudicated population, $8 4 . 9 \%$ of the results fell into the clinically actionable Very High, High, Low or Very Low interpretation bands $( 2 0 . 0 \%$ Very High and High, $6 5 . 0 \%$ Very Low and Low interpretation bands); $1 5 . 1 \%$ of results were found in the moderate interpretation band which had a LR of 1.0. At a prevalence of $2 5 . 5 \%$ for viral infections, the positive predictive values of the outer Very High and Very Low interpretation bands were $8 5 . 3 \%$ and $6 . 8 \%$ , respectively. The consensus diagnostic results showed much higher LR for the Very High interpretation band (LR: 40.9) and much lower LR for the Very Low interpretation band (LR: 0.1).

Table 15 shows the performance of the TriVerity test for the prediction of illness severity as defined by the need for mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and/or RRT within 7 days. The Severity score demonstrated a monotonic increase between bands with no overlapping of the $80 \%$ CIs between non-adjacent interpretation bands. A total of $7 9 . 6 \%$ of results were observed in the clinically actionable Very High, High, Very Low and Low interpretation bands; $1 8 . 8 \%$ of these in the Very High and High bands, $6 0 . 7 \%$ in the Low and Very Low bands. At a prevalence of $1 0 . 9 \%$ , the probabilities of having severe illness were $5 8 . 1 \%$ and $2 . 7 \%$ for the Very High and Very Low interpretation bands. The data demonstrated a relationship between the TriVerity test results and the likelihood of needing mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and/or RRT within 7 days.

2. Clinical Specificity: See Clinical Sensitivity above.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):

Subgroup Analyses

Subgroup analyses were performed based on individual patient demographic data and medical history, including race/ethnicity, immunocompromised status, SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as by enrollment criteria (suspected acute infection versus suspected sepsis).

For subgroups with a sufficient number of patients for statistical analysis, an increase in TriVerity scores appeared to correspond to an increase in likelihood for diagnosing bacterial and viral infections.

Performance by Race and Ethnicity

Substantial differences were not observed in the diagnostic performance of the TriVerity test between Black/African Americans and other races or between ethnicities (Hispanic or Latino versus Not Hispanic or Latino) using forced adjudication. AUROCs for the accuracy of the bacterial results of the TriVerity test among White, Black/African American vs. participants of other races were 0.76, 0.76 and 0.84, respectively. AUROCs for the viral results were 0.81, 0.83 and 0.90, respectively.

For the illness severity prognosis endpoint, race did not impact the performance of Severity result readout of the TriVerity test. Across a diverse cohort of participants enrolled, LRs for the five interpretation bands in the TriVerity test did not differ markedly between Black/African Americans and White patients or between Hispanic or Latino and NonHispanic or Latino patients. The number of Asian, American Indian or Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander patients was not sufficient to evaluate potential differences individually. AUROCs for the TriVerity illness severity results were 0.79 for Black/African Americans versus 0.78 for other races.

# Performance by Immune Competency Status

Additional analyses were conducted to determine whether the presence of immunosuppression in study participants affected the performance of the TriVerity test. Likelihood ratios and AUROCs for the Bacterial and Viral TriVerity results in the forced adjudicated population did not differ markedly based on participants with $( \mathrm { N } = 2 1 9 )$ ) or without immunosuppression $( \mathrm { N } = 1 { , } 0 0 3 )$ ). Results are presented below in Tables 36 – 38. Likelihood ratios ranged from 0.1 to 20.3 in immunosuppressed participants and ranged from 0.2 to 20.0 in immunocompetent participants across all three score types.

Performance by enrollment criteria (suspected of acute infection versus suspected sepsis)

Additional analyses were performed to identify whether performance of the TriVerity test differed among different enrollment cohorts (i.e., individuals with suspected acute infection and at least 1 abnormal vital sign vs. individuals with suspected sepsis with at least 2 abnormal vital signs). Analysis of TriVerity Bacterial Score results (Table 39) and Viral Score (Table 39) test results are summarized below. Among the forced adjudication cohort of patients, LRs ranged from 0.2 in the Very Low to 5.4 in the Very High TriVerity Bacterial bands for participants enrolled with suspected acute infection with ${ \geq } 1$ vital sign change. Among participants with suspected sepsis with ${ \ge } 2$ vital sign changes, the likelihood ratios ranged from 0.1 to 4.9. LRs for the Viral TriVerity interpretation bands also did not differ markedly between participants enrolled under either of the two inclusion criteria. AUROCs for the Bacterial TriVerity results were 0.81 and 0.72 in participants with suspected acute infection with ${ \geq } 1$ vital sign change vs. suspected sepsis with ${ \ge } 2$ vital sign change. Similarly, AUROCs for the viral TriVerity results were 0.83 and 0.83 for participants with a suspected infection plus ${ \geq } 1$ vital sign change vs. suspected sepsis with ${ \ge } 2$ vital sign. These results demonstrate that the inclusion criteria used at the time of enrollment did not impact the performance of TriVerity Bacterial and Viral results. Table 41 outlines the prognostic severity results. AUROC for TriVerity severity results in the population with suspected acute Infection with ${ \geq } 1$ vital sign change was 0.84 and was 0.72 for the suspected sepsis with ${ \ge } 2$ vital signs change population.

Performance by Viral Respiratory Infection

To assess whether the TriVerity Viral score could adequately identify SARS-COV-2 infections, additional subgroup analysis was performed in enrolled individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Due to the lack of a control group (patients tested and negative for SARS-CoV-2) performance for this population could not be independently assess based on the LRs. However, most patients were assigned to either the Very High, High, or Moderate likelihood interpretation bands. A limitation statement has been included in the labeling that this test is not meant to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections.

$\mathrm { n / a }$ ; not applicable

Numbers for influenza A and B infections $( \mathrm { N } = 2 7 )$ ) were too low to present as a separate analysis (reflecting the epidemiology of viral diseases in the US during the study phases). A limitation statement has been included in the labeling that this test is not meant to diagnose influenza.

# D Clinical Cut-Off:

Following training of the TriVerity classifier, thresholds between the interpretation bands for each result were set based on data collected on the cartridge. Cut-off values for the TriVerity test were established prior to the clinical trial. Samples used for setting the thresholds $\mathbf { \tilde { n } } = 3 9 9$ ) were collected from single site and multicenter Emergency Departments and ICUs that were independent from the pivotal clinical study. Thresholds were optimized using the procedure outlined below:

Set initial threshold targeting $9 5 \%$ Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) in band 1 (very low likelihood), $9 5 \%$ Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) in band 5 (very high likelihood), and $10 \%$ moderate band coverage on each axis (bacterial, viral, illness severity)   
For each score, examine band 1/5 fraction (i.e., percentage of results in bands 1 and 5 combined) and consider relaxing initial thresholds between bands 1 and 2 and between bands 4 and 5 to ensure maximal outer coverage. This was noted as minor reductions in PPA or NPA below $9 5 \%$ may give significant increases in outer band coverage, which in turn may provide greater benefit to more patients.   
Examine and adjust for monotonicity, aiming for roughly likelihood ratios 0.3-0.5 in band 2, roughly 0.9-1.2 in band 3, and 1.8-2.5 in band 4, to ensure clear gradations of separability.   
Examine standard deviation per band, ensuring none is substantially greater than 4.5 and adjust thresholds if necessary.   
Globally re-examine all metrics (PPA/NPA in outer bands; band fraction; moderate coverage; LR monotonicity; and standard deviation) and perform one final refinement to balance competing metrics if needed. Where band fraction is the percentage of patients in a one or more given bands, moderate coverage is the percentage of patients in the middle band, and LR monotonicity is likelihood monotonicity.

# E Expected Values/Reference Range:

A reference range study was conducted to establish the performance of the TriVerity Acute Infection and Sepsis Test with a healthy population. Samples were collected from diverse geographical locations in the U.S. and India from individuals who self-reported their healthy status. A total of 120 remnant samples were obtained from previous clinical studies and commercial bio-banked samples. The presumed healthy population included male and female patients 18 – 71 years old with a mean age of 41 years. Results from the study are included in Tables 43 – 46 and stratified by demographic group.
