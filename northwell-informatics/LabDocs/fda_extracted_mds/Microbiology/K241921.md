# 1.4 Device Description

The Alinity m BKV assay utilizes real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify and detect BKV genomic DNA sequences that have been extracted from human EDTA plasma or urine specimens. The steps of the Alinity m BKV assay consist of sample preparation, real-time PCR assembly, amplification/detection, result calculation, and reporting. One transfer step of urine specimens into the Alinity m Urine Transport Kit by the user is required prior to placing urine specimens on the Alinity m System. Remaining steps of the Alinity m BKV assay procedure are executed automatically by the Alinity m System. Manual dilutions may be performed for low-volume plasma specimens to meet the minimum volume requirement. The Alinity m System is designed to be a randomaccess analyzer that can perform the Alinity m BKV assay in parallel with other Alinity m assays on the same instrument.

Alinity m BKV requires three separate assay specific kits as follows:

Alinity m BKV AMP Kit (List No. 09N85-095), consisting of 2 types of multi-well assay trays. The amplification tray (AMP TRAY 1) contains liquid, unit-dose PCR amplification/detection reagents and liquid, unit-dose Internal Control (IC) in separate wells; and the activation tray (ACT TRAY 2) contains liquid, unit-dose activation reagent. The intended storage condition for the Alinity m BKV AMP Kit is $- 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $- 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Alinity m BKV CTRL Kit (List No. 09N85-085), consisting of negative controls, low positive controls, and high positive controls, each supplied as liquid in single-use tubes. The intended storage condition for the Alinity m BKV CTRL Kit is $- 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $- 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Alinity m BKV CAL Kit (List No. 09N85-075), consisting of 2 calibrator levels, each supplied as liquid in single-use tubes. The intended storage condition for the Alinity m BKV CAL Kit is $- 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $- 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

The Alinity m BKV assay requires a transport kit for testing all urine specimens:

Alinity m Urine Transport Kit (List No. 09N85-001) consisting of a transport tube and transfer pipette. The transport tube contains transport buffer. The intended storage condition for the Alinity m Urine Transport Kit is $1 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .

BKV DNA from human plasma or urine is extracted automatically on board the Alinity m System using the Alinity m Sample Prep Kit 2, Alinity m Lysis Solution, and Alinity m Diluent Solution. The Alinity m System employs magnetic microparticle technology to facilitate nucleic acid capture, wash, and elution. The resulting purified DNA is then combined with liquid unit-dose Alinity m BKV activation reagent and liquid unit-dose Alinity m BKV amplification/detection reagents and transferred into a reaction vessel. Alinity m Vapor Barrier Solution is then added to the reaction vessel which is then transferred to an amplification/detection unit for PCR amplification and real-time fluorescence detection of BKV DNA.

At the beginning of the Alinity m BKV sample preparation process, a liquid unit-dose IC on the AMP Tray is transferred by the Alinity m System and delivered into each sample preparation reaction. The IC is then processed through the entire sample preparation and real-time PCR procedure along with the specimens, calibrators, and controls to demonstrate proper sample processing and validity.

The Alinity m BKV amplification/detection reagents consist of enzymes, primers, probes, and activation reagents that enable amplification and detection of dual targets in the BKV genome. Amplification and detection of the two BKV targets ensures sensitive detection of the viral genome even at low levels. In addition to the BKV primers and probes, the assay utilizes an IC primer/probe set for amplification and detection of the IC target sequence, which is not related to BKV. The IC probe is labeled with a different fluorophore than the BKV probes. This allows for simultaneous detection and discrimination of both the BKV and IC amplified products within the same reaction vessel.

A BKV calibration curve is required for determination of BKV DNA concentration. Two levels of calibrators are processed through sample preparation and PCR to generate the calibration curve. The concentration of BKV DNA in specimens and controls is then calculated from the stored calibration curve.

Assay controls are tested at or above an established minimum frequency to help ensure that instrument and reagent performance remains satisfactory. During each control event, a negative control, a low-positive control, and a high positive control are processed through sample preparation and PCR procedures that are identical to those used for specimens.

The Alinity m BKV assay also utilizes the following:

• Alinity m BKV Application Specification File (List No. 09N85-05A)   
• Alinity m System and System Software (List No. 08N53-002)   
• Alinity m Sample Prep Kit 2 (List No. 09N12-001)   
• Alinity m Specimen Dilution Kit I (List No. 09N50-001)   
• Alinity m System Solutions, (List No. 09N20): o Alinity m Lysis Solution (List No. 09N20-001) o Alinity m Diluent Solution (List No. 09N20-003) o Alinity m Vapor Barrier Solution, (List No. 09N20-004)   
• Alinity m Tubes and Caps (List No. 09N49): o Alinity m LRV Tube (List No. 09N49-001) o Alinity m Transport Tubes Pierceable Capped (List No. 09N49-010) o Alinity m Transport Tube (List No. 09N49-011) o Alinity m Pierceable Cap (List No. 09N49-012) o Alinity m Aliquot Tube (List No. 09N49-013)

# 1.8 Performance Data

The following performance data were provided in support of safety, effectiveness, and substantial equivalence determination of the device.

# 1.8.1 Specific Performance Characteristics

# 1.8.1.1 Traceability to the WHO Standard

Primary calibrators and assay product calibrators with known concentrations were used throughout product development and product manufacturing to establish traceability to the $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard for BK virus for Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques (NIBSC code: 14/212). The concentrations tested for the WHO standard were 3.00 Log IU/mL and 5.00 Log IU/mL. The target concentrations tested for the primary calibrators were 2.91 Log IU/mL and 6.94 Log IU/mL. The Alinity m BKV product calibrators and controls were also tested along with the primary calibrators and the WHO standard. All the tested material had observed BKV concentrations similar to the target concentrations and were linear across the assay’s quantitation range, as presented in Figure 1.

# 1.8.1.2.3 Linear Range

The quantitation range of Alinity m BKV for plasma is from the lower limit of quantitation (LLoQ) of $5 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ (1.70 Log IU/mL) to the upper limit of quantitation (ULoQ) of 1,000,000,000 IU/mL (9.00 Log IU/mL). Linearity of Alinity m BKV was assessed by testing a dilution series of BKV subgroup Ib in BKV-negative

human EDTA plasma, consisting of 15 panel levels targeted in the range of $3 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to 2,000,000,000 IU/mL (1.48 Log IU/mL to 9.30 Log IU/mL).

Plasma panel was prepared either using the $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ WHO International Standard for BK virus (NIBSC code: 14/212, subgroup Ib) for multiple levels ranging from $3 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to 100,000 IU/mL (1.48 Log IU/mL to 5.00 Log IU/mL) or using armored DNA for the remaining levels ranging from $1 0 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to 2,000,000,000 IU/mL (2.00 Log IU/mL to 9.30 Log IU/mL).

# 1.8.1.2.4 Linearity for Genotypes

Linearity of Alinity m BKV for subgroups/subtypes Ia, Ic, II, III, and IV was confirmed by testing a dilution series in BKV-negative human EDTA plasma, consisting of 13 panel levels for subgroup/subtypes Ia, III, and IV and 12 panel levels for

subgroup/subtype Ic and II, targeted in the range of $3 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to 2,000,000,000 IU/mL (1.48 Log IU/mL to 9.30 Log IU/mL).

For subgroup/subtypes Ia, III, and IV, plasma panel was prepared either using clinical specimens for multiple levels ranging from 30 IU/mL to $1 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ (1.48 Log IU/mL to $5 . 0 0 \mathrm { L o g } \mathrm { I U / m L } )$ or using armored DNA for the remaining levels ranging from $2 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to 2,000,000,000 IU/mL (2.30 Log IU/mL to 9.30 Log IU/mL). For subgroup/subtype Ic and II, plasma panel was prepared using armored DNA for all levels ranging from $3 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to 2,000,000,000 IU/mL (1.48 Log IU/mL to 9.30 Log IU/mL).

Alinity m BKV was linear in plasma across the quantitation range from $5 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ (1.70 Log IU/mL) to 1,000,000,000 IU/mL (9.00 Log IU/mL) for subgroups/subtypes Ia, Ic, II, III, and IV.

# 1.8.1.2.5 Precision

Precision of Alinity m BKV was determined by analyzing an 7-member panel prepared in BKV-negative human plasma. All panel members were prepared using clinical specimens. Each panel member was tested in 4 replicates, twice each day for 12 days, on 3 Alinity m Systems operated by 3 operators (one operator per instrument), using 3 AMP kit lots (one lot per instrument), for a total of 288 replicates per panel member.

The representative precision results in Table 8 and Table 9 demonstrated that Alinity m BKV within-laboratory standard deviation (SD) in plasma was less than or equal to $0 . 2 5 \mathrm { L o g } \mathrm { I U } / \mathrm { m L }$ for BKV DNA panels within the range of $2 . 7 0 \mathrm { L o g } \mathrm { I U } / \mathrm { m L }$ to 9.00 Log IU/mL (500 IU/mL to $1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { I U / m L } \rangle$ , and less than or equal to $0 . 5 0 \mathrm { L o g } \mathrm { I U } / \mathrm { m L }$ for BKV DNA panels within the range of 1.70 Log IU/mL to less than 2.70 Log IU/mL ( $5 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to less than $5 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ ).

# 1.8.1.2.6 Lower Limit of Quantitation (LLoQ)

The LLoQ is defined as the lowest concentration at which BKV DNA is reliably quantitated within an acceptable total error of ≤ 1.00 Log IU/mL.

Total error was estimated for detected plasma samples from the LoD study by 2 methods:

• Total Analytical Error $( \mathrm { T A E } ) = | \mathrm { b i a s } | + 2 \times \mathrm { S D } .$ , and • Total Error $( \mathrm { T E } ) = \mathrm { S Q R T } ( 2 ) \times 2 \times \mathrm { S D }$

The results of the calculations are shown in Table 10.

Panel members were dilutions of the $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ WHO International Standard for BK Virus (NIBSC code: 14/212, subgroup Ib) prepared in BKV-negative plasma.

The results of these analyses support a claimed LLoQ for Alinity m BKV of $5 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ (1.70 Log IU/mL) in plasma, with an acceptable level of accuracy and precision (ie, TAE and TE less than or equal to 1.00 Log IU/mL).

BKV armored DNA for subgroup Ic and subtype II and clinical specimens for BKV subgroup Ia and subtypes III and IV were diluted to 5 different concentrations in BKVnegative stabilized urine. Testing was performed using one lot of amplification reagents across multiple days. The results, representative of the analytical sensitivity performance of Alinity m BKV for BKV subgroups Ia and Ic and subtypes II, III, and IV, are

summarized in Table 19 for urine. Alinity m BKV detected $9 5 \%$ or greater of BKV samples at and above $4 5 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ (1.65 Log IU/mL) in urine. These results demonstrate the ability of Alinity m BKV to detect BKV subgroups Ia and Ic and subtypes II, III, and IV at the claimed LoD in urine.

# 1.8.1.3.3 Linear Range

The quantitation range of Alinity m BKV for urine is from the lower limit of quantitation (LLoQ) of $5 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ $( 1 . 7 0 \mathrm { L o g } \mathrm { I U } / \mathrm { m L } )$ ) to the upper limit of quantitation (ULoQ) of 1,000,000,000 IU/mL (9.00 Log IU/mL). Linearity of Alinity m BKV was assessed by testing a dilution series of BKV subgroup Ib in

BKV-negative stabilized urine, consisting of 16 panel levels targeted in the range of $3 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to 3,000,000,000 IU/mL (1.48 Log IU/mL to 9.48 Log IU/mL).

Urine panel was prepared either using the $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ WHO International Standard for BK virus (NIBSC code: 14/212, subgroup Ib) for multiple levels ranging from $3 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to 150,000 IU/mL (1.48 Log IU/mL to 5.18 Log IU/mL) or using armored DNA for the remaining levels ranging from $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to 3,000,000,000 IU/mL (2.18 Log IU/mL to 9.48 Log IU/mL).

Alinity m BKV was linear across the quantitation range from $5 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ (1.70 Log IU/mL) to 1,000,000,000 IU/mL (9.00 Log IU/mL). Representative results for Alinity m BKV linearity performance are shown in Figure 4.

# 1.8.1.3.4 Linearity for Genotypes

Linearity of Alinity m BKV for subgroups/subtypes Ia, Ic, II, III, and IV was confirmed by testing a dilution series in BKV-negative stabilized urine, consisting of 14 panel levels for subgroup/subtypes Ia, III, and IV and 13 panel levels for subgroup/subtype Ic and II, targeted in the range of $3 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to 3,000,000,000 IU/mL (1.48 Log IU/mL to 9.48 Log IU/mL).

For subgroup/subtypes Ia, III, and IV, urine panel was prepared either using clinical specimens for multiple levels ranging from 30 IU/mL to $1 5 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { \ : I U / m L }$ (1.48 Log IU/mL to $5 . 1 8 \mathrm { L o g } \mathrm { I U / m L } )$ or using armored DNA for the remaining levels ranging from $3 0 0 \mathrm { \ : I U / m L }$ to 3,000,000,000 IU/mL (2.48 Log IU/mL to 9.48 Log IU/mL). For subgroup/subtype Ic and II, urine panel was prepared using armored DNA for all levels ranging from $3 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to 3,000,000,000 IU/mL (1.48 Log IU/mL to 9.48 Log IU/mL).

Alinity m BKV was linear in urine across the quantitation range from $5 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ (1.70 Log IU/mL) to 1,000,000,000 IU/mL (9.00 Log IU/mL) for subgroups/subtypes Ia, Ic, II, III, and IV. Representative results for Alinity m BKV linearity performance for subgroups/subtypes Ia, Ic, II, III, and IV, along with results for subgroup Ib (Section 1.7.1.3.3), are shown in Figure 5.

# 1.8.1.3.5 Precision

Precision of Alinity m BKV was determined by analyzing an 8-member panel prepared in BKV-negative stabilized human urine. All panel members were prepared using clinical specimens. Each panel member was tested in 4 replicates, twice each day for 12 days, on 3 Alinity m Systems operated by 3 operators (one operator per instrument), using 3 AMP kit lots (one lot per instrument), for a total of 288 replicates per panel member.

The representative precision results in Table 20 and Table 21 demonstrated that Alinity m BKV within-laboratory standard deviation (SD) in urine was less than or equal to $0 . 2 5 \mathrm { L o g } \mathrm { I U } / \mathrm { m L }$ for BKV DNA panels within the range of $2 . 7 0 \mathrm { L o g } \mathrm { I U } / \mathrm { m L }$ to 9.00 Log IU/mL (500 IU/mL to $1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { I U / m L } )$ ) and less than or equal to $0 . 5 0 \mathrm { L o g } \mathrm { I U } / \mathrm { m L }$ for BKV DNA panels within the range of 1.70 Log IU/mL to less than 2.70 Log IU/mL ( $5 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ to less than $5 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ ).

# 1.8.1.3.6 Lower Limit of Quantitation (LLoQ)

The LLoQ is defined as the lowest concentration at which BKV DNA is reliably quantitated within an acceptable total error of $\leq 1 . 0 0$ Log IU/mL. Total error was estimated for detected urine samples from the LoD study by 2 methods:

• Total Analytical Error $( \mathrm { T A E } ) = | \mathrm { b i a s } | + 2 \times \mathrm { S D } .$ , and • Total Er $\mathrm { r o r } \left( \mathrm { T E } \right) = \mathrm { S Q R T } ( 2 ) \times 2 \times \mathrm { S D }$

The results of the calculations are shown in Table 22.

Panel members were dilutions of the $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ WHO International Standard for BK Virus (NIBSC code: 14/212, subgroup Ib) prepared in BKV-negative urine stabilized in transport buffer (Alinity m Urine Transport Kit).

The results of these analyses support a claimed LLoQ for Alinity m BKV of $5 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ (1.70 Log IU/mL) in urine, with an acceptable level of accuracy and precision (ie, TAE and TE less than or equal to 1.00 Log IU/mL).

# 1.8.2.1 Clinical Reproducibility for Plasma Sample Type

Reproducibility performance of Alinity m BKV was evaluated by testing a 9-member reproducibility panel, including 8 positive panel members and 1 negative panel member. The positive panel members were prepared using a BKV positive clinical specimen or cultured virus diluted in human EDTA plasma. A total of 3 Alinity m BKV AMP Kit lots, 3 Alinity m BKV CAL Kit lots, 3 Alinity m BKV CTRL Kit lots, and 3 Alinity m Sample Prep Kit 2 lots were used. Three clinical sites each tested 2 Alinity m BKV AMP Kit lots on 5 non-consecutive days for each lot. Six replicates of each panel member were tested on each of the 5 days. Each of the 3 clinical sites used different lots of Alinity m BKV CAL Kit, Alinity m BKV CTRL Kit, and Alinity m Sample Prep Kit 2. The reproducibility results are summarized in Table 25 and Table 26 (for the positive panel members) and Table 27 (for the negative panel member).

# 1.8.2.2 Clinical Reproducibility for Urine Sample Type

Reproducibility performance of Alinity m BKV was evaluated by testing a 9-member reproducibility panel, including 8 positive panel members and 1 negative panel member in urine stabilized in transport buffer (Alinity m Urine Transport Kit). The positive panel members were prepared using a BKV positive clinical specimen, cultured virus, or plasmid DNA diluted with urine stabilized in transport buffer. A total of 3 Alinity m BKV AMP Kit lots, 3 Alinity m BKV CAL Kit lots, 3 Alinity m BKV CTRL Kit lots, and 3 Alinity m Sample Prep Kit 2 lots were used. Three clinical sites each tested 2 Alinity m BKV AMP Kit lots on 5 non-consecutive days for each lot. Six replicates of each panel member were tested on each of the 5 days. Each of the 3 clinical sites used different lots of Alinity m BKV CAL Kit, Alinity m BKV CTRL Kit, and Alinity m Sample Prep Kit 2. The reproducibility results are summarized in Table 28 and Table 29 (for the positive panel members) and Table 30 (for the negative panel member).
