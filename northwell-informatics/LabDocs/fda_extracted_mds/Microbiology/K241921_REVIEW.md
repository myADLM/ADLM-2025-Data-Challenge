II Submission/Device Overview:

A Purpose for Submission:

To obtain clearance for the Alinity m BKV assay.

# B Measurand:

BK virus (BKV) DNA

# C Type of Test:

The Alinity m BKV assay is a quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) performed on the automated Alinity m System, for the detection of BKV DNA in transplant patients.

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

# A Intended Use(s):

Alinity m BKV is an in vitro nucleic acid amplification test for the quantitation of BK virus (BKV) DNA in human EDTA plasma (K2 EDTA, K3 EDTA, and PPT) and urine stabilized using the Alinity m Urine Transport Kit on the automated Alinity m System. In EDTA plasma (K2EDTA, K3EDTA, and PPT) and urine stabilized using the Alinity m Urine Transport Kit, Alinity m BKV is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis and management of BKV in transplant patients.

In patients undergoing monitoring of BKV in EDTA plasma, serial DNA measurements can be used to indicate the need for potential treatment changes and to assess viral response to treatment.

The results from Alinity m BKV must be interpreted in conjunction with clinical signs and symptoms and other relevant laboratory findings. Alinity m BKV is not cleared as a screening test for blood or blood products or human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products.

B Indication(s) for Use: Same as Intended Use

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Rx - For Prescription Use Only

D Special Instrument Requirements:

For use with the Alinity m System.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The Alinity m BKV assay is an automated assay for the quantitative detection of BKV genomic DNA in human plasma or urine specimens utilizing real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Alinity m BKV contain different components: Reagents (PCR amplification, detection, and internal control), Calibrator and Controls. The Alinity m BKV assay requires a transport kit for testing all urine specimens.

# B Principle of Operation:

BKV DNA from human plasma or urine is extracted automatically on board the Alinity m System. The Alinity m System employs magnetic microparticle technology to facilitate nucleic acid capture, wash, and elution. The purified DNA is combined with the Alinity m BKV activation reagent and the Alinity m BKV amplification/detection reagents and transferred into a reaction vessel. Alinity m Vapor Barrier Solution is then added to the reaction vessel which is then transferred to an amplification/detection unit for PCR amplification and real-time fluorescence detection of BKV DNA. In addition to the BKV primers and probes, the assay utilizes an IC primer/probe set for amplification and detection of the IC target sequence, which is not related to BKV. Manual dilutions may be performed for low-volume plasma specimens to meet the minimum volume requirement. A BKV calibration curve is required for determination of BKV DNA concentration. Two levels of calibrators are processed through sample preparation and PCR to generate the calibration curve. The concentration of BKV DNA in specimens and controls is then calculated from the stored calibration curve. Assay controls (negative, low positive and high positive controls) are tested to ensure that instrument and reagent performance remains satisfactory.

# Interpretation of Results:

# 2. Linearity

# a. Linearity in Plasma:

# 3. Lower Limit of Quantitation (LLoQ)

# a. LLoQ in Plasma

The LLoQ is defined as the lowest concentration at which BKV DNA is reliably quantitated within an acceptable total error $\mathrm { { o f } \leq 1 . 0 0 \ L o g I U / m L }$ . Total error was estimated for detected plasma samples from the LoD study by 2 methods:

Total Analytical Error $( \mathrm { T A E } ) = | \mathrm { b i a s } | + 2 \times \mathrm { S D }$ , and Total Error $( \mathrm { T E } ) = \mathrm { S Q R T } ( 2 ) \times 2 \times \mathrm { S D }$ .

Panel members were dilutions of the international standard material for BK Virus (NIBSC code: 14/212, subgroup Ib) prepared in BKV-negative plasma. The results of the calculations are shown in Table 7 and support a claimed LLoQ for Alinity m BKV of 50 $\mathrm { I U / m L }$ (1.70 Log IU/mL) in plasma.

b. Confirmation of LLoQ using Plasma Dilution Procedure

Confirmation testing for Alinity m BKV LLoQ using the dilution procedure was performed by testing 2 panel members at $1 2 5 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ $( 2 . 5 \times \mathrm { L L o Q } )$ and $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ $3 \times \mathrm { L L o Q } )$ with a dilution factor of 1:2.5. The BKV concentrations in the panel members were targeted at 50 $\mathrm { I U / m L }$ (LLoQ) and $6 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ (near LLoQ). Panel members were dilutions of the international standard material for BK Virus (NIBSC code: 14/212, subgroup Ib) prepared in BKV-negative plasma.

Total error was estimated by TAE and TE, as shown in Table 8. The accuracy and precision at $5 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ and $6 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ were confirmed for Alinity m BKV testing using the 1:2.5 dilution procedure.

The LLoQ is defined as the lowest concentration at which BKV DNA is reliably quantitated within an acceptable total error of $\dot { \mathbf { \theta } } \leq 1 . 0 0 \mathrm { L o g } \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

Total error was estimated for detected urine samples from the LoD study by 2 methods: Total Analytical Error (TAE) $= | { \bf b } { \bf i } { \bf a s } | + 2 \times \mathrm { S D }$ , and   
Total Error $( \mathrm { T E } ) = \mathrm { S Q R T } ( 2 ) \times 2 \times \mathrm { S D }$ .

Primary calibrators and assay product calibrators with known concentrations were used throughout product development and product manufacturing to establish traceability to the international standard material for BK virus (NIBSC code: 14/212, subgroup Ib). The

concentrations tested for the international standard material were 3.00 Log IU/mL and 5.00 Log $\mathrm { I U / m L }$ . The target concentrations tested for the primary calibrators were 2.91 Log $\mathrm { I U / m L }$ and $6 . 9 4 \mathrm { L o g } \mathrm { I U } / \mathrm { m L }$ . The Alinity m BKV product calibrators and controls were also tested along with the primary calibrators and the international standard material.

# a. Detection Limit for Plasma Samples:

The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by testing dilutions of the international standard material for BK virus for Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques (NIBSC code: 14/212, subgroup Ib) prepared in BKV-negative human plasma. Eight panel members with BKV concentration ranging from approximately 2.0 to $6 0 . 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ were tested. Testing for each BKV DNA concentration was performed with 3 lots of amplification reagents across multiple days in a minimum of 30 replicates per each panel member. The LoD was estimated from the detection rate and probit analysis. The claimed LoD of Alinity m BKV is $5 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ (1.70 Log IU/mL) in plasma.

b. Detection Limits for Genotypes in Plasma.

BKV armored DNA for subgroup Ic and subtype II and clinical specimens for BKV subgroup Ia and subtypes III and IV were diluted to 3 different concentrations (30, 50, and $6 0 \ : \mathrm { I U / m L }$ ) in BKV-negative human plasma using one lot of amplification reagents. The results demonstrated the ability of Alinity m BKV to detect BKV subgroups Ia and Ic and subtypes II, III, and IV at the claimed LoD of $5 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ (1.70 Log $\mathrm { I U / m L }$ ) in plasma.

# c. Detection Limit for Urine Samples.

The LoD was determined by testing dilutions of the international standard material for BK virus (NIBSC code: 14/212, subgroup Ib) prepared in BKV negative urine stabilized in transport buffer (Alinity m Urine Transport Kit). Nine panel members with BKV concentration ranging from approximately 3.0 to $3 3 0 . 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ were tested. Testing for each BKV DNA concentration was performed with 3 lots of amplification reagents across multiple days. The claimed LoD of Alinity m BKV is $5 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ $( 1 . 7 0 \log \mathrm { I U / m L } )$ ) in neat urine.

# d. Detection Limits for Genotypes in Urine.

BKV armored DNA for subgroup Ic and subtype II and clinical specimens for BKV subgroup Ia and subtypes III and IV were diluted to 5 different concentrations in BKV-negative stabilized urine, ranging from approximately 45.0 to $3 3 0 . 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ . Testing was performed using one lot of amplification reagents across multiple days. Alinity m BKV detected $9 5 \%$ or greater of BKV samples at and above $4 5 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ (1.65 Log IU/mL) in urine. The results

demonstrated the ability of Alinity m BKV the ability of Alinity m BKV to detect BKV subgroups Ia and Ic and subtypes II, III, and IV at the claimed LoD of 50 IU/mL (1.70 Log $\mathrm { I U / m L }$ ) in urine.
