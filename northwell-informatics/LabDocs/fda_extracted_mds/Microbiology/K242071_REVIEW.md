# A Device Description:

The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test, performed on the GeneXpert Xpress System, is an automated in vitro diagnostic test for the simultaneous qualitative detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and RSV viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and anterior nasal swab (ANS) specimens collected from individuals showing signs and symptoms of respiratory viral infection. The test is performed with three steps: 1) transfer liquid sample to the test cartridge with the transfer pipette (provided in the test kit), 2) run the test on the GeneXpert Xpress System, and 3) read the results.

The Hub configuration of the GeneXpert Xpress System includes a GeneXpert IV Instrument, an integrated barcode scanner, and a computer with a touchscreen and preloaded GeneXpert Xpress software designed for running tests and viewing results. The system requires the use of singleuse disposable cartridges that hold the RT-PCR reagents and host sample purification, nucleic acid amplification, and detection of the target sequences.

The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test cartridge includes all the necessary reagents for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B and RSV viral RNA from NPS and ANS specimens collected with nylon flocked swabs and placed into either $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ viral transport medium (VTM)/ universal transport medium (UTM) or $2 \mathrm { m L }$ eNAT. With a supplied transfer pipette, eluted NPS and ANS swab specimens are loaded into the sample chamber of a singleuse, self-contained Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test cartridge. Each Xpert Xpress CoV2/Flu/RSV plus test cartridge contains separate chambers for sample loading, sample processing, and target amplification by real-time RT-PCR, and includes all the reagents necessary to carry out these processes.

The primers and probes in the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test are designed to amplify and detect gene sequences for the following:

SARS-CoV-2 (envelope small membrane protein [E], a sequence in the N nucleocapsid   
protein [N2] and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRP])   
influenza A (matrix protein gene [MP], basic polymerase protein [PB2] and acidic   
protein [PA] genes from the viral polymerase complex)   
influenza B (Matrix protein gene and non-structural protein [NS] gene)   
RSV A and B (Nucleocapsid gene segment) viruses

A Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) are also included in the cartridge utilized by the GeneXpert instrument. The SPC is present to control for adequate processing of the sample and to monitor for the presence of potential inhibitor(s) in the RT-PCR reaction. The SPC also ensures that the RT-PCR reaction conditions (temperature and time) are appropriate for the amplification reaction and that the RT-PCR reagents are functioning as expected. The PCC verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling, and confirms that all reaction components are present in the cartridge including monitoring for probe integrity and dye stability. Because the cartridges are self-contained, and specimens never contact working parts of the instrument modules, cross-contamination between samples is minimized. The test

cartridge containing the patient sample is loaded onto one of four randomly accessible GeneXpert instrument modules, which performs fully automated and integrated sample preparation and real-time RT-PCR for the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test in approximately 36 minutes.

The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test can be run in one of five different modes, varying in the number of target analyte(s) tested for and reported. The five modes are: SARS-CoV-2 only; SARS-CoV-2 and Flu; SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV; Flu only; or Flu and RSV. For the SARS-CoV-2 only and Flu only modes, there is an option to activate an Early Assay Termination (EAT) function, which will provide earlier time to results in high titer specimens if the signal from the target nucleic acid reaches a predetermined threshold before the assay has finished running. When EAT is activated, the earliest time to a positive result is approximately 25 minutes. After completion of the test, the assay results are interpreted by the GeneXpert software from measured fluorescent signals and embedded calculation algorithms and are shown in the “View Results” window.

# B Principle of Operation:

The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test, performed on the GeneXpert Xpress System, is a nucleic acid-based test using real-time RT-PCR. After addition of the specimen to the Sample Chamber of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test cartridge, the cartridge is loaded onto the GeneXpert Xpress System platform. The instrument then performs automated sample processing including RNA extraction, followed by reverse transcription, amplification, detection, and reporting of results. The results are interpreted automatically by the GeneXpert Xpress System and are shown in the View Results window.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name:

GeneXpert Xpress System

2. Specimen Identification:

Sample ID is an identifier that links the sample being processed to the patient that provided the specimen. The Sample ID can be entered into the GeneXpert Xpress System either by scanning a barcode, entering the Sample ID manually using the virtual keyboard or having the system assign a random Sample ID.

To perform a test, the user selects “NEW TEST” icon from the Home Screen. Either patient information must be entered if configured by an administrator or the Sample ID screen appears. If the Patient Information screen appears, manually enter or scan the Patient ID barcode. If the Sample ID screen appears, scan the Sample ID barcode or manually enter the Sample ID for the patient specimen. The user is then instructed to scan the cartridge barcode and select the test to run. The prepared test cartridge is loaded into an available instrument module with the flashing green light to initiate the test.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test cartridge includes reagents for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B and RSV viral RNA in either nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) or anterior nasal swab (ANS) specimens. The NPS or NS specimen is collected using nylon flocked swabs and eluted into a transport tube containing $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of viral transport medium (VTM)/Universal Transport Medium (UTM) or $2 \mathrm { m L }$ of eNAT. At the test facility, the operator mixes the specimen by rapidly inverting the collection tube 5 times. A disposable transfer pipette supplied with the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus is used to transfer an aliquot of the specimen into the Sample Chamber of the Xpert Xpress CoV2/Flu/RSV plus test cartridge. After closing the cartridge lid, the GeneXpert cartridge is loaded onto the GeneXpert Xpress instrument, which automates and integrates sample preparation, nucleic acid extraction and amplification, and detection of target sequences in simple or complex samples using real-time PCR and RT-PCR assays.

# 4. Calibration:

Calibration of the GeneXpert Xpress instrument is performed at the factory, and recalibration in the field at customer sites is not required during the initial system startup. A GeneXpert operator or Field Service Engineer with Administrator user permissions can perform calibration checks during annual maintenance.

5. Quality Control:

Internal Controls

The GeneXpert Xpress System relies on the built-in internal controls included in each Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test cartridge to ensure the test system is performing as expected. These internal controls consist of Sample Processing Control (SPC) and Probe Check Control (PCC).

The Sample Processing Control (SPC) is a non-infectious armored RNA pseudovirus that ensures adequate processing of the sample and monitors the presence of potential inhibitors in the RT-PCR reaction. The SPC should be POSITIVE in a sample that is negative for all four target analytes (SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B and RSV), and can be NEGATIVE or POSITIVE in a sample containing detectable levels of one or more of the target analytes.

The PCC is present to control for sufficient reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling, probe integrity and dye stability. All assay reagents must be present and intact for the PCC to pass the validated acceptance criteria. If any of the PCC conditions fails, the result is reported as NO RESULT – REPEAT TEST and the test must be repeated using a new test cartridge.

# External Controls

External controls (ECs) are not required for the end users to obtain a valid Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test result. External controls are not provided with the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test. Optional external quality control materials are available from Zeptometrix. Specifically, the following external controls have been validated for use with the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test, performed on the GeneXpert Xpress System:

• External Positive Control: NATtrol Flu/RSV/SARS-CoV-2; Cat # NATFRC-6C-IVD • External Negative Control: Coxsackievirus A9; Cat # NATCV9-6C-IVD

All external controls must be used in accordance with local, state, and federal accrediting organizations, as applicable.

It is recommended that external controls be tested following the manufacturer’s instruction at the frequency noted below.

Each time a new lot of Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test kits is received.   
Each time a new shipment of Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test kits is received even if it is the same lot previously received.   
Each time a new operator is performing the test (i.e., operator who has not performed the test before).   
When problems (storage, operator, instrument, or other) are suspected or identified. If otherwise required by your institution’s standard Quality Control (QC) procedures.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A. Analytical Performance:

The studies conducted to support the analytical performance of the Xpert Xpress CoV2/Flu/RSV plus test, performed on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems, were previously reviewed and described in K231481. In this submission, analytical studies data generated on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems were reanalyzed using the latest 6.4a GeneXpert Xpress software to assess the analytical performance on the GeneXpert Xpress System.

The results from the analysis are described in sections below.

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility

# a. Within-laboratory Precision

Within-laboratory precision was previously evaluated as described in K231481. A total of 687 test results (654 samples and 33 controls) were processed with the GeneXpert Xpress software version 6.4a. In all cases, the runs gave the same results as described in K231481.

The reanalysis of the data from the within-laboratory precision study demonstrates equivalent performance of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test on the GeneXpert Xpress System.

# b. Reproducibility

A blinded, multi-site reproducibility study was conducted to assess the total variability of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test on the GeneXpert Xpress System across operators, study sites, testing days, runs and instruments. The reproducibility study design incorporated two contrived reproducibility panels consisting of five panel members each as indicated in Table 1.

# LoD in Clinical ANS in UTM/VTM Matrix

The LoD in clinical ANS in UTM/VTM was previously established as described in K231481 in two steps. First, 3064 tests from the LoD estimation in clinical ANS in UTM/VTM matrix were reanalyzed using the latest 6.4a GeneXpert Xpress software. There were 3040 valid results and 24 non-determinate results. All 3040 valid tests gave the exact same test results after the reanalysis. The number of non-determinate results was unchanged, and ten "NO RESULT" messages and 14 "ERROR" messages remained unchanged, after the reanalysis.

Then, 765 tests from the LoD verification in clinical ANS in UTM/VTM matrix in K231481 were reanalyzed using the latest 6.4a GeneXpert Xpress software. There were 760 valid results and 5 non-determinate results. All 760 valid tests gave the exact same test results after the reanalysis. The number of non-determinate results was unchanged, and five “ERROR” messages remained unchanged, after the analysis.

The reanalysis of the data from the LoD in clinical ANS in UTM/VTM matrix studies from K231481 demonstrates equivalent performance of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test on the GeneXpert Xpress System.

The LoD concentrations and mean Ct values at the LoDs for clinical ANS in UTM/VTM specimens tested using two reagent lots are shown in Table 4.

# B. Clinical Studies:

Prospective Clinical Study:

The performance of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus on the GeneXpert Xpress System was established in a multi-site prospective clinical study that included 23 geographically diverse sites in the United States (US) in specimens collected from individuals showing signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. Of the 23 sites, 22 performed GeneXpert Xpress System testing and specimen collection, and one site performed comparator testing and discrepant investigation.

Prospectively collected, fresh (Category I) and frozen (Category II) nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and anterior nasal swab (ANS) specimens in UTM/VTM, from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory viral infection, were enrolled from January 24, 2022 to July 19, 2022 in the US in an all-comers fashion. In addition, frozen NPS and ANS specimens in UTM/VTM that were prospectively collected from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory viral infection during the 2016-2017 influenza season in the US in an all-comers fashion (Category II specimens) were also enrolled in the prospective clinical study to assess performance for the influenza A, influenza B, and RSV analytes.

Subject/Specimen Enrollment

Specimens tested for the SARS-CoV-2 Analyte

There were 3807 prospective subjects/specimens enrolled for evaluating the performance of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus on the GeneXpert Xpress System in testing for the SARSCoV-2 analyte. Six participants withdrew after enrollment without providing specimens resulting in a total of 3801 subjects/specimens (1888 NPS and 1913 ANS). Seventy-five (75) specimens were excluded (39 NPS and 36 ANS) as a result of not meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria or as a result of an issue with informed consent documentation resulting in 3726 eligible specimens (1849 NPS and 1877 ANS). A further 392 specimens (194 NPS and 198 ANS) were excluded due to protocol deviations leaving 3334 specimens (1655 NPS and 1679 ANS). Unresolved repeat non-determinate (ND) for GeneXpert Xpress System testing resulted in the exclusion of 18 additional samples (3 NPS and 15 ANS) from performance assessment, leaving 3316 specimens (1652 NPS and 1664 ANS). Finally, 169 specimens (87 NPS and 82 ANS) were excluded from performance assessment due to non-evaluable/invalid comparator test results, leaving 3147 prospective specimens (1565 NPS and 1582 ANS, Category I and II) eligible for performance evaluation.

Specimens tested for the influenza A, influenza B, and RSV Analytes

There were 5166 prospective subjects/specimens enrolled for evaluating the performance of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus on the GeneXpert Xpress System in testing for the Flu A/ Flu B/ RSV analytes. Six participants withdrew after enrollment without providing specimens resulting in a total of 5160 subjects/specimens. Seventy-five (75) specimens were excluded (39 NPS and 36 ANS) as a result of not meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria or as a result of an issue with informed consent documentation resulting in 5085 eligible specimens (2571 NPS and 2514 ANS). An additional 524 specimens (271 NPS and 253 ANS) were excluded due to protocol deviations leaving 4561 specimens (2300 NPS and 2261 ANS) eligible for performance assessment. Table 5 describes demographic data for the prospective specimens available for performance assessments. Of the 4561 specimens remaining, a further 26 samples (7 NPS and 19 ANS) were excluded from performance analysis due to unresolved ND (repeat ND or missing repeat testing results) for GeneXpert Xpress System testing. This left 4535 specimens for performance analysis (2293 NPS and 2242 ANS). Finally, 225 additional specimens (118 NPS and 107 ANS) were excluded from performance analysis due to non-evaluable/invalid comparator test results. This resulted in 4310 specimens (2175 NPS and 2135 ANS) eligible for performance evaluation.

The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test on the GeneXpert Xpress System was evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 performance by comparing to a U.S. FDA-cleared molecular respiratory panel that includes SARS-CoV-2. For SARS-CoV-2 performance evaluations, only the prospective specimens collected in 2022 were tested with the SARS-CoV-2 comparator, as specimens collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., 2016-2017) were assumed to be SARS-CoV-2 negative.

The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test on the GeneXpert Xpress System was evaluated for Flu A, Flu B, and RSV performance by comparing to a U.S. FDA-cleared molecular Flu A/B/RSV assay. For Flu A, Flu B and RSV performance assessment, prospective specimens collected in both 2022 and 2016-2017 were evaluated.

Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) was calculated as $1 0 0 \% \times \left( \mathrm { T P } / \left( \mathrm { T P } + \mathrm { F N } \right) \right)$ . True positive (TP) indicates that both the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus and the comparator method had a positive result for the specific analyte, and false negative (FN) indicates that the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus was negative while the comparator result was positive. Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) was calculated as $1 0 0 \% \times \left( \mathrm { T N / \left( T N + F P \right) } \right)$ . True negative (TN) indicates that both the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus and the comparator method had negative results, and false positive (FP) indicates that the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus was positive while the comparator result was negative. Specimens that obtained discordant SARS-CoV-2 results underwent additional testing with a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2 molecular test, while specimens that obtained discordant Flu A, Flu B, or RSV results underwent additional testing with a U.S. FDA-cleared molecular respiratory panel.

# Non-determinate rates

The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test on the GeneXpert Xpress System non-determinate (ND) rate for prospective specimens (Category I and II) collected in 2022 and 2016-2017, combined, was initially $2 . 7 \%$ (123/4561) and decreased to $0 . 6 \%$ (26/4561) upon retest.

For NPS specimens, the initial ND result was $2 . 5 \%$ (58/2300) and decreased to $0 . 3 \%$ (7/2300) upon retest. With ANS specimens, the initial ND was $2 . 9 \%$ (65/2261) and, upon retest, was decreased to $0 . 8 \%$ (19/2261).

For fresh vs frozen, the initial ND rate for fresh specimens was $2 . 7 \%$ (90/3333) and decreased to $0 . 5 \%$ (18/3333) with retesting. For frozen specimens, the initial ND rate was $2 . 7 \%$ (33/1228) and it decreased to $0 . 7 \%$ (8/1228) with retesting.

# Multi-target Detection

The number of specimens with positive results for one or more target analyte by the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus and/or comparator assay(s) is presented in Table 8 and Table 9, where bolded values indicate concordant results. As shown in Table 8, a total of 3028 prospective specimens collected in 2022 yielded valid results for all four targets for both the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus and comparator assays. Note that influenza B is not presented in Table 8, as no influenza B positives were obtained during the 2022 study. The rate of coinfection for Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus was $0 . 1 \%$ (1/797) and the rate of co-infection by the comparators was $0 . 3 \%$ (2/774). In total, 2 co-infections were detected by either the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test or the comparator assays for specimens collected in 2022. One of these co-infections was discordant between the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus and the comparator assays (see Table 8).
