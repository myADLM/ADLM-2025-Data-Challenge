# II Submission/Device Overview:

# A Purpose for Submission:

To expand the Intended Use of the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay, which was originally FDA-cleared under K222736 for use with nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens in UTM/VTM or eSTM (RespDirect). In K241240, the intended use was expanded to include testing of anterior nasal (AN) swab specimens in UTM/VTM. This current submission includes testing of AN swab specimens that are collected with the Hologic RespDirect Collection Kit and eluted in eSTM media.

# B Measurand:

The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay detects SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus RNA isolated from NPS specimens and AN swab specimens from individuals with signs and symptoms of a respiratory tract infection.

# C Type of Test:

This assay is a multiplexed nucleic acid test that detects and differentiates SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and RSV through nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and detection using real-time RT-PCR. All steps of the assay are automated, after the manual addition of sample into the sample lysis tube (SLT) and performed within the Panther and Panther Fusion system.

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay is a fully automated multiplexed real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in vitro diagnostic test intended for the qualitative detection and differentiation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza A virus (Flu A), influenza B virus (Flu B), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Nucleic acids are isolated and purified from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens and anterior nasal (AN) swab specimens obtained from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of a respiratory tract infection. Clinical signs and symptoms of respiratory viral infection due to SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV can be similar. This assay is intended to aid in the differential diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B, and RSV infections in humans and is not intended to detect influenza C virus infections.

Nucleic acids from the viral organisms identified by this test are generally detectable in NP and AN swab specimens during the acute phase of infection. The detection and identification of specific viral nucleic acids from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection are indicative of the presence of the identified virus and aids in diagnosis if used in conjunction with other clinical and epidemiological information, and laboratory findings. The results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decisions.

Positive results do not rule out coinfection with other organisms. The organism(s) detected by the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay may not be the definite cause of disease. Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, or RSV infections. This assay is designed for use on the Panther Fusion system.

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Rx - For Prescription Use Only For in vitro diagnostic use only

D Special Instrument Requirements: For use with the Panther Fusion System, only.

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay is a multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) in vitro diagnostic test developed for use on the fully automated. Panther Fusion system to detect and differentiate SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) directly from nasopharyngeal and anterior nasal swab specimens.

The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay cartridge contains the same sample preparation and PCR reaction chemistry as the previously cleared Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV assay (K171963). To accommodate addition of the SARS-CoV-2 reagents (primers/probes) to the multiplexed reagents, minor changes were made to the previously cleared analyte primer/probe concentrations and RFU cutoffs. Additionally, the fluorophore for Flu B was changed from ROX to RED647 to accommodate the addition of SARS-CoV-2 to the assay.

The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay involves the following steps:

a. Sample lysis - Prior to processing and testing on the Panther Fusion system, specimens are transferred to a Specimen Lysis Tube (SLT) containing specimen transport media (STM). Alternatively, samples can be collected with the RespDirect Collection kit which contains enhanced specimen transport media (eSTM). STM and eSTM lyse the cells, release target nucleic acid and protect them from degradation during storage.

b. Nucleic acid capture and elution - These steps take place in a single tube on the Panther Fusion system. The eluate is transferred to the Panther Fusion system reaction tube containing the assay reagents. The Internal Control-S (IC-S) is added to each test specimen and controls via the working Panther Fusion Capture Reagent-S (wFCR-S). The IC-S in the reagent is used to monitor specimen processing, amplification, and detection. Magnetic particles with covalently bound oligonucleotides mediate the nucleic acid capture. Capture oligonucleotides hybridize to total nucleic acid in the test specimen. Hybridized nucleic acid is then separated from the lysed specimen in a magnetic field. Wash and aspiration steps remove extraneous components debris from the reaction tube. The elution step elutes purified nucleic acid.

c. Elution transfer and multiplex RT-PCR - Eluted nucleic acid is transferred to a Panther Fusion reaction tube already containing oil and reconstituted master mix. A reverse transcriptase generates a DNA copy of the target sequence. Target specific forward and reverse primers and probes then amplify targets while simultaneously detecting and discriminating multiple target types via multiplex RT-PCR. The Panther Fusion system compares the fluorescence signal to a predetermined cut-off to produce a qualitative result for the presence or absence of the analyte. The positive result for each analyte will be accompanied by the cycle threshold (Ct value).

# Hologic RespDirect Collection Kit

An ancillary collection kit that consists of the RespDirect Swab, intended for collection of NP swab and AN swab specimens, and the enhanced Direct Load Tube (eDLT), containing enhanced specimen transport media (eSTM). This transport media lyses cells, releasing target nucleic acids and protects them from degradation during storage.

# B Principle of Operation:

The assay detects viral nucleic acids that have been extracted from a patient respiratory sample (i.e., NPS or AN swab specimens). A multiplex real-time RT-PCR reaction is carried out under optimized conditions generating amplicons for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and RSV. The Internal Control-S (IC-S) is added to each test specimen before processing to act as a control for specimen processing, amplification, and detection. Identification of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, RSV, and the IC-S occurs using target-specific primers and fluorescent-labeled probes that hybridize to conserved regions in the viral genomes (Table 1).

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

Since the initial clearance of the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay (K222736), an Adaptive Crosstalk Correction (ACC) factor was implemented in the Assay Definition Module (ADM) software (K241240). No further device modifications have been introduced.

For those studies originally performed in K222736 and subsequently in K241240, there have been no device changes. Since there were no modifications to the assay (e.g., test reagent formulation, software, etc.), it was unnecessary to repeat several of the studies performed in support of K222736 or K241240.

# C Clinical Studies:

1. Clinical Sensitivity:

Prospective Study to Expand the Intended Use to Include an AN swab specimens collected using RespDirect Collection Kit in eSTM media Specimen Claim The clinical performance of the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay was established in a multi-center study conducted with two patient-matched paired AN swab specimens that were prospectively collected (i.e., all comers between two time points who meet the inclusion criteria) from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infections from January 2023 to May 2023. One AN swab specimen was collected using the RespDirect Collection Kit with eSTM media for candidate device testing and the other AN swab specimen was collected using a synthetic flocked swab by a healthcare professional (HCP) and eluted in UTM/VTM for comparator testing. The collection order for candidate and comparator specimens was randomized. AN swab specimens from nine geographically diverse clinical sites in the U.S. were enrolled and tested fresh (Category I specimens) or frozen (Category II specimens) with the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay at three U.S. testing sites.

The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay was evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 performance by comparing the candidate device testing results to a composite comparator algorithm (CCA) consisting of three highly sensitive U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests. A final CCA result was assigned when two of the three comparator assays were in concordance. The comparator method utilized to establish performance for the Flu A, Flu B, and RSV targets was a U.S. FDA-cleared molecular Flu A/B/RSV assay. All comparator testing was performed in accordance with the respective package inserts at one central laboratory.

A total of 1033 subjects (each providing patient-matched paired AN swab specimens) were acquired and enrolled for the prospective clinical study. Of these 1033 subjects, four were withdrawn because they did not meet the study eligibility criteria, leaving 1029 subjects. Of these 1029 subjects, 7 had their AN swab specimens excluded because they had an invalid candidate device result upon retesting and one specimen was withdrawn because the incorrect sample tube was used. Of the evaluable specimens, 1011 were test fresh (Category I specimens) with the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay and 10 were frozen (Category II specimens) prior to testing. Furthermore, two specimens were excluded for SARS-CoV-2 performance analysis due to invalid or inconclusive CCA results. This left 1019 prospective AN swab specimens (1009 fresh, 10 frozen) with evaluable results for SARS-CoV-2 and 1021 AN swab specimens (1011 fresh, 10 frozen) with evaluable results for Flu A, Flu B, and RSV.

Of the 1033 subjects enrolled in the study, 1032 had their AN swab specimens tested with the candidate device. Eleven (11) of these specimens were invalid by the candidate device during testing, for an initial invalid rate of $1 . 1 \%$ (11/1032). Upon retesting, the invalid rate decreased to $0 . 7 \%$ (7/1032).

Table 2 provides a summary of demographic information for the 1021 evaluable specimens included in the prospective clinical study.

A summary of the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay prospective clinical study performance is provided in Table 3.

Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) was calculated as $1 0 0 \% \times \left( \mathrm { T P } / \left( \mathrm { T P } + \mathrm { F N } \right) \right)$ . True positive (TP) indicates that both the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay and the comparator method had a positive result for the specific analyte, and false negative (FN) indicates that the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay was negative while the comparator result was positive. Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) was calculated as $1 0 0 \% \times \mathrm { ( T N / ( T N + F P ) ) }$ . True negative (TN) indicates that both the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay and the comparator method had negative results, and false positive (FP) indicates that the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay was positive while the comparator result was negative.

Specimens that obtained discordant results for SARS-CoV-2 underwent additional testing with two U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests, and discordant results for Flu A, Flu B or RSV underwent additional testing with a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV molecular test, when sufficient sample volume remained.

TP – true positive; FN – false negative; TN – true negative; FP – false positive; NC – Not calculable 1Seven (7) specimens with false positive SARS-CoV-2 results had sufficient sample volume remaining for discordant testing. All were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by two different U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests. 2The specimen with a false positive Flu A result was negative for Flu A by a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV molecular test. 3The specimen with a false negative Flu B result was negative for Flu B by a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV molecular test. 4Both specimens with false positive Flu B results were negative for Flu B by a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV molecular test. 5The specimen with a false positive RSV result was negative for RSV by a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV molecular test.

The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay reported one prospective, evaluable AN swab specimen in eSTM (RespDirect) with a co-infection $0 . 1 \%$ of all prospective specimens, 1/1021). The co-infection contained two pathogens, SARS-CoV-2 and Flu B. The sample was negative for all analytes by the comparator methods.

Data for prospective clinical study conducted with NP swab specimens and AN swab specimens in UTM/VTM are presented in the Decision Summaries for K222736 and K241240.

# Supplemental Clinical Data for Low Prevalence Analytes (Category III Specimens)

Flu A, Flu B and RSV were of lower prevalence and were not encountered in sufficiently large numbers during the prospective clinical study to adequately demonstrate assay performance with AN swab specimens collected with the RespDirect Collection Kit in eSTM media. To supplement the results of the prospective clinical study, an enrichment phase of the study was initiated which enrolled only symptomatic individuals who had obtained a Flu A, Flu B and/or RSV positive molecular standard of care (SOC) test within five days of enrollment. Enrichment occurred from October 2023- February 2024. One AN swab specimen was collected using the RespDirect Collection Kit with eSTM media for candidate device testing and the other AN swab specimen was collected using a synthetic flocked swab by a healthcare professional (HCP) and eluted in UTM/VTM for comparator testing. The collection order for candidate and comparator specimens was randomized. AN swab specimens from six geographically diverse clinical sites in the U.S. were enrolled and frozen prior to testing with the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay at one U.S. testing site. The same U.S. FDA-cleared molecular Flu A/B/RSV assay was used as the comparator method; SARS-CoV-2 was not evaluated during the enrichment phase of the study.

A total of 210 subjects (each providing patient-matched paired AN swab specimens) were acquired and enrolled for the enrichment phase of the clinical study. Of these 210 subjects, five were withdrawn because they did not meet the study eligibility criteria, and one additional subject chose to withdraw from the study leaving a total of 204 evaluable AN swab specimens in eSTM (RespDirect) from the enrichment phase.

Of the 210 subjects enrolled in the study, 205 had their AN swab specimens tested with the candidate device. Two (2) of these specimens were invalid by the candidate device during testing, for an initial invalid rate of $1 . 0 \%$ (2/205). Upon retesting, the invalid rate decreased to $0 \%$ (0/205).

Table 4 provides a summary of demographic information for the 204 evaluable specimens included in the enrichment phase of the clinical study.

TP – true positive; FN – false negative; TN – true negative; FP – false positive 1All samples enrolled in the enrichment study were SOC positive for Flu A, Flu B, and/or RSV. The NPA for the enrichment study was calculated using results from all evaluable samples with a negative comparator result for the analyte of interest. 2Both specimens with false negative Flu A results were positive for Flu A by a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV molecular test.

$^ { 3 } \mathrm { O n e }$ (1) of the 9 samples with a false positive Flu A results was positive for Flu A by a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV molecular test and 8 of the 9 samples were negative for Flu A.

4The sample with a false negative Flu B result was negative for Flu B by a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV molecular test.

5The sample with a false positive Flu B result was positive for Flu B by a by a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV molecular test.

6The sample with a false negative RSV result was negative for RSV by a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV molecular test.

7One (1) of the 6 samples with a false positive RSV results was positive for RSV by a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV molecular test and 5 of the 6 samples were negative for RSV.

As shown in Table 6, the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay reported 7 evaluable AN swab specimens in eSTM (RespDirect) in the enrichment phase with coinfections $3 . 4 \%$ of all enriched specimens, 7/204). All co-infections contained two pathogens, 4 contained Flu A and RSV, one contained SARS-CoV-2 and Flu A, one contained SARS-CoV-2 and RSV and one contained Flu B and RSV. For the candidate results that were positive for Flu A and RSV, the comparator method did not detect RSV in two of the samples. The U.S. FDA cleared molecular assay used for the comparator for Flu A, Flu B and RSV does not detect SARS-CoV-2; therefore, co-infections detected by the candidate device that contained SARS-CoV-2 could not be confirmed.
