All medical devices, including Class I and unclassified devices and combination product device constituent parts are required to be in compliance with the final Unique Device Identification System rule ("UDI Rule"). The UDI Rule requires, among other things, that a device bear a unique device identifier (UDI) on its label and package (21 CFR 801.20(a)) unless an exception or alternative applies (21 CFR 801.20(b)) and that the dates on the device label be formatted in accordance with 21 CFR 801.18. The UDI Rule (21 CFR 830.300(a) and 830.320(b)) also requires that certain information be submitted to the Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID) (21 CFR Part 830 Subpart E). For additional information on these requirements, please see the UDI System webpage at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-advicecomprehensive-regulatory-assistance/unique-device-identification-system-udi-system.

Device Name BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP)

Indications for Use (Describe)

The BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) is a qualitative multiplexed nucleic acid-based in vitro diagnostic test intended for use with the BioCode MDx 3000 Instrument. The BioCode GPP is capable of the simultaneous detection and identification of nucleic acids from multiple bacteria, viruses, and parasites extracted directly from unpreserved stool samples or stool preserved in Cary-Blair transport medium obtained from individuals with signs and/or symptoms of gastrointestinal infection. The following bacteria, parasites, and viruses are identified using the BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel:

Campylobacter (C. jejuni/C. coli)   
Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) toxin A/B (Fresh samples only)   
Salmonella spp   
Vibrio (V. parahaemolyticus/V. vulnificus/ V. cholerae), including specific identification of Vibrio parahaemolyticus   
Yersinia enterocolitica   
Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC)   
Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) lt/st   
E. coli O157 serogroup   
Shiga-like toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) stx1/stx2   
Shigella/ Enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC)   
Cryptosporidium spp (C. parvum/C. hominis)   
Entamoeba histolytica   
Giardia lamblia (also known as G. intestinalis and G. duodenalis)   
Adenovirus F 40/41   
Norovirus GI/GII   
Rotavirus A

The BioCode GPP is indicated as an aid in the diagnosis of specific agents of gastrointestinal illness and results are meant to be used in conjunction with other clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological data. For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only. For Prescription Use Only.

Positive results do not rule out co-infection with organisms not included in the BioCode GPP. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of the disease. Negative results in the setting of clinical illness compatible with gastroenteritis may be due to infection by pathogens that are not detected by this test or non-infectious causes such as ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, or Crohn’s disease. Concomitant culture is necessary for organism recovery and further typing of bacterial agents. This device is not intended to monitor or guide treatment for C. difficile infection.

Due to the small number of positive specimens collected for certain organisms during the prospective clinical study, performance characteristics for Adenovirus 40/41, Campylobacter, E. coli O157, Shigella/EIEC, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Giardia lamblia were established additionally with retrospective clinical specimens. Performance characteristics for Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, Yersinia enterocolitica and Vibrio (V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus, and V. cholerae) were established primarily using contrived clinical specimens.

# Device Description [807.92(a)(4)]

The BioCode $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) is a multiplexed nucleic acid-based test designed to be used with the BioCode MDx-3000 system. The BioCode MDx-3000 is an automated system that integrates PCR amplification, target capture, signal generation and optical detection for multiple gastrointestinal pathogens from a single stool specimen, either unpreserved or in Cary Blair. Stool specimens are processed, and nucleic acids extracted with easyMAG, MagNA Pure 96, KingFisher Flex and KingFisher Apex Dx. Once the PCR plate is set up and sealed, all other operations are automated on MDx-3000. The BioCode MDx-3000 Gastrointestinal Infection Panel simultaneously tests for 17 pathogens (see table below) from unpreserved stool specimens or stool collected in Cary-Blair transport medium. Results from the BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) test are available within less than 4 hours.

# REPRODUCIBILITY STUDY

A study was performed to assess the Reproducibility of the BioCode $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ GPP using samples extracted with the KingFisher Flex and KingFisher Apex Dx. This study was designed to assess intra-assay (within run), Inter-assay (run-to-run), day-to-day and instrument-to-instrument (operator-to-operator) reproducibility. One lot of reagents was assayed at Applied BioCode on 3 instruments by 3 operators, 2 runs per day per operator for 5 days (total of 30 runs).

Organisms were diluted in Cary-Blair, and pools were constructed in Cary Blair media at 15X or 30X LoD. The prepared pools were then diluted 1:10 fold in pre-screened negative stool, frozen over night or longer, extracted in triplicate and assayed in singlicate. In total 30 sets of RP pools were run in singlicate on 3 instruments by 3 operators over 5 days.

# LIMIT OF DETECTION (LoD)

A study was performed to assess the performance of the BioCode GPP on the BioCode MDx3000 at the Limit of Detection (LoD) for both unpreserved Stool and Cary-Blair specimens. In this study the GI Panel was tested with quantified bacteria, virus or parasite stocks (except norovirus which used clinical samples). For initial screening, four replicates of each concentration (near LoD for the predicate) in negative stool and Cary-Blair were extracted on the easyMAG, the KingFisher Flex and the KingFisher Apex Dx and tested in singlet with the BioCode $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ GPP on the BioCode MDx-3000 system. The LoD was confirmed by extracting 20 replicates of each sample type/extraction method and testing each in singlet for a total of 20 replicates at or near presumptive LoD. LoD for each stock was defined as the lowest concentration with $2 9 5 \%$ detection of 20 replicates (19 out of 20), and was determined separately unpreserved stool and Cary-Blair preserved stool. The LoDs determined from the quantitated stocks or clinical samples are presented below and in the labeling. The LoDs were the same or within 3-fold for each extraction system with a few notable exceptions identified in the tables with footnotes.

For Norovirus GI and GII targets, positive clinical specimens were used, and serial dilutions (initial 10-fold dilution series followed by finer dilutions) were performed. Four replicates of each dilution in negative unpreserved stool and Cary-Blair stool were extracted with the easyMAG, the KingFisher Flex and KingFisher Apex Dx and tested with the BioCode $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ GPP on the BioCode MDx-3000 system. The LoD was confirmed by extracting 20 replicates of each sample type with each extraction method and testing at or near presumptive LoD.

For Norovirus, the LoD of the Norovirus GII in unpreserved stool was equivalent for three extraction systems. For Norovirus GI, the KingFisher Flex is 10-fold and 3-fold more sensitive than the easyMag and the KingFisher Apex Dx, respectively. For Cary-Blair stool, the LoD of the Norovirus GI was equivalent for three systems. For Norovirus GII, the KingFisher Apex Dx was 3-fold more sensitive than the EasyMag and the KingFisher Flex.

# METHOD COMPARISON STUDY

A clinical investigational study was performed in which a total of 468 remnant, de-identified samples (254 frozen unpreserved stool and 214 inoculated Cary-Blair stool) that were prospectively collected for the clinical study that resulted in the K180041 BioCode® GPP FDA clearance were extracted using the KingFisher Flex, KingFisher Apex Dx, and the easyMAG, and tested on the MDx-3000 system. Fifty-four (54) freshly collected leftover samples were used for the $C .$ . difficile testing. In addition, a total of 120 samples were contrived at 3x LoD and 6x LoD (15 samples at 3x LoD and 15 samples at 6xLoD for each of three targets) and tested to determine the performance characteristics for Entamoeba histolytica, Yersinia enterocolitica and Vibrio spp. (V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus, and V. cholerae). The demographics of the clinical patients and the results of the clinical investigational study are as follows:

The Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) was calculated as $\mathrm { T P / ( T P + F N ) }$ . $\mathrm { T P } =$ true positive or positive by both the EasyMag and the KingFisher Apex Dx or the KingFisher Flex; $\mathrm { F N } =$ false negative or negative by the KingFisher Apex Dx or the KingFisher Flex only. Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) was calculated as $\mathrm { T N } / ( \mathrm { T N } + \mathrm { F P } )$ . $\mathrm { T N } =$ true negative or negative by the EasyMag and the KingFisher Apex Dx or the KingFisher Flex; $\mathrm { F P = }$ false positive or positive by the KingFisher Apex Dx or the KingFisher Flex only. The exact binomial two-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence interval was calculated.

\*Positive agreement $- 9 0 \%$ .

Thirty-five (35) archived samples with discordant results (between the easyMAG and KingFisher Flex) retested twice with both easyMAG and KingFisher Flex.

a - Campylobacter spp. One (1) false positive retested remained false positive whereas two (2) false positives became true negatives. Twelve (12) samples were still invalid, not used in the agreement calculation.

b - Clostridium difficile. Two (2) false positives retested remained false positives. Of the four (4) false negatives retested, three (3) became true negatives whereas one (1) remained false negative. Ten (10) samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation.

c- E. coli O157: Thirteen (13) samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation.

d - EAEC: Of the two (2) false negatives retested, one (1) was true negative and one (1) became true positive. Twelve (12) samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation.

e- ETEC: Thirteen (13) samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation.

f - STEC: Two (2) false negatives retested became true negatives. One (1) false positive became false negative. Twelve (12) samples were still invalid, not used in the agreement calculation.

g - Salmonella spp. Of the two (2) false positives retested, one (1) became true negative and one (1) remained false positive. Thirteen (13) samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation.

h - Shigella/EIEC. The false positive retested became true positive. Twelve (12) samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation.

i- Vibrio parahaemolyticus: Thirteen (13) samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation. j – Vibrio spp. One (1) false positive retested became true negative. For the false negative retested, the easyMAG had an invalid result with the $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ run and a negative result with the $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ run, whereas the KF Flex had negative results with both runs. Thirteen (13) samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation.

k – Yersinia enterocolitica: Of the (2) false positives retested, one (1) became true negative and one (1) remained false positive. Thirteen (13) samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation. l- Cryptosporidium spp: Eleven (11) samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation. m- Entamoeba histolytica: Thirteen (13) samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation. n- Giardia lamblia: Thirteen (13) samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation o - Adenovirus 40/41: The false negative and the false positive retested became true negative and true positive, respectively. Thirteen (13) samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation. p – Norovirus GI/GII: The false positive and the false negative retested became true negative and true positive, respectively. Eleven (11) samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation. q- Rotavirus: Of the ten (10) false positives retested, six (6) became true negatives, and four (4) remained false positives. Twelve (12) samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation.

The table below (Table 12) shows the results of retesting samples with discordant results between the easyMAG and the KingFisher Flex. Samples were retested twice with both easyMAG and/or KingFisher Flex. Consensus results of the discordant samples were not used in the calculation of the agreements but noted as the footnotes of Table 11 above.

Note. Fifty-four (54) fresh unpreserved $C .$ . difficile positives and negatives were tested. C. difficile positive sample TRI_047A tested $C .$ . difficile positive but was invalid for all other targets (due to invalid

RNA IC, invalid results not calculated in negative agreement). Sample remained invalid after reflex testing per BioCode GPP IFU.

a. C. difficile negative sample TRI_017A had a MFI of 516 $( > 5 0 0$ cutoff) for Campylobacter spp. The sample was Campylobacter spp negative after being retested twice with each extraction system.

b. Sample TRI_056A resulted in a false positive agreement and remained false positive after discordant analysis.

Note. One hundred twenty (120) contrived samples were tested. Five (5) samples were invalid with the easyMAG on initial testing. When the invalid samples were tested again with PCR, the samples remained invalid.

a- Of the five (5) invalids, one (1) of the $E$ . histolytica positives was tested E. his positive but RNA IC was invalid.

b- Of the five (5) invalids, one (1) of the Yersinia enterocolitica positives was tested Yersinia enterocolitica, but RNA IC was invalid.

c - One (1) of the negative stools being used as matrix for contriving samples was a low-positive $C .$ . difficile and erroneously enrolled as a negative sample. Because the C. difficile was not intended as part of the study, the positive agreement calculation for this target was not included.

Note. Fifty-four (54) fresh unpreserved samples were tested. Two (2) C. difficile positives (TRI_047A and TRI_059A) were tested C. difficile positive but invalid for all other targets (due to invalid RNA IC, invalid results not calculated in negative agreement). Samples remained invalid after reflex testing per GPP IFU.

a. C. difficile negative sample TRI_017A had a MFI of 516 ${ > } 5 0 0$ cutoff) for Campylobacter spp. The sample was Campylobacter spp negative after being retested twice with each extraction system.

b. C. difficile positive sample TRI_011A initially tested as false negative resulted in a true positive after retesting. The Xpert C. difficile-Epi test results of TRI- 011A had Ct 34.8 which indicates the sample was low positive.

Note. One hundred twenty (120) contrived samples were tested. Five (5) samples were invalid with the easyMAG on initial testing. When the invalid samples were tested again with PCR, the samples remained invalid.

a- Of the five (5) invalids, one of the $E .$ . histolytica positives was tested E. his positive but RNA IC was invalid.

b- Of the five (5) invalids, one of the Yersinia enterocolitica positives was tested Yersinia enterocolitica, but RNA IC was invalid.

c - One (1) of negative stools being used as matrix for contriving samples was a low-positive C. difficile and erroneously enrolled as a negative sample. Because the C. difficile was not intended as part of the study, the positive agreement calculation for this target was not included.

# Conclusions [807.92(b)(3):

The intended use and fundamental scientific technology of the BioCode GPP using the KingFisher Flex and KingFisher Apex Dx is substantially equivalent to the predicate device. Non-clinical studies and clinical studies have established that the BioCode GPP with the KingFisher Flex and KingFisher Apex Dx is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
