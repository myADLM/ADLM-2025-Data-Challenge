# C Type of Test:

Qualitative multiplexed nucleic acid-based test

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) is a qualitative multiplexed nucleic acidbased in vitro diagnostic test intended for use with the BioCode MDx 3000 Instrument. The BioCode GPP is capable of the simultaneous detection and identification of nucleic acids from multiple bacteria, viruses, and parasites extracted directly from unpreserved stool samples or stool preserved in Cary-Blair transport medium obtained from individuals with signs and/or symptoms of gastrointestinal infection. The following bacteria, parasites, and viruses are identified using the BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel:

▪Campylobacter (C. jejuni/C. coli)

▪Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) toxin A/B (Fresh samples only)

▪Salmonella spp

▪Vibrio (V. parahaemolyticus/V. vulnificus/ V. cholerae), including specific identification of Vibrio parahaemolyticus

▪Yersinia enterocolitica ▪Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC)

▪Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) lt/st ▪E. coli O157 serogroup

▪Shiga-like toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) stx1/stx2 ▪Shigella/ Enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC)

▪Cryptosporidium spp (C. parvum/C. hominis)

▪Entamoeba histolytica

▪Giardia lamblia (also known as G. intestinalis and G. duodenalis)

▪Adenovirus F 40/41 ▪Norovirus GI/GII ▪Rotavirus A

The BioCode GPP is indicated as an aid in the diagnosis of specific agents of gastrointestinal illness and results are meant to be used in conjunction with other clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological data. For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only. For Prescription Use Only.

Positive results do not rule out co-infection with organisms not included in the BioCode GPP. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of the disease. Negative results in ths setting of clinical illness compatible with gastroenteritis may be due to infection by pathogens that are not detected by this test or non-infectious causes such as ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, or Crohn’s disease. Concomitant culture is necessary for organism recovery and further typing of bacterial agents. This device is not intended to monitor or guide treatment for C. difficile infection.

Due to the small number of positive specimens collected for certain organisms during the prospective clinical study, performance characteristics for Adenovirus 40/41, Campylobacter, $E$ coli O157, Shigella/EIEC, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Giardia lamblia were established additionally with retrospective clinical specimens. Performance characteristics for Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, Yersinia enterocolitica and Vibrio (V. parahaemolyticus, $V .$ . vulnificus, and V. cholerae) were established primarily using contrived clinical specimens.

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

# D Special Instrument Requirements:

For use on the MDx 3000 instrument

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) is a multiplexed nucleic acid-based test designed to be used with the BioCode MDx 3000 system. The BioCode MDx 3000 is an automated system that integrates PCR amplification, target capture, signal generation and optical detection for multiple gastrointestinal pathogens from a single stool specimen, either unpreserved or in Cary Blair. Stool specimens are processed, and nucleic acids extracted with BioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG, Roche MagNA Pure 96, or Thermo Fisher KingFisher Flex. Once the PCR plate is set up and sealed, all other operations are automated on MDx 3000. The BioCode MDx 3000 Gastrointestinal Infection Panel simultaneously tests for 17 pathogens from unpreserved stool specimens or stool collected in Cary-Blair transport medium. Results from the BioCode GPP test are available within less than 4 hours.

# B Principle of Operation:

The principle of operation of the BioCode MDx 3000 remains unchanged from the initial clearance in K180041. Refer to the published decision summary for additional information. The BioCode MDx-3000 is an automated system that integrates PCR amplification, target capture, signal generation and optical detection for multiple gastrointestinal pathogens from a single stool specimen, either unpreserved or in Cary-Blair. Stool specimens are processed and nucleic acids are extracted with either the BioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG, Roche MagNA Pure 96, or Thermo Fisher KingFisher Flex automated systems. Once the PCR plate is set up and sealed, all other operations are automated on the MDx 3000.

The BioCode MDx 3000 Software controls the operation of the instrument, collects and analyzes data, and automatically generates interpretation for test reports at the end of the run. Fluorescent signals from BMBs with the same barcode are sorted and calculated to generate median fluorescence index (MFI) for each analyte. The presence or absence of a pathogen is determined relative to the validated assay cutoff by MFI. The software also analyzes the results of external and internal controls to validate the run and individual specimen results for reporting.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

A reproducibility study was conducted to evaluate variability associated with extraction of samples with the KingFisher Flex system This study was designed to assess intra-assay (within run), Inter-assay (run-to-run), day-to-day and instrument-to-instrument (operator-tooperator) reproducibility. One lot of reagents was assayed at Applied BioCode on two instruments by three operators. Testing was performed including two runs per day per operator for five days (a total of 30 runs).

Organisms were diluted directly into Cary-Blair, and pools were constructed in Cary Blair media at 15X or 30X LoD. The prepared pools were then diluted 1:10 fold in pre-screened negative stool, frozen over night or longer, extracted in triplicate and assayed in singlicate. The reproducibility panel consisted of 7 contrived samples (sample 7 is a negative control) extracted in triplicate and each assayed in singlet. The samples consisted of combinations of 12 representative targets at $1 . 5 \mathrm { x }$ LoD (Low) and 3x LoD (Medium). Results from the study are shown in Table 1 below.

2. Linearity: Not applicable because the BioCode GPP is a qualitative assay.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference: Analytical specificity of the BioCode GPP was evaluated in the original510(k) Premarket Notification (K180041). No additional testing was conducted.

4. Assay Reportable Range: Not applicable because the BioCode GPP is a qualitative assay.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods): No modifications were made to the BioCode GPP assay or MDx 3000 instrument system. Please refer to the published decision summary for the original 510(k) submission for additional information (K180041).

# 6. Detection Limit:

The LoD of BioCode GPP assay was evaluated when the KingFisher Flex instrument was used for nucleic acid extraction. Contrived samples were prepared with the 21 quantified bacteria, virus, or parasite stocks (Table 3) as well as 1 high Norovirus GI-positive and 1 high Norovirus GII-positive clinical specimens. Each stock was serially diluted and extracted to challenge analytical sensitivity of the assay. LoD for each stock was the lowest concentration with $2 9 5 \%$ detection of 20 replicates (19 out of 20). LoD were verified for both unpreserved stool and CaryBlair preserved stool. To minimize the required volume of reagents and negative matrix and operator time, the LoD study was performed using dual analyte spiked samples. Side by side dilutions (initial 10-fold dilution series followed by finer dilutions) of the Norovirus GI and Norovirus GII clinical specimens was performed and assayed to demonstrate the equivalence between the cleared extraction platform EasyMag and KingFisher Flex.

Organism stocks were serially diluted in Cary-Blair to $1 0 \mathrm { x }$ final screening concentration and combined with prescreened negative stool or Cary-Blair stool at a 1:10 ratio at the time of extraction. Four (4) replicates of each concentration in unpreserved stool and Cary-Blair stool were extracted on the easyMAG and KingFisher Flex and tested singly with BioCode GPP assay on the BioCode MDx-3000 system to estimate LoD. The LoD was verified by extracting 20 replicates of each sample type with the easyMAG and KingFisher Flex and testing each extracted sample singly for a total of 20 replicates at or near presumptive LoD. Verification testing (20 replicates) was performed with unpreserved stool samples and Cary-Blair samples. Verification testing (20 replicates) was performed with single targets or in combination with other organism(s).

For Norovirus GI and GII targets, high positive clinical specimens were used and side by side dilutions (initial 10-fold dilution series followed by finer dilutions) was performed and assayed. Each dilution was extracted in quadruplicate with the easyMAG and KingFisher Flex and assayed singly. Twenty (20) replicates at the dilution in which all 3 replicates are detected was assayed to confirm the LoD for each of the two systems.

For Norovirus, as shown in Table 6, the LoD of the Norovirus GII in unpreserved stool was equivalent for 3 extraction systems. For Norovirus GI, the KingFisher Flex is 10-fold and 3-fold more sensitive than the easyMAG. For Cary-Blair stool, as shown in Table 7, the LoD of the Norovirus GI was equivalent for the two systems.

# 7. Assay Cut-Off:

Assay cut-off remains unchanged from the previously cleared version of the BioCode GPP panel.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

To support the performance of the Biocode GPP when used with the KingFisher Flex extraction system, a total of 468 remnant, de-identified clinical specimens (254 frozen unpreserved stool and 214 inoculated Cary-Blair stool) were evaluated with both the KingFisher Flex procedure and previously cleared methods employing the easyMAG extraction platform. These remnant samples were used to support the original 510(k) clearance of the BioCode GPP device.

Fifty-four (54) frozen unpreserved samples were used for the C. difficile testing. In addition, a total of 120 samples were contrived at 3x LoD and 6x LoD (15 samples at 3x LoD and 15 samples at 6xLoD for each of three targets) and tested to determine the performance characteristics for Entamoeba histolytica, Yersinia enlerocolitica and Vibrio spp. ( $V .$ parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus, and $V .$ . cholerae). The demographics of the enrolled subjects in the clinical study are shown in Table 8 below.

For each specimen, the results and the validity were determined per the Interpretation Algorithm of the BioCode GPP. The PPA was calculated as $\mathrm { T P / ( T P + F N ) }$ . $\mathrm { T P } =$ true positive or positive by both the EasyMag and the Kingfisher Flex; $\mathrm { F N } =$ false negative or negative by the Kingfisher Flex only. The NPA was calculated as $\mathrm { T N } / ( \mathrm { T N } + \mathrm { F P } )$ . $\mathrm { T N } =$ true negative or negative by the EasyMag and the KingFisher Flex; $\mathrm { F P = }$ false positive or positive by the KingFisher Flex only.

The PPA and NPA of the results between the KingFisher Flex and the easyMAG for individual targets for each sample type (unpreserved stool or Cary-Blair stool) and for the combined sample types plus binomial two-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence interval were calculated. The overall PPA and NPA of the results between the KingFisher Flex and the easyMAG for all targets combined for each sample type (unpreserved stool or Cary-Blair stool) and for the combined sample types plus binomial two-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence interval were calculated. The agreement for samples with co-infections were calculated separately. After discordant analysis, samples that were still invalid were excluded in the agreement calculations. The percentage of invalid samples was calculated for information only.

Note. One hundred twenty contrived samples were tested. Five samples were invalid with the easyMAG on initial testing. When the invalid samples were tested again with PCR, the samples remained invalid.

a Of the five invalids, one of the $E$ . histolytica positives was had a positive assay result for $E .$ . histolytica but the RNA internal control was invalid.

$^ \mathrm { \Delta \ b } \mathrm { O f }$ the five invalids, one had a positive assay result for Yersinia enterocolitica, but the RNA internal control was invalid.

c One of the negative stools being used as matrix for contriving samples exhibited weak positivity for C. difficile and erroneously enrolled as a negative sample. Because the C. difficile was not intended as part of the study, the positive agreement calculation for this target was not included.
