Device Name Xpert® MR.SA/SA SSTI

Indications for Use (Describe)

The Xpert $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ MR.SA/SA Skin and Soft Tissue Infection test (Xpert MR.SA/SA SSTI test) performed on the GeneXpert $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Instrument Systems is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test intended for the detection of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MR.SA) from skin and soft tissue infection swabs. The test utilizes automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect MR.SA/SA DNA. The Xpert MR.SA/SA SSTI test is indicated for use in conjunction with other laboratory tests, such as microbiology culture, and clinical data available to the clinician as an aid in the detection of MR.SA/SA from skin and soft tissue infections. The Xpert MR.SA/SA SSTI test is not intended to monitor treatment for MR.SA/SA infections. Concomitant cultures for SA and MR.SA are necessary to recover organisms for susceptibility testing or epidemiological typing. In a mixed culture containing MR.SA/SA and other organisms ( e.g., Gram-negative bacilli, yeast), results can be false negative or variable depending on the concentration of MR.SA/SA present, particularly if the concentration of MR.SA/SA is close to the limit of detection (LoD) of the test.

# 1.1 Device Description

The Xpert MRSA/SA SSTI (Xpert MRSA/SA Skin and Soft Tissue Infection) test is an automated in vitro diagnostic DNA test for the qualitative, simultaneous detection of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) directly from skin and soft tissue specimen swabs. The specimen is collected on a double swab, one of which is placed in a tube containing elution reagent. Following brief vortexing, the eluted material is transferred to a different, uniquely labeled sample chamber of a disposable fluidic cartridge (the Xpert MRSA/SA SSTI cartridge).

The test is performed on the GeneXpert® Instrument Systems (comprised of the GeneXpert® Dx System, GeneXpert® System with Touchscreen, and GeneXpert® Infinity System). In the GeneXpert® Instrument Systems, sample preparation, amplification, and real-time detection are all fully automated and completely integrated. The platform requires the use of singleuse disposable cartridges that hold the PCR reagents and host the PCR process. Because the cartridges are self-contained, cross-contamination between samples is minimized.

The user initiates a test from the system user interface of the GeneXpert® Instrument Systems platform and places the cartridge with sample into a GeneXpert® instrument system which performs hands-off real-time, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of SA and MRSA DNA.

Depending upon the specific instrument, a GeneXpert® instrument system may contain 1–80 modules, each which are randomly accessible and capable of performing separate sample preparation and real-time PCR tests. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids (i.e., the syringe drive activates the plunger that works in concert with the rotary valve in the cartridge to move fluids between chambers), an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or spores, and a proprietary $\mathrm { I C O R E } ^ { \textregistered }$ thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and detection.

The Xpert MRSA/SA SSTI test kit includes reagents for the simultaneous detection of the target organisms, SA and MRSA. The primers and probes in the Xpert MRSA/SA SSTI test detect nucleic acid sequences of the staphylococcal protein A (spa), the gene for methicillin/oxacillin resistance (mecA), and staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec) inserted in the SA chromosomal attB site.

The test includes a sample processing control (SPC) to control for adequate processing of the target bacteria and to monitor the presence of inhibitor(s) in the PCR assay. The SPC also ensures that the PCR conditions (temperature and time) are appropriate for the amplification reaction and that the PCR reagents are functional. The Probe Check Control (PCC) verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability.

The Xpert MRSA/SA SSTI test performed on the GeneXpert® Instrument Systems provides results in approximately 62 minutes.

Each instrument in the GeneXpert® instrument family is equipped with Windows OS-based personal computer preloaded with software applications for running tests and viewing the results, as described in Table 1.

# 1.3 Technical Characteristics

The Xpert MRSA/SA SSTI test has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device.

# 1.4 Substantial Equivalence

The purpose of this Special 510(k) submission is to modify the cleared, legally marketed device (Xpert MRSA/SA SSTI) to include the GeneXpert® Infinity System instruments (see Table 1 above). The Xpert MRSA/SA SSTI test was originally cleared for use on the GeneXpert® Dx System (K080837). Both the GeneXpert Dx System and the GeneXpert Infinity System are

members of the instrument family “GeneXpert® Instrument Systems” which is now incorporated in the Intended Use/Indications for Use of this device. Table 2 shows the similarities and Table 3 shows the differences between the Xpert MRSA/SA SSTI test and predicate device. The differences between Xpert MRSA/SA SSTI test and predicate device do not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness.

# 1.5 Summary of Performance Data

The performance of the Xpert MRSA/SA SSTI test when used with the GeneXpert® Infinity System instruments was assessed through verification studies, including a prepared cartridge hold time study and functional testing.

Hold time refers to the duration between the preparation of the cartridge (i.e., addition of sample) and the initiation of the test. The maximum acceptable hold time for a prepared cartridge was verified as 4 hours.

Functional testing was conducted using both contrived positive (MRSA cells added to negative matrix) and negative (negative matrix only) samples. Each target of the Xpert MRSA/SA SSTI test was analyzed, resulting in a reportable outcome. The study results showed $100 \%$ agreement of reportable results, with no statistically significant differences in Ct values observed between assay runs in instruments of the GeneXpert® Dx System and GeneXpert® Infinity System. This study demonstrated equivalent performance of the Xpert MRSA/SA SSTI test when performed on any member of the GeneXpert® Instrument Systems family.

The assessment of the results from these studies determined that the performance claims of the Xpert MRSA/SA SSTI test were not impacted by the modifications made to the predicate device.

# 1.6 Conclusion

The results of the verification studies demonstrated that the performance of the modified Xpert MRSA/SA SSTI test on the GeneXpert Infinity System is equivalent to the performance of the predicate device, the original Xpert MRSA/SA SSTI (K080837), and that the modifications proposed in the modified device have not changed the fundamental scientific technology of the predicate device.
