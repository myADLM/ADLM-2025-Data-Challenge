# III. PREDICATE DEVICE

The predicate device is the Aptima CMV Quant Assay (P210029; approved May 9, 2022), marketed as a 100-test kit configuration.

# IV. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The Aptima CMV Quant Assay is an in vitro nucleic acid amplification test that uses real-time transcription mediated amplification (TMA) technology on the Panther/Panther Fusion system to quantify CMV DNA, genotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4. The primer design targets the highly conserved UL56 gene to ensure accurate quantitation of the CMV DNA. The assay is standardized to the WHO International Standard for human cytomegalovirus. The Aptima CMV Quant Assay is intended for use to aid in the management of solid-organ transplant patients and hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients.

The addition of a protocol to treat specific plasma samples with proteinase K in the assay package insert will allow the retesting of those samples to obtain a valid result.

# Principles of the Procedure

The Aptima CMV Quant Assay is an in vitro nucleic acid amplification test that uses real-time transcription mediated amplification (TMA) technology on the Panther system\* to quantify CMV DNA, genotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4. The primer design targets the highly conserved UL56 gene to ensure accurate quantitation of the CMV DNA. The assay is standardized to the 1st WHO International Standard for human cytomegalovirus (NIBSC code: 09/162).

The Aptima CMV Quant Assay involves three main steps, which take place in a single tube on the Panther system: target capture, target amplification by TMA, and detection of the amplification products (amplicon) by the fluorescently labeled probes (torches).

During target capture, viral DNA is isolated from specimens. The specimen is treated with a detergent to solubilize the viral envelope, denature proteins, and release viral genomic DNA. Capture oligonucleotides hybridize to highly conserved regions of CMV DNA, if present, in the test specimen. The hybridized target is then captured onto magnetic microparticles that are separated from the specimen in a magnetic field. Wash steps remove extraneous components from the reaction tube.

Target amplification occurs via TMA, which is a transcription-mediated nucleic acid amplification method that utilizes two enzymes, Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase and T7 RNA polymerase. The reverse transcriptase is used to generate a DNA copy (containing a promoter sequence for T7 RNA polymerase) of the target sequence. T7 RNA polymerase produces multiple copies of RNA amplicon from the DNA copy template.

Detection is achieved using single-stranded nucleic acid torches that are present during the amplification of the target and that hybridize specifically to the amplicon in real time. Each torch has a fluorophore and a quencher. When the torch is not hybridized to the amplicon, the quencher is in close proximity of the fluorophore and suppresses the fluorescence. When the torch binds to the amplicon, the quencher is moved farther away from the fluorophore, which will emit a signal at a specific wavelength when excited by a light source. As more torches hybridize to amplicon, a higher fluorescent signal is generated. The time taken for the fluorescent signal to reach a specified threshold is proportional to the starting CMV concentration. Each reaction has an internal calibrator/internal control (IC) that controls for variations in specimen processing, amplification, and detection. The concentration of a sample is determined by the Panther system software using the CMV and IC signals for each reaction and comparing them to calibration information.

Assay results are converted from copies/mL to $\mathrm { I U / m L }$ using a conversion factor equation embedded in the Panther software.

# Assay Components

The Aptima CMV Quant Assay provides enough reagents to run 100 tests. The assay kit contains 4 boxes: Box 1, Main Assay Kit Reagents; Box 2, Target Enhancer Reagent (TER); Box 3, Calibrator Kit; and Box 4, Controls Kit. All these components are required for sample processing.

# VI. PERFORMANCE DATA

Plasma samples containing abnormally high presence of globulin proteins can coagulate on exposure to alkaline shock (addition of the Target Enhancer Reagent, a component of the assay kit) during the nucleic acid extraction step of the assay, forming a gel in the assay tube. This gel clogs the aspirators in the magnetic wash station on the Panther/Panther Fusion system, during the wash steps for nucleic acid purification, causing the instrument sensors to invalidate the results of the sample and report it with a ML2 flag. Pre-treatment of the invalidated ML2 specimens with proteinase K reagent enables generation of valid results for these specimens by digesting the proteins and preventing the formation of gels when the sample is exposed to alkaline shock.

The validated proteinase K protocol has been incorporated into the assay’s package insert as follows:

# Processing of CMV plasma specimen with an ML2 flag for retesting:

1. Allow the specimens to reach $1 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ prior to processing.   
2. Transfer $1 0 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of patient specimen into a labeled secondary tube.   
3. Add $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of proteinase $\mathrm { K }$ to aliquoted plasma specimen.   
4. Cap the labeled secondary tube.   
5. Vortex for 15 seconds.   
6. Incubate for 10 minutes at $6 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .   
7. Cool down for 1 minute at room temperature ( $1 5 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ).   
8. Briefly centrifuge the specimen to gather all droplets at the bottom of the tube before   
testing on the Panther system.

Note: After a specimen is treated with proteinase K, it should be tested immediately.

This protocol was validated using plasma specimens collected from the transplant patient population by the National Institute of Health (NIH). The prevalence of specimens invalidated with ML2 flags at the NIH decreased from $0 . 8 7 \%$ (on testing 1039 plasma specimens without proteinase K treatment) to $0 \%$ (on testing 4098 specimens with proteinase K treatment). The NIH also demonstrated that using proteinase K for pretreatment of specimens did not impact the accuracy of CMV quantification in the Aptima Assay (Youn J-H, Walker L, Carlson S, Soutar C, Frank K, Zelazny A, Das S. Mitigation of errors on an FDA-approved platform for cytomegalovirus viral load assay. J Clin Microbiol. 2024 Jul 16;62(7). The Hologic risk assessment to evaluate the impact of changing the specimen handling workflow to incorporate proteinase K pretreatment of specimens prior to performing the Aptima CMV Quant Assay concluded that the benefits provided by the updates to the Hologic specimen handling workflow at customer sites outweigh the risks.

Using this protocol will enable clinical laboratories to generate a valid result on the Panther/Panther Fusion system for plasma specimens that initially reported an invalid result with ML2 flag.

# VII. CONCLUSIONS

Implementation of pre-treatment of plasma specimens with proteinase K prior to testing in the Aptima CMV Quant Assay enables clinical laboratories to generate a valid retest result, for plasma specimens that initially reported invalid results with ML2 flag. Prompt generation of valid retest results minimizes delays in patient treatment decisions.

This protocol does not negatively impact the safety and effectiveness of the Aptima CMV Quant Assay because the assay performance characteristics including accuracy are maintained with incorporation of this modification.
