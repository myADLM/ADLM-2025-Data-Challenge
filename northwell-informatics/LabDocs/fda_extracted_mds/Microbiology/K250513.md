This Special 510(k) (K250513) describes modifications made to the IntelliSep test software and Cytovale System hardware. These modifications are described in Section 8.

# 5. Device Description

The Cytovale IntelliSep test is a short turn-around time (STAT) test, producing results in 10 minutes or less, to aid in the early detection of sepsis with organ dysfunction manifesting within the first 3 days after testing. It assesses the state of immune activation in patients with signs and symptoms of infection who present in the Emergency Department (ED).

The IntelliSep test is run on the Cytovale System, a laboratory benchtop analyzer depicted in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

To run a test, the laboratory operator transfers $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of whole blood into the sample preparation tube which is then placed into the Cytovale System. The system automatically lyses red blood cells, and washes the purified leukocytes in a diluent, producing a total volume of approximately $1 \mathrm { m L }$ of prepared sample, which the operator then transfers to the IntelliSep cartridge for analysis on the Cytovale System. A microfluidic deformability cytometry technique is used to measure the biophysical properties of thousands of individual leukocytes in rapid succession. These properties have been shown to differ in quiescent white blood cell populations when compared to those in septic patients, enabling rapid assessment of the host response and the likelihood of having sepsis with organ dysfunction manifesting within the first 3 days after testing.

Based on these measurements, the test provides a single score, the IntelliSep Index (ISI), ranging from 0.1- 10.0, stratified into three discrete interpretation bands (Band 1, Band 2, Band 3) of increasing sepsis likelihood.

# 6. Intended Use

The Cytovale IntelliSep test is a semi-quantitative test that assesses cellular host response via deformability cytometry of leukocyte biophysical properties and is intended for use in conjunction with clinical assessments and laboratory findings to aid in the early detection of sepsis with organ dysfunction manifesting within the first 3 days after testing. It is indicated for use in adult patients with signs and symptoms of infection who present to the Emergency Department. The test is performed on an EDTA anticoagulated whole blood sample.

The IntelliSep test generates an IntelliSep Index value that falls within one of three discrete interpretation bands based on the probability of sepsis with organ dysfunction manifesting within the first three days after testing. The IntelliSep test represents the probability of the clinical syndrome of sepsis and is intended to be used alongside other clinical information and clinical judgement. It does not identify the causative agent of infection and should not be used as the sole basis to determine the presence of sepsis. The IntelliSep test is intended for in vitro diagnostic use.

# 7. Indications for Use

See “Intended Use”.

# 8. Overall Comparison Between Subject Device and Predicate

This Special 510(k) (K250513) describes modifications made to the IntelliSep test software and Cytovale System hardware. There were no changes to the intended use or indications for use for the IntelliSep test, nor were there any changes to the underlying technological characteristics or principles of operation of the Cytovale System.

The modifications are described below.

# 8.1. Implementation of Optional Remote Log Export Function

The original Cytovale System (K220991) did not include an external network connection, i.e., an internet connection. The modified Cytovale System (K250513) includes an external network connection utilized to export System logs for purposes of remote troubleshooting. This remote log export is unidirectional; the Cytovale System does not accept any incoming data. There is no patient protected health information (PHI) included in the exported System logs.

This external network connection is optional and can be enabled following appropriate assessment by a customer laboratory’s Information Technology (IT) department.

# 8.2. Refinement of Internal Quality Control Metrics

The original IntelliSep test software (K220991) included internal quality control metrics to ensure the validity of IntelliSep test results. The Cytovale System will only report a test result if these internal quality control metrics are met. Otherwise, a test error is reported.

The modified IntelliSep test software (K250513) incorporates modifications to certain internal quality control metrics to refine clog detection within the IntelliSep Cartridge’s microfluidic junction and to further discern any assay failures. The modifications also establish new metrics to achieve this same goal.

The modifications are limited to the System’s evaluation of the in-process assay results and determination of assay validity. The cell deformability cytometry technique and IntelliSep result calculation process remain unchanged from K220991.

# 8.3. Additional Imaging Analysis Module Hardware Variant

The additional Imaging Analysis Module (IAM) configuration presented in K250513 was based on the original K220991 IAM configuration, with the same functional and performance requirements applied to both IAM variants.

The original hardware from the K220991 configuration was planned to be obsolesced by the workstation manufacturer, necessitating replacement of the central and graphics processing units with units of equivalent processing capabilities. Due to incidental improvements in component energy efficiency, the number of power supplies was also reduced from two (K220991) to one (K250513).

The IAM is responsible for receiving and processing data from the Cell Imaging Module (CIM) and providing assay results back to the CIM for display; no changes were made to either data interface.

# 9. Non-Clinical and/or Clinical Tests Summary & Conclusions

Verification and validation testing was successfully performed following risk assessment of the device modifications. This testing included the components listed below. No changes to assay performance or device function were observed, and no new risks were identified.

# 9.1. Cytovale System Software Verification and Validation

# 9.1.1.Holistic Assessment of All Modifications

Software supporting all three Cytovale System modules successfully completed software verification and validation. This included both verification and validation of the device modifications, and confirmation of continued System function and assay performance in alignment with final guidance Content of Premarket Submissions for Device Software Functions (June 2023).

# 9.1.2.Specific Activities for Remote Log Export Function

Specific verifications and validations were performed in acknowledgement of the new external network connection. These activities included confirmation of data integrity between the Cytovale System and the external network location, and performance of independent penetration testing to demonstrate controls against physical (kinetic) and digital cyberattacks. All activities were performed in alignment with final guidance Cybersecurity in Medical Devices: Quality System Considerations and Content of Premarket Submissions (September 2023).

# 9.2. Internal Quality Control Metrics: Comparison of Clinical and Analytical Performance Results

In accordance with the applicable special controls listed in 21 CFR 866.3215, Cytovale confirmed that the modified device maintained identical analytical and clinical performance to the cleared K220991 device. This comparison was of special concern due to the modifications to the internal quality control metrics used to determine result validity.

Raw assay videos from the following performance studies were processed on both the modified device (K250513) and the baseline device (K220991). The results were then directly compared to each other and to the original design requirements.

• IntelliSep Clinical Validation Study (CV-CLN-007)

• Within Laboratory Precision (CLSI EP05‐A3) • Reproducibility (CLSI EP05‐A3) • Healthy Reference Range (CLSI EP28-A3C)

No performance differences were observed for these data sets; there are no changes to labeled performance claims or limitations when compared to K220991. All performance claims and limitations may be found in the Decision Summary for K2209911 .

# 9.3. Internal Quality Control Metrics: Comparison of Sequestered Data Set

A comparison of results from a sequestered data set was also evaluated in conformance with Good Machine Learning Practice for Medical Device Development (October 2021) as established by the US FDA, Health Canada, and MHRA, specifically “Training Data Sets Are Independent of Test Sets”. Raw assay videos from the sequestered data set were processed on both the modified device (K250513) and the baseline device (K220991). The results were then directly compared to each other

No performance differences were observed for the sequestered data set, indicating that the device modifications will not impact future, new assay results or overall assay performance.

# 9.4. Additional Imaging Analysis Module Hardware Variant: Electrical Safety/EMI/EMC Testing

The additional IAM hardware configuration underwent electrical safety, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), and electromagnetic interference (EMI) testing per IEC 60601-1-2:2014/AMD1:2020, and applicable portions of IEC 61010-1:2010, AMD1:2016 at an ASCA-certified test site (Intertek in Menlo Park, CA, USA). Continued ETL certification and authorization to mark was obtained through this testing.

In alignment with final guidance Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) of Medical Devices (June 2022), IEC TS 60601-4-2 was successfully employed to assess the immunity of the performance associated with the device’s intended use.

# 10. Proposed Labeling

The labeling is sufficient and meets the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as applicable, and meets the special controls for this device under 21 CFR 866.3215.

# 11. Conclusions

The submitted information in this Special 510(k) notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence determination.
