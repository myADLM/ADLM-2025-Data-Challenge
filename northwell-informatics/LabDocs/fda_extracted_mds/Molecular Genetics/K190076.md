# Device Description:

The Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test is an automated in vitro diagnostic test for quantifying the amount of BCR-ABL1 (BCR-ABL, hereafter) mRNA transcript as a ratio of BCRABL/ABL per the International Scale (IS).

The test is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Dx System and GeneXpert Infinity System (referred to as the GeneXpert systems). The GeneXpert systems require the use of single-use, disposable cartridges that hold the PCR reagents and host the PCR process. Because the cartridges are self-contained and specimens never come into contact with working parts of the instrument modules, cross-contamination between samples is minimized. The GeneXpert systems have 1 to 80 randomly accessible modules, depending upon the instrument, that are each capable of performing separate sample preparation and real-time PCR and RT-PCR tests. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids (i.e., the syringe drive activates the plunger that works in concert with the rotary valve in the cartridge to move fluids between chambers), and a proprietary $\mathrm { I - C O R E } ^ { \textregistered }$ thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and RT-PCR and detection.

The Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test includes reagents to detect BCR-ABL fusion genes resulting from two major breakpoints, translocation e13a2/b2a2 and e14a2/b3a2 and the ABL transcript as an endogenous control in peripheral blood specimens. The amount of BCR-ABL transcript in the patient sample is reported as a percent ratio of BCRABL/ABL on the International Scale $( I S )$ , and also expressed as a log molecular reduction (MR value) from a baseline of $100 \%$ $( I S )$ , using the GeneXpert software.

There are two controls included in each Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test, which are the ABL Endogenous Control and the Probe Check Control (PCC). The ABL Endogenous Control normalizes the BCR-ABL target and ensures that sufficient sample is used in the test. The PCC verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling, and that all reaction components, including probes and dyes, are present and functional in the cartridge.

A description of the reagents provided in the kit is described below in Table 1.

The peripheral blood specimens are collected in EDTA blood tubes following the user institution’s standard procedures and can be stored for up to 72 hours prior to use when stored at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . The test sample, from a peripheral blood specimen, is prepared in a sample preparation tube provided with the kit, with reagents that are provided with the kit (proteinase K and lysis reagent) plus user-supplied ethanol, following instructions in the package insert. After sample preparation, the prepared sample and one reagent provided with the kit (Wash Reagent) are pipetted to separate chambers of the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra cartridge. The user initiates a test from the system user interface and places the cartridge into the GeneXpert instrument platform, which performs hands-off additional sample preparation and nested, real-time, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for detection of RNA. In this platform, the additional sample preparation, amplification, and real-time detection are all fully-automated and completely integrated. The time to result for the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test including offline sample preparation and real-time RT-qPCR is approximately 2.25 hours.

# Substantial Equivalence:

The Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra is substantially equivalent to the Asuragen QuantideX qPCR BCR-ABL IS Kit [DEN160003]. The performance of the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test was evaluated in a multi-site clinical study using whole blood specimens and was compared to a FDA-cleared molecular assay. The results from the clinical study demonstrated that the performance of Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

Table 2 shows the similarities and differences between the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test and the predicate device.

The Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test has the same general intended use as the predicate device and has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device. The differences between the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test and the predicate device do not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness. The clinical study demonstrates that the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test is acceptable for its intended use and is substantially equivalent to the predicate device described above.

# Linearity/Dynamic Range

Linearity was evaluated independently for each of the two major breakpoints, e13a2/b2a2 and e14a2/b3a2, using CML clinical specimens that were specific for a high level of either the e13a2/b2a2 or e14a2/b3a2 breakpoint. Lysate from each high level of BCRABL transcript CML specimen was diluted in a background lysate prepared from CMLnegative clinical specimen to target ranges of ${ \sim } 5 0 \%$ (IS)/MR0.30 to $0 . 0 0 0 6 2 5 \%$ (IS)/MR5.20. The panel members, including the negative level, were tested on two assay kit lots in replicates of 4 per kit lot.

Testing and statistical analyses were conducted in accordance with CLSI EP06-A. Linear regression analyses were performed for first, second and third order polynomials. The results for each breakpoint were considered linear if the polynomial regression coefficients were insignificant (p-values $> 0 . 0 5$ ). The linear regression curves for both transcripts are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 below.

![](images/3ea573f4544f4dead1345d3aa6e73478e420588684b9362a5f646d603368e381.jpg)

Collectively, the data support an observation of linearity from at least $5 5 \%$ (IS)/MR 0.26 to ${ \sim } 0 . 0 0 1 9 \%$ (IS)/MR4.75 with a maximum SD of 0.26. The reportable range spans from the limits of linearity at $5 5 \%$ (IS)/MR0.26 to the LoD/LOQ at $0 . 0 0 3 0 \%$ (IS)/MR4.52.

# Analytical Sensitivity

The limit of detection (LoD) was estimated for both e13a2/b2a2 and e14a2/b3a2 breakpoints by testing serial dilutions of High CML positive specimens $[ > 1 0 \% ( I S ) / \mathrm { M R } 1 ]$ as well as testing Low CML positive specimens $[ < 0 . 1 \% ( I S ) / \mathrm { M R } 3 ]$ . Data for each breakpoint across dilutions and specimens were separately compiled and the LoD was estimated by using probit regression analysis. The resulting analysis yielded an estimated LoD of $0 . 0 0 3 5 \%$ (IS)/MR4.45 for the e $1 3 \mathrm { a } 2 / \mathrm { b } 2 \mathrm { a } 2$ breakpoint and $0 . 0 0 3 0 \%$ (IS)/MR4.52 for the e14a2/b3a2 breakpoint.

The LoD was verified by adapting the non-parametric method described in the CLSI guidance document, EP17-A2 (Table 4). Two unique CML positive specimens representing each breakpoint were diluted to a targeted $0 . 0 0 3 0 \%$ (IS)/MR4.52 level. For e13a2/b2a2, 94 replicates were tested by 2 operators across 4 test kit lots over 4 days. For e14a2/b3a2, 101 replicates were tested by 2 operators across 4 test kit lots over 7 days.

Since the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test does not distinguish between the two breakpoints, $\mathrm { e } 1 3 \mathrm { a } 2 / \mathrm { b } 2 \mathrm { a } 2$ and $\mathrm { e l } 4 \mathrm { a } 2 / \mathrm { b } 3 \mathrm { a } 2$ , the higher of the two is claimed as the assay LoD. Thus, the overall Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra LoD for both ${ \tt s l } 3 { \tt a } 2 / { \tt b } 2 { \tt a } 2$ and e14a2/b3a2 is $0 . 0 0 3 0 \%$ $( I S ) / \mathrm { M R } 4 . 5 2$ .

The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was estimated with the data obtained from the LoD studies. The mean and standard deviation for the $\%$ $( I S )$ values and MR values were calculated for replicates at levels equal to the LoD, $0 . 0 0 3 0 \%$ $( I S ) / \mathrm { M R } 4 . 5 2$ , or greater with positivity greater or equal to $9 5 \%$ . The LoQ of the test is constrained by the LoD of the test; therefore, the LoQ was determined to be equal to the LoD, $0 . 0 0 3 0 \%$ (IS)/MR4.52. The results were also evaluated against the acceptance criteria for standard deviation $\mathrm { ( S D ) } \leq 0 . 3 6$ . The MR standard deviation for both e13a2/b2a2 (observed SD range MR0.27-MR0.34) and e14a2/b3a2 (observed SD range MR0.29-MR0.31) were within the acceptance criteria.

The limit of blank (LoB) was determined with 50 presumptive non-CML, normal healthy donor blood specimens, drawn into EDTA tubes. No measurable BCR-ABL values were observed for any of the tests. Thus, the overall LoB was determined to be $0 . 0 0 \%$ $( I S )$ .

# Analytical Specificity

The analytical and clinical specificity of Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra was evaluated for exclusivity by analyzing EDTA whole blood specimens drawn from fifty (50) healthy donors (non-CML) and twenty (20) leukemic specimens (AML/ALL). Breakpoint specificity was determined by testing normal healthy donor EDTA blood spiked with five (5) different leukemia cell lines representing 3 different types of leukemia (CML, ALL and APL) and 5 disease-breakpoints: K562 (CML/e14a2/b3a2) and BV173 (CML/e13a2/b2a2) served as positive controls; SUP-B15 (ALL/e1a2), AR230 (CML/e19a2) and NB4 (APL/PML-RARA) were evaluated for specificity.

No BCR-ABL signal was detected by Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra in any of the healthy nonCML specimens or AML/ALL leukemic specimens evaluated in this study.

Among the leukemia cell lines tested, CML cell lines (K562 and BV173) with p210 major breakpoints yielded the expected positive results. The CML cell line (AR230) with the $\mathsf { p } 2 3 0 \mathsf { e l } 9 \mathsf { a } 2$ breakpoint reported POSITIVE [Below LoD; $> \mathrm { M R } 4 . 5 2 / { < 0 . 0 0 3 0 \% ( I S ) } ]$ for 1 of 4 replicates tested at the targeted $10 \%$ (IS)/MR1.00 level based on the number of K562 cell. The positive result for the AR230 cell line was for a target level 3.52 logs above assay LoD and was not observed at the lower levels of $1 \%$ $( I S ) / \mathrm { M R } 2 . 0 0$ and $0 . 1 \%$ (IS)/MR3.00.

Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra is specific to the p210 BCR-ABL fusion transcript associated with CML and has an analytical specificity of $100 \%$ for non-CML EDTA blood specimens.

# Potentially Interfering Substances Study

This study evaluated five substances that may be present in EDTA whole blood specimens with the potential to interfere with the performance of the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test. The compounds and levels tested (Table 5) were based on guidance from the CLSI document EP07-A2. Interferents were tested in the background of CML clinical EDTA whole blood specimens representing three levels with five specimens per level: ${ > } 1 \%$ $( I S ) / { < } \mathbf { M } \mathbf { R } 2$ , $0 . 1 \%$ (IS)/MR3-MR2, and $< 0 . 1 \%$ $( I S ) / { > } \mathrm { M R } 3$ ). Test controls consisted of CML clinical specimens in EDTA whole blood at the respective BCR-ABL transcript level without the interfering substance. Each CML specimen was tested in the absence and presence of the five individual interferents at 4 replicates per condition.

A substance was considered non-interfering if in its presence the $\%$ mean $( I S ) / \mathrm { M R }$ ratio observed was within 3-fold difference when compared to the control.

No clinically significant inhibitory effects on the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test were observed with any of the interfering substances evaluated in this study. Although some variability and statistically significant differences (p-value $< 0 . 0 5$ ) in some tested

conditions were observed, the reported $\%$ $\bf \Pi _ { 0 } ^ { \prime } \left( \it I S \right) / \it M R$ ratios for test and control conditions were within the acceptable 3-fold range.

# Carry-Over Contamination

A study was conducted to demonstrate that single-use, self-contained GeneXpert cartridges prevent carry-over contamination from cartridges run sequentially in the same module. To demonstrate this, negative samples were run following very high positive samples in the same GeneXpert module. This study consisted of processing a NEGATIVE EDTA normal sample (CML-negative blood) in the same GeneXpert module immediately following a high POSITIVE sample (simulated CML positive blood) with $4 . 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ cells/mL of K562 cells spiked into CML-negative blood to yield ${ \sim } 1 0 \%$ (IS)/MR1.00. This testing sequence was repeated five times on each of the four GeneXpert modules. All twenty BCR-ABL positive samples were correctly reported as POSITIVE [#.## $: \%$ $( I S )$ and MR#.##], while all twenty BCR-ABL negative samples were correctly reported as NEGATIVE [Sufficient ABL transcript].

Traceability to the $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ World Health Organization (WHO) International Genetic Reference Panel for quantitation of BCR-ABL translocation by RQ-PCR (NIBSC code: 09/138) was demonstrated by measuring the WHO Reference Panel with 3 lots of the Xpert BCRABL Ultra test and comparing the measured values to the values published in the Reference Panel’s Instructions for Use. Each of the 4 Reference Panel members was tested with a minimum of 10 replicates per assay kit lot. The measured MR values for each level of the WHO Primary panel were calculated by regression to each lot of the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test (i.e., the WHO panel members were treated as clinical samples and fit to the linear regression model of the assay’s standard curve).

Furthermore, the measured MR values were compared to the published MR values through an additional regression analysis to determine slope and intercept values (Figure 3). The slope of the line was close to unity (0.96 to 1.1) and the intercept was calculated to be close to 0 (-0.03 to -0.06).

# Clinical Studies

# Clinical Performance

The clinical performance of the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test was evaluated at four institutions in the U.S as part of a multi-site clinical study. Three additional institutions served as specimen collection only sites. The study was conducted using fresh, prospectively collected EDTA whole blood specimens from patients with CML at any stage of disease, following initial diagnosis, with or without prior exposure to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor therapy or other CML treatment. In addition, the study included left over specimens stored as frozen lysates which were prepared from EDTA whole blood from the same patient population. The Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test performance was compared to a FDA-cleared molecular assay which detects and quantifies the mRNA transcripts for the p210 translocation types (e13a2/b2a2 or e14a2/b3a2) and uses the ABL as the endogenous control mRNA transcript.

A total of 266 eligible specimens were initially enrolled in the study, from which 57 were excluded due to use of an obsoleted procedure for extraction method (27), subject did not complete blood draw (8), shipping or testing delay (6), insufficient volume for testing (6), comparator test failed (6) or testing with incorrect Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra assay definition file (4) leaving 209 specimens which were tested.

Of 209 specimens, $9 7 . 1 \%$ (203/209) of the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra results were successful on the first attempt giving an initial non-determinate rate of $2 . 9 \%$ (6/209) and $9 9 . 5 \%$

(208/209) were successful upon retesting giving a final non-determinate rate of $0 . 5 \%$ (1/209).

Of the 208 specimens available for analysis, 150 $( 7 2 . 1 \% )$ were frozen specimens and 58 $( 2 7 . 9 \% )$ were fresh, prospectively collected specimens, for which demographic information was available. Among the fresh specimens, 24 $( 4 1 . 4 \% )$ were collected from female subjects and 34 $( 5 8 . 6 \% )$ from male subjects. The mean subject age for those providing fresh specimens was 60.5 years (range 28-85 years).

Of the 208 results that were available for analysis, 147 had results that were within the quantitative reportable range for both assays $[ 0 . 0 0 3 0 \% - 5 5 \%$ $( I S ) / \mathrm { M R } 4 . 5 2 - \mathrm { M R } 0 . 2 6$ for Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra and $0 . 0 0 2 \% - 5 0 \%$ $( I S ) / \mathrm { M R } 4 . 7 2 - \mathrm { M R } 0 . 3 0$ for the Comparator Assay]: 117 of which were from frozen left-over lysates and 30 of which were fresh prospectively collected specimens. The performance of the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test versus the Comparator Assay was evaluated using a Deming regression to determine the slope and intercept. Figure 4 shows the Deming regression and linear regression analysis of the 147 assay results (MR values).

Figure 4: Deming and Linear Regression Analyses

The slope and intercept from the Deming regression were 1.0266 and 0.0600 respectively. From these results, the predicted bias at the MMR (MR3) was calculated to be MR0.1244 ( $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $0 . 0 9 6 9 - 0 . 1 5 1 9 )$ ).

A Bland-Altman difference analysis was also performed using the 147 quantitative results that were within the reportable range for both the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test and Comparator Assay. The Bland-Altman graph (Figure 5) shows the upper and lower 2SD of the mean difference that was observed. The trend line of the bias across the MR range is also shown.

Figure 5: Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra Test MR vs Comparator Assay BCR-ABL MR Bland-Altman Difference Analysis

The mean difference (bias) was calculated to be 0.1336 with a SD of 0.3354. The majority $( 9 6 . 6 \%$ , 142/147) of the results were within the 2SD range (between -0.5372 and 0.8044).

# Precision and Reproducibility Study

The precision and reproducibility of the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test was evaluated in a multisite study in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3, “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline” and CLSI EP15-A3, “User

Verification of Performance for Precision and Trueness, Approved Guideline”.

A panel of eleven samples was prepared which included the following: One sample negative for BCR-ABL, two samples near the limit of detection (LoD) and eight samples at molecular response (MR) levels 1-4, using the two targets detected by the Xpert BCRABL Ultra test: $\mathrm { e } 1 3 \mathrm { a } 2 / \mathrm { b } 2 \mathrm { a } 2$ and e14a2/b3a2. The sample panel was made by diluting a bulk lysate of high $\%$ BCR-ABL/ABL specimens from patients with CML into pooled whole blood collected from healthy donors to obtain the desired level.

Table 6 shows the eleven samples included in this study.

Each of the eleven panel members was tested in duplicate two times per day on four different days by each of three different operators at three different sites. Three lots of Xpert BCR ABL kits were used and each operator performed testing with one lot (3 sites x 3 lots $_ { \textrm { x 1 } }$ operator/lot $_ { \textrm { X 4 } }$ days x 2 runs/operator x 2 replicates/run $= 1 4 4$ replicates/panel member).

The quantitative results were analyzed by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and the major components of variance were identified.

The ANOVA analysis for each panel member are shown in Table 7.

a. The Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra test performed on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems integrates sample purification and nucleic acid amplification. The overall variability of the test observed in this study (expressed as Total SD) includes variability contributed by both the on-board sample preparation and RT-qPCR steps. b. One replicate meeting the outlier requirements at the $9 9 \%$ level per CLSI EP15-A3 was removed from the analysis. c. 4 samples out of the 144 test results yielded a NEGATIVE result d. 1 sample out of the 144 test results yielded a NEGATIVE result

The observed total standard deviation for samples at MR1, MR2 and MR3 was $\leq 0 . 1 5$ . The maximum observed total standard deviation for samples near the LoD and MR4 was 0.33.

# Conclusions

The results of the nonclinical analytical and clinical performance studies summarized above demonstrate that the Xpert BCR-ABL Ultra is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
