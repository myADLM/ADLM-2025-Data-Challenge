For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only.

The ARCHITECT Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ARCHITECT ROMA) is a qualitative serum test that combines the results of the ARCHITECT HE4, ARCHITECT CA 125 II and menopausal status into a numerical score.

ARCHITECT ROMA is intended to aid in assessing whether a premenopausal or postmenopausal woman who presents with an ovarian adnexal mass is at high or low likelihood of finding malignancy on surgery. ARCHITECT ROMA is indicated for women who meet the following criteria: over age 18; ovarian adnexal mass present for which surgery is planned, and not yet referred to an oncologist. ARCHITECT ROMA must be interpreted in conjunction with an independent clinical and radiological assessment. The test is not intended as a screening or stand-alone diagnostic assay.

PRECAUTION: ARCHITECT ROMA should not be used without an independent clinical/radiological evaluation and is not intended to be a screening test or to determine whether a patient should proceed to surgery. Incorrect use of ARCHITECT ROMA carries the risk of unnecessary testing, surgery, and/or delayed diagnosis.

2. Indication(s) for use: Same as Intended Use.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements: ARCHITECT i2000SR system

# I. Device Description:

The ARCHITECT ROMA is a qualitative serum test that combines the results of two analytes, HE4 (ARCHITEC HE4) and CA 125 (ARCHITECT CA 125II) and menopausal status into a numerical score between 0.0 and 10.0. The premenopausal or postmenopausal status must be based on ovarian function determined with information available from clinical evaluation and medical history.

The test system consists of the ARCHITECT HE4 assay, the ARCHITECT CA 125 II assay and the ARCHITECT i2000SR. The ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 \mathrm { S R }$ is capable of calculating the ARCHITECT ROMA score. The immunoassays are performed according to the directions detailed in each product insert.

Both ARCHITECT HE4 and ARCHITECT CA $1 2 5 \ \mathrm { H I }$ are previously cleared devices, K093957 and K042731, respectively. The ARCHITECT HE4 assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) for the quantitative determination of HE4 antigen in human serum. The assay is to be used as an aid in monitoring recurrence or progressive disease in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Serial testing for patient HE4 assay values should be used in conjunction with other clinical methods used for monitoring ovarian cancer. ARCHITECT CA $1 2 5 \ \mathrm { H I }$ assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) for the quantitative determination of CA 125 reactive determinants in human serum and plasma on the ARCHITECT $i$ System and was previously cleared as an aid in monitoring response to therapy for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.

Using an algorithm and the value of the two analytes, ARCHITECT ROMA scores (numerical score from 0.0–10.0) for both premenopausal and postmenopausal will be calculated and indicate a low likelihood or high likelihood for finding malignancy on surgery.

# L. Test Principle:

The ARCHITECT HE4 assay is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative determination of HE4 antigen in human serum using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex. In the first step, sample and anti-HE4 coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined. HE4 antigen present in the sample binds to the anti-HE4 coated microparticles. After washing, acridinium-labeled anti-HE4 conjugate is added. Following another wash cycle, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). A direct relationship exists between the amount of HE4 antigen in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT i System optics.

The ARCHITECT CA 125 II assay is a two-step sandwich technique immunoassay to determine the presence of OC 125 defined antigen in human serum and plasma using CMIA technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex. In the first step of the assay, sample and antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-OC 125) coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined. CA 125 reactive determinants present in the sample bind to the antibody coated microparticles. After washing, a second acridinium-labeled antibody conjugate is added in the second step. Pre-Trigger and Trigger Solutions are then added to the reaction mixture; the resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). A direct relationship exists between the amount of CA 125 reactive determinants in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT™ i optical system.

The ARCHITECT $i 2 0 0 0 \mathrm { S R }$ is capable of calculating the ARCHITECT ROMA score. Using the value of the two analytes, ARCHITECT ROMA scores (numerical score from 0.0–10.0) for both premenopausal and postmenopausal will be calculated and will indicate whether a woman is at low likelihood or high likelihood for finding malignancy on surgery. Both premenopausal and postmenopausal ARCHITECT ROMA results will be reported to the ordering physician who will decide which result to use based on patient's menopausal status.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance:

Both ARCHITECT HE4 and ARCHITECT CA $1 2 5 \ \mathrm { H I }$ are previously cleared devices. Analytical performance for ARCHITECT HE4 and ARCHITECT CA

125 II were validated in K093957 and K042731, respectively. There have been no modifications of assay methods for ARCHITECT HE4 and ARCHITECT CA 125 II since the original clearance for each assay. Thus, a limited study was done to evaluate the analytical performance of the ARCHITECT ROMA score.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Lot-to-Lot Precision Study: A panel of five serum samples was tested using a combination of three lots each of ARCHITECT HE4 and ARCHITECT CA 125 II reagents and calibrator kits for a total of four different reagent/calibrator combinations. Each kit was used according to the package insert. The panel consisted of human serum samples spiked with OC125 defined antigen and HE4 recombinant antigen. Samples were tested in two replicates per run, two runs per day for 10 days $\mathtt { \Delta } _ { \mathtt { n } } = 4 0$ replicates per sample per lot).

Premenopausal and postmenopausal ARCHITECT ROMA scores were calculated using the ARCHITECT ROMA algorithm on-board the ARCHITECT analyzer utilizing the ARCHITECT System Software Version 9.00 or higher. The first ARCHITECT HE4 replicate and the first ARCHITECT CA 125 II replicate were used to compute the ARCHITECT ROMA score using both the premenopausal and postmenopausal algorithms. The second ARCHITECT HE4 replicate and the second ARCHITECT CA 125 II replicate were used to compute the ARCHITECT ROMA score using both the premenopausal and postmenopausal algorithms. This same process was used for calculating the four scores for the second run and subsequent panel runs on each day of testing. The following table displays the results for the lot-to-lot precision parameters. All data met the manufacturer’s predetermined acceptance criteria.

Simulation precision: In order to demonstrate precision of all possible combinations of analytes, a simulation precision study for ARCHITECT ROMA score was conducted based on the precision profiles of HE4 and CA 125 with different combinations of values of these two analytes. The statistical analysis of simulation of ARCHITECT ROMA score precision showed acceptable precision covering the range of ARCHITECT ROMA score from 0.0–10.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity studies for the HE4 and CA 125 assay kits were presented in K093957 and K042731, respectively. No new linearity data were presented in

this submission.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability and stability studies for the HE4 and CA 125 assay kits were presented in K093957 and K042731, respectively. No new traceability and stability data were presented in this submission.

Each assay uses its own calibrator and controls.

ARCHITECT HE4 Calibrator and Controls: Ig-HE4 is a fusion protein consisting of a human Fc antibody fragment and Human Epididymis protein HE4. The Ig-HE4 antigen is used as a calibrator protein in the HE4 assay to determine HE4 concentrations in human serum samples. The protein is produced in a stably transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line. The cell line was adapted to serum free growth medium at Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc. Recombinant antigen is used to prepare calibrators and controls for ARCHITECT HE4.

ARCHITECT CA 125 II Calibrator and Controls: The OC125 defined antigen is used in the ARCHITECT CA 125 II Calibrators and Controls. The concentrations are specific to each calibrator and control level. This material is obtained from Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc. proprietary human ovarian carcinoma cell line, McDonalds. OC 125 defined antigen is produced by the McDonalds cell line. The stock solution for calibrators is prepared by adding OC 125 defined antigen to a diluent to achieve the desired concentrations. The stock solution is tested to determine its actual concentration. Each Calibrator and Control is then prepared based on the actual concentration of the stock solution.

Stability:

Specimen: ARCHITECT ROMA is intended for use with serum. The specimen stability and storage claims are limited to the ARCHITECT HE4 assay. Serum can be stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 4 days before being tested.

# d. Detection limit:

The limits of detection and limits of quantitation reported in each assay’s package insert are incorporated into the algorithm such that results outside of the measuring interval are not imported and do not yield an ARCHITECT ROMA score.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference: Studies were conducted to evaluate the interference of ARCHITECT ROMA score by hemoglobin, bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated), lipid (triglyceride), rheumatoid factor (RF), and human antimouse antibodies (HAMA). CLSI guideline, EP7-A2 was used to design the interference experiments. Three pooled serum samples with ARCHITECT ROMA score at low, medium, and high were used in the studies. These samples were then supplemented with each interfering substance. The control samples were prepared without corresponding interfering substance. The control samples and test samples were tested in replicates of five using ARCHITECT ROMA. The ARCHITECT ROMA score was calculated for each sample and its control sample using a mean of five replicates of ARCHITECT HE4 and the mean of five replicates of ARCHITECT CA 125 II. The effect of each interfering substance on the ARCHITECT ROMA score was assessed by comparing the measurement of each test sample to the control. The summary of the results are shown in the following table, and all data met the manufacturer’s predetermined acceptance criteria.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A total of 188 samples were used for the method comparison study covering the premenopausal ROMA range 0.1–10.0 and the postmenopausal ROMA range 0.3–9.8. The enrolled patients consist of 138 diseased patients (78 premenopausal women and 60 postmenopausal woman) and 50 apparently healthy women (25 premenopausal women and 25 postmenopausal women). The ARCHITECT CA $1 2 5 \ \mathrm { H I }$ assay is used in both the test device and the predicate, and was performed so that ROMA scores could be calculated, but the same ARCHITECT CA 125 II assay result was used to calculate the ROMA scores for both the HE4 EIA and the ARCHITECT HE4 platforms. This study, therefore, focused on the comparison of the two HE4 platforms. Data analysis was performed using Deming and Passing-Bablok regression analysis and all data met the manufacturer’s predetermined acceptance criteria. The results are summarized in the following table:

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity/Clinical Specificity:

A clinical study was performed to evaluate the performance of ARCHITECT ROMA in pre- and postmenopausal women presenting to a generalist with an adnexal mass, for whom a decision to undergo surgery has been made. The study enrolled 512 patients at the 13 study sites. The patients were female patients over 18, presenting to a generalist at a general or specialty hospital with an ovarian cyst or an adnexal mass (defined as a simple, complex or a solid ovarian/pelvic mass) who were scheduled to undergo surgery. Blood samples were collected from all patients and tested with ARCHITECT HE4 and ARCHITECT CA 125 II at Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc.

The Initial Cancer Risk Assessment (ICRA) and all clinical information relating to the surgical procedures, including imaging reports and final pathology reports, were collected. All patients underwent surgery and tissues were examined by local pathologists. An independent pathologist reviewed all imaging reports, case report forms and histopathology reports from each patient’s institution pathologist, checking for discrepancies in the data. The performance of standalone use of ICRA, standalone use of ARCHITECT ROMA and adjunctive use of ICRA and ARCHITECT ROMA were evaluated by comparing to histopathology results for detecting the presence of ovarian malignancy.

Of the 512 patients, 53 patients were excluded from analysis. The most common reason for exclusion was no surgery was performed to remove an adnexal mass. In the final total of 459 $( 8 9 . 6 \% )$ evaluable patients, 250 $( 5 4 . 5 \% )$ were premenopausal and 209 $( 4 5 . 5 \% )$ were postmenopausal. All of the major racial groups were represented with $8 5 \%$ of White, $7 \%$ of Black, $3 \%$ Hispanic, $3 \%$ Asian, and $2 \%$ of other ethnicity.

1 Low malignant potential 2 Epethelilian ovarian cancer

The ARCHITECT ROMA test used the following cut points to evaluate the performance of the test in pre- and postmenopausal women presenting to a generalist with an adnexal mass, for whom a decision to undergo surgery has been made:

# Premenopausal:

ARCHITECT ROMA score $\geq 1 . 3 1$ : High likelihood of finding malignancy ARCHITECT ROMA score $< 1 . 3 1$ : Low likelihood of finding malignancy

# Postmenopausal:

ARCHITECT ROMA score $\geq 2 . 7 7$ : High likelihood of finding malignancy ARCHITECT ROMA score $< 2 . 7 7$ : Low likelihood of finding malignancy

The information provided by the ARCHITECT ROMA test should be used only as an adjunctive test to complement, not replace, other diagnostic and clinical procedures. The ability of ARCHITECT ROMA to contribute to the ICRA was evaluated by comparing the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) for standalone use of ARCHITECT ROMA, and adjunctive use of ICRA and ARCHITECT ROMA for the diagnosis of epithelian ovarian cancer (EOC) including tumors with low malignant potential (LMP) and all cancers including LMP. The results were cross-tabulated in a $2 \mathbf { x } 2 \mathbf { x } 2$ table of the malignancy as determined by histopathology, test result (positive or negative) by ICRA, and test result (positive/high likelihood or negative/low likelihood) by ARCHITECT ROMA. The results are presented in the tables below.

With adjunctive use of ICRA and ARCHITECT ROMA, sensitivity for malignancy increased from $7 7 . 3 \%$ to $9 0 . 9 \%$ . Specificity for malignancy decreased from $8 4 . 2 \%$ to $7 5 . 7 \%$ . PPV for the adjunctive use of ICRA and ARCHITECT ROMA decreased from $4 6 . 4 \%$ to $3 9 . 7 \%$ due to an increase in the number of false positive test added by addition of ARCHITECT ROMA to ICRA. However, NPV of adjunctive use of ICRA and ARCHITECT ROMA increased from $9 5 . 5 \%$ to $9 7 . 9 \%$ . This observed increase of $2 . 5 \%$ in NPV was statistically significant.

4. Clinical cut-off:

The following cut-offs are used to interpret the result. The ARCHITECT ROMA score is between 0.0 and 10.0.

Premenopausal: ARCHITECT ROMA score $\geq 1 . 3 1$ : High likelihood of finding malignancy ARCHITECT ROMA score $< 1 . 3 1$ : Low likelihood of finding malignancy

Postmenopausal: ARCHITECT ROMA score $\geq 2 . 7 7$ : High likelihood of finding malignancy ARCHITECT ROMA score $< 2 . 7 7$ : Low likelihood of finding malignancy

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Expected values in healthy women: In order to determine the normal reference ranges of the ARCHITECT ROMA score in healthy women, 122 premenopausal samples and 120 postmenopausal samples were tested. Samples covered ages ranging from 18 to 87 and represented whites $( 9 5 . 0 \% )$ , African American $( 3 . 3 \% )$ and Hispanic $( 0 . 1 \% )$ and Asian $( 0 . 1 \% )$ subjects. The results for the ARCHITECT ROMA score obtained from the pre- and postmenopausal populations are presented in the tables below:

1 Standard deviation

Overall, $9 5 \%$ of the premenopausal healthy women had an ARCHITECT ROMA score equal to or below 1.65. $9 5 \%$ of the postmenopausal healthy women had a ARCHITECT ROMA score equal to or below 2.02. It is recommended that each laboratory establish its own reference value for the population of interest.

Expected values in Non-Ovarian Malignancy Condition:

To evaluate the performance of ARCHITECT ROMA in subjects with other benign and other malignant conditions, the ARCHITECT ROMA was evaluated in women with benign conditions (benign gynecological disease, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, pregnant, and other benign disease) and in women with other malignant conditions (bladder cancer, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, and lung cancer). 733 samples were analyzed. The tables below summarize the results analyzed for premenopausal and postmenopausal samples.
