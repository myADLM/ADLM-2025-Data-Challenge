1. Intended use(s):

Lumipulse® $\pmb { G }$ Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA®) is a qualitative serum and plasma (lithium heparin or dipotassium EDTA) test that combines the results of Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ HE4, Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ CA125II and menopausal status into a numerical score.

Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA is intended to aid in assessing whether a premenopausal or postmenopausal woman who presents with an ovarian adnexal mass is at high or low likelihood of finding malignancy on surgery. Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA is indicated for women who meet the following criteria: over age 18; ovarian adnexal mass present for which surgery is planned, and not yet referred to an oncologist. Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA must be interpreted in conjunction with an independent clinical and radiological assessment. The test is not intended as a screening or stand-alone diagnostic assay.

PRECAUTION: Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA should not be used without an independent clinical /radiological evaluation and is not intended to be a screening test or to determine whether a patient should proceed to surgery. Incorrect use of Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA carries the risk of unnecessary testing, surgery, and/or delayed diagnosis.

2. Indication(s) for use: Same as Intended Use

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements: LUMIPULSE G1200 system

# I. Device Description:

Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA is a qualitative serum and plasma test that combines the results of two analytes, HE4 (Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ HE4) and CA125 (Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ CA 125 II) and menopausal status into a numerical score between 0.00 and 10.00. The premenopausal or postmenopausal status must be based on ovarian function determined with information available from clinical evaluation and medical history. The test system consists of Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ HE4, Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ CA 125 II, the Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA Calculator Tool and the LUMIPULSE G1200 System. The LUMIPULSE G1200 System is not capable of calculating the ROMA score. The immunoassays are performed according to the directions detailed in each product insert.

Both Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ HE4 and Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ CA 125 II are previously $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ cleared Class II devices (K151378 and K142895 respectively). The Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ HE4 assay is a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) for the quantitative determination of HE4 antigen in human serum and plasma (lithium heparin or dipotassium EDTA) on the LUMIPULSE $\pmb { G }$ System. The assay is to be used as an aid in monitoring recurrence or progressive disease in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Serial testing for patient HE4 assay values should be used in conjunction with other clinical methods used for monitoring ovarian cancer. Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ CA $1 2 5 \ \mathrm { H I }$ assay is a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) for the quantitative determination of CA125 in human serum and plasma (sodium heparin, lithium heparin, or dipotassium EDTA) on the LUMIPULSE $\pmb { G }$ System. The assay is to be used as an aid in monitoring recurrence or progressive disease in patients with ovarian cancer. Serial testing for patient CA125 assay values should be used in conjunction with other clinical methods used for monitoring ovarian cancer.

Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA scores (numerical score from 0.00–10.00) for both premenopausal and postmenopausal women are calculated using the Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA Calculator Tool to indicate a low likelihood or high likelihood for finding malignancy on surgery using the value of the two immunoassays (Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ HE4 and Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ CA125II).

# L. Test Principle:

Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ HE4 is an assay system, including a set of immunoassay reagents, for the quantitative measurement of HE4 in specimens based on CLEA technology by a two-step sandwich immunoassay method on the LUMIPULSE G1200 System. HE4 in specimens specifically binds to anti-HE4 monoclonal antibody (mouse) on the particles, and antigen-antibody immunocomplexes are formed. The particles are washed and rinsed to remove unbound materials. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP: calf)- labeled anti-HE4 monoclonal antibody (mouse) specifically binds to HE4 of the immunocomplexes on the particles, and additional immunocomplexes are formed. The particles are washed and rinsed to remove unbound materials. Substrate Solution is added and mixed with the particles. AMPPD contained in the Substrate Solution is dephosphorylated by the catalysis of ALP indirectly conjugated to particles. Luminescence (at a maximum wavelength of $4 7 7 \mathrm { n m } )$ is generated by the cleavage reaction of dephosphorylated AMPPD. The luminescent signal reflects the amount of HE4.

Lumipulse $G \mathrm { C A l } 2 5 \mathrm { I I }$ is an assay system, including a set of immunoassay reagents, for the quantitative measurement of CA125 in specimens based on CLEA technology by a two-step sandwich immunoassay method on the LUMIPULSE $\pmb { G }$ System. CA125 in specimens specifically binds to anti-CA125 monoclonal antibody (mouse) on the particles, and antigen-antibody immunocomplexes are formed. The particles are washed and rinsed to remove unbound materials. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP: calf)-labeled anti-CA125 monoclonal antibody (mouse) specifically binds to CA125 of the immunocomplexes on the particles, and additional immunocomplexes are formed. The particles are washed and rinsed to remove unbound materials. Substrate Solution is added and mixed with the particles. AMPPD contained in the Substrate Solution is dephosphorylated by the catalysis of ALP indirectly conjugated to particles. Luminescence (at a maximum wavelength of $4 7 7 \mathrm { n m }$ ) is generated by the cleavage reaction of dephosphorylated AMPPD. The luminescent signal reflects the amount of CA125.

The Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA Calculator Tool will be used for calculating the ROMA score. Using the value of the two analytes, Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA scores (numerical score from 0.00–10.00) for both premenopausal and postmenopausal will be calculated and will indicate whether a woman is at low likelihood or high likelihood for finding malignancy on surgery. Both premenopausal and postmenopausal Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA results will be reported to the ordering physician who will decide which result to use based on patient's menopausal status.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance:

Both Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ HE4 and Lumipulse $G \operatorname { C A } 1 2 5 \operatorname { I I }$ are previously cleared devices. Analytical performance for Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ HE4 and Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ CA 125 II were validated in K151378 and K142895, respectively. There has been no modification of assay methods for Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ HE4 and Lumipulse $G \operatorname { C A } 1 2 5 \operatorname { I I }$ since the original clearance for each assay. Thus, a limited study was done to evaluate the analytical performance of the Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA.

All studies were performed on the Lumipulse G1200 instrument.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Total Imprecision:

A panel of five serum samples were tested using one lot each of Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ HE4 and Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ CA 125 II reagents and calibrator kits according to each assay’s package insert. The panel consisted of four pooled human serum samples and one sample that contained $5 5 \%$ native HE4 and $45 \%$ spiked HE antigen (panel 5).

Total imprecision was calculated at one site by testing each sample in two runs with two replicates per run for 20 non-consecutive days $( \mathtt { n } = 8 0$ replicates per sample). The overall study was performed based on CLSI guideline EP05-A3.

The following table displays the results for the repeatability and with-in laboratory reproducibility. All data met the manufacturer’s predetermined acceptance criteria.

# Simulation precision:

In order to demonstrate the effect on precision of all possible combinations of precision of the two analytes, a simulation precision study for Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA score was conducted based on the precision profiles of HE4 and CA 125 with different combinations of values of these two analytes. The statistical analysis of simulation of Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA score precision showed acceptable precision covering the range of Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA score from 0–10.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity studies for HE4 and CA 125 assay kits were presented in K151378 and K142895, respectively. No new linearity data were presented in this submission.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability and stability studies for the HE4 and CA 125 assay kits were presented in K151378 and K142895, respectively. No new traceability and stability data were presented in this submission.

Calibrators and Controls:

Each assay uses its own calibrator and controls.

Lumipulse G CA125II Calibrators

The Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ CA125II Calibrators are for the use in the calibration of the LUMIPULSE $\pmb { G }$ System for the quantitative measurement of CA125 in serum or plasma (sodium heparin, lithium heparin, and dipotassium EDTA). The OC125 defined antigen is used in the LUMIPULSE $\pmb { G }$ CA125II Calibrators. This material is obtained from Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc. proprietary human ovarian carcinoma cell line.

# Lumipulse G HE4 Calibrators

The Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ HE4 Calibrators are for the use in the calibration of the LUMIPULSE $\pmb { G }$ System for the quantitative measurement of HE4 in serum or plasma (lithium heparin and dipotassium EDTA). The HE4 antigen is used in the Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ HE4 Calibrators. This material is provided by Fujirebio Diagnostics, AB. The Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ HE4 assay is standardized against the Fujirebio Diagnostics HE4 EIA.

# Stability:

Sample Stability: Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA is intended for use with serum and plasma (lithium heparin and dipotassium EDTA). The specimen stability and storage claims are limited to the Lumipulse $G \mathrm { H E 4 }$ assay. Samples can be stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 3 days or at $- 1 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ or colder for up to 1 month before being tested.

Calibration Curve: For Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ HE4 and Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ CA125II, the calibration curve is stable up to 30 days.

Reagent Stability: Users are instructed to refer to the individual stability information in the package insert of each assay.

Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ HE4 is stable when stored at $2 { - } 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until the expiration date stated on the label outside of the kit box. The current shelf life of Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ HE4 is 8 months.

Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ CA125II is table when stored at $2 { - } 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until the expiration date stated on the label outside of the kit box. The current shelf life of Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ CA125II is 10 months.

# d. Detection limit:

The limits of detection and limits of quantitation reported in each assay’s package insert are incorporated into the algorithm such that results outside of the measuring interval are not imported into the algorithm and do not yield a Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA score.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference: Studies were conducted to evaluate the interference of Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA score by endogenous substances. CLSI guideline, EP07-A2 “Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry, Approved Guideline – Second Edition”, was used to design the interference experiments.

Five patient samples with Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA scores across the measuring range (0.55–9.86) were tested in this study. These samples were then supplemented with each interfering substance. The control samples were prepared without corresponding interfering substance. The control samples and test samples were tested in replicates of three using Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA. The Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA score was calculated for each sample and its control sample using a mean of three replicates of Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ HE4 and the mean of three replicates of Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ CA 125II. The effect of each interfering substance on the Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA score was assessed by comparing the measurement of each test sample to the control. The summary of the results are shown in the following table, and all data met the manufacturer’s predetermined acceptance criteria.

Simulated Matrix Comparison Study:

A simulation study was performed to evaluate the worst-case conditions where both the Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ HE4 and Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ CA 125II results showed the maximal matrix effects. The maximal matrix effects were calculated using the data for the $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ -EDTA plasma and Li-Heparin plasma matrix comparisons that were completed for Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ HE4 and Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ CA $1 2 5 \mathrm { { I I } }$ in K151378 and K142895, respectively. The results of the simulation study were acceptable.

3. Clinical studies:

# a. Clinical Sensitivity/Clinical Specificity:

A clinical study was done to validate Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA in pre- and postmenopausal women presenting to a generalist with an adnexal mass, for whom a decision to undergo surgery has been made. The study enrolled 512 patients at the 13 study sites. The patients were female patients over 18, presenting to a generalist at a general or specialty hospital with an ovarian cyst or an adnexal mass (defined as a simple, complex or a solid ovarian/pelvic mass) who were scheduled to undergo surgery. Blood samples were collected from all patients and tested with Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ HE4 and Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ CA 125II at Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc.

The Initial Cancer Risk Assessment (ICRA) and all clinical information relating to the surgical procedures, including imaging reports and final pathology reports, were collected. All patients underwent surgery and tissues were examined by local pathologists. An independent pathologist reviewed all imaging reports, case report forms and histopathology reports from each patient’s institution pathologist, checking for discrepancies in the data. The performance of standalone use of ICRA, standalone use of Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA and adjunctive use of ICRA and Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA were evaluated by comparing to histopathology results for detecting the presence of ovarian malignancy.

Of the 512 patients, 53 patients were excluded from analysis. The most common reason for exclusion was no surgery was performed to remove an adnexal mass. 10 additional patients were excluded because there was not enough sample available for testing, and one patient was excluded because the Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ HE4 value was outside of the measuring range of the device. In the final total of 450 evaluable patients, 244 $( 5 4 \% )$ were premenopausal and 206 $( 4 6 \% )$ were postmenopausal. All of the major racial groups were represented with $84 \%$ White, $7 \%$ of Black, $3 \%$ Hispanic, $3 \%$ Asian, and $3 \%$ of other ethnicity. The age range of the patients was 18–89 with a median age of 49.

The statistics for the 450 enrolled subjects with pathology classification are summarized in the following table:

1 Low malignant potential 2 Epethelilian ovarian cancer

The Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA test used the following cut points to evaluate the performance of the test in pre- and postmenopausal women presenting to a generalist with an adnexal mass, for whom a decision to undergo surgery has been made. The cut-offs are the same for serum, $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } .$ -EDTA plasma, and LiHeparin plasma samples.

# Premenopausal:

Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA score $\geq 1 . 3 1$ : High likelihood of finding malignancy Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA score $< 1 . 3 1$ : Low likelihood of finding malignancy

# Postmenopausal:

Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA score $\geq 2 . 7 7$ : High likelihood of finding malignancy Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA score $< 2 . 7 7$ : Low likelihood of finding malignancy

The information provided by the Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA test should be used only as an adjunctive test to complement, not replace, other diagnostic and clinical procedures. The ability of Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA to contribute to the ICRA was evaluated by comparing the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) for standalone use of Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA, and adjunctive use of ICRA and Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA. The performance of Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA evaluated for diagnosis of EOC including LMP are presented below.

Overall, $9 5 \%$ of the premenopausal health female subjects had a Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA score equal to or below 1.73. Ninety five percent of the postmenopausal healthy female subjects had a Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA score equal to or below 2.03. These values were chosen based on the 95th percentile of the population tested. It is recommended that each laboratory established its own reference value for the population of interest.

# Expected values in Non-Ovarian Malignancy Conditions:

To evaluate the performance of Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA in subjects with other benign and other malignant conditions, Lumipulse $\pmb { G }$ ROMA was evaluated in women with benign conditions (benign gynecological disease, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, pregnant, and other benign disease) and in women with other malignant conditions (bladder cancer, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, and lung cancer). A total of 880 subjects were analyzed. The tables below summarize the results analyzed for premenopausal and postmenopausal samples.
