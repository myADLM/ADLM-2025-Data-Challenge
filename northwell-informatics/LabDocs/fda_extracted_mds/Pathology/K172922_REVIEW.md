2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:

Display Equivalency Study:

Technical performance testing for Barco MMPC-4127F1 (PP27QHD) display was performed. The new display was compared to the display that is part of the predicate device PIPS - PP27QHD (2.5). Testing included assessment of the following parameters:

luminance, color, noise, resolution, pixel defects, artifacts, temporal response, grayscale, and specular and diffuse coefficients. All testing results demonstrated that the Barco MMPC-4127F1 (PP27QHD) display is equivalent to the predicate device display.

Luminance: The Barco MMPC-4127F1 (PP27QHD) and the predicate device use the same LCD panel. The luminance remains within the specified range of $3 5 0 \mathrm { c d } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } \pm 1 0 $ $\%$ , and the luminance stability is within approximately $0 . 4 \%$ .

Color: The color scale response when sRGB calibrated and the sRGB gamut are similar between the PP27QHD and the predicate device. The color stability over time is within the specified maximum deviation of 0.0050 in both x and y.

Noise: The PP27QHD and the predicate device use the same LCD panel and therefore the noise and the noise power spectrum are identical. The RMS (image variance) for multiple video levels of both luminance and color as measured on gray fields were the same.

Resolution: The MTF of the display system was measured according to the method described by Hans Roehrig et al. (2004) [Hans Roehrig, Jerry Gaskill, Jiahua Fan, Ananth Poolla, Chadwick Martin, "In-field evaluation of the modulation transfer function of electronic display devices", Proc. SPIE 5367, Medical Imaging 2004: Visualization, Image-Guided Procedures, and Display, (5 May 2004)]. The MTF of the camera system was approximately $9 8 \%$ at the display’s Nyquist frequency. The spatial resolution of the panel is 109 dpi (dots per inch).

Artifacts: The PP27QHD and the predicate are flat panel displays. There is no problem of impedance matching in a purely digital system, ringing and ghosting are not present. This is identical for the PP27QHD and the predicate device.

Temporal response: The PP27QHD and the predicate device use the same LCD panel and therefore the temporal response is identical. The response time is approximately $1 2 \mathrm { m s }$ and the maximum response time is $2 4 ~ \mathrm { m s }$ .

Grayscale: There is no difference in greyscale behavior between the PP27QHD and the predicate device when calibrated to sRGB (default setting).

Specular and diffuse coefficients: The same LCD panel is used in both the predicate and the PP27QHD and therefore the specular and diffuse coefficients in functions of wavelength are identical.

# K. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as applicable, and the special controls for this device type.

# L. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
