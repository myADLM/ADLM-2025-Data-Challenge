# I. Device Description:

The Aperio AT2 DX System is an automated digital slide creation and viewing system.

he system is composed of the following components:

Aperio AT2 DX digital slide scanner Viewing Workstation executing ImageScope DX viewer software

The Aperio AT2 DX digital slide scanner digitizes microscope slides at diagnostic resolutions: $0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { m } /$ /pixel $2 0 \mathrm { x }$ objective equivalent) and $0 . 2 5 \mu \mathrm { m } /$ pixel (40x objective equivalent), to create digital WSI images. The Aperio AT2 DX scanner has a capacity of $4 0 0 ~ 1 \mathbf { x } 3$ inch glass slides. After the slides are loaded the scanning process begins when the operator starts the Aperio AT2 DX scanner and finishes when the scanner has completed scanning of all loaded slides. The image acquisition components include a white LED light source, Olympus Plan Apo $2 0 \mathbf { x }$ lens with a Numeric Aperture (NA) of 0.75, a 10/90 beam splitter, a 2D area-scan camera and a 1D line-scan camera which is the primary image capture device. The 10/90 bean splitter sends $10 \%$ of the photons toward the 2D area-scan camera and remaining $90 \%$ of the photons toward the 1D linescan camera. Two motorized stages are used with one stage for moving the slide to be scanned and the other stage for moving the objective lens for focusing purposes. During scanning with a $2 0 \mathrm { x }$ objective lens, the motion of the slide stage combined with the speed of the 1D line-scan camera, the field of view of the objective lens and the number of pixels of the camera result in a resolution of $0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { m } / \mathrm { p i x e l }$ for $2 0 \mathrm { x }$ magnification. $4 0 \mathrm { x }$ magnification is achieved with a magnification doubler, with $0 . 2 5 \mu \mathrm { m } /$ pixel resolution. Focus during the scan is maintained using a triangulated focus map built from individual focus points determined in a separate step before scanning is started. Proprietary software is used for image processing during acquisition. Leica’s proprietary format, SVS, is used to store and transmit the images between the Aperio AT2 DX digital slide scanner and the ImageScope DX viewer on viewing station. Software Aperio Controller DX runs on the AT2 DX workstation as a system service and controls the operations of the scanner. Software Aperio Console DX is a desktop program that runs on the AT2 DX workstation with a display monitor (Dell MR2416) and provides user interface for an operator to control operations of AT2 DX scanner.

The ImageScope DX application is a software only subsystem to be used with the display monitor (Dell MR2416) and runs on a separate viewing workstation PC. The ImageScope DX software opens the WSI images acquired with Aperio AT2 DX scanner from the image storage attached to local network and uses the color profile to render the image data to the calibrated display monitor to deliver the image view at the appropriate magnification and color. Functionalities of ImageScope DX include navigating the slide similar to using an optical microscope, panning across the slide to examine all tissue regions, zooming in and out to allow review at different magnification levels, and allowing pathologist annotations during review.

The different subsystems of the Aperio AT2 DX System are connected over an IT network at the user site. The IT hardware/software that supports the ImageScope DX Application Server & Storage software is not provided as part of the Aperio AT2 DX System, but may be located in a central server room separate from the workstation with the ImageScope DX viewing software and Display. The communication of data between Aperio AT2 DX scanner and ImageScope DX application is via a customer provided wired network or a direct connected cable between these subsystems. Aperio AT2 DX System includes a display that has been validated as part of the pivotal clinical study.

The Aperio AT2 DX System allows pathologists to view and evaluate digital images of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue slides that would otherwise be appropriate for manual visualization by conventional brightfield (light) microscopy. The Aperio AT2 DX System does not include any automated image analysis applications that would constitute computer aided detection or diagnosis.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Guidance for Industry “Technical Performance Assessment of Digital Pathology Whole Slide Imaging Devices", dated April 20, 2016.

Special controls under 21 CFR Sec. 864.3700 Whole slide imaging system.

# L. Test Principle:

The Aperio AT2 DX System is an automated system designed for scanning and digitizing surgical pathology slides prepared from FFPE tissue. These digitized images can then be reviewed and interpreted by pathologists for clinical (patient care) purposes.

Prior to scanning the slide on the Aperio AT2 DX scanner, the technician conducts quality control of the slides per the laboratory’s standards (e.g., staining, cover-slipping, barcode placement, etc.). The technician then places the slides into slide feeder (Autoloader) which is a component of the Aperio AT2 DX scanner as a batch. With AutoLoader, the scanner automatically mounts each slide on the scanning stage, generates a macro image that includes the slide label and a low magnification image of the entire slide. The system then locates specimen tissues within the slide scan area, which are subsequently scanned at high resolution $( 0 . 5 0 \mu \mathrm { m } /$ pixel for $2 0 \mathrm { x }$ and $0 . 2 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { m } /$ pixel for 40x). After the slide is scanned, it is returned to the same slot of the same rack from which it was originally obtained.

The images scanned in the Aperio AT2 DX scanner are compressed and saved using proprietary SVS file format. The SVS image files are then transmitted to customer provided Medical Device Data System (MDDS). The SVS image files acquired on Aperio AT2 DX scanner can be reviewed through the supplied ImageScope DX review application only. ImageScope DX application allows users to open a case, review the WSI images of the slides (eSlides) by navigating around and viewing the WSI image at the desired magnifications. The pathologist is responsible for ensuring the validity of the interpretation of the digital images obtained from the Aperio AT2 DX System.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The objective of this study was to evaluate intra-system, inter-system/site, withinpathologist and between-pathologist precision for the Aperio AT2 DX System.

The precision of the device was based on five reading pathologists’ assessments and identification of specific histopathologic “features” that are observed in FFPE Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained slides. Twenty-three (23) primary features were selected for the analytical studies. The selected primary features were evaluated at their relevant magnifications with twelve (12) primary features evaluated at $2 0 \mathrm { x }$ magnification level and eleven (11) primary features evaluated at $4 0 \mathrm { x }$ magnification level.

The Precision Panel Slide Curator (curator) identified study slides by conducting a Lab Information System (LIS) search and reviewing the microscope slides from consecutive cases that potentially contain the study features (Table 1). A representative H&E stained slide or a re-cut slide containing the feature(s) of interest was obtained from each case. After the curator selected and marked the study features on the slides, the slides were scanned at magnification levels designated to the study features, either $2 0 \mathbf { x }$ or $4 0 \mathrm { x }$ magnification. The curator reviewed the glass slides through the microscope while reviewing the WSI images on the monitor to extract Field of Views (FOVs) containing the study features from the WSI images using a lossless compression type. For each subsequent WSI images of the same slide, the annotations were manually replicated by a technician using the image viewing software to extract and randomly rotate the FOVs by 90, 180 or 270 degrees to minimize recall bias. A trained study personnel verified the FOV filenames and also that the FOV extraction areas were correct and enrolled the FOVs in the study. During precision study, the extracted FOV images were restricted for both the area of tissue visible to the reading pathologists and for the viewing magnification. The reading pathologists were not allowed to navigate the WSI image or change magnification or get access to any clinical information associated with the study slides. Additional slides that may or may not include any of the study features were included as “wild card” slides to reduce recall bias. The “wild card” FOVs were extracted by following the same procedures as the study FOVs.

As shown in Table 1, each primary study feature was represented in three (3) FFPE sections of different organ types. From each slide, two (2) or three (3) FOVs containing either one primary study feature, or a primary study feature and secondary study feature(s) in each FOV were selected. A total of 202 FOVs were selected from 69 glass slides. Out of 202 FOVs, 46 FOVs (from 24 slides) contained multiple histologic features and 156 FOVs (from 62 slides) contained one primary histologic feature. In addition, 36 wild card FOVs were selected from 12 glass slides.

A total of five reading pathologists reviewed the FOVs in precision study. Three pathologists reviewed for within- and between-pathologist precision, one pathologist reviewed for intra-system precision and one pathologist reviewed for intersystem/inter-site precision. For each magnification (20x or 40x), a separate checklist containing eleven (11) features (for $4 0 \mathrm { x }$ ) or twelve (12) features (for $2 0 \mathrm { x }$ ) was developed. For each FOV, the reading pathologist recorded the presence or absence of each of 11 features (for 40x) or 12 features (for 20x) on a checklist. Only the recorded results from study FOVs were used for statistical analysis. The results of wild card FOVs were not included in the statistical analysis.

# Intra-System Precision

The panel of 69 study slides was split equally among the three (3) sites (i.e., each site scanned a separate subset of slides). Each site has a single scanning system. For each system, 23 slides were scanned once on each of three (3) days, producing three (3) sets of scans for each slide. FOVs were extracted from scanned WSI images. The FOVs from three scanning sessions were evaluated by one reading pathologist over three different reading sessions with at least a two-week washout period in between the reading sessions. In each reading session, the reading pathologist evaluated all 202 study FOVs from each of three scanning sessions (across three scanning systems), plus unique “wild card” FOVs to assist in preventing recall bias between reading sessions.

For each system, agreements between scan 1 versus scan 2, scan 1 versus scan 3 and scan 2 versus scan 3 were analyzed. The overall intra-system precision was based on the pooled data of all three systems. A bootstrap approach was used to calculate $9 5 \%$ Confidence Intervals (CIs) with the following exception. When the agreement estimate was $100 \%$ , the Arcsine (variance stabilizing transformation) approach that corrected for the continuity was used to calculate CIs.

# Inter-System/Inter-Site Precision

At each of three study sites, a study technician scanned the entire set of 69 study slides once. FOVs from three scanning sessions (resulting from one session from each of the three sites) were extracted. From all the scanning systems, 606 FOVs were transferred to a single reading pathologist for evaluation in three separate reading sessions. In each reading session, the reading pathologist evaluated all 202 study FOVs from a single site, plus unique “wild card” FOVs to assist in preventing recall bias between reading sessions.

Agreements between systems at Site 1 versus Site 2, systems at Site 1 versus Site 3 and systems at Site 2 versus Site 3 were analyzed. The overall inter-system/inter-site precision is based on the pooled data from each system to system comparison. A bootstrap approach was used to calculate $9 5 \%$ CIs.

The entire set of 69 slides were scanned once at one site. FOVs were extracted and saved in three different orientations. From all the orientations, 606 FOVs were presented to each of three reading pathologists for evaluation in three reading sessions. In each reading session, each reading pathologist evaluated all 202 study FOVs plus unique “wild card” FOVs to assist in preventing recall bias between reading sessions.

For within-pathologist precision, agreements between FOVs in orientation 1 versus orientation 2, orientation 1versus orientation 3, and orientation 2 versus orientation 3 were analyzed for each reading pathologist. The overall within-pathologist precision was based on the pooled data from each reading pathologist. A bootstrap approach was used to calculate $9 5 \%$ CIs.

representative users performing all tasks (including critical tasks) required for operation of the device, and subjective assessment of failure was provided. All participants were able to perform all tasks (including the critical tasks) and no critical task failures were observed. There were some occasional difficulties that are generally expected with any piece of new software and instrument but learnability and ease of use appeared to be considerably high. All difficulties observed were of little influence on the perception of the usability, and no difficulties or failures were observed on tasks that could lead to patient harm. In all instances both pathologists and histopathology technicians were able to easily identify cases and ensure that everything was complete.

# 4. Clinical studies:

A multi-center study was conducted to demonstrate that viewing, reviewing, and diagnosing digital images of surgical pathology FFPE tissue slides using the Aperio AT2 DX System is non-inferior to using optical (light) microscopy. The primary endpoint was the difference in major discordance rates between WSI review modality (WSIR) and microscope slide review modality (MSR) when compared to the reference (main) diagnosis, which is based on the original sign-out pathologic diagnosis rendered at the institutions, using an optical (light) microscope.

Five sites were used in the study. At each site, a case curation pathologist or lab technician searched the site’s LIS to identify candidate cases with a sign-out pathologist diagnosis. Candidate cases were identified consecutively, starting with cases at least one (1) year old (sign-out diagnosis was made at least one year before) and continuing with sequentially older cases. The case curation pathologist then checked whether the candidate case met the study eligibility criteria. The case curation pathologist reviewed the sign-out diagnosis and supporting documentation available at the time of the diagnosis (i.e., pathology report). By reviewing the microscopic slides used to make the sign-out diagnosis, the slide(s) that were representative of the sign-out diagnosis for the case were identified. The selected slides included H&E, immunohistochemistry (IHC), special stains and any slides that were not critical to diagnosis but supported the final surgical pathology report (e.g., margins, lymph node status, vascular and neural invasion), and any slides representing required elements of the College of American Pathologists (CAP) applicable cancer protocols. In the case of IHCs and special stains, the inclusion of control slides was required to fulfill the quality checks according to general clinical practice. The site’s curation verification pathologist verified that the selected slide(s) reflected the main diagnosis for the case as well as required ancillary information for cancer cases, met all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, and then the case was enrolled.

Across five sites, a total of 2045 cases (5849 slides) consisting of multiple organ and tissue types were enrolled. At each site (with exception of Site 1 that had three pathologists), four pathologists read all the cases assigned to the site using both MSR and WSIR modalities in an alternating fashion and randomized order and with a washout period of 31 days or longer between the MSR and WSIR reads, resulting in a total of 7781 planned WSIR reads and 7781 planned MSR reads. The reading pathologists were provided with all representative slide(s) of a case at once. An electronic case report form (eCRF) was completed to document the reading pathologist’s diagnosis. Three adjudicators reviewed the reader diagnoses against the corresponding sign-out diagnoses and determined whether the reader diagnoses were concordant, minor discordant or major discordant. A major discordance was defined as a difference in diagnosis that would be associated with a clinically important difference in patient management. A minor discordance was defined as a difference in diagnosis that would not be associated with a clinically important difference in patient management. For each case, two adjudication pathologists independently reviewed the eCRFs to determine whether or not the diagnosis was consistent with the sign-out diagnosis. In the event that there was a disagreement between the two adjudicators, a third adjudication pathologist reviewed the case to achieve majority vote. In cases where all three adjudicators had a different opinion, consensus was arrived at in an adjudication panel meeting consisting of the same three adjudication pathologists.

Inclusion criteria:

All glass slides with human tissue obtained via surgical pathology of the original case were available.   
• The original sign-out diagnosis and ancillary supporting information were available.   
• The selected slide(s) for the main diagnosis and the control slide(s) (e.g., controls for IHC stained slides) matched the study requested organ type and fulfilled the quality checks according to general clinical practice. For cases with multiple diagnoses in a single sign-out pathology report, only the main diagnosis and ancillary information were included.

# Exclusion criteria:

• The H&E stained slides that were used for the original sign-out diagnosis were not available at the site and re-cuts were not available.   
• If applicable, the IHC or special stain slides that were used for the original signout diagnosis were not available at the site or had unacceptable artifacts. Control slides for IHC or special stain were not available.   
• Cases for which slides needed to support the original sign-out diagnosis required either a special light source (e.g., a mercury lamp for fluorescence microscopy) or special filters (e.g., for polarized light).   
• Cases with slides containing unremovable markings or were damaged.   
• Cases that contained frozen sections or gross specimens only.   
• Cases that were missing significant clinical and ancillary information that was available at the time the case was originally interpreted (e.g., X-rays).   
• Cases that were signed out less than one year prior to the date of curation. Only one case could be enrolled per patient.

For the primary objective of demonstrating the WSIR major discordance rate to be noninferior to the MSR major discordance rate, a Generalized Linear Mixed Model

(GLIMMIX) logistic regression was conducted. For each reading result the dependent variable was the major discordance status and independent variables included modality as a fixed effect (WSIR vs. MSR) and site, reader, and case as random effects. A two-sided $9 5 \%$ CI for the modality effect, i.e., the overall major discordance rate difference (WSIR minus MSR), was constructed from this analysis. If the upper bound of the $9 5 \%$ CI was less than the non-inferiority margin of $4 \%$ , WSIR would be considered non-inferior to MSR.

A total of 2045 cases were included in the Full Analysis Set with 5849 slides and 7781 planned diagnoses for each modality. During the study, reading pathologists deferred cases by either modality per the site’s standard procedure, mimicking the intended use. 172 cases were deferred in both modalities, 87 cases ( $1 . 1 \%$ of total planned reads) were deferred only in MSR modality and 100 cases ( $1 . 3 \%$ of total planned reads) were deferred only in WSIR modality. 7509 WSIR diagnoses and $7 5 2 2 \mathrm { M S R }$ diagnoses that were adjudicated by the adjudication panel and had consensus scores, were included in the statistical analyses. Deferred diagnoses were excluded from the data analysis as missing data.

The observed overall major discordance rate, i.e., over all sites, reading pathologists and organs, was $3 . 7 3 \%$ for WSIR modality and $3 . 2 8 \%$ for MSR modality. The WSIR-MSR difference in major discordance rate was $0 . 4 5 \%$ . The major discordance rates as estimated by the GLIMMIX logistic model (“modeled”) resulted in similar, slightly lower, proportions, i.e., $3 . 6 4 \%$ for WSIR modality and $3 . 2 0 \%$ for MSR modality. The WSIR-MSR difference in major discordance rate was $0 . 4 4 \%$ , with derived two-sided $9 5 \%$ CI of $[ - 0 . 1 5 \%$ , $1 . 0 3 \% ]$ . The upper limit of this confidence interval was less than the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of $4 \%$ , and therefore, the WSIR modality using the Aperio AT2 DX System was demonstrated to be non-inferior to the MSR modality using light microscopy with respect to major discordance rate with comparing to the main diagnosis. Thus, the study met the primary objective as shown in Table 6.

Three (3) organ types, appendix, gallbladder and hernial/peritoneal, had major discordance rates of $0 . 0 0 \%$ for both modalities. For all organ types, the absolute values of the observed differences in the major discordance rates between WSIR diagnosis and MSR diagnosis (relative to the reference diagnosis) were $\leq 2 . 0 3 \%$ . When examining the major discordance rates, ‘Bladder’ had the highest major discordance rate of $1 0 . 4 0 \%$ for WSIR and $9 . 4 7 \%$ for MSR. However, statistical model showed that the modality-byorgan interaction was not statistically significant.

Secondary analysis of agreement between the WSIR and MSR diagnosis showed that there was also strong agreement between the two modalities. There were 7423 pairs of readings with both adjudication outcomes for WSIR and MSR. Results showed $9 6 . 1 \%$ of the paired readings resulted in no major discordance for both modalities $( 9 4 . 7 \% )$ or major discordance for both modalities $( 1 . 4 7 \% )$ .

The modality-by-organ interaction was not statistically significant. The clinical study was not powered to analyze the results by individual organ site or diagnosis. The number of unbalanced diagnoses in which the WSIR modality had major discordance and the MSR modality had concordance with the reference diagnosis in each tissue/organ type category ranged from 0 cases for kidney to 15 cases in breast, corresponding to $0 . 0 \%$ to $4 . 9 \%$ of the total cases in each organ type group. Similarly, the number of unbalanced diagnoses in which the MSR modality had major discordance and the WSIR modality had concordance with the reference diagnosis in each tissue/organ type category ranged from 0 cases in skin to 13 cases in breast, corresponding to $0 . 0 \%$ to $4 . 3 \%$ of the total cases in each organ type group. Thus, unbalanced diagnoses represented a small percentage of the overall cases and occurred with similar frequency for both modalities. When the specific diagnoses were examined by tissue/organ type, there were no apparent trends in any tissue/organ type that suggested WSIR is more inherently prone to major discrepancies compared to MSR. When examining this data by reading pathologist, none of the reading pathologists showed a tendency to have more types of specific major discrepancies with WSIR as compared to MSR. In every case the observed rates were within the known and established rate of inter-pathologist variation in diagnosis as reported in literature.

With AutoLoader, the scanner automatically loads each slide in the batch to the stage and scans the glass slide to generate WSI image. After the scanning of all slides in the batch is completed, the slides are unloaded from the scanner and stored according to the lab procedure.

# 5. Calibration:

The Aperio AT2 DX scanner is calibrated and verified at the factory before shipment. No further manual calibration or verification is required by the customer. Annual preventive maintenance performed by Leica Biosystems Technical Services is recommended to ensure the scanner is operating correctly. The scanner provides automatic calibration and verification every time a slide is scanned by performing calibration during the scan.

The monitors provided with the Aperio AT2 DX System have been calibrated at the factory and may require periodic re-calibration in the field by authorized Leica Biosystems technicians. The user should not attempt to change the monitor settings as doing so may interfere with the monitor calibration.

The ImageScope DX application does not require calibration.

# 6. Quality Control:

It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to conduct and maintain quality control of the slides per their laboratory standards (e.g., staining, cover-slipping, barcode placement) prior to loading the slides into the Aperio AT2 DX scanner. After completing a scan, the lab technician checks image data and image quality using the Aperio ConsoleDX application installed on the scanner workstation per the instructions for use. Before review, the pathologist performs quality control on the WSI images of the slide per instructions for use.
