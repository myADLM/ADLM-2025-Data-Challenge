Genomic DNA is extracted from tissue specimens using Qiagen’s QIAsymphony DSP DNA MiniK it per manufacturer’s protocol. Matched normal control samples are

processed from blood $2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 2 . 5 \mathrm { m l }$ in PAxGene Blood DNA collection tubes). DNA is quantified and concentrated if necessary. The amount of DNA required to perform the test is 50-300ng. Genomic DNA is stored at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until assay initiation. DNA shearing is conducted per protocol and a quality control check is reviewed. Average fragment size for sheared DNA should be approximately ${ \sim } 2 0 0 \mathrm { b p }$ for tissue and approximately ${ \sim } 3 0 0 \mathrm { b p }$ for blood. Sheared DNA proceeds directly to library preparation.

# 2. Library Preparation

Sequence libraries are prepared using KAPA Biosystems Library Preparation Reagents by first producing blunt-ended, $5 '$ -phosphorylated fragments. To the $_ 3 \cdot$ ends of the dsDNA library fragments, dAMP is added (A-tailing). Next, dsDNA adapters with 3’dTMP is ligated to the A-tailed library fragments. Library fragments with appropriate adapter sequences are amplified via ligation-mediated pre-capture PCR. A quality control review on the amplified DNA libraries is performed: Samples should be a smear with average fragment peak size for tissue as approximately ${ \sim } 2 0 0 \mathsf { b p }$ and average blood peak is approximately ${ \sim } 3 0 0 \mathrm { b p }$ with a fluorescence above 20. The concentration should be10- $3 0 0 \mathrm { n g / \mu L }$ to ensure adequate hybridization for capture.

# 3. Hybrid Capture

Library capture is conducted using IDT Capture reagents. Sequencing libraries are hybridized to the vendor oligo pool. Capture beads are used to pull down the complex of capture oligos and genomic DNA fragments. Unbound fragments are washed away. The enriched fragment pool is amplified by ligation mediated-PCR (LM-PCR). The success of the enrichment is measured as a quality control step: Samples should be a smear with an average peak fragment size for tissue at approximately ${ \sim } 2 0 0 \mathrm { b p }$ and an average peak fragment size for blood at approximately ${ \sim } 3 0 0 \mathrm { b p }$ with a fluorescence above 20. The concentration of the amplified DNA library should be $1 { - } 4 5 \mathrm { n g / \mu L }$ ; the LM-PCR yield should be $\geq 2 5 \mathrm { n g }$ . Reactions can be stored at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ until ready for purification, up to 72 hours.

# 4. Sequencing and Data Analysis

Sequencing is conducted using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing instruments and reagents along with PhiX Control v3. The sequencing process uses multiple quality checks.

a. Data Management System (DMS): Automated sample tracking and archival of runassociated metadata (barcode, samples accession number, requisition number, source (class), and specimen type) is conducted with the following key functions: Tracking sample status through various stages of data analysis; tracking iterations of analysis applied to a given sample; recording versions of databases and algorithms used in analysis; archival of selected pipeline output files (FASTQ, BAM, VCF) and sequencing run statistics (e.g. yield, error rate, unassigned read indices).

b. Demultiplexing and FASTQ Generation: The analysis pipeline uses software provided by Illumina. Multiple pairs of FASTQ files are generated per sample corresponding to full length forward and reverse reads. Demultiplexing quality control includes quality metrics for per-base sequence quality, sequence content, GC content and sequence length distribution, and relative percentages of unmatched indices.

c. Indexing QC Check: The potential for index or sample contamination is managed during mutation calling and determined by looking for the presence of common polymorphisms in tumor samples that are different from the polymorphisms present in the matched-normal equivalent sample.

d. Read Alignment and BAM Generation: Spurious adapter sequences are trimmed prior to read alignment. Reads are aligned in paired-end mode to the Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 37 (GRCh37, aka hg19) version of the human genome. Aligned reads are written to a Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) file, which is then converted into Binary Alignment Map (BAM) format. PCR duplicates are flagged and excluded. Each base within a read is assigned a base quality score by the sequencing software, which reflects the probability an error was made with the base call. To account for systemic biases that may not accurately reflect the actual error probabilities observed empirically, the analysis pipeline uses another tool to adjust the reported quality scores based on the selected covariates. Control for low quality bases during identification as part of variant calling results in low quality reads being excluded.

e. Sample QC Checks: The baits used for hybridization capture include probes targeting ${ > } 2 0 0 { , } 0 0 0$ regions throughout the genome containing common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The unique combination of SNPs specific to a given sample serves as a ‘fingerprint’ for the identity of the corresponding patient, and serves to identify potential sample mix-ups and contamination between samples and barcodes. QC checks involve the use of fingerprint’ SNPs.

i. Sample mix-up check: The analysis pipeline computes the $\%$ Similarity between the normal and tumor samples associated with the same patient, where $\%$ Similarity is defined as the percentage “compatible” genotypes shared by the two samples among a random set of up to 1,000 dbSNP loci with sufficient coverage (coverage depth $\ge 6 0$ in both tumor and normal samples). If the $\%$ Similarity falls below $9 7 \%$ , the tumor and normal samples are flagged for review as potentially mismatched samples.

ii. Sample contamination checks: The percentage of somatic variants that overlap common dbSNP loci (where “common” is defined as a polymorphism with a global population allele frequency $> 5 \%$ ) is calculated $\%$ Common). If $\%$ Common exceeds $5 \%$ of the total somatic variant burden, the sample is flagged for review as potentially contaminated with unrelated DNA.

iii. Check for presence of tumor in normal: Tumor contamination in matched-normal samples is assessed by calculating the number and percentage of somatic calls that meet the following criteria:

1. Two (2) or more reads supporting mutant allele in matched-normal, and   
2. Mutant allele fraction $> 5 \%$ in matched-normal sample.

f. Mutation calling – SNVs and Indels: The analysis pipeline identifies two classes of mutations: (1) single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and (2) indels. Paired sample mutation calling is performed on tumor samples and their respective matched normal controls. Filtering is performed to remove low quality sequence data, sources of sequencing artifacts, and germline results. Summary of mutation filtering scheme is provided in Figure 1.

![](images/5c90a983a2e77cdfd86a06ba8153aaac66434c756f548b728f2478a21824d065.jpg)  
Figure 1: Summary of the mutation filtering scheme for Omics Core

i. Analysis of positive and negative controls: Data from controls is used to confirm lack of contamination as well as analytical sensitivity.

ii. Filters on sample coverage: Sequencing coverage of $\geq 5 0 0 \mathrm { X }$ is required for tumor samples and sequencing coverage of $\ge 1 5 0 \mathrm { X }$ is required for normal samples.

iii. Filtering for high confidence mutations: Raw SNV and indel calls are subjected to a series of filtering steps to ensure only high-confidence calls are reported. These parameters include (1) evidence of it being a somatic mutations (i.e., log odds of tumor data at site explained by presence of somatic mutation vs. sequencing error $>$ 6.3 ${ \tt > } 4 . 3$ for indels) in tumor, log odds of normal data at site explained by sequencing error vs. presence of somatic mutation $> 2 . 2$ , (2) reference set of common artifacts found in 3 or more normal samples from a panel of ${ > } 4 { , } 0 0 0$ normal blood samples, (3) technical characteristics that use coverage depth (DP), number of mutant reads (AD), mutation allele fraction (AF), strand bias (SB), characteristics of reads supporting mutant allele (mismatch quality sum, nearby indels, mapping quality), and characteristics of region where mutant is located (adjacent simple tandem repeat, overlapping dbSNP markers). Omics Core does not report mutations below $2 \%$ .

g. Mutation Annotation Predicted functional effect and clinical interpretation for each mutation is curated by automated software using information from several databases.

# 5. Controls

a. Matched Normal Control: Genomic DNA is extracted from patient-matched normal whole blood. NantHealth requires a normal sample to perform the test.

b. Positive Control: The positive control sample (commercial vendor qualified by NantHealth) contains different confirmed mutations, representing a range of mutation allele frequencies. Results are compared against a negative control as an unmatched normal. Data generated from the positive control sample is analyzed using the pipeline, and frequencies of the detected mutations are reviewed to determine if (1) the known mutations are among those called, and (2) the observed frequencies for the known mutations match their expected values within $10 \%$ . The percentage agreement for scenarios (1) and (2) is expected to be $9 5 \%$ or higher.

c. Negative Control: The negative control sample is a purchased reference sample, verified to be free of tumor contamination and germline copy number mutations in a majority of genes. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) present in the negative control have been identified in prior analyses. The observed genotypes are compared against the expected genotypes for 420 common SNPs, and the degree of concordance is measured by identifying the percentage of SNPs that are identical or compatible. The percentage agreement between expected and observed mutations is expected to be $9 7 \%$ or higher.

d. PCR Reagent Control – No Template Control (NTC): The NTC control should have a quantification measurement of $< 1 . 0 \mathrm { n g / \mu L }$ . If this is not the case, the measurement may be high due to the presence of unincorporated primers carried over from the LM-PCR reaction and not an indication of possible contamination amplified sample libraries. If the quantification measurement $\mathrm { i s } \geq \mathrm { l n g / \mu L }$ and determined not to be due to dimers, the sample will be flagged and reviewed to determine if a re-run or sequencing run is necessary.

# 6. Result Reporting:

• Oncopanel results are reported out under one of the two categories: “Cancer Mutations with Evidence of Clinical Significance” or “Cancer Mutations with Potential Clinical Significance”. The two categories are based on the supporting level of clinical evidence. Refer to the Clinical Performance Section for more information.   
• Results are reported for point mutations and small insertions and deletions in protein-coding exons of the 468 gene panel. Refer to Appendix 1a for a list of genes   
• The Omics Core does not report mutations in 203 exons due to low sequence coverage, poor mapping quality, or high GC content. Refer to Appendix 1b for a list of excluded exons.   
• Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) Reporting: TMB is measured by counting the total number of somatic, non-synonymous exonic variants per the total number of genes (19,396) surveyed by the Omics Core assay. TMB is measured as mutations per megabase (mut/Mb), reported as a rate and included in the category for “Cancer Mutations with Potential Clinical Significance”

# L. Test Principle:

The NantHealth Omics Core assay is a custom targeted sequencing platform, utilizing solution-phase exon capture and sequencing, to detect somatic alterations (point mutations, small insertions and deletions), and overall tumor mutation burden in tumor specimens. The NantHealth Omics Core assay involves hybridization capture and deep sequencing of 468 cancer-associated genes for reporting of variants. TMB is reported on the basis of SNVs in the protein-coding exons of 19,396 genes including all known oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Omics Core reports on 468 genes from within the larger panel, reporting cancer mutations with evidence of clinical significance and cancer mutations with potential for clinical significance.The assay is not cleared for whole exome reporting of individual variants outside of the 468 genes. DNA probes are synthesized by a secondary manufacturer and are biotinylated to enable sequence enrichment through capture by streptavidinconjugated beads. In total, the probes target approximately 39Mb of the human genome.

Genomic DNA is extracted from both a tumor and a patient-matched normal control sample. Sequence libraries are prepared through a series of enzymatic steps including shearing of double-stranded DNA, end repair, A-base addition, ligation of barcoded sequence adaptors, and low cycle PCR amplification. Single barcoded sequence libraries are captured using the biotinylated probes. Captured DNA fragments are then pooled and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 as paired-end reads. Sequence reads are then aligned to the reference human genome. By comparing the identity of bases from the tumor DNA to the matched normal DNA and the reference human genome, somatic alterations are identified in the tumor.

# M. Performance:

# 1. Determination of pipeline thresholds

a. Requirements on exon coverage establishment: A power analysis to compute the coverage or total number of reads needed to detect a mutation with true underlying mutation frequency $2 \%$ or greater, for varying levels of power (0.8 to 0.99), assuming a fixed alpha (Type I error rate) of 0.05 was conducted. Additionally, the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval ranges of observed mutation frequency as a function of coverage was also calculated. When the mutation is present at $10 \%$ , the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval with a coverage of 500X is expected to fall between $7 . 5 \%$ and $1 3 \%$ . When the overall coverage is 100X, the $9 5 \%$ CI for a mutation at $10 \%$ is estimated to fall

between $5 . 0 \%$ and $1 7 . 6 \%$ . To confirm these estimates, empirical data was obtained to measure the range of observed VF to expected VF using DNA from 10 normal FFPE samples from unrelated individuals which was mixed in equimass parts so as to create a range of SNPs with expected frequencies as low as $5 \%$ . A total of 672 common SNPs were considered for this experiment. A boxplot for one of the mixtures, mixture 6, showing the observed mutation frequencies for the 672 common SNPs genotyped in the pooled normal sample binned by their true underlying mutation frequency is shown in Figure 2. The results demonstrated that an observed VAF range of $4 . 2 \%$ to $2 0 . 3 \%$ for a SNP with true underlying mutation frequency of $10 \%$ when the mean coverage of the sample was 968X. This range in values is wider than the expected range of $7 . 5 \%$ to $1 3 \%$ and likely due to slight variations in the true mixing percentages. This data provided support for using a $5 \%$ as the lower limit for reporting mutations detected with true underlying frequency of $10 \%$ . The increased VAF range observed at the expected $10 \%$ frequency was also shown to be due to the different protocols and methods used for specimens sent to NantHealth e.g., fixation time, storage conditions, etc. These processing variations manifest as variable DNA damage and impact the sample DNA to library conversion rate (conversion efficiency), and thus result in differing sample representation within both a mixture of samples and the final sequencing data.

The boxplot in Figure 2 shows a correlation of 0.983, with a slope of .997 and intercept of -0.0096. Consistent correlation is established as ${ > } 0 . 9$ as for the whole pool analyzed.

Figure 2. Observed vs Expected Variant Frequency

b. Requirements on sample coverage: Ten normal (diploid) FFPE samples were profiled in duplicate using the Omics Core assay (total $= 2 0$ replicates) to generate summary statistics across all targeted exons. The mean coverage across all targeted exons for the normal FFPE samples was 810X $\mathrm { \Delta S D } = 1 0 6 \mathrm { X } )$ . Summary statistics were also computed on coverage values per exon normalized by per-sample coverage. There were exons that presented with consistently low coverage values, due to sequence similarity with other loci and high GC content; however, none of those exons were among the clinical validation genes and were removed from the Omics Core assay. Of the remaining exons across all genes, $9 9 . 9 \%$ were sequenced to a depth of 100X or greater while $9 1 . 2 \%$ were sequenced to a depth of 250X or greater. This analysis of normal FFPE samples indicates that with a mean sample coverage of 810X, $9 8 \%$ of exons are sequenced with coverage greater than 170X, or with normalized coverage greater than 0.21. (The ‘mean-normalized coverage’ is the coverage of the mutation divided by the mean coverage across all exons; it serves as a measure of how deeply the validation exon was sequenced relative to the overall coverage of the sample. A mean-normalized coverage below 1 indicates the exon coverage is below average; conversely if greater than 1, it indicates above average coverage.) The data are shown in Figure 3a and 3b.

![](images/127901e4c521260a922c1c422d9c832725f65230b70700b282ed818d52b6526a.jpg)

Figure 3a. Distribution of mean coverage values for targeted exons normalized by per- sample coverage. (Dashed line indicates $20 \%$ of mean sample coverage).

Based on the calculations, $9 8 \%$ of exons can be expected to be sequenced to coverage greater than 100X, when mean sample coverage is 476X $( 0 . 2 1 * 4 7 6 \mathrm { X } = 1 0 0 \mathrm { X } )$ . (A 100X minimum coverage threshold per exon is required based on the power calculations, which showed 100X coverage was necessary to call mutations with true underlying mutation frequency $10 \%$ or greater, with $9 5 \%$ power at an alpha level of 0.05).

To be conservative, a threshold of 500X on mean sample coverage is used to determine if a sample is sequenced to sufficient depth for subsequent analysis. A sample is flagged as being at increased risk of false negatives it its mean coverage is below 500X.

To provide empirical data for these requirements, NantHealth utilizes the pooled normal FFPE sample with known expected single nucleotide mutations ${ \bf \Pi } _ { \mathrm { n } } = 9 7 4$ ) and the underlying mutation allele fractions (MAF). In silico downsampling analysis was conducted with a pooled normal mixture down to $46 \%$ where the sample coverage decreased from 968X to 450X. At this coverage level, 135 of the 139 $9 7 \%$ ; $9 3 { - } 9 9 \%$ CI) mutations with expected underlying MAF of $10 \%$ were called.

c. Requirements on mutation calling threshold: Permissive standard filters were used to intentionally generate false positives to identify suitable thresholds for parameters such as variant frequency (VF) and heuristic filters to optimize specificity. The following criteria allows optimal rejection of false positive SNVs and indel calls, while maintaining the ability to detect true positive events with underlying frequency of $10 \%$ $5 \mathrm { - } 1 7 . 6 \%$ observable). Potential strand-bias and heuristic filters (ctl, laf, mq0, np, str, end, tri, idl, grm, phs) are also evaluated in the standard somatic mutation

calling pipeline. An example of the number of false positive events detected pre and post filtering for the mixture sample using the standard somatic mutation calling pipeline is shown in Table 4.

# 2. Pre-analytical Performance

Table 5 below displays the invalid rates across 42 different tumor types (in FFPE) gathered from in-house historical data from testing $> 2 0 0 0$ samples. The data shows the separate invalid rates for the different steps involved in the assay including the percentage of specimens with insufficient tumor, the percentage with failed library prep and the percentage that failed the sequencing run per cancer type. The range of invalid rates was $0 . 0 \%$ to $3 3 . . 3 3 \%$ which were principally due to insufficient tumor and related to the specimen source. Invalid results due to sequencing failures were below $7 . 2 \%$ except for pancreas which was twice that but still acceptable. The data shows that the DNA extraction is valid across tumor types and interference effects from different specimens are not significant across different tumor types supporting the performance of the pancancer specimen handling.

# 3. Analytical Performance:

The hybridization-capture-based targeted sequencing assay is designed to detect point mutations [also referred to as single nucleotide variants (SNVs)] as well as small insertions/deletions (indels) $< 2 1$ bp in length in the coding exons of 468 genes (See Appendix 1 and 2). A paired-sample analysis pipeline (tumor vs. matched normal blood) is used to identify somatic mutations in the targeted exons. A representative approach to validation of the SNVs and indels targeted in this panel was submitted at the variant level, and asseside quality metrics (data not shown).

# a. Precision Studies

Reproducibility and repeatability were assessed in precision studies for Omics Core. Extracted DNA was run once per day for 3 non-consecutive days using different barcodes for inter-day assessment $( \mathtt { n } = 3 )$ . For one run, a sample was run in triplicate for intra-day assessment, resulting in a total of $3 + 1 + 1 = 5$ replicates. For each replicate tested, all observed mutations in the selected genes were reported and assessed for precision. Details of the studies are described below.

i. Precision Panel: The precision of Omics Core was assessed using 12 FFPE clinical tumor samples and 1 commercial cell line $( { \tt n } = 1 3 )$ ). The panel represented different tumor types, different mutation types, and a range of mutant allele frequencies. The specimen panel was selected based on known mutations corresponding to “Cancer Mutations with Evidence of Clinical Significance.” Table 6 shows the list of specimens used in this study. A total of 530 variants were identified in the clinical and cell line samples that included 483 SNVs, 32 deletions and 15 insertions. Precision of each variant is reported across all samples to provide an assessment of the error rate.

ii. Precision – Panel-Wide Reproducibility: The precision was reported for all detected mutants in all replicates for each sample. The results demonstrate that the overall positive call rate for all variants analyzed across the 12 FFPE clinical samples and one commercial cell line was 2607/2650, or $9 8 . 4 \%$ $9 7 . 8 – 9 8 . 8 \% \mathrm { C l }$ I). The coefficient of variation $( \% C V )$ for the mutation allele frequency was calculated for all 5 replicates. Three-hundred and ninety-eight (398) of 521 $( 7 6 \% )$ mutations in the clinical specimens had $\% { \mathrm { C V } } \leq 1 0 \%$ ; 91 of 521 $( 1 7 \% )$ were between 10 and $20 \%$ ; and 32 of 521 $( 6 \% )$ were $> 2 0 \%$ . Discordance was observed for variants in the following genes as summarized in Table 7 below. Each specimen is separated by a dark gray line. Known mutation within each specimen are in bold. Discordant cases are denoted in light grey. All runs passed the quality metrics criteria.

iii. Precision – Per-Specimen Precision: Precision was calculated for each individual specimen as shown in Table 8. Results from the precision studies were combined across all reportable genes for each specimen. The positive call rate was calculated based on the total number of mutations along with the two-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence interval. The results showed that all mutations have $100 \%$ concordance for 511 out of 530 unique mutations, or $9 6 . 4 \%$ $9 4 . 5 \% 9 7 . 8 \% \mathrm { C l }$ I).

The results showed that all mutations have $100 \%$ concordance in all replicates except for 19 mutations in 5 of the clinical specimens. In the clinical specimens, discordance was observed for 15 SNVs, 2 deletions, and 2 insertions.

1 Positive call rate was calculated based on variants with majority call detected as positive. 2 Negative call rate was calculated based on variants detected at least once, but with majority call as negative. For all other locations, the negative call rates are $100 \%$ .

iv. Precision – Well-Characterized Reference Material: The precision of Omics Core was also assessed through repeated measurements of the reference material NA12878 (pre-extracted DNA provided by Coriell Institute). Table 9 below summarizes precision data (agreement on variant calls across all replicates) binned by GC content (e.g., $0 . 5 \%$ , $5 \mathrm { - } 1 0 \%$ , $1 0 { - } 2 5 \% 2 5 { - } 5 0 \% , > 5 0 \% )$ and provide additional precision data on key quality metrics. The positive call rate for all 420 variants across all 20 passing replicates was 8,388 out of 8400, or $9 9 . 8 6 \%$ $( 9 9 . 7 5 \% - 9 9 . 9 3 \%$ CI).

# b. Analytical Sensitivity - Limit of Detection (LoD)

# i. LoD –SNVs and Indels

The LoD of the Omics Core assay is defined as the mutant allele fraction at which $9 5 \%$ of replicates for a variant type are reliably detected, of the Omics Core assay was evaluated by assessing a minimum of ten (10) FFPE clinical tumor samples from clinical cases across a diverse set of cancers. Specimens were selected for mutations with evidence of clinical significance for SNVs, small insertions and deletions. The LoD study was comprised of two steps: LoD establishment, sequencing of a specific variant over a dilution series, and LoD confirmation, sequencing of a specific variant at the established LoD.

Part1: Dilution Series: For LoD establishment, mutations in 5 exons with the lowest and highest coverage were assessed based on the mean normalized coverage for all exons within the 10 FFPE clinical samples.The 5 exons with lowest coverage correspond to 3 exons harboring SNVs, ATM exon 17 (F858L), TP53 exon 11 (R248W), and BRAF exon 17 (V600E), and 2 exons harboring indels, KIT exon 9 and PIK3CA exon 2. The 5 exons with highest coverage correspond to 3 exons harboring SNVs, FGFR3 exon 7 (S249C), ANKRD11 exon 13 (S1790L), and ASXL2 exon 11 (E722Q), and 2 exons harboring indels, MSH3 exon 1 and SOX9 exon 3. Table 11 sumarizes the samples used for this evaluation.

Five serial dilutions were prepared using patient samples positive for the mutations listed above, where tumor samples were diluted with a previously sequenced, unmatched normal FFPE sample created from a well-characterized cell line. One replicate at each dilution was tested and the ability to detect the mutation of interest was measured.

The results of the dilution series established precedence for Omics Core to call variants down to the $5 \%$ mutant allele frequency. A fully ranked list of all variants by their expected allele frequencies is shown in Tables 12A-12J , which demonstrate the successful detection of all variants estimated at $3 . 7 5 \%$ and above.

Part 2: Confirmation of the LoD. Based on the LoD dilution series, a total of 5 replicates were tested for each of the 3 deletions, 4 insertions, and 6 SNVs at $5 \%$ mutant allele frequency. Table 13 summarizes the specimens and genes assessed for the LoD confirmation study. In the LoD confirmation study, replicates for all variants had $100 \%$ positive call rates except for one replicate for a SNV on BAP1 exon 16. This replicate was detected but failed to meet the variant confidence threshold established for reporting. A summary of the data per variant evaluated, including the mutation, the gene and exon, range for DP, AD, MAF, NormDP, and positive call rate is shown in Table 13. The results of the LoD establishment and confirmation study demonstrate Omics Core’s ability to detect and reliably call each variant class at the $5 \%$ mutant allele frequency with a success rate of $\ge 9 5 \%$ . SNVs were called at $9 6 . 7 \%$ $8 2 . 8 \% . 9 9 . 9 \% \mathrm { C I }$ ), insertions at $100 \%$ $8 3 . 2 \% \cdot$ - $1 0 0 . 0 \% \mathrm { C I } $ ) and deletions at $1 0 0 . 0 \%$ $7 8 . 2 \% - 1 0 0 . 0 \% \mathrm { C I } )$ .

# ii. LoD – Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB):

Ten (10) FFPE tumor specimens with a tumor purity of $\leq 2 0 \%$ , as assessed by a board certified pathologist, were selected for TMB analysis. Five (5) replicates of each tumor specimen were analyzed by the Omics Core assay and TMB was calculated for all fifty (50) replicates surveyed by the Omics Core assay.

Table 14 demonstrates consistent reproducibility and repeatability of the Omics Core TMB assay with minimum tumor content representing tumor purities as low as $10 \%$ . The Omics Core assay will evaluate and report TMB rates for clinical samples with tumor purities $\ge 2 0 \%$ . All samples evaluated in the precision analyses had a $\% C V <$ $10 \%$ .

A DNA Input study demonstrated the analytical performance of the Omics Core assay across a range of DNA input $( 5 0 - 3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g } )$ in representative FFPE tumor types. A total of 11 FFPE clinical samples and one commercial cell line were assessed at six different DNA inputs (50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and $3 0 0 \mathrm { n g }$ ).

Analytical performance was assessed for mutations identified in the precision study. The positive call rate was assessed for each DNA input from 11 FFPE clinical samples and a commercial cell line. A summary assessment of analytical performance for each DNA input range is shown in Table 14.

# iv. DNA Input – TMB:

TMB was measured using 11 undiluted samples across a range of DNA inputs (50 - 300 ng) (Table 15). A total of 110 sequencing runs demonstrated a $\% \mathrm { C V }$ of $< 1 0 \%$ for all 11 samples assessed (10 replicates each) (Results shown in Table 10). Figure 4 presents TMB calculation for each of the 11 samples at the respective DNA inputs in a scatter plot showing TMB score as a function of DNA input. The data demonstrate that the Omics Core TMB calculation is consistent when evaluating multiple tumor types across varying DNA inputs.

c. Linearity /assay reportable range:

Not applicable

d. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

i. Traceability:

The Omics Core is not traceable to any known standard. Controls and quality metrics are described in the device description section.

# ii. Stability:

Reagent stability is based on manufacturer expiration dating and is supported through NantHealth verification protocols. Stability of the reagents is also monitored through the use of the quality metrics and consistent output for controls.

iii. Expected values:

The laboratory has established baseline quality control values and metrics for the reporting of somatic variants claimed by this assay.

# e. Analytical Specificity

High analytical specificity is maintained by paired/tumor matched normal sequencing and was established during assay optimization.

Interference: The Omics Core assay is designed to minimize interference from exogenous sources. The invalid sequencing rates across 42 tumor types supports that interference is minimized.

# f. Assay Cut-off

The Omics Core does not report mutations below $2 \%$ variant allele frequency. Mutations included in the calculation of TMB must be present at $5 \%$ allele frequency or greater.

# g. Comparison Studies

# i. Method Comparison-SNVs, Insertions and Deletions

The accuracy of the Omics Core assay was assessed by comparing Omics Core results to results obtained from the orthogonal method. A total of 401 FFPE tumor samples from clinical cases across a diverse set of cancers were used in this analysis, representing mutations covering 2,634 SNVs, 125 small insertions, and 313 small deletions.

The results of the comparison study demonstrate the accuracy of the Omics Core assay by successfully detecting mutations in 401 out of the 401 samples, representing an accuracy of $100 \%$ $( 9 9 . 0 8 \mathrm { - } 1 0 0 . 0 0 \% \mathrm { C l }$ I). There were 3 false positives across 2 genes and 8 false negatives across 8 genes. A total of 3072

unique mutations in 401 FFPE tumor specimens representing 1835 exons in 471 genes were tested and are listed in Appendix 2.

Omics Core accuracy study2 included 2634 unique SNVs demonstrated a PPA of $9 9 . 7 6 \%$ $9 9 . 5 0 { - } 9 9 . 9 0 \% \mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ I), PPV of $9 9 . 9 3 \%$ $( 9 9 . 7 5 { \scriptstyle - 9 9 . 9 9 \% } \mathrm { C I }$ ); 125 unique small insertions (ranging from 1 bp to $1 2 { \mathsf { b p } }$ ) demonstrated a PPA of $100 \%$ (97.20- $1 0 0 . 0 0 \%$ CI), PPV of $100 \%$ $( 9 7 . 2 0 \mathrm { - } 1 0 0 . 0 0 \% \mathrm { C I } )$ ; and 313 unique small deletions (ranging from 1 bp to 61 bp) demonstrated a PPA of $9 9 . 7 1 \%$ $( 9 8 . 3 8 \mathrm { - } 9 9 . 9 9 \% \mathrm { C l }$ ), PPV of $9 9 . 7 1 \%$ $( 9 8 . 3 8 \mathrm { - } 9 9 . 9 9 \% \mathrm { C I }$ ). To adjust for sampling prevalence, adjusted PPA was provided (All data $100 \%$ except where indicated). Calculating adjusted PPA requires estimation of the prevalence of positives which was estimated for the set of all variants tested, as well as a per-gene for the set of variants in a singe gene. Results are shown in Tables 15A-15C below separated by SNVs, insertions and deletions.

# ii. Accuracy (Method Comparison- Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB)

Tumor mutation burden (TMB) by Omics Core is reported as an estimate of mutation rate by counting all somatic, synonymous and non-synonymous variants detected in gene coding regions and dividing by the approximate size of the exome $( 3 3 . 7 \mathrm { M b } )$ . TMB is reported as mutations per megabase (mut/Mb) unit. Mutations included in the calculation of TMB must be present at $5 \%$ allele frequency or greater after direct comparison of tumor

DNA with matched normal DNA. TMB accuracy was assessed by comparing the TMB rates generated by Omics Core and the orthogonal method. A linear regression was performed to calculate slope, intercept, and correlation between samples. This analysis identified a number of samples with higher than expected mutation rates after sequencing and variant calling by a Reference Call Lab. Further analysis revealed 58 of the 401 samples had homopolymer insertions (runs of A, C, G, or T with a minimum length of 4 bases, e.g. NF8:c.450_451insAAAAAAAAAAAAAA) unique to the GENEWIZ sample at rates higher than expected $( > 1 0 \% )$ , indicating a potential sample quality issue in the extended exome beyond the 468 genes of interest being used for reporting on Omics Core. The resulting 343 samples were then used to compare, showing higher concordance between Omics Core and GENEWIZ, with $\mathrm { R } 2 = 0 . 9 7 7 8$ . NantHealth excluded samples under the 250X exome coverage target designed in the study and observed a higher correlation between both sets of samples, with $\mathrm { R } 2 = 0 . 9 9 8 6$ . A scatter plot demonstrating the high correlation $( \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 8 9 9 )$ ) between Omics Core and the orthogonal method, is presented in Figure 5.

Figure 5: Omics Core Exonic Mutation Rate per Megabase Using Orthogonal Method Variant Calls

The following tables (Tables 16A-16D) provide a comparison of whole exome calls between the samples sequenced by Omics Core and the Reference Lab used in the final TMB analysis. In order to account for the lower targeted depth and lack of matchednormal in the Reference Lab callset, the following filters were used to exclude calls made by either Omics Core or the Reference Lab: $\mathrm { A F } < 5 \%$ , AD $< = 2$ reads, present in Matched

Normal (using matched-normal germline sequencing data as determined by Omics Core), and $\%$ of MQ0 reads $> 5 0 \%$ . The calls that remained for Omics Core or the Reference Lab were classified as “Positive” calls, while calls not made by one platform (but called by the other) were classified as “Negative” if the position was within a region targeted by the platform’s exome kit (i.e., had sequencing data covering the position) or “No Call” if the position was not (i.e. no sequencing data covered the position). The sets of Positive, Negative, and No Call variants were then split by variant type (All variants, SNVs, Insertions, and Deletions) and intersected to determine the numbers in the following tables (16A- 16D) and calculated the PPA, NPA, and their respective confidence intervals.

# iii. Supplemental Method Comparison Study for Wild-type Calls

A supplemental analysis was conducted to assess accuracy for a set of 32 hotspot variant positions from 12 genes within all samples. Omics Core results for all variant positions were compared to results obtained with the orthogonal method. Within the 401 specimens, there were 220 mutations across all samples and 12,612 wild-type calls. Discordant variants included 1 mutation observed in Omics Core and 1 mutation observed in the orthogonal method. The supplemental assay, which analyzed 220 positive mutations and 12,612 wild-type calls, demonstrated a PPA of $9 9 . 5 4 \%$ $( 9 7 . 4 8 \mathrm { - } 9 9 . 9 9 \% \mathrm { C I }$ ) and NPA of $9 9 . 9 9 \%$ $( 9 9 . 9 9 - 1 0 0 . 0 0 \% \mathrm { C I } )$ .

# 4. Clinical Performance:

The Omics Core assay is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test that uses targeted next generation sequencing of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue matched with a normal blood specimen from the patient with solid malignant neoplasms to detect tumor gene alterations in a broad multi gene panel. The genes in the panel include those that play a role in cancer pathogenesis and tumor suppression, or for clinical or mechanistic information of relevance in the management of cancer patients. The assay reports mutations under two categories: “Cancer Mutations with Evidence of Clinical Significance” and “Cancer Mutations with Potential Clinical Significance” consistent with the intended use clinical settings. Mutations with evidence of clinical significance are represented in professional guidelines as established by consensus opinion of experts in the healthcare community.

The NantHealth Omics Core report uses structured information stored within the Omics Core curation database, a manually curated knowledge base that includes biologic, clinical and therapeutic information curated from professional guidelines and recommendations, therapeutic labeling, disease specific expert and advocacy group recommendations, and medical literature. Classification criteria were developed by Omics Core to communicate the level of clinical evidence available for individual mutations including TMB in the test report. The mutations are reported under the two categories (i.e., “Cancer Mutations with Evidence of Clinical Significance” and “Cancer Mutations with Potential Clinical Significance”) based on pre-specified curtation classification criteria.NantHealth periodically updates Omics Core through the review of new information available.
