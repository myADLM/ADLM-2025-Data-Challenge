# 5. Sample Preparation:

The PGDx elio tissue complete assay requires genomic DNA isolated from FFPE tissue specimens. The tumor volume and minimum tumor content needed to obtain sufficient DNA for testing to achieve stated performance are shown in Table 3. If less than $100 \%$ of the tissue section contains $2 0 \%$ tumor purity, the tissue should be macro-dissected to select as much viable tumor as possible and minimize the amount of adjacent non-tumor tissue.

# 6. DNA Extraction:

PGDx elio tissue complete assay requires genomic DNA isolated from FFPE tissue using an appropriate commercially available DNA extraction method. DNA extraction kits should be able to yield $5 0 \mathrm { n g }$ of DNA with a minimum concentration of $1 \mathrm { n g / \mu L }$ . The recommended DNA input for PGDx elio tissue complete is $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g }$ of total DNA recovered from tissue with a minimum $20 \%$ viable tumor nuclei. While recommended DNA input for the assay is $1 0 0 \mathrm { n g } .$ , results can be obtained with DNA inputs down to $5 0 \mathrm { n g }$ . The assay has been validated with extracted DNA stored at $\leq - 2 0 { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 9 months.

# 7. Library Preparation:

The PGDx elio tissue complete assay workflow begins with genomic DNA. Genomic DNA is quantified using a fluorometer. DNA molecules are mechanically sheared to a target size of 200 bp and subjected to a magnetic bead purification step to remove smaller fragments and perform an exchange of buffer. Fragmented DNA is end-repaired, phosphorylated, and adenylated. Indexed adapters are then ligated to the A-tailed DNA molecules.

Unincorporated adapters and reagents are removed by magnetic bead purification. Adapterligated DNA is enriched by PCR amplification. Primer dimers and residual reagents are removed by magnetic bead purification. Library quality is assessed using a DNA fragment analyzer prior to hybrid capture. Sample libraries must ${ \mathsf { b e } } \geq 1 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / \mu L } }$ within the 180-800 bp range with the average peak size $\ge 2 5 0$ bp in length, and external control (EC) for the batch must be $\geq 1 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / \mu L } }$ within the 180-800 bp range with the average peak size $\ge 2 5 0$ bp in length, prior to proceeding to hybridization / target enrichment.

# 8. Hybrid Capture NGS:

The adapter-ligated library is hybridized with biotinylated RNA library baits and targeted regions are captured using magnetic streptavidin coated beads. Captured DNA libraries are purified to remove baits and incompletely hybridized DNA fragments. Captured libraries are enriched by PCR amplification. Primer dimers and residual reagents are removed by magnetic bead purification. Final library quality is assessed using a DNA fragment analyzer prior to sequencing. Samples and external control must be $: \geq 1 0 ~ \mathrm { n M }$ within the 180-800 bp range with the average size $\ge 2 5 0$ bp in length. If the level of primer/adapter dimers in sample library lanes (100-180 bp region) is $> 5 \%$ of the library yield, the library has failed QC and steps starting from library preparation must be repeated.

# 9. Sequencing:

Sample libraries are quantified and normalized into a sequencing pool of up to 15 samples and an external control. Partial batches are supported using a filler of diverse material, such as PGDx elio diversiPhi, or previously captured libraries. Pooled sample libraries are fluorometrically quantified, loaded on a sequencing flow cell, and sequenced.

# 10. Data Analysis:

a) Data Management System (DMS): Sequence data is automatically processed using the PGDx elio platform software that tracks sample names, sample metadata and

processing status from sequencing through to analysis and reporting. Reports of identified alterations are available in a web-based user interface for download. Sequencing and sample metrics are available in run and case reports, including sample and sequencing quality.

b) Demultiplexing and FASTQ Generation: Demultiplexing software generates FASTQ files containing sequence reads and quality scores for each of the samples on a sequencing run. The FASTQ formatted data files are used for subsequent processing of samples.

c) Indexing QC check: Samples are checked for an expected yield of sequence reads identified to detect mistakes in pooling samples. Samples outside the expected range are marked as failed.

d) Read Alignment and BAM Generation: Genome alignment is performed to map sequence reads for each sample to the human reference genome (hg19/GRCh37). Alignments are saved as Binary Alignment Map (BAM) formatted files, which contain read placement information relative to the reference genome with quality scores. Aligned BAM files are further processed in a pipeline to identify genomic alterations.

e) Sample QC checks: Samples are checked for possible contamination through a bioinformatic analysis of genome haplotypes, based on an analysis of pre-defined SNP sites that are characteristic of populations and individuals. Samples containing more than one haplotype are considered potentially contaminated and are marked as failed. Sequence coverage is assessed across the panel requiring $90 \%$ of targeted regions with a minimum ${ \displaystyle \mathrm { > } 1 0 0 \mathbf { x } }$ coverage.

f) Mutation calling: A fully automated pipeline for bioinformatic analysis is used to identify genomic alterations, including SNVs, indels, select amplifications and translocations, and MSI, and TMB.

i. SNVs and Indels: Candidate mutations are evaluated and filtered for characteristics of high confidence somatic variants, including mutant allele frequency, sequence coverage and quality, genomic context, functional annotation, germline status, and prevalence in a database of normal controls. A minimum of 4 or 6 mutant observations and $0 . 4 \%$ , $2 \%$ , or $5 \%$ mutant allele fraction (MAF) are required depending on sequence coverage and status of the variant as a Variant with Evidence of Clinical Significance, somatic hotspot, or a Variant with Potential Clinical Significance. SNVs with lower bound $9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval $< 5 \%$ MAF based on sequence coverage are excluded from reporting. Common germline mutations present in dbSNP, ExAC, and gnomAD are identified and excluded from reporting. Additional germline mutations with $\geq$ 3 matches in ExAC and $\mathrm { M A F } \geq 2 0 \%$ are also excluded from reporting.

ii. Amplifications: The assay is validated to detect ERBB2 amplification. The amplification is identified based on comparing normalized sequence coverage against a collection of normal controls run by PGDx elio tissue complete. A fold change from diploid is estimated from the observed change in coverage combined with an in-silico prediction of tumor purity. ERBB2 gene amplifications are

reported when predicted fold $> 2 . 5 \mathrm { { x } }$ are observed in ${ > } 2 5 \%$ of evaluated regions of interest for the gene. The test is validated for reporting only amplifications in the ERBB2 gene.

iii. Translocations: The assay is validated to report 4 translocations only, ALK, RET and NTRK2, NTRK3. Translocations are identified based on observations of reads supporting gene fusions in genomic alignments of discordantly mapped or split read pairs.

iv. Microsatellite instability: Microsatellite instability is assessed from select mononucleotide tracts and signatures of genomic context from sequence mutations. A linear classifier determines an overall case status of microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), microsatellite stable (MSS), or indeterminate by combining the frequency of unstable tracts and signatures of observed mutations.

v. Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB): TMB is calculated based on detected sequence mutations and indels. Filtering of sequence mutations is performed to exclude low mutant allele fraction mutations ( $65 \%$ MAF), common somatic driver mutations, and common germline mutations. Both synonymous and non-synonymous alterations are considered for the mutation load. TMB is reported as the number of mutations per megabase (Muts/Mb)

# 11. Controls:

a) Negative Control: A no template control (NTC) can be processed to serve as a negative control to validate the acceptability of all the test samples processed through library preparation and capture steps by testing for sample or reagent contamination. The NTC is not included on the sequencing run.

b) Positive Control: An external control that is provided in the PGDx elio tissue complete assay reagent kit consists of cell line derived-DNA with multiple verified sequence mutations. The external control is processed from library preparation through sequencing to serve as an end to end control to demonstrate assay performance. The external control is checked for quality during library preparation and after sequencing. Failure of the external control to meet the pre-defined quality metrics will result in all test samples on the run being reported as “No result.”

# 12. Result Reporting:

PGDx elio tissue complete reports SNVs and indels in protein coding regions across all genes in the panel. In addition, amplifications are reported for ERBB2 as well as translocations for ALK, RET, NTRK2, and NTRK3. Germline mutations, including common polymorphisms in the population, present in dbSNP v150, ExAC v0.3.1, and gnomAD v2.0.2, are filtered and excluded from reports. SNVs and indels that are not Variants with Evidence of Clinical Significance or hotspots will also be removed from reporting if they have $\geq 3$ ExAC hits and have a MAF $\ge 2 0 \%$ . The assay also reports on two genomic signatures, MSI and TMB.

Variants are reported in one of two levels of evidence1 : Variants with Evidence of Clinical Significance and Variants with Potential Clinical Significance. Variants reported as having evidence of clinical significance are defined by AMP/ASCO/CAP guidelines (Li et al., 2017), specifically, variants meeting Tier 1A evidence. The variants listed in the section Variants with Evidence of Clinical Significance are determined based on the selected tumor type. Only variants clinically associated with the tested tumor type will appear in the Variants with Evidence of Clinical Significance section. Any remaining detected variants will appear as the Variants with Potential Clinical Significance. Any variants clinically associated with tumor types other than the one selected will be reported in the section labeled 'Variants with Potential Clinical Significance. A list of all 505 genes is provided in Appendix A and a list of excluded exons in the genes or excluded regions due to challenging regions (e.g., low complexity/repeats) is provided in Appendix B and Appendix C, respectively .

Reporting software was designed to mask results that have low confidence allele frequencies levels near the calling threshold. The PGDx elio tissue complete analytical pipeline calculates a $9 5 \%$ CI around the estimated MAF for all sequence mutations. PGDx has applied a reporting filter to mask Level 3 non-hotspot SNV calls that have a lower bound $9 5 \%$ CI $65 \%$ MAF. By taking this approach, unreliable results at low MAF are filtered out of reporting, while high confidence calls in this range will still be reported.

Indeterminates: For select genes and regions, quality metrics are assessed to check for low coverage or incomplete data needed to identify an alteration. Indeterminate status is reported when 1) no evidence of the alteration was found, but minimum coverage was not met to support the verified limit of detection, or 2) insufficient evidence of the alteration was observed, but minimum coverage thresholds were not met to report the variant. Supporting evidence of detected alterations and coverage in read data is available in the Complete Case Record (CCR). Indeterminate status is reported when evidence of a sequence mutation is observed in regions of low coverage below $< 8 0 \mathrm { x }$ . Indeterminate status is also reported for select genes and codons when low coverage is observed and there is no evidence of an alteration. The minimum coverage threshold range is $1 1 6 \mathrm { x } - 2 4 8 \mathrm { x }$ in cases where select genes and codons are called negative.

# 13. Quality Metrics

Reporting takes in account the quality metrics outlined in Table 4. Quality metrics are assessed across the following categories:

Batch-level: Metrics that are quantified per sequencing run; failing batch-level metrics generates “No result” reports samples failing these criteria. If the external control fails these criteria, “No result” is reported for the entire batch of samples.   
• Sample-level: Metrics that are quantified per sample; generates “No result” report for a sample failing QC.   
• Analyte-level: Metrics that are quantified for individual alteration types and positions, such as sequence coverage. Variants passing analyte-level QC are reported.

# B Principle of Operation:

PGDx elio™ tissue complete is an in vitro diagnostic assay that uses targeted next generation sequencing to detect tumor gene alterations in genomic DNA isolated from formalin- fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue in a 505 gene panel. PGDx elio tissue complete targets cancer-associated genes that are enriched from genomic libraries using a hybrid capture-based chemistry. Genomic libraries are prepared and captured. Samples are pooled for sequencing. After sequencing, automated software executes a bioinformatics analysis pipeline to identify genomic alterations in sequence data. The PGDx elio tissue complete assay workflow does not use a patient-matched normal sample but filters polymorphisms using databases. A summary of the alterations found, including a PDF case report, are reported in output files and provided in a user interface as part of the PGDx elio platform software.

# C Determination of assay thresholds:

# 1. Requirements on exon coverage:

A power analysis was conducted to determine the sequence coverage necessary to detect mutations with true underlying MAFs as low as $2 \%$ . Statistical power was estimated based on a requirement of 4 mutant observations to make a positive call. Sequence coverage of ${ \ > } 4 0 0 \mathbf { x }$ provides $9 5 \%$ statistical power for detection of true mutations at $2 \%$ MAF $9 5 \%$ CI, $0 . 8 \% - 3 . 5 \%$ MAF). For mutations with $5 \%$ underlying MAF, sequence coverage of $> 1 5 0 \mathrm { x }$ provides $9 5 \%$ statistical power for detection $9 5 \%$ CI, $2 . 0 \% 8 . 6 \%$ MAF).

Summary statistics were calculated for individual exons across a cohort of samples to identify exons with consistent below-target coverage. These regions were removed from PGDx elio tissue complete and are not included in variant analysis or reporting.

Additional repeat and low complexity regions are also excluded from reporting. The excluded regions are listed in Appendix B and Appendix C. No Variants with Evidence of Clinical Significance or somatic hotspot mutations are masked from reports.

Sequence coverage was evaluated in the remaining regions across a cohort of 175 FFPE samples, and $9 9 . 5 \%$ of targeted regions (6,991 of 7,026 regions) were sequenced to a depth of $1 0 0 \mathrm { x }$ or greater with $59 8 \%$ of all regions sequenced to a depth of $2 5 0 \mathrm { x }$ or greater. Regions with somatic hotspot mutations exhibited sequence coverage ${ > } 2 5 0 \mathrm { x }$ . Prediction of tumor mutation burden was maintained in low coverage samples, as demonstrated by low variability across replicates in simulations with coverage loss of up to $10 \%$ of exons. Overall, coefficient of variation (CV) estimates are below $2 5 . 6 \%$ , with an average CV of $1 1 . 7 \%$ . Excluding TMB scores below limit of blank (LoB), CV estimates are below $20 \%$ .

# 2. Requirements on sample coverage:

Sequence coverage was evaluated across a range of FFPE samples $\mathrm { \Delta } ( { \mathrm { n } } { = } 1 7 5$ across 8 different tissue types) to obtain sample summary statistics. Overall sample coverage was high in targeted regions of interest (Figure 1; Figure 1 shows a bar graph demonstrating the mutant frequency relative to the mean read depth) with high percentage of targeted exons covered (Figure 2). The mean coverage across all targeted regions for the FFPE samples was $9 1 5 \mathrm { x }$ $\mathrm { ( S D = } 3 7 5$ ).

Sequence coverage was further evaluated to establish minimum criteria for the analysis and reporting of variants. Based on a power analysis, a minimum sequence coverage of $1 0 0 \mathrm { x }$ is necessary to call mutations with true underlying mutation frequency of $8 \%$ or greater. The number of exons for an individual sample meeting this coverage threshold was evaluated to established a per sample threshold. The samples evaluated included a range of DNA quality estimates based on DNA fragment analysis. Of 175 samples evaluated, $59 \%$ of samples (171 of 175 samples) demonstrated $\geq 1 0 0 \mathbf { x }$ coverage across at least $90 \%$ of targeted regions of interest (Figure 3 and Figure 4). The consistently high coverage supports tolerance of occasional low coverage regions that may be seen with varying sample quality. A threshold of $90 \%$ of Regions of Interest (ROIs) with at least $1 0 0 \mathrm { x }$ coverage was selected and is used to determine if a sample is sequenced to sufficient depth for analysis and reporting.

3. Requirements on mutation coverage, allele depth and frequency for positive calls:

Variant calling parameters such as sequence coverage, mutation coverage, and mutation frequency were assessed as filters for specificity while maintaining the ability to detect true positive calls. Thresholds were established to ensure specificity is maintained at targeted MAF levels for reporting. Mutation frequency thresholds were established at $0 . 4 \%$ , $2 \%$ , and $5 \%$ for sequence mutations based on a categorization of Variants with Evidence of Clinical Significance, somatic hotspots, and non-hotspots positions.

Additional filtering of Variants with Potential Clinical Significance excludes reporting of insertions and deletions in homopolymer regions (5 bp or greater) below $12 \%$ MAF as well as sequence mutations with lower bound $9 5 \%$ Confidence Interval $< 5 \%$ MAF based on sequence coverage. Additional quality metrics, such as base quality and strand bias were also incorporated in assessments of confidence for pipeline filters. A cohort of normal FFPE tissue $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 3 6 )$ was used to provide empirical evidence that specificity was maintained using the pipeline thresholds and filters.

# F Performance Characteristics:

# 1. Analytical Performance- General:

The PGDx elio tissue complete is a targeted NGS panel with 505 genes. The targeted regions of interest in PGDx elio tissue complete are designed to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs) as well as small insertions and deletions (indels) $< 3 0 \mathrm { b p }$ in length in the coding exons of the targeted genes, as well as ERBB2 amplifications, ALK, RET, NTRK2, and NTRK3 translocations, MSI, and TMB. For SNVs and indels, A representative approach to validation of the targeted genes in the panel was submitted with data representing variant types for SNVs and indels, and at the gene level for amplification and translocations indicated with this assay. In addition, the assay was evaluated for performance regarding the panel wide quality metrics.

# a) Invalid Rates

Multiple factors can influence overall robustness and performance of complex molecular tests, including pre-analytical factors and overall sample quality. If key inprocess or automated data quality metrics are not met, PGDx elio tissue complete supports repeating samples through the workflow. Performance throughout verification and validation of the device was tracked and a summary of the rates for first pass (no repeat) and overall pass (allowing for a single repeat) are presented below. Data were aggregated for clinical cases from ${ > } 4 0$ tumor types. Resulting pass rates for all samples (clinical samples and cell lines) are presented in Table 5, while Table 6 shows invalid rate by tumor type across the workflow. The data shows that there the performance across tumor types is supportive of a pan tumor profiling.

# 2. Precision/Reproducibility:

# a) Interlaboratory Reproducibility

Interlaboratory reproducibility of the PGDx elio tissue complete assay was assessed across 3 different sites, using DNA extracted from 13 FFPE tissue specimens and 1 cell line. Together these 14 samples represented a range of SNVs, indels, ERBB2 amplifications, ALK, RET, and NTRK3 translocations, MSI, and TMB. Each of the

14 samples were tested in duplicate by 2 different operators on 12 sequencing runs across 3 non- consecutive days at each of the 3 independent laboratory sites using a single kit lot (36 total sequencing runs and 504 total replicates). Allele frequencies for the variants in the specimens spanned all ranges. Each replicate began with the workflow post-DNA extraction.

# b) Panel-wide Reproducibility

Reproducibility was assessed for each positive variant detected across all 36 replicates (Positive call rate) – The positive call rate was calculated based on the total number of mutations along with the two-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence interval.

Table 8 summarizes the positive call rates stratified by mutation type (SNV, insertions, and deletions) and mutant allele frequency (MAF). Overall call rate $8 6 . 2 \%$ across all samples and replicates (14493/16813, $8 5 . 7 \% 8 6 . 7 \% \mathrm { C l }$ I) with increased positive call rate at higher mutant allele frequency (MAFs). In terms of invalid rate, the first pass rate was $9 0 . 3 \%$ (455/504) and the overall pass rate of the study after repeat testing was $9 8 . 2 \%$ (495/504) allowing a maximum of 1 round of repeat testing.

The positive call rates for individual sequence mutations assessed in the Interlaboratory Reproducibility study, along with the MAF range, mean, SD, and CV are presented in Appendix D. A total of 337 SNVs and 137 indels (22 insertions, 115 deletions) are

provided. Variants are listed by specimen; each specimen is separated by a dark gray line. Discordant cases are denoted in light grey.

1 Positive call rate was calculated based on variants with majority call detected as positive. 2 Negative call rate was calculated based on variants detected at least once, but with majority or equal call as negative. For all other locations, the negative call rates are $100 \%$ . 3 Specimen 2 was selected for presence of ALK translocation and had no detected SNVs or indels.

# d) Analysis of Source of Variance

Average Positive Agreement (APA) and Average Negative Agreement (ANA) was assessed to analyze the imprecision caused by different sources of variance across all 3 sites. Data analysis is presented stratified by variant type and presented for 1) overall, 2) site to site, 3) operator to operator, 4) day to day, and 5) within-run concordance.

TMB was assessed using $\% C V$ of the TMB score across test sample replicates for samples with a reference TMB above LoB (7.2 Muts/Mb). The results are shown in (Table 10).

Independently ERBB2 amplification and ALK, NTRK2 and NTRK3, RET translocations were evaluated (one specimen each) and analyzed by ANA and APA. The overall APA for these variants was $9 7 . 7 \%$ and ANA was $9 9 . 9 \%$ . For BRCA1 deleterious variants, the APA was $1 1 . 8 \%$ because 3 replicates from a single case showed detection of a mutation not present in the other replicates. The MAF values for these 3 observations were $1 . 2 \%$ , $0 . 9 \%$ , and $0 . 8 \%$ , respectively (data not shown).

# e) Precision for MSI:

Precision of MSI was evaluated across 8 MSS and 6 MSI-H samples with a range of MSI scores. The mean MSI score, MSI range, SD and $\%$ CV for the score along with positive call rates are provided for results with 36 replicates obtained in the 3-site reproducibility study. The results demonstrate that precision of MSI values is supported by the PGDx elio tissue complete. Data is shown in Table 11.

# f) Precision for Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB):

Precision of TMB was evaluated across 11 samples (with TMB scores near the analytical borderline value of TMB LoB of 7.2 Muts/Mb) in the 3-site reproducibility site. The distribution of replicates by site, operator, and day is across site, operator, and day per samples and score are provided in Figure 5 (Figure 5 shows the distribution of replicates per site and operator for each of representative specimens by TMB score and test day). The data demonstrates high precision for TMB scores.

# g) Precision – cell lines:

Prior to performing the 3-site reproducibility study with clinical specimens, a study with DNA extracted from 6 blended cell line samples and a single colorectal FFPE sample that was MSI-H were evaluated. Together these samples represented a variety of DNA alterations, including over 600 unique alterations across a range of mutant allele fractions (MAFs). Each of the 7 samples was tested in duplicate by 2 different operators on 6 distinct sequencing runs at each of the 3 independent laboratory sites using a single kit lot. The positive call rate observed for the distinct variant types was consistent with the data observed with the clinical specimens (Table 12) though the cell line data had a larger number of variants with low MAFs due to a dilution effect. Cell lines were blended at low concentrations reducing the MAF of insertions below thresholds and left only 20 total insertions (and only 3 at $2 1 5 \%$ MAF) for assessment.

# h) Lot-to-lot Precision

Performance of PGDx elio tissue complete was assessed across 3 unique kit lots by determining concordance of variant calls in FFPE tissue samples. The 3 unique kit lots were utilized to process 5 test cases in triplicate for a total of 45 observations. All batches were sequenced on the same instrument. Table 13 lists the Average Positive Agreement (APA) and Average Negative Agreement (ANA) used to assess lot to lot performance. APA for all variants is $> 8 6 \%$ , and $\% C V$ for TMB analyses is $< 1 0 \%$ . The performance is consistent with that of the reproducibility study.

# 3. Analytical Sensitivity - Limit of Detection (LoD):

The recommended DNA input for PGDx elio tissue complete is $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g }$ of total DNA with a minimum $20 \%$ tumor purity. The LoD of the PGDx elio tissue complete assay is defined as the mutant allele fraction (MAF) at which $9 5 \%$ of replicates for a variant type are reliably detected. The LoD study was comprised of two steps: LoD establishment using cell lines and LoD confirmation with 10 FFPE clinical tumor samples from clinical cases across a diverse set of cancers (4 SNVs, 4 insertions and 4 deletions). Select specimens were used to evaluate specific mutations with evidence of clinical significance. Specimens were selected for allele frequencies near the claimed cut-offs. Details of the data are discussed and shown below.

# a) LoD - SNVs, Insertions, and Deletions: b)

Target levels for detection were first established in a dilution series from cell lines with up to 5 target MAF levels. The analytical sensitivity and LOD95 was then confirmed in clinical FFPE specimens. Data was aggregated across 2 reagent kit lots when possible, otherwise the lot with the higher MAF was used. Cell lines were used to establish the LoD MAF range for 451 SNVs and 31 indels across the panel. A total of 150 observations were generated (3 samples with 10 replicates at 5 dilution levels). Positive call status and MAF was evaluated for select variants identified in 10 FFPE clinical specimens diluted with normal DNA derived from FFPE tissue. Each specimen was processed with 2 kit lots of PGDx elio tissue complete across 10 replicates for a total of 200 observations (Table 14). The established analytical sensitivity ranges were confirmed at $\ge 9 5 \%$ call rate with FFPE clinical cases on a per variant level (Table 14) and using all somatic variants identified in FFPE clinical cases representing a range of MAFs for hotspot and non-hotspot positions (Table 15). A summary of the LoD mean mutant allele frequency and range as well as the positive call rate are displayed for each variant type by variant type for the entire panel across all replicates is shown in the Table 25 below. A range of $5 . 9 \mathrm { - } 1 2 . 6 \%$ MAF was observed using the lowest average MAF where the positive call rates wa $s \geq 9 5 \%$ . The observed sequencing depth (DP), allele depth (AD), mutation allele frequency (MAF) range and average MAF are included.

Additional evaluations of analytical sensitivity performance used dilution series of FFPE clinical specimens. The positive call rates, sequence coverage, and mutant allele fraction are provided for a total of 11 SNVs, 3 insertions, and 5 deletions from 5 clinical FFPE specimens with 5 replicates per dilution level. A range of $5 . 9 \mathrm { - } 1 2 . 6 \%$ MAF was observed using the lowest average MAF where the positive call rates was $\ge 9 5 \%$ . (Table 16 - Table 34).

An in-depth variant analysis of cell-line samples from LoD establishment studies were assessed to further demonstrate analytical sensitivity. The positive call rates, sequence coverage (DP), allele depth (AD), and mutant allele fraction (MAF) are provided for a total of 13 SNVs, 4 insertions, and 4 deletions from a cell-line based dilution series of 3 samples with 10 replicates at 5 dilution levels (Table 35-Table 55).

# c) LoD - MSI, Translocations, and Amplifications (Tumor Purity)

Analytical sensitivity of ERBB2, ALK, RET, NTRK3, and MSI was confirmed by testing 7 clinical FFPE cases (NSCLC, breast and CRC) diluted with normal FFPE DNA to achieve targeted detection levels (variants at low tumor purity). Each unique case was confirmed at $\ge 9 5 \%$ call rate at 1 tumor purity level, with 10 replicates per kit lot, across 2 unique lots for translocations and amplifications. For MSI-H, 3 FFPE clinical specimen cases were confirmed at 1 tumor purity level with 10 replicates each.

1 The enrolled ALK case was evaluated with only 17 total replicates due to insufficient DNA quantity.

# i. ALK:

The ALK Limit of Detection Clinical Confirmation study was examined to determine the number of fusion reads observed by PGDx elio tissue complete in these samples. Call rates of $100 \%$ across 2 lots were observed in dilutions with $5 . 6 \%$ tumor content with decreasing call rates at lower levels, $3 . 2 \%$ and $1 \%$ (Table 57)

# ii. Microsatellite Instability (MSI):

Three (3) additional, independent FFPE cases were used to confirm the LoD with respect to tumor purity for MSI, two of these cases were CRC and one was endometrial cancer. These 3 independent FFPE cases were used in the confirmation of LoD with 10 replicates per kit lot across 2 lots for a total of 60 observations (20 per sample). (Figure 6 shows three boxplots; the boxplots represent different tumor proportions relative to a red line that is a presumptive cut off for MSI-H. The boxplots show the distribution of replicate results.) The FFPE clinical case used for the establishment of LoD was CRC.

Figure 6. Combined MSI score across three LOD confirmation cases with 20 replicates each. TP $=$ tumor purity.

These data were used to confirm a tumor purity LoD for MSI of $1 8 \%$ , which is above the recommended tumor purity input for PGDx elio tissue complete. As shown in the graphs above, the precision of MSI calling near the LoD of the assay is robust across the range of MSI scores. The data demonstrated that the MSI-H result was maintained at approximately $20 \%$ tumor purity.

# d) LoD – Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) and DNA input

The minimum tumor purity requirement for input into PGDx elio tissue complete is $20 \%$ . The minimum tumor purity required for robust reporting of TMB scores by PGDx elio tissue complete was confirmed using 8 clinical FFPE cases. Samples 1-5 were serially diluted across 3 levels with 5 replicates per level and 1 level with 3 replicates (18 total), sample 6 was serially diluted across 5 levels at 10 replicates per level (50 total), and samples 7-8 were serially diluted across 5 levels with 5 replicates per level (25 total with $10 \%$ tumor purity). The total number of replicates per sample and the $\% C V$ of all replicates with $\ge 1 5 \%$ tumor purity are shown below in Table 58. Together these data show PGDx elio tissue complete has consistent TMB performance across tumor purities at or above $1 5 \%$ . The claim for TMB score is $20 \%$ tumor purity (Figure 7; the figure shows 8 lines representative of 8 samples across multiple tumor purities and the expected consistency in scores as a function of tumor purity).

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (controls, calibrators, or methods)

# a) Traceability:

The PGDx elio tissue complete assay is not traceable to any known standard.   
Controls and quality metrics are described in the device description section.

# b) Stability/Shelf life:

Product expiration dating is based on testing at multiple time points with specimens representative of variant types with 3 lots of the PGDx elio tissue complete assay reagent kit. The current shelf life for the PGDx elio tissue complete assay reagent kit is 6 months when stored according to the temperatures indicated on the label.

PGDx elio tissue complete can be used commercially for up to 4 freeze/thaw cycles.

# c) Transport Conditions:

PGDx elio tissue complete kits are shipped using an insulated container with dry ice (all $- 8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and ${ } - 2 0 { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ reagents) and a Controlled Room Temperature container (with predetermined configuration of gel (cold and/or frozen) packs, meant for 4 $^ \circ \mathrm { C }$ and room temperature reagents) to maintain the product for up to 72 hours when stored at ambient   
temperature.

# d) Expected values (controls, calibrators or methods)

An external control that is provided in the PGDx elio tissue complete assay reagent kit consists of cell line derived-DNA with multiple verified sequence mutations. The external control is processed from library preparation through sequencing to serve as an end to end control to demonstrate assay performance. The external control is checked for quality during library preparation and after sequencing. Failure of the external control to meet the pre-defined quality metrics will result in all test samples on the run being reported as “No result.” In addition, several quality metrics are established as thresholds for reporting results to provide for high confidence data.

# 6. Analytical Specificity:

# a) Cut-off/False positive rate (Limit of Blank in DNA NGS)

Non-cancerous FFPE tissues and reference materials were evaluated for analytical specificity to assessed risk of false positives in normal tissues when detecting SNVs, indels, translocations, amplifications, MSI and TMB using PGDx elio tissue complete.

i. Reference standards: Two reference standards from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), NA24531 and NA24385 were evaluated by PGDx elio tissue complete for variants reported. Specificity was observed at $100 \%$ with no unverified mutations reported across 5 replicates for each standard. Four (4) sequence mutations previously characterized in the standards were also reported by PGDx elio tissue complete and determined to be germline mutations that are of rare prevalence in the general population.

ii. FFPE Clinical Specimens – 100ng input: Analytical specificity of SNVs, indels, RET, ALK, NTRK translocations, ERBB2 amplifications, MSI and

TMB was further assessed with non-cancerous FFPE tissues. Unique test cases from 34 normal FFPE samples were processed with the recommended $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g }$ DNA input across 2 different lots of the PGDx elio tissue complete assay kit. For Variants with Evidence of Clinical Significance, the rate of false positives is $< 0 . 1 \%$ while the false positive rate for hotspot SNVs is $<$ $3 . 2 \%$ b $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n } = 2 / 6 3 )$ ). For MSI-H (qualitative call), the false positive rate was 0 (n $= 2 6 )$ . For TMB, the false positive rate (defined as scores $> 7 . 3$ Muts/Mb was $4 . 8 \%$ .

iii. FFPE Clinical Specimens – 50ng input: In addition to the assessment at the recommended DNA input of $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g } }$ , test cases from normal FFPE tissue types were prepared to assess specificity of the assay at $5 0 \mathrm { n g }$ DNA input. For Variants with Evidence of Clinical Significance, the rate of false positives is $< 0 . 1 \%$ while the false positive rate for hotspot SNVs is $< 3 . 8 \%$ $\mathrm { ( n { = } 1 / 2 6 }$ ). For MSI-H (qualitative call), the false positive rate is $< 1 . 6 \%$ . For TMB, the false positive rate (defined as scores $> 7 . 2$ Muts/Mb was $1 1 . 5 \%$ (3/26).

# b) Index Cross-Contamination

To demonstrate the ability of PGDx elio tissue complete in detection of contaminating samples, this study assessed whether samples artificially mixed in silico to a known degree were detected as contaminated. Five FFPE clinical samples of each African, East Asian, and European genetic ancestry (15 FFPE samples total) that had been previously sequenced and shown not to be contaminated were used. In silico, the data from these 5 samples from each ancestry group were mixed with all others of the same ancestry and 1 sample from both other ancestries. According to the results, this device will not detect all instances of contamination when both sample and contaminant are from individuals of Asian ancestry. A limitation in the package insert was established to caution that care should be taken to avoid crosscontamination of such samples.

# c) Necrotic Tissue

The impact of necrosis on the performance of PGDx elio tissue complete was evaluated by assessing the first pass and overall pass rates (after one repeat test) of samples processed in the accuracy study (see Clinical Performance section below). Of 521 samples enrolled for accuracy, 448 were evaluated for necrosis over a range of $0 - 7 5 \%$ . The data indicated there is no correlation between necrosis and pass/fail rate.

# d) Interfering Substances

The impact of interfering substances on the performance of the PGDx elio tissue complete assay was assessed by processing DNA from FPPE samples tested in the presence of each interfering substance at varying amounts (Table 59). The samples were evaluated for concordance of variant calls when compared to samples processed without the interfering substances. Replicates for 5 test cases were analyzed for 8 experimental and 2 baseline conditions. Performance was evaluated across 5 samples $\textrm { X } 1 0$ conditions $\mathrm { ~ X ~ l 5 ~ }$ replicates using multiple operators and

instruments. Samples were selected to be near the LoD. Analysis of all variant types tested (SNVs, indels, translocations, amplifications and MSI) showed no effect of exogenous interferent for all conditions: PPA $( \geq 9 7 . 2 \% )$ and NPA $( \geq 9 9 . 9 \% )$ (Table 60). The TMB mean absolute percent error (MAPE) ranged from $0 \%$ to $6 . 0 \%$ across conditions (Table 61). The results show minimal risk to assay performance from interfering substances.

# e) Sample Carryover and Cross-Contamination:

Cross-contamination (contamination from one sample to another within the same batch) and sample carryover (contamination from a previous sequencing run when using the same instrument) were assessed by evaluating false positive and false negative variant calls in 29 FFPE samples. Seven (7) of the 29 cases had known positive variants, the remaining samples were known negative samples. All FFPE samples were assessed across 2 batches to test for contamination within and between runs. In batch 1, a checkerboard pattern within a 96-well plate was created by alternating the samples with representative positive variants and known negative samples. Batch 2 contained known negative samples and was pooled and sequenced directly after completion of batch 1 sequencing, following standard instrument cleaning procedures. No positive variant results were observed in known negative samples tested. Sample carryover and cross-contamination were not observed in any of the conditions evaluated.

# 7. Robustness Studies

# a) Sample Stability:

DNA stability was assessed for extracted DNA stored at $\leq - 2 0 { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ prior to processing through PGDx elio tissue complete. A total of 45 unique clinical samples from 11 different tissue types were tested. The duration of DNA storage at the time of the evaluation in this study ranged from 97 to 377 days, with a median of 330 days ${ \sim } 1 0 . 6$ months) and a mean of 295 days ( ${ \sim } 9 . 5$ months).

Samples were sequenced at the time of initial extraction to determine a reference status of the variants, which was labeled as T0. PGDx elio tissue complete demonstrated robust analytical performance and concordant results for all variants assessed (MSI, amplifications, translocations, and sequence mutations) using DNA specimens stored for various times. Performance was maintained across all of the DNA storage times with $\mathrm { P P A } \ge 9 3 . 2 \%$ and $\mathrm { N P A } > 9 9 . 9 \%$ (Table 62).

# b) DNA Extraction

PGDx elio tissue complete may be used with an appropriate commercially available DNA extraction method. Three DNA extraction methods were evaluated. Three commonly used, commercially available DNA extraction kits included a column-based extraction method and a bead-based extraction method. DNA extraction method concordance was evaluated in 2 studies, including 1 cell line

and 10 FFPE solid tumor tissue samples selected to contain all variant types assessed by PGDx elio tissue complete, including borderline variants near the LoD. Each of the samples were extracted in duplicate by 2 operators for each of the 3 DNA extraction kits. The 48 DNA samples were processed with PGDx elio tissue complete in duplicate resulting in 96 total sequencing reactions (4 samples x 2 extractions $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ operators x 3 extraction methods $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ assay replicates). Method 2 (bead-based) and Method 3 (automated) were compared to the reference Method 1 (column-based). The overall pass rate for FFPE samples was $9 3 . 1 \%$ (67/72). PGDx elio tissue complete yielded concordant analytical performance for variant calls across the DNA extraction methods positive percent agreement (PPA) was $5 9 7 \%$ negative percent agreement (NPA) was ${ > } 9 9 . 9 \%$ between methods. The TMB CV for all assessed cases was $< 1 2 . 5 \%$ . These data demonstrate that an appropriate commercially available FFPE DNA extraction method may be used to extract DNA for the PGDx elio tissue complete assay.

# c) DNA Input

The optimal and recommended amount of input DNA for the assay is $1 0 0 { \mathrm { n g } }$ . Minimum $( 5 0 \mathrm { n g } )$ and recommended $( 1 0 0 \mathrm { n g } )$ DNA input requirements were established by measuring assay performance with different inputs from FFPE tumor tissues $( 2 5 - 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g } )$ . To evaluate assay performance across a range of DNA inputs, 4 unique FFPE samples with known variants were prepared in triplicate at 10, 25, 50, 100 and $2 0 0 \mathrm { n g } \mathrm { D N A }$ input levels. The 4 FFPE cases assessed contained representative SNVs, indels, amplifications, translocations, MSI and TMB. The first pass acceptability rate for PGDx elio tissue complete was $100 \%$ across all DNA inputs for all DNA inputs except 10ng DNA which was $7 5 \%$ (9/12). After repeat testing, all 12 specimens yielded results.

The variant calls for these samples were compared to the respective reference DNA input of $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g }$ for each case to assess concordance. Table 63 describes PPA and NPA for each input level where aggregated variants were analyzed, including SNVs, indels, amplifications, translocations, and MSI. For TMB, the mean absolute percent error rate at each DNA input level was compared to $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g }$ (Table 64). These data indicate the assay is robust around the recommended $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g }$ DNA input.

# 8. Comparison Studies:

# a) Method Comparison (Accuracy)

The analytical accuracy of PGDx elio tissue complete as a tumor profiling device was evaluated using 582 clinical FFPE samples, obtained from patients with a variety of tumor types $\mathrm { ( n } { = } 3 5 \mathrm { ) }$ ). Due to the rarity of specific genetic variants in solid tumor FFPE samples, most samples selected for this study were pre-screened, resulting in an enrichment of certain variants relative to real-world clinical prevalence. Data was aggregated at the variant level for SNVs and indels, gene level for amplifications and translocations, and case level for MSI and TMB. Out of 521 FFPE tumor specimens, 455 had both predicate and PGDx elio tissue complete results, over 35 tumor types, with 763 unique true positive variants observed in 578 exons over 272 genes. Among those variants, there were 620 SNVs, 44 insertions and 99 deletions.

Accuracy is summarized for the entire cohort of 582 samples for each of the assessed variants types (SNVs, indels, MSI, TMB, and structural variants). The Orthogonal

Method consisted of validated NGS and PCR methods. For the translocations, amplification, and sequence mutation results, PPV and NPV were first calculated for each variant for which PGDx elio results were known before the orthogonal results. Additionally, PPA/NPA were calculated by adjusting for the proportion of variant positive samples by test device. (Table 65)

1 MSI accuracy was assessed in 18 tumor types: ampulla (1), bladder (7), breast (21), colorectal (66), endometrial (18), esophagus (1), fallopian tube (1), gall bladder (1), gastric (40), lung (39), kidney (3), omentum (1), ovarian (2), prostate (4), sarcoma (3), skin (8), thyroid (2), and cancer of unknown primary (5).

2 An EGFR T790M mutation reported by PGDx elio tissue complete was not confirmed by PCR. A third orthogonal method (ddPCR) confirmed the presence of this EGFR T790M mutation at $2 . 1 \%$ MAF.

4 Borderlines are defined by a HER2/CEP17 ratio between 1.5 and 2.5 by FISH.

5 No read data supporting RET translocations was found in the raw data for the discrepant cases. In addition to the clinical samples processed to assess RET translocations, 3 RET translocation-positive cell lines were also tested with PGDx elio tissue complete. All 3 cell lines were positive for a fusion either by a validated assay performed by the cell line provider, or via literature. PGDx elio tissue complete detected all 3 fusions in these cell lines.

# i. Accuracy – SNVs

The PGDx elio tissue complete accuracy study included 923 unique SNVs from 307 genes with 84 unique insertions from 60 genes with 159 unique deletions from 101 genes. Performance was stratified by mutation type and gene for positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) with $9 5 \%$ confidence interval (CI). Results are shown fin tables below. Orthogonal data was derived from 2 competitor NGS panels from which the complete sequencing ROI was not available. Additionally, differences in sensitivity were not accounted for in this data set. Differences not due to low allelic fraction were limited to variants of unknown significance and are expected based on differences in filtering employed by PGDx elio tissue complete and comparator methods. Therefore, agreement may be underrepresented.

Following tables show the results of accuracy study by gene: the percent positive agreement for SNVs by gene, and the percent positive agreement for insertions and deletions by gene. Since the orthogonal data was tested prior to knowing the PGDx elio tissue complete results, the PPA could be calculated. The complete listing of Data in in Appendix E (1-3).

# ii. Accuracy –Concordance to FISH for ERBB2 amplification:

In total 147 different tumor tissues representing 20 different tumors types of which 70 breast and 29 gastric cancer cases) were analyzed for concordance between FISH status and PGDx elio tissue complete ERBB2 status. The ability of the assay to detect ERBB2 amplifications was assessed in 2 studies: the first study contained the expected prevalence of FISH borderline samples and the second study enriched the population for ERBB2 borderline cases. The PPA and NPA values for ERBB2 amplification reflect the totals across both studies and is an over representation of borderline cases. The data shows high concordance in the non-borderline cases (excluding all cases of FISH ratio 1.5-2.5), with PPA of $8 7 \%$ , and NPA, PPV and NPV at or above $9 2 \%$ (Table 66).

The PGDx elio tissue complete reported the majority of borderline positive fish tests as negative. The PGDx elio tissue complete threshold for reporting an ERBB2 positive result is 2.5-fold change. Consequently, the data presented in this table show that the 2.0 to 2.5 positive borderline range had reduced agreement. This 2.5-fold threshold was established during feasibility to ensure $100 \%$ specificity (no false positives). Therefore, cases that fall into the FISH positive borderline range with FISH ratios of 2.0-2.5 are generally not reported by the PGDx elio tissue complete assay due to the assay’s 2.5-fold change threshold for reporting an amplified ERBB2 status. Specifics of the borderline performance are shown in Table 66. The estimate of frequency of ERBB2 amplification with an ERBB2/Chromosome 17 FISH ratio of 2-2.5 is estimated to be $2 . 2 \%$ .

# iii. Accuracy – Concordance to FISH for RET:

RET translocations were compared to a commercial RET Break Apart FISH probe Kit. Following table presents results for RET translocation concordance without regard to sample selection from either orthogonal method or test device for RET translocations. The calculations are not adjusted for the specimens that were first determined to be positive by the FISH assay. Seven (7) of the specimens deemed positive by the PGDx were $100 \%$ positive with the orthogonal comparator. For the twenty (20) specimens for which the orthogonal information was known for these samples prior to running them through the PGDx elio tissue complete assay, the PGDx had four false negatives (Table 68).

# iv. Accuracy – Concordance to FISH for ALK Translocation:

The ability of the PGDx elio tissue complete assay to detect ALK was evaluated using 71 specimens (14 FISH positive and 57 FISH negative). The results demonstrated high concordance to FISH (Tables 60 and 70).

ALK borderline performance in FFPE specimens as demonstrated from Limit of Detection:

The lowest $\%$ nuclei scored specimen was $50 \%$ and lacked specimens at the borderline equivocal zone $( 1 5 \% )$ . ALK FISH borderline samples at the cut-off of $1 5 \%$ cells positive are rare, with expected prevalence of $1 \%$ or less. Since PGDx was unable to obtain clinical FFPE samples in the ALK FISH equivocal zone, consideration was given for performance with ALK borderline using two two sets of data: assessment of performance with low tumor proportions (refer to data in Analytical sensitivity section) and a supplemental in silico study was performed that assessed analytical accuracy for ALK at decreased positive FISH signal. This study used the sequencing data from ALK positive clinical FFPE specimens that were diluted bioinformatically in order to assess the

expected positive call rate at varying FISH levels. ALK translocations were assessed in silico due to limited availability of clinical cases close to the ALK FISH equivocal zone $10 \% { - } 5 0 \%$ rearrangement positive nuclei). A total of 410 observations were generated for ALK by downsampling 10 clinical samples from analytical accuracy to 4 tumor purity dilution levels with 10 replicates per level, to mimic samples in the FISH equivocal zone. For example, if the undiluted sample had a FISH score of $50 \%$ from analytical accuracy, the sample was diluted with wild type reads by a factor of 0.8 to get to a $40 \%$ positive nuclei FISH score. These data demonstrate an LoD of $30 \%$ positive nuclei by FISH, when identifying the lowest level with a $2 9 5 \%$ positive call rate (Table 71). The FISH level, average positive call rate, in addition to the range of call rates across all cases per level, and the range of fusion reads across all replicates per level is provided Table 91 below. These data demonstrate an $8 8 \%$ positive call rate at $20 \%$ positive nuclei by FISH

A study was conducted to assess accuracy for 75 selected hotspots within 20 genes. The selected hotspot variants included mutations that were coding hotspot mutations (missense or frameshift). A total of 112 specimens were tested, and the accuracy of PGDx elio tissue complete results at all 75 positions was compared to results obtained with two orthogonal methods (42 samples using 1 method, and 70 using a second method). Within the 112 specimens, there were 112 mutations across samples and 8,283 wild-type calls. Overall variant-level concordance (PPA and NPA) was $9 6 . 4 \%$ and $9 9 . 9 \%$ respectively with two-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals of $( 9 1 . 1 \%$ , $9 9 . 0 \%$ ) for mutations (PPA), and $( 9 9 . 9 \%$ , $9 9 . 9 \%$ for wild-type locations (NPA).

# vi. TMB Accuracy

The PGDx elio tissue complete assay reports a TMB score comprised of sequence mutations detected across the entire coding region of interest per sample. The ability of PGDx elio tissue complete to accurately identify TMB in multiple solid tissue FFPE tumor types was assessed by comparing to matched tumor-normal whole exome sequencing results. Across 8 tumor types (non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)), melanoma, renal, bladder, endometrial, triple negative breast, head and neck, lung-NOS (not otherwise specified), 118 cases were enrolled covering a dynamic range of 1.5-118.5 Muts/Mb. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship between the 2 assays. Assessment of all 118 cases resulted in a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.903. The results in Figure 8 show concordance between PGDx elio tissue complete TMB scores and tumor-normal whole exome sequencing.

Figure 8. PGDx elio tissue complete TMB score vs. Matched Tumor-Normal Exome Sequencing.

Below is the calculated PPA for sequence mutations, broken down by insertions vs. deletions as well as by indel length. Differences in calls were detected at a higher proportion amongst deletions, however, the overall proportion of deletions to all mutations in the mutation load is relatively minor compared to the contribution of the SNVs in the mutation load.

# vii. Accuracy – MSI

The accuracy of PGDX elio tissue test calling of MSI status in tumor tissue was evaluated in a method comparison study against a validated PCR based MSI test. This study evaluated 115 cases of which 66 cases were of colorectal cancer (CRC), 18 of endometrial cancer (EC) and 21 non-CRC/EC cases. An additional $1 6 8 \ \mathrm { n o n – C R C / n o n – }$ EC cases were tested in a supplemental study to ascertain accuracy of MSI calls in range of tumor types. All samples were randomized, and study participants blinded to MSI status from orthogonal test results for these cases. Of the 283 samples tested 54 samples failed to produce results with the PGDx elio Tissue test of which 10 also failed to produce a result with the PCR test. Of specimens that produced a result with both PGDx elio Tissue and MIS PCR test, the PPA is $9 8 . 8 \%$ (79/80) with $9 5 \%$ CI $9 3 . 3 \% 9 9 . 8 \%$ for MSI-H status and NPA $9 9 . 3 \%$ (142/143) with $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I } 9 6 . 1 \% 9 9 . 9 \%$ for MSS status. When including specimens with failed and indeterminate test results the PPA is $9 4 . 0 \%$ (79/84) with $9 5 \%$ CI $8 6 . 8 \% 9 7 . 4 \%$ for MSI-H status and NPA is $7 7 . 6 \%$ (142/183) with $9 5 \%$ CI $7 1 . 0 \% 8 3 . 0 \%$ for MSS status.

viii. Accuracy - Other: The effect of GC content and exon length were explored on coverage for the assay. It was determined that ff the 7026 total exons in PGDx elio tissue complete, there are 59 challenging exons demonstrating $\leq 1 0 0 \mathbf { x }$ coverage in $30 \%$ of samples or greater from Analytical Accuracy. The exons that tend to be shorter in length such that short exons with low GC content are the most vulnerable to reduced coverage. Overall the the Pass rate for specimens was assessed for the PGDx elio tissue complete and determined to be similar to the pass rate observed with real world evidence indicating that the accuracy of the PGDx elio tissue complete is representative performance across tumor types with coverage that exceeded the quality metrics established for the assay.

N. Instrument Name: Illumina NextSeq $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 550Dx (qualified by PGDx)

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device?

Yes ___ _X____ or No

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?

Yes or No _ _X

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes ___ _X____ or No

5. Calibration & Quality Controls:

PGDx uses DiversiPhi to qualify the instrument and monitor instrument performance. The instrument and assay employ both in-process QC Checks and physical controls. See description in traceability section for calibrator value assignments.

PGDx elio tissue complete requires $90 \%$ of exons with sequence coverage ${ \displaystyle \mathrm { > } 1 0 0 \mathbf { x } }$ for reporting of sequence alterations in a sample, otherwise the sample is marked failed. The device uses automated QC metrics that align to the following categories:

1) “Batch-level” $=$ metrics quantified per sequencing run; failing batch-level metrics generates “No result” reports samples failing these criteria. If the external control fails these criteria, “No result” is reported for the entire batch of samples.

2) “Sample-level” $=$ metrics quantified per sample; generates “No result” report for that sample failing QC.

3) “Analyte-level” $=$ metrics quantified on an analyte (variant) call-level, whereby multiple different passing statuses can exist within the same sample. All samples receive reports for all variants passing analyte-level QC.

When a report is generated, all metrics are assessed dynamically on a per-sample basis.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

Not applicable

# Q. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as applicable

# R. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.

# S. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:

Instrument concordance: A study was performed to demonstrate agreement between NExtSeq $5 5 0 \mathrm { D x }$ instruments and NextSeq 550 Dx reagents and instruments and reagents qualified by PGDx. PPA and NPA were assessed for each variant out put (SNVs, indels, translocations, amplifications, MSI and TMB). The study demonstrated no discordance attributable to instrument or reagent.

diversiPhi validation: Studies were conducted to validate the analytical performance of the PGDx elio tissue complete using PGDx elio diversiPhi to fill partial sequencing run batches. Testing was conducted by 1 operator on a total of 4 different NextSeq instruments, using 1 lot of PGDx elio tissue complete kit and 1 lot of PGDx elio diversiPhi. Two unique blends were assessed across 3 prospective batches containing diversiPhi to reprent different lane ratios sequenced: $6 . 2 5 \%$ (14 samples $+ \nobreakspace 1 \nobreakspace$ external control), $50 \%$ (7 samples plus one external control) and $8 7 . 5 \%$ (1 sample $^ +$ external control). These runs were then compared back to the reference data whichincluded $0 . 0 \%$ diversiPhi (15 samples $^ { + 1 }$ EC). The data demonstrated that diversiPhi could be used to fill partial sequencing batches based on observation that the overall concordance consistent with the analytical validation data.

Database: As a distributed kit, the software includes database information regarding the variants and their assignment to either Variants with Evidence of Clinical Significance or Variants with Potential Clinical Significance. A description of the assignment and curation process was provided. Report Generation in PGDx Elio Tissue Complete: The PGDx elio tissue complete software generates reports for each sequencing run and sample processed. The software does not include annotation regarding the individual variants. The report includes tumor type, allele frequency, and functional information.

There are three reported outputs, 1) Case Report, 2) Complete Case Record (CCR), and 3) Complete Run Record (CRR).

The Case Report is the primary report of identified alterations for a sample. The Case Report divides variants into 2 sections: ‘Variants with Evidence of Clinical Significance’ on page 1 only and ‘Variants with Potential Clinical Significance’ on subsequent pages. The variants listed in the section ‘Variants with Evidence of Clinical Significance’ are determined based on the selected tumor type. Only variants clinically associated with the selected tumor type will appear on page 1 of the Case Report in the ‘Variants with Evidence of Clinical Significance’ section. Any remaining variants will appear in the ‘Variants with Potential Clinical Significance’ section starting on the second page. A qualified healthcare professional selects the appropriate tumor type to ensure the corresponding variants of clinical significance appear on page 1. Any variants clinically associated with tumor types other than the one selected will be reported in the section labeled 'Variants with Potential Clinical Significance' and will appear on page 2 and subsequent pages.

# VIII. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as applicable, and the special controls for this device type.

# IX. Patient Perspectives

This submission did not include specific information on patient perspectives for this device.

# X. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this 510(k) notification supports the Indications For Use for elioTissue Complete and demonstrates that the elio Tissue Complete assay is as safe and effective as the predicate device and therefore supports a substantial equivalence conclusion.
