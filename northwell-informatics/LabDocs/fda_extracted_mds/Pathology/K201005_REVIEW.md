II. Submission/Device Overview:

A. Purpose for Submission: New device   
B. Type of Test: Not applicable – software-only device

III. Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A. Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B. Indication(s) for Use:

For In Vitro Diagnostic Use

FullFocus™ is a software only device intended for viewing and management of digital images of scanned surgical pathology slides prepared from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. It is an aid to the pathologist to review, interpret, and manage digital images of pathology slides for primary diagnosis. FullFocus is not intended for use with frozen sections, cytology, or non-FFPE hematopathology specimens.

It is the responsibility of a qualified pathologist to employ appropriate procedures and safeguards to assure the quality of the images obtained and, where necessary, use conventional light microscopy review when making a diagnostic decision. FullFocus is intended for use with Philips Ultra Fast Scanner and monitor displays validated with verified test methods to meet required performance characteristics.

C. Special Conditions for Use Statement(s): Rx - For Prescription Use Only

IV. Device/System Characteristics:

# A. Device Description:

FullFocus (version 1.2.1) is a web-based software-only device for viewing and manipulating digital pathology images of glass slides obtained from the Philips IntelliSite Pathology Solution (PIPS) Ultra Fast Scanner (UFS) on the monitor displays that are validated with verified test methods to meet required performance characteristics. FullFocus renders the uploaded slide images and is an aid to the pathologist to review, interpret and manage digital images of pathology slides for primary diagnosis.

The subject device is operated as follows:

1. The image acquisition is performed using the predicate device, PIPS UFS. The operator performs quality control of the digital slides per the instructions of PIPS UFS and lab specifications to determine if re-scans are necessary.   
2. Once slide image is acquired using PIPS UFS, according to its Instructions for Use, and becomes available in scanner database file systems, a separate medical image communications software (not part of the device) will automatically initiate uploading the slide image and corresponding metadata to persistent cloud storage. Integrity checks are being performed at upload time when data is copied to storage.

3. The reading pathologist uses the subject device to select a case (patient), view the images and is able to perform the following actions, as needed:

a. Zoom and pan the image b. Measure distances and areas in the image c. Annotate images

4. After viewing all images belonging to a particular case (patient), the pathologist will make a diagnosis.

1. Instrument Name: FullFocusTM

2. Specimen Identification:

The FullFocus uses digital pathology images obtained from the Philips IntelliSite Pathology Solution (PIPS) Ultra Fast Scanner (UFS) of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained glass slides. The reading pathologist selects a case (patient) from a worklist external to the subject device whereby the subject device fetches the associated images from the external image storage. The scanned images are identified based on the previously assigned specimen identifier.

# 3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Specimen sampling and handling are performed upstream and independent of the use of the subject device. Specimen sampling includes biopsy or resection specimens which are processed using histology techniques. The FFPE tissue section is H&E stained. Digital images are then obtained from these glass slides using the PIPS UFS.

4. Calibration: Not applicable

5. Quality Control:

The subject device receives whole-slide images from the Paige (image) storage. All WSI files are quality-controlled images acquired from the scanner according the scanner’s instructions for use. The subject device specific quality control measures are as follows:

View pathology images - Every pathologist should perform this test on review workstation before reading pathology images using the subject device to ensure that all scanned slide images have been imported and for every case, view the thumbnails in the pathology image window to verify that each slide that should be in the case is present (manually verifying tissue block and staining information from LIS).

Additional details of the quality control procedures are provided in the device Instructions for Use.

# B. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:

Technical performance testing for FullFocus device was performed. The new device was compared to the image management software component of the predicate device. The following testing was performed:

a. Pixel-wise comparison with the predicate device including zooming operations across multiple tiles and vertical/horizontal stitching seams The equivalence between the subject and predicate image review manipulation software {IRMS, as defined in the FDA guidance titled “Guidance for Industry “Technical Performance Assessment of Digital Pathology Whole Slide Imaging Devices", dated April 20, 2016 [TPA guidance, $\mathrm { I V } ( \mathrm { A } ) ( 9 ) ] \}$ was evaluated by bench testing data based on pixel-level comparison. The subject IRMS was tested as operating with the intended components, including the scanner and monitor display to evaluate the pixel-wise differences. WSI files from 22 FFPE tissue glass slides from different anatomic locations that were H&E stained were used as the test input. For each region of interest (ROI), the differences between the views generated by the subject and predicate IRMS were evaluated with the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) color difference metric CIEDE2000 $( \Delta \mathrm { E } )$ for each corresponding pixel pair. The two views generated by the subject and predicate IRMS were registered and cropped to find the maximum common areas. The test cases of ROIs included relevant biological features at magnification levels $2 0 \mathrm { x }$ and $4 0 \mathrm { x }$ . Horizontal/vertical stitching seams between the tiles were included in the ROIs when possible. The color differences of all pixel pairs within each ROI were reported. The image data of all ROIs were also provided for verification.

The test results demonstrated that the median $\Delta \mathrm { E }$ values across all ROIs range from 0.80 $\Delta \mathrm { E }$ to $3 . 8 5 \ \Delta \mathrm { E }$ with a median of $1 . 7 2 \ : \Delta \mathrm { E }$ and mean of $1 . 8 5 \ : \Delta \mathrm { E }$ (standard deviation: 0.67 $\Delta \mathrm { E }$ ). The mean $\Delta \mathrm { E }$ values across all ROIs range from $0 . 8 9 \Delta \mathrm { E }$ to $4 . 5 8 \ : \Delta \mathrm { E }$ with a median of $2 . 1 3 \ \Delta \mathrm { E }$ and mean of $2 . 2 4 ~ \Delta \mathrm { E }$ (standard deviation: $0 . 8 1 \ \Delta \mathrm { E }$ ). The median $\Delta \mathrm { E }$ by browser and magnification was also reported and comparable to overall results.

The subject device has been found to visually adequately reproduce digital pathology images to human readers with respect to its intended use.

b. Turnaround Time for the image to be fully loaded while opening a slide from a medical device data system (MDDS) and for panning/zooming

The turnaround times for opening an image and panning have been measured in the subject device. The subject device has been found to have an acceptable turnaround time with respect to its intended use for opening the first image, and panning and zooming within the image.

# c. Measurements – area and distance

Measurement accuracy has been verified using a test image containing objects of known sizes. The following set of tests were used to validate the measurement accuracy of the subject device.

Measurements verified using calibration slide with known distances: An image of a calibration slide with known distances was used to verify the measurement accuracy of the subject device. Test results showed that the subject device performed accurate measurements with respect to its intended use.

# d. Human Factors Testing

Human factors study designed around critical user tasks and use scenarios performed by representative users were conducted. A systematic evaluation of task-based usability including critical tasks required for operation of the device were evaluated at multiple sites using multiple users. All tasks associated with reviewing and reporting results for cases including confirmation that all slides belonging to specific cases are reviewed before reporting results, were included in the study. Overall, the results of the human factors testing were acceptable.
