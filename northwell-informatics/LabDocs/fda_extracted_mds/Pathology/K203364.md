Re: K203364 Trade/Device Name: MDPC-8127 Regulation Number: 21 CFR 864.3700 Regulation Name: Whole Slide Imaging System Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: PZZ Dated: February 12, 2021 Received: February 22, 2021

Dear Lieven De Wandel:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part

801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or post-marketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice (https://www.fda.gov/medical  
devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance) and CDRH Learn   
(https://www.fda.gov/training-and-continuing-education/cdrh-learn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic.

# Device description

The Barco MDPC-8127 is a medical, color-calibrated display, specifically intended for review and interpretation of surgical pathology slides from IVD-labeled whole-slide imaging scanners and digital pathology image viewing software that have been validated for use with the display.

The use of the MDPC-8127 display with scanners and viewing software is determined by using verified test methods to establish the display’s capability to meet or exceed the performance specifications and the intended color space specified by the IVD-labeled whole-slide imaging scanners and digital pathology image viewing software.

The display uses built-in techniques and technology to ensure constant accuracy over time.

The MDPC-8127 consists of an 8 mega-pixel, 27-inch color LCD-panel with internal electronics platform. It is calibrated to defined color spaces for whole-slide imaging and is compatible with digital pathology viewing software that utilizes defined color spaces to ensure images are displayed in intended colors.

The display is available with the following software accessories:

# Intended Use

The Barco MDPC-8127 device is intended for in vitro diagnostic use to display digital images of histopathology slides acquired from IVD-labeled whole-slide imaging scanners and viewed using IVD-labeled digital pathology image viewing software that have been validated for use with this device. It is an aid to the pathologist to review and interpret digital images of histopathology slides for primary diagnosis. It is the responsibility of the pathologist to employ appropriate procedures and safeguards to assure the validity of the interpretation of images using the MDPC-8127. The display is not intended for use with digital images from frozen section, cytology, or non-formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (non-FFPE) hematopathology specimens.
