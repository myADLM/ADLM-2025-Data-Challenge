# 5 Device Description

The ACTOnco IVD assay is an in-vitro diagnostic assay intended to provide information for use by qualified health care professionals in accordance with professional guidelines, and is not conclusive or prescriptive for labeled use of any specific therapeutic product.

The assay is a custom targeted sequencing platform, utilizing amplicon-based sequencing, to detect point mutations (single nucleotide variants, or SNVs), small insertions and deletions (Indels), ERBB2 gene amplification, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) in tumor specimens. The assay uses custom DNA primers corresponding to all exons and selected introns of oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, drug metabolism genes, and immune-related genes. Primers are synthesized by a secondary manufacturer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). An overlapping amplicon approach is utilized in which tiled primers are designed to generate multiple overlapping amplicons of the same region to avoid allele dropout. In total, the primers target approximately 1.8Mb of the human genome. Genomic DNA is extracted from FFPE tissue samples.

Sequence libraries are prepared through a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification step to enrich target sequences. Target sequences are tagged with index oligonucleotide to identify individual sample and adaptor oligonucleotide to anchor the amplicon to complimentary oligonucleotides embedded on the surface of the sequencing bead. Target sequences on the sequencing beads are amplified using emulsion PCR before sequencing. Multiple barcoded sequence libraries (from different patients) are pooled and then sequenced on a Thermo Fisher Ion GeneStudio™ S5 Prime System. Sequence reads are then aligned to the reference human genome. By comparing the identity of bases from the tumor DNA and the reference human genome, variant alterations are identified in the tumor.

The assay system includes a sequencing instrument, reagents (DNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing), software (operation of the sequencing instrument and variant calling), and standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the use of the system. ACT Genomics takes the responsibilities in monitoring the instrument; reagents and consumable materials which will be used in the assay process.

Multiple software components will be used in the assay. The NGS raw read analysis will be done using Thermo Fisher software. Variant calling for SNVs, insertions and deletions will be done using Thermo Fisher software. Mutation and variant annotation will be done using software from ACT Genomics, the Cunningham Lab and Golden Helix software. ERBB2 gene amplification will be done using software from Boeva Lab. Tumor Purity and Zygosity will be done using software from Halgamuge Lab (Kaushalya Amarasinghe). Calculations for tumor mutational burden will be done using ACT Genomics software.

# 7 Comparison of Technological Characteristics with The Predicate Device

The ACTOnco IVD test has technological characteristics that are substantially equivalent to the predicate device as described in the tables below. Both the subject device and the predicate device use targeted, high throughput parallel sequencing for the detection genetic alterations. The subject device uses an amplicon-based target enrichment approach and Ion Torrent’s semiconductor sequencing technology, whereas the predicate device used a hybrid capture target enrichment approach and Illumina’s sequencing by synthesis (SBS) technology. Both sequencing platforms have been used in IVD devices that have been either cleared or approved by the FDA.

Both devices use FFPE tumor tissue samples collected from patients with solid malignant neoplasms. The predicate device also uses matched normal samples, which are not required for the ACTOnco IVD test. The ACTOnco IVD test has established a baseline using pooled normal samples, which tumor samples are then compared.

# 8 Performance Testing

# 8.1 Precision / Reproducibility

The objective of this study was to assess within lab precision by evaluating sources of variability (reagent lots, operators, sequencing instruments, and days).

A set of 20 unique samples comprising ten cancer types containing different variants were evaluated. Twelve (12) of the samples across ten cancer types were single clinical samples (FFPE), and eight (8) of them across four cancer types were pooled DNA from multiple FFPE blocks within the same cancer type.

For SNVs, MNVs, insertions, deletions, and copy number variants, all 20 samples were evaluated. For TMB, the 12 unique single FFPE samples were evaluated.

The study design utilized three reagent lots, two instruments, and two operators across twelve (12) non-consecutive days. Duplicate observations for each sample were run. This resulted in 48 observations per level (3 reagent lots $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ operators $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ instruments $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ start days per instrument/operator/reagent lot combination $_ { \textrm { X 2 } }$ replicates). The study design resulted in 24 degrees of freedom for the replicate variability evaluation. Prior to conducting the variance component analysis, all data were visually inspected.

# 8.1.1 SNVs, Insertions and Deletions

Seven hundred fifty-one (751) variants were found within the 20 samples with 638 unique variants and 247 genes.

The qualitative analysis of the data was done using the correct call rate. A correct call was defined as the same mutational variant call within each of the observations of a sample with that variant. Correct calls may be positive (mutation present) or negative (wild type present).

The ACTOnco system evaluated 751 variants in the assay. There were 48 observations of each variant; this resulted in 36,048 total data points $( 7 5 1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 4 8 )$ . Of the 36,048 observations, 32,496 $( 6 7 7 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 4 8 )$ were from SNVs, 1,008 $( 2 1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 4 8 )$ were from MNVs, 528 $\left( 1 1 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 4 8 \right)$ were from insertions, and 2,016 $( 4 2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 4 8 )$ were from deletions. Since this assay has a final QC check at the variant level, there were 142 variant observations removed from the data set due to QC failing at the variant level, resulting in 35,906 variants remaining for the study analysis (36048 – 142).

Across all the mutational variant data, the call rate was $9 8 . 3 3 \%$ (35,308/ 35,906). The breakout for each variant type was as follows:

SNV: $9 8 . 3 3 \%$ 31,837 / 32,377   
INS: $9 6 . 9 7 \%$ 512 / 528   
MNV: $9 7 . 1 8 \%$ 963 / 991   
DEL: $9 9 . 3 0 \%$ 1,996 / 2,010

There were 15,076 WT calls across all the samples, and given 48 observations, this resulted in 723,648 ( $1 5 , 0 7 6 \mathrm { x } 4 8 )$ ) WT calls in the data set. Across all the WT data there were $9 9 . 9 9 7 \%$ correct calls (723,628/723,648). See Table 8-1.

# 8.1.2 ERBB2 Gene Amplification

The same 20 samples with 12 single- FFPE and 8 mixed samples used for SNV and Indel analysis were used for ERBB2 amplification analysis as well. Within the 20 samples, there were 3 samples with ERBB2 amplification. The rest of the samples were ERBB2 no amplification. Within the assay, ERBB2 amplification is reported when the observed copy number for the gene is greater than or equal to 4 copies of the observed copy number determined by the assay.

The qualitative evaluation of the data was done by determining the call rates for the amplification and no amplification samples. There were 48 observations of the ERBB2 gene in each sample, resulting in 960 total observations in this study (20 samples $\times 4 8$ observations per sample). None of the observations were removed in this study. Amongst 960 observations, 144 $( 3 \mathrm { ~ X ~ } 4 8 )$ observations were amplification, and the other 816 $( 1 7 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 4 8 )$ observations were from no amplification. The call rate was $100 \%$ for both amplification and no amplification groups. The summarized data can be found in Table 8-8

# 8.2 Analytical Sensitivity/ Limit of Detection

A study for determining the LoD of the ACTOnco assay for SNVs and INDELs was done by evaluating 10 different cancer specimens with 15 SNVs, 5 insertions and 11 deletions with 5 dilution levels and 5 replicate observations per level. The call rate was determined for each variant and the LOD/C95 was approximated between the call rate that was below $9 5 \%$ and the highest call rate $( 1 0 0 \% )$ . Table 8-10 summarizes the data within mutational types and

Table 8-11 summarizes the estimation of the LoD range for each variant within the subjects evaluated in the study. The call rate here requires the use of the assay cutoff and as such we refer to this as the LOD/C95. Since the concentrations for each level from the underlying internal continuous response values (MAF) were available these are also presented in the tables.

# LoD - Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) and DNA input

To evaluate the LoD for TMB reporting, five (5) FFPE tumor specimens with $\mathrm { T M B } \geq 1 0$ from the LoD SNV supplement study were evaluated. Each sample was serially diluted across 5 levels at 10 replicates per level. The DNA extracted from the 5 FFPE specimens from the LoD supplement study were serially diluted with matched normal DNA across 5 dilution levels with 5 replicates per level per reagent lot (2 were used) resulting in 10 observations per level. The cancer types, tumor purity, mean TMB score, SD, percent CV and average mean exon coverage of all valid replicates are shown below in Table 8-12. Figure 8-1 further visualizes the TMB scores with respective tumor purities. These data show ACTOnco assay has acceptable TMB performance across tumor purities at or above $20 \%$ with the percent CV $< 1 6 \%$ . ACT Genomics is taking a conservative approach and limiting the tumor purity at greater than $30 \%$ .

Figure 8-1: Linearity of TMB score with respective tumor purity calculated by the ACTOnco assay.

The same ten (10) samples used for the SNV/INDEL and ERBB2 copy number analyses were also evaluated for the performance of TMB reporting across the three (3) DNA input levels. Five replicates at each DNA input level for each sample were run. This resulted in 50 observations per DNA level (10 samples x 5 replicates). To evaluate the DNA input level and the tumor purity of ACTOnco TMB assay 3 of the 10 samples tested were at the required tumor purity for the assay and seven (7) of the ten (10) samples were purposely selected for their low tumor purity $( 1 5 \% - 3 0 \% )$ . Table 8-13 summarizes the sample accounting and TMB performance, including the standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) for all 5 replicates for each DNA input level per sample.

# LoD - ERBB2 copy number amplification

In this study, one (1) sample with ERBB2 amplification was evaluated with 5 levels of copy number alteration. Each dilution level was run with 5 replicates per reagent lot, and 2 reagent lots were used. This results in a total of 10 replicates per level, and 50 aliquots per sample. The cutoff for ERBB2 detection is an observed copy number $\geq 4$ .

# 8.3 Analytical Specificity / Interference

The objective of the study was to evaluate the potential impact of endogenous and exogenous interfering substances on the performance of the ACTOnco assay.

Two study designs were implemented. The spike-in approach was used to evaluate interfering substances which were hemoglobin, melanin, and wash buffer that could be spiked into an aliquot of a sample. For a potential interferent that could not be “spiked in” such as necrotic tissue, a compare-to-similar approach was used.

In the spike-in design, all substances were tested using six FFPE specimens representative of six tumor types (skin, breast, colorectal, endometrial, lung cancers and kidney cancer).

469 specimens representing 21 cancer types which enrolled in the Method Comparison study were used in the compare to similar approach and divided into test group (necrotic tissue $\geq$ $10 \%$ ); and control (necrotic tissue $< 1 0 \%$ and matched for mutational variant and level) for analysis. Both the control and test group samples were compared to an appropriate comparator method to determine if the necrotic tissue would alter the agreement of the ACTOnco assay with the comparator.

The specimens included representative variant types in single nucleotide variants (SNV), insertions and deletions (Indels), ERBB2 gene amplification, and tumor mutational burden (TMB).

# 8.3.1 Spike-in study Arm

# SNVs and Indels

Each sample was run as a control (no interferent) and a test (spiked interferent) with 4 replicates in each of the 6 study groups, control (3), hemoglobin (1), melanin (1), wash buffer (1) which resulted in 24 observations (Table 8-14).

One hundred thirty seven (137) variants (126 SNVs, 2 insertions, and 9 deletions) within 104 genes were detected across the 6 samples. A total of 3288 expected positive calls in both controls and test interfering substances were detected which resulted in $100 \%$ positive

corrective calls with the lower bound of a $9 5 \%$ CI across all variants at $9 9 . 8 8 \%$ (Wilson Score, Table 8-15).

Since the same specimens can be wild type for some locations, force calls were made to the hotspot locations within the assay for each sample for the analysis for negative calls. Out of the 122,664 expected wild type observations, 122,656 were detected which resulted in $9 9 . 9 9 \%$ negative corrective calls with the lower bound of a $9 5 \% C \mathrm { I }$ across all WTs at $9 9 . 9 9 \%$ (Wilson Score, Table 8-15).

A total of 126 samples were evaluated by both DISH and ACTOnco, there were 3 samples with discordant call which were removed from the analysis. There were one hundred seven (107) samples were in the control $( < 1 0 \%$ necrotic tissue) and sixteen (16) samples in the test group (necrotic range: 10 to $40 \%$ ). The call agreement for ERBB2 gene amplification was $100 \%$ (35/35) in the control group and $100 \%$ (7/7) in the test group (Table 8-19). The call agreement for ERBB2 gene no amplification was $100 \%$ (72/72) in the control group and $100 \%$ (9/9) in the test group. Since in both cases for either the ERBB2 gene amplification or ERBB2 gene no amplification had $100 \%$ agreement with DISH, these data suggest that up to $40 \%$ necrotic tissues does not act as an interferent for the ACTOnco assay.

# Tumor Mutational Burden

Fifty (50) samples were used to evaluate the TMB and only those samples that had tumor purity above $30 \%$ were used for the study analysis the final n was forty-five (45). For TMB, there were forty one (41) samples in the control group $( < 1 0 \%$ necrotic tissue) and four (4) samples in the test group ( $10 \%$ necrotic tissue). The samples in the test group did not show performance different from the control group.

Based on the results shown in the study, the results showed minimal risk to assay performance from interfering substances and necrosis.

# 8.4 Cross Contamination

Cross-contamination of DNA samples during the library preparation (contamination from one sample to another within the same sequencing run) was assessed using the positive and negative process control samples for the ACTOnco IVD assay.

The study was conducted by evaluating 15 known variants - consisting of SNVs and deletions - in the positive process control sample. These 15 known variants are considered as positive variants. The same 15 genomic locations were evaluated in the assay negative process control, and they are known to be WT in the negative process control sample.

The study was done with a designated pattern of 12 positive control samples alternating with 12 negative control samples within 96-well plate.

All library construction batch and sequencing runs were completed without QC failure or deviation. No positive variants were detected in the negative control samples, and all these 15 positive variants were detected in every positive control samples. Therefore, no crosscontamination was detected.

# 8.5 DNA Input

The objective of this study was to evaluate DNA input levels $( 2 0 , 4 0 , 8 0 \mathrm { n g } )$ on the performance of the ACTOnco Assay for the reporting on SNVs, INDELs, ERBB2 copy number amplification, and TMB. A set of 10 FFPE samples, representative of 8 cancer types, were sequenced to report SNVs, INDELs, ERBB2 copy number amplification, and TMBs. Five replicates at each DNA input level for each sample were run. This resulted in 50

observations per DNA level (10 samples x 5 replicates) and 150 sample observations for the study (10 samples x 5 replicates x 3 levels).

A total of 4230 variant observations were generated. Data was evaluated between the DNA input levels by looking at the QC outcome of the sample and variants at each input level and evaluating the call rates for each variant at each DNA input level. All of the sample level QC metrics passed without issue for all of the input levels. At the variant level, focusing on variants at $5 \%$ with MAF levels between $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ with variant read counts between 1-15, the data summarized in Table 8-20 indicated that the lower input level of $2 0 \mathrm { n g }$ had 13 observations below the variant read count of 10 with 3 of these at MAF levels above the $5 \%$ cutoff as compared to $4 0 \mathrm { n g }$ (15 with 4 above the $5 \%$ cutoff) and $8 0 \mathrm { n g }$ (14 with 1 above the $5 \%$ cutoff). Due to this, the $8 0 \mathrm { n g }$ level was considered as it would allow more template in the sample processing.

The variant calls (positive and negative) for the 10 samples at the DNA input of 20, 40, and $8 0 \mathrm { n g }$ were evaluated by determining the correct calls. The negative process control force calls 755 hotspot variants on all samples and replicates for evaluating variability of negative variant callings. There were a total of 37710 negative calls in the dataset.

Table 8-21 and Table 8-22 summarized the call rates for positive and negative variant callings, respectively for each DNA input level. Furthermore, the call rates for positive and negative variant callings for each DNA input level per sample are shown in Table 8-23 and Table 8-24.

These data indicate the amount of DNA added to the assay behaves the same across all DNA input levels tested with respect to the call rates observed but that $8 0 \mathrm { n g }$ DNA input would be better for variants that are near their respective cutoffs.

# 8.6 DNA Extraction

DNA extraction method was validated based on the invalid rates across multiple tumor types obtained from historical data. The data demonstrated that the DNA extraction has been optimized across tumor types to reasonably conclude that the analytical performance presented in representative across FFPE tumor types. Table 8-25 below shows the historical data for invalid rates from a retrospective review of 1526 specimens tested with ACTOnco. The range of the overall (Pre and Post-run) invalid rates was ranged from $0 \%$ to $2 6 \%$ . The data shows that interference effects from different specimens are not significant across different tumor types where the amount of tumor does not increase the chance that the sample cannot be processed to a final result due to either low tumor purity or insufficient DNA yield.

# 8.7 Method Comparison Data

The method comparison study assesses the concordance between the results of ACTOnco assay and results of an appropriate comparator.

For single nucleotide variants (SNVs), multi-nucleotide variants (MNVs), insertions and deletions (indels), the comparator was a well-validated NGS based assay. For ERBB2 gene amplification, the comparator was HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail test (DISH). For TMB, the comparator was whole exome sequencing (WES, next generation sequencing).

Qualitative data for SNVs, indels, and ERBB2 gene amplification was defined as positive calls and negative calls, comparing to their respective comparators in $2 \times 2$ tables. These values were then calculated as positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) with 2 sided $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals (Wilson Score).

# SNV/Indels

Four hundred thirty eight (438) FFPE samples spanning 21 cancer types were evaluated for SNVs, MNVs, insertions, and deletions between ACTOnco and a well-validated NGS based assay. Across all variant types, the comparator assay detected 1254 mutational variants and of these 1175 were unique observed in 59 exons over 106 genes. Of these, ACTOnco assay detected 1227, resulting in a PPA of $9 7 . 8 5 \%$ ( $9 5 \%$ CI: 96.89 to 98.52).

Within the same samples, the comparator assay reported 457,446 wild type. Of these, 457,319 were also reported as wild type by the ACTOnco assay, resulting in an NPA of 99.97 $9 5 \%$ CI: 99.97 to 99.98).

# ERBB2 Amplification

One hundred twenty nine (129) FFPE samples spanning 21 different cancer types were evaluated for ERRBB2 gene amplification between ACTOnco and Ventana HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail test (DISH). The DISH assay detected 48 ERRBB2 gene amplification within the samples of which the ACTOnco assay detected 44 resulting in a PPA of $9 1 . 6 7 \%$ $9 5 \%$ CI: $8 0 . 4 5 \%$ and $9 6 . 7 1 \%$ ). For the remaining 81 samples detected negative by DISH, ACTOnco detected 81 resulting in a NPA of $100 \%$ , $9 5 \%$ CI: $9 5 . 4 7 \%$ and $100 \%$ ).

There were samples that presented with DNA input levels lower than $8 0 \mathrm { n g }$ which was the recommended input DNA in study protocol. When these were removed from the data set (total data set $\mathrm { n } { = } 1 2 6$ ), there were 45 were positive by Dual ISH; of these, 42 were positive by the ACTOnco assay $( \mathrm { P P A } = 9 3 . 3 3 \%$ $[ 8 2 . 1 4 \% , 9 7 . 7 1 \% ]$ ). The negative sample analysis remained unchanged.

A $2 \times 2$ table of the mutational results with positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) statistics provided in Table 8-32 to Table 8-33.

# TMB

The ACTOnco IVD assay reports a TMB score using the sequenced regions of interest to estimate the number of somatic synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations per megabase of all protein-coding genes. The ability of ACTOnco assay to accurately identify TMB in multiple solid tissue FFPE tumor types was assessed by comparing the variant calls by ACTOnco and WES. This was done on the 45 clinical samples (FFPE) processed in the lab at ACT Genomics. Only mutations that 1) occur in the same sequencing covered region between ACTOnco and WES, and 2) passed QC for both ACTOnco and WES are tallied as mutation counts were evaluated.

Across 14 cancer types (breast, colon adenocarcinoma, endo gland, endometrial, kidney, liver, lung, oral cavity, ovarian, prostate, skin, stomach, pancreas, and urinary), 45 cases were enrolled covering a dynamic range of 0.1-63.2 Muts/Mb. There were 560 mutations for ACTOnco and 554 for WES in the regions that overlapped. Of these ACTOnco and WES matched for 426 of the variants, suggesting that estimated TMB would be overlapping the same variants. The TMB scores calculated from WES and ACTOnco were plotted and a model was fit to the data (Figure 8-3).

Additionally, the Spearman rank coefficient was calculated to determine if the rank ordering of TMB values would be changed between ACTOnco and WES within the data sets evaluated. Assessment of all 45 cases resulted in a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.885.
