# IV. Device/System Characteristics

# A. Device Description

A description of required equipment, software, reagents, vendors, and storage conditions is provided, and is described in the instructions for use (ACT Genomics manual). ACT Genomics assumes responsibility for the device. The assay system includes a sequencing instrument, reagents (DNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing), software (operation of the sequencing instrument and variant calling), and standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the use of the system. ACT Genomics takes the responsibilities in monitoring the instrument; reagents and consumable materials which will be used in the assay process. The device is an NGS-based tumor profiling assay, which sequences tumor specimens to detect mutations.

# 1. Sample Preparation:

The ACTOnco IVD assay (referred to as ACTOnco assay hereafter) requires genomic DNA isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens. The tumor volume and minimum tumor content needed to obtain sufficient DNA for testing to achieve the stated performance are shown in Table 1 below. If the minimum tumor proportion is less than $50 \%$ , the tissue should be macro-dissected to select as much viable tumor as possible and minimize the amount of adjacent non-tumor tissue.

# 2. DNA Extraction:

The ACTOnco assay requires genomic DNA isolated from FFPE tissue. DNA is quantified and concentrated if necessary. Genomic DNA is stored at $- 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until assay initiation. The amount of DNA required to perform the assay is $8 0 ~ \mathrm { n g }$ , with at least $1 5 \%$ of DNA at a fragment length longer than 500 base pairs. DNA proceeds directly to library preparation.

# 3. Library Preparation:

Sequence libraries are prepared by first amplifying the target region with the custom DNA primers corresponding to all exons and selected introns of 440 target genes. The amplicons are enzymatically treated to partially digest the primers and then ligated to the sequencing adaptor oligonucleotide and one of the 96 oligonucleotide barcodes in the Kit. A second PCR reaction is performed to amplify the barcoded library. Quality and quantity of the barcoded library is checked. The sample should be a smear with an average fragment size peak at $1 2 5 { - } 3 0 0 \mathrm { b p } \geq 5 0 \%$ and total amount $\geq 3 \mathrm { n g }$ to ensure subsequent template preparation. The DNA libraries for all samples and controls will then be pooled for the template preparation reaction.

# 4. Template Preparation and Sequencing:

Clonal amplification of the DNA library is performed prior to sequencing. The automated emulsion polymerase chain reaction is performed per protocol. Sequence templates are then be loaded onto chip and sequencing is conducted.

# 5. Data Analysis:

a) Data Management: Sample tracking and archiving of run-associated metadata (barcode number, run name, sample accession number, source (class)) is performed with the following key functions: Tracking sample status through various stages of data analysis; tracking iterations of analysis applied to a give sample; recording versions of databases and algorithms used in analysis; archival of pipeline output files (BAM, VCF) and sequencing run statistics (e.g., total output per chip, and mean depth of coverage).

b) Signal Processing, Base calling, Read Alignment, BAM Generation, and Coverage Statistics: Signal Processing, Base Calling, Read Alignment, BAM Generation, and Coverage statistics are performed by the software. In the sequencing process, the software converts the flow signals to nucleotide bases. Each read is assigned to a barcode in barcode classification. The software then trims barcode and adaptors, and other quality checks. Then, the variant

caller plugin of the software employs a mapping alignment program to align reads to the human reference genome (hg19). Aligned reads are written to a Binary Alignment Map (BAM) file. The BAM file is then used for further data analysis. The coverage analysis plugin of the software computes mean depth of coverage, uniformity of base coverage, and percent reads on target.

c) Read Alignment Quality check: Following the manufacturer’s recommendation, read alignment is used to evaluate the sequencing reaction quality and the corresponding library's quality when an accurate reference is available. Reads are aligned to the sequence of hg19. Any discrepancy in alignment to hg19, whether biological (actual variant) or technical (sequencing error) is listed as a mismatch. Alignment performance metrics are reported using the Alignment Quality (AQ) score, which defines the accuracy of sequencing reads when compared to a reference genome sequence. The aligned length of a read at a given accuracy threshold is defined as the greatest position in the read at which the accuracy in the bases, up to and including the position, meets the accuracy threshold. Accuracy is specified using the Phred $- 1 0 ^ { 1 0 \mathrm { g } 1 0 }$ transformation, where 17 represents an error rate of $2 \%$ b $9 8 \%$ accuracy). The AQ level will decrease in samples with more variations compared to the reference genome, for example, tumor samples with many SNPs and SNVs. The software defaults at “AQ17 Total Bases”. AQ17 is the manufacturer’s default setting which provides a long mean read length with some misalignment allowed to accommodate the mismatch in the samples to be detected.

d) Sample QC check: At the sample level, there are three QC metrics. The first metric is the mean depth for each sample, which ensures each sample is sequenced with enough reads. The mean depth for each sample needs to $\mathsf { b e } \geq 5 0 0  { \mathrm { x } }$ . The second metric is the target base coverage (uniformity). Sequence coverage $\geq 1 0 0 \mathbf { x }$ is required with at least $8 5 \%$ of target regions to meet this coverage metric. The third metric is the sample contamination QC check. Samples are checked for possible contamination through bioinformatic analysis of an SNP profile algorithm to reduce the risk of false-positive calls that could occur as a result of an unexpected contamination event.

e) Mutation calling – single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions and deletions (Indels): The analysis pipeline identifies two classes of mutations: (1) SNVs and (2) indels.

i) Analysis of positive and negative controls: At the sample level, sequencing coverage of $\geq$ 500X is required, and sequence coverage of $\geq 1 0 0 \mathbf { x }$ is required with at least $8 5 \%$ of target regions.   
ii) Filters on sample coverage: Sequencing coverage of $\ge 5 0 0 \mathrm { X }$ is required for tumor samples.   
iii) Filtering for high confidence mutations: Raw SNV and indel calls are subjected to a series of filtering steps to ensure only high-confidence calls are reported. The filter is based on 1) variant frequency that identifies as a possible somatic mutation; 2) a known hotspot mutation; 3) technical characteristics such as total depth, variant read count, and strand bias, 4) background signal observed in in-house normal samples, and 5) not a common artefact.

The thresholds for hotspot variants are $\geq 2 \%$ variant frequency and for non-hotspot variants are $\ge 5 \%$ . There must be no evidence of strand bias, as determined by a strand bias $< 0 . 9$ . The total depth which must be $\geq 3 5$ with the variant read count which must be $\geq 5$ for hotspot and $\geq 1 0$ for non-hotspot to be considered as a variant. The variants that had $\ge 5 \%$ mutational allele frequency in any in-house normal samples are removed. Using a machine learning model trained from manually reviewed variants, majority of artefacts are removed, while retaining variants at hotspots or on clinically significant genes for manual inspection.

The filtering scheme and threshold are shown in Figure 1 below. The threshold values for the filtering criteria were established based on mutation analysis on replicates of normal FFPE samples, and optimized to reject all false positive SNVs and almost all false positive indel calls from the reference dataset.

f) Mutation Annotation: Variants with functional effects of point mutations, frameshifts, inframe insertion or deletions, splice site, and splice region variants are retained. Common polymorphisms from gnomAD, and in-house normal sample database are removed.

g) Tumor Purity Analysis: The tumor purity of the sequenced sample may be different from the tumor proportion determined by the pathologists using the entire pathology slide if the sample has been subjected to macrodissection. The tumor purity of the sequenced sample is determined by the software, which considers sequencing reads information, allele frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms, and possible genomic typing. Manual inspection is

performed to determine tumor purity by considering pathologist-determined tumor proportion and driver mutation mutational allele frequency in cases when a limitation in the software is identified.

h) Copy Number Analysis: Copy number analysis determines the amplification status of the ERBB2 gene by measuring the read coverage of a large segment of the ERBB2 gene relative to the rest of the sequenced region using the software. It includes two steps: (1) Read coverage data is compared to data from a pooled normal baseline and normalized to arrive at a normalized coverage ratio. (2) The observed copy number is determined by assigning the ratio value for the situation when copy number is two, and then determining the copy number based on the ratio at ERBB2 gene. ERBB2 gene is reported as amplification if the observed copy number is $\geq 4$ .

i) Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB): TMB is calculated based on detected sequence mutations. Filtering of sequence mutations is performed to exclude low mutant allele fraction mutations $( < 5 \%$ MAF), common somatic driver mutations, and common germline mutations. Both synonymous and non-synonymous alterations are considered for the mutation load. TMB is reported as the number of mutations per megabase (Muts/Mb).

# 6. Controls:

a) Positive control: The positive control sample (commercial vendor qualified by ACT Genomics) contains different confirmed mutations, representing a range of mutation allele frequencies. Data generated from the positive control sample is analyzed using the pipeline, and frequencies of the detected mutations are reviewed to determine if (1) the known mutations are among those called, and (2) the observed frequencies for the known mutations match their expected values within a tolerance interval covering $9 9 . 9 \%$ proportion with $9 5 \%$ confidence. The positive control with expected mutational variant frequency (MAF) are shown in Table 2.

b) Negative control: The negative control sample uses peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy population which are lacking any clinically relevant genetic alterations in target areas. The assay will interrogate 755 hotspot locations and the expected outcome should be negative for a mutational call, that is, result in a wild-type call or no mutation found.

c) No Template Control: DNAse, RNAse free distilled water will be used as the no template control sample, and will be included into library preparation to verify that there is no contamination of reagents. The library product of the no template control sample is analyzed by capillary electrophoresis (Fragmented Analyzer) before samples proceed to sequencing. The no template control should have no detectable major peak at 125-300bp and an undetectable concentration.

# 7. Result Reporting:

 ACTOnco results are reported out under one of the two categories: “Cancer Mutations with Evidence of Clinical Significance” or “Cancer Mutations with Potential Clinical Significance”. The two categories are based on the supporting level of clinical evidence. Results are reported for point mutations and small insertions and deletions of the 440 gene panel. Refer to Appendix A for a list of genes. The ACTOnco does not report mutations in 650 regions among 18431 interrogated target regions (528 regions due to consistently low coverage in 187 genes and 124 regions due to pseudogene in 24 genes). Refer to Appendix B for a list of excluded exons.   
 ERBB2 gene is reported as amplification if the observed copy number is $\geq 4$ .   
TMB reporting: TMB is measured by counting the total number of mutations detected in the consensus coding region (1.12Mb) interrogated by ACTOnco assay. TMB is measured as mutations per megabase (mut/Mb), reported as a number.   
 Reporting takes in account the quality metrics listed in the Table 3 below.

# 8. Quality Metrics:

Quality metrics are assessed across the following categories:

 Run (Batch) level: Metrics that are quantified per sequencing run. If the run (batch)-level metrics failed, all the samples in that run will need to be re-sequenced. Sample level: Metrics that are quantified per sample. If the sample-level QC failed, the sample will be flagged for inspection or rework of the library or re-sequenced. Variant (analyte) level: Metrics that are quantified for individual alteration types and positions, such as sequence coverage. Variants passing analyte-level QC are reported.

# B. Test Principle

The ACTOnco assay is a custom targeted sequencing platform, utilizing amplicon-based sequencing, to detect point mutations (single nucleotide variants, or SNVs), small insertions and deletions (Indels), ERBB2 gene amplification, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) in tumor specimens. The ACTOnco assay involves target amplification and deep sequencing of all coding exons of 440 genes. The assay uses custom DNA primers corresponding to all exons and selected introns of oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, drug metabolism genes, and immune-related genes. An overlapping amplicon approach is utilized in which tiled primers are designed to generate multiple overlapping amplicons of the same region to avoid allele dropout. In total, the primers target approximately 1.8Mb of the human genome. Genomic DNA is extracted from FFPE tissue samples.

Sequence libraries are prepared through a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification step to enrich target sequences. Target sequences are tagged with index oligonucleotide to identify individual sample and adaptor oligonucleotide to anchor the amplicon to complimentary oligonucleotides embedded on the surface of the sequencing bead. Target sequences on the sequencing beads are amplified using emulsion PCR before sequencing. Multiple barcoded sequence libraries are pooled and then sequenced; sequence reads are then aligned to the reference human genome. By comparing the identity of bases from the tumor DNA and the reference human genome, variant alterations are identified in the tumor.

# C. Determination of assay thresholds

# 1. Requirements on exon coverage:

A power analysis was conducted to estimate the depth or the total number of reads needed to detect a mutation with a true underlying mutation allele frequency (MAF) of $2 \%$ or greater, for varying levels of power (0.8 to 0.99), assuming a fixed alpha (Type I error rate) of 0.05. The $9 5 \%$ confidence interval (CI) ranges of observed MAF as a function of sequencing depth were also calculated. The study showed that when a mutation is present at $10 \%$ , the $9 5 \%$ CI with a sequencing depth of 500X is expected to fall between $7 . 5 \%$ and $1 3 \%$ . When the overall coverage is 100X, the $9 5 \%$ CI for a mutation at $10 \%$ is estimated to fall between $5 . 0 \%$ and $1 7 . 6 \%$ .

To confirm these estimates, empirical data was obtained to measure the range of observed MAF for expected MAF using DNA from 20 normal tissue FFPE samples of unrelated individuals mixed in equimolar parts to create a range of SNPs with expected frequencies as low as $2 . 5 \%$ . A total of 890 common SNPs were considered for this experiment.

A boxplot in Figure 2 shows the observed mutation frequencies for the 890 common SNPs genotyped in the pooled DNA sample binned by their true underlying mutation frequency. The empirical data showed a consistent correlation between expected and observed MAF (Pearson’s r $= 0 . 9 9 )$ with a slope of 0.99 and an intercept of 0.001. The results demonstrated that an observed VF range from $8 . 3 \%$ to $1 5 . 6 \%$ for an SNP with a true underlying mutation frequency of $10 \%$ when the mean depth of the sample was 1056X. This range in values is roughly in line with what the theoretical statistical assessment for a depth of 500X $7 . 5 \%$ to $1 3 . 0 \%$ ). This data provided support for using $5 \%$ as the lower limit for reporting mutations detected with a true underlying frequency of $10 \%$ . Furthermore, for the variant with an expected MAF equal to $5 \%$ , the lower bound of observed variant frequency is $2 \%$ , suggesting that an observed MAF of $2 \%$ can be used to detect actual $5 \%$ variants.

Figure 2. Observed vs Expected Variant Frequency

# 2. Requirements on sample coverage:

Eighteen normal FFPE samples were profiled using ACTOnco to generate summary statistics across all target exons. The mean coverage across all amplicons was 1102X (640X-1445X, $\mathrm { S D } { = } 2 3 0 \mathrm { X }$ ). The percentage of ${ \displaystyle > } 1 0 0 \mathrm { X }$ amplicon coverage was $9 2 \%$ $9 0 - 9 3 \%$ , $\mathrm { S D { = } 0 . 8 \% }$ ). When the amplicons were mapped to the exon level, the mean coverage across all targeted exons was 1121X (647X-1472X, $\mathrm { S D } { = } 2 3 2 \mathrm { X }$ ). Summary statistics were also computed based on coverage values per exon normalized by per-sample coverage. There were exons that presented with consistently low coverage values. None of the exons of the genes in clinical validation are among those with consistently low coverage. It was determined the low coverage was due to sequence similarity with other loci, poor amplification efficiency, and high GC content. The exons with consistently low coverage were removed from the ACTOnco assay.

Sequence coverage was further evaluated to establish minimum criteria for the analysis and reporting of variants. A 100X minimum coverage threshold per exon is required based on the power calculation, which showed 100X coverage was necessary to call mutations with true underlying mutation frequency of $10 \%$ or greater, with $9 5 \%$ power at an alpha level of 0.05. Of the remaining exons across all genes, $9 9 . 1 \%$ $( 9 7 . 7 { - } 9 9 . 7 \%$ , $S _ { Ḋ } \mathrm { D } \mathrm { = } 0 . 5 \%$ ) were sequenced to a depth of 100X or greater. The distribution of the mean coverage value and median coverage value for the targeted exon were shown in the below Figure 3.

![](images/4a7cd1a9cdc97a76131b591c196af917393785122edc99d24772b34ba0305866.jpg)  
Figure 3. Distribution of mean and median coverage values for targeted regions of ACTOnco test using 18 samples with higher coverage. Dashed line indicates 100X coverage.

A second set of 20 samples with lower sequencing depth was evaluated using the same analysis. The mean coverage across all amplicons was 572X (471X-637X, $\mathrm { S D } { = } 4 6 \mathrm { X }$ ). The percentage of ${ \displaystyle > } 1 0 0 \mathrm { X }$ amplicon coverage was $9 1 . 1 \%$ b $8 7 . 9 { - } 9 2 . 7 \%$ , $\mathrm { S D { = } l . 1 \% }$ ). When the amplicons were mapped to the exon level, the mean coverage across all targeted exons was 616X (495X-695X, $\mathrm { S D } { = } 5 4 \mathrm { X }$ ). With the same remaining exons across all genes, $9 7 . 8 \% \%$ $( 9 7 . 1 - 9 8 . 9 \%$ , $\mathrm { S D { = } } 0 . 5 \%$ ) were sequenced to a depth of 100X or greater. The distribution of the mean coverage value and median coverage value for the targeted exon were shown in the below Figure 4.

Figure 4. Distribution of mean and median coverage values for targeted regions of ACTOnco test using 20 samples with lower coverage. Dashed line indicates 100X coverage.

Based on the two studies above, the threshold of a minimum of $8 5 \%$ of amplicon must have 100X was established for the ACTOnco test.

# 3. Requirements on mutation coverage, allele depth and frequency for positive calls:

Variant calling parameters such as sequence coverage (allele depth, AO), variant coverage (variant read, DP) and strand bias (SB) were assessed as filters for specificity while maintaining the ability to detect true positive calls. Thresholds were established to ensure specificity is maintained at targeted MAF levels for reporting. Mutation thresholds were established at $2 \%$ and $5 \%$ for sequence mutations based on a categorization with somatic hotspots and non-hotspots positions.

The cutoffs for AO, DP, and SB for hotspot variants and non-hotspot variants were established using two development studies. The first study was designed to select the best parameter cutoff combination using a dataset of 17 ACTOnco run using a Reference Standard. Three parameters each were evaluated with multiple cutoffs to generate a total of 6888 combinations. A list of 3844 positive variants and 9146 negative variants was used to evaluate the performance of each parameter combination. The cutoff combination which generates the best positive predictive value was selected. The second study aimed to determine the cutoff for variant read count. The study used 18 non-cancer FFPE samples and evaluate a total of 858 hotspot variants and 2359 non-hotspot variants at different variant read cutoffs. The lowest read count which can filter out $5 9 9 . 5 \%$ of noise variants (5 for hotspot variants, 10 reads for non-hotspot variants) was selected as the cutoff.

# F. Performance Characteristics:

# 1. Analytical Performance- General

The ACTOnco assay is a targeted NGS panel with 440 genes. The targeted regions of interest in ACTOnco are designed to detect SNVs, deletions up to 19bp and insertions up to 12bp in length of the targeted genes, as well as ERBB2 amplifications, and TMB. For SNVs and indels, a representative approach to validation of the targeted genes in the panel was submitted with data representing variant types for SNVs and indels, and at the gene level for amplification indicated with this assay. In addition, the assay was evaluated for performance regarding the panel wide quality metrics.

# a) Invalid Rates

The invalid rates across multiple tumor types obtained from historical data was evaluated with 1526 FFPE clinical specimens tested with the ACTOnco assay. The data shows the separate invalid rates for the different steps involved in the assay workflow including the percentage of specimens with insufficient tumor, DNA integrity and yield, the percentage with failed library prep and the percentage that failed the sequencing run per cancer type (Table 6). The overall (Pre and Post-run) invalid rates ranged from $0 \%$ to $2 6 \%$ principally due to insufficient tumor and insufficient DNA yield related to the specimen source. The data shows that the DNA extraction is valid across tumor types and interference effects from different specimens are not significant across different tumor types supporting the performance of the pan-tumor specimen handling.

# 2. Precision

# a) Precision Panel

The within lab precision (between-run and within-run) of the ACTOnco assay was assessed using 20 FFPE clinical samples (12 single samples across 10 tumor types and 8 mixed samples across 4 tumor types) to represent different tumor types, different variants, and the range of frequencies. Extracted DNA from each of the 20 samples was tested in duplicate by 2 different operators on 2 instruments across 2 non- consecutive start days using 3 kit lots, yielding 48 replicates per sample. For each replicate tested, all observed mutations which passed the ACTOnco assay QC metrics were reported and assessed for precision. The single samples or mixed samples with known mutations corresponding to FDA level 2 variants (mutations with evidence of clinical significance) and level 3 variants (mutation with evidence of potential clinical significance) are shown in Table 7 and Table 8, respectively. Among the 12 single samples, one sample does not contain any variants with FDA level 2 or level 3 and is not listed in Table 7.

# b) Panel-wide precision for SNVs and Indels

The precision was assessed for all detected mutations across 48 replicates for each sample. The positive and negative call rates were calculated based on the total number of mutations along with the two-sided $9 5 \%$ CI. Table 9 summarizes the positive and negative call rates rolled up (mutational variant type, operator, instrument, reagent lot, and days). The overall positive call rate was $9 8 . 3 \%$ across all samples and replicates (35,308/ 35,906, $9 8 . 2 \% 9 8 . 5 \% \mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ I). The

overall negative call rate was $9 9 . 9 9 7 \%$ across all samples and replicates (723,628/ 723,648, $9 9 . 9 9 6 \% 9 9 . 9 9 8 \% \mathrm { C I } _ { }$ ).

\* Correct calls may be positive (mutation present) or negative (wild type present). A correct call was defined as the same mutational variant call with each of the observations of a sample with that variant.

In addition to the mutations with FDA level (as listed in Table 7 and Table 8), other mutations identified in each specimen in any of the test replicates were evaluated $\mathrm { ( n = 7 5 1 }$ ) with 48 replicates each. Amongst the 751 mutations, 662 mutations had $100 \%$ correct calls, 37/751 mutations had $\ge 9 0 \%$ correct calls, 32/751 mutations $\mathrm { h a d } \geq 5 0 \%$ correct calls, and only 5/751 mutations had $< 5 0 \%$ correct calls. Note the $\leq 5 0 \%$ correct calls were for variants where the mean MAF was at their respective cutoff (2 or $5 \%$ ). There were $1 5 / 7 5 1$ mutations with $100 \%$ correct call but the total observations were not 48 due to loss of observations due to assay QC.

The coefficient of variance (CV) for the MAF was also calculated for all replicates. Two hundred and eighty-three (283) of the 386 $( 7 3 \% )$ mutations in the single samples had a percent $C V \leq 1 0 \%$ , 88 of 386 $( 2 3 \% )$ were between 10 and $20 \%$ , and 15 of 386 $( 4 \% )$ were $> 2 0 \%$ . In the mixed samples, 133/365 $( 3 7 \% )$ had a percent $C V \leq 1 0 \%$ , 195/365 $( 5 3 \% )$ were between 10 and $20 \%$ , and 37/365 $( 1 0 \% )$ were $> 2 0 \%$ .

Positive call rates for known mutations with FDA level 2 or level 3 listed in Table 7 and Table 8 are summarized in Table 10 and Table 11, respectively.

# c) Per-Specimen Precision for SNVs and Indels

Precision was calculated for each individual specimen as shown in Table 12 (single samples) and Table 13 (mixed samples). Results from the precision studies were combined across all reportable genes for each specimen.

# d) Precision for ERBB2 amplification

Precision of ERBB2 amplification was evaluated across the same set of 20 samples (12 single and 8 mixed). Each sample was tested in duplicate by 2 different operators on 2 instruments across 2 non- consecutive start days using 3 kit lots, yielding 48 replicates per sample. Within the 20 samples, 3 samples contained ERBB2 amplification and the rest of the samples contained no ERBB2 amplification. The assay reports ERBB2 amplification when the observed copy number for the gene is greater than or equal to 4 copies of the observed copy number determined by the assay. The mean observed copy number (CNV), observed copy number range, standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation $( \% C V )$ , positive call rate along with $9 5 \%$ CI for each sample with ERBB2 amplification are summarized in Table 14. The call rates were $100 \%$ for both amplification and no amplification groups.

# e) Precision for TMB

Precision of TMB was evaluated across 12 single samples with TMB scores ranging from 0.7 to 45.8. Specimens spanned the range of TMB scores and included 10 different tumor types. The tumor purity for these samples ranged from $3 2 . 5 \%$ to $7 2 . 7 \%$ . The mean TMB score, SD, $\% \mathrm { C V }$ and mean target region coverage for each sample are shown in Table 15. The calculated $\% \mathrm { C V }$ for samples with TMB scores ${ > } 5$ are less than $10 \%$ except sample 9, which contains the highest percentage of SNVs with low MAF $( < 1 0 \% )$ in the whole sample sets. Overall, the data supports a repeatable TMB reporting by the ACTOnco assay.

# 3. Analytical Sensitivity - Limit of Detection (LoD):

The LoD of the ACTOnco assay for SNVs and indels is defined as the MAF at which $9 5 \%$ of replicates for a variant type are reliably detected. The LoDs of the ACTOnco assay for ERBB2 amplification and TMB is determined as the minimum tumor purity required for robust reporting of amplification status and TMB scores, respectively. The recommended DNA input for the ACTOnco assay is $8 0 \mathrm { n g }$ of total DNA, with a minimum tumor purity of $30 \%$ for TMB reporting.

# a) LoD – SNVs and Indels:

The LoD of the ACTOnco assay for SNVs and indels was evaluated by assessing 10 clinical FFPE specimens from 8 different cancer types with 15 SNVs, 5 insertions and 11 deletions. Each sample was diluted to 5 dilution levels and tested in 5 replicates per level using two reagent lots. The call rate was determined for each variant and the LoD/C95 was approximated between the call rate that was below $9 5 \%$ and the highest call rate $( 1 0 0 \% )$ . Table 16 is a summary of the estimation of the LoD range for each variant along with the cutoff within the entire panel evaluated in the study. The established MAF range for each variant type (Hotspot SNVs, Non-hotspot SNVs, insertions and deletion) is shown in Table 17.

# b) LoD - Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB)

The minimum tumor purity requirement for input into the ACTOnco assay is $30 \%$ . The minimum tumor purity required for robust reporting of TMB scores by ACTOnco assay was confirmed using 5 clinical FFPE specimens with TMB score ${ \ge } 1 0$ from the LoD study. DNA extracted from each sample was serially diluted to 5 levels with matched normal DNA and tested in 5 replicates per level per reagent lot (2 lots were used), resulting in 10 observations per level. The cancer types, tumor purity, mean TMB score, SD, $\% \mathrm { C V }$ and average mean exon coverage of all valid replicates are shown below in Table 18.

Figure 5. further visualizes the TMB scores with respective tumor purities. This data demonstrates a robust reporting of TMB scores by the ACTOnco assay across tumor purities at or above $20 \%$ with $\% { \mathrm { C V } } < 1 6 \%$ , supporting the minimum tumor purity requirement of $30 \%$ . In addition, data obtained from the DNA input and precision study also demonstrate a robust reporting of TMB scores by the ACTOnco assay when testing specimens with tumor purity close to $30 \%$ .

Figure 5. Linearity of TMB score with respective tumor purity calculated by the ACTOnco assay.

Analytical sensitivity of ERBB2 was assessed by testing 1 clinical breast cancer sample diluted with normal FFPE DNA to 5 detection levels (variants at low tumor purity). Each dilution level was run in 5 replicates per reagent lot (2 lots were used), resulting in a total of 10 replicates per level per sample. The cutoff for ERBB2 detection is an observed copy number $\geq 4$ . The data summarized in Table 19 showed $100 \%$ call rates for samples with tumor purity over $10 \%$ and two lots of reagents yielded similar results. These findings were further supported by data obtained from the DNA input study, in which 2 FFPE clinical specimen with low tumor purity and ERBB2 copy numbers near the cutoff were evaluated in 5 replicates (Table 24 under DNA input study for ERBB2).

# 4. Linearity/assay reportable range

Not applicable

# 5. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or methods)

The ACTOnco IVD assay is not traceable to any known standard. Controls and quality metrics are described in the device description section.

# 6. Stability:

Reagent stability is based on manufacturer expiration dating, and supported by ACT Genomics verification. Stability of the reagents is monitored through the use of consistent controls.

# 7. Expected values (controls):

The positive control sample (commercial vendor qualified by ACT Genomics) contains different confirmed mutations, representing a range of mutation allele frequencies. The positive control is processed from library preparation through sequencing to serve as an end to end control to demonstrate assay performance. It is checked for quality during library preparation and after sequencing. Failure of the control to meet the pre-defined quality metrics will result in all test samples on the run be flagged and re-sequenced.

# 8. Analytical Specificity:

# a) Interfering Substance

To evaluate the potential impact of endogenous and exogenous interfering substances on the performance of the ACTOnco assay, 6 clinical FFPE samples were tested in 4 replicates in the presence and absence of each interfering substance (hemoglobin at $4 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ , melanin at $1 \mathrm { n g / \mu L }$ , and wash buffer at $5 \%$ ). Analysis of all variant types tested (SNVs/indels, ERBB2 copy number alterations and TMB) showed no effect of exogenous interferent for all conditions (Table 20-21 and Figure 6-8). The results showed minimal risk to assay performance from interfering substances.

# Necrotic Tissue

The impact of necrosis on the performance of ACTOnco assay was evaluated by assessing the DNA yield and DNA quality metrics across 469 FFPE samples in the accuracy study. Concordance for all variant types between the test group (necrotic tissue ranged: $1 0 - 5 0 \% )$ and the control group (necrotic tissue $< 1 0 \%$ ) were also evaluated. The data indicated there is no correlation between necrosis and DNA yield/quality, nor between necrosis and variant reporting.

# b) Sample Cross-Contamination

Cross-contamination of DNA samples during the library preparation (contamination from one sample to another within the same sequencing run) was assessed using the positive and negative process control samples for the ACTOnco assay. The study was performed in a designated checkerboard pattern of 12 positive control samples alternating with 12 negative control samples within 96-well plate. All library construction batch and sequencing runs were completed without QC failure or deviation. No positive variants were detected in the negative control samples, and all 15 known positive variants were detected in each positive control sample. Therefore, no cross-contamination was observed.

# a) DNA Input

The recommended amount of input DNA for the ACTOnco assay is $8 0 ~ \mathrm { n g }$ . A DNA Input study was performed to demonstrate the analytical performance of the ACTOnco assay across a range of DNA input (20, 40, $8 0 ~ \mathrm { n g } )$ using 10 FFPE clinical specimens representative of 8 cancer types. Each sample was tested in 5 replicates at each DNA input level to report SNVs, indels, ERBB2 copy number amplification, and TMBs. The QC metrics and variant reporting for each sample was evaluated per DNA input level. All of the sample level QC metrics passed for all input levels. The variant level QC results indicate that the $8 0 \mathrm { n g }$ input allows for less of a chance that the variant read count (VRC) will fail as the variant MAF approaches its assay cutoff, possibly due to more template in the assay (Table 22).

# DNA Input – SNVs and Indels:

The variant calls (positive and negative) for the 10 samples at the DNA input of 20, 40, and 80 ng were evaluated by determining the correct calls. The call rates for the positive variants at the DNA input level of $2 0 \mathrm { n g }$ , $4 0 \mathrm { n g }$ , and $8 0 \mathrm { n g }$ were $9 7 . 6 \%$ (1315/1347), $9 7 . 5 \%$ (1309/1342), and $9 7 . 2 \%$ (1305/1342), respectively (Table 23). The call rates for the negative variants (WT) at each DNA input level were all $1 0 0 . 0 \%$ across 3 DNA input levels (data not shown). This data indicates that the amount of DNA added to the assay behaves the same across all DNA input levels tested with respect to the observed call rates but that 80ng DNA input would be better for variants that are near their respective cutoffs (data not shown).

# DNA Input – ERBB2:

The DNA input for ERBB2 reporting was evaluated with 2 FFPE tumor specimen with ERBB2 amplification near the cutoff at low tumor purity in 5 replicates. The results shown in Table 24 below support the reporting of ERBB2 amplification by the ACTOnco assay across 3 DNA input levels tested for samples with low tumor purity of $30 \%$ .

# DNA input for TMB

Among the 10 samples assessed for TMB analyses across 3 DNA input levels (20, 40, and 80 ng), 7 of them were selected at low tumor purity $( 1 5 \% - 3 0 \% )$ to assess the repeatability of ACTOnco assay for TMB reporting with minimum tumor content. Performance of TMB at the recommended tumor purity $( > 3 0 \% )$ was found to be consistent across all DNA input levels, regardless of TMB scores (Table 25). This data indicates that the DNA input of $8 0 \mathrm { n g }$ is recommended for the ACTOnco assay.

# 10. Method Comparison (Accuracy)

The analytical accuracy of the ACTOnco assay as a tumor profiling device was evaluated using clinical FFPE samples, obtained from patients with a variety of tumor types. Data was aggregated at the variant level for SNVs, MNVS, insertions and deletions, gene level for ERBB2 gene amplification and sample/ case level for TMB. The PPA and NPA were calculated by comparing the concordance between the ACTOnco Assay and the appropriate comparator.

# a) Accuracy – SNVs and Indels

The accuracy of the ACTOnco assay was assessed by comparing ACTOnco results to results obtained from an externally validated NGS assay (referred to as Ev-NGS assay hereafter). A total of 438 FFPE tumor samples from clinical cases spanning 21 cancer types were assessed in this analysis, representing mutations covering 1034 SNVs, 12 MNVs, 43 insertions and 86 deletions over 106 genes. The Ev-NGS assay detected 1254 mutational variants, of these, ACTOnco assay detected 1227, resulting in a PPA of $9 7 . 8 5 \%$ ( $9 5 \%$ CI: $9 6 . 8 9 \%$ to $9 8 . 5 2 \%$ ).

Within the same sample set, the Ev-NGS assay reported 457,446 wild type. Of these, 457,319 were also reported as wild type by the ACTOnco assay, resulting in an NPA of 99.97 ( $9 5 \%$ CI: $9 9 . 9 7 \%$ to $9 9 . 9 8 \%$ ). This data is summarized in Table 26 and Table 27 below.

# b) Accuracy – Concordance to DISH for ERBB2 amplification

In total 129 FFPE samples representing 21 different cancer types were evaluated for ERBB2 gene amplification between the ACTOnco assay and HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail test (DISH). Of these, 3 samples were tested with DNA input levels lower than $8 0 \mathrm { n g }$ and therefore were not included in the analysis, resulting a total data set of 126 samples. The concordance between the ACTOnco assay and DISH was calculated (Table 31). The DISH assay detected ERRBB2 gene amplification in 45 samples, of which the ACTOnco assay detected 42, resulting in a PPA of $9 3 . 3 3 \%$ b $9 5 \%$ CI: $8 2 . 1 4 \%$ and $9 7 . 7 1 \%$ ). For the remaining 81 samples that were negative by DISH, all 81 were negative by ACTOnco, resulting in a NPA of $1 0 0 . 0 0 \%$ $9 5 \%$ CI: $9 5 . 4 7 \%$ and $1 0 0 . 0 0 \%$ ) as shown in Table 32. According to the labeling for DISH, if the DISH ratio falls between 1.8 to 2.2, a new ratio should be formed with an additional 20 nuclei for the ERBB2 status determination. Of the 126 samples tested by DISH assay, 3 samples were within the DISH ratio 1.8-2.2. Also, of the 126 samples tested by DISH assay, 30 samples were within the DISH ratio 1.5-2.5, which is close to the cutoff of 2. Therefore, additional analysis of PPA and NPA for cases excluding DISH borderline cases (1.8-2.2), cases only with DISH scores 1.8- 2.2, and cases only with DISH scores 1.5-2.5 separately is provided in Table 32. The data shows a NPA of $100 \%$ for all categories, while PPA of cases excluding DISH 1.8-2.2 is $9 5 . 4 5 \%$ and PPA of cases excluding DISH 1.5-2.5 is $9 5 . 2 4 \%$ . Of the 3 samples that yielded discordant results (negative by ACTOnco but positive by DISH), 1 sample was within DISH ratio of 1.8- 2.2.

# c) Accuracy – TMB

The ACTOnco assay reports a TMB score using the sequenced regions of interest to estimate the number of somatic synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations per megabase of all proteincoding genes. The ability of ACTOnco assay to accurately identify TMB in multiple solid tissue FFPE tumor types was assessed by comparing TMB rates generated by ACTOnco assay to whole exome sequencing (WES) results. Across 14 cancer types (breast, colon adenocarcinoma, endo gland, endometrial, kidney, liver, lung, oral cavity, ovarian, prostate, skin, stomach, pancreas, and urinary), 45 FFPE clinical cases were enrolled covering a dynamic range of 0.1- 63.2 Muts/Mb. In total, 560 mutations were detected by the ACTOnco and 554 were detected by WES in the overlapping regions. Of these, 426 variants were detected by both ACTOnco and WES, suggesting that the estimated TMB would be overlapping the same variants. The TMB scores calculated from WES and ACTOnco were plotted and a model was fit to the data as shown in Figure 9. Based on a regression analysis, the estimated slope and intercept are 0.921 (0.781, 1.061) and 1.047 (0.046, 1.649), respectively (Table 33). In addition, the Spearman rank coefficient was calculated to determine if the rank ordering of TMB values would be changed between ACTOnco and WES within the data sets evaluated. Assessment of all 45 cases resulted in a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.885.
