# Controls:

Positive and negative tissue controls that are fixed and processed in the same manner as the test specimens should be used when performing this test. Positive and negative control tissue is used to confirm that the assay performed as expected. For optimal quality control, cervical carcinoma or CIN2/3 cervical tissue positive for CINtec Histology staining is suitable for use as a positive tissue control, and normal cervical tissue is suitable for use as a negative tissue control. Normal human tonsil tissue is also suitable for use as a tissue control, as tonsil contains both positive and negative staining elements when stained with CINtec Histology. Within normal tonsil tissue, there is nuclear and/or cytoplasmic staining of scattered squamous epithelial cells primarily in crypt epithelium and scattered follicular dendritic cells in germinal centers and absence of staining in the majority of lymphocytes.

A negative reagent control mouse monoclonal antibody shall be used to evaluate nonspecific staining. This negative reagent control should be used to stain an adjacent section of the patient specimen tissue on a separate slide from the CINtec Histology slide. The staining protocol for the negative reagent control antibody should be the same as that for the primary antibody.

# B Principle of Operation:

CINtec Histology is an immunohistochemistry device used to stain FFPE cervical punch biopsy tissue slides for the visualization of the $\mathrm { p } 1 6 ^ { \mathrm { I N K 4 a } }$ protein. The test process involves the sequential application of antibodies and a chromogen, with interposed washing steps. The assay steps are as follows: 1) the anti-p16 antibody specifically binds to an epitope in the $\dot { \mathsf { p } } 1 6 ^ { \mathrm { I N K 4 a } }$ protein; 2) a HQ-labeled secondary antibody binds to the primary antibody (HQ is a proprietary hapten covalently linked to the secondary antibody); 3) a tertiary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)- labeled antibody directed against HQ binds to the HQ-labeled secondary antibody; and 4) the resulting complex is visualized with hydrogen peroxide and DAB, due to the formation of a visible brown precipitate at the antigen site. The specimen slide is then counterstained with hematoxylin and cover slipped. Results are interpreted using a light microscope by a pathologist.

# Interpretation of Results

CINtec Histology is a qualitative test. The results are interpreted as either positive or negative based on the p16 staining pattern in the FFPE cervical tissue section.

Positive Result: A positive result is defined as “diffuse” staining which is continuous staining of cells in the basal and parabasal cell layers of the cervical squamous epithelium, with or without staining of the intermediate or intermediate to superficial cell layers. Diffuse staining of any intensity is considered to be positive for CINtec Histology status. In some specimens, nuclear expression may be faint or undetectable, but nuclear p16 staining is not required to interpret the CINtec Histology status. Cellular p16 staining for CINtec Hisology may be nuclear and/or cytoplasmic.

Negative Result: A negative result is defined as either focal staining of the cervical epithelium or absence of the p16 staining in the cervical epithelium. Focal staining is defined as staining of isolated cells or small cell clusters, i.e., a non-continuous staining pattern, and particularly not in the basal and parabasal cells.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name:

VENTANA BenchMark ULTRA instrument which fully automates the processes of baking, deparaffinization, and staining. The BenchMark ULTRA instrument is composed of four main modular components that work together as a system: 1) a stainer subassembly where all slide processing operations are performed containing a reagent carousel, dispenser mechanism, barcode readers, heating elements and other components; 2) an automated fluidics subassembly that provides the compressed air and bulk fluids required by the stainer subassembly; 3) a waste bottle subassembly that collects the waste generated by the system during staining operations; and, 4) a personal computer (PC) running on a Microsoft Windows platform that controls and monitors the system through the Ventana System Software (VSS) host operating software.

# 2. Specimen Identification:

Specimen identification is performed through the VSS host operating software. Barcodes reflecting the specific protocols for the CINtec Histology assay are printed by the user and affixed to the appropriate patient specimen slides. Prior to starting the assay run, the barcodes on the slides and dispensers are scanned and qualified by the host software to ensure all elements are in place to complete the staining run. The specific automated staining procedure is performed for each slide, based on the protocol associated to the key code from the slide barcode.

# 3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Cervical punch biopsy specimens are collected by the clinician and placed in $10 \%$ neutral buffered formalin. Tissue sections are prepared from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cervical punch biopsy specimens and mounted on glass slides. Slides are placed on the VENTANA BenchMark ULTRA instrument for staining with the CINtec Histology device.

4. Calibration: Not applicable. See section titled Controls above.

5. Quality Control: See Controls in section IV.A above.

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility: i. Between-Lot precision

Three production lots of the recombinant CINtec $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Histology formulated with three independent recombinant anti-p16 antibody raw material lots were used in this study to stain each of the 26 cervical tissue cases (6 No CIN, 6 CIN1, 6 CIN2, 6 CIN3, and 2 cervical squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). These cases were qualified based on H&E staining. Eighteen sections were cut from each tissue block. For each lot, duplicate slides from each case were stained with H&E, CINtec $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Histology and a Negative Control (Monoclonal). The H&E stained slides were adjacent to the CINtec $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Histology slides. All CINtec $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Histology and Negative Control (Monoclonal) stained slides were run on the same BenchMark ULTRA instrument. Appropriate control tissue slides were also stained in each run.

Each CINtec $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Histology stained slide was than paired with its adjacent H&E and Negative Control (Monoclonal) slides. The order of the 26 slide sets was randomized. The sections stained with recombinant CINtec $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Histology were evaluated by a study pathologist for p16 staining intensities (0-4), p16 staining pattern (diffuse, focal, negative) and background (acceptable, unacceptable) and assigned a CINtec $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Histology status (positive, negative) according to scoring criteria described in the section titled “Interpretation of Results” above. Slide sets were also assessed for histological diagnosis (No CIN, CIN1, CIN2, CIN3 or invasive carcinoma) based on conjunctive evaluation of the H&E and recombinant CINtec $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Histology stained slides and assigned to CIN category $\mathrm { ( C I N } 2 \mathrm { + }$ vs. CIN1-). Agreement across lots based on CINtec $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Histology status (positive/negative) and by CIN status categories (CIN1-/CIN2+) were evaluated.

Acceptance Criteria: Stain intensity shall not vary more than 0.5 point from the median score on a 0-4 scale of each sample on greater than or equal to $8 5 \%$ between lots; all samples shall show equal to or higher than $90 \%$ positive/negative agreement for CINtec $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Histology status; the

antibody shall demonstrate background/cross-reactivity less than or equal to 0.5 points on a 0-4 scale in $90 \%$ or greater of the tissue samples stained.

# ii. Immunoreactivity

This study evaluated the immunoreactivity of recombinant CINtec Histology in various normal [Tour of Body (TOB)] and malignant tissues [Tour of Tumor (TOT)]. Additionally, the study evaluated if the positive and negative staining of these same tissue types with recombinant CINtec Histology was consistent with the staining of hybridoma CINtec Histology.

Background/cross-reactivity and morphology was also evaluated. The sections from TOB and TOT tissue microarrays and 20 additional individual cases were evaluated in this study. One section from each array or case was stained with recombinant CINtec Histology and hybridoma CINtec Histology and Negative Control (Monoclonal) on BenchMark ULTRA using OptiView DAB IHC detection kit. Furthermore, sections from one prequalified tonsil case were stained with hybridoma CINtec Histology and Negative Control (Monoclonal) were used as a run control. The stained slides were evaluated by pathologist for staining intensities (0-4), background and morphology (acceptable/ unacceptable).

Acceptance Criteria: Background/cross-reactivity less than or equal to 0.5 points on a 0-4 scale in $90 \%$ or greater of the tissue samples stained. The recommended staining protocol shall preserve tissue morphology as noted by the qualified reader in a minimum of $90 \%$ of interpretable samples stained.

The recombinant CINtec Histology and hybridoma CINtec Histology performed equivalently when used to stain a variety of normal and neoplastic tissue types. The tissues stained with hybridoma CINtec Histology exhibited same staining pattern as tissues stained with recombinant CINtec Histology.

2. Linearity: Not applicable   
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference: a. Western Blot

The primary objective of this study was to confirm the specificity of the recombinant anti$\mathsf { p } 1 6 ^ { \mathsf { N K } 4 \mathrm { a } }$ antibody to bind $\mathsf { p l } 6 ^ { \mathrm { I N K 4 a } }$ protein. In addition, the results from the Western blot assay using recombinant antibody were compared with the results using hybridoma Millipore anti$\mathsf { p } 1 6 ^ { \mathsf { I N K } 4 \mathrm { a } }$ (E6H4) antibody. The study also addressed the sensitivity of the recombinant antip16INK4a antibody by evaluating the lysates from cell lines expressing various amounts of p16INK4a protein.

One lot of recombinant anti-p16 antibody and one lot of hybridoma anti-p16 antibody were evaluated. Lysates from four cell lines with various expression levels of $\mathsf { p } 1 6 ^ { \mathrm { I N K 4 a } }$ protein and purified recombinant $\mathsf { p l } 6 ^ { \mathrm { I N K 4 a } }$ protein (positive control) and recombinant GADPH protein (negative control) were used in this study.

Acceptance Criteria: Single band between $1 5 { - } 2 0 \mathrm { k D a }$ $( { \sim } 1 6 \mathrm { k D a } )$ must be detected on the Western blot membrane for those lanes loaded with recombinant $\mathsf { p l } 6 ^ { \mathrm { I N K 4 a } }$ protein or with lysates from p16INK4a -expressing cell lines and consequently probed with recombinant anti- p16INK4a antibody or hybridoma anti- $\mathrm { p } 1 6 ^ { \mathrm { I N K 4 a } }$ antibody.

Both hybridoma and recombinant anti- $\mathsf { p l } 6 ^ { \mathrm { I N K 4 a } }$ (E6H4) antibody lots performed equivalently in the Western Blot assay demonstrating same sensitivity and specificity for $\mathrm { p } 1 6 ^ { \mathrm { I N K 4 a } }$ recombinant and endogenous protein, with no significant unexpected off target reactivity observed.

# b. Peptide Inhibition

The objective of this study is to confirm the specificity of CINtec® Histology formulated with the recombinant anti-p16 antibody for p16 protein in the context of the IHC assay.

One lot of the recombinant CINtec® Histology was used on a BenchMark ULTRA instrument for this study. The anti- $\mathtt { p l 6 } ^ { \mathrm { I N K 4 a } }$ (E6H4) antibody was pre-incubated at 1:1 dilution with three different concentrations $( 3 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { - 6 } \mathrm { M }$ , $3 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { - 7 } \mathrm { M }$ , and $3 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { - 8 } \mathrm { M } )$ of p16 INK4a epitope-specific peptides (AGGTRGSNHARIDAAEGPSDIDP, $\mathrm { M W } { = } 2 2 6 5 ~ \mathrm { g / m o l ) }$ . The non-specific peptide used in this study is These three concentrations were selected to span a range of molar ratios: approximately a 1000-fold, 100-fold, and 10-fold molar excess of peptide compared to the final concentration of anti-p16 antibody in the solution $( 3 . 3 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { - 9 } \mathrm { M } )$ . The primary antibody was also diluted 1:1 with three different concentrations $( 3 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { - 6 } \mathrm { M }$ , $3 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { - 7 } \mathrm { \bar { M } }$ , and $3 \mathrm { x } 1 0 ^ { - 8 } \mathrm { M } )$ ) of a non-specific peptide control [Alk-a (amino acid sequence: CWQHQPEDRPNFAIILERIEY), $\mathrm { M W } { = } 2 6 5 8 ~ \mathrm { g / m o l ] }$ .

CINtec® Histology/no peptide control solution CINtec® Histology reagent was diluted at a 1:1 ratio with the diluent only. All these solutions contained only $50 \%$ of the CINtec® Histology reagent. A multi-tissue block (MTB) containing one case of each CIN3, CIN1, and normal cervical epithelium was used in this study.

Duplicate MTB slides were stained with these prepared solutions and also with undiluted CINtec® Histology reagent. In addition, a single slide was stained with the negative reagent control [Negative Control (Monoclonal)]. All stained slides were scored for p16 staining intensity on a 0-4 scale for each tissue. Note: The p16 staining intensities determined for the cervical tissues stained with CINtec® Histology/no peptide control solution were used as a reference, since this solution contains the same amount of anti-p16 antibody as the solutions containing p16- specific or non-specific peptides ( $50 \%$ only).

Acceptance Criteria: Decreased staining in the tissues stained with recombinant CINtec Histology reagent containing p16 epitope-specific peptide when compared to the tissues stained with recombinant CINtec Histology reagent containing diluent or non-specific peptide.

This study confirmed the specificity of recombinant anti-p16 (E6H4) antibody in the context of the IHC assay. A nearly complete inhibition of the anti-p16 antibody binding to its target protein in tissues was detected when the p16 specific peptide was present in the recombinant CINtec $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Histology reagent and partial restoration of specific staining was observed when the p16 specific peptide concentration in recombinant CINtec $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Histology reagent was reduced. In contrast, no reduction in the signal intensities was observed when unrelated non-specific peptide was present in recombinant CINtec $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Histology reagent. No staining was detected when the tissues were stained with Negative Control (Monoclonal) or diluent only.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A method comparison study was performed to compare the performance of the CINtec Histology formulated with the recombinant anti-p16 antibody formulation and the CINtec Histology formulated with the hybridoma anti-p16 antibody (predicate device). The study was conducted using 249 cervical cases [114 No CIN, 17 CIN1, 53 CIN2, 51 CIN3, and 14 cervical SCC cases] run on one BenchMark ULTRA instrument. The cases (H&E stained slides) were reviewed and enrolled into the study by an experienced pathologist. Individual slides were stained with the recombinant CINtec Histology and hybridoma CINtec Histology device, randomized and evaluated for CINtec Histology status (positive/negative) by another pathologist (study pathologist) who was not involved in the selection of study cases.

Acceptance Criteria: Overall percent agreement (OPA) shall demonstrate a lower bound for the two-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence interval (LBCI) of greater than or equal to $8 5 \%$ . Background should be (less than or equal to 0.5 points (on a 0-4 scale) in $90 \%$ or greater of the tissue samples stained. Tissue morphology should be preserved as noted by the qualified reader in a minimum of $90 \%$ of interpretable samples stained.
