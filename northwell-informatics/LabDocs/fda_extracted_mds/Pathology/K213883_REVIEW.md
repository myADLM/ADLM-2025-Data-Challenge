# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner system is comprised of the NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner, the NZViewMD Software and the JVC Kenwood JD-C240BN01A display. It is an automated system for creating, viewing, and managing digital slides. Digital whole slide images (WSIs) of glass slides may be viewed, stored, retrieved, annotated, and/or shared, permitting the pathologist to make a primary diagnosis based on the review of the WSIs. The NanoZoomer system does not include any automated Image Analysis Applications that would constitute computer aided detection or diagnosis.

The NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner (Slide scanner) creates digital whole slide images (WSIs) of conventional histological glass slides containing FFPE tissue samples. The NanoZoomer slide scanner can be loaded with a maximum of 360 glass slides placed in 12 cassettes each with 30 standard-sized slides (length $7 5 . 0 { - } 7 6 . 5 \ \mathrm { m m }$ , width $2 4 . 7 \mathrm { - } 2 6 . 5 \ \mathrm { m m }$ , thickness $0 . 9 { - } 1 . 2 \ \mathrm { m m }$ ). Each cassette is manually loaded with slides by the operator, with the slide labels facing outward so they can still be read while the cassette is loaded into the scanner. Once the slide’s position is secured, the macro camera located directly above the slide first takes a picture of the slide’s barcode image as illuminated by an overhead LED, and then takes a macro image of the actual tissue trans-illuminated by a flat-panel LED underneath. The slide holder then moves to the micro imaging position for scanning. The system automatically detects areas where tissues are present and scans a single overall rectangular area containing all detected tissues. The scanning area is automatically determined using a macro image of the slide. The NanoZoomer System uses its motorized stage, $2 0 \mathrm { x }$ objective lens, CMOS camera and LED to detect appropriate focusing points and scan the identified areas of interest. A single micro camera acquires one square image at a time and the acquired images (tiles) are stitched together to make a single composite high-resolution image. Images are automatically saved to the hard disk during scanning and may be viewed later by using the included viewing software. The NZAcquireMD software organizes all WSI tiles into a single NDPI file. Each digital image covers an entire slide and typically contains billions of image pixels. The NZAcquireMD software allows the user to operate the scanner and to store and archive digital images.

Slides can be scanned in the non-batch mode and batch mode. In non-batch mode, a userspecified slide is brought onto the slide holder and the WSI (macro image) is displayed on the monitor. The user can draw rectangular windows manually with the mouse to specify areas to be scanned. The system then scans a single overall rectangular area that contains all user-specified scan areas.

The NZViewMD software is a software component intended to be used with the display monitor (JVC Kenwood JD-C240BN01A) and runs on a separate viewing workstation PC. The NZViewMD software opens the WSI images acquired with slide scanner from the image storage attached to local network and uses the color profile to render the image data to the calibrated display monitor to deliver the image view at the appropriate magnification. It has the following functionalities: continuous panning and zooming, comparing multiple slide images simultaneously in multiple windows, creating annotations during review using annotation tools, tracking of visited areas and annotations and digital bookmarks.

The display, a JVC Kenwood JD-C240BN01A allows the slide images to be viewed. The JVC Kenwood JD-C240BN01A features an IPS LCD color display with a display area of $5 1 8 . 4 \ \mathrm { m m } \times$ $3 2 4 . 0 \mathrm { m m }$ , a resolution of $1 , 9 2 0 \times 1 , 2 0 0$ pixels, and an aspect ratio of 16:10, illuminated by an edge LED backlight.

The NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner system can be connected to a server and a display monitor over a customer-provided local area network (LAN). The supporting networking hardware and software are also not part of the system and may be located in a central server room separately from the workstation, viewing software, and display monitor.

# B Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner system (NanoZoomer System)

2. Specimen Identification:

Glass slides and scanned images are identified based on the previously assigned specimen identifiers such as patient identifiers, barcodes, etc. Digital images of surgical pathology slides prepared from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue.

# 3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Specimen sampling and handling are performed upstream and independent of the use of the subject device. Specimen sampling includes surgical pathology specimens such as biopsy or

resection specimens which are processed using standard histology techniques. The FFPE tissue sections are H&E stained. Then digital images are obtained from these glass slides using the NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner.

# 4. Calibration:

When the system is launched (powered up), automatic system diagnosis is performed by the software using the provided calibration slides. This process evaluates the proper functioning of the light source, imaging sensor, and macro sensor and light source. When necessary, based on the automatic system diagnosis, adjustment of the shading correction and color balance correction features is performed automatically by the system. Monthly cleaning such as dusting of the scan mechanism and optical components is also performed by the user.

System administrators and field service personnel may also complete a system check following the NZAcquireMD Instructions for Use and the NZTuneMD service software and the calibration slides. This checks correction status and acquires correction data for whole slide and scanned images.

Additional calibration and quality control procedures are performed during field service visits following procedures provided in the NanoZoomer S360MD Maintenance Manual. These include annual testing of several critical components in the system and annual calibration of the components and the display.

# 5. Quality Control

Quality control (QC) activities are performed by the user. Prior to scanning slides using the NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner, the user conducts QC of the slides per the laboratory’s standards and professional guidelines (e.g., staining, cover-slipping, and barcode placement, etc.). After completing a scan, the user checks the image data and image quality using Quality Check (QC) mode in NZAcquireMD which includes the following steps:

Display the Scan Result screen by selecting a slide for which scanning has been completed. • Confirm scan area, focus quality, and barcode information. Confirm that the barcode information displayed above the slide image is consistent with the barcode label. Check the slide image to ensure all tissue on the slide are present within the scan area.

Manually verifying tissue block with the scanned images is also performed as needed. Slides are rescanned if necessary.

Before reading the scanned WSIs, the pathologist should ensure that all scanned slide images have been imported for every case and the images are of acceptable quality for diagnostic purposes. The pathologist reviews scanned images from all the slides associated with a case before rendering a diagnosis.

# VII Performance Characteristics:

# A Analytical Performance:

# a. Precision/ Reproducibility:

The objective of the study was to evaluate the repeatability (within- and between- scanner) and reproducibility (between-site) of the NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner system.

The precision of the device was based on the assessment and identification of specific histopathologic “features” that are observed in FFPE H&E stained slides. Each enrolled case consisted of a single slide containing an example of a single feature, called the primary feature, that had been selected by the enrolling pathologist (EP). Each slide was then verified by a verifying enrolling pathologist (VEP). A total of 30 different primary features from 540 cases from a single site were enrolled, 10 each at three different magnifications (10x, 20x, and 40x). Of these 30 features, 21 (7 per magnification level) were chosen to be "Study" features and 9 were chosen to be "Sham" features. Sham features were used to reduce the risk of reader recall bias but the primary study endpoint for the study was only assessed based on Study feature data for all sub-studies. Additional features at a given magnification, called secondary features, were allowed to be present on the slide and did not impact the eligibility of that slide to be included in the study. A total of 3 sites were used in this study. The Primary Features enrolled are summarized in Table 1 below.

# Study Inclusion Criteria:

Glass slides were screened for the known features and were considered eligible for the study only if all of the following criteria applied:

Slides are selected from cases in a consecutive manner starting with cases at least 1 year old since accessioning Slide is a glass H&E stained cover-slipped surgical pathology slide of human tissue

Slide has the designated primary feature in the FOV, which is readily observable in its natural environment although the slide may also have one or more secondary features from the same magnification group in the FOV   
Slide is not damaged, has tissue on the slide, and the staining is not faded and otherwise passes all quality checks

# Study Exclusion Criteria:

Slides were excluded from the study if any of the following criteria applied:

• Slide is unable to be scanned, contains damaged tissue or has indelible markings Slide comes from an active (less than 1 year old) case Slide is from a patient who already has a slide enrolled in the study, only 1 slide per patient to be enrolled

Slide scanning of the same set of enrolled slides was performed sequentially at all three study sites. Each slide was allowed to be scanned up to a total of five times (i.e., up to four rescans). Once the scanning was completed, the scanning technicians at each site created TIFF images from each of the original scanned WSIs. These TIFF images were called field-of-view (FOV) images because they represented the field of view that would be observed through a microscope at the appropriate magnification for the feature in question. The size of the TIFF images was standardized to be comparable to the amount of surface area seen at the magnification for the case in question. These FOV images (rather than entire WSIs) were the images read by the reading pathologists (RPs).

The scanning of the Study Sets was then further randomly assigned, depending on the sub-study, as described below:

Within-Scanner Sub-Study (Sub-Study 1, or SS1): Study slides were scanned three (3) times each on three (3) different scanners at one study site, resulting in nine (9) unique scans for each slide (3,402 total scans). The order in which each Set was scanned on each individual scanner was randomly assigned as was the order of scanners on which each Set was scanned. Between-Scanner Sub-Study (Sub-Study 2, or SS2): Study slides were scanned once on three (3) different scanners, resulting in three (3) unique scans for each slide (1,134 total scans). The order in which each Set was scanned on each individual scanner was randomly assigned. Between-Site Sub-Study (Sub-Study 3, or SS3): Study slides were scanned once on three (3) different scanners, which were at three (3) different study sites, resulting in three (3) unique scans for each slide (1,134 total scans). The order in which each Set was scanned was randomly assigned but was the same order for each site.

A total of nine (RP participated in the study, with three participating in each sub-study. Each RP participated in only one sub-study. Each RP reviewed a series of FOV images during each reading session, with at least 14 days wash out period between sessions. The study endpoints were as follows:

Positive and negative percentage agreements (PPA, NPA) between scans from the same scanner (intra-scanner precision) • Positive and negative percentage agreements between scans from different scanners at the same site (inter-scanner precision)

• Positive and negative percentage agreements between scans from different scanners at different sites (between-site precision)

# Within-Scanner Study:

Each RP read 432 FOVs (378 Study FOVs/54 Sham FOVs) in each of three (3) different reading Sessions for a total of 1,296 reads per RP. There were 3,888 total reads performed in the withinscanner sub-study. Excluding the sham FOV readings led to 3,402 pairwise comparisons between study FOVs. Agreement rates calculated from the cross-tabulation Table for the withinscanner sub-study are shown in Table 3 below:

Pathologists and Maintenance Engineers), uses and use environments. Overall, the results of the human factors testing are acceptable.

# D. Clinical Studies

A retrospective multi-center study was conducted to demonstrate that viewing, reviewing, and diagnosing digital images of surgical pathology FFPE tissue slides using the Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner system (“WSI”) is non-inferior to using conventional light microscopy (“glass”) under clinical use conditions. The study consisted of reviewing archived, de-identified and previously “signed-out” slides representing main organ systems within surgical pathology. Cases included retrospective H&E stained FFPE tissue, special stains and/or immunohistochemical stains (IHC) from the pathology practice, but did not include frozen sections, or cytological and hematological cases.

A total of 2,000 cases consisting of multiple organs and tissue types were enrolled in the study at four sites (500 cases per site) including difficult and challenging cases. At each site, four pathologists read all the cases assigned to their site using both WSI and glass methods in a randomized order and with a washout period of at least four weeks between readings, resulting in a total of 8,000 planned WSI reads and 8,000 planned glass reads. After the reader pathologist completed a primary diagnosis case report form (CRF) at a site, two pathologist adjudicators reviewed the study reader’s diagnosis and compared it with the original “signed out” diagnosis (reference) to determine concordance, minor discordance or major discordance between the study diagnosis (by WSI and glass methods) and original “signed out” diagnosis. A third pathologist adjudicator was used if disagreement occurred between the first two adjudicators on the classification of a “major” discordance. The original signed-out diagnosis is based on the original sign-out pathologic diagnosis rendered at the institutions using an optical (light) microscope. A major discordance was defined as a difference in diagnosis that would be associated with a clinically important difference in patient management. A minor discordance was defined as a difference in diagnosis that would not be associated with a clinically important difference in patient management.

The acceptance criteria were as follows:

The upper bound of the two-sided $9 5 \%$ CI of the difference between the overall major discordance rates of WSI diagnoses and Glass diagnoses is ${ \leq } 4 \%$ . The major discordance rate of the WSI diagnoses is $\leq 7 \%$ .

# Key Case and Slide Study Inclusion Criteria:

Cases were eligible to be included in the study only if all of the following criteria applied:

Cases originating from and that were diagnosed at that local site   
Cases are available in the site’s archive   
Cases are at least 1 year old since accessioning   
Cases are selected because their primary diagnosis is consistent with the assigned target categories as specified in the study protocol   
Cases have a set of slides representative of the primary diagnosis for which it has been selected.   
Slide is obtained by surgical pathology and prepared from FFPE human tissue   
Slides must be stained with H&E and accompanying special stains and/or IHC stains A chosen slide must demonstrate and be representative of the primary diagnosis; 1 H&E slide selection may suffice for biopsy cases,   
For resection cases, a minimum of 5 H&E slides must be selected, which represent the primary diagnosis. If represented with less than 5 H&E slides, additional H&E slides (primary, secondary, or benign slides) from same case may be used to fulfill minimum number   
Slide is intact, has correct size/thickness, good edges, undamaged coverslip, without pen markings that can’t be removed, no air bubbles, tidy labels, and fulfills the quality checks per the general clinical practice

# Key Case and Slide Study Exclusion Criteria:

Cases were excluded from the study if any of the following criteria applied:

Case does not have relevant slides or if case information necessary for the study is missing Case is still active (less than 1 year old) at the local site   
Cases for which the control slides for immunohistochemistry and special stains are not availab Two cases from same individual   
Gross-only cases that have no slides   
Cases that are frozen section, cytology or hematology or immunofluorescence specimens only   
Case where the only available set of slides have evidence only of secondary or no   
diagnoses and not the primary diagnosis for which the case is being screened.   
Glass slide that is broken, has abnormal size/thickness, beveled edges, poor coverslip (cracks, waviness, scratches), is sticky, has many pen markings or dirt that cannot be removed, contains air bubbles and overhanging labels that can’t be corrected, and if stain is severely faded.

Over all four sites, there were a total of 15,995 diagnoses (7,997 digital and 7,998 optical). The overall major discordance rate, as observed over all sites, reading pathologists and organs, was $3 . 5 \%$ for WSI and $3 . 1 \%$ for glass. The major discordance rates as estimated by a logistic model (mixed-model repeated-measures logistic regression) resulted in very similar, slightly lower proportions of $3 . 5 \%$ for WSI and $3 . 1 \%$ for glass. The WSI-glass difference in the major discordance rate was $0 . 4 \%$ , with a two-sided $9 5 \%$ Cl of $[ - 0 . 1 0 \% , 1 . 0 \% ]$ derived from a delta method approximation. The upper limit of this confidence interval was less than the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of $4 \%$ , therefore the WSI method using the Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner system is considered non-inferior to the glass method.

These results meet the two pre-specified acceptance criteria for the study. Specifically, the major discordance rate for the WSI modality, which was $3 . 5 \%$ , was required to be $< 7 . 0 \%$ and the upper limit of the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the difference in major discordance rate between the modalities (WSI-Glass), which was $1 . 0 \%$ , was required to be $< 4 . 0 \%$ .
