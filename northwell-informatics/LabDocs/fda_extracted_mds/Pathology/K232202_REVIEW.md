# A Device Description:

The Aperio GT 450 DX is a Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) system which includes the following components.

Aperio GT 450 DX digital slide scanner which includes the corresponding scanner configuration software, Aperio GT 450 Scanner Administration Manager DX (SAM DX)

• Viewing Workstation executing Aperio WebViewer DX image viewing software (version 1.0.0.5033)   
• Display

The Aperio GT $4 5 0 ~ \mathrm { D X }$ scanner is a semi-automated benchtop brightfield WSI scanner which includes the scanner configuration software and Aperio GT 450 Scanner Administration Manager DX (SAM DX) and is intended to scan surgical pathology glass slides prepared from FFPE tissue. The scanner supports continuous glass-slide loading of up to 15 racks with a total of 450-slide capacity, priority rack scanning, and automated image quality checks during image acquisition. The Aperio GT 450 DX scanner detects the racks once loaded in the scanner and automatically loads each slide in the batch to the stage and scans the glass slide to generate the WSI image. It can achieve a scan speed of 32 seconds at the $4 0 \mathrm { x }$ scanning magnification for a $1 5 \ \mathrm { m m } \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 5 \ \mathrm { m m }$ area. Users operate the scanner via a touchscreen interface.

The Aperio GT $4 5 0 ~ \mathrm { D X }$ scanner can save digital images in a unique Aperio ScanScope Virtual Slide (SVS) image format or Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) image format. SVS images displayed in Aperio WebViewer DX are compressed to $94 \%$ of the source SVS file, or JPEG $\mathrm { Q } = 9 4$ . After acquiring the scanned digital images, they are sent to end-userprovided image storage attached to the scanner’s local network, where they can be cataloged in image storage software including Image Management System (IMS), such as Aperio eSlide Manager or a Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS).

Aperio GT 450 SAM DX is centralized scanner management software external to the connected scanner(s). This software application enables configuration, monitoring, and service access of multiple scanners from a single desktop client location. Aperio GT 450 SAM DX is installed on a customer-provided server that resides on the same network as the scanner(s) for image management.

The Aperio WebViewer DX image viewing software is a web-based image viewer that enables users to perform quality control of images and to review and annotate digital images acquired from the Aperio GT450 DX scanner for pathology primary diagnosis. The Aperio WebViewer DX also incorporates monitor display image validation checks, which provide the user with the ability to ensure the digital slide images are displayed as intended on their monitor, and that browser updates have not inadvertently affected the image display quality. Aperio WebViewer DX is installed on a server and accessed from an IMS (e.g., Aperio eSlide Manager) or a customer’s Laboratory Information System (LIS) using compatible browsers.

The display allows the slide images to be viewed. The interoperable displays are thin-film transistor, in-plane switching (TFT), color liquid crystal displays (TFT-LCD/IPS) calibrated to the sRGB color space. Their specifications are listed in Table 8 below.

# Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: Aperio GT 450 DX

2. Specimen Identification:

Glass slides and scanned images are identified based on the previously assigned specimen identifiers such as patient identifiers, barcodes, etc. Digital images of surgical pathology slides prepared from FFPE tissue.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Specimen sampling and handling are performed upstream and independent of the use of the subject device. Specimen sampling includes surgical pathology specimens such as biopsy or resection specimens which are processed using standard histology techniques. The FFPE tissue sections are stained using the Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining procedure. Then digital images are obtained from these glass slides using the Aperio GT $4 5 0 \mathrm { D X }$ scanner.

# 4. Calibration:

The Aperio GT 450 DX scanner performs essential image calibrations at the time the scanner is powered on. No additional calibration is needed for regular use. There is no calibration for Aperio GT 450 DX software.

5. Quality Control:

Quality control (QC) activities are performed by the user per the laboratory standards and professional guidelines (e.g., staining, cover-slipping, barcode placement) prior to loading the slides into the Aperio GT 450 DX scanner. After completing a scan, the lab technician checks image data and image quality as per the instructions for use. Before review, the pathologist performs quality control on the WSI images of the slide per instructions for use.

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility:

The objective of this study was to evaluate the repeatability (within- and between- system) and reproducibility (between-site) of the Aperio GT 450 DX.

The precision of the device was based on 5 reading pathologists’ assessments and identification of specific histopathologic “features” that are observed in FFPE H&E stained slides. Twentythree (23) primary features were selected for the analytical studies. The selected primary features were evaluated at their relevant magnifications -12 primary features evaluated at $2 0 \mathrm { x }$ magnification level and 11 primary features evaluated at $4 0 \mathrm { x }$ magnification level.

The Precision Panel Slide Curator (curator) identified study slides by conducting a Lab Information System (LIS) search and reviewing the microscope slides from consecutive cases that potentially contain the study features (Table 1). A representative H&E stained slide or a recut slide containing the feature(s) of interest was obtained from each case. After the curator selected and marked the study features on the slides, the slides were scanned at magnification levels designated to the study features, either $2 0 \mathrm { x }$ or $4 0 \mathrm { x }$ magnification. The curator reviewed the glass slides through the microscope while reviewing the WSI images on the monitor to extract Field of Views (FOVs) containing the study features from the WSI images using a lossless compression type. For each subsequent WSI images of the same slide, the annotations were manually replicated by a technician using the image viewing software to extract and randomly rotate the FOVs by 90, 180 or 270 degrees to minimize recall bias. A trained study personnel verified the FOV filenames and also that the FOV extraction areas were correct and enrolled the FOVs in the study. During precision study, the extracted FOV images were restricted for both the area of tissue visible to the reading pathologists and for the viewing magnification. The reading pathologists were not allowed to navigate the WSI image or change magnification or get access to any clinical information associated with the study slides. Additional slides that may or may not include any of the study features were included as “wild card” slides to reduce recall

bias. The “wild card” FOVs were extracted by following the same procedures as the study FOVs. As shown in Table 1, each primary study feature was represented in 3 FFPE sections of different organ types. From each slide, 2 or 3 FOVs containing either one primary study feature, or a primary study feature and secondary study feature(s) in each FOV were selected. A total of 202 FOVs were selected from 69 glass slides. Out of 202 FOVs, 46 FOVs (from 24 slides) contained multiple histologic features and 156 FOVs (from 62 slides) contained one primary histologic feature. In addition, 36 wild card FOVs were selected from 12 glass slides. There was a minimum washout period of 14 days between pathologist reading sessions.

The precision of the Aperio GT $4 5 0 \mathrm { D X }$ was assessed in 3 sub-studies:

• Within-system precision was assessed using 3 independent systems. Overall withinsystem precision was also assessed.   
• Between-system/site precision, was assessed 3 independent systems at 3 different sites. Overall between systems/sites precision was also assessed. Within- and between-pathologist precision was assessed using images generated from a single system. Overall within-pathologists and overall between-pathologists precision were also assessed.

The precision was considered acceptable if the lower bounds of the 2-sided $9 5 \%$ confidence interval (CI) of the overall agreements for each precision component (within-system, between-system/site, within-pathologist, and between-pathologist) were $\ge 8 5 \%$

# Within-System Precision

This study evaluated the agreement between the 3 scans from the same system/site. The panel of 69 study slides was split equally among the three (3) sites (i.e., each site scanned a separate subset of slides). Each site has a single scanning system. For each system, 23 slides were scanned once on each of three (3) days, producing three (3) sets of scans for each slide. FOVs were extracted from scanned WSI images. The FOVs from three scanning sessions were evaluated by one reading pathologist over three different reading sessions with at least a twoweek washout period in between the reading sessions. In each reading session, the reading pathologist evaluated all 202 study FOVs from each of three scanning sessions (across three scanning systems), plus unique “wild card” FOVs to assist in preventing recall bias between reading sessions.

For each system, agreements between scan 1 versus scan 2, scan 1 versus scan 3 and scan 2 versus scan 3 were analyzed. The overall within-system precision was based on the pooled data of all three systems. A bootstrap approach was used to calculate $9 5 \%$ Confidence Intervals (CIs).

# Between-System/Between-Site Precision

At each of three study sites, a study technician scanned the entire set of 69 study slides once. FOVs from three scanning sessions (resulting from one session from each of the three sites) were extracted. From all the scanning systems, 606 FOVs were transferred to a single reading pathologist for evaluation in three separate reading sessions. In each reading session, the reading pathologist evaluated all 202 study FOVs from a single site, plus unique “wild card” FOVs to assist in preventing recall bias between reading sessions. Agreements between systems at Site 1 versus Site 2, systems at Site 1 versus Site 3 and systems at Site 2 versus Site 3 were analyzed. The overall inter-system/inter-site precision is based on the pooled data from each system-tosystem comparison. A bootstrap approach was used to calculate $9 5 \%$ CIs.

# Within-Site/Within-Pathologist and Between-Pathologist Precision

The entire set of 69 slides were scanned once at one site. FOVs were extracted and saved in three different orientations. From all the orientations, 606 FOVs were presented to each of three reading pathologists for evaluation in three reading sessions. In each reading session, each reading pathologist evaluated all 202 study FOVs plus unique “wild card” FOVs to assist in preventing recall bias between reading sessions. For within-pathologist precision, agreements between FOVs in orientation 1 versus orientation 2, orientation 1versus orientation 3, and orientation 2 versus orientation 3 were analyzed for each reading pathologist.

C. Clinical studies:

A multi-center study was conducted to demonstrate that viewing, reviewing, and diagnosing digital images of surgical pathology FFPE tissue slides using the Aperio GT 450 DX System is non-inferior to using optical (light) microscopy. The primary endpoint was the difference in major discordance rates between WSI review modality (WSIR) and microscope slide review modality (MSR) when compared to the reference (main) diagnosis, which is based on the original sign-out pathologic diagnosis rendered at the institutions, using an optical (light) microscope. The study cases were selected from the previous Aperio AT2 DX System clinical study (K190332). In order to ensure cases met the selection criteria and that selected slides were representative of the primary diagnosis the case curation process and the study inclusion and exclusion criteria in the previous study were as follows: The case curation pathologist reviewed the sign-out diagnosis and supporting documentation available at the time of the diagnosis (i.e., pathology report). By reviewing the microscopic slides used to make the signout diagnosis, the slide(s) that were representative of the sign-out diagnosis for the case were identified. The selected slides included H&E, immunohistochemistry (IHC), special stains and any slides that were not critical to diagnosis but supported the final surgical pathology report (e.g., margins, lymph node status, vascular and neural invasion), and any slides representing required elements of the College of American Pathologists (CAP) applicable cancer protocols. In the case of IHCs and special stains, the inclusion of control slides was required to fulfill the quality checks according to general clinical practice. The site’s curation verification pathologist verified that the selected slide(s) reflected the main diagnosis for the case as well as the required ancillary information for cancer cases met all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria stated below before the case was enrolled in the study.

# Inclusion criteria:

All glass slides with human tissue obtained via surgical pathology of the original case were available.   
The original sign-out diagnosis and ancillary supporting information were available. The selected slide(s) for the main diagnosis and the control slide(s) (e.g., controls for IHC stained slides) matched the study requested organ type and fulfilled the quality checks according to general clinical practice.   
For cases with multiple diagnoses in a single sign-out pathology report, only the main diagnosis and ancillary information were included.

# Exclusion criteria:

H&E stained slides that were used for the original sign-out diagnosis were not   
available at the site and re-cuts were not available.   
If applicable, the IHC or special stain slides that were used for the original sign out diagnosis were not available at the site or had unacceptable artifacts. Control slides for IHC or special stain were not available.   
Cases for which slides needed to support the original sign-out diagnosis required either a special light source (e.g., a mercury lamp for fluorescence microscopy) or special filters (e.g., for polarized light).   
Cases with slides containing unremovable markings or were damaged.   
Cases that contained frozen sections or gross specimens only.   
Cases that were missing significant clinical and ancillary information that was available at the time the case was originally interpreted (e.g., X-rays).   
Cases that were signed out less than one year prior to the date of curation.   
Only one case could be enrolled per patient.

A total of 1161 cases were selected to be enrolled in the current study and included a diverse mixture of pathologic diagnoses and tissue/organ types. There was a total of 3 study sites.

At each site of the 3 study sites, technician(s) scanned slides from cases identified at their sites using the Aperio GT $4 5 0 \mathrm { D X }$ . Each reading pathologist at each site (3 pathologists at each of sites 1 and 2 and 4 pathologists at Site 3) evaluated all study cases from their site using the Aperio GT $4 5 0 \mathrm { D X }$ , as well as the case ancillary information to determine WSIR diagnosis. For each reading pathologist, approximately $50 \%$ of cases were reviewed from the site’s local server (local access) and approximately $50 \%$ of cases were reviewed from the LBS image web hosting site (remote access). If the WSIR diagnosis could not be determined, the reading pathologist could defer the diagnosis. The reason(s) for deferring a diagnosis was documented.

There was a total of 3709 case reads performed by WSIR: (Site 1: 399 cases $\times 3$ pathologists) $^ +$ (Site 2: 500 cases $\times 3$ pathologists) $^ +$ (Site $3 \colon 2 5 3 \times 4$ pathologists). There were 1883 case reads (1883/3709, $5 0 . 8 \%$ ) performed at the local viewing station (local cohort) and 1826 number of cases reads (1826/3709, $4 9 . 2 \%$ ) performed at the remote viewing station (remote cohort). For MSR diagnosis, the consensus scores generated during the previous Aperio AT2 DX System clinical study (K190332) were used for this study to estimate MSR diagnosis major discordance rate.

A minimum of 2 adjudication pathologists (also known as adjudicators) independently assessed concordance (concordant, minor discordance, major discordance) of the WSIR diagnosis against the sign-out diagnosis (reference diagnosis) using predefined rules. A major discordance was defined as a difference in diagnosis that resulted in a clinically important difference in patient management, while a minor discordance would not be associated with a clinically important difference in patient management. The concordance score for the same case between the 2 adjudicators were compared to determine a consensus score for major discordance status. If consensus was not reached between the first 2 adjudicators, a third adjudicator reviewed the study diagnosis against the reference diagnosis. If consensus between 2 of 3 adjudicators was still not reached, then the 3 adjudicators convened as a panel to come to a consensus for the major discordant status. WSIR diagnosis consensus scores were used to estimate WSIR diagnosis major discordant rate.

Major discordance rates were estimated for WSIR diagnosis and MSR diagnosis (relative to the reference diagnosis), as well as the difference in overall major discordance rates between the 2 modalities. For the primary objective of demonstrating the WSIR major discordance rate to be non-inferior to the MSR major discordance rate, a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLIMMIX) logistic regression was conducted. For each reading result the dependent variable was the major discordance status and independent variables included modality as a fixed effect (WSIR vs. MSR) and site, reader, and case as random effects. A two-sided $9 5 \%$ CI for the modality effect, i.e., the overall major discordance rate difference (WSIR minus MSR), was constructed from this analysis. If the upper bound of the $9 5 \%$ CI was less than the non-inferiority margin of $4 \%$ , WSIR would be considered non-inferior to MSR shows the overall major discordance rates of the full cohort for both modalities (relative to the reference diagnosis) based on observed results and by the generalized linear model.

Thirty-six (36) WSIR case reads from 1 pathologist at Site 2 were excluded due to incorrectly assigned diagnoses (14 case reads from the local cohort and 22 case reads from the remote cohort). One case read (remote cohort) from 1 pathologist at Site 2 was excluded from both modalities due to an absence of MSR data from previous Aperio AT2 DX System Accuracy Study. Therefore, 3672 and 3708 cases read were performed by WSIR (local cohort: 1869 case reads; remote cohort: 1803 case reads) and MSR, respectively.

Excluding the 122 ( $3 . 3 \%$ , 122/3672) WSIR and 77 $( 2 . 1 \%$ , 77/3708) MSR deferred diagnoses (cases for which no study diagnoses was assigned and were not sent for adjudication), 3550 WSIR and 3631 MSR diagnoses were generated by the reading pathologists and sent for adjudication. Of the 122 WSIR deferred diagnoses, 62 (62/122, $5 0 . 1 \% )$ were from the local cohort and 60 (60/122, $4 9 . 2 \% )$ were from the remote cohort, resulting in 1807 and 1743 diagnoses for the local and remote cohorts, respectively. Note: MSR diagnoses were generated during the previous Aperio AT2 DX System clinical study (K190332).

One WSIR diagnosis (local cohort) was deferred by the adjudicators. Therefore, 3549 WSIR diagnoses were included in the statistical analyses (1806 from the local cohort and 1743 from the remote cohort). For MSR, 3631 diagnoses had consensus scores (from the previous Aperio AT2 DX System clinical study) and were included in the statistical analyses. analyses.

# Study Results

The overall observed major discordance rate for WSIR diagnosis was $6 . 1 4 \%$ (218/3549) and for MSR diagnosis was $3 . 6 6 \%$ (133/3631). The overall major discordance rates estimated by the generalized linear model were $5 . 8 4 \%$ ( $9 5 \%$ CI: $5 . 0 1 \%$ to $6 . 8 0 \%$ ) for the WSIR diagnosis and $3 . 4 4 \%$ ( $9 5 \%$ CI: 2.84 to $4 . 1 7 \%$ ) for the MSR diagnosis. The estimated difference in major discordance rates (WSIR diagnosis minus MSR diagnosis) was $2 . 4 0 \%$ ( $9 5 \%$ CI: $1 . 4 0 \%$ to $3 . 3 9 \%$ . The upper bound of the $9 5 \%$ CI of the estimated difference in major discordance rates was $3 . 3 9 \%$ which met the predefined acceptance criteria of $\leq 4 \%$ .

The secondary endpoint was to demonstrate that the overall major discordant rate between the WSIR diagnosis and the reference diagnosis did not exceed $7 \%$ ; the upper bound of the $9 5 \%$ CI for the overall major discordant rate of WSIR diagnosis was $6 . 8 0 \%$ , which met the predefined acceptance criteria of $\leq 7 \%$ . Thus, the study met the primary objective. Study results are shown in the table below.

The observed estimates for the major discordance rates for the WSIR and MSR diagnoses (relative to the reference diagnosis) and the difference between the two modalities (WSIR major discordance rate minus MSR major discordance rate) for each organ for the full cohort, local cohort and remote cohort are as follows: Three (3) organ types (appendix, gallbladder, and hernial/peritoneal) had observed major discordance rates of $0 . 0 0 \%$ for both modalities in the full cohort. For the local cohort, there were an additional 2 organ types [kidney (neoplastic) and salivary gland] that had major discordance rates of $0 . 0 0 \%$ for both modalities. Excluding these organs from the respective cohorts, the difference in major discordance rates (WSIR diagnosis minus MSR diagnosis) ranged from $- 3 . 1 3 \%$ (brain/neuro) to $7 . 7 0 \%$ (skin) for the full cohort, - $6 . 5 2 \%$ (brain/neuro) to $8 . 8 8 \%$ (skin) for the local cohort and $- 3 . 4 9 \%$ (GE junction) to $9 . 3 8 \%$ (liver/BD) for the remote cohort. The clinical study was not powered to analyze results by individual organ site or diagnosis. The performance of Aperio GT $4 5 0 \mathrm { D X }$ was determined by the overall difference in major discordance rate between WSIR and MSR.

# E. Human Factor Study:

Human factors studies for Aperio GT $4 5 0 \mathrm { D X }$ were conducted. The studies were designed around critical user tasks and use scenarios performed by representative users from histotechnicians and pathologists. The information included a list of all critical user tasks and a description of the process used to identify them. A systematic evaluation involving simulated use by representative users performing all tasks (including critical tasks) required for the operation of the device and a subjective assessment of failure was provided. All participants were able to perform all tasks (including the critical tasks) and no critical task failures were observed. There were several occasional difficulties, which was attributed to non-familiarity associated with first-time use of the new software and instrument. The learnability and ease of use were acceptable and there were no difficulties or failures observed on tasks that could lead to patient harm. In all instances, both pathologists and histotechnicians were able to identify cases and ensure that the case presentation was complete in the user interface.
