# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

HALO AP Dx, version 2.1 is a browser-based software-only device intended to aid pathology professionals in viewing, manipulating, management, and interpretation of digital pathology whole slide images (WSI) of glass slides obtained from the Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. NanoZoomer S360MD scanner and viewed on the JVC Kenwood JD-C240BN01A display.

HALO AP Dx is operated as follows:

1. Image acquisition is performed using the predicate device, NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner according to its Instructions for Use. The operator performs quality control of the digital slides per the instructions of the NanoZoomer and lab specifications to determine if re-scans are necessary.   
2. Once image acquisition is complete, the unaltered image is saved in an external image storage location. HALO AP Dx ingests the image and a copy of image metadata is stored in the subject device’s database to improve viewing response times.   
3. Scanned images are reviewed by scanning personnel such as histotechnicians to confirm image quality and initiate any re-scans before making it available to the pathologist.   
4. The reading pathologist selects a patient case from a selected worklist within HALO AP Dx whereby the subject device fetches the associated images from external image storage.   
5. The reading pathologist uses the subject device to view the images and can perform the following actions, as needed: a. Zoom and pan the image. b. Measure distances and areas in the image. c. Annotate images. d. View multiple images side by side in a synchronized fashion.

6. The above steps are repeated as necessary.

After viewing all images belonging to a particular case (patient), the pathologist will make a diagnosis which is documented in another system, such as a Laboratory Information System (LIS).

The interoperable components of HALO AP Dx and other system specifications are provided in tables 1 – 4 below.

# B Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: HALO AP Dx

2. Specimen Identification:

HALO AP Dx uses digital pathology images obtained from the Hamamatsu S360 MD scanner of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained glass slides. The reading pathologist selects a case (patient) from a worklist (within the device or external to the device) whereby the subject device fetches the associated images from the external image storage. The scanned images are identified based on the previously assigned specimen identifier such as the laboratory specimen accession number.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Specimen sampling and handling are performed upstream and independent of the use of the subject device. Specimen sampling includes biopsy or resection specimens which are processed using histology techniques. The FFPE tissue section is Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained. Digital images are then obtained from these glass slides using the Hamamatsu S360 MD scanner.

4. Calibration: Not applicable

5. Quality Control:

The scanning technician should perform quality control of all glass slides following the instructions. Upon scanning, quality control should be performed on all digital slide images following procedures defined by the scanner manufacturer prior to import into HALO AP Dx.

The pathologist should review all images to ensure that all expected slides have been imported by viewing the thumbnails and labels, and manually verifying the tissue specimen, block, and staining information is present. Additional details of the quality control procedures are provided in the device User’s Guide and the Implementation Guide.

# B Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:

Technical performance testing was conducted with HALO AP Dx. The subject device was compared to the predicate device’s image review manipulation software (IRMS, as defined in FDA guidance document, “Guidance for Industry – Technical Performance Assessment of Digital Pathology Whole Slide Imaging Devices,” dated April 20, 2016) using the quantitative pixel-wise comparison method. The basis for the comparison was the CIEDE2000 color difference equation, ΔE.

# 1. Bench Testing - Pixelwise comparison test

Pixel-wise comparison testing to demonstrate identical image reproduction was conducted to compare WSIs reproduced by HALO AP Dx and Nanozoomer NZViewMD. The devices were tested as operating with the intended components, including the scanner (Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner), image management system (Nanozoomer NZViewMD, HALO AP Dx with Google Chrome, or HALO AP Dx with Microsoft Edge), and display (JVC Kenwood JD-C240BN01A).

The device was tested with multiple slides across multiple regions of interest (ROI) at multiple magnification levels. A total of 35 H&E-stained, FFPE glass slides of normal and tumor tissues from various human anatomical organs were used in the testing. The glass slides were scanned on a Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner system to obtain 35 WSIs. For each of the 35 WSIs, 3 ROIs were selected by qualified personnel to represent various features in the tissue samples. Each ROI was captured at 3 magnification levels (10x, 20x, 40x).

The screenshots were captured from the intended display and cropped to generate bitmap images (.bmp) that were ready for pixelwise comparison. Three sets of images were collected: (1) NZViewMD, (2) HALO AP Dx using Google Chrome, and (3) HALO AP Dx using Microsoft Edge. Each image set included 315 images that covered all combinations of 35 slides, 3 ROIs, and 3 magnification levels. The testing data, including the overview images of the 35 glass slides with annotations of the ROIs, registration/cropping information, and captured images, were provided in the FDA specific format.

Image set #1 above was used as the reference to compare image set #2 (or #3) to determine whether all the 315 image-pairs were identical. Two images are considered identical if the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of the pixelwise differences, computed using the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) color difference metric CIEDE2000 $\left( \Delta \mathrm { E } _ { 0 0 } \right)$ , is less than $3 ~ \Delta \mathrm { E } _ { 0 0 }$ . Testing results showed that the pixelwise differences across all 630 image-pairs were less than 3 $\Delta \mathrm { E } _ { 0 0 }$ . The mean 95th percentile $\Delta \mathrm { E } _ { 0 0 }$ value was 1.52 with the lowest value reported as 0.82 and the highest reported as 2.75. Testing results demonstrated that WSIs reproduced by HALO AP Dx are identical to images reproduced by the predicate device.

# 2. Turnaround Time

Turnaround times for image loading, panning and zooming were tested when using Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers over different magnifications levels and over multiple fields of view (FOVs). Additionally, concurrent, multi-user load testing of the HALO AP Dx Image Server was performed to show that the subject device is responsive under constant utilization over a long period of time. Test results showed these to be adequate for the intended use of the subject device.

# 3. Measurements – area and distance

Measurement accuracy testing was performed to demonstrate that HALO AP Dx represents length and area measurements accurately across multiple magnification levels. An image of a calibration slide with known object sizes was used to verify the measurement accuracy. A total of 32 annotations were created – 4 annotations (2 horizontal and 2 vertical) at 4 magnification levels in 2 browsers. The intended and reported metrics were recorded for each annotation. The differences between intended and reported measurements were calculated. Test results showed that the subject device performed accurate measurements of length and area across multiple magnification settings with respect to its intended use.

# 4. Human Factors (Usability) Testing

Usability testing was conducted per FDA’s Guidance on Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineering to Medical Devices (2016). A summative human factors test, designed around critical user tasks and use scenarios using multiple representative users (pathologists and histotechnicians), was conducted. All tasks associated with reviewing and reporting results for cases including confirmation that all slides belonging to specific cases are reviewed before reporting results were included in the study. The HALO AP Dx device has been found to be safe and effective for intended users, users and use environments.
