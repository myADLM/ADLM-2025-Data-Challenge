# B Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:

Technical performance testing was conducted with the subject device, MetaLite DX Digital Pathology Software as specified below.

# 1. Bench Testing - Pixelwise comparison test

Pixel-wise comparison testing to demonstrate identical image reproduction was conducted to compare WSIs reproduced by the subject device and PIPS IMS. The subject device was compared to the predicate device’s image review manipulation software (IRMS, as defined in FDA guidance document, “Technical Performance Assessment of Digital Pathology Whole Slide Imaging Devices” dated April 20, 2016) using the quantitative pixel-wise comparison method. The basis for the comparison was the CIEDE2000 color difference equation, $\Delta \mathrm { E }$ . The devices were tested as operating with the intended components, including the scanner (PIPS UFS), image management system (PIPS IMS, MetaLite DX Digital Pathology Software) and display (Barco MDPC 8127).

The device was tested with multiple slides across multiple regions of interest (ROI) at multiple magnification levels. A total of 30 H&E-stained, FFPE glass slides of normal and tumor tissues from various human anatomical organs were used in the testing. The glass slides were scanned on a PIPS UFS version 1.8.4 to obtain 30 WSIs. For each of the 30

WSIs, 3 ROIs from different locations were selected by qualified personnel to represent various features in the tissue samples. Each ROI was captured at 2 magnification levels (20x, 40x).

The screenshots were captured from the intended display while viewing with the subject device and predicate PIPS IMS. The screenshots were cropped and registered to be pixelwise comparable. The cropped image included most of the pixels in the image except for those in the viewer-specific user interface areas.

Two sets of images were collected: PIPS IMS and MetaLite DX Digital Pathology Software. Each image set included 180 images that covered all combinations of 30 slides, 3 ROIs and 2 magnification levels. The testing data, including the overview images of the 30 glass slides with annotations of the ROIs, registration/cropping information, and captured images, were provided in the FDA specific format.

The PIPS IMS image set was used as the reference to compare the MetaLite DX Digital Pathology Software image set to determine whether all the 180 image-pairs were identical. Two images are considered identical if the 95th percentile of the pixelwise differences, computed using the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) color difference metric CIEDE2000 $\left( \Delta \mathrm { E } _ { 0 0 } \right)$ , is less than $3 ~ \Delta \mathrm { E } _ { 0 0 }$ . Testing results showed that the pixelwise differences across all 180 image-pairs were less than $3 ~ \Delta \mathrm { E } _ { 0 0 }$ . The mean 95th percentile $\Delta \mathrm { E } _ { 0 0 }$ value was 1.1 with the lowest value reported as 0 and the highest reported as 2.5. Testing results demonstrated that WSIs reproduced by MetaLite DX Digital Pathology Software are identical to images reproduced by the predicate device.

# 2. Turnaround Time

The turnaround times of the subject device were measured for the operations of image opening, panning, and zooming. Video recording software and calibration time software were used in the test to determine the turnaround time. The panning operation was executed by moving the image by one quarter of the screen using mouse dragging. The zooming operation was executed using the mouse wheel. Each operation was measured 10 times. The acceptance criterion was set at 7 seconds with respect to the device’s intended use. Test results show that all opening, panning, and zooming operations were completed within 5 seconds.

# 3. Measurement

The measurement accuracy of the subject device was tested. A calibration scale slide with length marks of 100, 300, 600, 800, and $1 0 0 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ was used as the target with known ground truth. The scale was measured in both horizontal and vertical orientations using the subject device. The error was calculated as the ratio of the difference between the measured length and the actual length to the actual length. The acceptance criterion was set at $5 \%$ with respect to the device’s intended use. The test was conducted under magnification levels of 40X, 20X, 10X, and 1X. Test results show that the errors of all test cases were less than $2 . 4 \%$ .

# 4. Human Factor (Usability) Testing

The Human Factors (HF) validation test was conducted to demonstrate that the device can be used by the intended users without serious use errors or problems, for the intended uses and under the expected use conditions. The HF validation test was performed by representative users and conducted per FDA’s Guidance on Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineering to Medical Devices (2016). A systematic evaluation of task-based usability including critical tasks required for operation of the device were evaluated at multiple sites using multiple users. All tasks associated with reviewing and reporting results for cases including confirmation that all slides belonging to specific cases are reviewed before reporting results, were included in the HF validation test. Overall, the results of the human factors testing were acceptable. The MetaLite DX Digital Pathology Software device has been found to be safe and effective for intended users, users and use environments.
