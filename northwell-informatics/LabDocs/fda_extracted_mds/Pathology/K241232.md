# II Summary of Technological Characteristics:

The Galen Second Read is an in vitro diagnostic medical device software, derived from a deterministic deep convolutional neural network that has been developed with digitized WSIs of H&E-stained prostate core needle biopsy (PCNB) slides originating from formalin-fixed paraffinembedded (FFPE) tissue sections, that were initially diagnosed as benign by the pathologist.

The Galen Second Read is cloud-hosted and utilizes external accessories [e.g., scanner and image management systems (IMS)] for automatic ingestion of the input. The device identifies WSIs that are more likely to contain prostatic adenocarcinoma (AdC). For each input WSI, the Galen Second Read automatically analyzes the WSI and outputs the following:

Binary classification of the likelihood (high/low) to contain AdC based on a predetermined threshold of the neural network output. For slides classified with high likelihood to contain AdC, slide-level findings are flagged and visualized (AdC score and heatmap) for additional review by a pathologist alongside the WSI. • For slides classified as low likelihood to contain AdC, no additional output is available.

Galen Second Read key functionalities include image upload and analysis, flag slides of high likelihood to contain AdC and display of all the WSIs uploaded to the system alongside their analysis results. Flagged findings constitute a recommendation for additional review by a pathologist.

Galen Second Read is operated as follows:

1. Scanned digital images of PCNB are acquired using the designated digital pathology scanner (Philips IntelliSite Pathology Solution (PIPS) Ultra Fast Scanner (UFS)). Image and other related quality control steps are performed per the scanner instructions for use and any additional user site specifications. Upon availability of the WSI file, the scanned digital images are automatically processed (unless contraindicated) by the Galen Second Read in the background.

2. For every slide, the Galen Second Read’s algorithm calculates and outputs a tissue ratio (a measure of the amount of tissue in the image), an out-of-focus ratio (a measure of the amount of blurry tissue in the image), and in case both are within predetermined ranges, it also outputs slide-level AdC score (likelihood to contain AdC), and an associated AdC heatmap.

3. Galen Second Read is used for all slides from cases with pathologist’s initial benign diagnosis. In case the slide was found by the Galen Second Read to be with high likelihood to contain AdC, the device flags for additional review by the pathologist.

4. All flagged findings are available in the Galen Second Read and the pathologist can select a patient case and open each flagged WSI for an additional review. The available information for review includes AdC score (the likelihood to contain AdC) and AdC heatmap marking the region suggestive to include cancer. The heatmap opacity can be controlled and toggled on/off to allow unobstructed reexamination. The AdC likelihood and the associated heatmap are indicative for AdC. The diagnosis may be documented in another system, e.g., a Laboratory Information System (LIS).

5. A resolution by the reviewing pathologist can be either of the following options: confirm the Galen Second Read result (alter the initial diagnosis from benign to malignant), reject the Galen Second Read result (no additional action is required) or decide that more information is needed to support diagnosis, based on pathology laboratory best practices, outside of the Galen Second Read device.

The final determination of diagnosis is made by the pathologist based on the histologic findings and/or additional tests and should not be solely based on the Galen Second Read output. The flagged findings constitute a recommendation for a second pathologist review. Pathologists should follow the SoC to obtain additional information, if needed, to render a final diagnosis.

Galen Second Read, has similar indications for use and intended use as the predicate device. The technological characteristics differences do not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness. Thus, the Galen Second Read is substantially equivalent.

# IV Summary of Performance Validation:

# A. Analytical Performance:

Precision and localization studies were performed to assess the Galen Second Read precision (repeatability and reproducibility) in identifying WSI of PCNBs suspicious of cancer, its localization accuracy and its localization precision of detecting the pixels that belong to cancer foci in WSIs from PCNBs of adult male subjects. The slides were retrospectively collected, de-identified and scanned by different PIPS UFS scanners and operators. Slides were processed by Galen Second Read, and results for the slides were either positive or negative. The study has demonstrated that the Galen Second Read identification of WSI of PCNBs suspicious of cancer, is precise (repeatable and reproducible, as demonstrated for within-scanner/operator (Table 3) and betweenscanner/operator (Table 4). Localization accuracy and precision was demonstrated by comparing region of interest (ROI) and an AdC heatmap generated by the device to Ground Truth (GT) determined as “positive”, or “benign” by the GT pathologists. Results showed the area marked by AdC heatmap is consistent with the GT, thus the Galen Second Read localization is accurate and precise in detecting tissue area that belong to cancer foci in a population of adult male subjects who have undergone PCNB.

# B. Clinical Performance:

Clinical validation studies using the Galen Second Read demonstrated the device’s ability to improve clinical performance. The Galen Second Read demonstrated an increase in detection of prostatic AdC in PCNBs, enabling the identification of positive cases (cancer, including AdC, ASAP (atypical small acinar proliferation) and other rare cancer subtypes) that may have been missed at the initial read by the pathologist.

Two clinical studies were conducted to assess the performance of the Galen Second Read.

In the first study, the performance of the Galen Second Read in identifying prostatic adenocarcinoma cases (subjects) missed by Standard of Care (SoC) in a population of subjects who have undergone PCNB was assessed. This study was performed with retrospectively collected samples, and it was conducted at three sites [2 US sites and 1 Outside the US (OUS)]. The device analyzed scanned histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) from 347 cases who were initially diagnosed as benign based on the prostate core needle biopsies. The WSIs were scanned with a Philips scanner at $4 0 \mathrm { x }$ magnification. Slides from 347 cases were then processed by Galen Second Read and each slide was either “Flag” (Positive) or “No Flag” (Negative).

In the study, Ground Truth (GT) determination with regard to GT for a slide and GT for a case (subject) was performed in a following way: the GT determination for a slide was performed by two independent expert pathologists; slides where the pathologists disagreed, a third independent expert pathologist was asked to review the slide and the majority rule determined the GT for the slide. Slides with prostatic AdC or other cancer ASAP were considered GT positive slides.

For slide-level analysis, the definitions of True Positive (TP), False Positive (FP), True Negative (TN), and False Negative (FN) are as follows:

<table><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Definition</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">TP slide</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Slide is GT positive and Flagged by device</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">FP slide</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Slide is GT negative and Flagged by device</td></tr><tr><td>FN slide</td><td>Slide is GT positive and Not Flagged by device</td></tr><tr><td>TN slide</td><td>Slide is GT negative and Not Flagged by device</td></tr></table>

For case-level analysis, the definitions of TP, FP, TN, and FN are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Definition</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>TP case</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Case has only one GT positive slide and this slide is Flagged by the device</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Case has more than one GT positive slide and at least one of these GT positiveslides is Flagged by device</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>FP case</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Case has all slides GT Negative and at least one slide is Flagged by the device</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>FN case</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Case has one or multiple GT positive slides and all these GT positive slides areNot Flagged (missed) by the device</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>TN case</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Case has all slides GT negative and all slides are not Flagged by the device</td></tr></table>

The Galen Second Read performance (sensitivity and specificity) is provided at the level of a slide (Table 5) and at the level of a case (subject) (Table 6).

The study demonstrated that the Galen™ Second Read™ effectively identifies prostate cancer cases, including ASAP, missed by the $\mathrm { S o C }$ in a population of subjects who have undergone a PCNB. The study demonstrated that sensitivity of the Galen Second Read is higher than the sensitivity of the SoC read (sensitivity of SoC was $0 \%$ because all the slides were diagnosed initially as benign by SoC), both at the slide-level and case-level. In the study there was a decrease in specificity of the Galen Second Read compared to the specificity of SoC (specificity of SoC was $100 \%$ because all the slides were diagnosed initially as benign by SoC) and it can be managed by mitigation measures such as use of additional stains to confirm if the slide/case is positive.

In the second study, difference in performances of a pathologist supported by the Galen Second Read vs GT result and a pathologist with SoC vs GT result in a set of retrospectively collected slides (772 cases/slides: 376 negative cases and 396 positive cases). The study was conducted at 4 sites (3 US and 1 OUS) with 3 pathologists at each site, for a total of 12 pathologists. The study consisted of two arms:

• Arm A: a SoC arm, in which slides were read digitally using the routine lab practice.

• Arm B: a Galen Second Read workflow arm, in which after reading slides digitally, the pathologist reviewed images flagged by the Galen Second Read and decided on a final read determination.

All cases and associated slides were read in both Arms of the study (Arm A and Arm B), each case was read 3 times, once per pathologist, with a washout period of two weeks between Arms to minimize recall bias.

This study demonstrated that the sensitivity of the pathologists using the Galen Second Read for the cases/slides which were initially diagnosed as benign was $3 6 . 3 \%$ with $9 5 \% C \mathrm { I } ;$ $( 2 8 . 0 \%$ ; $4 5 . 5 \% )$ ) (sensitivity without the device was $0 \%$ because all the slides were diagnosed initially as benign by SoC), yielding increase in sensitivity of $3 6 . 3 \%$ .

Specificity of the pathologist using the Galen Second Read for the cases/slides which were initially diagnosed as benign was $9 6 . 5 \%$ with $9 5 \% C \mathrm { I }$ : $( 9 5 . 2 \% ; 9 7 . 5 \% )$ (specificity without the device was $1 0 0 \%$ , yielding decrease in specificity of $3 . 5 \%$ . The decrease in specificity can be managed by mitigation measures such as use of additional stains to confirm if the slide/case is positive.

# V Substantial Equivalence Determination:

The Galen™ Second Read™ device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
