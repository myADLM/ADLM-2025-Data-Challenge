It is an aid to the pathologist to review, interpret and manage digital images of pathology slides for primary diagnosis. Viewer+ is not intended for use with frozen sections, cytology, or non-FFPE hematopathology specimens.

It is the responsibility of a qualified pathologist to employ appropriate procedures and safeguards to assure the quality of the images obtained and, where necessary, use conventional light microscopy review when making a diagnostic decision. Viewer+ is intended for use with Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner and BARCO MDPC-8127 display.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

Viewer+, version 1.0.1, is a web-based software device that facilitates the viewing and navigating of digitized pathology images of slides prepared from FFPE-tissue specimens acquired from Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner and viewed on BARCO MDPC8127 display. Viewer+ renders these digitized pathology images for review, management, and navigation for pathology primary diagnosis.

Viewer+ is operated as follows:

1. Image acquisition is performed using the NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner according to its Instructions for Use. The operator performs quality control of the digital slides per the instructions of the NanoZoomer and lab specifications to determine if re-scans are necessary.   
2. Once image acquisition is complete and the image becomes available in the scanner’s database file system, a separate medical image communications software (not part of the device) automatically uploads the image and its corresponding metadata to persistent cloud storage. Image and data integrity checks are performed during the upload to ensure data accuracy.   
3. The subject device enables the reading pathologist to open a patient case, view the images, and perform actions such as zooming, panning, measuring distances and areas, and annotating images as needed. After reviewing all images for a case, the pathologist will render a diagnosis.

Viewer+ operates with and is validated for use with the components specified the tables below:

# B Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: Viewer+

2. Specimen Identification:

Viewer+ uses digital pathology images obtained from the Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained glass slides. The reading pathologist selects a case (patient) from a worklist (within the device or external to the device) whereby the subject device fetches the associated images from the external image storage. The scanned images are identified based on the previously assigned specimen identifier such as the laboratory specimen accession number.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Specimen sampling and handling are performed upstream and independent of the use of the subject device. Specimen sampling includes biopsy or resection specimens which are processed using histology techniques. The FFPE tissue section is Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained. Digital images are then obtained from these glass slides using the Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner.

4. Calibration:

Not applicable

# 5. Quality Control:

The scanning technician should perform quality control of all glass slides following the instructions. Upon scanning, quality control should be performed on all digital slide images following procedures defined by the scanner manufacturer prior to import into Viewer+. The pathologist should review all images to ensure that all expected slides have been imported by viewing the thumbnails and labels, and manually verifying the tissue specimen, block, and staining information is present.

# B Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:

Technical performance testing was conducted with the subject device, Viewer+ as specified below.

# 1. Bench Testing – Pixelwise comparison test

Pixel-wise comparison testing to demonstrate identical image reproduction was conducted to compare WSIs reproduced by the subject device and the comparators as listed in Table 3 below. The subject device was compared to the predicate device’s image review manipulation software (IRMS, as defined in FDA guidance document, “Technical Performance Assessment of Digital Pathology Whole Slide Imaging Devices” dated April 20, 2016) using the quantitative pixel-wise comparison method. The basis for the comparison was the CIEDE2000 color difference equation, ΔE00. The devices were tested as operating with the intended components, including the scanner, specific file format, image management systems (subject device with the intended browsers, comparator [predicate device IRMS]) and display, as specified in the Table 3 below.

For each of the 4 configurations in Table 3 below, the device was tested with multiple slides across multiple regions of interest (ROI) at multiple magnification levels. A total of 30 H&Estained, FFPE glass slides of normal and tumor tissues from various human anatomical organs were used in the testing. The glass slides were scanned on a Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner to obtain 30 WSIs. For each of the 30 WSIs, 3 ROIs were selected by qualified personnel to represent various features in the tissue samples. Each ROI was captured at 3 magnification levels (10x, 20x, 40x).

The screenshots were captured from the intended display while viewing with the subject device and predicate device IRMS. The screenshots were cropped and registered to be pixelwise comparable. The cropped image included most of the pixels in the image except for those in the viewer-specific user interface areas.

For each configuration, two sets of images were collected: comparator (predicate device IRMS) and the subject device (Viewer+ with the intended browser). Each image set included 270 images that covered all combinations of 30 slides, 3 ROIs, and 3 magnification levels. The testing data, including the overview images of the 30 glass slides with annotations of the ROIs, registration/cropping information, and captured images, were provided in the FDA specific format.

The comparator (predicate device IRMS) image set was used as the reference to compare the subject device image set to determine whether all the 270 image-pairs were identical for each configuration. Two images are considered identical if the 95th percentile of the pixelwise differences, computed using the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) color difference metric CIEDE2000 (ΔE00), is less than $3 ~ \Delta \mathrm { E } _ { 0 0 }$ . Testing results showed that the pixelwise differences across all 270 image-pairs per configuration were less than $3 ~ \Delta \mathrm { E } _ { 0 0 }$ . The maximum (max), minimum (min), and mean of the 95th percentile $\Delta \mathrm { E 0 0 }$ value were reported in Table 3. Testing results demonstrated that WSIs reproduced by Viewer+ are identical to images reproduced by the predicate device.

# 3. Measurement – distance and area

Measurement accuracy testing was performed to demonstrate that Viewer+ represents length and areal measurements accurately across multiple magnification levels. Four biological glass slides were scanned on Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner, and then measured by qualified medical professionals using the Hamamatsu NZViewMD software and Viewer $^ +$ measurement tools on the supported Barco MDPC-8127 display. A randomized set of tests is chosen to test 4 biological glass slide images, 4 supported browsers (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari), 4 rotations, 4 zooms, 2 directions, and 2 types of measurements (length and areal). The intended and reported metrics were recorded for each annotation. The differences between intended and reported measurements were calculated, as summarized below in Table 5. Acceptance criteria was set at $+ / - 0 . 1 \mathrm { m m }$ of pathologist annotation for length, and $+ / - 0 . 1 \mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 }$ for area measurements. Test results showed that the acceptance criteria were met, and the subject device performed accurate measurements of length across multiple magnification settings with respect to its intended use.
