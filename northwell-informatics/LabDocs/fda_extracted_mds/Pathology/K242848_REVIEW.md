II Review Summary:

A Purpose for Submission:

Addition of a new display (monitor) C411W from manufacturer Shenzhen Beacon.

# B Type of Test:

The Philips IntelliSite Pathology Solution (PIPS) 5.1 is an automated digital slide creation, viewing, and management system.

III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

B Indication(s) for Use:

The Philips IntelliSite Pathology Solution (PIPS) 5.1 is an automated digital slide creation, viewing, and management system. The PIPS 5.1 is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid to the pathologist to review and interpret digital images of surgical pathology slides prepared from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. The PIPS 5.1 is not intended for use with frozen section, cytology, or non-FFPE hematopathology specimens.

The PIPS 5.1 comprises the Image Management System (IMS) 4.2, Ultra-Fast Scanner (UFS), Pathology Scanner SG20, Pathology Scanner SG60, Pathology Scanner SG300 and Philips PP27QHD display or a Beacon C411W display. The PIPS 5.1 is for creation and viewing of digital images of scanned glass slides that would otherwise be appropriate for manual visualization by conventional light microscopy. It is the responsibility of a qualified pathologist to employ appropriate procedures and safeguards to assure the validity of the interpretation of images obtained using PIPS 5.1.

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

# IV Device/System Characteristics:
