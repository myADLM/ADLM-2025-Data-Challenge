II Review Summary:

A Purpose for Submission:

Addition of a new display (monitor) MDCC-4430 from manufacturer Barco.

# B Type of Test:

The Philips IntelliSite Pathology Solution (PIPS) 5.1 is an automated digital slide creation, viewing, and management system.

III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

# A Intended Use(s):

See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

The Philips IntelliSite Pathology Solution (PIPS) 5.1 is an automated digital slide creation, viewing, and management system. The PIPS 5.1 is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid to the pathologist to review and interpret digital images of surgical pathology slides prepared from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. The PIPS 5.1 is not intended for use with frozen section, cytology, or non-FFPE hematopathology specimens.

The PIPS 5.1 comprises the Image Management System (IMS) 4.2, Ultra-Fast Scanner (UFS), Pathology Scanner SG20, Pathology Scanner SG60, Pathology Scanner SG300 and Philips PP27QHD display, a Beacon C411W display or a Barco MDCC-4430 display. The PIPS 5.1 is for creation and viewing of digital images of scanned glass slides that would otherwise be appropriate for manual visualization by conventional light microscopy. It is the responsibility of a qualified pathologist to employ appropriate procedures and safeguards to assure the validity of the interpretation of images obtained using PIPS 5.1.

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The PIPS 5.1 device is an automated digital slide creation, viewing and management system. PIPS 5.1 consists of the following components:

a. Whole slide imaging scanners:

i. Ultra Fast Scanner (UFS) ii. Pathology Scanner Second Generation (SG) with different versions for varying slide capacity: Pathology Scanner SG20, Pathology Scanner SG60, Pathology Scanner SG300 b. Image Management System (IMS) 4.2 c. Philips PP27QHD, Beacon C411W or Barco MDCC-4430 display

There are no changes to the whole slide imaging scanners, IMS 4.2 and PP27QHD display since the previous clearance in K233204. There are no changes to the Beacon C411W display since the previous clearance in K242848. The MDCC-4430 display is a 4MP display.
