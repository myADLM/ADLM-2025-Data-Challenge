# Indications for Use

510(k) Number (if known): K050024

Device Name: Multiple Drugs of Abuse Assays

Indications For Use:

One Step Multiple Drugs of Abuse Assays is used for the qualitative determination of the following drugs of abuse in urine:

Product Name Cutoff Amphetamine (amphetamine) 1000ng/ml Barbiturate (secobarbital) 300ng/ml Benzodiazipines (oxazepam) 300ng/ml Cocaine (benzoylecgonine) 300ng/ml Methamphetamine (methamphetamine) 1000ng/ml Morphine (morphine) 300ng/ml Opiate (morphine) 2000ng/ml Methadone (methadone) 300ng/ml Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (methylenedioxymethamphetamine) 500ng/ml Phencyclidine (phencyclidine) 25ng/ml Tricyclic antidepressant drugs (nortriptyline) 1000ng/ml Cannabinoids (tetrahydrocannabinol-COOH) 50ng/ml

The configurations of the One Step Multiple Drugs of Abuse Assays are available in any combination of the above tests. These devices are intended to be used by healthcare professionals only. For in vitro diagnostic use. Measurements obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis and treatment of use or overdose of the drugs listed above.

This assay provides only a preliminary result. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly in evaluating a preliminary positive result. To obtain a confirmed analytical result, a more specific alternate chemical method is needed. Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) is the recommended confirmatory method.
