# Product Names:

On Call™ Multi-Drug Home Test for Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Opiates, and Phencyclidine

# Common Name:

Immunochromatographic test for the qualitative detection of Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Opiates, and Phencyclidine in urine.

# Regulation Name:

Marijuana. Cocaine, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Opiates, and Phencyclidine test system.

# Product Code:

LDJ, DIO, DKZ, LAF, DJG, LCM

# Classification Number:

21 CFR 862.3870, 21 CFR 862.3250, 21 CFR 862.3100, 21 CFR 862.3610, 21 CFR 862.3650

# Device Classification:

The Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Opiates, and Phencyclidine test systems have been classified as Class II devices with moderate complexity. The On Call™ MultiDrug Home Test for Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Opiates, and Phencyclidine is similar to another FDA-cleared device (ACON One Step Multi-Drug Multi-Line Screen Test, K020313) for the qualitative detection of Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Opiates, and Phencyclidine in urine specimens. This test is used to provide only a preliminary analytical result. All positive test results obtained with these devices must be confirmed by another test method, preferably GC/MS analysis.

# Statement of Intended Use Compared to Other Products:

The On Call™ Multi-Drug Home Test for Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Opiates, and Phencyclidine is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Opiates, and Phencyclidine in urine at a cutoff concentration of $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for Marijuana, $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for Cocaine, $1 { , } 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { \mathfrak { n g / m L } }$ for Amphetamine, $1 , 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for Methamphetamine, $2 { , } 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for Opiates, and $2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for Phencyclidine. This test is used to provide only a preliminary analytical result. All positive test results obtained with these devices must be confirmed by another test method, preferably GC/MS analysis. They are intended for the over-the-counter lay person use.

# Discussion of Technological Characteristics:

The On Call™ Multi-Drug Home Test for Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Opiates, and Phencyclidine is a competitive binding, lateral flow immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative screening of Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Opiates, and Phencyclidine in a urine sample. The test is based on the principle of antigen-antibody immunochemistry. It utilizes the mouse monoclonal antibody to selectively detect elevated levels of Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Opiates, Phencyclidine, and their metabolites in urine at a cutoff concentration of $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for Marijuana, $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for Cocaine, $1 { , } 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for Methamphetamine, $2 { , } 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for Opiates, and $2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for Phencyclidine. This test can be performed without the use of an instrument.

A drug-positive urine specimen will not generate a colored-line in the designated test region, while a negative urine specimen or a urine specimen containing Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamine,

Methamphetamine, Opiates, or Phencyclidine at the concentration below the cutoff level will generate a colored-line in the test region. To serve as a procedural control, a colored-line should always appear at the control region, indicating that proper volume of specimen has been added and membrane wicking has occurred.

# Safety and Effectiveness Data:

Because the On Call™ Multi-Drug Home Test for Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Opiates, and Phencyclidine is identical to the ACON One Step Multi-Drug Multi-Line Screen Test Card/Device that is legally marketed under K020313 for professional use, and because no special skills, training, education, or licensing is required to transfer a few drops of a urine sample into the test card well, there is no issue regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product to perform its intended function, i.e., to screen urine for the presence or absence of THC, COC, AMP, mAMP, OPI, PCP, and their metabolites. Because the labeling of the On Call™M Multi-Drug Home Test for Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Opiates, and Phencyclidine is substantially equivalent to a variety of rapid screening tests currently in commercial distribution, including the First Check® Home Drug Test and the Phamatech At Home™ Drug Test, and there have been no reports of consumer inability to follow instructions or interpret results over the many months these products have been purchased, it should be concluded that the product can be used effectively by the lay user.

Dear Dr. Tung:

We have reviewed your Scction 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (sec above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class I (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. ln addition, FDA mav publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please bc advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

# 13. INDICATIONS FOR USE

510(k) Number (if known):

Device Name: On Call™ Multi-Drug Home Test for Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Opiates, and Phencyclidine

Indications for Use:

The On Call™ Multi-Drug Home Test for Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Opiates, and Phencyclidine is a screening test for the rapid detection of Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Opiates, and Phencyclidine in urine at a designated cut-off concentration of 50 ng/mL for Marijuana, 300 ng/mL for Cocaine, 1,000 ng/mL for Amphetamine, 1,000 ng/mL for Methamphetamine, 2,000 ng/mL for Opiates, and 25 ng/mL for Phencyclidine. The test is intended for over-the-counter (OTC) consumer use.

This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.
