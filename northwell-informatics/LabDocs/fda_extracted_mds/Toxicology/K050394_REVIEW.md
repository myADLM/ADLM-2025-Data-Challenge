# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indications for use.

2. Indication(s) for use:

The SURE-SCREEN Drugs of Abuse Test System uses immunochromatographic test strips for the rapid, qualitative detection of one or more of the following: Amphetamines, Benzodiazepines, Cocaine, Methamphetamine, Methadone, Opiates, Phencyclidine and THC (Cannabinoids) in human urine. It is intended for prescription point-of-care use including workplace settings, criminal justice or forensic settings, drug rehabilitation clinics, physician offices and laboratory settings. SURE-SCREEN is not for over-the-counter sale.

Operators that may use this device are defined as individuals with a minimum of a high school education with no formal laboratory training or experience. Individuals should also satisfy the following training and certification guidelines: (1)Training should be conducted by a qualified professional and include a demonstration of the SURE-SCREEN test system and (2) the use of quality assurance samples for monitoring and confirming the performance of the test system. Trainers should observe and confirm that the operator (3) uses proper technique when running a test sample and quality assurance samples, (4) has a basic understanding of test results, including a the potential for false positive and false negative results, (5) knows how to prepare a sample for shipment to the laboratory for confirmation testing, (6) has reviewed the information contained in the MEDTOX SURE-SCREEN Training and Certification Program (available at www.medtox.com and that the operator (7) minimally achieves a score of $80 \%$ on the written exam provided by MEDTOX .

Operators achieving a score of $80 \%$ will be provided with a certificate of training participation. Quality assurance samples appropriate for training are available from MEDTOX Laboratories Inc. Additionally, MEDTOX Technical Support will provide access to assistance from individuals who are experienced in the

interpretation of drug testing results.

Sure-Screen detects drug classes at the following cutoff concentrations:

(AMP) Amphetamines (d-Amphetamine) 300 ng/mL (BZO) Benzodiazepines (Nordiazepam) 200 ng/mL (COC) Cocaine (Benzoylecgonine) 100 ng/mL (MAMP) Methamphetamine (d-Methamphetamine) 300 ng/mL (MTD) Methadone (Methadone) 200 ng/mL (OPI) Opiates (Morphine) 100 ng/mL (PCP) Phencyclidine (Phencyclidine) 25 ng/mL (THC) Cannabinoids (11-nor-9-carboxy- $\cdot \Delta ^ { \mathfrak { g } }$ -THC) 40 ng/mL

Many of the cutoff concentrations for these tests are below those recommended by SAMHSA. Additionally, many of these tests are positive at levels significantly below the claimed cutoff concentration. The rate of false positive results with tests having sensitivities this low has not been studied. However, the rate of false positives generally increases as the cutoff concentration of the test is lowered. See the Precision/Sensitivity section for more information.

The SURE-SCREEN drugs of abuse test system provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result.

It is the responsibility of those organizations required to follow Department of Transportation (DOT) or Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Workplace Drug Testing Guidelines to determine that use of this product satisfies the criteria for workplace testing established under DOT and SAMHSA authority.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): The device is for in vitro diagnostic prescription use.

4. Special instrument requirements: Not applicable. The device is a visually read single-use device.

# I. Device Description:

The device consists of a single-use test cup with a specialized lid. The lid contains individual test strips for each of the drugs being tested. When the cup is tipped, the urine comes into contact with the bottom of each test strip, thereby initiating the

reaction. Users determine the result by visually determining the presence or absence of a line. Each strip includes an internal process control.

This device is a one-step immunochromatographic test intended for the detection of amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cocaine, methamphetamine/MDMA, methadone, opiates, phencyclidine and cannabinoids in human urine. The principle of the test relies upon the competitive binding of unbound drug and drug bound to protein (applied as a test line on the nitrocellulose) with the specific antibody (absorbed to colloidal gold) targeted to the drug.

The device includes adulteration checks, the Lateral Flow Adulterant Strip, or LFAS. There is also a temperature check on the cup. Because these are not medical devices, they are not included in the review and do not appear in the indications for use.

The sponsor indicates the test does not contain any human source material.

The training guide and certification, including a 17 question quiz is included with the submission.

# J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

1. Predicate device name(s): PROFILE II and PROFILE-ER

2. Predicate 510(k) number(s): k982211 and k002331

3. Comparison with predicate:

Both devices are qualitative immunochromatographic visually read single-use tests for measurement of the same analyte(s) in the same matrix. Both are competitive immunoassays.

The cutoff concentrations vary, with the candidate device having lower cutoffs in all but one of the assays, i.e., PCP. The candidate device has also been modified to a cup-type configuration.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

The sponsor did not reference any guidance documents or standards.

# L. Test Principle:

Each test strip contains antibody colloidal gold, a drug conjugate and a control line. Mouse monoclonal antibodies are mixed with colloidal gold and applied to the sample well pads of the strip. Drug is conjugated to protein and immobilized at the test line. Strips have an anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody immobilized at the control line. The anti-mouse antibody binds the mouse antibodies coated on the colloidal gold.

When the test cup is tipped over, urine flows into the sample well of the device, the dried antibody-colloidal gold on the sample pad dissolves and the urine wicks up the white test strips carrying the red antibody-colloidal gold with it.

# Interpretation of Results

Negative: When no drug is present in the urine sample, the red antibody-colloidal gold migrates up the test strip and binds to the drug conjugate immobilized on the membrane. The binding of the antibody-colloidal gold to the drug conjugate generates a line at the test line.

Non-negative: When a drug is present in the sample the antibody-colloidal gold binds the drug before it migrates up the test strip. However, when the antibodycolloidal gold binds the drug in the urine, the antibody-colloidal gold can not bind to the drug conjugate immobilized on the test strip. When the drug concentrating is at or above the cutoff concentration, the majority of the antibody colloidal gold is bound to the drug from the urine. Therefore, as drug bound antibody-colloidal gold migrates up the test strip it is unable to bind to the drug conjugate immobilized on the membrane. Therefore no line is generated at the “T” location on the device.

Control Line: Each test strip has an internal procedural control. A control line forms when the antibody-colloidal gold binds to the anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody immobilized on the membrane at the $^ { \circ \mathfrak { c } } C ^ { \mathfrak { n } } { } ^ { , }$ location on the device. A line must form at the control $^ { \circ \mathfrak { c } } C ^ { \mathfrak { n } } { } ^ { , }$ location on the device to indicate that there was an adequate volume of sample, the reagents migrated properly, and that the test strip is intact.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Performance around the cutoff concentration for each drug was evaluated by testing drug-free urines spiked with standard solutions. Drug-free urines were also tested. Testing was performed in triplicate on 5 different occasions by 3 Medtox employees. Results were read at five minutes.

Data from this study is pooled and presented, below. There were significant differences between results read by different operators. However, most often this occurred below the claimed cutoff concentration, and may not be as significant. Many positive results are observed significantly below the cutoff concentration. There are also negative results occurring at and above the cutoff. The sponsor has no explanation for these inconsistencies other than operator error.

Results are similar in this POC study to those observed in the professional study.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable. The assay is intended for qualitative use.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The sponsor did not indicate any degree of traceability for their devices.

Control materials are required but are not specifically identified in the labeling.

No calibrators are required. The device is calibrated during the manufacturing process.

# Product Stability:

Stability studies depend on readouts from an instrument (BioDot ). The BioDot reader takes a picture of a test line, and converts it to a number which is proportional to the line intensity. Readings less that 0.6 are typically read as positive (absence of a line) and those above 1.1 are typically read as negative (a line is present). Those between 0.6 and 1.1 are visually interpreted as borderline results. The sponsor provided the following in support of these conclusions.

Artificial Test Strips were used to simulate lines on a test strip. Numerous Test Strips were read by 29 operators. The BioDot range of readings are compared to the visual observations of the readers.

Stability Protocol:

Drug tests are stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and room temperature.

Drug tests are assayed at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 25 months intervals.

Twenty samples are run on each of three different lots of each of each drug test.

The twenty replicates consist of the following:

5 replicates of a positive urine (containing drug at a concentration of $50 \%$ above the cutoff) 15 replicates of a drug-free urine

Readings are recorded and averaged for each lot.

Acceptance Criteria for the Study:

Drug-free urine should have a BioDot reading of 2.5 reading or greater. Individual test line intensities should be 2.0 or greater. Urine spiked with drug $50 \%$ above the cutoff should have an average BioDot test line intensity of 0.6 or less. Individual test line intensities should be 0.8 or less.

Calculations used to estimate shelf life are:

At 20K Cal/mole; 12 months (365 days) at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is equivalent to 44 days at $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ ; 15 months at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is equivalent to 55 days at $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . 24 months at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ is equivalent to 88 days at $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

Users are instructed to follow federal, state, and local guidelines concerning QC practices.

# d. Detection limit:

Sensitivity of qualitative assays may be characterized by validating performance around the claimed cutoff concentration of the assay, and demonstrating the lowest concentration of drug that is capable of or consistently producing a positive result. This information appears in the precision section, above.

Most tests render positive results well below the claimed cutoff concentration.

# e. Analytical specificity:

# Cross-Reactivity

The following metabolites and compounds were initially dissolved in appropriate solvents and then added at varying concentrations to drug-free urine for evaluation. Samples were evaluated in triplicate by in-house operators. Results are expressed as the minimum concentration of metabolite or compound required to produce a positive test result. Percent cross reactivity of a compound is calculated by dividing the cutoff concentration by the minimum concentration required to obtain a positive result and then multiplying by $100 \%$ .

f. Assay cut-off:

The PCP cutoff concentration is consistent with the cutoff currently recommended by SAMHSA. However, the cutoff concentrations for amphetamines, cocaine, methamphetamines, opiates, and THC are below those recommended by SAMHSA. There are currently no recommendations for the rest of the tests.

There has been no evaluation of false positive rates using these cutoff concentrations. The sponsor has, however, included the following information in their package insert:

A positive test result does not always mean a person took illegal drugs and a negative test result does not always mean a person did not take illegal drugs. There are a number of factors that influence the reliability of drug tests. Certain drug of abuse tests are more accurate than others.

For Preliminary Positive Tests: In general, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) reports the accuracy of drug tests $a s ^ { a }$ :

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>60 out of 100 times a &quot;preliminary positive&quot; result from an opiate test is a &quot;falsepreliminary positive&quot; result. This means that the result of the first test was&quot;preliminary positive&quot; even though the person did not take an illegal drug.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>50 out of 100 times a &quot;preliminary positive&quot; test result from an amphetamine ormethamphetamine test is a &quot;false preliminary positive&quot; result.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>50 out of 100 times a &quot;preliminary positive&quot; result from a PCP (phencyclidine)test is a &quot;false preliminary positive&quot; result.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10 out of 100 times a &quot;preliminary positive&quot; result from a marijuana test is a&quot;false preliminary positive&quot; result.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2 out of 100 times a &quot;preliminary positive&quot; result from a cocaine test is a &quot;falsepreliminary positive&quot; result.</td></tr></table>

a Data was generated from laboratory tests that have the following cutoff concentrations: Marijuana, 50 ng/mL; Cocaine, 300 ng/mL; Phencyclidine, 25 ng/mL; Opiates, 2000 ng/mL; Amphetamines, 1000 ng/mL. In general, the rates of false preliminary positive results will increase as the cutoff concentration of the test is lowered.

Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff concentration appears in the precision section (M,1, a), above.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison studies:

Performance was evaluated by assaying a panel of blind coded clinical urine samples containing varying concentrations of drugs with Sure-Screen. Results were then

compared to GC/MS or LC/MS/MS results. Samples were obtained from MEDTOX Laboratories. There were screened using a commercial immunoassay having traditional cutoff concentrations, i.e., significantly higher than Sure-Screen cutoff concentrations (except for PCP). Samples with negative results by both the commercial immunoassay system and Sure-Screen were not confirmed. Samples with positive results by either the commercial immunoassay system or Sure-Screen were confirmed by GC/MS or LC/MS/MS. Most samples were unaltered clinical samples, however, to include samples with concentrations close to the cutoff 6 BZO samples were diluted with negative urine. Testing was performed by MEDTOX personnel. Readings were taken at 5 minutes.

# POC Studies

Performance was also evaluated by 13 POC staff at 44 POC locations. Operators ran 1000 blinded samples obtained from MEDTOX Laboratories. Sure-Screen test results were compared to GC/MS or LC/MS/MS results. Operators were provided with instructions from the package insert. Almost all operators had no formal laboratory training, but $8 8 \%$ of the operators had run point-of-care testing devices prior to this study. 26/44 operators had greater than a high school education.

Samples were selected similarly to how samples were selected for the in-house study, however this study included a high number of negative samples, and a much lower percentage of positive samples, i.e., a total of 4 or 6 samples. Many studies included few, if any, samples that were challenging to the cutoff concentration of the assay. Samples with negative results by both the commercial immunoassay system and Sure-Screen were not confirmed. Samples with positive results by either the commercial immunoassay system or Sure-Screen were confirmed by GC/MS or LC/MS/MS.

11-nor-9-carboxy- $\overline { { \Delta ^ { 9 } } }$ -THC concentrations are reported in this table.

.b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable. The assay is intended for only one sample matrix.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity:

Not applicable. Clinical studies are not typically submitted for this device type and matrix.

b. Clinical specificity:

Not applicable. Clinical studies are not typically submitted for this device type and matrix. The specificity is likely to be less than traditional assays, however, as the cutoff concentrations are significantly lower.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

4. Clinical cut-off:

Validation of the clinical appropriateness of the cutoff is not typically submitted for this device type and matrix.

5. Expected values/Reference range: No elicit drugs should be present in urine. Legitimate over-the-counter and prescription drugs may cause positive results.

# N. O therSupportiveInstrum entPerform anceCharacteristicsDataNotCovered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

The device also includes tests for detected adulteration of the sample. Because these products are not medical devices, aspects related to this claim were not reviewed. References to the adulteration checks are therefore not included in the intended use statement, but appear in the package insert.

# O. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# P. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
