# Predicate Device(s)

The LZl Methadone Oral Fluid Enzyme Immunoassay is substantially equivalent to the Methadones Intercept $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Micro-plate EIA (K002010) manufactured by OraSure Technologies Inc. (formerly known as STC Technologies, Inc) for its general intended use.

# Device Description

LZI's Oral Fluid Methadone Enzyme Immunoassay is a ready-to-use, liquid reagent, homogeneous enzyme immunoassay. The assay uses specific antibodies that can detect methadone in oral fluid with minimal cross-reactivity to various, common prescription drugs and abused drugs. The assay is based on competition between drug labeled with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) enzyme and free drug from the saliva sample for a fixed amount of specific antibody. In the absence of free drug from the saliva sample the specific antibody binds to the drug labeled G6PDH enzyme causing a decrease in enzyme activity. It is therefore the drug concentration is proportional to the enzyme activity. The G6PDH enzyme activity is determined spectrophotometrically at $3 4 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ by measuring its ability to covert nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH.

# Intended Use

The Methadone Enzyme Immunoassays for Drugs of Abuse in Oral Fluid is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay system to detect methadone in human saliva with a cutoff of $3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ when testing oral fluid specimen collected with Salivette collector (manufactured by Sarstedt ) and diluted with $1 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of buffer. The calibrators and controls of the analyte (Methadone) are prepared with oral fluid buffer so that it can be used to verify and validate the assay. The assay is intended for use in the qualitative determination for Methadone drugs. The assay is designed for professional use with a number of automated clinical chemistry analyzers.

The Methadone Oral Fluid Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay system provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug-ofabuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.

# Comparison to Predicate Device

The LZI Methadone Oral Fluid Homogeneous Enzyme Immunoassay, including calibrators and controls, is substantially equivalent to OraSure's Methadone Intercept $\textcircled{ R}$ Micro-plate ElA in its intended use and in for the qualitative determination of Methadone in human oral fluid.

Dear Ms. Lin:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with al the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
