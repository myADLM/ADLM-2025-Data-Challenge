3. Product code: LAS

4. Panel: 91, Toxicology

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indications for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use:

The MAS Immunosuppressant Controls, consisting of Levels 1 through 3, are in-vitro diagnostic devices intended for use as assayed quality control material to monitor the precision of laboratory testing procedures for cyclosporine, sirolimus and tacrolimus.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): The MAS Immunosuppressant Controls are for professional use only.

4. Special instrument requirements:

# I. Device Description:

The MAS Immunosuppressant Controls are prepared from whole blood with stabilizers added to increase stability. The MAS Immunosuppressant Controls include three separate controls known as Level I, Level II, and Level III with approximately 70, 200, 350 ng/mL of cyclosporine, 5.5, 10, and 15 ng/mL of tacrolimus, and 5.5, 10 and 15 ng/mL of sirolimus.

Human source material from which this product has been derived has been tested at the donor level for the Human Immunodeficient Virus (HIV1, HIV2) antibody, Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HbsAg) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and found to be non-reactive. FDA approved methods have been used to conduct these tests.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None stated

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods)

Target values are set to create three distinct levels, which are obtained by spiking each level to different analyte concentrations. Target values take clinical needs, assay range, imprecision profile and CEDIA specifications into account. Control targets are traceable to gravimetrically prepared primary reference standards and are confirmed by LC-MS/MS.

The MAS Immunosuppressant Controls open vial stability was established by thawing each control level and testing the controls on day 0 and day 14 using the CEDIA Cyclosporine Plus, Sirolimus and Tacrolimus assays. The thawed controls were stored at $2 - 8 ^ { 0 } \mathsf C$ between days 0 and 14; Controls tested on day 14 recover within the established range of the respective CEDIA immunoassay as compared to day 0.

Real-time stability of the controls is established by periodically testing samples to determine recovery. The mean of the LC-MS/MS result on test recovery must fall within $\pm 2$ SD of the LC-MS/MS initial value. Real-time stability studies support a claim of 24 months when stored as directed.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable
