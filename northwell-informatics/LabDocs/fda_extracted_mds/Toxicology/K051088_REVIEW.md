# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): No Standard or

Guidance Document was referenced in this submission

L. Test Principle: N/A

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: N/A c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The calibrators and controls are purchased from a supplier of analytical standards which provides documented traceability to drug standards. The supplier provides a certificate of analysis which includes the description of the material, reference material code and batch number, the certified values, the level of homogeneity and the data generated by GC/MS and HPLC. The concentrations of the calibrators and controls were confirmed with GC/MS. In addition some of the calibrators and controls are compared to calibration curves prepared from USP Reference Materials.

# Stability

The calibrators and controls were split into two $1 5 { \mathrm { - m L } }$ vials with dropper tip and screwon cap. When not in use, these vials were always capped. One set of aliquots containing the different levels of calibrators and controls were stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ while the other set of aliquots were stored at room temperature, $2 2 { - } 2 5 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ . The signals produced by the assays were compared at day 1, day 143, day 189 and day 244. The data demonstrates that the analytes are stable in the matrix; there is no significant difference in rate produced by the two sets of calibrators/controls. Based on these studies, the stability is expected to be at least 18 months. The sponsor specifies the concentrations of materials evaluated in the studies, the frequency of testing, the method for testing the materials, and the environmental conditions of storage. Accelerated studies are being used by the sponsor to estimate the expiration date; however, on-going real time studies are being performed.

# Expected Values

The Negative Calibrator is a processed, drug free urine matrix. The Low, Cutoff, Intermediate and High Calibrators are prepared by spiking known concentrations of drug analyte into the Negative Calibrator matrix. Control Level 1 and 2 are prepared by spiking known concentrations of drug analyte into the Negative Calibrator matrix. The concentrations are confirmed by GC/MS. Refer to section I for drug concentrations in the calibrators/controls.
