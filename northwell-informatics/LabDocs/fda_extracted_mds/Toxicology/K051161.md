# Indications for Use

510(k) Number (if known):_k051161

Device Name: Quest Diagnostics HairCheck-DT (Amphetamines)

Indications For Use:

QUEST DIAGNOSTICS HairCheck-DT (Amphetamines) is a test system that utilizes the IDS One-Step ELISA MDMA/Methamphetamine Kit for the qualitative detection of amphetamines at concentrations at or above 300 pg/mg hair for the purpose of identifying chronic methamphetamine use and use of MDMA. This test system has not been evaluated for use with other populations or with hair specimens other than head. It is an in vitro diagnostic device intended exclusively for inhouse professional use only and not intended for sale to anyone.

The QUEST DIAGNOSTICS HairCheck-DT (Amphetamines) provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed result. Gas Chromatograph - Mass Spectrometry operating in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode or GC/MS/MS in selected reaction mode (SRM) is the preferred method with deuterated internal standards. Other chemical confirmation methods are available. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are obtained.
