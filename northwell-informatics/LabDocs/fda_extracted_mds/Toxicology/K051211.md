# SUMMARY OF CLINICAL TESTING

# Accuracy and Linearity

Accuracy and linearity were determined by a study based on the NCCLS guidelineEP6: Evaluation the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement.

# Sensitivity

TheAnalical Sentivty  Leas DetecableosLD he sy as e $1 . 0 \mu \ g / m L$

The Functional Sensitivity r Limi  Quantitation LQ)o theassay was determned t e $3 . 0 \mu 9 / \eta \mathsf { L }$

# Assay Range

Based on the Accuracy, Linearity, and Sensitivity (LDD and LOQ) data, the package insert claim for the reportable range for the assay is 3.0 to $5 0 . 0 ~ | \mu g / m L$ .

# Method Comparison

Correlation studies were conducted using NCCLS Guideline EP9: Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples as a guideline to compare accuracy of recovery of Zonisamide in serum and plasma assayed by the $\ Q M S ^ { \otimes }$ Zo sa  an HPLe .

# Precision

A precision study was performed using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) guideline EP5: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices.

# Specificity

There are two known major metabolites of zonisamide: N-acety zonisamide (NAZ) and sulfamoyl acety oATs sut nicate that the  siant coss-aciviyrithe metabolites.

# Interferences

Interference studies were conducted using NCCLS Guideline EP7: Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry. The results of the study indicated that of 26 drugs tested, none showed crossreactivity in the QMS zonisamide assay system.

# CONCLUSION

As summarized above, the $\mathsf { Q M S } ^ { \otimes }$ Zonisamide assay is substantially equivalent to the Innofluor® Phenytoin assay. Substantial equivalence has been demonstrated through performance testing to verify that the device functions as intended and that design specifications have been satisfied.

Dear Mr. Rogers:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ EY premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
