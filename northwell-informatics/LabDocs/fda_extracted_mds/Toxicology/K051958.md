# MP RapidOXY Test Strip and MP RapidBUP Test Strip Premarket Notification

PART 1 - Administrative Information

# 1I. 510(k) SUMMARY

# A. Product Information

Rapid Diagnostics, a division of MP Biomedicals, LLC, has developed two additional drug-of-abuse tests kits for the detection of oxycodone and buprenorphine in human urine samples. These two test strips complement the current panel for DOA analysis, the MICROMEDIC® Drugs of Abuse Panel Test (KO33566). The MICROMEDIC® Drugs of Abuse Panel Test is an immunochromatographic one-step in vitro diagnostic test designed for the qualitative determination of up to nine (9) drug substances in human urine specimens to include amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepine, cocaine, methadone, methamphetamine, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP) and cannabinoid (THC).

As will be demonstrated in the following three sections (Parts I, II, and II), both the MP RapidOXY Test Strip and the MP RapidBUP Test Strip are similar in format and intended use as the parent MICROMEDIC® DOA Panel Test. There are to be added to the existing test panel once cleared.

Both the MP RapidOXY Test Strip and the MP RapidBUP Test Strip are based on the principle of specific immunochemical reaction between antibodies and antigens to analyze particular compounds in human urine specimen. The tests rely on the competition for antibody binding between drug conjugate and free drug which may be present in the urine specimen being tested.

# II. 510(k) SUMMARY

# B. Intended Use:

1. Oxycodone

The MP RapidOxY Test Strip is an immunochromatography based one step in vitro test. It is designed for qualitative determination of oxycodone in human urine specimens above a cut-off level of 100 ng/ml. Each oxycodone test kit is used to obtain a visual, qualitative result and is submitted for point-of-care (POC) use. It is not intended for over the counter sale to lay persons.

The assay will provide a preliminary analytical test result, with recommended follow-up using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for a confirmatory result.

# 2. Buprenorphine

The MP RapidBUP Test Strip is also an immunochromatic, one-step in vitro test. It is designed for qualitative determination of buprenorphine's metabolite, buprenorphine-3-beta-d-glucuronide, in human urine specimens above a cut-off level of 10 ng/ml.

As with the oxycodone test kit, the buprenorphine kit is used to obtain a visual, qualitative result and is submitted for point-of-care (POC) use. It is not intended for over the counter sale to lay persons. In addition, the assay will provide only a preliminary analytical test result, with recommended follow-up using GC/MS.

c. Name of Manufacturer: Rapid Diagnostics, Inc. 1429 Rollins Road, Burlingame, California, USA, a division of MP Biomedicals, LLC, hereafter RAPID DIAGNOSTICS.

# D. Principle

The MP RapidOXY Test Strip and the MP RapidBUP Test Strip are based on the principle of specific immunochemical reaction between antibody and antigen to analyze particular compounds in human urine specimens. The assays rely on the competition for binding antibody between drug conjugate and free drug which may be present in urine. When drug is present in the urine specimen, it competes with drug conjugate for the limited amount of antibodydye conjugate.

When the amount of drug is equal or more than the cut-off (i.e., 100 ng/ml oxycodone or 10 ng/ml buprenorphine-3- $\beta$ -d-glucuronide, or B-3- $\beta$ -d-G), it will prevent the binding of drug conjugate to the antibody. Therefore, a positive urine specimen will not show a colored band on the test line zone, indicating a positive result, while the presence of a colored band indicates a negative result.

A control ine is present in the test window to work as procedural control in both assays. This colored band should always appear on the control line zone if the test device is stored in good condition and the test is performed appropriately.

Dear Ms. Hellen:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug. and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (sec above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807): labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
