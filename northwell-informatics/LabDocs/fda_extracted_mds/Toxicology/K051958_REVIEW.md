#

1. Regulation section: 862.3650, Opiate test system

2. Classification: Class II

3. Product code: DJG

4. Panel: 91 (Toxicology)

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indications for use.

2. Indication(s) for use:

The MP RapidBUP Test Strip is an immunochromatography based one step in vitro test. It is designed for qualitative determination of the major metabolite of buprenorphine, buprenorphine-3- $\beta$ -d-glucuronide, in human urine specimens at cut-off level of $1 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ .

The MP RapidBUP Test Strip may be used in a point-of-care (POC) setting and will provide preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) has been established as the preferred confirmatory method by the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.

The MP RapidOXY Test Strip is an immunochromatographic one-step in-vitro test designed for qualitative determination of oxycodone in human urine specimens above a cut-off level of $1 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ .

The MP RapidOXY Test Strip may be used in a point-of-care (POC) setting and will provide preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) has been established as the preferred confirmatory method by the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): The device is for in vitro diagnostic prescription use.

4. Special instrument requirements: Not applicable. The device is a visually read single-use device.

# I. Device Description:

The device is a one-step immunochromatographic test intended for the detection of major metabolite of buprenorphine, buprenorphine-3- $\cdot \beta$ -d-glucuronide, or oxycodone in human urine. The test device contains a membrane strip, which is pre-coated with drug-protein conjugate at the test band region of the membrane strip. A wicking pad containing anti-drug monoclonal antibody-colloidal gold conjugate is placed at one end of the membrane. The device contains a control region which has a different antigen/antibody from the test region. The device is for single-use and visually read.

# J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

1. Predicate device name(s):

$\mathsf { A C O N } ^ { \mathbb { B } }$ OXY One Step Oxycodone Test Strip For Sure One Step Buprenorphine Test Strip

2. Predicate 510(k) number(s): k033047 k042990

3. Comparison with predicate:

Both subject and predicate devices are qualitative immunochromatographic visually read single-use tests for measurement of the same analyte(s) in the same matrix. Both subject and predicate devices are competitive immunoassays.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

The sponsor did not reference any guidance documents or standards.

# L. Test Principle:

The MP RapidBUP Test Strip and MP RapidOXY Test Strip are based on the principle of specific immunochemical reaction between antibodies and antigens to analyze particular compounds in human urine specimen. The assay relies on the competition for binding antibody between drug conjugate and free drug that may be present in the urine specimen being tested. When drug is present in the urine specimen, it competes with drug conjugate for the limited amount of antibody-dye conjugate.

When the amount of drug is equal or more than the cut-off, it will prevent the binding of drug conjugate to the antibody. Therefore, a positive urine specimen will not show a colored band on the test line zone, indicating a positive result, while the presence of a colored band indicates a negative result.

A control line is present in the test window to work as procedural control. This colored band should always appear on the control line regardless the presence of drug or metabolite.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: MP RapidBUP Test Strip

A precision study was conducted to assess the precision at the cut-off level for the MP RapidBUP Test Strip in a point-of-care setting. The control materials used in the study were commercially purchased, aqueous-based controls (GC/MS calibrated), spiked with the targeted drug. The precision study was designed to evaluate the random error of visual interpretation by multiple observers (2 per site) at 3 different point of care settings (tota $\lvert = 3$ sites/6 observers) over a period of two (2) days.

Each site tested 60 samples for the presence of buprenorphine using GCMS calibrated urine controls at three levels: above cutoff, near cutoff, and below cutoff; results are listed below. Note that samples at the cut-off level were all reported as “POS” or $^ { \mathfrak { c } \mathfrak { c } } + { } ^ { \mathfrak { d } \mathfrak { s } }$ .

NOTE: Samples at $< 2 5 \%$ of cut-off will give negative results, samples at cut-off level may give either positive or negative results, samples at $> 2 5 \%$ cut-off level will give positive results.
