II. Date of Preparation of this Summary: July15, 2005

III. Trade Name: First Check $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Multi Drug Cup 7 for Marijuana (THC), Cocaine (COC), Ampethamine (AMP), Methamphetamine (MET), Ecstasy (MDMA), Opiates (OPI) and Phencyclidine (PCP).

IV. Common Name: Home use drug of abuse rapid screening test for Marijuana (THC), Cocaine (COC), Ampethamine (AMP), Methamphetamine (MET), Ecstasy (MDMA), Opiates (OPI) and Phencyclidine (PCP) in urine.

V. Classification Name: Immunoassay for the qualitative detection of drugs of abuse in urine.

VI. The Marketed Products to Which Equivalence is Claimed: The First Check $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Multi Drug Cup 7 for Marijuana (THC), Cocaine (COC), Amphetamine (AMP), Methamphetamine (MET), Ecstasy (MDMA), Opiates (OPI) and Phencyclidine (PCP), that is the subject of this submission is identical to the Ameditech ImmuTest Drug Screen Cup in terms of product design, performance characteristics, materials of construction and manufacturing process. It is also substantially equivalent to the Accu-Stat Home Drug Test Cup, and other commercially available drug screening tests, that qualitatively measure the presence of target drugs or metabolites by visual color one-step immunoassay technology.

VII. Statement of Intended Use Compared to Other Products: The intended use of the First Check $^ { \textregistered }$ Multi Drug Cup 7 for Marijuana (THC), Cocaine (COC), Amphetamine (AMP), Methamphetamine (MET), Ecstasy (MDMA), Opiates () and Phencyclidine (PCP) is substantially equivalent t the listed products; it is a preliminary, rapid screening test for the detection of between one and seven of the above listed drugs and their metabolites in urine (depending on configuration).This product is intended to be the first step in a two step process to provide consumers, including but not limited to concerned parents, with information regarding the presence of Marijuana (THC), Cocaine (COC), Amphetamine (AMP), Methamphetamine (MET), Ecstasy (MDMA), Opiates (OPI) and Phencyclidine (PCP) and their metabolites in a urine sample. Information regarding the second step, confirmatory testing, is provided. The First Check Multi Drug Cup 7 utilizes the following cut-off concentrations: Marijuana at $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , Cocaine at $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ , Amphetamine at $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , Methamphetamine at $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m } !$ , Ecstasy at $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ , Opiates at $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ and Phencyclidine at $2 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ .The predicate device (Ameditech ImmuTest Drug Screen Cup) is intended for professional use while the First Check $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Multi Drug Cup 7 is intended for OTC use.

VIII. Discussion of Technological Characteristics: The First Check $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Multi Drug Cup 7 for Marijuana (THC), Cocaine (COC), Amphetamine (AMP), Methamphetamine (MET), Ecstasy (MDMA), Opiates (OPI) and Phencyclidine (PCP), like other commercially available drug screening tests, qualitatively detects the presence or absence of the above listed drugs and their metabolites in urine, using a one step, rapid chromatographic immunoassay which operates under the principle of recognition and formation of specific antibody/target drug complexes.

A drug-positive urine specimen will not generate a colored line in the test line region because of drug competition, while a drug-negative urine specimen will generate a line in the test region because of the absence of drug competition. To serve as a procedural control, a colored line will always appear at the control line region if the test has been performed properly. If a control line does not appear for any reason, the results are considered invalid and should not be interpreted. The sample should either be retested using a new First Check Multi Drug Cup 7 or the sample should be mailed in for confirmation.

Examples of predicate devices include the First Check $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Home Drug Tests using a single or multi-drug display and the Accu-Stat Drugs of Abuse Home Test Cup. The analytical studies of the identical Ameditech, Inc ImmuTest Drug Screen Cup (K040092 and K042975) indicate that the drug test reacts specifically with the above listed drugs and their metabolites. A consumer study using the First Check $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Home Drug Test for Marijuana (THC), Cocaine (COC), Amphetamine (AMP), Methamphetamine (MET), Ecstasy (MDMA), Opiates (OPI) and Phencyclidine (PCP) demonstrates that the test exhibits excellent overall performance in the hands of lay users. The data supports the conclusion that the consumer can use the First Check® Home Drug Test for Marijuana (THC), Cocaine (COC), Amphetamine (AMP), Methamphetamine (MET), Ecstasy (MDMA), Opiates (OPI) and Phencyclidine (PCP) to obtain immediate,

preliminary information regarding the possible use of THC, COC, AMP, MET, MDMA, OPI and PCP.

IX. Safety and Effectiveness: Because the First Check $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Multi Drug Cup 7 for Marijuana (THC), Cocaine (COC), Amphetamine (AMP), Methamphetamine (MET), Ecstasy (MDMA), Opiates (OPI) and Phencyclidine (PCP) is identical to the Ameditech ImmuTest Drug Screen Cup Test that is legally marketed for professional use under K040092 and K042975, and because no special skills, traigeucation,  licensure arerequire t coc a urie sample andactivae the test, ther is no issu rarding the safety or effetiveness o the prouct to perfor its intende unction, i., to screen urine or the presence r absenc THC, COC, AMP, MET, MDMA, OPI or PCP and their metabolite(s).

Because the labeling of the First Check® Multi Drug Cup 7 for Marijuana (THC), Cocaine (COC), Amphetamine (AMP), Methamphetamine (MET), Ecstasy (MDMA), Opiates (OPI) and Phencyclidine (PCP) is substantially equivalent to a variety of rapid screening tests currently in commercial distribution, including the First Check Home Drug Test Kit, the Phamatech At Home™M Drug Test Cup and the Accu-Stat Home Drug Test Cup, and there have been no reports of consumer inability to follow instructions or interpret results over the many years in which these products have been purchased by the general public, and due to the successful responses from the consumer study for the First Check® Multi Drug Cup 7, it should be concluded that the product can be used effectively by the lay user.
