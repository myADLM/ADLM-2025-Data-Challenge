# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None Referenced

# L. Test Principle:

Not applicable. This submission is for clearance of control material.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable. b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable. c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Value assignment is based on multiple days and duplicate analyses of control solutions at 3 reference laboratories, using HPLC for nortriptyline, LC/MS/MS for LSD and GCMS for all other drugs. The manufacturer recommends that laboratories using Liquicheck controls should use these results only as a reference and establish its own parameters for performance.

Open vial stability $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ was tested at 6 time points (0, 8, 14, 22, 30 and 39 days), the last of which $\mathrm { ( T _ { f i n a l } ) }$ extends to $20 \%$ longer than the expiration date of the control. The acceptance criterion was defined as positive reactions for Positive control and negative reactions for Negative control at both $\mathrm { T } _ { \mathrm { z e r o } }$ and $\mathrm { T _ { F i n a l } }$ test points.

Closed stability was determined using an accelerated stability study and the product was predicated to have a 3 year shelf life when stored at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . The product was tested at three elevated temperatures and the shelf stability was predicated using a stability model with activation energy of 20-kCal/mole. Acceptance criterion was defined as positive reactions for Positive control and negative reactions for Negative control at accelerated period of time equivalent to $\geq 3$ years at normal storage conditions.

Real-time stability studies are ongoing. The test vials have been stored at 2- $8 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C }$ and at $- 2 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ (pseudo $\mathrm { T } _ { \mathrm { z e r o . } }$ ) and will be tested at several time points. The qualitative results for each time point will be compared against $\mathrm { T } _ { \mathrm { z e r o } }$ values. Failure is assumed to have taken place when the analyte qualitative results do not indicate a positive reaction for Positive control and negative reaction for negative control.
