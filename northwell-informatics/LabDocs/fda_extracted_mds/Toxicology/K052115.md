II. Date of Preparation of this Summary: July 29, 2005

III. Trade Name: First Check $. ^ { \textregistered }$ Multi Drug Cup 12,

IV. Common Name: Home use drug's of abuse rapid screening test for Marijuana (THC), Cocaine (COC), Ampethamine (AMP), Methamphetamine (MET), Ecstasy (MDMA), Opiates (OPI), Phencyclidine (PCP), Benzodiazepine (BZO), Barbiturates (BAR), Methadone (MTD), Tri-cyclic Antidepressants (TCA) and Oxycodone (OXY) in urine.

V. Classification Name: Immunoassay for the qualitative detection of drugs of abuse in urine.

VI. The Marketed Products to Which Equivalence is Claimed: The First Check $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Multi Drug Cup 12 for Marijuana (THC), Cocaine (COC), Amphetamine (AMP), Methamphetamine (MET), Ecstasy (MDMA), Opiates (OPI), Phencyclidine (PCP), Benzodiazepine (BZO), Barbiturates (BAR), Methadone (MTD), Tricyclic Antidepressants and Oxycodone (OXY), that is the subject of this submission is identical to the Ameditech ImmuTest Drug Screen Cup in terms of product design, performance characteristics, materials of construction and manufacturing process. It is also substantially equivalent to the Accu-Stat Home Drug Test Cup, and other commercially available drug screening tests, that qualitatively measure the presence of target drugs or metabolites by visual color one-step immunoassay technology.

VII. Statement of Intended Use Compared to Other Products: The intended use of the First Check $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Multi Drug Cup 12 for Marijuana (THC), Cocaine (COC), Amphetamine (AMP), Methamphetamine (MET), Ecstasy (MDMA), Opiates

(OPI), Phencyclidine (PCP), Benzodiazepine (BZO), Barbiturates (BAR), Methadone (MTD), Tri-cyclic Antidepressants (TCA) and Oxycodone (OXY) is substantially equivalent to the listed products; it is a preliminary, rapid screening test for the detection of up to twelve of the above listed drugs and their metabolites in urine. This product is intended to be the first step in a two step process to provide consumers, including but not limited to concerned parents, with information regarding the presence of Marijuana (THC), Cocaine (COC), Amphetamine (AMP), Methamphetamine (MET), Ecstasy (MDMA), Opiates (OPI), Phencyclidine (PCP), Benzodiazepine (BZO), Barbiturates (BAR), Methadone (MTD), Tri-cyclic Antidepressants (TCA) and Oxycodone (OXY) anc their metabolites in a urine sample. Information regarding the second step, confirmatory testing, is provided.

There are no uniformly recognized drug levels for Barbiturate (BAR), Benzodiazepine (BZO), Tri-cyclic Antidepressant (TCA) and Oxycodone (OXY) in urine. The Multi Drug Cup 12 shows the drug was or was not present at the cutoff level. The device is intended for home use. The device is not intended for workplace testing.

VIII. Discussion of Technological Characteristics: The First Check $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Multi Drug Cup 12 for Marijuana (THC), Cocaine (COC), Amphetamine (AMP), Methamphetamine (MET), Ecstasy (MDMA), Opiates (OPI), Phencyclidine (PCP), Benzodiazepine (BZO), Barbiturates (BAR), Methadone (MTD), Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCA) and Oxycodone (OXY), like other commercially available drug screening tests, qualitatively detects the presence or absence of the above listed drugs and their metabolites in urine, using a one step, rapid chromatographic immunoassay which operates under the principle of recognition and formation of specific antibody/target drug complexes.

A drug-positive urine specimen will not generate a colored line in the test line region because of drug competition, while a drug-negative urine specimen will generate a line in the test region because of the absence of drug competition. To serve as a procedural control, a colored line will always appear at the control line region if the test has been performed properly. If a control line does not appear for any reason, the results are considered invalid and should not be interpreted. The sample should either be retested using a new First Check Multi Drug Cup 12 or the sample should be mailed in for confirmation.

Examples of predicate devices include the First Check $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Home Drug Tests using a single or multi-drug display and the Accu-Stat Drugs of Abuse Home Test Cup. The analytical studies of the identical Ameditech, Inc ImmuTest Drug Screen Cup (K050186) indicate that the drug test reacts specifically with the above listed drugs and their metabolites. A consumer study using the First Check $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Multi Drug Cup 12 demonstrates that the test exhibits excellent overall performance in the hands of lay users. The data supports the conclusion that the consumer can

use the First Check $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Multi Drug Cup for Marijuana (THC), Cocaine (COC), Amphetamine (AMP), Methamphetamine (MET), Ecstasy (MDMA), Opiates (OPI), Phencyclidine (PCP), Benzodiazepine (BZO), Barbiturates (BAR), Methadone (MTD), Tri-cyclic Antidepressants (TCA) and Oxycodone (OXY) to obtain immediate, preliminary information regarding the possible use of the above listed drugs. The cut-off concentration are as follows: Marijuana at $5 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ Cocaine at $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ , Amphetamine at $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , Methamphetamine at 1000 ng/ml, Ecstasy at 500 ng/ml, Opiates at 2000 ng/ml, Phencyclidine at 25 ng/ml, Benzodiazepine at $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ ,Barbiturates at $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ , Methadone at $3 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ Tri-cyclic Antidepressants at $1 { , } 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ and Oxycodone at $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ .

IX. Safety and Effectiveness: Because the First Check $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Multi Drug Cup 12 for Marijuana (THC), Cocaine (COC), Amphetamine (AMP), Methamphetamine (MET), Ecstasy (MDMA), Opiates (OPI), Phencyclidine (PCP), Benzodiazepines (BZO), Barbiturates (BAR), Methadone (MTD), Tri-cyclic Antidepressants (TCA) and Oxycodone (OXY) is identical to the Ameditech ImmuTest Drug Screen Cup Test that is legally marketed under K050186, and because no special skills, training, education, or licensure are required to collect a urine sample and activate the test, there is no issue regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product to perform its intended function, i.e., to screen urine for the presence or absence of THC, COC, AMP, MET, MDMA, OPI, PCP, BZO, BAR, MTD, TCA, OXY and their metabolite(s).

Because the labeling of the First Check $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Multi Drug Cup 12 for Marijuana (THC), Cocaine (COC), Amphetamine (AMP), Methamphetamine (MET), Ecstasy (MDMA), Opiates (OPI), Phencyclidine (PCP), Benzodiazepines (BZO), Barbiturates (BAR), Methadone (MTD), Tri-cyclic Antidepressants (TCA) and Oxycodone (OxY) is substantially equivalent to a variety of rapid screening tests currently in commercial distribution, including the First Check Home Drug Test Kit, the Phamatech At HomeTM Drug Test Cup and the Accu-Stat Home Drug Test Cup, and there have been no reports of consumer inability to follow instructions or interpret results over the many years in which these products have been purchased by the general public, it should be concluded that the product can be used effectively by the lay user.

The designated cut-off concentrations of these drugs are as follows: Marijuana at 50 ng/mL, Cocaine at 300 ng/mL, Amphetamine at 1000 ng/mL, Methamphetamine at 1000 ng/mL, Ecstasy at 500 ng/mL, Opiates at 2000 ng/mL, Phencyclidine at 25 ng/mL, Benzodiazepine at 300 ng/mL, Barbiturates at 300 ng/mL, Methadone at 300 ng/mL, Tri-cyclic Antidepressants at 1,000 ng/mL and Oxycodone at 100 ng/mL.

# Special condition for use statement:

The BAR, BZO, TCA, OXY assay will yield preliminary positive results when BAR, BZO, TCA and OXY is ingested at or above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly recognized drug levels for barbiturate, benzodiazepine, tricyclic antidepressant and oxycodone in urine. The Multi Drug Cup 12 shows the drug was or was not present at the cutoff level.

This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method for most drugs (HPLC is the preferred confirmatory method for Tri-cyclic Antidepressants). Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.

This device is not intended for workplace testing. This device is intended for Home Use.

The test is intended for over-the-counter (OTC) consumer use as the first step in a two step process to provide consumers, including but not limited to concerned parents, with information concerning the presence or absence of the above stated drugs or their metabolites in a urine sample. Information regarding confirmatory testing  the second step in the process, along with the materials for shipping the urine specimen to the laboratory, is provided.
