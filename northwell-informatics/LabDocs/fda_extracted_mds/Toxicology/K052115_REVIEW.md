# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): Refer to the Indications for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use: The First Check $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Multi Drug Cup 12 for Marijuana (THC), Cocaine (COC), Amphetamine (AMP), Methamphetamine (MET), Ecstasy (MDMA), Opiates (OPI), Phencyclidine (PCP), Benzodiazepine (BZO), Barbiturates (BAR), Methadone (MTD), Tri-cyclic Antidepressants (TCA) and Oxycodone (OXY) is a screening test for the rapid detection of the twelve drugs listed above in human urine. The designated cut-off concentrations of these drugs are as follows: Marijuana at $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , Cocaine at $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , Amphetamine at $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , Methamphetamine at $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , Ecstasy at $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , Opiates at $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , Phencyclidine at $2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , Benzodiazepine at 300 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ , Barbiturates at $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , Methadone at $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , Tri-cyclic Antidepressants at $1 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and Oxycodone at $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

The BAR, BZO, TCA, OXY assay will yield preliminary positive results when BAR, BZO, TCA and OXY is ingested at or above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly recognized drug levels for barbiturate, benzodiazepine, tricyclic antidepressant and oxycodone in urine. The Multi Drug Cup 12 shows the drug was or was not present at the cutoff level. This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method for most drugs (HPLC is the preferred confirmatory method for Tri-cyclic Antidepressants). Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.

This device is not intended for workplace testing.

The test is intended for over-the-counter (OTC) consumer use as the first step in a two step process to provide consumers, including but not limited to concerned parents, with information concerning the presence or absence of the above stated drugs or their metabolites in a urine sample. Information regarding confirmatory testing – the second step in the process, along with the materials for shipping the urine specimen to the laboratory, is provided.

3. Special condition for use statement(s): The BAR, BZO, TCA, OXY assay will yield preliminary positive results when BAR, BZO, TCA and OXY is ingested at or above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly recognized drug levels for barbiturate,

benzodiazepine, tricyclic antidepressant and oxycodone in urine. The Multi Drug Cup 12 shows the drug was or was not present at the cutoff level.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

The sponsor did not reference any standards or guidance documents in their premarket submission.

# L. Test Principle:

This device uses a one step, rapid chromatographic immunoassay which operates under the principle of competitive binding. The device contains a nitrocellulose membrane strip pre-coated with drug-protein conjugate (or antibody) band in the test region and a pad containing colored antibody (or the drug-protein) colloidal gold conjugate. A drug-positive urine specimen will not generate a colored line in the test line region because of drug competition, while a drug-negative urine specimen will generate a line in the test region because of the absence of drug competition. To serve as a procedural control, a colored line will always appear at the control line region if the test has been performed properly. If a control line does not appear for any reason, the results are considered invalid and should not be interpreted. The sample should either be retested using a new device or the sample should be mailed in for confirmation.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: See Clinical studies section below to see performance data for samples around the cutoff.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

The device has an internal process control. Users are informed that the control indicates that sufficient urine was added to the test. This is typical of OTC tests. Users are also informed not to interpret the test if the control line does not form.

Performance Characteristics have been addressed in k050186 (Ameditech Immutest Drug Screen Cup).

e. Analytical specificity: Performance Characteristics have been addressed in k050186 (Ameditech Immutest Drug Screen Cup).

f. Analytical specificity: Performance Characteristics have been addressed in k050186 (Ameditech Immutest Drug Screen Cup).

g. Assay cut-off:

The cutoff concentrations for methamphetamine, THC, cocaine metabolites, amphetamines, opiates and PCP are recommended by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).

SAMHSA has not recommended a cutoff concentration for barbiturates, benzodiazepines, methadone, tricyclic antidepressants, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, and oxycodone. The cutoff concentrations for these drugs are the same as the cutoff concentrations in k050186, the predicate device.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Performance Characteristics have been addressed in k050186 (Ameditech Immutest Drug Screen Cup)

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable.

3. Clinical studies: a. Clinical sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a and b are not applicable): A consumer study was conducted to determine the device’s performance when used by untrained users following the instructions in the labeling. A questionnaire was used to determine if the untrained users understood the purpose of the test, the conditions for its use, the test’s limitations, and the meaning of the results. 250 untrained users read a total of 5,760 assays during the study and 5,731 of 5,760 assays $( 9 9 . 5 \% )$ was interpreted correctly. 480 unique tests with sample solutions containing benzoylecgonine, morphine, secobarbital, oxazepam, THC, nortriptyline, phencyclidine, methadone, MDMA, amphetamine, and oxycodone were performed by consumers using drug-free urine spiked with various concentrations and combinations of drugs. Each drug was tested at $0 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $7 5 \%$ , $12 5 \%$ , $1 5 0 \%$ , and $20 \%$ of the target concentration. Drug concentrations except for TCA were confirmed by GC/MS at a SAMHSA laboratory; recovery ranged between 85.3 to $1 3 8 . 0 \%$ of the target concentration. TCA was confirmed by HPLC at an independent laboratory; recovery ranged between 84.3 to $1 2 1 . 2 \%$ of the target concentration. Approximately $6 . 9 \%$ of the consumers had used a home drug kit. $1 0 . 7 \%$ had not finished high school; $4 2 . 6 \%$ were high school graduates; $3 4 . 3 \%$ had completed one year of college; and $12 / 4 \%$ of the lay users were college graduates. The ratio of female to male was approximately 2:1. The ages ranged from 18 to over 45 years. The study was conducted at three different locations (Phoenix, AZ; Johnson City, NY; and Bemidji, MN)

The results of the study are summarized below:

\*Twenty-six of twenty-nine incorrectly interpreted results that were at target concentrations of $\pm 2 5 \%$ (either $7 5 \%$ or $12 5 \%$ of the cutoff). Three of twenty-nine incorrectly interpreted results (amphetamines, opiates and methadone) that were at $- 5 0 \%$ of the cutoff.

250 consumers were recruited. A consumer questionnaire was administered to evaluate their experience with home drug tests and labeling effectiveness. The following questions were asked: “Have you purchased a home drug test?” Have you previously used a home drug test?” “Was the test easy to run and were the results easy to read?” “Does it matter how light or dark the colored line is?” “If a sample tests positive for a prescription drug like TCA, does that mean for certain that an individual is abusing that prescription drug?” $2 . 8 \%$ of the participants had purchased a home drug test. $6 . 8 \%$ previously used a home drug test. $9 5 . 2 \%$ of the participants said the test was easy to run and the results were easy to read. $9 0 . 6 \%$ correctly stated that it does not matter how dark or light a colored line is. $9 4 . 7 \%$ said if a sample tests positive for a prescription drug it does not mean for certain that an individual is abusing that prescription drug.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range: Not applicable.

N. Proposed Labeling: The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
