1. Identification of the Device: Proprietary-Trade Name: Connectables® Alcohol Tester Classification Name: Device, breath trapping, alcohol, DJZ Common/Usual Name: Breath-alcohol test system

2. Equivalent legally marketed device: Alcohawk Precision, K043188

3.Indications for Use (intended use) : This device is intended to measure alcohol in the human breath. Measurements obtained by this device are used as an aid in the detection of alcohol intoxication.

4.Description of the Device: The Connectables $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Alcohol Tester is designed to measure deep lung air to test for the presence of alcohol in the blood. The relationship between alcohol in the blood and alcohol in the deep lung breath is well established by Henry's law in ratio of 2100:1. The Connectables $^ { \textregistered }$ Alcohol Tester is an alcohol screening device and uses a blow time of 3 seconds to capture an accurate deep lung sample. The Connectables $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ EPY Alcohol Tester contains a semiconductor sensor designed to test for the presence of alcohol. The semiconductor material is heated to a specific temperature. The resistance of sensing material changes rapidly according to gas concentration changes, thereby enabling the reading of alcohol concentration by resistance measurement.

5.Safety and Effectiveness, comparison to predicate device. The results of bench, and user testing indicates that the new device is as safe and effective as the predicate device. A clinical trial was performed to establish that the user could read and understand the instructions provided, and properly use the device.

# 7. Conclusion

After analyzing bench tests, a risk analysis, electrical safety, and user testing data, it is the conclusion of Connectables $^ \mathrm { ( \tilde { R } ) }$ , LLC that the Connectables $^ { \textregistered }$ Alcohol Tester is as safe and effective as the predicate device, has few technological differences, and has no new indications for use, thus rendering it substantially equivalent to the predicate device. The clinical trial performed showed that the over the counter purchaser of this device could read and understand the instructions, could properly use the device, and obtain results that were comparable to those provided by a predicate unit administered by a trained observer.

Dear Mr. Adams:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484.
