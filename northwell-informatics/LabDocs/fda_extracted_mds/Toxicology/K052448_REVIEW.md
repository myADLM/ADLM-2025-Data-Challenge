# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

The sponsor states conformance to the following standards:

1. EN 55022: 1998, Information Technology Equipment - Radio Disturbance Characteristics - Limits and Methods of Measurement-Includes Amendment A1:2000   
2. EN 61000-4-2: 1995+A1: 1998+A2: 2001, Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) - Part 4-2 : Testing and measurement techniques - Electrostatic discharge immunity test

# L. Test Principle:

The Alcohol Tester (PB2000) is designed to measure deep lung air to test for the presence of alcohol in the blood. The relationship between alcohol concentration in deep lung air and blood is established by Henry’s Law in a ratio of 1:2100. The tin dioxide semiconductor gas sensor is sensitive to changes in conductivity due to the presence of alcohol in the breath. This change in conductivity due to the alcohol can be quantitated and converted to $\%$ concentration of alcohol.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The Connectables’ device was not eligible for testing by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (Department of Transportation). In lieu of NHTSA testing, the sponsor collected performance data to support a claim of substantial equivalence for the device.

# 1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: The sponsor performed precision and accuracy testing for three BACs using a Breath Alcohol Sample Simulator (BASS), which provides an alcohol-in-air test sample with known alcohol concentrations, flow rate, and air composition.

The sponsor performed 20 tests at $0 . 0 2 \%$ BAC, 20 at $0 . 0 6 \%$ BAC, and 20 at $0 . 0 1 0 \%$ BAC. Summary results were as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentration</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Green (lessthan 0.04%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Yellow (0.04to 0.08%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Red (greaterthan 0.08%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.02%BAC</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.06%BAC</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.10%BAC</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20</td></tr></table>

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Since this device reports a range and not an actual concentration, it is not possible to evaluate linearity.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): This device is traceable to a commercially available certified alcohol reference solution at a concentration of $0 . 0 6 \%$ BAC. This solution is used to calibrate the devices when manufactured.

d. Detection limit:

The NHTSA guidelines do not specifically address the detection limit of breath alcohol device but require testing at a $\%$ BAC of zero (blank reading) to assess the possibility of false positives. The sponsor tested twenty “zero” concentration samples using non-alcoholic human breath. No false positives were produced using these samples.

e. Analytical specificity:

The sponsor evaluated the possibility of cigarette smoke interference with the device. An alcohol-free individual was asked to smoke approximately one half of a cigarette. Within one minute after smoking, the subject took a breath alcohol reading. The subject then smoked another inhalation and repeated the test to produce a total of five trials. Overall, the study involved two participants and two different cigarette brands for a total of 200 measurements. The Connectables device produced no false positives in this experiment. Other potential interferents were not evaluated with this device.

# $f .$ Temperature

The sponsor assessed the effect of temperature at 10 and $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Twenty different devices were tested at each temperature. The concentrations chosen for testing were 0.02, 0.06, and $0 . 1 0 \%$ BAC. According to the User’s Manual, if the device has been inactive for more than 24 hours, the user should take three readings and disregard the first two. Only the third reading should be used. When this instruction was followed, the following results were obtained:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Temperature</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentration (%BAC)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Green/Yellow/Red</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>40° C</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.02</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20/0/0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>40° C</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.06</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0/20/0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>40° C</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0/0/20</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10° C</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.02</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20/0/0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10° C</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.06</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0/20/0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10° C</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0/0/20</td></tr></table>

# g. Vibration/Drop Testing

The sponsor performed vibration testing per NHTSA specifications at concentrations of 0.02, 0.06, and $0 . 1 0 \%$ BAC. Twenty separate devices were used for each trial. Trial A involved vibrating the devices through a frequency range of 10 to $3 0 \mathrm { H z }$ at an amplitude of $3 . 0 \mathrm { m m }$ . Results were as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentrationn (%BAC)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Green/Yellow/Red</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.02</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20/0/0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.06</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0/20/0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0/0/20</td></tr></table>

Trial B involved vibrating the devices through a frequency range of 30 to 60 $\mathrm { H z }$ at an amplitude of $1 . 5 \mathrm { m m }$ . Results were as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentration(%BAC)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Green/Yellow/Red</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.02</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20/0/0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.06</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0/20/0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0/0/20</td></tr></table>

h. Assay cut-off:

The colored lights on the Breathalyzer (PB1000) and Alcohol Tester (PB2000) are interpreted as follows:

No lights illuminated: Battery low Green light illuminated: BAC is less than $0 . 0 4 \%$ Yellow light illuminated: BAC is in the range of 0.04 to $0 . 0 8 \%$ Red light illuminated: BAC is greater than $0 . 0 8 \%$

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: The sponsor conducted a consumer study comparing the Alcohol Tester PB2000 to the predicate device. The purpose of the study was to determine if consumers could correctly operate and interpret the device using only the supplied User’s Manual, and to compare the results to the predicate device. There were 27 paired comparisons, and the reported age range of the volunteers was from 21 to 56 years of age. There were 18 men and 9 women who participated in the trial. Each participant took their own breath alcohol reading with the Alcohol Tester and recorded the result. Immediately afterward, the participants provided another breath sample, which was analyzed using the predicate device operated by a trained individual. The breath alcohol concentrations ranged from a BAC of $0 . 0 0 \%$ to $0 . 3 5 \%$ by the predicate device.

Based on the interpretation chart in the labeling, 21 out of 27 samples produced a concentration range on the Alcohol Tester that included the specific concentration measured by the predicate. For 5 samples the Connectables device gave a concentration range lower than the predicate device result. For 1 sample, the Connectables device gave a concentration range higher than the predicate. The six discrepant results are presented in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Connectables Result</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Predicate DeviceResult</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Connectables vs.predicate</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Yellow</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.09</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lower</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Yellow</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.09</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lower</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Yellow</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.12</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lower</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Yellow</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lower</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Yellow</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.09</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lower</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Red</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.08</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Higher</td></tr></table>

After the study, participants were asked questions about the ease of use of the device:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Question</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ParticipantsRespondingStronglyDisagree</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Disagree</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>NeitherAgree norDisagree</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Agree</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>StronglyAgree</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>I found thedevice easy touse</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>22</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>I understoodthe instructionsand how tointerpret theresults</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>21</td></tr></table>
