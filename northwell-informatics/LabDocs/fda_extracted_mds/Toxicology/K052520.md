# Predicate Devices:

# Device Description:

New Bay For Sure One Step single and Multiple Drug Screen Test card consists of a chromatographic absorbent device in which the drug or drug metabolites in the sample compete with a drug conjugate immobilized on a porous membrane support for the limited antibody sites. As the test sample flows through the absorbent device, the Colloidal Gold labeled antibody- conjugate binds to the free drug in the specimen forming an antibodyantigen complex. This complex competes with immobilized antigen conjugate in the Test reaction zone and will not produce a magenta color band when the drug is above the detection level of 1000 ng/ml of Amphetamine, 1000 ng/ml of Methamphetamine, 50 ng of THC, 2000ng/ml of Morphine,300 ng of Benzoylecognine 25 ng/ml of Phencyclidine. Unbound colloidal gold-labeled antibody conjugate binds to the reagent in the negative control zone, producing a magenta color band, demonstrating that the reagents and device are functioning correctly. A NEGATIVE specimen produces two distinct color bands in both the specific drug test region and control area. A POSITIVE specimen produces only one color band in the control area and no color band on the specific drug test region . There is no meaning attributed to color or its intensity for either line. To serve as a procedural control, a colored line will always appear at the control line region, indicating that proper volume of specimen has been added and membrane wicking has occurred.

# Intended Use:

The Forsure One step single and Multiple Drug screen Amphetamine, THC, Morphine, Methamphetamine, Benzoylecognine and Phencyclidine Cassette Test are a Chromatographic immunoassay for qualitative determination of the presence of Amphetamine at a cutoff concentration of 1000 ng/ml, Methamphetamine at a cutoff concentration of 1000 ng/ml, THC at a cutoff concentration of $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n } _ { \mathrm { { l } } } \mathrm { { g } / \mathrm { { m } } ! }$ , Morphine at a cutoff concentration of 2000 $\mathbf { n g / m l }$ Benzoylecgonine at a cutoff concentration of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ , Phencyclidine at a cutoff concentration of 25 ng/ml. The assay provides a simple and rapid analytical screening procedure to detect Amphetamine, THC, Morphine, Methamphetamine, Benzoylecognine and Phencyclidine in human urine. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatogrphy/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method.

# Comparison to Predicate Device(s):

Forsure Multiple Rapid One Step Drug Screen Test is substantially equivalent to Branan's Monitect Drug Screen Cassette Test system cleared by FDA, e.g., the Brana's Monitect Assay (004034 )and GC/MS for its stated intended use.

Dear Mr. Berlie:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determincd the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug. and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA). it may be subject to such additional controls.

# Indications for Use

510(k) Number (if known): k052520

# Device Name:

Forsure One Step Multiple (Up to Six) Drug Screen Test Card for Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Bezoylecgonine, 11-nor-Δ-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid, Morphine and Phencyclidine.

# Indications for Use:

Forsure One Step Multiple (Up to Six) Drug Screen Test Card is a prescription assay intended for professional use in central laboratories only. It provides qualitative screening results for Amphetamine (AMP), Methamphetamine (MET), Bezoylecgonine (BEG/COC), 11-nor- $\cdot \Delta$ -g-Tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid (THC), Morphine (MOR/OPl) and Phencyclidine (PCP) in human urine at cut off concentrations of AMP 1000 ng/ml, MET 1000 ng/ml, BEG 300 ng/ml, THC 50ng/ml, MOR 2000 ng/ml and PCP 25ng/ml. The device may include as few as one and as many as six individual assays. For In Vitro Diagnostic Use.

This assay provides only a preliminary result. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drugs of abuse test result, particularly in evaluating a preliminary positive. To obtain a confirmed analytical result, a more specific alternate chemical method is needed. Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) is the recommended confirmatory method.
