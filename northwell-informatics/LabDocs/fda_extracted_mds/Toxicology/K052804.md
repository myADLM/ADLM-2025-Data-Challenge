# Common Name

Device, Breath Trapping Alcohol Medical Specialty: Toxicology Product Code: DJZ 21 CFR: 862.3050

Predicate Device(s) AlcoMate CA2000 Digital Alcohol Detector manufactured by KHN Solutions LLC 510(k) Premarket Notification number: K041334 FDA Product Code: DJZ

Intoxilyzer S-D5, manufactured by CMI, Inc DOT approved device 69 FR 42237 (See Appendix 1.0)

Device Description The OmegaPoint Systems BreathKeyT Model g10 and BreathKeyT Model g30X Personal Breath Alcohol Testers are designed to measure deep lung air to determine the level of alcohol in the blood. BreathKey Model $\mathbf { g } 3 \mathbf { 0 } \mathbf { X }$ is identical to Model g10 except that Model $\mathbf { g 3 0 X }$ transmits the Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) results by way of a radio frequency signal to an interlock receiver installed in a motor vehicle.

The alcohol sensor is of the electrochemical fuel cell type. As the user's breath moves through the sensor, the sensor generates an electrical current that is proportional to the concentration of ethanol in the breath.

Dear Mr. Degenhardt:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484.
