# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

The sponsor states conformance to the following standard:

CLSI EP10-A2, Preliminary Evaluation of Quantitative Clinical Laboratory Methods; Approved Guideline – Second Edition

# L. Test Principle:

The sensor has two electrodes in which platinum is fixed to a porous substrate. The porous substrate operates as a gas permeable membrane and structural support for the electrode. The electrodes are located on the inside surface of the membrane where they make contact with sulfuric acid as an electrolyte. When ethanol from a deep lung air sample diffuses through the porous membrane to reach the working electrode, the ethanol is oxidized or reduced at the interface of the working electrode and the electrolyte. That reaction generates an electrical current that is proportional to the concentration of the ethanol.

The amplifier on the circuit board of the device converts the electrical current from the alcohol sensor into a voltage, and then sends the voltage to the microprocessor. The microprocessor converts this voltage into a number that the internal software can then use as a basis for the calculation of the blood alcohol concentration (BAC). Once the BAC is calculated, the microprocessor sends the BAC value to the LCD display.

This device uses an algorithm to convert deep lung breath alcohol concentration to blood alcohol concentration according to the relationship established by Henry’s Law.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The $\mathtt { g l 0 }$ and $\mathrm { g } 3 0 X$ devices were not eligible for testing by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In lieu of NHTSA testing, the sponsor collected performance data to support a claim of substantial equivalence for the devices.

# 1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: The sponsor performed precision and accuracy testing using a Breath Alcohol Sample Simulator (BASS), which provides an alcohol-in-air test sample with known alcohol concentrations, flow rate, and air composition.

# g10 model

The sponsor performed 20 tests at $0 . 0 0 \%$ BAC, 20 at $0 . 0 2 \%$ BAC, and 20 at $0 . 0 8 \%$ BAC. Summary results were as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>BASS Concentration (% BAC)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.00</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.02</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.08</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Number of Replicates</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.00</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.020</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.084</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Standard Deviation</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.00</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.004</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.005</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Coefficient of Variation (%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>18.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.6</td></tr></table>

The sponsor performed a more extensive study based on CLSI guideline EP10-A2. Summary results were as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>BASS Concentration (% BAC)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.00</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.02</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.08</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Number of Replicates</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.000</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.018</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.072</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Standard Deviation</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.00</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.002</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.007</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Coefficient of Variation (%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9.2</td></tr></table>

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

This device will report concentrations from 0.00 to $0 . 2 0 \%$ BAC. Since accuracy and precision testing was conducted at concentrations of 0.00, 0.020, and 0.080 only, true linearity was not evaluated.

c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):

This device is traceable to a commercially available certified alcohol reference solution at a concentration of $0 . 0 8 \%$ BAC. This solution is used to calibrate the devices during manufacture.

# d. Detection limit:

The NHTSA guidelines do not specifically address the detection limit of breath alcohol device but require testing at a $\% \mathrm { B A C }$ of zero (blank reading) to assess the possibility of false positives. The sponsor included a zero concentration sample in their precision studies above. Non-alcoholic human breath was used as the sample. Neither model produced any false positives when measuring zero concentration samples.

# e. Analytical specificity:

The sponsor evaluated the possibility of cigarette smoke interference with the device. An alcohol-free individual was asked to smoke approximately one half of a cigarette. Within one minute after smoking, the subject took a breath alcohol reading. The subject then smoked another inhalation and repeated the test to produce a total of five trials. The OmegaPoint device had no positive results.

Other potential interferents were not evaluated with this device.

# $f .$ Temperature:

The sponsor assessed the effect of temperatures over the operating range (10 to $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) of the devices. (If the device is powered on at a temperature outside the operating range, an error code “HOT” or “COLD” will be displayed and the device will not operate.) Ten different devices were tested at each temperature. All testing was done at a BAC of $0 . 0 8 \%$ . Summary results were as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Temperature ()</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>30</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>40</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Number of Replicates</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.088</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.077</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.075</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.072</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Standard Deviation</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.009</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.007</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.010</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.009</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Coefficient of Variation(%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>13.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>13.5</td></tr></table>

# g. Vibration/Drop Testing:

Drop testing was performed on the $\mathtt { g l 0 }$ model at a BAC of $0 . 0 8 \%$ . Prior to testing, the device was dropped 10 times from a height of 5 feet onto a hard surface. After the 10 drops, 10 readings were taken. Summary results were as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.082</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Standard Deviation</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.006</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Coefficient of Variation (%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.4</td></tr></table>

Drop testing was not performed separately on the $\mathrm { g } 3 0 \mathrm { X }$ model.

h. Assay Cutoff:

In their labeling, the sponsor states that drivers may be impaired at a BAC of $0 . 0 4 \%$ or even lower and that it is never safe to drink any amount of alcohol and drive.

The $\mathrm { g } 3 0 X$ model can be used in conjunction with a remote receiver (interlock device) that is intended to control the ignition of a motor vehicle. The cutoff concentration is set by the interlock device. The sponsor states that the cutoff concentration will be set at $0 . 0 2 \%$ BAC.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The accuracy of this device is addressed in the precision section above. In addition, the sponsor conducted a method comparison study comparing the Model $\mathtt { g l 0 }$ to a professional breath alcohol device. The purpose of the study was to determine if the participants could operate the device correctly and interpret the results using only the supplied Operation Manual, and to compare the results to the professional device. There were 5 participants and a total of 9 paired comparisons Each participant took their own breath alcohol reading with the Model $\mathtt { g l 0 }$ and recorded the result. Immediately afterward, the participants were administered a breath alcohol test using an Intoximeter S-D5 operated by a trained individual. The breath alcohol concentrations ranged from a BAC of 0.000 to 0.066 (by the professional device). Simple linear regression analysis of the data shows a slope of 0.99, a y-intercept of 0.00, and a correlation coefficient of 0.99.

The sponsor also conducted a usability and readability study in which participants were asked to use the device and read the Operation Manual prior to filing out a questionnaire. There were 51 participants including the 5 participants who provided a breath sample above. The results are presented below:
