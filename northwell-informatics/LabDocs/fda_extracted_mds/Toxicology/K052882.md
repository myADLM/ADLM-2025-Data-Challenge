# Predicate Devices:

Rapid One Step Single and Multiple (X) Abuse Drug ScreenTest Cup Device is substantially equivalent to Monitect Multiple Drug Screen Test of Branan Medical Corporation, cleared by FDA( K004034), or Alfa Scientific Design Instant-View Propoxyphene (PPX) urine test cleared by FDA ( K022915 )and GC/MS for its stated intended use.

# Device Description:

New Bay Forsure Rapid One Step Single and Multiple(X) Abuse Drug Screen Test Cup Device consists of a or multiple chromatographic absorbent strip in which the drug or drug metabolites in the sample compete with a drug conjugate immobilized on a porous membrane support for the limited antibody sites. As the test sample flows through the absorbent strip, the Colloidal Gold labeled antibody- conjugate binds to the free drug in the specimen forming an antibody-antigen complex. This complex competes with immobilized antigen conjugate in the Test reaction zone and will not produce a magenta color band when the drug is above the detection level of $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ of Amphetamine, $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ of Methamphetamine, $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g }$ of THC, $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ of Morphine, $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g }$ of Benzoylecognine , $2 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ of Phencyclidine, 300 $\mathrm { n g / m l }$ of Benzodiazepine, $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ of Methadone , $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ of Oxycodone , $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ of Tricyclic Antidepressant, $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ of Barbiturates and $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ of Propoxyphene. Unbound colloidal gold-labeled antibody conjugate binds to the reagent in the negative control zone, producing a magenta color band, demonstrating that the reagents and device are functioning correctly. A NEGATIVE specimen produces two distinct color bands in both the specific drug test region and control area. A POsITIVE specimen produces only one color band in the control area and no color band on the specific drug test region . There is no meaning attributed to color or its intensity for either line. To serve as a procedural control, a colored line will always appear at the control line region, indicating that proper volume of specimen has been added and membrane wicking has occurred.

# Intended Use:

The Forsure One Step Single or Multiple (X) Drug Screen Strip of Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Benzoylecgonine, Benzodiazepine, Marijuana, Morphine, Phencyclidine, Methadone , Oxycodone , Tricyclic Antidepressant, Barbiturates and Propoxyphene Test device are a Chromatographic immunoassay for qualitativedetermination of the presence of Amphetamine at a cutoff concentration of $\mathrm { { 1 0 0 0 n g / m l } } .$ Methamphetamine at a cutoff concentration of $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { \mathbf { n g / m l } }$ , THC at a cutoff concentration of $5 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , Morphine at a cutoff concentration of $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , Benzoylecgonine at a cutoff concentration of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ Phencyclidine at a cutoff concentration of $2 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m } \mathrm { { i } } }$ , Benzodiazepine at cutoff concentration of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ , Methadone at cutoff concentration of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ , Oxycodone at cutoff concentration of $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ Tricyclic Antidepressant at cutoff concentration of $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , Barbiturates at cutoff concentration of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ , and Propoxyphene at cutoff concentration of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ The assay provides a simple and rapid analytical screening procedure to detect Amphetamine, THC, Morphine, Methamphetamine, Benzoylecognine, Phencyclidine, Benzodiazepine, Methadone , Oxycodone , Tricyclic Antidepressant, Barbiturates and Propoxyphene in human urine. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatogrphy/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method.

# Comparison to Predicate Device(s):

Forsure Multiple Rapid One Step Drug Screen Test is substantially equivalent to Branan's Monitect Drug Screen Cassette Test system cleared by FDA, e.g., the Brana's Monitect Assay (004034 )and GC/MS for its stated intended use.

Dear Mr. Berlie:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
