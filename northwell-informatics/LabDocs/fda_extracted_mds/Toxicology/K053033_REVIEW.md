4. Panel: 91, Toxicology

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indications for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use:

Acro Rapid Methamphetamine Urine Test is a lateral flow, rapid immunoassay for the qualitative detection of Methamphetamine in human urine at a cutoff of $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . The test is used to obtain a visual qualitative result and is intended for laboratory use only.

This assay provides only preliminary result. Clinical consideration and professional judgment must be applied to a drug test result, particularly in evaluating a preliminary positive result. In order to obtain a confirmed analytical result, a more specific alternate chemical method is needed. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy (GC/MS) analysis is preferred.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use

4. Special instrument requirements: Not applicable, the device is a visually-read single-use device

I. Device Description: The device consists of a strip within a cassette. (See Test Principle, below.)

# J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

1. Predicate device name(s): Ameditech Immutest Drug Screen Methamphetamine

2. Predicate 510(k) number(s): k012585

3. Comparison with predicate:

The intended use and general methodology is similar for both devices. The cutoff concentration is lower for this device $\mathrm { \Delta } 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { \mathrm { n g / m L } ) }$ ) than for the predicate device $\mathrm { 1 0 0 0 n g / m L ) }$ ).

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced

# L. Test Principle:

The Acro Rapid Methamphetamine Urine Test is based on the principle of competitive immunochemical reaction between an immobilized drug-protein conjugate and the drug or drug metabolites, which may be present in the urine sample for limited binding sites of a labeled antibody. The test contains a nitrocellulose membrane strip pre-coated with drug-protein conjugate in the test region and a wicking pad containing colored antibody-colloidal gold conjugate. During the test, the urine sample migrates on the strip and hydrates the antibody-colloidal gold conjugate. The mixture then migrates along the membrane chromatographically by capillary action to the immobilized drug-protein band in the test region. When drug is absent in the urine, the colored antibody-colloidal gold conjugate and immobilized drug-protein bind specifically to form a visible line in the test region (test line). When methamphetamine is present in the urine sample, it will compete with the drugprotein for the limited antibody binding sites. When the drug is present in sufficient concentration in the urine sample, it will fill the limited antibody binding sites, which will inhibit attachment of the colored antibody-colloidal gold conjugate to the drugprotein conjugate in the test region. Therefore the presence of the test line indicates a negative result for methamphetamine and the absence of the test line indicates a preliminary positive result for methamphetamine.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The reproducibility of the device was evaluated at multiple biotech company sites, and one hospital site. Each site tested the device against masked urine control samples containing 0, 250, 375, 625, 750 and $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ Methamphetamine. Similar performance was observed at the various sites. Composite results are shown below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable. The assay is intended for qualitative use.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Procedural controls are included in the test strip of the device. A line appearing in the control region confirms that sufficient specimen volume was added to the device.

External control materials are not supplied with this test; however the labeling includes a recommendation that external positive and negative controls be tested to ensure proper kit performance. Users should follow local, state and federal guidelines for testing QC material.

d. Detection limit:

See Precision/Reproducibility (section 1a), above.

e. Analytical specificity:

The following compounds were serially diluted 1:1 and added to methamphetamine-negative urine. They produced positive results with the Acro Rapid Methamphetamine Urine Test at the concentrations indicated in the table below:
