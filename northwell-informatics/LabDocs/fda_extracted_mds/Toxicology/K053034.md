# II. FDA INDICATIONS FOR USE FORM 510(K) NUMBER (IF KNOWN) k053034

Device Name: Acro Rapid THC (Marijuana) Urine Test

# Indications for Use

Acro Rapid THC (Marijuana) Urine Test is a lateral flow, one-step immunoassay for the qualitative detection of Tetrahydrocannabinol (Marijuana) in human urine at a cutoff of $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ The test is used to obtain a visual qualitative result and is intended for laboratory use only.

This assay provides only a preliminary result. Clinical consideration and professional judgment must be applied to a drug test result, particularly in evaluating a preliminary positive result. In order to obtain a confirmed analytical result, a more specific alternate chemical method is needed. Gas Chromatography/ Mass Spectroscopy (GC/MS) analysis is preferred.
