2. Device Name / Classification

Dimension® CSAE Cyclosporine Extended Range Calibrator / Class II

# 3. Identification of the Predicate Device

Dimension® CSAE Cyclosporine Extended Range Calibrator, K052015

# 4. Device Description

The Dimension® CSAE Cyclosporine Extended Range Calibrator contains cyclosporine in a preserved whole blood hemolysate. The kit consists of one vial of each calibrator level 0-5. The target concentrations of the calibrator levels are approximately 0, 200, 400, 800, 1400 and $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ of cyclosporine.

Level 0 is used for dilution of over-range samples (>2000 ng/mL) in order to obtain results within the assay range; it is not used in calibration. Levels 1 through 5 are used for calibration of the CSAE Cyclosporine Extended range method for the Dimension® clinical chemistry system or the Syva $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Emit $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2000 Cyclosporine Specific Assay.

# 5. Device Intended Use

The Dimension® CSAE Cyclosporine Extended Range Calibrator is an in vitro diagnostic product intended to be used to calibrate the Cyclosporine A, Extended Range (CSAE) method for the Dimension® clinical chemistry system or the Syva® Emit® 2000 Cyclosporine Specific Assay.

# 6. Medical device to which equivalence is claimed and comparison information

The Dimension® CSAE Cyclosporine Extended Range Calibrator is equivalent to the calibrator previously cleared under K052015. The intended use of this product has been modified to include use of the calibrator with the Emit® 2000 Cyclosporine Specific Assay. No changes were made to the formulation or operating principle to allow its use with the Emit® 2000 Cyclosporine Specific Assay. The Dimension® CSAE Cyclosporine Extended Range Calibrator with the modified intended use is substantially equivalent to the cleared Dimension® CSAE Cyclosporine Extended Range Calibrator (K052015).

Dear Ms. Lewis:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484.
