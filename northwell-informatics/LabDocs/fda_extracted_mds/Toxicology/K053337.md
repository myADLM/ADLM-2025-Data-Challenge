# Dade Behring Inc. 510(k) Premarket Notification - Dimension® Urine Ecstasy Screen Flex® reagent cartridge

# 5. Device Intended Use

The EXTC Flex $\mathfrak { W }$ reagent cartridge used on the Dimension® clinical chemistry system provides reagents for an in vitro diagnostic test intended for the qualitative and semiquantitative determination of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and closely related drugs in human urine using a cutoff of either 300 or ${ 5 0 0 } \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Measurements obtained with the EXTC method are used in the diagnosis and treatment of ecstasy use or overdose.

The EXTC method provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Other chemical confirmation methods are available. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.

6. Medical device to which equivalence is claimed and comparison information

The EXTC Flex reagent cartridge is substantially equivalent in intended use and methodology to the Emit® II Plus Ecstasy Assay (K043028). Both devices are enzyme immunoassays intended for use in the qualitative and semiquantitative determination of ecstasy drugs in human urine. Both assays have two cutoffs: $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ and ${ \mathfrak { s o o n g / m L } }$ .

Method comparison studies were conducted with the EXTC Flex $\textcircled{8}$ reagent cartridge on the Dimension $\otimes$ clinical chemistry system vs. a reference method (GC/MS). Results are summarized in the $2 \times 2$ concordance tables below.

Dear Ms. Lewis:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your evice is classifie ee above)into eitherclass II (Special Controls)or cass II MA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
