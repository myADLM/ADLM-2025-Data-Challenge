4. Panel: Toxicology, 91

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See Indications for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use:

RapidOne Cocaine 150 Test is a one-step lateral flow immunoassay for the qualitative detection of benzoylecgonine in human urine.

RapidOne Cocaine 150 Test is intended for professional use. It is not intended for over the counter sales to nonprofessionals. The assay is easy to perform, but should not be used without proper supervision. The immunoassay is a simplified, qualitative screening method that provides only a preliminary result for use in determining the need for additional or confirmatory testing, i.e., gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).

RapidOne Cocaine 150 Test provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a more confirmed result. GC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

For professional use.

RapidOne Cocaine 150 Test provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a more confirmed result. GC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result.

4. Special instrument requirements:

Not applicable

# I. Device Description:

The test device consists of a membrane strip onto which a drug conjugate has been immobilized. A colloidal gold antibody is dried at one end of the membrane. The test kit contains instructions for use, 50 test devices to which 2 absorbent pads are attached. The lower pad contains anti-benzoylecgonine monoclonal antibody complex. The test line, comprised of a BSA-drug conjugate for the specific analyte, is dried in a thin band on the membrane. A second band (control line) containing goatanti-mouse IgG is placed above the test line. The uppermost absorbent pad acts as a reservoir to collect the urine sample after it migrates through the membrane.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility studies were performed using commercially available benzoylecgonine standards. Each sample at each concentration (0, 75, 113, 150 and $1 8 7 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ) was tested 4 times, twice daily for 5 days. The results are presented in the following table:

# d. Detection limit:

A drug-free urine pool was spiked with benzoylecgonine at the following concentrations: $2 5 \%$ and $50 \%$ below the cutoff, cutoff and $2 5 \%$ above the cutoff. The results are presented in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>BenzoylecgonineConcentrationng/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Percent ofCutoff</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>n</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>NegativeResults</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>PositiveResults</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>75</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>50%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>113</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>75%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>150</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>187</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>125%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10</td></tr></table>

e. Analytical specificity:

A study was conducted to determine the cross-reactivity of the test with compounds in drug-free negative urine. The following compounds showed no interference at concentrations of $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { u g / m L }$ when tested with the RapidOne Cocaine 150 Test:

Heroin (Diacetylmorphine)  
11-Hydroxy- $\cdot \Delta 9$ -Tetrahydrocannabinol  
11-Nor- $\cdot \Delta 8$ -Tetrahydrocannibinol-9-Carboxylic Acid  
11-Nor- $\Delta 9$ -Tetrahydrocannibinol-9-Carboxylic Acid  
11-Nor- $\Delta 9$ -THC-9-Carboxylic Acid Glucuronide

Cross-reactivity was established by spiking various concentrations of drug free urine with similarly structured drug compounds that produced a positive result. The data is presented in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Compound</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentration ng/mL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Benzoylecgonine</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>150</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cocaethylene</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>150</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cocaine</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Metoclopramide</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>80,000</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Procaine (Novacaine)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>75,000</td></tr></table>

pH: Drug free urine was adjusted to $\mathsf { p H }$ values from 3 – 11. Exogenous benzoylecgonine was added to these specimens to give a final concentration of $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . The spiked, pH-adjusted urine was tested with the RapidOne Cocaine 150 Test and interpreted according to the package insert instructions. The results demonstrate that varying ranges of $\mathsf { p H }$ did not interfere with the performance of the test and the ability of the device to detect $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ of benzoylecgonine.

Specific Gravity: A drug free urine (specific gravity 1.020) was diluted to produce various lower specific gravity values. Exogenous benzoylecgonine was added to these specimens to give a final concentration of $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . In addition an aqueous solution (specific gravity 1.000) of $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ of benzoylecgonine was evaluated. These specimens with a specific gravity values ranging from 1.000 – 1.020 were tested with the device and demonstrated that varying ranges of specific gravity did not interfere with the performance of the test.

# f. Assay cut-off:

Studies demonstrating assay performance around the cutoff $\mathrm { 1 5 0 n g / m L }$ benzoylecgonine) are described in the precision section above. Currently, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) recommends $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ as the screening cutoff for cocaine positive specimens.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison evaluation was conducted using ninety-eight (98) clinical urine samples versus Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) at the $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ cut-off. These comparisons of data yielded the following results:
