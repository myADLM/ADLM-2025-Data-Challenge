DRI Oxycodone Assay, 100 ng/mL Cutoff 510(k) Number: K040411

# Indications for Use

The MEDTOX® OXYCODONE Test System uses immunochromatographic test strips for the rapid, qualitative detection of oxycodone in human urine. It is intended for prescription point-of-care use including physician office laboratories and central laboratory settings. It is also intended for workplace settings, criminal justiceor

Section Number 5: MEDTOX® OXYCODONE forensic settings, and drug rehabilitation centers. MEDTOX® OXYCODONE is not for over-the-counter sale.

Workplace operators that may use this device are defined as individuals with a minimum of a high school education who also satisfy the following training and certification guidelines:

(1)Training should be conducted by a qualified professional and include a demonstration of the MEDTOX® OXYCODONE test system and (2) the use of quality assurance samples for monitoring and confirming the performance of the test system. Trainers should observe and confirm that the operator (3) uses proper technique when running a test sample and quality assurance samples, (4) has a basic understanding of test results, including the potential for false positive and false negative results, (5) knows how to prepare a sample for shipment to the laboratory for confirmation testing, (6) has reviewed the information contained in the MEDTOX® Training and Certification Program (available at www.medtox.com) and (7) that the operator minimally achieves a score of $80 \%$ on the written exam provided by MEDTOX.

Operators achieving a score of $80 \%$ will be provided with a certificate of training participation. Quality assurance samples appropriate for training are available from MEDTOX® Diagnostics, Inc. Additionally, MEDTOX® Technical Support wil provide access to assistance from individuals who are experienced in the interpretation of drug testing results.

The test detects oxycodone at concentrations 100 ng/mL and above.

THE MEDTOX® OXYCODONE PROVIDES ONLY A PRELIMINARY ANALYTICAL TEST RESULT. A MORE SPECIFIC ALTERNATE CHEMICAL METHOD MUST BE USED IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A CONFIRMED ANALYTICAL RESULT. GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROMETRY (GC/MS) IS THE PREFERRED CONFIRMATORY METHOD. CLINICAL CONSIDERATION AND PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT SHOULD BE APPLIED TO ANY DRUG OF ABUSE TEST RESULT.

# Test Principle

Each test strip contains antibody colloidal gold, a drug conjugate and a control line. A mouse monoclonal antibody specific to oxycodone is mixed with colloidal gold and applied to the sample well pad of the strip. Drug is conjugated to protein and immobilized at the test line. Strips have an anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody obilizat ol The ntounty s heousny coated on the colloid gold.

When urie is applied othe sample wel the device, the drid antidy-colloal the red antibody-colloidal gold with it.

# Section Number 5: MEDTOX® OXYCODONE

# Interpretation of Results

Negative: When no drug is present in the urine sample, the red antibody-colloidal gold migrates up the test strip and binds to the drug conjugate immobilized on the membrane. The binding of the antibody-colloidal gold to the drug conjugate generates a line at the test line position on the device.

Positive: When drug is present in the sample the antibody-colloidal gold binds the drug before it migrates up the test strip. However, when the antibody-colloidal gold binds the drug in the urine, the antibody-colloidal gold can not bind to the drug conjugate immobilized on the test strip. When the drug concentration is at or above the cutoff concentration, the majority of the antibody-colloidal gold is bound to the drug in the urine. Therefore, as the drug bound antibody-colloidal gold migrates up the test strip it is unable to bind to the drug conjugate immobilized on the membrane. Therefore no line is generated at the test line position on the device.

Control Line: The test strip has an internal procedural control. A control line forms when the antibody-colloidal gold binds to the anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody immobilized on the membrane at the control line position on the device. A line must form at the control line position on the device to indicate that there was an adequate volume of sample, the reagents migrated properly, and that the test strip is intact.

# Summary of MEDTOX® OXYCODONE Performance Testing

# 1. Analytical performance:

# a.Precision/Reproducibility:

Performance around the cutoff concentration was evaluated by testing drugfree urines spiked with standard solutions. Drug free urine was also tested. Testing was performed in triplicate on 6 different occasions by 3 MEDTOX employees who did not develop the test. Samples were randomized and presented as a blind panel.

Data from this study is presented below. The test consistently gave negative results $( 1 0 0 \% )$ for natural urine spiked to $7 5 \%$ below the cutoff (25 ng/mL), and negative results the majority of the time $( 9 3 \% )$ for $50 \%$ below the cutoff $( 5 0 n g / m L )$ . The test consistently gave positive results for natural urine spiked above the cut-off $( 9 8 \%$ 125 ng/mL and $100 \%$ for 150 ng/mL), and positive results the majority of the time $( 9 3 \% )$ at the cutoff. Most of the variability in test results occurred at $2 5 \%$ below the cutoff (75 ng/mL), and here the results were as variable between replicates of the sample as between operators.

# Comparison of Predicate Device and MEDTOX® OXYCODONE

The chosen predicate device is DRI Oxycodone Assay with 100 ng/mL cutoff (510 (k) number K040411). This assay is routinely run by MEDTOX Laboratories to screen urine samples for oxycodone, allowing MEDTOX Diagnostics ready access to samples screened with the predicate device. The table below compares characteristics of the DRI Oxycodone Assay to the MEDTOX® OXYCODONE test.

While the predicate device is an enzymatic test dependent on an instrument, the basic mechanism of detection of oxycodone is the same. Free drug in the urine sample competes with drug conjugated to protein for binding to a drug specific antibody. This basic mechanism and specified cutoff level supports comparison between these two devices for substantial equivalence. Additionally all positive samples were tested against the reference procedure of GC/MS.

# Conclusion

Indication of use and test performance support substantial equivalence for MEDTOX® OXYCODONE to DRI Oxycodone 100ng/mL Assay. Both devices have equivalent Indications for Use. Both devices have the ability to detect true negative samples, samples with oxycodone below the limit of detection for GC/Ms. Both devices have the ability to detect true positive samples, samples with levels of oxycodone 50% above the cutoff or greater. Both devices have the ability to detect oxycodone's primary metabolite oxymorphone. And both devices have limited crossreactivity with other opiate compounds. These four characteristics define the desired performance for a rapid screen assay.
