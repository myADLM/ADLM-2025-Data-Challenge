# Common Name:

# Regulation Name:

Buprenorphine test system.

# Product Code:

DJG

# Classification Number:

21 CFR, 862.3650

# Device Classification:

The Buprenorphine test systems have been classified as Class II devices with moderate complexity. These tests are used to provide only a preliminary analytical result. All positive test results obtained with these devices must be confirmed by another test method, preferably LC/MS analysis.

# Intended Use:

The ACON BUP One Step Buprenorphine Test Strip and ACON BUP One Step Buprenorphine Test Device are rapid chromatographic immunoassays for the qualitative detection of Buprenorphine in urine at a cutoff concentration of $1 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . These tests are used to provide only a preliminary analytical result. All positive test results obtained with these devices must be confirmed by another test method, preferably LC/MS analysis. They are intended for use by healthcare professionals including professionals at point-of-care sites to assist in the determination of drug compliance.

# Description:

The ACON BUP One Step Buprenorphine Test Strip and the ACON BUP One Step Buprenorphine Test Device are competitive binding, lateral flow immunochromatographic assays for the qualitative screening of Buprenorphine in a urine sample. The test is based on the principle of antigen-antibody immunochemistry. It utilizes the mouse monoclonal antibody to selectively detect elevated levels of Buprenorphine in urine at a cutoff concentration of 10 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ .These tests can be performed without the use of an instrument.

A drug-positive urine specimen will not generate a colored-line in the designated test region, while a negative urine specimen or a urine specimen containing Buprenorphine at the concentration below the cutoff level will generate a colored-line in the test region. To serve as a procedural control, a colored-line should always appear at the control region, indicating that proper volume of specimen has been added and membrane wicking has occurred.

# Safety and Effectiveness Data:

# Accuracy

A clinical evaluation was conducted using 226 clinical urine specimens including approximately $1 0 \%$ of the specimens containing Buprenorphine concentration fell between $- 2 5 \%$ cutoff to $+ 2 5 \%$ cutoff range. This evaluation compared the test results between ACON BUP One Step Buprenorphine Test Strip and ACON BUP One Step Buprenorphine Test Device with a FDAcleared Buprenorphine test; as well as compared against data obtained from the customary

Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry analysis. These comparisons of data yielded the following results:

# Performance Characteristics and Other information:

The performance characteristics of the ACON BUP One Step Buprenorphine Test Strip and the ACON BUP One Step Buprenorphine Test Device were verified by analytical sensitivity study, specificity and cross reactivity study, interference studies, precision study, read time flex study, temperature flex study, specimen storage and stability study. Study results indicate that these test devices are robust and can perform satisfactorily when used according to the "Indication for Use" statement specified in their package inserts.

# Conclusion:

These clinical studies demonstrated substantial equivalency on performance between the ACON BUP One Step Buprenorphine Test Strip, the ACON BUP One Step Buprenorphine Test Device and a FDA-cleared Buprenorphine test with the same Buprenorphine cutoff concentration. It is also demonstrated that these tests are safe and effective in qualitatively detecting Buprenorphine at a concentration of $1 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The POL study demonstrated that these tests are suitable for healthcare professionals including professionals at point-of-care sites.

# INDICATIONS FOR USE

510(k) Number (i known): o60466

# Device Name: ACON BUP One Step Buprenorphine Test Strip ACON BUP One Step Buprenorphine Test Device

Indications for Use:

The ACON BUP One Step Buprenorphine Test Strip and the ACON BUP One Step Buprenorphine Test Device are rapid chromatographic immunoassays for the qualitative detection of Buprenorphine in human urine at a designated cutoff concentration of 10 ng/mL. They are intended for use by healthcare professionals including professionals at point-of-care sites to assist in the determination of drug compliance.

This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) are the preferrcd confirmatory mcthods.

Clinical consideration and professional judgment should bc applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.
