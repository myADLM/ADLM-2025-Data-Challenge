# Device name

Proprietary name: ONLINE TDM N-acetylprocainamide

Common name: Enzyme Immunoassay, N-acetylprocainamide

Classification name: Enzyme Immunoassay, N-acetylprocainamide

# Predicate device

We claim substantial equivalence to the currently marketed COBAS INTEGRA N-acetylprocainamide (K951595).

# )Device Description

The ONLINE TDM N-acetylprocainamide assay is for the quantitative determination of N-acetylprocainamide in human serum or plasma on Roche automated clinical chemistry analyzers. The proposed labeling indicates the Roche Hitachi 91 1, 912, 917 and Modular P analyzers can be used with the Roche ONLINE TDM N-acetylprocainamide reagent kits.

The assay is based on a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay technique used for the quantitative analysis of N-acetylprocainamide in human serum or plasma.6,7 The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for antibody binding sites. Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, so the drug concentration in the sample can be measured in terms of enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH, resulting in an absorbance change that is measured spectrophotometrically. Endogenous serum G6PDH does not interfere because the coenzyme functions only with the bacterial (Leuconostoc mesenteroids) enzyme employed in the assay.

# 6. Comparison to the Predicate Device

The Roche ONLINE TDM N-acetylprocainamide assay is substantially equivalent to other products in commercial distribution intended for similar use. Most notably, it is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed Roche COBAS INTEGRA N-acetylprocainamide (K951595).

The Roche ONLINE TDM N-acetylprocainamide assay was evaluated for several performance characteristics including precision, lower detection limit, method comparison, specificity, and interfering substances. All of the evaluation studies gave acceptable results compared to the predicate device. These experiments provide evidence that the Roche ONLINE TDM Nacetylprocainamide assay is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed Roche COBAS INTEGRA N-acetylprocainamide assay. The following table summarizes the precision and method comparison results.

Dear: Mr. Demirtzoglou

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA mav publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice reauirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter willallow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Interet address
