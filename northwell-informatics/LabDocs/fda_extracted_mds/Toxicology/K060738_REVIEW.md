# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

See Indications for Use.

2. Indication(s) for use:

The ONLINE TDM N-acetylprocainamide assay is for the quantitative determination of N-acetylprocainamide in human serum or plasma on Roche automated clinical chemistry analyzers. Measurements obtained from this device are used in the diagnosis and treatment of N-acetylprocainamide overdose and in monitoring the levels of Nacetylprocainamide to help ensure appropriate therapy.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

The device is for prescription use.

4. Special instrument requirements:

Evaluations represented in the 510(k) were performed on the Hitachi 917. See manufacturer’s application sheets for other instruments validated with this assay.

# I. Device Description:

The assay uses a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay technique based on competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for antibody binding sites. Active enzyme converts oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH, resulting in an absorbance change that is measured spectrophotometrically. Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, so the drug concentration in the sample can be measured in terms of enzyme activity.

# L. Test Principle:

The assay is based on a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay technique used for the quantitative analysis of N-acetylprocainamide in human serum or plasma. The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for antibody binding sites. Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, so the drug concentration in the sample can be measured in terms of enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH, resulting in an absorbance change that is measured spectrophotometrically. Endogenous serum G6PDH does not interfere because the coenzyme functions only with the bacterial (Leuconostoc mesenteroids) enzyme employed in the assay.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# 1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Within-lab precision was evaluated at the manufacturer’s site on the Hitachi 911 and 917. One run consisting of triplicates of each sample was performed over 21 days. The evaluation was performed by one operator using one lot of reagents and controls. Control material and spiked human serum pools were evaluated. Two to three calibrations were performed throughout the study. Calculations were performed according to CLSI EP-5A, appendix C. Results are shown below.

<table><tr><td>Sample</td><td>control I</td><td>control II</td><td>control III</td><td>Low HSP</td><td>High HSP</td></tr><tr><td>Total mean (ug/mL)</td><td>1.69</td><td>4.00</td><td>8.18</td><td>4.91</td><td>21.05</td></tr><tr><td>Within-run SD (ug/mL)</td><td>0.07</td><td>0.08</td><td>0.17</td><td>0.093</td><td>0.74</td></tr><tr><td>Within-run CV (%)</td><td>3.9</td><td>2.0</td><td>2.1</td><td>1.9</td><td>3.5</td></tr><tr><td>Total SD (ug/mL)</td><td>0.08</td><td>0.16</td><td>0.26</td><td>0.17</td><td>1.29</td></tr><tr><td>Total CV (%)</td><td>5.0</td><td>4.0</td><td>3.2</td><td>3.4</td><td>6.1</td></tr></table>

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

The measuring range of the device is $0 . 8 - 3 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . To determine the linearity of the assay, an evenly distributed dilution series with positive samples ranging in expected concentration from approximately $3 { - } 3 0 ~ \mathrm { u g / m L }$ (dilutions varying by $10 \%$ increments) was prepared using a NAPA spiked human serum pool diluted with a nonspiked serum pool. Recoveries, representing the observed result (median value, $\mathrm { n } { = } 3$ ) divided by the expected result, ranged from $9 7 \%$ to $104 \%$ . An additional series, evaluated to include values below $3 ~ \mathrm { u g / m L }$ , supports linearity to the low end of the assay range of $0 . 8 \mathrm { u g / m L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Calibrators were cleared under k031856.

Controls were cleared under k060429.

# d. Detection limit:

The manufacturer defines the detection limit as the mean plus 2 standard deviations of the 0 calibrator. For this evaluation, the assay was calibrated as in the normal procedure. The 0 Calibrator was measured in 21 replicates and Calibrator B in 5 replicates in a single run and absorbance values were recorded. Results support the detection limit of $0 . 8 \mathrm { u g / m L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

The assay was evaluated on the Hitachi 917 for interference from drugs, and endogenous compounds.

Cross-reactivity:

The following compounds were tested for cross-reactivity in serum samples containing approximately $5 \mathrm { u g / m L }$ N-acetylprocainamide. Results were compared to those of control samples without cross-reactant. Desethyl-N-acetylprocainamide had a crossreactivity of $1 6 \%$ . The other compounds tested had undetectable cross-reactivity (ND), defined by the manufacturer as a difference in values less than the sensitivity of the assay.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

For one of the evaluations, a comparison of the ONLINE TDM N-acetylprocainamide assay on the Roche/Hitachi 917 analyzer (y) with the COBAS FP N-acetylprocainamide on a COBAS INTEGRA 700 analyzer was performed at the manufacturer’s site. Fifty non-pooled human samples were assayed in singlicate in 1 run. Sample concentrations ranged between 0.5 and $1 6 . 3 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . Results of the analysis are shown:
