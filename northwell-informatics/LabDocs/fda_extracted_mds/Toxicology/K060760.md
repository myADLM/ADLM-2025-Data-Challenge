# Test Description:

The assay employed in the RapidOne'-Buprenorphine Test is based on the same principle of highly specific reactions between antigens and antibodies. This assay is a one-step, competitive, immunoassay for the detection of buprenorphine-and buprenorphine glucuronide in buman urine. The test device consists of a membrane strp onto which a drug conjugate has been mobilized and a colloidal gold-antibody complex is dried at one end of the membrane. In the absence of auy drug in the urine sample, the colloidal gold-antibody complex moves with the urine by capilary action to contact the immobilized drug conjugate. Antibody-antigen reactions occur, forming visible hnes in the "test"area.

When drug is present in the urine sample, the drug or metabolite will compete with the drug conjugate in the test area for the himited antibody sites on the colloidal gold-labeled antibody complex. If sufficient amount of drug is present, it will fill all of the available antibody binding sites, thus preventing attachment of the labeled antibody to the drug conjugate. An absence of a color band (lime) in the "test" area is indicative of a positive

result.

A control band (line), comprised of a different autibody/antigen reaction, is present on the membrane strip. The control hine is not influenced by the presence of absence of drug in the urine, and therefore, should be present on all reactions.

A negative trine will produce two colored bands, arid a positive sample will produce only one band

# Intended Use:

'RapidOne'-Buprenorphine Test is used for the qualitative detection of buprenorphine and buprenorphine ghucuronide in human urine. This immmumoassay is a simplified screening method that provides only a preliminary result for use in determining the need for additional or confrmatory testing ie. liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS).

# Performance Characteristics:

'RapidOne'-Buprenorphine Test will detect buprenorphime at $1 2 . 5 \approx 1 2 . 5 \approx 1 2 . 5 \approx 1 . 5 0 0 ( c m ^ { 2 } )$ and buprenorphine ghucuronide at $\mathbf { i } 0 . 0 \mathbf { n g / m l } .$

Reproducibility was evaluated using control urimes containing concentrations above and below the stated cut-off Negative controls were also used All concentrations were verified by GC/MS. Each sample was tested four times, twice daily, for five days. The results confirmed the reproducibility of the RapidOne'-Buprenorphime Test performance.

# Conclusion:

'RapidOne'-Buprenorphine Test is substantially equivalent to the results obtained with LC/MS.

Dear Dr. Wells:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Interet address

# Indications for Use

Device Name: 'RapidOne'- Buprenorphine Test

Indications For Use:

'RapidOne'-Buprenorphine Test-is a one-step lateral flow immunoassay for the qualitative detection of $1 2 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ of buprenorphine in human urine. :.

'RapidOne'-Buprenorphine Test is intended for professional use. It is not intended for over the counter sales to nonprofessionals. The assay is easy to perform, but should not be used without proper supervision. The immunoassay is a simplified, qualitative screening method that provides only a preliminary result for use in determining the need for additional or confirmatory testing, i.e. liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS).

'RapidOne'-Buprenorphine Test provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a more confirmed result. LC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary results are used.

Prescription Use \* AND/OR Over-The-Counter Use (Part 21 CFR 801 Subpart D) (21 CFR 807 Subpart C)
