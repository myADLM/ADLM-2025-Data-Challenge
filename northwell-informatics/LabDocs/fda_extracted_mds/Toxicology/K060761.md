# 5.3 Device:

Trade or Proprietary Name: BreathScan® Alcohol Detector. 02,.04, .05 and. $0 8 \%$ BAC Sensitivity Cut-Offs

Other Brand Names: Biotech Redwood, EZ Screen, Alco Limit, and Breath Alcohol

Common or usual Name: Breath-alcohol test   
Classification Name: Devices, Breath Trapping, Alcohol   
Product Code: DJZ   
Regulation Number: 862.3050

# 5.4 Predicate Device:

BreathScan is equivalent to: CONNECTABLES® Alcohol Tester manufactured by Connectables, LLC in Waukegan, IL (K052448).

# 5.5 Indications for Use

The BreathScan® Alcohol Detector is an in vitro medical device to qualitatively detect the presence of alcohol in the human breath. It is a disposable screening device for one-time use. The detector is available at several detection cut-offs: 0.02, 0.04, 0.05, and 0.08 percent breath alcohol. The device is used only as a screening device and is only an indication of the possible presence of alcohol in the blood of the test subject. Correlation between breath alcohol_content and blood alcohol content depends on many variables. BreathScan is not intended to legally determine blood alcohol presence, level, or inference of intoxication.

# 5.6 Description of the device

The BreathScan® Alcohol Detector (Tester) is a visual qualitative test for alcohol in human breath. The Tester contains chemicals that change color in the presence of alcohol vapors) utilizing the patented technology (4,740,475). The Tester is made up of a 2-part glass vessel inside a plastic tube. One part contains light yellow crystals that change color when exposed to alcohol vapors. The other part is an opening to blow into while running the test.

If alcohol is present, the crystals will change from yellow to light green/blue. How many crystals turn color will depend on the cut-off of the Tester and how much alcohol is in the breath.

The yellow crystals in the Tester are coated with potassium dichromate $( \mathsf { K } _ { 2 } \mathbf { C } \mathbf { r } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O } _ { 7 } )$ and sulfuric acid $\mathrm { ( H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S O } _ { 4 } \mathrm { ) }$ . The amount of these indicator chemicals is adjusted according to the selected cutoff of the Tester. A color change is produced when alcohol vapors are oxidized to acetic acid and the indicator chemicals change to chromium sulfate $[ \mathrm { C r } _ { 2 } ( \mathrm { S O } _ { 4 } ) _ { 3 } ]$ The majority of crystals change from yellow to light aqua (greenish-blue/bluish-green) when alcohol vapors are present at a level equal to or exceeding the cutoff of the Tester.

The BreathScan® Tester is available in several cut-ffs $( . 0 2 \% , . 0 4 \% , . 0 5 \% ,$ ,and $0 8 \% )$ The cut-off is printed on the Tester label and is expressed as a specific percentage of breath alcohol.

# 5.7 Safety and Effectiveness

The results of bench and user testing indicates that the new device is as safe and effective as an evidentiary breath test, the ALCO SENSOR IV manufactured by Intoximeters, Inc. which is a DOT/NHTSA approved device (Conforming Products List of Evidentiary Breath Measurement Devices - FR/Vol.69, No.134/July 2004/Notices/42237. Multiple user studies were performed to establish that the user could read and understand the directions provided and properly use the device (Table 1).

Additionally, the BreathScan® Alcohol Detector was evaluated and found to meet the guidelines provided in the DOT/NHTSA Model Specifications for Alcohol Screening Devices —(Federal Register/ Vol. 59, No. 147, August 2, 1994 / Notices/39382) with one exception. This exception was that 1 false positive reading out of 1200 readings of the .04 tester that did not contain alcohol.
