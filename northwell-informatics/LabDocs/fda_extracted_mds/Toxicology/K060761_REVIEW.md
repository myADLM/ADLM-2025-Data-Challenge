# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Department of Transportation/ National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [NHTSA Docket No. 94-004; Notice 2] Highway Safety Programs; Model Specifications for Screening Devices to Measure Alcohol in Bodily Fluids

# L. Test Principle:

The BreathScan Alcohol Detector contains chemicals that change color in the presence of alcohol in human breath. The detector is squeezed to break the glass vessel which contains the chemically coated yellow crystals. The user blows into the open end of the plastic tube allowing the breath to come in contact with the yellow crystals. A color change from yellow to blue-green will occur if the alcohol in the breath is at or above the detection limit of the device.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The BreathScan Alcohol Detector was not eligible for testing by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (Department of Transportation (DOT)). The sponsor performed DOT-like testing using the guidelines found in the August 1994 NHTSA/DOT Model Specifications for Alcohol Screening Devices.

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The sponsor performed precision and accuracy testing for each of the four BreathScan Alcohol Detectors (.02, .04, .05 and .08 BAC) using a Breath Alcohol Sample Simulator (BASS), which provides an alcohol-in-air test sample with known alcohol concentrations, flow rate and air composition.

Testing was performed by 43 individuals under five different lighting sources using sixty randomized pre-reacted detectors. The concentrations used were 20 detectors at $0 \%$ BAC, 20 at $60 \%$ below the cut-off concentration and 20 at $60 \%$ above the cut-off concentration. The table below describes the number of devices that resulted in the expected outcome (positive or negative) of the number of devices evaluated.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable. The assay is a qualitative assay.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The device is traceable to a commercially available certified alcohol reference solution. These solutions are used to verify the cut-off concentration of the devices during manufacture.

d. Detection limit:

The NHTSA guidelines do not specifically address the detection limit of breath alcohol devices but require testing at a %BAC of zero (blank reading) to assess the possibility of false positives. The sponsor included a zero concentration samples in their precision study above. Non-alcoholic human breath was used as the sample. All of the devices tested except for the .04 detector under Fluorescent lighting, did not produced a false positive when measuring zero concentration samples. The .04 detector showed one false positive result when read under a Fluorescent light.

# e. Analytical specificity:

The sponsor performed the following studies for each cut-off concentration (0.02, 0.04, 0.05 and $0 . 0 8 \%$ BAC) to evaluate the potential interference on the test results from cigarette smoke, temperature and vibration.

Cigarette smoke – An alcohol-free volunteer was asked to smoke approximately one half of a cigarette. The volunteer then performed a breath alcohol reading. The volunteer then smoked another inhalation and repeated test to produce a total of five trials for each cut-off concentration. The BreathScan Alcohol Detector produced no false positives results under these conditions.

Temperature – The sponsor assessed the effect of temperature at 10 and at 40 $^ \mathrm { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . A total of forty different devices were stored at each temperature for each cut-off concentration. Using simulated breath (BASS) twenty samples that were $60 \%$ below the device cut-off and twenty samples were $60 \%$ above the cut-off were tested. The results are presented in the table below:

Vibration - A total of forty different devices were mounted on a shaketable or rocker for each cut-off concentration for 5 minutes. Using simulated breath (BASS) twenty samples that were $60 \%$ below the device cut-off and twenty samples were $60 \%$ above the cut-off were tested. The results are presented in the table below:

<table><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="2">Cut-off</td><td colspan="2" rowspan="1">BreathScan Results</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">60% belowCut-off</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">60% above Cut-off</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">.02</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20/20 Negative</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20/20 Positive</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">.04</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20/20 Negative</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20/20 Positive</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">.05</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20/20 Negative</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20/20 Positive</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">.08</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20/20 Negative</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20/20 Positive</td></tr></table>

f. Assay cut-off:

Each device will produce a blue-green color at or above the following cut-off concentration, .02, .04, .05 and . $. 0 8 \ \% \mathrm { B A C }$ .

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The sponsor conducted a consumer study comparing the BreathScan Alcohol Detector . $04 \%$ BAC to a quantitative comparator device device. The purpose of the study was to determine if consumers could correctly perform and interpret the test according to the package insert. There were 24 paired volunteers (drinker, non-drinker). The reported age range of the volunteers was from below 30 to 60 years of age. There were 18 males and 30 females who participated in the trail. The non-drinker administered the test to the drinker and then read the results. The drinker then provided another breath sample, which was analyzed using the quantitative device operated by a trained individual. The breath alcohol concentrations ranged from a BAC of $0 . 0 0 \%$ to $0 . 1 4 4 \%$ by the predicate device.

Ninety-three breath alcohol tests were performed and the results are in the table below:
