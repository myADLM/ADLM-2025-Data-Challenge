E. Applicant: Biosite, Inc.

F. Proprietary and Established Names: Triage® TOX Drug Screen Controls

G. Regulatory Information: 1. Regulation section: 21 CFR $\ S$ 862.3280

2. Classification: Class I (reserved)

3. Product code: DIF

4. Panel: Toxicology (91)

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): Refer to Indications for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use:

The Triage TOX Drug Screen Controls are to be used with the Triage TOX Screen tests and Triage Meters to assist the laboratory in monitoring test performance.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use

4. Special instrument requirements: Biosite Triage Meters

# I. Device Description:

Level 1 of the Triage TOX Drug Screen Controls is a negative control prepared from drug-free urine. Level 2 is a positive control prepared by adding $\mathrm { d } / 1$ -methadone, acetaminophen, d-amphetamine, d-methamphetamine, pentobarbital, estazolam, desipramine, phencyclidine, morphine, benzoylecgonine, and tetrahydrocannabinol to human urine. The concentrations for each drug in the positive control are 2-4 times the cutoff concentration of the respective drug assays.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability

The controls are traceable to commercially available drug-free urine and $\mathrm { d } / 1$ -methadone. The negative control is drug-free urine with a zero concentration of all analytes. The $\mathrm { d } / 1$ -methadone is solubilized in distilled water to produce a concentrated stock solution, which is then diluted with drug-free urine to the final concentration of the positive control.

# Stability

The sponsor’s real-time stability protocol uses the following formula to calculate recovery at specific storage times at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ :

$\%$ recovery $=$ (measured concentration at time point)-20C / (measured concentration at time point)-70C

The sponsor’s stability criteria are met when all of the time point recoveries at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ are within 80 to 120 percent of the recoveries at $- 7 0 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ or when the trendline recovery lies within an 80 to 120 percent recovery acceptance window.

At the time of submission, the sponsor had collected two weeks of stability data on the controls. On-going real-time stability testing of the controls will continue until the material fails the pre-determined acceptance criteria. The shelf life of the controls will be extended based upon the on-going real-time stability data.

All stability claims are for closed-vial stability only. Open-vial stability is not applicable to this device since it is intended for one time use.

# Value Assignment

The negative control consists of drug-free urine and therefore contains none of the drugs of abuse currently available on the Triage system. To add methadone to the previously cleared positive control, a concentrated stock solution was diluted with drug-free urine to a final concentration of $7 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (calculated gravimetrically). Values were verified by analyzing 90 replicates of each control using three lots and two operators over three days. All of the negative control replicates produced negative results for all analytes and all of the positive control replicates produced positive results for all analytes.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable
