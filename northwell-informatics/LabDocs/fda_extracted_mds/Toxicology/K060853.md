# Device name

Proprietary name: ONLINE TDM Tobramycin

Common name: RADIOIMMUNOASSAY, TOBRAMYCIN

Classification name: RADIOIMMUNOASSAY, TOBRAMYCIN

# Predicate device

We claim substantial equivalence to the currently marketed COBAS INTEGRA Tobramycin (K964457).

# Device Description

The ONLINE TDM Tobramycin assay is for the quantitative determination of tobramycin in human serum or plasma on Roche automated clinical chemistry analyzers. The proposed labeling indicates the Roche Hitachi 911, 912, 917 and Modular P analyzers can be used with the Roche ONLINE TDM Tobramycin reagent kits.

Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used in the treatment of infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus species, E. coli, Klebsiella, Serratia, Citrobacter, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter and other microorganisms. Tobramycin's toxic effect is produced by interfering with ribosomal protein synthesis. Tobramycin undergoes very lttle, i any, metabolization and is, therefore, eliminated as the parent drug by glomerular filtration. The half-lifeof tobramycin in serum or plasma correlates closely with renal function and thus is quite variable between individuals and within one individual over time.2,3 Serum or plasma tobramycin concentration is also impacted by mode of administration, the volume of extracellular fluid, the duration of the treatment and physiological changes during the illness and therapy. The therapeuticrange tobramyci should be measured at peak as well as trough concentrations. In patients with pre-existing renal damage or those to whom tobramycin has been administered for prolonged periods or in doses above the therapeutic range, hearing impairment and/or nephrotoxicity may develop. Therefore, monitoring of peak and trough tobramycin serum or plasma levels is critical in the prevention of these serious complications with the adjustment of dosage administration as indicated.

# 6 Comparison to the Predicate Device

The Roche ONLINE TDM Tobramycin assay is substantially equivalent to other products in commercial distribution intended for similar use. Most notably, it is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed Roche COBAS INTEGRA Tobramycin (K964457).

The Roche ONLINE TDM Tobramycin assay was evaluated for several performance characteristics including precision, lower detection limit, method comparison, specificity, and interfering substances. All of the evaluation studies gave acceptableresults compared to the predicate device. These experiments provide evidence that the Roche ONLINE TDM Tobramycin assay is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed Roche COBAS INTEGRA Tobramycinassay. The following table summarizes the precision and method comparison results.

Re: k060853 Trade/Device Name: ONLINE TDM Tobramycin Regulation Number: 21 CFR $\ S 8 6 2 . 3 9 0 0$ Regulation Name: Tobramycin test system Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: KLB Dated: March 28, 2006 Received: March 29, 2006

Dear Mr. Demirtzoglou:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
