CLSI EP5-T2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods

Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff; Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy, December 11, 2003

# L. Test Principle:

The assay is based on a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay technique used for the quantitative analysis of tobramycin in human serum or plasma. The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the enzyme glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for antibody binding sites. Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, so the drug concentration in the sample can be measured in terms of enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH, resulting in an absorbance change that is measured spectrophotometrically. Endogenous serum G6PDH does not interfere because the coenzyme functions only with the bacterial (Leuconostoc mesenteroids) enzyme employed in the assay.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision study was conducted on control material and spiked human serum pools using a modified version of CLSI-EP5-T2. The evaluation included using triplicate samples, 3 runs per day over 21 days $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 6 3 )$ ). The results of the study met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria for within-run precision (SD no greater than 0.14 up to a concentration of $2 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ or CV $\leq 7 \%$ at higher concentrations) and total and between-day precision (SD no greater than 0.18, up to a concentration of $2 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ or $C V \leq 9 \%$ at higher concentrations). The results are tabulated below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

To assess the linearity of the assay, an 11-level dilution series was prepared using tobramycin spiked human serum pool diluted with a tobramycin negative human serum pool. The percent recoveries within the reportable range $( 0 . 3 3 - 1 0 . 0 { \mathrm { u g / m L } } )$ ) were $9 4 . 2 – 1 0 1 . 8 \%$ and met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of $\%$ recovery within $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the theoretical value up to $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . Results were evaluated by linear regression. The linearity results are tabulated below:

The sponsor evaluated the performance of the TDM Preciset Multianalyte Calibrator diluent by comparing results of the diluted samples with neat samples (8.6 and $9 . 3 \mathrm { u g / m L }$ ) and the results of the diluted samples with spiked samples (12 and $1 7 \mathrm { u g / m L }$ ). The sponsor’s acceptance criteria for these studies: percent $( \% )$ difference $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the values of the neat samples and the spiked samples.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The 18 month shelf life claim for the Online TDM Tobramycin reagent was initially assessed by accelerated stability experiments and followed up with real time stability experiments. The 60 days on board instrument stability claim was assessed with real time studies. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria was reviewed and found to be acceptable.

Calibrators and controls were previously cleared (k060429 and k031856) and are sold separately.

# d. Detection limit:

The lower detection limit claim of $0 . 3 3 \mathrm { u g / m l }$ is based on the mean and two standard deviations of 21 determinations of zero calibrator material. A linear interpolation model, based on these determinations of the zero calibrator material well as five replicate determinations of Calibrator B $\mathrm { 1 . 0 \ u g / m L ) }$ , was used to calculate the concentration equivalent to the mean plus two standard deviations.

e. Analytical specificity:

To evaluate potential interference from drugs and metabolites, serum pools were spiked with potential interferents and approximately $3 \mathrm { u g / m l }$ tobramycin. Drugs found to cross-react at high concentrations were run in a series of dilutions. Percent cross reactivity for drugs and metabolites were defined as: [(Da-Dt)/C] $\mathbf { x } 1 0 0$ , where $\mathrm { D t } =$ the measured concentration of the control analyte, $\mathrm { D } \mathbf { a } =$ measured concentration of the control analyte $^ +$ cross-reactant and $\mathrm { C } =$ known concentration of cross-reactant. Calculated cross-reactivities are based on the median of triplicate determinations Observed cross-reactivities with the compounds tested are tabulated below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Compound</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentration(ug/ml)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>% cross-reactivity</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Amikacin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.55</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Kanamycin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.32</td></tr></table>

No cross-reactivity was detected for the following drugs (concentrations in $\mathrm { { u g / m l } }$ ): chloramphenicol (1000), erythromycin (1000), tetracycline (1000), sulphamethoxazole (600), trimethoprin (25), carbenicillin (1000), cephalothin (1000), clindamycin (1000), gentamicin (25), gentamicin (100), neomycin (100), netilmicin (100), penicillin G (1000), sisomycin (100), streptomycin (100) and vancomycin (200).

Sixteen common drugs were tested for interference on the Hitachi 917 in normal human serum pools spiked with tobramycin at 2.5 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . Sponsor’s acceptance criteria: recovery $+ / - 1 0 \%$ of the control value. No significant interference was observed for the following drugs at the concentrations tested (concentrations in $\mathsf { u g / m l } )$ :

acetylcysteine (150) , ampicillin (1000), ascorbic acid (300) , KDobesilate (200), methyldopa (20), Doxycycline (50), cyclosporine (5), levodopa (20), metronidazole (200), phenylbutazone (400) , acetylsalicylic acid (1000) , rifampicin (60), acetaminophen (200), ibuprofen (500), cefoxitin (2500), and theophylline (100).

To evaluate interference from endogenous compounds, a series of dilutions containing varying levels of the endogenous compounds was prepared from spiked pooled serum. Testing was in the presence of $3 \mathrm { u g / m l }$ tobramycin (except for intralipid, conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin in which samples contained $7 \mathrm { u g / m l }$ tobramycin.) Percent recovery was calculated relative to control samples containing tobramycin without spiked endogenous

compounds. The median of triplicate determinations was used in calculations of recovery. Concentrations ranges of endogenous compound in which assay recovery $\geq 9 0 \%$ is observed are tabulated below:

Thirty samples were included for fluoride/potassium oxalate and citrate anticoagulants; fifteen samples were included for EDTA, sodium heparin, and lithium heparin. No significant bias due to these anticoagulants was observed.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The therapeutic range for this specific assay was not determined. The sponsor stated that similar diagnostic technologies have shown that in most adults, a peak therapeutic response is achieved with tobramycin concentration ranges of $6 { \cdot } 1 0 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m L }$ and trough concentration ranges of $0 . 5 { - } 2 . 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . The sponsor stated in the package insert that each laboratory should investigate the transferability of the expected values to its own patient population and if necessary determine its own reference range. Test findings should always be assessed in conjunction with patient's medical history, clinical examination and other medical findings. The following ranges for peak and trough were taken from the literature and included in the package insert:
