# I. Device Description:

The OnTrak TesTcup II and OnSite Cupkit assays are in vitro diagnostic tests intended for professional use for the qualitative detection of amphetamines (d,lamphetamine $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } ) }$ ), benzodiazepines (oxazepamn $2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ), cocaine metabolite (benzoylecgonine $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ), methamphetamine (d-methamphetamine $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , morphine (morphine $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ), morphine 2000 (morphine 2000 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ), PCP (phencyclidine $2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ), and THC (1 1-nor-A9-THC-9-carboxylic acid $5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ) and were previously cleared under k033902. The OnTrak TesTcup II and OnSite Cupkit product lines have several different types that use varying combinations of the above drugs of abuse test strips.

This submission (k060896) is for the clearance of methamphetamine (dmethamphetamine) at a $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ cut-off to be packaged with the drugs of abuse test strips above. The methamphetamine assay with a $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ cutoff has exactly the same antibody and antigen as the previously cleared $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ methamphetamine

assay. The label system (polystyrene beads), nitrocellulose membrane, control-line antibody, and sample pad are also identical between the two. The difference between the two assays is a slight difference in the typical volume of polystyrene bead labeled antibody and capture antigen.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were identified by the applicant.

# L. Test Principle:

The assays are based on the principle of microparticle capture inhibition. The test relies on the competition between drug, which may be present in the urine being tested, and drug conjugate immobilized on a membrane in the test chamber. Urine is collected directly in the test cup provided. The drug profile card is placed in the samples by inserting it into the lid holder, then securing the lid onto the cup. Urine is drawn in the profile card by capillary action and reacts with antibody coated microparticles and drug conjugate present on the membrane. In the absence of drug, the antibody is free to interact with the drug conjugate, causing the formation of a blue band.

When drug is present in the specimen, it binds to the antibody-coated microparticles. If sufficient drug is present, the microparticles are inhibited from binding the drug conjugate and no blue band is formed at the result window. A preliminary positive ("non-negative" result is the absence of a blue band).

An additional antibody/antigen reaction occurs at the "VALID" area. The "VALID" blue band forms when antibodies, which are imbedded in the reagent membrane, interact with and bind to the antigen on the blue microparticles.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision of the assay for methamphetamine $\mathrm { 3 0 0 n g / m L }$ cut-off) was determined by testing 63 replicates across three different days with 6 different concentrations: 0, 75, 150, 225, 375, and $4 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ (21 replicates for each concentration per day, for a total of 378 devices tested) using a Methamphetamine urine standard containing drug at different concentrations. Results were read by the three operators. Samples were randomized and blind with respect to the operators. Results are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The sponsor did not indicate any degree of traceability for their devices. Control materials are required but are not specifically identified in the labeling. No calibrators are required. The device is calibrated during the manufacturing process.

# d. Detection limit:

Sensitivity of qualitative assays may be characterized by validating performance around the claimed cutoff concentration of the assay, and demonstrating the lowest concentration of drug that is capable of or consistently producing a positive result. This information appears in the precision section, a., above.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Each substance was tested starting with a $1 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ solution or a 1000 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ solution in a negative urine control. Each compound was diluted and tested negative result appeared for methamphetamine. Three OnSite CupKit devices were tested per substance by pipetting approximately 100 to $2 0 0 { \mathrm { u L } }$ of spiked urine onto the appropriate feedhole. Devices were color rated according to the QC color rating scale. If at least 2 out of 3 negative results were seen for methamphetamine, then the sponsor defines this as no interference at that level. The entire protocol was repeated for each of the two lots. Results are summarized below.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The methamphetamine strip within the TesTcup II /CupKit was evaluated in a SAMHSA certified laboratory using clinical specimens. The clinical negative samples were screened negative by automated immunoassay and reported as negatives according to SAMSHA guidelines. Clinical specimens screened positive by automated immunoassay were subsequently analyzed by GC/MS. Ten samples were diluted once with negative human urine to achieve the appropriate test range.

A total of 100 negative urine samples were tested, $10 \%$ of these specimens, chosen at random were confirmed negative by GC/MS. A total of 50 positive urine samples were tested. $10 \%$ of the samples were between $7 5 \%$ and $100 \%$ of the analyte cutoff; another $10 \%$ of the samples were between $100 \%$ and $12 5 \%$ of the cutoff. The remainders of the samples were at concentrations greater than $12 5 \%$ of the cutoff. Results are summarized below.
