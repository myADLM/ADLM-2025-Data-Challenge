# Device Name

Proprietary name: Cholinesterase Gen.2 test system

Common name: Cholinesterase

Classification name: Cholinesterase test system.

# Predicate devices

The Cholinesterase Gen.2 test system is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed Cholinesterase Test System cleared under K951595.

Device Description

The Cholinesterase Gen.2 Test System is an in vitro test for the quantitative determination of the catalytic activity of cholinesterase in serum and plasma. The test is based on the butyrylthiocholine method. Cholinesterase catalyzes the hydrolysis of butyrylthiocholine to thiocoline and butyrate. Thiocholine reduces the yellow substrate hexacyanoferrate III to the almost colorless hexacyanoferrate II. The decrease in color is measured spectrophotometrically. The calibrator is the Calibrator for automated systems (C.f.a.s; and the recommended control materials are Precinorm U or Precinorm U Plus; and Precipath U or Precipath U plus.

# Intended use

The Cholinesterase Gen.2 Test System is an in vitro test for the quantitative determination of the catalytic activity of cholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.8; acycholine acylhydrolase) in serum and plasma.

Dear Ms. Ambrose:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments. or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807): labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
