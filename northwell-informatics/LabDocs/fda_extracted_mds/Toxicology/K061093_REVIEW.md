# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced.

# L. Test Principle:

The Cholinesterase Gen.2 Test System is an in vitro test for the quantitative determination of the catalytic activity of cholinesterase in serum and plasma. The test is based on the butyrylthiocholine method. Cholinesterase catalyzes the hydrolysis of butyrylthiocholine to thiocoline and butyrate. Thiocholine reduces the yellow substrate hexacyanoferrate III to the almost colorless hexacyanoferrate II. The decrease in color is measured spectrophotometrically.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Within-run $( \mathrm { n } { = } 2 1$ ) and between-day precision was conducted for the Cholinesterase Gen.2 test system using two controls and two human serum pools on the Integra 800 Analyzer. The between-day precision samples were run in triplicate and the second of the three results were used for the precision determination. The precision summaries are listed in the tables below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The measuring range for this assay is 200 – 14000 U/L.

The sponsor conducted two serial dilution linearity studies for the Cholinesterase Gen.2 test system on the Integra 800 analyzer. The samples were prepared by spiking a saline solution with pure cholinesterase from human plasma and diluting with saline. One study measured samples ranging from $4 0 4 - 4 8 0 1 \ \mathrm { U / L }$ (theoretical spiked concentration). The second study measured samples ranging from 2762 – 27621 U/L(theoretical spiked concentration). All samples were recovered within $+ / -$ $10 \%$ of the theoretical concentration. The extended measuring range from 14000 to 28000 (based on post dilution factor of 2) was was also validated in the second set of samples.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The calibrators and controls for use with this device have been previously cleared. Their composition has not been modified for use with the Cholinesterase Gen.2 test system. The calibrators and controls are standardized against and traceable to a reference method using a manual application of the butyrlthiocholine/ hexacyanoferrate (III) method on a photometer and the published molar absorptivity of hexacyanoferrate (III)

Stability studies for the device were described. Studies supported the sponsor’s 4-week on-board stability claim. The sponsor also described realtime and an accelerated studies to support the 15 month closed stability claim.

# d. Detection limit:

Analytical sensitivity (Limit of Blank) was defined as the concentration at three standard deviations above the mean of repeated measurements $( \mathrm { N } { = } 2 1 )$ ) of the zero calibrator. The mean $\mathrm { ~ + ~ } ( 3 \mathrm { x S D } )$ was calculated to be $1 2 2 . 8 \ : \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ . The sponsor claims a lower detection limit of $2 0 0 \mathrm { U / L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Human serum pools that contained $5 8 1 7 - 9 1 4 3 { \mathrm { ~ U / L } }$ cholinesterase was evaluated for endogenous interference by the Cholinesterase Gen.2 test system. The sponsor defined interference as percent recovery that exceeded $+ / - 1 0 \%$ of the expected $100 \%$ recovery. Human serum pools that contained approximately $4 7 0 0 \mathrm { U / L }$ cholinesterase were tested by the Cholinesterase Gen.2 test system for drug interference. The sponsor defined drug interference as results that deviated more than $10 \%$ from the reference value. A list of compounds tested can be found in the device labeling. There was no interference $( < 1 0 \% )$ from the 18 drug pharmaceuticals tested and also from the following substances:

Hemoglobin up to $3 4 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ,

Bilirubin: conjugated up to $6 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and unconjugated up to $8 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and Lipemia up to $9 9 7 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ .

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.
