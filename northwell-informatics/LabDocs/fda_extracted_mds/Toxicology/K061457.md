# Device Classification: II

Substantially Equivalent Devices:

ACON TCA One Step Tricyclic Antidepressant Test Manufactured by ACON Laboratories

Instant -View $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Propoxyphene (PPX) Urine Test Manufactured by Alfa Scientific Designs, Inc

# Product Description:

UCP Rapid'M Drug Screening Tricyclic Antidepressant, Propoxyphene Tests are competitive binding, lateral flow immunochromatographic assays for qualitatively the detection of Tricyclic Antidepressant, Propoxyphene and their metabolites at the cut-off levels as indicated. The tests can be performed without the use of an instrument.

# Intended Use:

UCP Rapid 1M Drug Screening Tricyclic Antidepressant, Propoxyphene Test are rapid, qualitative, competitive binding immunoassays and intended for qualitatively the detection Tricyclic Antidepressant, Propoxyphene and their metabolites in human urine at the following cut-off concentrations:

Tricyclic Antidepressant Propoxyphene

1000 ng/mL   
300 ng/mL

The tests provide only preliminary test results, which should be confirmed by other methods such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Clinical considerations and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated. The tests are not intended to be used in monitoring the drugs levels.

# Comparison to Predicate Devices:

When compared to the predicates, UCP Rapid™M Drug Screening Tricyclic Antidepressant and Propoxyphene Tests provide the qualitative determination of the same drugs in the same matrix, and utilizes the same cutoff concentrations. Both tests are immunochromatographic, lateral flow assays for the qualitative detection of drugs with visual, qualitative end results. Both tests are intended to provide preliminary analytical test results.

# Safety and Effectiveness Data: Accuracy

A clinical comparison study was conducted using 128 clinical urine specimens per each drug including approximately $10 \%$ of the specimens containing one type drug at concentrations between $- 5 0 \%$ cutoff to cutoff ranges, another $10 \%$ of the specimens containing one type drug at concentrations between cutoffs to $+ 5 0 \%$ E Drug Screening Tricyclic Antidepressant Tests with ACON TCA One Step Tricyclic Antidepressant Tests, UCP Rapid™M Drug Screening Propoxyphene Test with Instant-View $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Propoxyphene Urine test. Total 64 positive clinical urine specimens and 64 negative clinical urine specimens were tested against each drug. All test results were confirmed with HPLC or GC/MS analysis. UCP Rapid™M Drug Screening Tricyclic Antidepressant Test and UCP Rapid Drug Screening Propoxyphene Test demonstrated performance O $f \geq 9 8 \%$ for all drugs when performance was compared to a legally marketed device and HPLC or GC/MS.

# Other Information about Performance Characteristics:

The performance characteristics of UCP Rapid™M Drug Screening Tricyclic Antidepressant Test, UCP Rapid™ Drug Screening Propoxyphene Test was evaluated by precision study, sensitivity study, specificity and cross reactivity study, interference study and stability study. The study results indicate that UCP Rapid Drug Screening Tricyclic Antidepressant Test, UCP Rapid™ Drug Screening Propoxyphene Test performs satisfactorily when used according to the package inserts.

# Conclusion:

UCP Rapid™M Drug Screening Tricyclic Antidepressant Test is substantially equivalent to ACON TCA One Step Tricyclic Antidepressant Test, UCP Rapid™M Drug Screening Propoxyphene Test is substantially equivalent to Instant-View $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Propoxyphene (PPX) Urine Test.

Dear Ms. Chen:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
