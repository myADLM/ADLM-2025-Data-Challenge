# K. Test Principle:

The Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CSAE Cyclosporine Extended Range Calibrator contains cyclosporine in a preserved whole blood hemolysate. It is intended to be used to calibrate the high range cyclosporine assay on the Dimension $\mathfrak { B }$ clinical chemistry systems and the Syva® Emit $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 2000 Cyclosporine assay.

# L. Performance Characteristics:

1. Stability

Target shelf life for the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CSAE Calibrator (DC108A) is 12 months. Studies require 13 months of real time testing on three lots of product. Calibrator shelf life is determined by comparing results of the product stored at -15 to ${ \bf - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (recommended storage temperature) with product stored at $- 7 0 \mathrm { ‰}$ (reference storage temperature) to ensure that analytical system drift is dissociated with calibrator drift. Product is tested at days 0, 7, 14, 30, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, 330, 360, 390.

# 2. Traceability:

Novartis Pharmaceutical USP Grade CSA powder is used to formulate a reference stock solution. A reference lot is formulated by diluting the stock into whole blood hemolysate with preservatives at six different levels and stored $- 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ The reference lot is assigned by LC/MS/MS.

# Value Assignment

A cyclosporine stock solution is prepared using standard gravimetric procedure. Aliquots of the stock solution are added to measured amounts of calibrator matrix to yield the desired concentration for each calibrator level. Cyclosporine calibrators are prepared in preserved whole blood hemolysate. The recovery of the six levels are verified verses a control calibrator lot (control calibrator $=$ any approved calibrator lot) and verses the frozen reference lot.

# M. Comments on Substantial Equivalence/Conclusion

The performance testing according to the verification and validation test protocols demonstrate that the Dimension $^ { © }$ CSAE Calibrator (DC108A) is substantially equivalent to the designated predicate device.

Dear Ms. Tasker:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification.The A finding of substantial equivalenceof your device to a lally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484.
