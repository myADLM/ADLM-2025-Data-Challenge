# I. Device Description:

The Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CSAE Cyclosporine Extended Range Calibrator contains cyclosporine in a preserved whole blood hemolysate. The kit consists of 2 sets of the following: one glass vial of sample diluent $\mathrm { ( 0 . 0 \ n g / m l }$ of cyclosporine ) and one glass vial of levels 1 through 5. Target concentrations for the five calibrator levels are approximately 200, 400, 800, 1400 and $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ of cyclosporine. Level 0 is included for dilution of over-range samples $( > 2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L ) }$ in order to obtain results within the assay range; it is not used in calibration. Levels 1 thru 5 are used for calibration of the CSAE method.

Human Source Material was tested by FDA approved methods for the presence of antibodies to Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) and Type 2 (HIV-2), as well as for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen and antibody to Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), and found to be negative (not repeatedly reactive.)

# L. Test Principle:

Not applicable.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable. b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable. c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Stability:

Target shelf life for the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CSAE Calibrator (DC108A) is 12 months. Calibrator shelf life is determined by comparing results of the product stored at - 15 to $- 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (recommended storage temperature) with product stored at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ (reference storage temperature) to ensure that analytical system drift is dissociated with calibrator drift. Three lots of product were tested on days 0, 7, 14, 30, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, 330, 360, 390.

# Traceability:

Commercially available CSA powder is used to formulate a reference stock solution. A reference lot is formulated by diluting the stock into whole blood hemolysate with preservatives at six different levels and stored $\mathrm { - 7 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ . The reference lot value is assigned by LC/MS/MS.

# Value Assignment:

A cyclosporine stock solution is prepared using standard gravimetric procedure. Aliquots of the stock solution are added to measured amounts of calibrator matrix to yield the desired concentration for each calibrator level. Cyclosporine calibrators are prepared in preserved whole blood hemolysate. The recovery of the six levels are verified versus a control calibrator lot (control calibrator $=$ any approved calibrator lot) and versus the frozen reference lot.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable.   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable.   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable.   
b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range: Not applicable.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
