# Predicate Devices:

Forsure One Step Dip & Read Drug Screen Test Device is substantially equivalent to UCP Bioscience Rapid Drug Screening Test Strips cleared by FDA (K050540), or TNB Forsure One Step Drug Screen Test Cup Devicc cleared by FDA (K052882) and GC/MS for its stated intended use.

# Device Description:

Forsure One Step Dip & Read Drug Screen Test consists of a or multiple chromatographic absorbent srip in which the drug or drug metabolites in the sample compete with a dr conjugate immobilized on a porous membrane support for the limited antibody sites. As the test sample flows through the absorbent strip, the Colloidal Gold labeled antibody- conjugate binds to the free drug in the specimen forming an antibody-antigen complex. This complex competes with immobilized antigen conjugate in the Test reaction zone and will not produce a magenta color band when the drug is above the detection level of $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ of Amphetamine, $\mathrm { 1 0 0 0 n g / m l }$ of Methamphetamine, $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g }$ of THC, $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ of Morphine,300 ng of Benzoylecognine , $2 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m } \mathrm { { I } } }$ of Phencyclidine, $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ of Benzodiazepine, $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ of Methadone , $\mathrm { 1 0 0 ~ n g / m l }$ of Oxycodone , $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ of Tricyclic Antidepressant, $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ of Barbiturates and $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ of Propoxyphene. Unbound colloidal gold-labeled antibody conjugate binds to the reagent in the negative control zone, producing a magenta color band, demonstrating that the reagents and device are functioning correctly. A NEGATIVE specimen produces two distinct color bands in both the specific drug test region and control area. A PRELIMINARY POSITIVE specimen produces only one color band in the control area and no color band on the specific drug test region. There is no meaning attributed to color or its intensity for either line. To serve as a procedural control, a colored line will always appear at the control line region, indicating that proper volume of specimen has been added and membrane wicking has occurred.

# Intended Use:

Forsure One Step Dip & Read Drug Screen Test of Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Benzoylecgonine, Benzodiazepine, Marijuana, Morphine, Phencyclidine, Methadone , Oxycodone, Tricyclic Antidepressant, Barbiturates and Propoxyphene Test device are a Chromatographic immunoassay for qualitative determination of the presence of Amphetamine at a cutoff concentration of $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , Methamphetamine at a cutoff concentration of $\boldsymbol { 1 0 0 0 } \ : \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , THC at a cutoff concentration of $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m l }$ , Morphine at a cutoff concentration of $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ , Benzoylecgonine at a cutoff concentration of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ . Phencyclidine at a cutoff concentration of $2 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / n } \mathrm { { \Omega } } }$ , Benzodiazepine at cutoff concentration of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ , Methadone at cutoff concentration of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ , Oxycodone at cutoff concentration of $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ , Tricyclic Antidepressant at cutoff concentration of $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { \mathfrak { n } g / \mathfrak { m } l } }$ Barbiturates at cutoff concentration of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { \mathfrak { n g / m } } \mathrm { { I \bar { \Omega } } } }$ , and Propoxyphene at cutoff concentration of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ The assay provides a simple and rapid analytical screening procedure to detect Amphctamine, THC, Morphine, Methamphetamine, Benzoylecogninc, Phencyclidine, Benzodiazepine, Methadone, Oxycodone, Tricyclic Antidepressant, Barbiturates and Propoxyphene in human urine. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method.

# Comparison to Predicate Device(s):

Forsure One Step Dip & Read Drug Screen Test is substantially equivalent to UCP Rapid Drug Screening Test strips system cleared by FDA, e.g., the Assay (K050540) or TNB Forsure One Step Drug Screen Test Cup Device urine test ( K 052882 ) and GC/MS for its stated intended use.

Dear Mr. Berlie:

We have reviewed your Section 5 10(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into cither class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

# Indications for Use

510(k) Number (if known): k061617

Device Name: Forsure One Step Dip & Read Drug Screen Test

# Indications for Use:

Forsure One Step Dip & Read Drug Screen Test is a prescription assay intended for professional use in central laboratories only. It provides qualitative screening results for Amphetamine (AMP), Methamphetamine (MET), Benzodiazepine (BZD), Barbiturate (BAR), Cocaine (COC), Cannabinoids (THC), Opiates (OPI), Phencyclidine (PCP), Methadone (MAD), Oxycodone (OXY), Tricyclic Antidepressant (TCA) and Propoxyphene (PPX) in human urine at the following cutoff levels:

Test   
Amphetamine   
Methamphetamine   
Benzodiazepine   
Barbiturate   
Cocaine   
Cannabinoids   
Opiates   
Phencyclidine   
Methadone   
Oxycodone   
Tricyclic Antidepressant   
Propoxyphene

Calibrator Cutoff D-Amphetamine 1000 ng/ml D-Methamphetamine 1000 ng/ml Oxazepam 300 ng/ml Secobarbital 300 ng/ml Benzoylecgonine 300 ng/ml 11-nor-49-THC-9 COOH 50 ng/ml Morphine 2000 ng/ml Phencyclidine 25 ng/ml Methadone 300 ng/ml Oxycodone 100 ng/ml Nortriptyline 1000 ng/ml Propoxyphene 300 ng/ml
