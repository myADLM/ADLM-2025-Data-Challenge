$1 { , } 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ or $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ for Amphetamine, $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ for Barbiturate,   
$3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ for Benzodiazepines,   
$3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ or $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ for Cocaine,   
$5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for Marijuana,   
$3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ for Methadone,   
${ 5 0 0 } \mathrm { n g / m L }$ or $1 { , } 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for Methamphetamine, $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ for Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ for Morphine,   
$2 { , } 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for Opiates,   
$1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ for Oxycodone,   
$2 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ for Phencyclidine,   
$3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ for Propoxyphene,   
$1 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for Buprenorphine, and   
$1 , 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for Tricyclic Antidepressants.

These tests can be performed without the use of an instrument.

A positive urine specimen will not generate a colored-line for the specific drug tested in the designated test region.A negative urine specimen or a urine specimen containing of Marijuana, Cocaine, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Amphetamine, Morphine, Opiates, Methadone, Methamphetamine, Phencyclidine, Benzodiazepine, Oxycodone, Propoxyphene, Tricyclic Antidepressants, Buprenorphine and Barbiturate at the concentrations below the designated cutoff levels will generate a colored line in the designated test region for the drug. To serve as a procedural control, a color line will always appear at the control region, indicating that proper volume of specimen has been added and membrane wicking has occurred.

Dear Dr. Tung:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the devicc is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Pleasc be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalencc determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484.
