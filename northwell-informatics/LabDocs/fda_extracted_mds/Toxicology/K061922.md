1. Identification of the Device ; Proprietary-Trade Name : AL-5000 Breath Alcohol Tester Classification Name : Device. breath trapping, alcohol, DJZ Common/ Usual Name : Breath-alcohol test system

2. Equivalence legally marketed devices : AL-5000 is functionally similar to the AlcoMate CA2000. KHN Solution LLC. K041334.

3. Indications for Use ( intended use ) ; AL-5000 is intended to measure alcohol in the human breath. Measurements obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis of alcohol intoxication.

4. Description of the Device ;

AL-5000 is a Breath-alcohol tester designed to measure alcohol in the human breath. And AL-5000 is a D.O.T. approved device and a blow time of 3 seconds is required to capture an accurate deep lung sample. AL-5000 is operated by gas sensor of semi-conductors type for the detection of blood alcohol concentration ( BAC ) from human breath.

The sensor consists of mainly sensing layer and heating element which is formed by a n-type semiconductor powder and heater. respectively. In clean air, during the heater is powered, the oxygen molecules in the air traps the electron in the semiconducting material and then chemisorped on the surface of the powder parlicles. However, when it is exposed to organic vapor such as alcohol. the chemisoped oxygen ( O- or O2- ) is reacted with organic vapor and reduced.

By this reaction. the electrons trapped by oxygen is released and flow in the semiconductor. That is. when is exposed to organic vapor. the electrical conductivity increase ( the resistance decreases ).

# 6. Conclusion :

Through a electrical safety, EMC and DOT tests. we, Sentech Korea Corp.. came to the conclusion that AL-5000 is as safe and effective as the predicate device, has few technological differences. and has no new indications for use. thus rendering it substantial equivalence to the predicate device.

Re: k061922 Trade/Device Name: AL-5000 Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.3050 Regulation Name: Breath-alcohol test system Regulatory Class: Class I Product Code: DJZ Dated: October 5, 2006 Received: October 12, 2006

Dear Ms. Danielson:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations afecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895.
