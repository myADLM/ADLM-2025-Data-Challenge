# I. Device Description:

The device contains a semiconductor oxide sensor to detect the presence of alcohol. The display window displays the alcohol concentration or characters. The alcohol concentration is displayed in increments of $0 . 0 1 \%$ in the range $0 . 0 0 \%$ to $0 . 3 9 \%$ BAC. Characters are used to instruct the user and display the status of the device. The device also includes a beeper to give the user audible prompts.

To use the device, the power on/off button is depressed. The device will turn on and the display will show a countdown to indicate the warm-up. When ready for use the device will show a “READY” light. Users are instructed to exhale sharply and steadily into the mouthpiece for at least four seconds. The device will display WAIT again while it calculates the blood alcohol level. The display will then show the blood alcohol level; after 15 seconds, the device will turn off automatically.

Two replaceable 1.5V AA batteries power the device.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

The sponsor states conformance to the following standards:

Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [NHTSA 59 FR 39382] Highway Safety Programs; Model Specifications for Screening Devices to Measure Alcohol in Bodily Fluids

IEC 61326, Electrical equipment for measurement, control and laboratory use – EMC requirements

# L. Test Principle:

The device contains a semiconductor oxide sensor to detect the presence of alcohol. In the absence of alcohol, while the heater is warming up, oxygen molecules in the air are chemisorbed on the surface of the particles, trapping the electrons in the semi conducting material. When it is exposed to an organic vapor such as ethanol, the chemisorbed oxygen is reduced and releases the trapped electrons. The flow of electrons causes a decrease of resistance, which is measured and converted to $\%$ BAC.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision and accuracy of this device has been demonstrated through testing required by the US Department of Transportation in 59 FR 39382 (Alcohol Screening Devices). For precision and accuracy, these requirements (referred to as Model Specifications for Screening Devices to Measure Alcohol in Bodily Fluids) consist of 20 trials at a Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of 0.008, 20 trials at a BAC of 0.032, and 20 trials at a BAC of 0.000. Blood Alcohol Concentrations are simulated in breath by a Breath Alcohol Sample Simulator (BASS), which provides an alcohol-in-air test sample with known alcohol concentrations, flow rate, and air composition. The acceptance criteria for the Model Specifications are: not more than one negative result at 0.032 BAC, not more than one positive result at 0.008 BAC, and not more than one negative greater than zero and no positives at 0.000 BAC. NOTE: for the purposes of this study, a BAC of 0.020 is used to distinguish a positive from a negative result. The AL-5000 device had no negatives at 0.032 BAC, no positives at 0.008 BAC, and no positives or non-zero negatives at 0.000 BAC.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

This device reports concentrations from $0 . 0 0 \%$ to $0 . 3 9 \%$ . However, DOT Model Specifications require accuracy testing at concentrations of 0.000, 0.008 and 0.032 BAC only; therefore true linearity was not evaluated. This device demonstrated acceptable performance according to the DOT Model Specifications as described above.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): This device is traceable to a commercially available certified alcohol reference solution at a concentration of $0 . 0 5 \%$ BAC & $0 . 1 0 \%$ BAC. This solution is used to calibrate the devices during manufacture.

# d. Detection limit:

The DOT Model Specifications for screening devices do not specifically address the detection limit of breath alcohol devices. However, the devices must be tested at a BAC of zero (blank reading) to assess the possibility of false positives. This consists of 20 trials under normal laboratory conditions at a BAC of 0.000. Non-alcoholic human breath is to be used as the sample. For devices capable of providing a reading of greater than $0 . 0 0 0 \mathrm { B A C }$ and less than 0.020 BAC, the acceptance criterion is: not more than one such result. The AL-5000 device had no false positives in this trial.

e. Analytical specificity:

The DOT Model Specifications for screening devices require testing with cigarette smoke to assess any possible interference.

The manufacturer’s labeling does not instruct the user to wait a specific time after consuming cigarettes before taking a reading, therefore the initial reading was taken within 1 minute as specified in the DOT model specifications. The subject was then asked to smoke another inhalation and repeat the test to produce a total of five trials. The acceptance criterion for this trial is: no positive results. The AL-5000 device had no positive results.

# $f .$ Temperature:

The DOT Model Specifications require testing at $1 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and $4 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to assess any possible effects of temperature.

At $1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 20 trials are required at $0 . 0 0 8 \mathrm { B A C }$ and 20 trials are required at 0.032 BAC. Acceptance criteria are: not more than one positive result at 0.008 BAC, and not more than one non-positive result at 0.032 BAC. The AL-5000 device had no positive results at 0.008 BAC and no non-positive results at 0.032 BAC.

At $4 0 ~ \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , the requirements are identical. Again the AL-5000 device had no positive results at 0.008 BAC and no non-positive results at 0.032 BAC.

# g. Vibration:

The DOT Model Specifications requires vibration testing to assess any possible vibrational effects.

Twenty trials are required at 0.008 BAC and 0.032 BAC. Acceptance criteria are: not more than one positive result at 0.008 BAC, and not more than one non-positive result at 0.032 BAC. The AL-5000 device had no positive results at 0.008 BAC and no non-positive results at 0.032 BAC.

h. Assay Cutoff

For the purposes of performance testing, a BAC cutoff of 0.020 was used to distinguish positive from negative samples. The sponsor states in the labeling that consumption of alcohol in any amount may impair the ability to operate a motor vehicle.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The accuracy of this device is addressed in the precision section above. In addition, the sponsor conducted a consumer study comparing the device to the predicate. The purpose of the study was to determine if consumers could correctly use and interpret the device using only the supplied User’s Manual, and to compare the results to the predicate device. The field test was performed involving 117 people, and the volunteers ranged in age from 20 to $6 0 +$ years of age. Each participant took their breath alcohol reading and recorded the result. Afterward, each participants were administered a breath alcohol test using the predicate device. The breath alcohol concentrations ranged from a BAC of 0.000 to 0.31. Linear regression of the data shows a slope of 0.997, y-intercept of 0 and a correlation coefficient of 0.98.

Also, the participants answered a questionnaire to determine how well they understood the user manual and how to use the device. The results are presented below:
