# Device Description:

Dade Behring Dimension VistaTM Flex $\textcircled{8}$ reagent cartridges are prepackaged in-vitro diagnostic test methods (assays) that are specifically designed to be used on the Dade Behring Dimension VistaTM Integrated system, a floor model, fully automated, microprocessor-controlled, integrated instrument system. The Dimension VistaTM system was previously cleared with seven associated test methods (K 051087). This Special $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ is submitted for a packaging modification to in-vitro diagnostic devices that have been cleared under the 510(k) process for use on Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ clinical chemistry systems. The packaging change is to allow use on the Dimension VistaTM system.

The reagents contained in the Dimension VistaTM Flex $^ { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges are the same as those contained in the Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges manufactured for the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ clinical chemistry systems, another family of Dade Behring analyzers. The packaging modification, does not affect the intended use of the devices, nor does it alter the fundamental scientific technology of the devices.

# Intended Use:

# Digitoxin

The DGTX method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of digitoxin in serum and plasma on the Dimension VistaTM System. Measurements of digitoxin are used in the diagnosis and treatment of digitoxin overdose and in monitoring levels of digitoxin to ensure appropriate therapy.

# Digoxin

The DIG method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of digoxin in serum and plasma on the Dimension VistaTM System. Measurements of digoxin are used in the diagnosis and treatment of digoxin overdose and in monitoring levels of digoxin to ensure appropriate therapy.

# Gentamicin

The GENT method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of gentamicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, in human serum and plasma on the Dimension Vista™M System. Gentamicin measurements may be used in the diagnosis and treatment of gentamicin overdose and in monitoring levels of gentamicin to ensure appropriate therapy.

# N-acetylprocainamide

The NAPA method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of N-acetylprocainamide in serum and plasma on the Dimension VistaTM System. N-acetylprocainamide measurements may be used in therapeutic drug monitoring to maintain adequate procainamide therapy.

# Phenytoin

The PTN method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of phenytoin, (dilantin, diphenylhydantoin), an anti-epileptic drug, in human serum and plasma on the Dimension VistaTM System. Phenytoin measurements may be used in the diagnosis and treatment of phenytoin overdose and in monitoring levels of phenytoin to ensure appropriate therapy.

# Theophylline

The THEO method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of theophylline in human serum and plasma on the Dimension Vista™M System.

# Comparison to Predicate Device:

Both the Dimension VistaTM Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges and the predicate Dimension $\textcircled{8}$ Flex® reagent cartridges contain prepackaged reagents in flexible plastic cartridges. A comparison of the important similarities and differences between the two Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ cartridges is provided in the following table:

# Comments on Substantial Equivalence:

The Dade Behring Dimension Vista™M Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges and the Dimension® Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges are designed similarly for the same purpose. Both contain prepackaged reagents for in-vitro diagnostic tests that are processed on microprocessorcontrolled, integrated instrument systems to analyze a variety of analytes in human specimens.

The reagents contained in the Dimension VistaTM Flex $^ { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges are the same as those contained in the $\mathbf { F l e x } { \otimes }$ reagent cartridges manufactured for the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ clinical chemistry systems, another family of Dade Behring analyzers. The packaging modifications do not affect the intended use of the devices, nor do they alter the fundamental scientific technology of the devices.

Comparative testing described in the protocol included in this submission demonstrates substantially equivalent performance.

# Conclusion:

The Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges, containing reagents for testing DGTX, DIG, GENT, NAPA, PTN, and THEO on the Dimension $\textcircled{8}$ VistaTM Integrated system are substantially equivalent in design, principle, and performance to the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ system Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges. They have the same intended use and indications for use. Comparative testing also demonstrates substantially equivalent performance.
