The kit consists of six vials, three vials of Calibrator A, and three vials of Calibrator B which are ready for use (no preparation is required). The volume per vial is $2 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ for Calibrator A and 2.6 mL for Calibrator B. Intermediate levels are automatically prepared and corresponding values calculated by the Dimension VistaTM System.

# 2. Standards:

CEN 13640 Stability testing of In-Vitro Diagnostic Devices ISO 14971:2000 Medical devices -Application of risk management to medical devices

# K. Performance Characteristics:

1. Stability:

Target shelf life for the Dimension Vista™M System Drugs of Abuse Calibrator is nine months. Calibrator shelf life is determined by comparing results of the product stored at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with control stored at ${ \bf - 2 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ The method is calibrated from this stored material. The $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ material values are recovered versus the calibration. Recovery versus time is monitored and percent change over time is determined. Percent change should be less than or equal to $1 0 \%$ Shelf-life stability (expiration) dating assignment at commercialization reflects the real-time data on file at Dade Behring, Inc.

A vial punctured by the instrument and stored on board is stable for 24 hours.

An open vial not on instrument, but recapped and stored in a refrigerator is stable for 31 days.

For testing, vials are opened /punctured on day zero. For punctured vials, a quantity of calibrator sufficient for multiple calibrations is removed and the vials are recapped, punctured and stored at $2 { \cdot } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ Punctured vials are tested on Day 0, 1, 2, and 8 vs. freshly opened vials. For manually opened vials, half of the volume is removed and vials are recapped and tested on day 32 vs. freshly opened vials.

3.Bottle Value Assignment:

D-Methamphetamine, Secobarbital, Lormetazepam, Benzoylecgonine, Methadone, Morphine, Phencyclidine, 11-nor- $\cdot \Delta ^ { 9 }$ -THC-9-COOH, Propoxyphene, and Methylqualone Reference Material is weighed into drug free normal human urine at five levels and stored at $\mathrm { - 7 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ .

The verification of the Master Lot values are compared against previously approved Master Lot values and $\mathrm { { G C / M S ^ { l } } }$ testing. The approved Master Lot values were assigned with an instrument calibrated with the corresponding standard reference material.

The stock solution is made by adding D-Methamphetamine, Secobarbital, Lormetazepam, Benzoylecgonine, Methadone, Morphine, Phencyclidine, 11-nor- $\cdot \Delta ^ { \mathfrak { g } }$ -THC-9-COOH, Propoxyphene, and Methylqualone Reference Materials gravimetrically to stock solution at target concentrations and verified on an instrument calibrated with a previously approved Master Lot.

The commercial lot is made by adding calculated quantities of stock solution to drug free normal human urine in appropriate concentrations for each of the calibrator levels. The concentration of each level is verified using an instrument calibrated with Master Lot and GC/MS testing of each analyte in the Commercial lot. Values for each analyte are approved once the acceptable ranges for each analyte are met. The commercial lot is then filled, capped, labeled, and packaged.

Dear Mr. Carrio:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations afecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies.
