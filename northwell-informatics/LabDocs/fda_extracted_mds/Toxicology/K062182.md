CEN 13640 Stability testing of In-Vitro Diagnostic Devices ISO 14971 :2000 Medical devices -Application of risk management to medical devices

# K. Performance Characteristics:

1. Stability:

Target shelf life for the Dimension Vista™M System Ecstasy Calibrator is 12 months. Calibrator shelf life is determined by comparing results of the product stored at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ with control stored at ${ \bf - } 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The method is calibrated from this stored material. The $4 \%$ material values are recovered versus the calibration. Recovery versus time is monitored and percent change over time is

determined where the allowable shelf life percent change is ≤ 10 $\%$ Shelf-life stability (expiration) dating assignment at commercialization reflects the real-time data on file at Dade Behring, Inc.

A vial punctured by the instrument and stored on board is stable for 24 hours.

An open vial not on instrument, but recapped and stored in a refrigerator is stable for 31 days.

For testing, vials are opened /punctured on day zero. A quantity sufficient for multiple calibrations is removed and the vials are recapped and stored at $2 - 8 \ { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ Opened/punctured vials are tested on days 0, 1, 2, and 8 and opened vials are also tested at 32 days versus freshly opened vials.

2. Traceability:

The assigned values of the ECTX CAL is traceable to Methylenedioxymethamphetamine $9 9 \%$ purity)(Cerilliant, Inc., 811 Paloma Drive, suite A, Roundrock, TX 78664.

3.Value Assignment:

The new calibrator Master Pool is made by adding weighed quantities of Methylenedioxymethamphetamine Reference Material to drug free human urine. Five levels of Master Pool are prepared and stored at $\mathrm { - 7 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ .The Master Pool values are verified against the values of a previously approved Master Pool lot and Gas Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) testing.

A stock solution is prepared for the new commercial calibrator lot by gravimetrically adding Methylenedioxymethamphetamine to stock solution at target concentration. The stock solution concentration is verified by comparing them to the Master Pool assigned bottle values.

For the commercial calibrator lot, calculated quantity of the stock solution is added to drug free human urine to target concentrations for two calibrator levels. The concentration of each level of the commercial lot is verified to be within acceptable range by using an instrument calibrated with Master Pools and by GC/MS testing.

Re: k062182 Trade/Device Name: Dimension VistaTM System Ectasy Calibrator Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.3200 Regulation Name: Clinical toxicology calibrator Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: DLJ Dated: July 28, 2006 Received: July 31, 2006

Dear Mr. Carrio:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Intemet address
