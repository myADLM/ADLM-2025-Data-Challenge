# 2. Standards:

CEN 13640 Stability testing of In-Vitro Diagnostic Devices ISO 14971:2000 Medical devices -Application of risk management to medical devices

# K. Performance Characteristics:

# 1. Stability:

Target helf le or both he Dimension Vista System Drugs o Abuse Positive Control and the Dimension Vista™M System Drugs of Abuse Negative Control is twelve months. Control shelf life is determined by comparing results of the product stored at $4 \%$ with control stored at ${ \bf \nabla } { \bf \cdot } 2 0 ^ { \circ } { \bf C }$ The method is calibrated from this stored material. The $4 \%$ material values are recovered versus the   
calibration. Recovery versus time is monitored and percent change over time is determined. Percent change is than or equal to $10 \%$ . Shelf-life stability (expiration) dating assignment at   
commercialization reflects the real-time data on file at Dade   
Behring, Inc.   
A vial punctured by the instrument and stored on board is stable for seven days.   
An open vial not on instrument, but recapped and stored in a refrigerator is stable for 31 days.

For testing, vials are opened /punctured on day zero. For punctured vials, a quantity sufficient for multiple tests is removed and the vials are recapped, punctured and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Punctured vials are tested on Day 8, 15, 22, and 32 vs. freshly opened vials.

# 2. Traceability:

The assigned values of the Dimension VistaTM System Drugs of Abuse Positive Control and the Dimension VistaTM System Drugs of Abuse Negative Control are traceable to Gas Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) Reference Testing.

3Bottle Value Assignment:

Calculated quantities of D-Methamphetamine, Secobarbital, Nordiazepam, Benzoylecgonine, Methadone, Morphine, Phencyclidine, and 11-nor- $\cdot \Delta ^ { 9 } \cdot$ THC-9-COOH high purity stock solutions are added to drug free normal human urine to target concentrations for each of the Negative and Positive Controls.

The Negative and Positive Bulk Products are tested by GC/MS'. Values are assigned to the controls once the GC/MS results are in the acceptable ranges.

Dear: Mr. Carrio

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either classII (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2-

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
