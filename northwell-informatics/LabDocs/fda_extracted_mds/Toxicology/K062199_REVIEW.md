# I. Device Description:

DRUG 3 CAL is a frozen, liquid, human whole blood hemolysate containing cyclosporine. The kit consists of six vials, three vials of Calibrator A, and three vials of Calibrator B which are frozen. The volume for Calibrator A is $2 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ per vial and for Calibrator B is $1 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ per vial. Intermediate levels are automatically prepared and corresponding values calculated by the Dimension Vista™ System. Each donor unit used in the preparation of this material was tested by FDA approved methods for the presence of antibodies to HIV-1, HIV-2, Hepatitis B Surface Antigen and antibody to HCV and found to be negative.

L. Test Principle: Not Applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not Applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability The assigned values of the DRUG 3 CAL are traceable to United States Pharmacopeia Cyclosporine A Reference Material.

# Value Assignment

Cyclosporine Reference Material is weighed into drug free whole blood hemolysate to prepare master pools at five levels and stored at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . The verification of the Master Pool values is performed against weighed in Master Pool values and LC/MS testing. The stock solution is made by adding cyclosporine gravimetrically to stock solution at target concentrations. The commercial lot is made by adding calculated quantities of stock solution to drug free whole blood hemolysate to target concentrations for each of the calibrator levels. The concentration of each level is verified by using an instrument. Nominal values are assigned to the commercial lot.

The nominal values for each level of the commercial lot are verified using an instrument calibrated with Master Pools.

# Stability

Target shelf life for the Dimension Vista™ System Drug 3 Calibrator is 12 months. Calibrator shelf life is determined by comparing results of the product stored at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with the reference (control) stored at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . The method is calibrated from this stored reference. The ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ material values are recovered versus the calibration. Recovery versus time is monitored and percent change over time is determined. Shelf-life stability (expiration) dating assignment at commercialization reflects the real-time data on file at Dade Behring, Inc.

A vial punctured by the instrument and stored on board is stable for seven days. An open vial not on instrument, but recapped and stored in a refrigerator is stable for 31 days. For testing, vials are opened /punctured on day zero. A quantity sufficient for multiple calibrations is removed and the vials are recapped and stored at $2 - 8 { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Opened/punctured vials are tested on days 8, 15, 22 and 32 versus freshly opened vials.
