# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): Refer to Indications for Use

2. Indication(s) for use:

The Methamphetamine Enzyme Immunoassays for Drugs of Abuse in Oral Fluid is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay system to detect methamphetamine in human saliva with a cutoff of $4 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ when testing oral fluid specimens collected with a Salivette collector (manufactured by Sarstedt) and diluted with 1 mL of buffer. The calibrators and controls of the analyte (d-methamphetamine) are prepared with oral fluid buffer so that it can be used to verify and validate the assay. The assay is intended for use in the qualitative determination for methamphetamine. The assay is designed for professional use with a number of automated clinical chemistry analyzers.

The Oral Fluid Methamphetamine Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay system provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug-of-abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription, professional use only in clinical chemistry laboratories. The assay is not designated for use in point-of-care settings.

4. Special instrument requirements: The device is designed for use on automated clinical chemistry analyzers. Performance data for this submission was collected using a Hitachi 717 analyzer.

# I. Device Description:

The assay consists of ready-to-use liquid reagents. Reagent 1 contains mouse monoclonal antibodies to methamphetamine, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), stabilizers, and sodium azide as preservative. Reagent 2 contains methamphetamine-labeled glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in buffer with sodium azide as a preservative.

Calibrators for this assay are sold separately and consist of a negative, cutoff, and high calibrator in an oral fluid buffer, ranging in concentration from 0 to $9 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

Assayed negative and positive controls are sold separately and are run with unknown samples to monitor the performance of the assay. They consist of oral fluid to which methamphetamine has been added.

# L. Test Principle:

The assay is based on competition for anti-methamphetamine antibody binding sites between methamphetamine in the sample and methamphetamine conjugated to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). In the absence of free drug in the sample, the antibody binds the conjugated methamphetamine thus decreasing the enzymatic activity of the G6PDH. The G6PDH activity is measured spectrophotometrically at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ due to conversion of NAD to NADH.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

Performance data for this submission was collected using a Hitachi 717 analyzer.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were performed by using the negative, cutoff and high calibrators and two levels of controls. Testing was performed in replicates of 6, twice a day for 10 days for all concentrations. The within-run $\%$ CV ranged from 0.39 to $0 . 6 4 \%$ and the Total precision $\% \mathrm { C V }$ ranged from 0.58 to $0 . 8 0 \%$ .

The recovery study showed that the assay correctly identified spiked samples above the cutoff as positive and below the cutoff as negative.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable. This is a qualitative assay.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

A commercially available standard solution is made into a secondary (lower concentration) stock solution. The secondary stock solution is then spiked into the calibrators and controls to the desired concentration. The concentrations are confirmed by GC/MS.

Stability Studies: Real time and accelerated studies have been conducted. Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims the following expiration date:

When stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } C } }$ product is good until expiration date which is 18 months.

The stability of methamphetamine in the Salivette collection device was determined by taking a pool of negative oral fluid samples spiked at three different concentrations and split into three hundred and thirty samples. On day one 10 samples were run to determine the baseline that subsequent runs were compared to. Of the remaining one hundred samples for each concentration, half were stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } C } }$ and the other half were stored frozen - ${ } . 2 0 \ { } ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ . The study was conducted over 22 days and samples were run on days 1, 2, 8, 12, 15 and 22. The sample is stable for 22 days when stored refrigerated at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } C } }$ or frozen at $- 2 0 ~ ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ .

d. Detection limit:

See the Precision/Reproducibility section above for performance around the stated cutoff concentration.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Various potentially cross-reacting or interfering substances were evaluated to determine whether they interfere with assay results. Test compounds were spiked into the drug-free calibrator to various concentrations and evaluated against the cutoff calibrator. Results were as follows:
