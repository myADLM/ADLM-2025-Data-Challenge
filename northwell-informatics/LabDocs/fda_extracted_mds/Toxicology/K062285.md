# 5. Device description

The VITROS BENZ assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay that is performed using the VITROS Chemistry Products BENZ Reagent with the VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 26, VITROS Chemistry Products FS Calibrator 1, and VITROS Chemistry Products FS Diluent Pack 4 (DAT Diluent / DAT Diluent 2) on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems.

The VITROS BENZ Reagent is a dual chambered package containing ready-to-use liquid reagents that are used to detect benzodiazepines in urine. Sample, calibrators, and controls are automatically treated with surfactant (DAT Diluent 2) prior to addition of reagents. Treated sample is added to Reagent 1 containing antibody reactive to diazepam, glucose-6-phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $( \mathrm { N A D } ^ { + } )$ , followed by Reagent 2 containing diazepam labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH). The assay is based on competition between benzodiazepines in the treated urine sample and diazepam labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH) for antibody binding sites. Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, therefore the concentration of benzodiazepines in the urine sample is directly proportional to measured enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $( \mathsf { N A D } ^ { + } )$ to NADH, resulting in an absorbance change that is measured spectrophotometrically at $3 4 0 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ .

VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 26 is prepared from human urine to which drugs of abuse, metabolites of drugs of abuse, organic salt, surfactants, and preservative have been added. VITROS FS Calibrator 1 is prepared from sodium chloride and processed water. VITROS Calibrator Kit 26 is used in conjunction with VITROS FS Calibrator 1 to calibrate VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems for the qualitative or semi-quantitative measurement of benzodiazepine (BENZ).

VITROS Chemistry Products DAT Performance Verifiers I, II, III, IV and V are prepared from a human urine pool to which analytes, surfactant, and preservative have been added. These are assayed controls used to monitor performance of the VITROS BENZ assay on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems.

The VITROS Chemistry Products FS Diluent Pack 4 (DAT Diluent/ DAT Diluent 2) is a common reagent that is used with several drugs of abuse assays to dilute calibrators and samples on the VITROS 5,1 FS System. This is a dual chambered package containing two ready-to-use liquid diluents. DAT Diluent is prepared from human urine to which organic salt, surfactants, and preservative have been added. DAT Diluent 2 is prepared from processed water to which surfactant and preservative have been added.

5.Device description (continued)

The VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System is a clinical chemistry instrument that provides automated use of the VITROS Chemistry Products MicroTip and MicroSlides® range of products. The VITROS 5,1 FS System was cleared for market by $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification (K031924).

Device intended uses

VITROS Chemistry Products BENZ Reagent: For in vitro diagnostic use only. VITROS Chemistry Products BENZ Reagent is used on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems for the semi-quantitative or qualitative determination of benzodiazepines (BENZ) in human urine using a cutoff of either $2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ or $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . Measurements obtained with the VITROS BENZ method are used in the diagnosis and treatment of benzodiazepines use or overdose.

The VITROS Chemistry Products BENZ assay is intended for use by professional laboratory personnel. It provides only a preliminary test result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used to confirm a result obtained with this assay. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drugof-abuse test result, particularly when evaluating a preliminary positive result.

VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 26: For in vitro diagnostic use only. VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 26 is used to calibrate VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems for the qualitative or semi-quantitative measurement of drugs of abuse.

VITROS Chemistry Products FS Calibrator 1: For in vitro diagnostic use only. VITROS Chemistry Products FS Calibrator 1 is used in conjunction with VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kits to calibrate VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems.

VITROS Chemistry Products DAT Performance Verifiers I, II, III, IV and V: For in vitro diagnostic use only. VITROS Chemistry Products DAT Performance Verifiers are assayed controls used to monitor performance of urine drugs of abuse screening assays on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems.

The VITROS Chemistry Products BENZ assay and VITROS Chemistry Products DAT Performance Verifiers are substantially equivalent to the DADE BEHRING $\mathbf { S y v a } ^ { \textregistered } \mathbf { E M I } ^ { \textcircled { 1 } }$ II Plus Benzodiazepine Assay (K993985) and BIO-RAD Liquichek™M Urine Toxicology Controls (K022707) (predicate devices) which were cleared by the FDA for in vitro diagnostic use.

The performance of the VITROS BENZ assay on the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System was compared to the Syva® EMIT® II Plus Benzodiazepine assay on the $\operatorname { S y v a } ^ { \textcircled { 1 } } 3 0 \mathrm { R }$ Biochemical System. The results demonstrated good agreement between the two immunoassay methods.

The VITROS BENZ assay and the VITROS DAT Performance Verifiers have the following similarities to the predicate devices: the same intended use, the same cutoff values of 200 and $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , consist of liquid, ready to use reagents, have similar performance characteristics, are used on an automated clinical chemistry analyzer and calibrated against the same drug, lormetazepam.
