# Device description

The VITROS OP assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay that is performed using the VITROS Chemistry Products OP Reagent with the VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 26 and VITROS Chemistry Products FS Diluent Pack 4 (DAT Diluent / DAT Diluent 2) on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems. Two protocols using the VITROS OP assay are available to support the two cutoff values. The OP-LO protocol is used to support the $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ cutoff value. The OP-HI protocol is used to support the $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ cutoff value.

The VITROS OP Reagent is a dual chambered package containing ready-to-use liquid reagents that are used to detect opiates in urine. Sample, calibrators, and controls are automatically treated with surfactant (DAT Diluent 2) prior to addition of reagents. Treated sample is added to Reagent I containing antibodies reactive to morphine, glucose-6-phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD\*), followed by Reagent 2 containing morphine labeled with the enzyme glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH). The assay is based on competition between opiates in the treated urine sample and the morphine labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH) for antibody binding sites. Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, therefore the concentration of opiates in the urine sample is directly proportional to measured enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD\*) to NADH, resulting in an absorbance change that is measured spectrophotometrically at $3 4 0 ~ \mathfrak { n m }$

The VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 26 is prepared from human urine to which drugs of abuse, metabolites of drugs of abuse, organic salt, surfactants, and preservative have been added. VITROS Calibrator Kit 26 is a single fluid and from it six dilutions are performed on the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System to create a total of six calibrators. These standards are used to calibrate VITROS 5, 1 FS Chemistry Systems for the qualitative and semi-quantitative measurement of Opiates (OP).

The VITROS Chemistry Products DAT Performance Verifiers I, II, III, IV, and V are quality control materials prepared from a human urine pool to which analytes, surfactant, and preservative have been added. These are assayed controls used to monitor performance of the VITROS OP assay on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems.

The VITROS Chemistry Products FS Diluent Pack 4 (DAT Diluent / DAT Diluent 2) is a common reagent that is used by multiple assays on the VITROS 5, 1 FS Chemistry System. This is a dual chambered package containing two ready-to-use liquid diluents. DAT Diluent is prepared from human urine to which organic salt, surfactants, and preservative have been added. DAT Diluent 2 is prepared from processed water to which surfactant and preservative have been added.

Device intended uses

The VITROS 5, 1 FS Chemistry System is a clinical chemistry instrument that provides automated use of the VITROS Chemistry Products MicroTip® and MicroSlides® range of products. The VITROS 5, I FS System was cleared for market by 510(k) premarket notification (K031924).

VITROS Chemistry Products OP Reagent: For in vitro diagnostic use only. VITROS Chemistry Products OP Reagent is used on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems for the semi-quantitative or qualitative determination of opiates (OP) in human urine using a cutoff of either $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ or $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ Measurements obtained with the VITROS OP method are used in the diagnosis and treatment of opiate use or overdose.

The VITROS Chemistry Products OP assay is intended for use by professional laboratory personnel. It provides only a preliminary test result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used to confirm a result obtained with this assay. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug-of-abuse test result, particularly when evaluating a preliminary positive result.

VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 26: For in vitro diagnostic use only. VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 26 is used to calibrate VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems for the qualitative or semi-quantitative measurement of drugs of abuse.

VITROS Chemistry Products DAT Performance Verifiers I, II, III, IV, and V: For in vitro diagnostic use only. VITROS Chemistry Products DAT Performance Verifiers are assayed controls used to monitor performance of urine drugs of abuse screening assays on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems. .

# 7. Comparison to predicate devices:

The VITROS Chemistry Products OP assay and VITROS Chemistry Products DAT Performance Verifiers are substantially equivalent to the EMIT® I1 Plus Opiate assay (K01 1289) and Bio-Rad Liquicheck™M Urine Toxicology Controls (K022707) predicate devices which were cleared by the FDA for IVD use.

Continued on next page

The performance of the VITROS OP assay on the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System was compared to the $\mathrm { E M I T } ^ { ( \mathrm { i } ) }$ II Plus Opiate assay on the Olympus AU400 Analyzer. The results demonstrated good agreement between the two immunoassay methods.

The VITROS OP assay and VITROS DAT Performance Verifiers have the following similarities to the predicate devices: same intended use, the same cutoff values of 300 or $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , are liquid, ready to use reagents, have similar performance characteristics, are used on an automated clinical chemistry analyzer and calibrated against the same drug, morphine.
