1.Identification of the Device: Proprietary-Trade Name: RMI® LCD Alcohol Tester Classification Name: Device, breath trapping, alcohol, FDA product code DJZ Common/Usual Name: Breath-alcohol test system

2Equivalent legally marketed device: Connectables® Alcohol Tester K052448, AlcoMate CA2000, K041334

3. Indications for Use (intended use) : Intended to measure alcohol in human breath. Measurements obtained by this device are used in the detection of alcohol intoxication

4. Description of the Device: The RMI® LCD Alcohol Tester is designed to measure deep lung air to test for the presence of alcohol in the blood. The relationship between alcohol in the blood and alcohol in the deep lung breath is well established by Henry's law in ratio of 2100:1. The RMl $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ LCD Alcohol Tester is an alcohol screening device and uses a blowing time of 3 seconds to capture an accurate deep lung sample. The RMI® LCD Alcohol Tester contains a semiconductor sensor designed to test for the presence of alcohol. The semiconductor material is heated to a specific temperature. The resistance of sensing material changes rapidly according to gas concentration changes, thereby enabling the reading of alcohol concentration by resistance measurement. The device employs a 3 digit LCD display which shows breath alcohol readings from 0.00 to 0.20 BAC (Breath Alcohol Concentration). Readings above 0.20 will display an LCD reading of "HI." The new device is a MODIFICATION of our old device, the Connectables® Alcohol Tester (K052448). We use the same sensor, but instead of three colored LEDs as indicators, the new device has a three digit LCD display of the measured BAC (breath alcohol concentration). Instead of analog comparators, we now employ an 8 bit microprocessor for control and measurement.

5.Safety and Effectiveness, comparison to predicate device. The results of bench, and user testing indicates that the new device is as safe and effective as the predicate device. A clinical trial was performed to establish that the user could read and understand the instructions provided, and properly use the device.

# .Conclusion

After analyzing bench tests, a risk analysis, electrical safety, and user testing data, it is the conclusion of RESOURCE MANAGEMENT INTERNATIONAL, LLC that the $\mathsf { R M I } \ @$ LCD Alcohol Tester is as safe and effective as the predicate device, has few technological differences, and has no new indications for use, thus rendering it substantially equivalent to the predicate device. The clinical trial performed showed that the over the counter purchaser of this device could read and understand the instructions, could properly use the device, and obtain results that were comparable to those provided by a predicate unit administered by a trained observer.
