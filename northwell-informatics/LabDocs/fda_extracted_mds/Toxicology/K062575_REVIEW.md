# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indications for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use:

Immunoassay for the qualitative detection of methamphetamine, opiates, cocaine metabolite, THC metabolite, phencyclidine, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants, methadone, and amphetamine in human urine to assist in screening of drug of abuse samples. The detecting cut-off concentrations are as follows:

MET D-Methamphetamine 1000 ng/mL OPI Morphine 300 ng/mL COC Benzoylecgonine 300 ng/mL THC 11-nor- $\cdot \Delta ^ { 9 }$ -9-carboxylic acid 50 ng/mL PCP Phencyclidine 25 ng/mL Benzodiazepine Oxazepam 300 ng/mL Barbiturate Secobarbital 300 ng/mL Methadone Methadone 300 ng/mL TCA Nortriptyline 1000 ng/mL AMP D-Amphetamine 1000 ng/mL

This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)/ High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, for TCA) are the preferred confirmatory methods. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are obtained.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only.

Certain foods or medications containing opiates or opiate derivatives, amphetamines, methamphetamine, barbiturate, benzodiazepines, or tricyclics may produce a positive result in any chemical or immunological assay. Poppy seeds can contain opiates or ingestion of products containing poppy seeds can cause a positive result.

4. Special instrument requirements: For use with the DXpress Reader or as a visually read test.

# L. Test Principle:

The AccuSign RC•DOA10 test uses solid-phase chromatographic membrane immunoassay technology for the qualitative, simultaneous detection of methamphetamine, opiates, cocaine, THC, phencyclidine, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, methadone, tricyclic antidepressants, and amphetamine in human urine. The test relies on competitive binding of the antibodies between drug conjugate and drug which may be present in the urine sample. A sample of urine is placed in the sample well of the device and is allowed to migrate upward. If the drug is present in the urine sample, it competes with the drug conjugate, which is bound to the dye, for the limited antibodies immobilized on the membrane. If the drug or drug metabolite levels are above the cutoff level, the drug will saturate the antibodies, thus inhibiting the binding of the dye coated with drug conjugates to the antibodies on the membrane. This prevents the formation of a line on the membrane. Therefore, a preliminary drug-positive urine sample will not generate a line in the test window, indicating a positive result from positive drug competition, while a negative urine sample will generate a line in the test window, indicating a negative result from an absence of competition with free drugs.

In addition to the Test line that may appear in the Test window (T), a Control line is present in the Control window (C) which should always appear if sufficient sample volume is used applied and the sample migrates correctly up the test strip membrane.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The sponsor conducted precision studies for each drug on the DOA 10 panel. Spiked urine controls with concentrations of 0, $50 \%$ below cutoff, $2 5 \%$ below cutoff, cutoff, $+ 2 5 \%$ above cutoff, $50 \%$ above cutoff and $100 \%$ above cutoff levels were tested. Ten devices at each concentration were tested on three readers for two days with two lots of test devices by three operators (total 40 tests per level, per operator). The samples were aliquoted and randomly given to operators for a blind study. The test result was visually read at 5 minutes after adding urine sample and then immediately read with the DXpress reader. There were no significant differences between readers, operators, between days or between lots for the ten tests on the panel.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable for a qualitative assay.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): This device has internal process controls. A colored line appearing in the control region confirms that sufficient sample volume was added and that the sample migrated correctly up the test strip membrane.. Users are informed not to interpret the test if a colored line failed to appear in the control region. External controls are not supplied with this device. The sponsor recommends the use of commercially available controls to be used with the DXpress Reader. The DXpress reader will report “Control:Valid” and test result only if the internal process controls are satisfied.

Stability testing of the test strips was previously reviewed under k983501. To validate this claim using both the reader and strips visually read, the sponsor performed additional stability studies. The results from these studies showed expected results for all concentrations and support the sponsor real time 15 month stability claim.

# d. Detection limit:

A cutoff value validation study (see precision section above for a summary of the data) was conducted at seven different drug concentrations to include 0, $+ / - 5 0 \%$ of the cutoff, $+ / - 7 5 \%$ of the cutoff, the cutoff and $+ 1 0 0 \%$ of the cutoff. The samples used were GC/MS or HPLC confirmed. Three operators were used to analyze two assay lots. The results demonstrate performance at the sponsor’s chosen cutoffs of methamphetamine as $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , opiates as $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , cocaine as $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , THC as $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , PCP as $2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , benzodiazepine as $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , barbiturate as $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , methadone as 300 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , TCA as $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , amphetamine as $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

Additionally, the sponsor tested many common substances and biological materials (104) for cross-reactivity with the drug of abuse tests at a concentration of $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ in drug-free and drug positive urines. The sponsor states that they was no cross-reactivity detected with the visual tests. The compounds are listed in the package insert.

# e.3 Urinary pH

The effect of urine sample $\mathsf { p H }$ on the assay result was examined. The pH 4.5 to $\mathsf { p H } 8 . 5$ urine samples were tested with concentrations of $50 \%$ cutoff level and $1 5 0 \%$ cutoff level for each drug. At each $\mathsf { p H }$ and each concentration the test was repeated 10 times. There was no discrepancy from expected in the results with different pHs and showed that there was no interference from urine pH ranging from 3 to 9.

# e.4. Specific gravity

The effect of specific gravity of urine samples on the test result was examined. The urine samples with specific gravity 1.002 and 1.04 were tested at $50 \%$ cutoff level and $1 5 0 \%$ cutoff levels for each drug. At each specific gravity and each concentration the test was repeated ten times. There was no discrepancy from expected in the results with different specific gravity and showed that there was no interference from specific gravity.

f. Assay cut-off:

Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff concentration appears in the precision above.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The performance of AccuSign® RC·DOA10 was evaluated in comparison to the result of GC/MS (HPLC for TCA). Over 40 clinical samples which contain drugs were tested and the results were compared to the GC/MS or HPLC values. Additionally, the sponsor tested 100 drug negative samples were collected from people who apparently were not taking the drug. All test results were read visually and with the DXpress reader. There was no significant difference between the reader and the visual test results. The table below lists the compounds analyzed by GC/MS or HPLC and the results of the method comparison study.
