VITROS Chemistry Products METD Reagent VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 26 VITROS Chemistry Products DAT Performance Verifiers I, II, III, IV & V

Common Names: Methadone (METD) assay and controls

Classification Names:   
Methadone test system (862.3620) Class II   
Clinical toxicology calibrators (862.3200) Class II   
Clinical toxicology control material (862.3280) Class I, VITROS DAT Performance Verifiers are assayed controls, so they meet the reserved criteria under Section 510(l) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

# 4 Predicate Devices

The VITROS Chemistry Products METD assay is substantially equivalent to the EMIT® 1 Plus Methadone Assay.

The VITROS Chemistry Products DAT Performance Verifiers are substantially equivalent to the BIO-RAD Liquichek™ Urine Toxicology Controls.

# 5. Device description

The VITROS METD assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay that is performed using the VITROS Chemistry Products METD Reagent in conjunction with the VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 26 and VITROS Chemistry Products FS Diluent Pack 4 (DAT Diluent/DAT Diluent 2) on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems.

The VITROS METD Reagent is a dual chambered package containing ready-to-use liquid reagents that are used to detect methadone in urine. Sample, calibrators, and controls are automatically treated with surfactant (DAT Diluent 2) prior to addition of reagents. Treated sample is added to Reagent 1 containing antibodies reactive to methadone, glucose-6-phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $( \mathsf { N A D } ^ { + } )$ followed by Reagent 2 containing methadone labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH). The assay is based on competition between methadone in the treated urine sample and the methadone labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH) for antibody binding sites. Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, therefore the concentration of methadone in the urine sample is directly proportional to measured enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD\*) to NADH, resulting in an absorbance change that is measured spectrophotometrically at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .

VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 26 is prepared from human urine to which drugs of abuse, metabolites of drugs of abuse, organic salt, surfactants, and preservative have been added. VITROs Calibrator Kit 26 is a single fluid and from it six dilutions are performed by the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System to create a total of six calibrators. These standards are used to calibrate VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems for the qualitative or semi-quantitative measurement of methadone (METD).

VITROS Chemistry Products DAT Performance Verifiers I, II, III, IV and V are prepared from a human urine pool to which analytes, surfactant, and preservative have been added. These are assayed controls used to monitor performance of the VITROS METD assay on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems.

The VITROS Chemistry Products FS Diluent Pack 4 (DAT Diluent/ DAT Diluent 2) is a common reagent that is used with several drugs of abuse assays to dilute calibrators and samples on the VITROS 5,1 FS System. This is a dual chambered package containing two ready-to-use liquid diluents. DAT Diluent is prepared from human urine to which organic salt, surfactants, and preservative have been added. DAT Diluent 2 is prepared from processed water to which surfactant and preservative have been added.

5. Device description (continued)

The VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System is a clinical chemistry instrument that provides automated use of the VITROS Chemistry Products MicroTip® and MicroSlides® range of products. The VITROS 5,1 FS System was cleared for market by 510(k) premarket notification (K031924).

# 6. Device intended uses

VITROS Chemistry Products METD Reagent: For in vitro diagnostic use only. VITROS Chemistry Products METD Reagent is used on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems for the semi-quantitative or qualitative determination of methadone (METD) in human urine using a cutoff of either $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ or $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Measurements obtained with the VITROS METD method are used in the diagnosis and treatment of methadone use or overdose.

The VITROS Chemistry Products METD assay is intended for use by professional laboratory personnel. It provides only a preliminary test result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used to confirm a result obtained with this assay. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drugof-abuse test result, particularly when evaluating a preliminary positive result.

VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 26: For in vitro diagnostic use only. VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 26 is used to calibrate VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems for the qualitative or semi-quantitative measurement of drugs of abuse.

VITROS Chemistry Products DAT Performance Verifiers I, II, III, IV and V: For in vitro diagnostic usc only. VITROS Chemistry Products DAT Performance Verifiers are assayed controls used to monitor performance of urine drugs of abuse screening assays on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems.

7. Comparison to predicate devices

The VITROS Chemistry Products METD assay and VITROS Chemistry Products DAT Performance Verifiers are substantially equivalent to the EMIT® II Plus Methadone Assay (K010962) and BIO-RAD Liquichek™M Urine Toxicology Controls (K022707) (predicate devices) which were cleared by the FDA for in vitro diagnostic use.

The performance of the VITROS METD assay on the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System was compared to the EMIT® II Plus Methadone assay on the OLYMPUS® AU400 System. The results demonstrated good agreement between the two immunoassay methods.

The VITROS METD assay and the VITROS DAT PerformanCe Verifiers have the following similarities to the predicate devices: the same intended use, the same cutoff values of 150 and $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , consist of liquid, ready to use reagents, have similar performance characteristics, are used on an automated clinical chemistry analyzer and calibrated against the same drug, methadone.
