# Product Name:

Common Name: Quest Diagnostics Urine Cocaine Metabolite ElA Trade Name: Quest Diagnostics Urine Cocaine Metabolite EIA Classification Number: 862.3250

Substantially Equivalent Device: Product: DAT II Cocaine II Manufactured by: Roche Diagnostics Cooperation 510(k) Number: K023281

# Product Description:

Quest Diagnostics Urine Cocaine Metabolite EIA is a competitive homogenous enzyme immunoassaj for the determination of cocaine metabolites in urine specimens.

# Intended Use:

for the qualitative detecion  benzolegonine, the primary ccaiemetabolite, i ur um specimens on automated clinical chemistry analyzers.

# Comparison:

Quest Diagnostics Urine Cocaine Metabolite ElA, when used to qualitatively determine benzoylecgonine in urine specimens, is substantially equivalent to the DAT II Cocaine II assay manufactured by Roche Diagnostics Cooperation.

# Comparison Performance Data:

Performance characteristic studies on precision, analytical sensitivity, interference and antibody cross-reactivity showed that the Quest Diagnostics Urine Cocaine Metabolite EIA is substantially equivalent to the DAT II Cocaine II assay.

Results screened from patient specimens with both the Quest Diagnostics Urine Cocaine Metabolite EIA and the DAT II Cocaine II assay also showed that the qualitative results from this two test systems are substantially equivalent when using GC/MS results as reference.

# Conclusion:

Quest Diagnostics Urine Cocaine Metabolite EIA can be used to qualitatively screen benzoylecgonine, the primary cocaine metabolite, in human urine specimens.

Dear Mr. Yu:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class ⅡI (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations afecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with al the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification.The DA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a lally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address

# Indications for Use

510(k) Number (if known): K062929

Device Name: Quest Diagnostics Urine Cocaine Metabolite EIA

Indications For Use:

The Quest Diagnostics Urine Cocaine Metabolite ElA is intended for the qualitative detection of benzoylecgonine, the primary metabolite of cocaine, in human urine on automated clinical chemistry analyzers. It is a screen test with cutoffs of 300 ng/ml and 150 ng/ml of benzoylecgonine per ml of urine. This test is intended for laboratory use only. For in vitro diagnostic use.

The Quest Diagnostics Urine Cocaine Metabolite ElA provides only a preliminary result. Clinical consideration and professional judgment must be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly in evaluating a preliminary positive result. To obtain confirmed analytical results a more specific alternate chemical method is needed. Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) is the recommended confirmatory method.

The Quest Diagnostics Urine Cocaine Metabolite EIA Calibrators are intended for medical purposes and for use only with the Quest Diagnostics Urine Cocaine Metabolite ElA to establish points of reference that are used in the determination of values in the measurement of benzoylecgonine in urine.   
The Quest Diagnostics Urine Cocaine Metabolite EIA Controls are intended for use as an assay quality control matrix to monitor the precision and accuracy of the laboratory testing procedures for benzoylecgonine.
