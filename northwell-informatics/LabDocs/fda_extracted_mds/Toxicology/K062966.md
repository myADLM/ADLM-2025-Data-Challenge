# LEGALLY MARKETED DEVICE TO WHICH EQUIVALENCY IS CLAIMED

QMS® Zonisamide assay (K051211)

# DESCRIPTION OF DEVICE

The QMs® Lamotrigine assay system is a homogeneous assay utilizing particle agglutination technology and is based on the competitive binding principle.

The assay consists of reagents R1: anti-Lamotrigine sheep polyclonal antibody and R2: Lamotriginecoated microparticles. A six-level set of $\ Q M S ^ { \otimes }$ Lamotrigine Calibrators (A through F) is used to calibrate the assay. A three-level set of $\tt a M S ^ { \otimes }$ Lamotrigine Controls (1 through 3) is used for quality control of the assay.

# SUMMARY OF CLINICAL TESTING

# Accuracy and Linearity

Accuracy and linearity were determined by a study based on the NCCLS guideline EP6: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement.

# Sensitivity

The Functional Sensitivity or Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) of the assay was determined to be $2 . 0 \mu g / m L$ .

# Assay Range

Based on the Accuracy, Linearity, and Sensitivity (LDD and LOQ) data, the package insert claim for the reportable range for the assay is 2.0 to $4 0 . 0 \mu \ g / m L$ .

# Method Comparison

Correlation studies were conducted using NCCLS Guideline EP9: Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples as a guideline to compare accuracy of recovery of Lamotrigine in serum and plasma assayed by the QMS® Lamotrigine assay to an HPLC reference method.

# Precision

A precision study was performed using the National Committe for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) guideline EP5: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices.

# Specificity

There is one pharmacologically inactive metabolite, N-2 glucuronide. Three other minor metabolites, N-5 glucuronide, N-2 oxide, and N-2 methyl have been proposed in literature.Testing resuits indicated that for N-2 oxide there is cross-reactivity, however, this metabolite is present in human serum in only very minor concentrations. No studies to date have been able to quantify the N-2 oxide metabolite in serum due to its extremely low concentration. Results for the other metabolites indicated that there is no significant cross-reactivity.

# Interferences

Interference studies were conducted using NCCLS Guideline EP7: Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry. The results of the study indicated that of 26 drugs tested, none showed cross-reactivity in the QMS lamotrigine assay system.

# CONCLUSION

As summarized above, the ${ \mathsf { Q M S } } ^ { \otimes }$ Lamotrigine assay is substantially equivalent to the QMS Zonisamide assay. Substantial equivalence has been demonstrated through performance testing to verify that the device functions as intended and that design specifications have been salisfied.

Dear Mr. Rogers:

This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of January 12, 2007. We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
