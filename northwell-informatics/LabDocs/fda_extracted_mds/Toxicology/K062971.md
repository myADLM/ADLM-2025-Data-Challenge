5.3 Device: Trade or Proprietary Name:

Breath Alcohol  ® .02 Detection System BreathScan® .02 Breath Alcohol Detection System Common or usual Name: Breath-alcohol test Classification Name: Devices, Breath Trapping, Alcohol Product Code: DJZ Regulation Number: 862.3050

# 5.4 Predicate Device:

Breath Alcohol $\mathbf { \overline { { e } } } \mathbf { \overline { { / } } } \mathbf { \overline { { \otimes } } }$ .02 Detection System and BreathScan®.02 Breath Alcohol Detection System are equivalent to: CONNECTABLES® Alcohol Tester manufactured by Connectables, LLC in Waukegan, IL (K052448).

# 5.5 Indications for Use

The Breath Alcohol ® .02 Detection System and BreathScan® .02 Breath Alcohol Detection System are in vitro medical devices that qualitatively detect the presence of alcohol in the human breath. The test system detects equal to or greater than 0.02 percent breath alcohol. The system is used only as a screening device and is only an indication of the possible presence of alcohol in the blood of the test subject.

The Breath Alcohol $z ^ { \circled { \mathfrak { P } } }$ .02 Detection System and BreathScan® .02 Breath Alcohol Detection System are a visual qualitative test for alcohol in the human breath. The Breath Alcohol $| \mathbf { \mathcal { C } } | ^ { \otimes }$ .02 Detection System and BreathScan® .02 Breath Alcohol Detection System consist of a self-contained electronic analyzer to qualitatively detect the presence of alcohol in the human breath. It is a reusable device designed for use with a specific lot of Breath Alcohol ${ \bf \delta E ^ { ( B ) } }$ .02 or BreathScan® .02 Detectors. The detectors are disposable screening devices designed for one time use. The Breath Alcohol $\overline { { \mathbf { z } } } \widehat { \mathbf { \xi } } ^ { \widehat { \otimes } }$ .02 and BreathScan® .02 Elecoicnalyz nable    terpet  Bre Alco .02 or BreathScan® .02 Detectors charged by human breath. The system provides an indication of the possible presence of alcohol in the blood of the test subject.

The detectors contains chemicals that change color in the presence of alcohol vapors) utilizing the patented technology (US Patent No. 4,740,475). The Detector consists of two parts. One part is a glass capsule containing light yellow crystals that change color when exposed to alcohol vapors. The other part is a plugged, plastic tube with an opening to blow into while running the test.

If alcohol is present, the crystals will change from yellow to light green/blue. How many crystals turn color will depend on the cut-off of the Detector and how much alcohol is in the breath.

The yellow crystals in the Detector are coated with potassium dichromate $( \mathsf { K } _ { 2 } \mathbf { C } \mathbf { r } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O } _ { 7 } )$ and sulfuric acid $\mathrm { ( H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S O } _ { 4 } \mathrm { ) }$ . The amount of these indicator chemicals is adjusted according to the selected cutoff of the Detector. A color change is produced when alcohol vapors are oxidized to acetic acid and the indicator chemicals change to chromium sulfate $[ \mathrm { C r } _ { 2 } ( \mathrm { S O } _ { 4 } ) _ { 3 } ]$ . The majority of crystals change from yellow to light aqua (greenish-blue/bluish-green) when alcohol vapors are present at a level equal to or exceeding the cutoff of the Detector.

The blow bags are re-usable and serve as a method to assure that the subject has blown through the Detector with adequate air. With the Breath Alcohol $\mathbf { \chi } ^ { \prime \prime }$ .02 Detection System, this is required (DOT/NHTSA compliance) and is listed as an option in the BreathScan® .02 Breath Alcohol Detection System.

The Breath Alcohol $a ^ { \circledast }$ .02 and BreathScan® .02 Electronic Analyzers are selfcontained, sealed devices where the Breath Alcohol $\mathbf { \delta } \mathbf { \overline { { e } } } \mathbf { \delta } ^ { \otimes }$ or BreathScan® Detector charged with human breath is inserted into the device to begin the reading process. The internal make-up of the Electronic Analyzer is the same for both models. The only difference is how the detector is positioned or inserted into the device. Using the Breath Alcohol $\overline { { \mathbf { u } } } ^ { \circledast }$ .02 Detection System, the detector is inserted into a sample port; whereas using the BreathScan® .02 Breath Alcohol Detection System, the detector is placed in a nested holder.

The Electronic Analyzer automatically turns on and the lights will flash instantaneously, indicating the respective result. The device comes pre-calibrated $\mathbf { \delta } _ { \mathbf { \overline { { E } } \overline { { A } } } } \otimes$ .02 Detector lot being "read" in the analyzer. A negative result is indicated by a continuously flashing green LED and a positive result is indicated by a continuously flashing red LED.

# 5.7 Safety and Effectiveness

The bench test and user testing data indicated that the Breath Alcohol $\mathbf { \delta } \mathbf { \overline { { z } } } \mathbf { \mathcal { P } }$ .02 Detection System and BreathScan® .02 Breath Alcohol Detection System are safe and effective as an evidentiary breath test, the ALCO SENSOR IV manufactured by Intoximeters, Inc. which is a DOT/NHTSA approved device (Conforming Products List of Evidentiary Breath Measurement Devices - FR/Vol.69, No.134/July 2004/Notices/42237).

User studies were performed to establish that the user could read and understand the directions provided and properly use the devices (Tables 1 and 2).
