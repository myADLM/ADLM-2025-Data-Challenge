# Legally Marketed Predicate Device(s)

The LZI Oral Fluid Amphetamine-Specific Enzyme Immunoassay is substantially equivalent to the Amphetamine-Specific Intercept $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Micro-plate ElA (K992918) manufactured by OraSure Technologies Inc. (formerly known as STC Technologies, Inc) for its general intended use. The current subject device is also substantially equivalent to other LZI test systems cleared by FDA, e.g., the Oral Fluid Cocaine (K050945), Opiate (K050988), and Methadone (K051058) Homogeneous Enzyme Immunoassay for its stated intended use.

# Device Description

LZI's Oral Fluid Amphetamine-Specific Enzyme Immunoassay is a ready-to-use, liquid reagent, homogeneous enzyme immunoassay. The assay uses specific antibodies that can detect amphetamine in oral fluid with minimal cross-reactivity to various, common prescription drugs and abused drugs. The assay is based on competition between drug labeled with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) enzyme and free drug from the saliva sample for a fixed amount of specific antibody. In the absence of free drug from the saliva sample the specific antibody binds to the drug labeled G6PDH enzyme causing a decrease in enzyme activity. It is therefore the drug concentration is proportional to the enzyme activity. The G6PDH enzyme activity is determined spectrophotometrically at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ by measuring its ability to covert nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH.

# Intended Use

The Amphetamine-Specific Enzyme Immunoassays for Drugs of Abuse in Oral Fluid is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay system to detect amphetamine in human saliva with a cutoff of $4 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ when testing oral fluid specimen collected with Salivette collector (manufactured by Sarstedt) and diluted with 1 mL of buffer. The calibrators and controls of the analyte (d-amphetamine) are prepared with oral fluid buffer so that it can be used to verify and validate the assay. The assay is intended for use in the qualitative determination for amphetamine. The assay is designed for professional use with a number of automated clinical chemistry analyzers.

The Oral Fluid Amphetamine-Specific Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay system provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug-of-abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.
