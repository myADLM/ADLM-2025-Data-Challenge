# Description of Device

The IMMULITE 2000, IMMULITE 2500 Vancomycin assay is a solid phase competitive chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay. The solid phase (bead) is coated with ligandlabeled vancomycin. The reagent contains alkaline phosphatase (bovine calf intestine) conjugated to monoclonal murine antivancomycin. Vancomycin in the patient sample competes with the ligand-labeled solid phase for vancomycin binding sites on the monoclonal murine anti-vancomycin enzyme conjugate. The excess sample and reagent are removed by a centrifugal wash. Finally, chemiluminescent substrate is added to the bead and signal is generated in proportion to the bound enzyme. The assay includes an automatic on-board predilution of 1/20 prior to immunoreaction. Immunoreaction incubation time is 30 minutes. The sample volume required is $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ for the test and 250 $\mu \mathrm { L }$ dead volume. The sample types are serum and plasma (heparin or EDTA).

Vancomycin Adjustors for the IMMULITE 2000/IMMULITE 2500: Adjustors are used to correlate the signal counts per second (CPS) of the IMMULITE platform instrument in the user's lab to those of the Master Curve and to acount for the changes in reagent enzyme activity and/or operating conditions. The Vancomycin Adjustors, included in the reagent kit, are two levels (Low and High) of lyophilized vancomycin in a human serum/buffer matrix.

Function of Calibrators and Adjustors in the IMMULITE Family of Instruments: In all IMMULITE platform instruments, calibrators are used at the site of manufacture to establish the Master Curve, which is encoded in the kit barcode label.The calibrators are not provided to the customers because the calibration of a specific kit lot is completed at the DPC manufacturing site. Adjustors are used to correlate the signal counts per second (CPS) of the particular IMMULITE instrument in the user's lab to those of the Master Curve and to account for the changes in reagent enzyme activity and/or operating conditions. The quality of the adjustment is monitored by reviewing the slope and the intercept of the adjustment process, not the target values of the adjustors. Thc acceptance criteria of the slope and the intercept are specified in the Acceptability Criteria section in the specific IMMULITE platform instrument Operator's Manual. Therefore, concentrations of the adjustors are not provided to customers.

# Reportable Range

The reportable range for the IMMULITE 2000/IMMULITE 2500 Vancomycin assay 3- $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

# Limit of Blank

The determination of Limit of Blank was guided by Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI). Protocols for the Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline. CLSI document EP17-A Vol 24 No 34. CLSI, 940 West Valley Road, Suite 1400, Wayne, Pennsylvania 19087-1898 USA, 2004.

This guideline defines Limit of Blank (LoB) as the mean or (more conservatively) the highest value expected to be seen in a series of results for samples that contain no analyte.

Sixty replicates of a zero analyte heparin plasma and serum sample as well as the assay zero calibrator were assayed in 3 IMMULITE 2000 kit lots using 3 IMMULITE 2000 instruments per lot and in one IMMULITE $2 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { k i t }$ lot using 3 instruments per lot in one run per sample type/lot/instrument. IMMULITE 2000/IMMULITE 2500 Vancomycin has a competitive assay format with decreasing chemiluminescent output associated with increasing vancomycin concentration. Limit of Blank (LoB) was computed parametrically as the mean chemiluminescent output measured in counts per second (CPS) minus $1 . 6 5 ~ ^ { * }$ total $\operatorname { S D } _ { \operatorname { C P S } }$ for each instrument, kit lot, and sample type. The computed $\tt L o B _ { \mathrm { C P S } }$ were then transformed into vancomycin doses. The aggregate results were assessed for the most conservative package insert claim.

The LoB claim for the IMMULITE 2000 and IMMULITE 2500 is $0 . 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

# Limit of Detection

The determination of Limit of Detection was guided by Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI). Protocols for the Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline. CLSI document EP17-A Vol 24 No 34. CLSI, 940 West Valley Road, Suite 1400, Wayne, Pennsylvania 19087-1898 USA, 2004. This guideline defines the Limit of Detection (LoD) as the actual concentration at which an observed test result is likely to exceed the Limit of Blank (LoB) and may therefore be declared as detected. The general formula for $\mathrm { L o D } = \mathrm { L o B } + 1 . 6 5 * \mathrm { S D }$

Five different samples with relevant low concentrations of vancomycin at the range greater than LoB to $4  { \mathrm { ~ \textrm ~ { ~ ~ } ~ } }  { \mathrm { L o B } }$ $( > 0 . 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ to $1 . 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ werc assayed using 3 IMMULITE 2000 kit lots on 2 IMMULITE 2000 instruments per lot and using one IMMULITE 2500 kit lot using 2 instruments. Eight runs of 2 replicates per sample were completed on 8 separate days. The sample-specific LoD was calculated as $\mathrm { \Omega } \mathrm { L o B } \mathrm { ~ + ~ } 1 . 6 5 \mathrm { ~ ^ { * } ~ }$ EY $\mathrm { S D _ { \mathrm { { s a m p l e } } } }$ for each sample on each instrument used for each kit lot. The aggregate results were assessed for the most conservative package insert claim.

Thc LoD claim for the IMMULITE 2000 and IMMULITE 2500 is $0 . 9 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$

# Precision

Precision performance studies were guided by CLSI document EP5-A2 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Methods; Approved Guideline-Second Edition. CLSl document EP5-A2 (ISBN 1-56238-000-0). CLSI, 940 West Valley Road, Suite 1400, Wayne, Pennsylvania 19087-1898 USA, 2004.

The study was conducted using thrce different kit lots on the IMMULITE 2000 platform and one lot on the IMMULITE 2500, assaying two aliquots of each test sample in two runs per day over 20 different days (not necessarily consecutive) for a total of 80 replicates per test sample per lot. Two instruments were used per lot.

Precision pools targeted clinically important cut-off values. Since the peak therapeutic range of vancomycin is from $2 5 { \mathord { - } } 4 0 \ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ , the therapeutic trough levels range from 510 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ , and trough toxicity may be of concern at levels above $1 0 ~ \mu \xi / \mu \mathrm { L }$ , precision pools targeted 5, 10, 20, 30, and $4 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ .

For the IMMULITE 2000, maximum statistics across 3 lots using 2 instruments per lot indicate that intra- and inter-assay $\mathrm { C V \% }$ over the range of approximately 5 to $4 7 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ are not greater than $1 0 . 2 \%$ and $6 . 8 \%$ , respectively.

For the IMMULITE 2500, maximum statistics for one kit lot using 2 instruments indicate that intra- and inter-assay $C V \%$ over the range of approximately 5 to $4 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ are not greater than $6 . 1 \%$ and $6 . 0 \%$ , respectively.

# Linearity

Dilutions of 10 patient samples (neat, 4 in 8, 2 in 8 and 1 in 8) across the therapeutic range of the assay (9 to $4 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ ) were assayed in the IMMULITE 2000/IMMULITE 2500 Vancomycin assay in triplicate with the mean taken as the final result. Average recovery $\%$ observed/expected) for patient samples tested in the IMMULITE 2000/IMMULITE 2500 Vancomycin assay was $9 6 . 0 \%$ .

# Spiked Recovery

Spiked recovery experiments test the ability of an assay to quantitatively recover added analyte. Average $\%$ recovery for 6 patient sample pools spiked with various concentrations of 3 different spiking solutions were tested in the IMMULITE 2000/IMMULITE 2500 Vancomycin assay. The average $\%$ recovery for these spiked patient samples was $101 \%$ .

# Interfering Substances

The IMMULITE 2000/IMMULITE 2500 Vancomycin assay was tested for interference by bilirubin, hemoglobin and triglycerides.

Presence of conjugated or unconjugated bilirubin in concentrations up to 20 mg/dL has no effect on results within the precision of the assay.

Presence of hemoglobin in concentrations up to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ has no effect on results within the precision of the assay.

Presence of triglycerides in concentrations up to $3 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ has no effect on results within the precision of the assay.

# Cross-Reactivity

Potential serum cross-reactants were spiked at concentrations listed in the following table into a neat normal human serum sample and a human serum sample spiked with 25 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ vancomycin. The IMMULITE 2000/IMMULITE 2500 Vancomycin assay is highly specific for vancomycin. Results are presented below for potential cross-reactants tested in the vancomycin-spiked human serum sample. There was no detectable crossreactivity to the materials tested.

# Alternate Sample Types

Thc IMMULITE 2000/IMMULITE 2500 Vancomycin assay is indicated for use in serum and plasma. A sample type correlation study assessed the degree of equivalence between serum and heparinized plasma, EDTA plasma, and SST scrum.

Matched sets of human serum, SST, lithium heparin and EDTA samples spiked with various concentrations of vancomycin to obtain values from $< 3 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ to $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ were assayed. Each individual sample was run in duplicate and the mean taken as the final result. Regression analyses are presented below.

# Assay Kit Stability

Kit stability testing was conducted on multiple lots of the IMMULITE 2000/IMMULITE 2500 Vancomycin assay and included the following assessments:

Real-time stability at long term package insert storage conditions

Stress (accelerated) conditions to simulate storage/stress conditions that might occur during shipment to and storage at customer facilities. Stress studies also support real-time stability.

$\bigcirc$ 3-Day storage at $3 7 ^ { \circ } C$   
$\bigcirc$ 7-Day storage at room temperature $( 1 5 . 3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$   
0 3 Freeze/thaw cycles (freeze $\mathrm { - 3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C } }$ to ${ } _ { - 5 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , thaw at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

To date, results of real-time and accelerated stress studies support the claim of 360 days shelf life for the IMMULITE 2000/IMMULITE 2500 Vancomycin assay kits when stored at $2 { \cdot } 8 { ^ \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Clinical Sample Population

The following assay methods were compared using endogenous serum from patients being treated with vancomycin. Multiple IMMULITE 2000 and IMMULITE 2500 instruments were used. Results are presented below comparing 162 endogenous serum patient Vancomycin levels in the IMMULITE 2000 versus the predicate AxSYM Vancomycin II and IMMULITE 2500 versus the predicate AxSYM Vancomycin II. Results show high correlation $( \mathrm { r } { = } 0 . 9 7 )$ between both platforms and the AxSYM. Results are also presented below comparing 164 endogenous serum patient Vancomycin levels in the IMMULITE 2500 versus the IMMULITE 2000. Results show high correlation (r=0.970) between methods. High correlation indicates equivalence of assays.
