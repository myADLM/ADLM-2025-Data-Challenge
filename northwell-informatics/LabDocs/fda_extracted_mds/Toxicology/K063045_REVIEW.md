# L. Test Principle:

The IMMULITE 2000, IMMULITE 2500 Vancomycin assay is a solid phase competitive chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay. The solid phase (bead) is coated with ligand-labeled vancomycin. The reagent contains alkaline phosphatase (bovine calf intestine) conjugated to monoclonal murine anti-vancomycin. Vancomycin in the patient sample competes with the ligand-labeled solid phase for vancomycin binding sites on the monoclonal murine antivancomycin enzyme conjugate. The excess sample and reagent are removed by a centrifugal wash. Finally, chemiluminescent substrate is added to the bead and signal is generated in proportion to the bound enzyme.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The sponsor performed precision studies based on CLSI document EP5-A2. Two instruments were used on each platform (Immu 2000 and Immu 2500) with three different reagent kit lots on Immulite 2000 and one kit lot on Immulite 2500. Two aliquots of each test sample were assayed in two runs per day over 20 different days (not necessarily consecutive) for a total 80 replicates per test sample per lot. Two controls samples and six precision pools ( human serum spiked with vancomycin with targeted concentrations of 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, $4 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ ) were used. The lowest pool sample consistently read lower than $3 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ and was therefore not included in the analysis. The analysis of variance was used to estimate the within-run and total variance of the Immulite 2000 and 2500 Vancomycin assays. Summary of the results are shown below:

For the IMMULITE 2000, maximum statistics across 3 lots using 2 instruments per lot indicate that intra- and inter-assay $C V \%$ over the range of approximately 5 to $4 7 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ are not greater than $1 0 . 2 \%$ and $6 . 8 \%$ , respectively.

For the IMMULITE 2500, maximum statistics for one kit lot using 2 instruments indicate that intra- and inter-assay $C V \%$ over the range of approximately 5 to $4 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ are not greater than $6 . 1 \%$ and $6 . 0 \%$ , respectively.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A study to evaluate the measuring range was performed on the Immulite 2000 using one kit lot with ten serum patient samples. A serial dilution was performed with each sample and all samples were run in triplicate. The range of the samples was 9 to 46 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . The mean result for each dilution was compared to its calculated expected value and expressed as a percent recovery. Recovery ranged from 93 to $10 5 \%$ . The average $\%$ recovery for these samples tested was $9 6 \%$ .

A recovery study was performed to test the ability of an assay to quantitatively recover added analyte. Six (6) patient samples and one calibrator were spiked with various concentrations of vancomycin on the Immulite 2000 analyzer. Recovery ranged from 93 to $1 1 0 \%$ . The average $\%$ recovery for these spiked samples was $101 \%$ .

In addition, sponsor also performed additional recovery study to confirm the manual dilution of 1:2 can be used when result was greater than $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ (upper reportable range). Four samples with Vancomycin levels of 58.2, 91.9, 90.2, and $8 6 . 9 \ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ were diluted and the mean $\%$ recovery was $90 \%$ . Dilution recovery ranged from 80 to $104 \%$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The Immulite $2 0 0 0 /$ Immulite 2500 Vancomycin assay is traceable to the Chemical Reference Standard (CRS batch 2) certified by the European Pharmcopoeia Commision.

The Vancomycin adjustors, included in the reagent kit, are two levels (low and high) of lyophilized vancomycin in a human serum/buffer matrix. Adjustors are used to correlate the signal counts per second (CPS) of the IMMULITE platform instrument in the user's lab to those of the Master Curve and to account for the changes in reagent enzyme activity and/or operating conditions. In all IMMULITE platform instruments, calibrators are used at the site of manufacture to establish the Master Curve, which is encoded in the kit barcode label. The calibrators are not provided to the customers because the calibration of a specific kit lot is completed at the DPC manufacturing site. Adjustors are used to correlate the signal counts per second (CPS) of the particular IMMULITE instrument in the user's lab to those of the Master Curve and to account for the changes in reagent enzyme activity and/or operating conditions. The quality of the adjustment is monitored by reviewing the slope and the intercept of the adjustment process, not the target values of the adjustors. The acceptance criteria of the slope and the intercept are specified in the Acceptability Criteria section in the specific IMMULITE platform instrument Operator's Manual. Therefore, concentrations of the adjustors are not provided to customers.

Stability of the kit: Stability testing is on-going. Results of the real-time and accelerated stress studies support claim of 360 days shelf life for the Immulite 2000/2500 Vancomycin assay kits when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ . Reagents are stable at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ until expiration date and has an on-board stability of 90 days. Adjustors are stable at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \mathrm { { \sc ~ O } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ for 30 days after reconstitution, or for 6 months (Aliquotted) at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { } ^ { o } C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank:

The determination of Limit of Blank (LoB) was based on the CSLI guidelines EP17-A. The guideline defines LoB as the highest value expected to be seen in a series of results for samples that contain no analyte. 60 replicates of three zero analyte samples were analyzed. The samples used were a zero analyte plasma sample, a zero analyte serum sample, and the assay’s zero calibrator. The procedure was performed for three kit lots on the Immulite 2000 and one kit lot on the Immulite 2500. The LoB was computed parametrically as the mean minus $1 . 6 5 ^ { * } \mathrm { S D }$ . The mean from the multiple instruments, kit lots and samples was calculated. The sponsor claim the $\mathrm { L o B } = 0 . 4 \ : \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$

The Limit of Detection:

The determination of Limit of Detection (LoD) was based on the CSLI guidelines EP17- A. The guideline defines the LoD as the actual concentration at which an observed test result is likely to exceed the LoB and may therefore be declared as detected. 5 samples were tested and analyzed. A series of results (64) for each of the 5 samples were generated in a total of 8 runs on 8 unique days. There were 2 replicates of each sample per run. Two Immulite 2000 and two Immulite 2500 instruments were used in this procedure. The LoD was estimated as $\mathrm { L o B } + 1 . 6 5 ^ { * } \mathrm { S D }$ . The mean result from each instrument for each sample used, for each kit lot was calculated. The sponsor claim the $\mathrm { L o D } = 0 . 9 \ : \mathrm { \underline { { { \mu } } } g / m L }$

The reportable range for the assay is $3 - 5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$

# e. Analytical specificity:

Potential cross-reactants were spiked at concentrations listed in the following table into a neat normal human serum sample and a human serum sample spiked with $2 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ vancomycin. Both neat and spiked aliquots of the samples were analyzed with 2 replicates per sample. The average results were analyzed for percent interference/crossreactivity. This procedure was carried out on one Immulite 2000 instrument using on lot of reagent. Results are presented below for potential cross-reactants tested in the concentration listed:
