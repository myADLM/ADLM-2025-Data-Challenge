VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System

# I. Device Description:

The VITROS THC assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay that is performed using the VITROS THC Reagent with the VITROS Calibrator Kit 30, VITROS FS Calibrator 1 and VITROS FS Diluent Pack 4 (DAT Diluent / DAT Diluent 2) on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems. The VITROS THC Reagent is a dual chambered package containing ready-to-use liquid reagents that are used to detect cannabinoids in urine. Sample, calibrators, and controls are automatically treated with surfactant (DAT Diluent 2) prior to addition of reagents. Treated sample is added to Reagent 1 containing antibodies reactive to delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), glucose-6-phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left( \mathrm { N A D + } \right)$ , followed by Reagent 2 containing delta-9-THC labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH). The assay is based on competition between delta 9-THC metabolites in the treated urine sample and the delta 9 -THC labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH) for antibody binding sites. Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, therefore the concentration of delta-9-THC metabolites in the urine sample is directly proportional to measured enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left( \mathrm { N A D + } \right)$ to NADH, resulting in an absorbance change that is measured spectrophotometrically at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .

VITROS Calibrator Kit 30 is prepared from human urine to which analyte, surfactant, and preservatives have been added. The VITROS FS Calibrator 1 is composed of processed water and $0 . 9 \%$ w/v sodium chloride (Saline). These calibrators are used to calibrate VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems for the qualitative or semiquantitative measurement of cannabinoids (THC).

VITROS DAT Performance Verifiers I, II, III, IV and V are prepared from a human urine pool to which analytes, surfactant, and preservative have been added. These are assayed controls used to monitor performance of the VITROS THC assay on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

# L. Test Principle:

Sample, calibrators, and controls are automatically treated with surfactant (DAT Diluent 2) prior to addition of reagents. Treated sample is added to Reagent 1 containing antibodies reactive to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), glucose-6-phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left( \mathrm { N A D + } \right)$ , followed by Reagent 2 containing delta-9-THC labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH). The assay is based on competition between delta-9-THC metabolites in the treated urine sample and the delta-9 -THC labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH) for antibody binding sites. Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, therefore the concentration of delta9-THC metabolites in the urine sample is directly proportional to measured enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left( \mathrm { N A D + } \right)$ to NADH, resulting in an absorbance change that is measured spectrophotometrically at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The evaluation was conducted on the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System on each of 22 calendar days using three lots of reagents on two different systems. Each run consisted of seven control fluids to challenge system precision at approximately $\pm 2 5 \%$ of the cut-off values (20 and $5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ), at the cut-off values, and at a high THC level $( 7 5 \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ . Control fluids are drug-spiked, pooled human urine with concentrations verified by GC/MS. Four calibrations were performed over the 22-day testing period. Multiple runs within a day were separated by at least two hours. All fluids were run in duplicate in each run. Final results and the calculation of within lab imprecision are based on weekly calibrations.

The results of the test samples were analyzed by ANOVA as detailed in NCCLS EP5-A2. The mean within lab CV of the three lots tested was $3 . 5 \%$ (range $1 . 7 - 9 . 0 \%$ ).

Qualitative precision was estimated by determining the percentage of negative controls that produced a negative result versus the cutoff value and the percentage of positive controls that produced a positive result versus the cutoff value.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cut-offLevel</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cut-off</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>NumberTested</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CorrectResults</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Confidence Level</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20 ng/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.75x</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>262</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>262</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&gt; 95% negative reading</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20 ng/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.25x</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>264</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>263</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&gt; 95% positive reading</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>50 ng/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.75x</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>264</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>264</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&gt; 95% negative reading</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>50 ng/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.25x</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>264</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>264</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&gt; 95% positive reading</td></tr></table>

One result pair (0.75x) $2 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ cutoff was excluded because the wrong fluid was tested.

The results demonstrated acceptable imprecision on the VITROS THC Reagent lots and VITROS 5,1 FS Systems evaluated.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The reportable range of the assay is from 5.0 to $8 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . A linearity study was performed according to NCCLS EP6-A. Urine pools containing low and high concentrations of 11-nor-delta-9-THC-9-COOH were mixed together resulting in 16 samples with 11-nor-delta-9-THC-9-COOH concentrations that spanned the measuring range of the assay. The linearity was evaluated with multiple reagent lots and assessed by comparing the measured VITROS THC assay values against the percent high pool to determine if the data conformed to a straight line. The linear regression calculations gave $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 }$ values of 0.999 and all samples were within the acceptance criteria when measured results

were compared to expected results across the sample range tested (2.5 – 82.5 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } ) }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The values assigned to the VITROS calibrators and controls for 11-nor-delta9-THC-9-COOH are traceable to NIST standard SRM 1507b, verified by GC/MS.

Working Calibrators that are value assigned by a GC/MS method with reference to NIST SRM 1507b are used to assign values to master calibrators using the Vitros 5,1 Chemistry system. These master calibrators are then used to assign values to final product calibrators. Controls are manufactured and verified by GC/MS traceable to NIST SRM 1507b. Final control values are assigned using the Vitros 5,1 Chemistry system. Real time stability studies are used to support both long term and open vial storage dates.

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank (LOB), Limit of Detection (LOD) and Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) were determined following NCCLS EP17-A. The Limit of Blank, Limit of Detection and Limit of Quantitation were calculated for three reagent lots and determined to be $1 . 7 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $4 . 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , and $5 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , respectively. The limit of quantitation is used when determining the reportable range of the assay.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Determination of Cross-reactivity

Cross-reactivity was examined by adding potential cross-reactant compounds into a drug free calibrator. The compounds were evaluated using the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System to determine the VITROS THC Assay value equivalent to that of the calibration 11-nor-delta-9-THC-9-COOH analyte, at the cutoff values of $2 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Screened compounds exceeding the cutoff responses were further diluted with drug free calibrator to determine the approximate compound concentration required to generate a VITROS THC Assay value equivalent to 11-nor-delta-9-THC-9-COOH at the cutoff values.

\*The VITROS THC assay cutoff value $( \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ divided by the amount of crossreactant $\mathrm { ( n g / m L ) }$ that produces a value equivalent to the cutoff value, multiplied by 100.

# Exogenous Compounds

Exogenous compounds were evaluated with a single test fluid spiked with the featured compound at a high concentration level $( 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 { \mathrm { n g / m L } } )$ . These compounds were spiked into commercially available calibrators with THC concentrations of $2 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ or $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Exogenous compounds demonstrating biases that exceeded the acceptance criteria were considered to interfere with the VITROS THC Assay at the cutoff value tested. When interference was observed, on-board dilutions of the test fluid were performed to estimate the highest interferent concentration that did not exceed the acceptance criteria at the cutoff value.

# Endogenous Compounds

Solutions for the evaluation of potential endogenous interferents were prepared by addition of endogenous compounds a commercial calibrator containing THC. The test fluids and their control blanks were run on a VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry. The effects of variations in pH were tested by adjusting the calibrator pH. Endogenous compounds demonstrating biases that exceeded the acceptance criteria were considered to interfere with the VITROS THC Assay for the appropriate cutoff value tested. When interference was observed, on-board dilutions of the test fluid were performed to estimate the highest interferent concentration that did not exceed the acceptance criteria at the cutoff value.
