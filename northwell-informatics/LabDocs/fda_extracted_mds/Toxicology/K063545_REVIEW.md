# 3. Comparison with predicate:

The device is similar or the same as the previously cleared predicate(s) in the following ways: test principles, indication for use, used in a professional and point-of-care setting, read time and sample matrix. The candidate device and the predicates are both visually-read single use devices.

The differences are the addition of oxycodone and changes to the cutoffs for AMP, MET and COC are the cutoffs. The amphetamine cutoff has been lowered from $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ to 300, cocaine was lowered from $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ to 150 $\mathrm { n g / m l }$ , and methamphetamine has been lowered from 500 to $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ .

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced.

# L. Test Principle:

The device employs lateral flow immunochromatographic technology and is based on the principle of competitive binding. Drugs, if present in concentrations below the cutoff level, will not saturate the binding sites of the antibody coated particles on the drug specific test strips. The goat-anti-rabbit IgG antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-specific conjugate. If the level of drug in the urine specimen is below the cutoff concentration, the T line appears as a visible burgundy line. If the level of drug in the urine specimen is above the cutoff, no T line develops. The control line (C line) serves as an internal quality control of certain testing steps. It should always appear as a burgundy-colored band regardless of the presence of the

drug if enough sample volume has been added to the test and if sample has correctly migrated up the test strip.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# 1. Analytical performance:

Analytical performance data (summarized in section M.1) is for the new test strips only: amphetamine $( 3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ ), cocaine ( $\mathrm { 1 5 0 n g / m L ) }$ , methamphetamine (300 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } ) }$ , and oxycodone (100 and $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ). Clinical performance to support OTC use of a subset of analytes is presented in Section M.2 below.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision was assessed by conducting with-in day, between day and between lot precision studies on three lots with six devices on four samples for three days. The four samples were 0, $7 5 \%$ , $12 5 \%$ and 300 or $3 3 3 \%$ of the chosen cutoff for each drug.

The sponsor conducted a bridging study along with their cutoff study for each drug to show that the two formats (dip strip and cassette) are equivalent. The results demonstrated equivalency of the two formats. See cutoff section below for a summary of the data.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable. The assay is intended for qualitative use.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

This device has internal process controls. A colored line appearing in the control region confirms that sufficient sample volume has been applied and that the sample has migrated correctly on the test strip. Users are informed not to interpret the test if a colored line failed to appear in the control region. External controls are not supplied with this device.

The sponsor conducted an accelerated degradation study to assess the shelf life of the tests. The sponsor has a real-time shelf-life study ongoing.

# d. Detection limit:

A cutoff study (summarized below) was conducted at six different concentrations of each new test strip and format. Each concentration was confirmed with GC/MS.

The results support the sponsor’s chosen cutoffs of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ for Amphetamine and methamphetamine, $1 5 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ for cocaine and 100 and 300 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ for oxycodone.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Cross-reactivity for the new test strips was evaluated by spiking various concentrations of similarly structured drug compounds into a drug-free urine negative control. When a positive result was obtained, the sample was diluted to half of the concentration and tested again. The sponsor determined the concentration of the drug that produced a response approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentrations of the assays. The cross-reactivity testing results are listed below.

The sponsor evaluated urine $\mathsf { p H }$ for test interference in seven pooled negative urine specimens. The specimens were adjusted to $\mathsf { p H }$ ranging from 3 to 9 and divided into two groups with concentrations of $50 \%$ below and above the cutoff. The testing results are summarized in the table below and the results were the same for all the drugs. The results showed that there was no interference from urine $\mathsf { p H }$ ranging from 3 to 9 and that the device formats (dip strip and cassettes) gave the same result. Both cassette and dip-strip format were tested in duplicate.

The sponsor evaluated specific gravity for test interference in seven pooled negative urine specimens. The specimens were adjusted to specific gravities ranging from 1.002 to 1.035 and divided into two groups with concentrations of $50 \%$ below and above the cutoff. The testing results are summarized in the table below and the results were the same for all the drugs. The results showed that there was no interference from specific gravity ranging from 1.002 to 1.035 and that the device formats (dip strip and cassettes) gave the same result.

The sponsor conducted a sample volume test for the both the cassette and the dipstrip test formats. The study showed that 3 to 5 drops of specimen are required for the cassette test and that the dip-strip devices should be dipped for at least 10 seconds to allow for proper absorption. The sponsor has recommended 4 drops in the package insert.

The sponsor also conducted a reading time test and the study revealed that both devices can obtain results from 4 to 7 minutes after adding the specimen. The sponsor has recommended reading the test after 4 minutes and before 7 minutes.

f. Assay cut-off: Characterization of how the devices perform analytically around the claimed cutoff concentrations appears in the precision above.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The Instant-View Methamphetamine, Amphetamine, Cocaine and Oxycodone cassette kits and test strips were compared to the GC/MS reference method. Amphetamine $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 9 8 )$ , cocaine $\mathrm { ( n { = } 1 0 8 ) }$ ), methamphetamine $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n = 1 } 2 7 )$ ) and oxycodone 100 and $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ $\scriptstyle \mathtt { n } = 8 4$ and 115 respectively for each level) were obtained from a clinical urine sample provider. The results of the method comparison are shown in the tables below.

The sponsor also conducted lay user studies at five separate sites for the OTC version of the multi-drug urine cup and cassette formats. The panel format was evaluated in two separate studies at five sites ( 123 cassette participants and 63 cup participants) lay-users between the ages of 10 to 80 with varying education levels and a trained professional were used. All participants had proper informed consent.

Study 1- Twenty-eight urine samples were prepared by spiking drug-free pooled urine with the drugs to specific concentrations. The concentrations of all the drugs were confirmed by GC/MS except for TCA, which was confirmed by HPLC. Each sample was divided into nine containers and blind-labeled $\mathrm { ( n { = } 2 5 2 }$ ). The samples were further split into two, one for the panel test and the other for the cup. Twenty-one lay-users at three sites were given a set of four samples $( \mathrm { n } { = } 2 5 2 )$ from 84 GC/MS confirmed blind-labeled samples, four complete devices (with all 12 test strips) and one package insert. The lay users tested 4 samples (panel or cup) and read all 48 results. The

Study 2- Eleven urine samples were prepared by spiking drug-free pooled urine specimens with the drugs to specific concentrations. The concentrations of all the drugs were confirmed by GC/MS except for TCA, which was confirmed by HPLC. Each sample was divided into sixty containers and blind-labeled $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n } = 6 6 0$ ). Twenty lay users at three sites were given two sets (panel A and panel B) of blind-labeled samples, devices and a package insert. Panel A is comprised of AMP100, BAR, BZD300, COC300, MET1000, MOR2000, AMP300, MET300, MOR3200, MTD, PCP and THC. Panel B is comprised of AMP500, BZD200, COC150, MET500, OXY100, BUP, KET, OXY300, PPX, TCA and XTC. Panel A samples included samples 1 to 6 and panel B samples include samples 7 to 11.
