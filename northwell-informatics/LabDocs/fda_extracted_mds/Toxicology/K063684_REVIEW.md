# L. Test Principle:

The Cobas lithium is a colorimetric test in which lithium present in a sample reacts with a substituted porphyrin compound at an alkaline pH, resulting in a change in absorbance which is directly proportional to the concentration of lithium in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Imprecision was evaluated for 21 days by testing two serum samples and two controls in triplicates on the Cobas c501 analyzer on a single lot at the manufacturer’s site. Within-run precision was evaluated by testing two serum samples and two controls in replicates of 21 on the Cobas c501 analyzer on a single lot. The results are shown in the table below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The sponsor conducted two recovery studies to encompass the following ranges- 0.01 to $1 . 0 3 \mathrm { m M o l } / 1$ and 0.00 to $3 . 3 7 \mathrm { m M o l } / 1 .$ . The dilution series (11 samples) were prepared from spiked lithium chloride serum samples and the recovered values were compared to the theoretical values based on known dilutions. The deviations from expected recovery for the assay ranged from 90.9 to $1 0 4 . 4 \%$ .

The sponsor validated the upper auto-dilution range via a recovery study using automated dilution rerun 5 samples ranging from 3.51 to $5 . 6 6 \mathrm { m M o l } / 1$ . The control material was run in duplicate and the percent recovery ranged from $9 9 \%$ to $104 \%$ .

The combined results supports the sponsor’s claimed measuring range of 0.05 mMol/l to $3 . 0 0 \ \mathrm { \ m M o l / l }$ (up to $6 . 0 0 \mathrm { m M o l / l }$ with autodilution).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The sponsor conducted shelf-life and on-board reagent stability studies and the results supports the sponsor’s shelf life stability claim of 12 months and an on-board stability claim of 4 weeks.

The sponsor also conducted a shelf-life stability study on the C.f.a.s.   
calibrators. The results support the calibrators 24 month stability claim.

The C.f.a.s. lithium values are traceable to SEM 956b, a serum-based lithium standard reference material.

# d. Detection limit:

The sponsor conducted a limit of blank (LoB) study according CLSI EP 17-A. Five human sera samples free of analyte were measured in duplicate in six separate runs for a total of 60 values. The sponsor reports a LoB of 0.02 mMol/L.

The sponsor conducted as limit of detection (LoD) study according to guidelines CLSI EP 17-A. The LoD was determined as the lowest amount of analyte in a sample that can be detected with $9 5 \%$ probability. Five samples with low lithium concentrations between 0.1 and $0 . 5 \mathrm { m M o l / L }$ were measured in duplicate in six separate runs for a total of 60 values. The precision (SD) was calculated for each sample. A pooled estimate of precision over the five samples was then determined (SDtotal) and the LOD was calculated as $_ { \mathrm { L o D = L o B + 1 . 6 5 3 ~ x } }$ SDtotal. The sponsor reports a LoD of $0 . 0 5 \mathrm { m M o l / L }$ .

Precision at the lower assay range was determined by evaluating ten samples with concentrations ranging from 0 and $0 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m M o l / L }$ , twice a day over 5 days on the Cobas c01 analyzer. The mean, standard deviation and the CV were calculated for each concentration and the CVs were plotted against the mean concentration. Based on this evaluation and the linearity evaluation, the lowest concentration where the CV yielded $20 \%$ or less was $0 . 0 9 \mathrm { m M o l / L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Endogenous interferents were tested using pooled human plasma and serum samples spiked with varying levels of interferent. The samples were tested in triplicates and the median values were used to calculate recovery. Five different human serum/plasma pools containing $0 . 8 2 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 1 . 1 0 \mathrm { m M o l / L }$ lithium were tested for hemoglobin, bilirubin and intralipid interference. Ten levels of hemoglobin were tested up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Eleven levels of conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin were tested up to $6 1 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Ten levels of intralipid were tested up to $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The sponsor defined interference as recovery greater than $+ / - 1 0 \%$ of initial values at therapeutic concentrations. There was no interference detected up to the concentrations noted above.

Eighteen commonly used pharmaceuticals were tested for interference with the lithium test system. Two serum pools with two lithium concentrations (0.91 and $1 . 4 8 \mathrm { m M o l / L }$ ) were tested. Varying concentrations of interferent were added and samples were analyzed in triplicate. The sponsor defined interference as recovery greater than $+ / - 5 \%$ of initial values at therapeutic concentrations. No interference was detected at the concentrations tested. The following drugs were tested:

Eight potentially interfering cations were studied for interference with the lithium test system (0.91 and $0 . 9 4 ~ \mathrm { m M o l / L } )$ ). The interfering compounds were weighed in gravimetrically and no interference was observed for any of the compounds up to the concentrations listed below.

# b. Matrix comparison:

The sponsor conducted most of the studies for this submission on serum samples. To validate the use of additional sample types (sodium heparin and potassium EDTA plasma and serum separator tubes (SST)) parallel samples were collected in serum, SST, Na-Heparin plasma and $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA plasma tubes. Samples were collected from 20 different donors. Lithium was spiked to all tubes resulting in a lithium concentrations ranging from 0.6 to 1.75 mMol/L. Two anticoagulant concentrations were assessed for each type of anticoagulant with serum clot activator tube as the reference. Each sample was split and 20 were filled completely and 20 were half-filled resulting in twice the expected anticoagulant concentration. Plasma results were compared to the serum results and percent recovery was determined. The percentage deviations from expected recovery for the assay ranged from 95.5 to 102.6 for SST, 95.5 to 102.9 for filled sodium heparin, 95.0 to 104.4 for half-filled sodium heparin, 94.3 to 105.6 for the filled K2-EDTA and 94.4 to 105.6 for half-filled K2-EDTA. The results support the usage of SST, sodium heparin and potassium EDTA with the device.
