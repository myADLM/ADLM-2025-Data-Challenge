# L. Test Principle:

Electrolyte measurements in the T60 analyzer are made with ion selective electrodes (ISE) directly without any dilution of the sample. The measurement cell consists of several ion selective electrodes and one reference electrode. The measured potential between each ISE and the common reference electrode is in the simplest case related to the natural logarithm of the ionic activity according to the Nernst equation. The changes in potential are developed across the ISE membrane/sample interface. Selectivity coefficients toward other ions must be known in the determination of lithium, as the lithium electrode is also sensitive to sodium. This is taken into account in the Nikolsky equation.

The theophylline assay uses recombinant DNA technology to produce a unique homogeneous enzyme immunoassay system. The assay is based on the bacterial enzyme $\beta$ -galactosidase, which has been genetically engineered into two inactive fragments. These fragments spontaneously reassociate to form fully active enzyme that, in the assay format, cleaves a substrate, generating a color change that can be measured spectrophotometrically. In the assay, analyte in the sample competes with analyte conjugated to one inactive fragment of $\beta$ -galactosidase for antibody binding site. If analyte is present in the sample, it binds to antibody, leaving the inactive enzyme fragments free to form active enzyme. If analyte is not present in the sample, antibody binds to analyte conjugated on the inactive fragment, inhibiting the reassociation of inactive $\beta$ -galactosidase fragments, and no active enzyme is formed. The amount of active enzyme formed and resultant absorbance change are directly proportional to the amount of drug present in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Lithium: To evaluate precision, the within-run and between-run repeatability of the Lithium assay was calculated using CLSI EP5-A2 as a guideline. Two commercially marketed serum controls were measured on two runs per day, two replicates per run, over 21 days (low control sample) or 22 days (high control) using three T60 analyzers, three electrodes and two operators.

Theophylline: The within-run and between-run repeatability as well as total precision of the Theophylline assay was calculated using CLSI EP5-A2 as a guideline. Three commercially marketed controls (sub-therapeutic, therapeutic and toxic levels) were tested over 21 days, two runs per day, two replicates per run, two reagent lots, by three operators, on three different instruments.

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Lithium: The claimed measuring range is $0 . 2 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 4 . 0 \mathrm { m m o l } / 1$ . Linearity across the range was evaluated with a dilution series using normal level human serum spiked with lithium chloride with values spanning the measuring range. Four parallel measurements were made in random order. The assay recovered $+ / - 0 . 1 5 \mathrm { m m o l } / 1$ or $+ / - 1 0 \%$ from expected values.

Theophylline: The claimed measuring range is $1 . 4 - 4 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m l }$ . Linearity across the range was evaluated with two studies. The first study used the low and high calibrator (TDM Calibrator B0 and B1) to create a series of 11 samples that ranged from $0 . 2 8 3 - 4 4 . 8 \mu \mathrm { g / m l }$ . The second dilution series used low patient serum spiked with TDM Calibrator B1 and samples ranged from $1 . 0 - 4 9 \mu \mathrm { g / m l }$ . Four parallel measurements were made in random order for both dilution series. Both series showed recovery within $+ / - 1 0 \%$ from expected values.

It is recommended in the labeling that samples with theophylline values above $4 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m l }$ are diluted 1:1 with the TDM Calibrator 0 before re-testing. This recommendation was tested by preparing 1-to-1 dilutions with TDM Calibrator B0 as well as drug free serum and comparing recovery with the expected value. The high samples were prepared by spiking separate low level human serum samples with TDM Calibrator B1. The spiked serum samples were then diluted 1- to-1 both with drug free serum and with TDM calibrator B0. The four replicates of the diluted samples were analyzed on the T60 analyzer. Dilution of high sample with TDM Calibrator B0 showed efficient recovery of all samples tested.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): ISE Calibrator 1 and 2&3: The ISE Calibrators are prepared gravimetrically using purity grade chemicals and purified laboratory water. The levels of the calibrators are verified by comparison to the in-house reference lot, which is traceable to the primary NIST standard SMR 924 using the reference

measurement procedure, in this case NBR 260-69. The most recent traceability testing was performed by DGKL (Reference Institute of the German Society of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Germany). To test the normal production lots of a new ISE Calibrators the ion-selective electrode-based electrolyte analyzer is calibrated with the manufacturer’s ISE Standards. Control sera are used to verify the calibration and electrode functionality. The ISE Calibrator lots to be checked are then measured alongside the existing ISE Standards five times each interspersed with the serum controls to check the consistency of the calibration.

Shelf life $( 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and on-board stability testing protocols and the acceptance criteria for stability testing were described and found to be acceptable.

TDM Calibrator Set B: The primary standard is prepared gravimetrically from mixing USP Theophylline reference material into drug-free human serum. Value assignment of new lots of primary standards (high and low) is verified through validation studies using the previous set of primary standards. Commercial product calibrators are made with Theophylline in an artificial matrix. The commercial calibrators are assigned values based on the current set of primary calibrators (1 vial $\textbf { \scriptsize x } 1 0$ determinations each, 3 runs).

Shelf life $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and open vial (60 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) stability testing protocols and the acceptance criteria for stability testing were described and found to be acceptable.

# d. Detection limit:

Theophylline: Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined with 24 replicates of TDM Calibrator B0 solution. The LoB was defined as the concentration corresponding to three standard deviations above the average concentration, and calculated to be $0 . 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined to be $1 . 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

The low detection limit of the Lithium ISE electrode (0.2 mmol/L) was validated in the linearity study described above.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies: An evaluation of potential assay interferences was performed to assess the performance of the Lithium and Theophylline assays when potential contaminants are present in a sample. Testing was done according to CLSI EP7-A2. Non-interference was defined as deviations less than or equal to $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the initial value.

Lithium: No interference was found with bilirubin (total) up to $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ hemolysis up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ or lipemia up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ .

The following substances were screened at (or above) the CLSI document EP7-A or Laboratory Handbook1 suggested screening concentrations in three levels of $\mathrm { L i } ^ { + } ( 0 . 5 , 1 . 2 , 2 . 0 \mathrm { m M } )$ . The $\mathrm { L i ^ { + } }$ concentrations in the patient sera (Scipac) were spiked from a $0 . 5 { \bf M }$ stock LiCl solution.

Samples containing the interferant were compared against blank samples. If the results varied by more than $5 \%$ or by more than $0 . 0 5 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ , the substance was considered to interfere with the $\mathrm { L i } ^ { + }$ test. Of these 20 species, only methyl paraben was a significant interferant towards the $\mathrm { T 6 0 i \ L i ^ { + } }$ ISE measurement, and caused a decrease in the measured $\mathrm { L i } ^ { + }$ concentration. A series of 5 concentrations was then run for the $\mathrm { L i } ^ { + }$ method with methyl paraben as the interferant to determine what concentration of methyl paraben does not interfere significantly, and it was determined that methyl paraben levels as low as $3 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ can cause a $5 \%$ decrease in the measured $\mathrm { L i } ^ { + }$ .

Theophylline: No interference was found for bilirubin (total) up to 58.5 $\mathrm { m g / d l }$ , hemolysis up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ or lipemia up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ . Acetaminophen, ephedrine, and epinephrine were also screened for potential interference. No interference was found for Acetaminophen up to $5 2 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m l } }$ , Ephedrine up to $2 5 ~ \mathrm { \mu g / m l }$ , and Epinephrine up to $2 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m l }$ . Additional compounds were tested for cross-reactivity (see product insert). Cross-reactivity with 1,3-Dimethyluric acid was seen and a note in the assay labeling indicates that uremic patients should not be evaluated with this assay.
