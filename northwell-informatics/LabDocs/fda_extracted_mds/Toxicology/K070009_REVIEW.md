# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): Refer to the Indications for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use: The Phamatech At Home 12 Drug Test: Models 9308T and 9308Z for amphetamines (AMP), barbiturates (BAR), benzodiazepines (BZD), cocaine (COC), ecstasy (MDMA), methadone (MTD), methamphetamine (MET), opiates (OPI), oxycodone (OXY), phencyclidine (PCP) and marijuana (THC) is a screening test for the rapid detection of the drugs listed above in urine. The cutoff concentrations $\left( \mathrm { n g / m l } \right)$ for these drugs are as follows: amphetamines (1000), barbiturates (200), benzodiazepines (200), cocaine (300), ecstasy (500), methadone (300), methamphetamine (500), opiates (300), oxycodone (100), phencyclidine (25) and marijuana (50).

The BAR, BZD and OXY assay will yield preliminary positive results when these drugs are ingested at or above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly recognized drug levels for barbiturates, benzodiazepines or oxycodone in urine.

This test only identifies the presence of these drugs when present at or above the stated cut-off concentration.

This assay provides only a preliminary test result. A more specific alternate analytical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography / Mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory test method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.

This device is not for professional or workplace testing. It is intended for Home Use.

This device is intended for over-the-counter (OTC) consumer use as the first step in a two step process to provide consumers with information concerning the presence or absence of the above stated drugs / drug metabolites in urine. Information regarding confirmation testing – the second step in the process, along with materials for shipping urine samples to the laboratory, are included.

# I. Device Description:

The At Home Drug Test 12 Model 9308Z is a single use device utilizing a cup format. The user collects urine in the cup to the recommended volume and fills the labeled vial to two-thirds full. The reaction is initiated by movement of the sample through the test strip. Test strips are incorporated into the sides of a sample cup. The kit includes the following materials: 1 instructional booklet, 1 urine collection cup, 1 labeled vial, 1 plastic pouch with absorbent pad, 1 pre-addressed mailer box and 1 personal identification label.

The At Home Drug Test 12 Model 9308T is a single use dip card device. The user inserts the absorbent end of the device in the urine sample to the maximum level indicated by the line on the device label. The test reaction is initiated by movement of the sample through the test strip. The kit includes the following materials: 1 instructional booklet, 1 urine collection cup, 1 labeled vial, 1 plastic pouch with absorbent pad, 1 pre-addressed mailer box and 1 personal identification label.

The At Home Drug Test 12 devices detect up to twelve drugs of abuse. The table presented below lists the drugs of abuse that were previously cleared for OTC use, the 510(k) number they were cleared under and the device format (card or cup).

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced.

# L. Test Principle:

The tests employ lateral flow immunochromatographic technology, which involves the recognition and formation of a specific antibody/target drug complex. Drug in the sample and drug-labeled conjugate compete for antibody binding sites. Absence of a line in the test area is a presumptive positive result, and the presence of a line in the test area is a negative result. The control line (C) serves as an internal quality control to ensure proper sample volume has been added to the test and that the sample has correctly migrated up the test strip.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: See Clinical Studies section 3c. below for performance data around the cutoffs.   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable.   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): This device has internal process controls. A colored line appearing in the

control region confirms that sufficient sample volume has been applied and that the sample has migrated correctly on the test strip. Users are informed not to interpret the test if a colored line failed to appear in the control region. External controls are not supplied with this device.

# Study #1

109 consumers performed the tests using high clinical samples diluted in normal drug-free urine. Some samples contained as many as ten drugs; there were combinations that contained no drugs at all. Drug concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS. Consumers tested even numbered samples on the test cup device and odd numbered samples on the test card device. Each of the new drugs intended for OTC use, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, methadone and oxycodone, were tested at $0 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $7 5 \%$ , $12 5 \%$ , and $1 5 0 \%$ of the target concentration. The drugs previously cleared for OTC use, amphetamines, cocaine, methamphetamines, opiates, PCP, and THC were tested at various cutoff concentrations ranging from $0 \%$ to $1 5 0 \%$ of the target concentrations.

1,073 of 1,081 interpretations made by lay users were correct $( 9 9 \% )$ . At $7 5 \%$ of the cutoff, 99 of the 100 test interpretations were scored as correct. There was one false positive for amphetamines. At $\leq 5 0 \%$ of the cutoff, 884 of the 891 test interpretations were scored as correct. There was 1 false positive for benzodiazepine and THC, 2 false positives for opiates and 3 false positives for PCP.

# Study #2

760 unique tests with sample solutions containing amphetamines, methamphetamines, cocaine, benzodiazepine, barbiturates, oxycodone, methadone, opiates, THC and PCP were performed by 38 consumers using drug-free urine that had been spiked with various concentrations and combinations of drugs. Participants tested random coded samples with various combinations of drugs at $7 5 \%$ , $12 5 \%$ and $1 5 0 \%$ of the target concentrations. Drug concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS. Consumers performed the assays using the test card format.

750 of 760 interpretations $( 9 8 \% )$ made by lay users were correct. At $7 5 \%$ of cut-off, 229 of 235 interpretations were scored as correct results. There were 6 false positives for oxycodone; 1 false positive for benzodiazepines and 1 false positive for cocaine. At $12 5 \%$ of cut-off 268 of 270 interpretations were scored as correct results. There were 2 Invalid test results; i.e., control and/or test line did not develop. At $1 5 0 \%$ of cut-off 253 of 255 interpretations were scored as correct results. There was 1 false negative for PCP and 1 false negative for THC.

# Study #3

Sample solutions containing oxycodone were performed by thirty-three consumers at two Phamatech locations. Thirty of the samples were clinical samples diluted in drug-free urine to an approximate concentration of 67 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Three positive samples were Oxycodone $2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ control diluted to an approximate concentration of $1 0 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Of the total thirty-three

interpretations made by lay users a total of 33 test results were correct.   
Consumers performed the assays using the test card format.

A total of 1,874 tests were interpreted by lay users and 1,844 tests were interpreted correctly. The sponsor pooled the results obtained by the test cup and test card formats because these formats were demonstrated to be equivalent in $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } ) \mathrm { s }$ previously cleared for these analytes. The summary of the results for Studies 1, 2 and 3 is presented in the tables below:
