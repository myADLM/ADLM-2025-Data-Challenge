Phamatech QuickScreen™ Barbiturates Test Models 9019, 9018

The QuickScreen Barbiturates Test is a qualitative in-vitro diagnostic screen that provides a preliminary result for the detection/presence of barbiturates in urine. Tests for barbiturates cannot distinguish between abused drugs and certain prescribed medications. The cut-off concentration will be $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ (secobarbital). It is intended for professional use only.

Phamatech QuickScreen™ Pro Multi Drug Screening Test Model 9317T

QuickScreen™ Pro Multi Drug Screening Test is an in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of amphetamine, cocaine, methamphetamine, opiates, PCP, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, methadone and THC in urine. Tests for prescription drugs cannot distinguish between abused drugs and certain prescribed medications. Measurements obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis and treatment of drug abuse. It is intended for professional use only.

Phamatech QuickScreen™ Pro Drug Cup Model 9187Z

QuickScreen™ Pro Drug Cup is an in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of amphetamine, cocaine, methamphetamine, opiates, PCP, Barbiturates, benzodiazepines, methadone and THC in urine. Tests for prescription drugs cannot distinguish between abused drugs and certain prescribed medications. Measurements obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis and treatment of drug abuse.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

This test provides only a preliminary test result. A more specific alternate testing method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Other confirmation methods are available. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are observed.

4. Special instrument requirements:

Not applicable.

# I. Device Description:

The single barbiturate test and multi drug test device employs lateral flow immunochromatographic technology and is based on the principle of competitive binding. The device is available in the cassette, dipstick and cup formats. Drugs, if present in concentrations below the cutoff level, will not saturate the binding sites of the antibody coated particles on the drug specific test strips. The goat-anti-rabbit IgG antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-specific conjugate. If the level of drug in the urine specimen is below the cutoff concentration, the T line appears as a visible burgundy line. If the level of drug in the urine specimen is above the cutoff, no T line develops. The control line (C line) serves as an internal quality control of the system. It should always appear as a burgundy-colored band regardless of the presence of the drug.

# L. Test Principle:

The QuickScreen TM Barbiturate tests are chromatographic absorbent devices in which drug metabolites in a sample compete with drug conjugate, immobilized on a porous support membrane, for a limited number of goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody binding sites. When a urine sample is applied to a test device, the barbiturates, if present in the test sample at a concentration of less than $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , will not block the binding sites of the immobilized antigen conjugate in the test region. The dye conjugate will migrate to the test region with the urine. There the dye conjugate will bind to barbiturate derivative immobilized in the test region of the membrane. As a result, a visible rose pink band will form in the test region, indicating a negative

result. Conversely, where barbiturate concentrations are $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ or more the antibody - dye conjugate binds to free drug forming a complex that competes with the immobilized antigen conjugate in the test region. This prevents the development of a rose pink band, indicating a positive sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Eight normal urine pools were spiked with secobarbital to concentrations of 0, 122, 162, 274, 300, 400, 490 and $8 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ and confirmed by GC/MS. One replicate per level was assayed five times per day for 10 days with the cassette format. The results are shown in the table below.

The sponsor conducted a bridging study to assess the equivalency of the 4 format types (dipstick, cassette and dip-card and cup). Fifty GC/MS confirmed urine samples that ranged from 50 to $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ were obtained from clinical sites and were tested in duplicates. The sponsor’s results showed $100 \%$ agreement between formats.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable. This assay in intended for qualitative use.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): This device has an internal process control. A line appearing in the control region confirms that sufficient sample volume has been applied and

that the sample has migrated correctly on the test strip. Users are informed not to interpret the test if a line does not form in the control region. External controls are not supplied with this device but the manufacturer recommends the use of external controls in the labeling.

d. Detection limit:

See assay cutoff section below.

# e. Analytical specificity:

To test the consistency of the test line and control line development, the sponsor tested four urine control pools and five patient samples. The pools and samples were analyzed in replicates of three using three lots of the QuickScreen Barbiturate 300 dipstick test. The results indicate that the development times were under the ten minutes given in the package insert.

The sponsor conducted a prozone study to test the effects of high barbiturate concentrations on the device. A GC/MS confirmed positive urine sample $( > 3 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ was tested with three lots of the QuickScreen Barbiturate 300 test. The sponsor reported no interference with high barbiturate concentrations.

The sponsor conducted a prozone effect (hook-effect) study to evaluate the devices ability to detect high barbiturate concentrations. A GC/MS confirmed positive for barbiturate (concentration greater than $3 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / m L } )$ was tested in three lots of the QuickScreen™ Test. All results for the barbiturates were positive and sponsor reports that there was no prozone effect observed.

The sponsor conducted a $\mathsf { p H }$ study to test for $\mathsf { p H }$ effects on the device. Three urine samples were aliquoted at barbiturate concentrations of 0, 835, and 3000 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Each sample was then again aliquoted into five individual samples and each was adjusted to $\mathsf { p H } 4 . 5$ to 8.5 (increments of $1 \ \mathrm { p H } ,$ ). The sponsor reports no adverse effect with varying pH levels.

The sponsor conducted a test strip flexibility study to determine the dip time for the strip test. Five urine samples were selected at random for this study. The samples had barbiturate concentrations of 0, 0, 449, 531 and $1 1 4 6 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . The sample dip times were varied from 10 seconds to 600 seconds (10 minutes). The samples were run in three assays in triplicates. The samples produced $100 \%$ of the expected results.

The sponsor studied structurally related compounds to test for cross-reactivity in the QuickScreen Barbiturates 300 test. The compounds were prepared in normal human urine and the results (below) were expressed as the amount of compound capable of giving a result equivalent to $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ secobarbital.
