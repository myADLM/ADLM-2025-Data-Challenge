# G. Predicate Device:

The Dimension Vista $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ETOH Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge is substantially equivalent to the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ ALC Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge (K904302) and to the Syva $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Emit $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ II Plus Ethyl Alcohol Assay (K010960).

# H. Device Description:

The Dimension Vista $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ETOH Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge is a prepackaged in-vitro diagnostic test method that is specifically designed to be used on the Dade Behring Dimension Vista $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ E System. The reagents contained in the Dimension Vista $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ ETOH Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge are: Reagent 1 which contains the buffering system and; Reagent 2 which contains alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), buffer, preservatives, and stabilizers.

# G. Intended Use:

The ETOH method is an in-vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of ethyl alcohol in human serum, plasma and urine. Ethyl alcohol test results may be used in the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol intoxication and poisoning.

# I. Substantial Equivalence Information:

The Dimension Vista $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ETOH Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge and the predicates, Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ALC Flex $@$ reagent cartridge and Syva $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Emit $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ II Plus Ethyl Alcohol Assay, were compared. A comparison of the important similarities and differences between the device and the predicates is provided in the following table:

Dear Mr. Carrio:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address at
