# Device Description

NIOX MINO Airway Inflammation Monitor is a hand held device intended to measure fractional exhaled nitric oxide in human breath in ppb levels (parts per billion), complying with 21 CFR 862.3080.

NIOX MINO Airway Inflammation Monitor is manufactured by Aerocrine AB, Sweden. For NIOX MINO Airway Inflammation Monitor, Aerocrine AB claims substantial equivalence to the predicate device $\mathrm { N I O X } ^ { \mathfrak { R } }$ Nitric Oxide Monitoring System (K021 133).

# Figure 1 NIOX MINO® Airway Inflammation Monitor

The intended use for NIOX MINO Airway Inflammation Monitor is the same as the intended use for NIOX, Nitric Oxide Monitoring System. The performance characteristics for NIOX MINO Airway Inflammation Monitor and NIOX Nitric Oxide Monitoring System are substantially equivalent as shown in laboratory and clinical tests.

# Intended use

NIOX $\mathsf { M N O } ^ { \otimes \bar { } }$ measures Nitric Oxide (NO) in human breath. Nitric Oxide is frequently increased in some inflammatory processes such as asthma. The fractional NO concentration in expired breath $( \mathrm { F E _ { N O } } )$ , can be measured by NIOX ${ \bf M N O } ^ { \infty }$ according to guidelines for NO measurement established by the American Thoracic Society.

Measurement of $\mathrm { F E } _ { \mathrm { N O } }$ by NIOX MINO is a quantitative, non-invasive, simple and safe method to measure the decrease in $\mathrm { F E } _ { \mathsf { N O } }$ concentration in asthma patients that often occurs after treatment with anti-inflammatory pharmacological therapy, as an indication of the therapeutic effect in patients with elevated $\mathrm { F E _ { N O } }$ levels. NIOX $\mathrm { { \bf M N O } } ^ { \mathrm { { \sc ~ \alpha } } }$ is suitable for children, approximately 7 - 17 years, and adults 18 years and older.

$\mathrm { F E } _ { \mathsf { N O } }$ measurements provide the physician with means of evaluating an asthma patient's response to anti-inflammatory therapy, as an adjunct to the established clinical and laboratory assessments in asthma. NIOX MINO® should only be used as directed in the NIOX MINO User Manual and the NIOX MINO Quality Control Test User Manual, by trained physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists or laboratory technicians. NIOX MINO® cannot be used with infants or by children approximately under the age of 7, as measurement requires patient cooperation. NIOX MINO should not be used in critical care, emergency care or in anaesthesiology.

# Non-clinical studies performed

Extensive performance testing has been performed to support substantial equivalence. Linearity, precision and accuracy has been evaluated according to laboratory standard NCCLS EP9-P The variation between individual instruments during long-time use under various climate conditions has been studied.

The results from the performance testing support substantial equivalence between NIOX MINO and NIOX.

# Clinical studies performed

Multi-center clinical studies have been performed to validate the intended use and verify substantial equivalence to the predicate device.

Clinical studies demonstrated that NIOX MINO is a quantitative, non-invasive, simple and safe method to measure the decrease in $\mathrm { F E } _ { \mathrm { N O } }$ concentration in asthma patients that often occurs after treatment with antiinflammatory pharmacological therapy, as an indication of the therapeutic effect in patients with elevated $\mathrm { F E } _ { \mathrm { N O } }$ levels. NIOX MINO has been shown to be suitable for children, 7 - 17 years, and adults 18 years and older.

The normal range for nitric oxide in exhaled breath, exhalation flow rates, length of exhalation, differences in levels due to gender, size, and ethnicity and other such aspects are being continuously discussed, forvalues and statistical details, kindlyconsult the official Product Labelling.

It has been demonstrated that only one measurement is sufficient in NIOX MINO to obtain reliable results. For details, kindly consult the Users Manual.

Dear Mr. Slomoff:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490.
