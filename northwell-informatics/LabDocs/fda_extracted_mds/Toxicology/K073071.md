# NAME OF DEVICE

Trade Name: eQ-PCRTM LC Warfarin Genotyping kit Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.3360 Classification Name: Drug melabolizing enzyme genotyping system

PREDICATE DEVICE Verigene $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Warfarin Metabolism Nucleic Acid Test (K070804)

# INTENDED USE

The eQ-PCRTM LC Warfarin Genotyping kit is an in vitro diagnostic test for the detection and genotyping of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the cytochrome P450 enzyme gene CYP2C9 known as $\mathrm { C Y P 2 C 9 ^ { * } } 2$ (C430T) and $\mathrm { C Y P 2 C 9 ^ { * } } 3$ (A1075C), and a SNP in the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 gene VKORC1, known as VKORC1 $- 1 6 3 9 \mathrm { G } \mathrm { > A } )$ obtained from human peripheral blood samples. The eQ-PCR LC Warfarin Genotyping kit is a qualitative assay for use in clinical laboratories upon prescription by the attending physician.

The eQ-PCRTM LC Warfarin Genotyping kit is indicated for use as an aid in identifying patients who may be at risk of warfarin sensitivity.

# PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The eQ-PCR'M LC Warfarin Genotyping Kit assay requires extracted DNA obtained by using any commercially available DNA extraction kit. The extracted DNA sample, within a range of 50-200ng of total DNA, is mixed with a PCR Mix, and an eQ-PCRTM specific Probe Mix reagent containing specific primers and fluorescent labeled probes for the CYP2C9 and/or VKORC1 gene polymorphisms. Amplification and detection are then performed in the Roche Diagnostics LightCycler $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Real-Time PCR System instrument model 1.2 using conditions defined in the specific eQ-PCR™M LC Warfarin Genotyping Kit Product Insert. After the PCR reaction is completed, the Roche Diagnostics LightCycler $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Real-Time PCR System instrument automatically proceeds to the melting curve-based detection method. This real time PCR test is a closed test system and does not require post PCR operations. It reduces human errors and eliminates post-PCR handling contamination.

The instrument's standard melting curve analysis software algorithm of peak patterns and melting temperatures (Tm) determine the genotype (wild type, mutant, heterozygous) for each of the three specified polymorphisms.

Clinical Performance

A clinical trial was conducted to test the performance of the eQ-PCR'M LC Warfarin Genotyping Kit compared to bi-directional sequencing using extracted nucleic acid from whole blood from 159 donors. Two EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood samples were collected from each of 159 adult volunteers. The samples were collected under IRB approval and with Informed Consent. The whole blood samples were extracted at a reference laboratory. The extracted DNA from the two samples from the same matrix per donor was pooled for testing in the study. Bi-directional sequencing was performed at a reference laboratory on the 159 DNA samples extracted from the whole blood samples.

Aliquots of the extracted nucleic acid samples were prepared at TrimGen at a concentration of $1 0 \mathrm { n g / \mu L }$ . Each testing site received aliquots of 50 whole blood (WB) DNA, and 9 commercial control DNA samples. The donor samples tested at each site were unique to that site and did not duplicate the donors at the other two sites. Ten (10) WB samples were tested with the eQ-PCRTM LC Warfarin Genotyping Kit and the Roche LightCycler each day for a total of 5 testing days.

The results for the whole blood testing are summarized below.

The initial results showed overall $9 9 . 6 \%$ clinical sensitivity of the $\mathsf { e Q - P C R } ^ { \mathsf { T M } }$ LC Warfarin Genotyping Kit compared to bi-directional results for the whole blood samples. Only $0 . 4 \%$ (2/450) of the results was discordant and resolved in agreement with the eQ-PCR™M LC Warfarin Genotyping Kit result when bidirectional sequencing was repeated. After re-sequencing the discrepant samples, the overall result demonstrates $100 \%$ clinical sensitivity of the assay's substantial equivalence to bi-directional sequencing.

A study was conducted at two external sites and at TrimGen Corporation to determine the reproducibility of the eQ-PCR™ LC Warfarin Genotyping Kit across days, operators, and sites. A panel of 31 samples was extracted and tested at each of the three sites on each of five days. The panel consisted of whole blood samples. At all sites, separate operators performed the testing on alternate days.

There was no discordance among observed results or between observed and expected results across sites, days or operators. All whole blood and controls gave consistent eQPCRTM LC Warfarin Genotyping Kit results within days, across days, across operators, and across sites. In addition, all genotyping results matched the bi-directional sequencing results.
