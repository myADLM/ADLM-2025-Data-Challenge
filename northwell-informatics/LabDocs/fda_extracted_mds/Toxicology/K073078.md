Device Trade or Proprietary Name:

"Rapid Tox Cup"

Device Common/Usual Name or Classification Name:

Multi-Drug Test System

Classification Number/Class:

(No classification Regulation) / Class II

This 510 (k) summary is being submitted in accordance with requirement of 21 CFR 807.92.

The assigned 510 (k) number is:

# Predicate Device:

The Technology utilized in the 'Rapid Tox Cup' is based on the same principle as that utilized in both "Rapid Tec 4,' 510(k) No. K041712, 'Rapid Tec 5" 510(k) No K023869, and 'Rapid Tox' 510 (k) No. K053359.

# Test Description:

The immunoassays employed in each test strip of the 'Rapid Tox Cup' are based on the same principle of the highly specific reaction between antigens and antibodies.

Each assay consists of a membrane strip onto which up to five different drug conjugates have been immobilized. A colloidal gold-antibody complex consisting of up to five antibodies is dried at one end of the membrane. In the absence of any drug in the urine sample, the colloidal gold-multi-antibody complex moves with the urine sample by capillary action to contact the immobilized drug conjugate. Antibody-antigen reactions occur forming a visible line in all "test" areas. The formation of a visible line in the test areas occur when the test is negative for the adjacent labeled drug.

When drug is present in the urine sample, the drug or metabolite will compete with the immobilized drug conjugate in the test area for the limited antibody binding sites on the colloidal gold-labeled antibody complex, thus preventing attachment of the labeled antibody to the drug conjugate. An absence of a colored line in any of the test areas is indicative of a presumptive positive result.

A control line, comprised of a different antibody/antigen reaction, is present on the membrane strip. The control line is not influenced by the presence or absence of a drug in the urine, and therefore, should be present in all reactions.

A negative urine will produce up to six colored lines, and a positive sample will produce a colored line in the control area and no colored line(s) in the test area corresponding to the individual analyte(s) that are present in the sample.

# INTENDED USE

'Rapid Tox Cup'-is a one-step, lateral flow immunoassay contained in a polypropylene cup for the simultaneous detection of abused drugs in urine. 'Rapid Tox Cup'- is intended for professional use in the qualitative detection of the following drugs of abuse in human urine at the following levels:

The barbiturate BAR, benzodiazepine BZO and tricyclic antidepressant TCA will yield preliminary positive results when BAR, BZO, and TCA is ingested at or above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly recognized drug levels for barbiturate, benzodiazepine, or tricyclic antidepressant in urine. Certain foods or medicines may interfere with tests for Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines, and Tricyclic Antidepressants and may cause positive results.

# Performance Characteristics:

Amphetamine 500 ng/mL Amphetamine 1000 ng/mL Methamphetamine 500 ng/mL Methamphetamine 1000 ng/mL 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) 500 ng/mL 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) 1000 ng/mL Buprenorphine 12.5 ng/mL Benzodiazepines (Oxazepam) 300 ng/mL Barbiturates (Butalbital) 300 ng/mL Oxycodone 100 ng/mL Methadone 300 ng/mL Phencyclidine 25 ng/mL Propoxyphene 300 ng/mL Opiates 300 ng/mL Opiates 2000 ng/mL Cocaine, (Benzoylecgonine 300 ng/mL Cocaine, (Benzoylecgonine) 150 ng/mL Tricyclic Antidepressants, (Nortriptyline) 1000 ng/mL THC/ Cannabinoids (11 norΔ9-THC-9-carboxylic 50 ng/mL

Reproducibility was evaluated using commercially available control urines containing concentrations above and below the stated cut-off. Negative controls were also used. All concentrations were verified by GC/MS. Each sample was tested 4 times, twice daily, for 5 days. The results demonstrate the reproducibility of the 'Rapid Tox Cup' performance.

# Conclusion:

'Rapid Tox Cup' is performs equivalent to 'Rapid Tec,' and 'Rapid Tox' products previously cleared under listed 510k numbers above. The device in (Cup) form houses the identical strips used in these predicate cleared devices which are cassettes or test cards. Testing of the identical strips housed in the Rapid Tox Cup device performed as expected and showed no difference relative to results from the Rapid Tec or Rapid Tox products.

Evaluation and Safety

'Rapid Tox Cup' is intended for professional use. It is not intended for over-the-counter sale to non-professionals. This assay is a simplified screening method that provides only a preliminary result for use in determining the need for additional or confirmatory testing, i.e. gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).

The barbiturate BAR, benzodiazepine BZO and tricyclic antidepressant TCA will yield preliminary positive results when BAR, BZO, and TCA is ingested at or above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly recognized drug levels for barbiturate, benzodiazepine, or tricyclic antidepressant in urine. Certain foods or medicines may interfere with tests for Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines, and Tricyclic Antidepressants and may cause positive results.

There is no calibration necessary and therefore no calibrator needed for this device.

'Rapid Tox Cup' provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific alternate method must be used in order to obtain a more confirmed analytical result. GC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.
