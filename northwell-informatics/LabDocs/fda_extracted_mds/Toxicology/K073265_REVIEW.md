# L. Test Principle:

The nitric oxide concentration in the breath sample is measured using an optical biosensor that changes its light absorption characteristics when exposed to nitric oxide. The biosensor is contained in a single-use, disposable sensor cartridge. The measurement subsystem of the Monitor measures the change in transmission of a narrow spectrum of light through the biosensor in order to calculate the concentration of nitric oxide in the breath sample.

The sensor cartridge controls the concentration of water vapor surrounding the biosensor and conditions the incoming breath sample. Also, CO2 is removed from the breath sample by the breath sample filter with minimal impact on the nitric oxide concentration. Solid-state thermoelectric coolers control the temperature of the sensor cartridge to prevent temperature-induced shifts in optical absorbance.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Clinical Repeatability

Repeatability is defined as the average standard deviation of repeated measurements on a single subject. Clinical repeatability was evaluated by replicate testing on the Apieron INSIGHT eNO System at a single clinical site using 3 operators. Seventy-eight asthma subjects of varying severity were tested twice within a single measurement session. The results of this study were analyzed in clinically significant ranges of eNO concentrations and are provided in the table below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was assessed using 24 samples at each of nine target NO gas concentrations: 0 ppb, 10 ppb, $2 0 \mathrm { p p b }$ , 50 ppb, 80 ppb, 110 ppb, 150 ppb, 200 ppb and $2 4 0 \mathrm { p p b }$ . The degree of nonlinearity was computed as the percentage deviation between the linear fit and the $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ order nonlinear fit relative to the target concentrations. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion was a percentage deviation of $< 5 \%$ at each of the test concentrations within the measurement range.

A regression analysis of NO as measured by the Apieron INSIGHT eNO System versus the known concentration of NO is presented in the table entitled below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The 1 ppm reference gas cylinders are “RATA” (Relative Accuracy Test Audit) indicating that they have been analyzed according to the method described in EPA publication (EPA-600/R-07/121). The cylinders are analyzed directly against a NIST Standard Reference Material (SRM), a NIST traceable Reference Material (NTRM), or a Netherlands Measurement Institute (NMi) Primary Reference Material (PRM). The values of the certified gas are used in the calibration of the Apieron INSIGHT™ eNO System.

The Apieron INSIGHT™ eNO System will initially be labeled with a shelf life (expiration date) of three months. Shelf life testing has been conducted through real-time aging.

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Detection was tested to verify that the Apieron INSIGHT eNO System measurement technology was capable of reliably measuring eNO concentrations at the lowest reported value of $1 0 \mathrm { p p b }$ .

The Limit of Detection (LoD) was assessed as the smallest concentration that can be reliably distinguished from the Limit of Blank (LoB) to a confidence of $9 5 \%$ . According to CLSI Guideline EP 17-A, the LoD is defined as the Limit of Blank (LoB) plus 1.65 times the Standard Deviation of repeated testing at a single low NO concentration. The Limit of Blank was determined by testing 60 simulated breath samples containing no Nitric Oxide (blanks) and calculating the upper $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the mean. The standard deviation of a low concentration was determined by testing 60 samples of simulated breath with 10 ppb of Nitric Oxide.

The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was estimated by determining mean error (bias) and standard deviation of 60 simulated breath samples at 0 and 10 ppb NO. The LoQ was calculated as the absolute value of the mean error at 10 ppb plus 2 times standard deviation of error at 0 ppb. Thus, the LoQ was estimated at $2 . 1 \ \mathrm { p p b }$ . Since the CLSLI Guideline EP17-A specifies that the LoQ cannot be less than the LoD, the sponsor chose the LoQ to be the same as the LoD of $6 . 6 4 \mathrm { p p b }$ .

The result of this analysis is shown in the Table below.

e. Analytical specificity:

Two sets of endogenous interference experiments were conducted. In the first set of experiments, interference testing was performed on the Apieron INSIGHT eNO System for the following common constituents of exhaled breath:

200 ppm $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ (hydrogen) 3 ppm CO (carbon monoxide) • $100 \%$ Relative Humidity (water vapor) $0 . 5 \% \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ (carbon dioxide) 0 ppb NO (nitric oxide)

Twenty-four samples containing all of the above potential interferents (balance air) and 24 samples containing only air were prepared and tested on the Apieron INSIGHT eNO System. The mean difference in response was less than $0 . 0 5 \mathrm { p p b }$ . The sponsor determined that this difference was not statistically significant between the samples containing potential interferents and those containing only air.

In the second set of experiments seven additional compounds were tested at physiologically relevant concentrations by comparing the response of the Apieron INSIGHT eNO System to the test gas (balance nitrogen) to nitrogen alone. The test gas contained 0 ppb NO (nitric oxide). A compound was deemed non-interfering by the sponsor if, at the tested concentration, the response was within $\pm 5$ ppb NO equivalent when compared to the nitrogen control. The table below summarizes the results of this testing.

\*Significant with $\mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 5$

None of the tested compounds exhibited interference greater than $\pm 5$ ppb equivalent NO when compared to a nitrogen control.

Two compounds (ethanol and methanethiol) showed a statistically significant $( \mathrm { p } { < } 0 . 0 5 )$ response at the test concentrations; however, the mean response from both of these compounds was less than 1 ppb.

Clinical Interference Testing (Exogenous Compounds) The influence of mouthwash containing alcohol, alcohol-free mouthwash, toothpaste, breath mints, throat lozenges, carbonated beverage with caffeine and caffeine-free carbonated beverage on eNO was assessed in a clinical study. Twelve healthy adult subjects (9 males and 3 females; mean age $3 6 \pm$ 11.8 yrs; range 20-62 yrs) participated in the clinical study. The eNO measurements for adults ranged from 5 ppb to 99 ppb. The endpoint was the difference in eNO before as compared to one hour after exposure to each compound. None of the tested exogenous compounds were found to interfere (at $\pm 5$ ppb) with the eNO measurement at one hour post-exposure.

In pediatric subjects, the influence of alcohol-free mouthwash, toothpaste, breath mints, and caffeine-free carbonated beverage on eNO was assessed in a clinical study. Seven healthy children (6 males and 1 female; ages 5-17 yrs) participated in the clinical study. The eNO measurements for children ranged from 3 ppb to $2 7 { \mathrm { p p b } }$ . The endpoint was the difference in eNO before as compared to one hour after exposure to each compound. None of the exogenous compounds tested were found to interfere $( \mathrm { a t } \pm 5 \mathrm { p p b } )$ ) with the eNO measurement at one hour post-exposure.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Monitoring the effect of anti-inflammatory therapy in patients with asthma A multi-center study enrolled 73 steroid naïve subjects at 12 sites with uncontrolled asthma and elevated exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) to assess the effect of corticosteroid therapy on eNO. The demographic data for this study are presented below. Testing was performed by 45 trained technicians, including: nurses, respiratory therapists, medical assistants, nurse aides, nurse practitioners and asthma educators. Using the Apieron INSIGHT eNO System, eNO was measured at baseline and after 2 weeks of corticosteroid therapy (follow-up). At study entry, the adult asthmatics all had eNO levels $\geq$ $3 0 { \mathrm { p p b } }$ and the children asthmatics all had eNO levels $\geq 2 5$ ppb. The objective of the study was to show that a change in eNO after therapy was related to a change in asthma symptoms indicating a therapeutic effect of corticosteroid treatment.

A method comparison was conducted using Exhaled Nitric Oxide measurements taken on both the Apieron INSIGHT eNO System and the NIOX System. A study was conducted on 82 non-randomized asthmatic subjects at a single site comparing eNO measurements taken with both the Apieron INSIGHT eNO System and Aerocrine’s NIOX System. The demographic data for this study are presented below. A total of 58 adults (ages ${ \ge } 1 8$ years) and 20 children (ages ${ < } 1 8$ years) completed the study resulting in $\mathrm { n } { = } 7 8$ subjects eligible for analysis. Each subject performed two breath maneuvers on each system. The testing was performed by 3 trained technicians. Results were analyzed to evaluate the performance of the Apieron INSIGHT eNO System as it compares to the NIOX System in a clinical setting.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The labeling includes the information from American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society ERS as follows: “Guidelines for measuring exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) were established in 2005 through the recommendation of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society ERS as studies have demonstrated that a number of factors can affect eNO levels. Reference eNO values for healthy children and adults without asthma, obtained using the standard exhalation rate of $5 0 \mathrm { m l / s }$ , range from 1.6 to $2 8 . 8 \mathrm { p p b }$ . Exhaled nitric oxide levels are higher in patients with asthma (25 to $8 0 \mathrm { p p }$ ), are increased during an asthma exacerbation and are reduced with corticosteroid therapy. Exhaled nitric oxide is also reported to show a dose-dependent response to corticosteroid treatment and the response of eNO to corticosteroids has clinical utility.”

# N. Instrument Name:

Apieron INSIGHT eNO System

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

The Apieron INSIGHT eNO System measures eNO via an optical biosensor that undergoes a change in its optical absorbance when binding with nitric oxide. The change in optical properties is measured with a ratiometric, two-channel optical system that measures the change in light absorbance through the Biosensor, which is contained inside the INSIGHT Sensor. The breath sampling system of the INSIGHT Monitor follows the flow rate and exhalation pressure recommended by the 2005 American Thoracic Society Recommendations.

# 2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this product:

Yes X or No

3. Specimen Identification: There is no mechanism to identify the specimen

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling: The user obtains a breath sample by exhaling into the device.

5. Calibration:

Each sensor is calibrated at the factory and requires no calibration by the user. The monitor electronics are calibrated at the factory and are designed to adjust automatically to minor changes. If there is drift out of range, an error message appears on the screen. The system will not take eNO measurements while the monitor is out of calibration range.

The chemistry of the sensor is completely reversible (i.e., when exposed to an NO-free environment the sensor returns to its pre-exposed state). The response of each Sensor Cartridge to NO is characterized, stored with the Sensor Cartridge, and used to calculate the exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) concentration during a patient test.

# 6. Quality Control:

The Apieron INSIGHT eNO System is designed to include a QC system into the design and manufacturing process of the Monitor and supplies as follows:

• Daily Field System QC Test with controlled test gases at $0 \left( { \pm } 6 \mathrm { p p b } \right)$ ) and 150 ppb $( \pm 3 0 \mathrm { p p b } )$   
• Continuous on-board parameter checking   
• Breath maneuver monitoring   
• Factory calibration of sensor cartridges.

The Field QC Test is designed to detect system malfunctions that could result in significant measurement inaccuracy. The ‘false positive’ rate for the Field QC Test is estimated at approximately $1 \%$ . The daily Field QC Test measures the response of the Apieron INSIGHT eNO System to 0 ppb NO blank and 150 ppb NO gas samples and automatically determines if the response is within acceptable operating parameters. During the breath maneuver, exhalation pressure and flow are continuously checked to ensure compliance with the American Thoracic Society 2005 recommendations. During every test, key operating parameters in the pneumatic, temperature control, and optical systems are automatically checked by the Monitor to ensure proper operation.
