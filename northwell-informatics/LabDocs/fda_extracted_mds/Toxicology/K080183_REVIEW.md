# H. Intended Use:

The Control Set DAT I is for use as an assayed control in the Roche test system for the qualitative and semiquantitative determination of drugs of abuse in human urine on automated clinical chemistry analyzers as indicated in the System Information.

The Control Set DAT II is for use as an assayed control in the Roche test system for the qualitative and semiquantitative determination of drugs of abuse in human urine on automated clinical chemistry analyzers as indicated in the System Information.

The Control Set DAT III is for use as an assayed control in the Roche test system for the qualitative and semiquantitative determination of drugs of abuse in human urine on automated clinical chemistry analyzers as indicated in the System Information.

None of these above named products can be used with the Roche Abuscreen OnLine assay for Amphetamines or the COBAS INTEGRA Amphetamines cobas c pack (AMPS). The package insert or method sheet for information regarding the controls has appropriate instructions for use with these assays.

The Control Set Amphetamine 500 is for use as an assayed control with the Roche Abuscreen OnLine assay for Amphetamines and the COBAS INTEGRA Amphetamines cobas c pack (AMPS) for the qualitative and semiquantitative determination of amphetamines in human urine on automated clinical chemistry analyzers.

2. Indication(s) for use: See Intended Use.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For Prescription Use Only.

4. Special instrument requirements: Roche/Hitachi 911/912/917/MODULAR P analyzers Roche/Hitachi cobas c 501/c 311 COBAS Integra 400/400plus/700/800

# I. Device Description:

These are drug mixture control materials in a human urine matrix. The three sets of controls (Control Set DAT I, II and III) each have two levels of various drug-control mixtures, while the amphetamine controls have two levels of d-amphetamine and are sold ready for use and no preparation is required. The sponsor recommends that before use, the user record the date the control was opened on the bottle label. Donors for the pools of human urine used in the preparation of this product all screened negative in annual serum testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and for antibodies to HIV type 1, HIV type 2, and hepatitis C (anti-HCV).

# L. Test Principle:

Not Applicable.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not Applicable.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The assigned values of the Control Set DAT I, Control Set DAT II, Control Set DAT III, and Control Set Amphetamine 1000, Control Set Amphetamine 500 are traceable to Gas Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) Reference Testing. For each analyte the GC-MS is calibrated with master calibrators. These are made fresh from a concentrated stock stored at $- 2 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . The concentration of the frozen stock is verified every three months by an independent GC-MS laboratory. Five calibrator levels are used to generate the calibration curve on the GC-MS. The material has a closed vial stability claim of 12 months. Real Time stability was assessed by GC/MS testing of unopened, refrigerated vials. After opening the reagents are good for 30 days or until the expiration date, whichever comes first at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .
