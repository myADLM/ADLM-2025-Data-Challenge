The Chromsystems MassCheck Immunosuppressant Whole Blood Controls are in vitro diagnostic devices intended to verify performance of various laboratory assay systems that measure cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or sirolimus.

# Substantial Equivalence Information:

The predicate and proposed devices are similar in the following ways:

Same intended use - in vitro diagnostic devices intended for the calibration and control of laboratory assay systems used in the determination of immunosuppressant specific drug analytes in patient whole blood. Same analytes • Consist of similar matrices (human whole blood) Predicates and proposed devices are supplied lyophilized and mus be reconstituted

These devices differ in the following ways:

The numbers of concentration levels are different.

The Chromsystems MassCheck Immunosuppressants Controls are substantially equivalent to predicate devices which are currently legally marketed via the ${ \bf 5 1 0 ( k ) }$ process intended for similar use, as demonstrated by the information provided in this premarket notification.

Dear Ms. Cambria:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your evic casseeaboveino ith clas II Special nols)r cass I (MA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895.
