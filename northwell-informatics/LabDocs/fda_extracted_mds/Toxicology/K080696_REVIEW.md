# L. Test Principle:

The assay is intended for the quantitative measurement of phenytoin in human serum or plasma using Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA) technology. The patient sample, anti- phenytoin coated paramagnetic microparticles, and phenytoin acridinium-labeled conjugate are combined to create a reaction mixture. The anti-phenytoin coated microparticles bind to phenytoin present in the sample and to the phenytoin acridinium-labeled conjugate. After washing, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). An indirect relationship exists between the amount of phenytoin in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT $i$ System optics.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Following CLSI EP5-A2, the sponsor evaluated the precision using three reagents and three levels of Multi-constituent Controls (MCC) Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 with concentrations at approximately 7, 14, and 25 $\mathrm { { u g / m L } }$ and three serum panels prepared by adding phenytoin into a pool of human sera at approximately 10, 20, and $3 0 \mathrm { u g / m L }$ concentrations of phenytoin. Precision tests were run on three ARCHITECT $i$ systems using three lots of reagents and one lot of calibrators. Studies were carried out in duplicates of two runs per day over 20 days (total of 80 data points). The results are tabulated below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Following CLSI Document EP6-A, the sponsor conducted studies to evaluate the dilution recovery of the ARCHITECT iPhenytoin assay. The sponsor used five individual serum samples and five individual Potassium EDTA (frozen) samples (Phenytoin values: $3 2 { - } 3 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ diluted manually with the ARCHITECT iPhenytoin Calibrator A. Each of the ten samples was diluted to 9 test concentration levels. Testing was done using one reagent lot and running duplicates of each diluent level. The recoveries of the diluted serum samples ranged from $9 9 \%$ to $1 0 7 \%$ and $93 \%$ to $10 5 \%$ for plasma samples.

Based on the recovery data and the limit of detection described below, the sponsor established the assay measuring range for ARCHITECT iPhenytoin assay as $0 . 5 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } - 4 0 . 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

Following CLSI document EP6-A, the sponsor conducted an additional study to further evaluate the measurement range of 0.50 to $4 0 . 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ using Five individual serum samples and 5 individual Potassium EDTA plasma samples (frozen) were each spiked with a $4 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ phenytoin solution to target sample concentration values greater than $4 0 . 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . Each of the ten samples was diluted to 11 concentration levels. One lot of reagents was used to test neat samples in replicates of 4 and diluted samples in duplicates. Each sample was diluted using the ARCHITECT iPhenytoin Calibrator A. The mean percent recovery of the diluted serum samples ranged from $1 0 0 . 6 \%$ to $1 0 6 . 1 \%$ and the mean percent recovery of the diluted plasma samples ranged from $9 9 . 5 \%$ to $1 0 1 . 8 \%$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The calibrators are sold separately and the labeling recommends using commercially available control materials for the quality control procedure. The sponsor provided the protocols for preparation and value assignment for calibrators. The Internal Standard Calibrators are manufactured gravimetrically using purified synthetic Phenytoin from the US Pharmacopeia (USP) Reference Standard. The ARCHITECT iPhenytoin Calibrators are matched to the Internal Standard Calibrators, which consists of calibrator buffer (MES, Dextrose and ProClin 300), Phenytoin and stabilizer. Calibrator A is prepared from human serum and contains sodium azide with ProClin. The target concentrations for Calibrators B-F are 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and $4 0 ~ \mathrm { u g / m L }$ Phenytoin. The stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.

# d. Detection limit:

To determine the lower limit of the assay range, the sponsor evaluated limit of detection (LOD) and limit of blank (LOB) using CLSI document EP17-A “Protocol for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline” The sponsor used 2 instruments, 2 lots of reagents and 2 lots of calibrators for testing on a panel of 5 samples with low phenytoin concentrations and a blank sample with $0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ phenytoin. The samples with phenytoin were prepared by diluting low phenytoin serum sample with a blank sample. Three runs were performed for each reagent lot. Each run consisted of 20 replicates of a blank sample $( 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ and 5 replicates of each low level phenytoin sample for a total of 60 replicates of the blank and 15 replicates of each low level phenytoin samples. Based on the 95th percentile calculation described in the CLSI EP17-A, LOD was determined using the algorithm, LoD $= \mathrm { L o B }$ $\mathrm { ~ 3 ~ } \left[ 1 . 6 4 5 / \left( 1 - 1 / 4 \mathrm { x } \mathrm { d f } \right) \right] \mathrm { o S }$ . Data in the $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ support the claim for the lower limit of the reportable range, $0 . 5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

Following CLSI EP7-A2 guidelines, the sponsor evaluated the effect of endogenous potential interferents on Architect $i$ Phenytoin Assay. The interferents included triglycerides $( 2 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , hemoglobin $( 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , low protein $( 3 ~ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L } )$ , high protein $( 1 0 ~ \mathrm { g / d L } )$ , and bilirubin $( 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ). Five human serum samples with Phenytoin concentrations targeted at 10 and 20 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ were used to prepare the test panel. These human serum samples were spiked with the interferent for the test sample. An equal volume of interferent diluent was spiked into the samples to prepare the control sample. Mean recovery was within $1 0 0 \pm 1 0 \%$ of the control results for the above interferents and at the concentrations tested.

The sponsor evaluated the effect of HAMA and rheumatoid factor (RF) by testing specimens with HAMA and RF to assess their effect on the Architect iPhenytoin Assay. Five human serum samples positive for Phenytoin concentrations targeted at 10 and $2 0 ~ \mathrm { u g / m L }$ were used to prepare the interfering panel. These human serum samples were spiked with the interferent for the test sample. An equal volume of interferent diluent was spiked into the samples to prepare the control sample Mean recovery was within $1 0 0 \pm 1 0 \%$ of the control results for HAMA and RF.

Following CLSI EP7-A2 guidelines, the sponsor conducted a study to evaluate the potential cross-reactivity of the ARCHITECT i Phenytoin assay when tested with structurally similar compounds. For all cross-reactants tested (except Fosphenytoin), two pools of sera, one with essentially no residual phenytoin and one with a low level of phenytoin were split into 3 different parts. Two parts were spiked with phenytoin to reach target concentrations between approximately 9.37 and $2 0 . 2 3 ~ \mathrm { u g / m L }$ and the third part was not spiked with phenytoin. Compounds were spiked into the samples above to prepare the test sample and an equal volume of the interferent diluent was spiked to the samples to prepare the control sample. The test and control samples were tested five times. For the Fosphenytoin testing, two frozen normal human serum containing no phenytoin were spiked with Fosphenytoin and within 10 minutes, tested on the ARCHITECT system. The sponsor defined interference as mean percent recovery greater than $+ / - 1 0 \%$ of initial values at therapeutic concentrations. No interference was detected at the concentrations tested.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: The sponsor performed an in-house evaluation. Measurements from the Architect iPhenytoin were compared to the Abbott Axsym Phenytoin. One hundred fifty-four (154) individual specimens were measured ranging from 1.45 to $3 9 . 6 3 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ as measured on the Architect $i$ System. Six samples were spiked to achieve concentrations at the upper end of the $4 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ measuring range. Two samples were excluded from the analysis because they were below the $0 . 5 0 \mathrm { u g / m L }$ measuring range. The analysis of data using Passing & Bablok produced a regression equation of $\mathrm { y } = \mathrm { . 9 9 6 x } - 0 . 2 6 6 .$ . The following table demonstrates the correlation between the two methods.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope(95% C.I)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept(95% C.I)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CorrelationCoefficient</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>154</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.996(0.980 to 1.011)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.266(0.409 to -0.139)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.993</td></tr></table>

A bias analysis of ARCHITECT iPhenytoin vs. AxSYM Phenytoin was performed on the same 154 specimens in the range of 1.45 to $3 9 . 6 3 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ and 1.44 to $3 5 . 4 9 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ respectively. The average bias exhibited by ARCHITECT vs. AxSYM in this study was $- 3 . 9 5 \%$ . The $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of that average bias is - 18.12 to $1 0 . 2 2 \%$ . Within the typical therapeutic range of phenytoin therapy (10 to $2 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ ), the average bias was - $2 . 7 3 \%$ with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of -14.61 to $9 . 1 5 \%$ .

$b$ . Matrix comparison:

The sponsor conducted matrix comparison studies using 20 matched serum and plasma samples prepared with seven anticoagulants (2K-EDTA, 3KEDTA, Na-Citrate, K-Oxalate, Na-Heparin and Li-Heparin). FDA cleared blood collection tubes were used. Serum tubes without anticoagulants were used as the control. To evaluate the anticoagulant effect along the assay measuring range, each of the 20 sets of serum/plasma tubes were spiked with phenytoin to obtain five matched sets below the therapeutic range (0.5 to $< 1 0$ $\mathrm { { u g / m L } }$ , 10 matched sets to target within the therapeutic range (10 to 20 $\mathrm { u g / m L ) }$ and 5 matched sets to target above the therapeutic range $( > 2 0$ to $< / =$ $4 0 \mathrm { u g / m L }$ ). The samples were analyzed in triplicate with one lot of ARCHITECT $i$ Phenytoin reagents on the ARCHITECT $i$ System. Mean recovery was within $1 0 0 \pm 1 0 \%$ vs. serum results.
