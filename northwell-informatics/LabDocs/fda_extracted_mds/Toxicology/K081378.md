Common Name: Methadone Test System   
Device Classification: 21 CFR 862.3620 Methadone Test System; Class II 21 CFR 862.3200 Clinical Toxicology Calibrator; Class II 21 CFR 862.3280 Clinical Toxicology Control Material; Class I

# INTENDED USE

The DRI Methadone Metabolite (100/300) Assay is intended for the qualitative and semi-quantitative determination of the presence of Methadone Metabolite (2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrolidine or EDDP) in human urine at cutoffs of 100 and 300 ng/mL.

The assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result.A more specific altemative chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result.Gas chromatography / Mass spectrometry (GC/S) is the preferred confimatory method. Clinical and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary results are used.Tests for methadone metabolite cannot distinguish between abused drugs and certain prescribed medications. Certain foods or medications may interfere with test for methadone metabolite and cause false positive results.

The DRI Methadone Metabolite Calibrators are intended for use in calibration of the DRI Methadone Metabolite (100/300) Assay.

The DRI Methadone Metabolite Controls are intended for use in the DRI Methadone Metabolite (100/300) Assay to detect and monitor systematic deviations from accuracy resulting from reagent or instrument defects.

# LEGALLY MARKETED DEVICE TO WHICH EQUIVALENCY IS CLAIMED

The DRMethadMetabolite 00/3) ssay is substantially euivalent he reviusl cea CEDIA DAU EDDP Assay (K980746, Microgenics Corporation).

The DR1 Methadone Metabolite Calibrators are substantially equivalent to the previously cleared CEDIA DAU Multi-Drug Calibrators (K980853, Microgenics Corporation).

The DRI Methadone Metabolite Controls are substantialy equivalent to the previously cleared MGC DAU Control Sets: Primary, Clinical, Select (K040758, Microgenics Corporation).

# DESCRIPTION OF DEVICE

The DRI Methadone Metabolite (100/300) Assay utilizes liquid ready-to-use reagents. The Antibody/Substrate Reagent (R1) contains mouse monoclonal anti-EDDP antibody, glucose-6-phosphate (GP), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD) in Tris buffer with sodium azide as a preservative.The Enzyme Conjugate Reagent (R2) contains EDDP-derivative labeled with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in Tris buffer with sodium azide as a preservative.

The assay uses specific antibodies that can detect EDDP in human urine without cross-reactivity to the parent drug methadone. The assay is based on competition between drug labeled with glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and free drug from the sample for a fixed number of specific antibody binding ss.nthe presenceofreedrg from the sample, thefree drg oupis theantiy n sites, allwng thedrug-labeld GPD tointeract wit the substrate,resulting nenzyme activity.Ine absence of free drug from the sample, the specifiantibody binds the drug labeled with GPDH and causes a decrease in enzyme activity.This phenomenon creates a direct relationship between drug concentration in urine and enzyme activity. This enzyme activity is determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm by measuring its ability to convert nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH.

# SUMMARY OF CLINICAL TESTING

# Sensitivity

Sensitivity measured semi-quantitatively as limit of quantitation (LOQ) was 14 ng/mL.

# Precision

A precision study was performed using the CLSI guideline EP5-A2: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline  Second Edition

For qualitative mode acceptance criteria required hat all samples spike at levels below the cutof rd as negative and all samples spiked at levels above the cutoff read as positive.

F $8 \%$ CV and target total-run precision was less than or equal to $10 \%$ Cv.

The within-un and total-u precision at ll levels of the 00 cutoff and the 300 cutoff met tget specifications in both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes.

# Cutoff Characterization  Spike Recovery

In qualitative mode, the control levels were recovered acurately, with the negative controls recoverig less tcular e sino ahcolaro was observed between cutoff levels and their $\pm z 5 \%$ levels, with $9 5 \%$ statistical confidence. The precision of the 21 replicates was $< 1 \%$ CV.

In se-quantitative mode, recovery was less thn $1 5 \%$ error of the nominal values and the precision  the 21 replicates was below $3 \%$ CV.

# Linearity  Dilution Recovery

A high sample containing around 1000 ng/ml methadone metabolite was serially diluted in $10 \%$ increments with analyte-free urine. Recovery was within $10 \%$ of expected values, with a correlation coefficient of $r =$ 0.9990.

# Interferences

Results demonstrate that no significant interference was observed from endogenous and exogenous urine substances at the tested concentrations and the pH range of 4 to 11.

# Specificity

Cross-reactivity to metabolites and structurally related compounds was tested on spiked samples in both the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. All compounds tested negative, with rate below the 100 ng/mL cutoff rate and with dose recovered less than 100 ng/mL, indicating that the assay does not cross react with compounds at the tested concentrations.

# Method Comparison

A total of 100 unaltered patient urine samples containing various concentrations of methadone metabolite were tested in both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. Approximately $10 \%$ of the samples included in the study had concentrations between cutoff and 50% above the cutoff, and approximately 10% of the samples had concentrations between cutoff and $50 \%$ below the cutoff.

Samples were tested by:

DRI Methadone Metabolite Assay (on-test method) 0 CEDIA DAU EDDP Assay (predicate device) GC/MS (reference analytical method)

# Qualitative Results

At the100 ng/mL cuto, the overall concordance between the DRI Assay and the predicate CEDIA Assay was $9 5 \%$ . The overall concordance between DRI and GC/MS was also $9 5 \%$ .

At the 300 cutoff, the overall concordance between the DRI and GC/MS was $9 9 \%$ .

# Semi-quantitative Results

At he100 cutof theoverall concordance between he DR Assay and he predicate CEDIA Assy was $9 9 \%$ The overall concordance to GC/MS was also $9 9 \%$

At the 300 cutoff, the overall concordance between the DRI Assay and GC/MS was $100 \%$ .

# CONCLUSION

As summarized, the DR! Methadone Metabolite (100/300) Assay is substantially equivalent to the CEDIA DAU EDDP Assay. Substantial equivalence has been demonstrated through performance testing to verify that the device functions as intended and that design specifications have been satisfied.
