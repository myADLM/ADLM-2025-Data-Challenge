# I. Device Description:

The IA ALIs is a self-contained device that uses a semiconductor-based gas sensor and disposable straws for breath sampling and three 7-segment LED displays present the detected alcohol level.   
On the upper part of the screen there are fifteen lights for visual indication of the level of alcohol detected.   
The LED screen displays the user's blood alcohol equivalent concentration in two decimal places.   
On the bottom part of the screen there are four boxes for user instructions (step 1, step 2, step 3 and Wait).   
The device starts working when money is inserted into the machine. After the WAIT light goes on and the system performs a cleaning process, the BLOW light goes on and there is a beep when the device is ready to accept an air sample.   
As the user exhales with the straw into the hole, the device monitors the air pressure and blowing time. If the flow of the breath sample is sufficient, the indicator BLOW light goes from flashing to solid and the WAIT light goes on. Thereafter the system processes the air sample and gives a numerical result.

# Use instructions:

The machine waits for a coin or bill to be inserted and then measures the amount of alcohol on BAC and displays the results. The operation has two stages:

# Stage 1: Waiting for coin/bill

The "Step 1" light flashes while the device is waiting for a coin/bill to be inserted. During this stage, the control card is monitoring the sensor's temperature using an on/off control circuit. The temperature is controlled between 34C and 38C as required by the alcohol sensor manufacturer.

# Stage 2: Money Insertion

As soon as a coin/bill is detected, the following process begin:

The control card generates a beep indicating that a valid input for the coin/bill has been inserted. All LED's on the screen are turned off. The air pump is turned on for 5 seconds for cleaning and decontaminating the sensor and air conducts. The sensor heater is exposed to $+ 5 . 5 V$ The system waits for the user to blow air into the device. They should take a straw to blow air into the machine. At the same time Step 3 light flashes (BLOW until WAIT light appears). After the sample has been collected the WAlT signal turns on. The system analyzes the sample for about 5 seconds. After the analysis is completed, the result is shown in the display; Meanwhile, the machine starts a cleaning process in which the alcohol sensor is decontaminated by increasing its voltage from 5V to $5 . 5 V$ and the air pump is turned on for 20 seconds to clear the air conducts off any residues. If the result of the test was higher or equal to $0 . 1 2 \%$ BAC, the cleaning process is repeated twice. If the result was higher or equal to $0 . 2 0 \%$ , the cleaning process is repeated three times The control voitage returns to its nominal 5V value.

# Interpretation of results:

If the sample is less than $0 . 0 2 \%$ BAC no alcohol detected 3.If the sample is greater than $0 . 0 2 \%$ BAC alcohol detected

# L. Test Principle:

The sensing material in the type of gas sensor we use in the Impair Aware ALIS is metal oxide SnO2.

Explanation of how it works:

When a metal oxide crystal SnO2 is heated at high temperature in air, oxygen is adsorbed on the crystal surface with a negative charge. Then donor electrons in the crystal surface are transferred to the adsorbed oxygen, resulting in leaving positive charges in a space charge layer. Thus, surface potential is formed to serve as a potential barrier against electron flow. Inside the sensor, electric current flows through the conjunction parts (grain boundary) of SnO2 micro crystals. At grain boundaries, adsorbed oxygen forms a potential barrier which prevents carriers from moving freely. The electrical resistance of the sensor is attributed to this potential barrier. In the presence of a deoxidizing gas, the surface density of the negatively charged oxygen decreases, so the barrier height in the grain boundary is reduced. The reduced barrier height decreases sensor resistance. The relationship between sensor resistance and the concentration of gas can be expressed by the following equation:

$$
R S = A [ C ] - a
$$

Where: Rs $=$ electrical resistance of the sensor   
$\mathsf { A } =$ constant   
$[ { \mathsf { C } } ] =$ alcohol concentration   
${ \mathfrak { a } } =$ slope of Rs curve

This resistance change can then be converted to a breath alcohol concentration which in turn is converted to a blood alcohol concentration.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility

This device was not tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The sponsor performed their own testing and collected performance data using the NHTSA requirements for precision and accuracy as a guide. These tests consist of 20 trials at a Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of 0.008, 20 trials at a BAC of 0.032. Blood Alcohol Concentrations are simulated in breath by a Breath Alcohol Sample Simulator (BASS), "MARK IIA SIMULATOR", which provides an alcohol-in-air test sample with known alcohol level. The IA ALIS met all of the applicable NHTSA requirements for precision and accuracy.

Summary results were as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentration</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.008%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.032%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.00%BAC</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.03% BAC</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20</td></tr></table>

# b. Blank Reading

The NHTSA requirements for the Blank Reading: These tests consist of 20 trials under normal laboratory conditions at 0.00% BAC with non-alcoholic human breath for breath devices and non alcoholic bodily fluids.

Summary results were as follows:

<table><tr><td>Concentration</td><td>0.00%</td></tr><tr><td>0.00% BAC</td><td>20</td></tr></table>

# c. Linearity/assay reportable range:

This device will report concentrations from $0 . 0 0 \%$ to $0 . 4 0 \%$ BAC However, the DOT Model Specifications require accuracy and precision testing up to a concentration of $0 . 0 3 \%$ BAC only; therefore, true linearity over the entire measuring range of the device was not evaluated. This device met all of the applicable NHTSA requirements for precision and accuracy as described above.

d. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

This device is traceable to a commercially available certified alcohol reference solution at a concentration of 0.10% BAC. This solution is used to calibrate the devices when manufactured.

The acceptance criterion for accuracy is $\pm 1 0 \%$ or $\pm 0 . 0 1 \%$ BAC

e. Detection limit:

The ALIS machine will report concentrations from 0.00% to 0.40% BAC.

# f. Analytical specificity: (Cigarette Smoke)

The sponsor evaluated the possibility of cigarette smoke interference with the device. Five alcohol-free volunteers were asked to conduct five breath alcohol tests for each device cut-off concentration while smoking a cigarette. The testing was spread out to cover the duration of time it took to smoke a complete cigarette. The IA ALIs Alcohol Tester produced no false positives results under these conditions.

g. Temperature:

40 devices were tested at $4 0 \%$ , 20 trials at a concentration of $0 . 0 0 8 \%$ BAC, and   
20 trials at $0 . 0 3 2 \%$ BAC. We also performed 20 trials at $1 0 ^ { \circ } C$ and $2 5 \%$ .

Summary results were as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentration</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10°C</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>25°C</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>40°C</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.008% BAC</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20/40</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20/40</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20/40</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.032% BAC</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20/40</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20/40</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20/40</td></tr></table>

Note: The results are 20 trials / 40 devices

# h. Vibration:

IA ALIS is a non-portable system, which is not subjected to any source of external or internal vibration. The system remains in a given site where users are moving towards it to take the test.

The IA ALIS was placed on a vibration table for 5 minutes and twenty samples were performed using a Breath Alcohol Sample Simulator. The results are presented in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentration</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10- 30 Hz</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>30- 60 Hz</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.008</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20/20</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20/20</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.032</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20/20</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20/20</td></tr></table>

# f. Assay cut-off:

For the purposes of performance testing, a BAc Cut-off of $0 . 0 2 \%$ was used to distinguish positive from negative samples.

All U.S. states have long-standing laws prohibiting driving while impaired by alcohol. In 49 states, it is also illegal to operate a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) above a specified limit. As of June 7, 2004 these states along with the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, have adopted $0 . 0 8 ~ \%$ BAC as the legal level of intoxication.

The sponsor states that drivers may be impaired at a BAC of $0 . 0 2 \%$ or more and recommends they do not operate a motor vehicle at or above this concentration.

# 2. Comparison studies:

a. Method of comparison with predicate device:

The sponsor performed a consumer study to determine if consumers could correctly use and interpret the device using only the supplied instructions on the front panel, and to compare the results to a device (AlcoMateCA2oo0). There were 65 paired comparisons, and the volunteers ranged in ages from 25 to 65 years (12 females and 53 males). Immediately afterward, the participants were administered a breath alcohol test using an AlcoMateCA2o00 operated by a trained individual. The breath alcohol concentrations ranged from $0 . 0 0 \% \mathsf { B A C }$ to 0.16%BAC (by the AlcoMateCA2000). Linear regression analysis of the data yielded a slope of 0.9976, a y-intercept of 0 and a correlation coefficient of 0.9892. After the study, participants were asked questions about ease of use and interpretation.

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable.

c. Other clinical supportive data: Not applicable

4Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Using these types of devices, alcohol is not detectable in the breath of persons who have not ingested alcohol.

# 6. Software:

FDA has reviewed the applicant's Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes X_or No_ (see annex 7,8,9)

7. Specimen Identification:

There is no mechanism to identify the specimen.

8. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The user provides a breath sample by exhaling into the device. The instrument checks for adequate breath flow and volume during sampling.

# 9. Calibration:

The device is calibrated at the factory before is sent. The sponsor recommends a recalibration interval of three months (typical) or 300 uses. Whichever comes first.

The reasoning for the recalibration interval is because the bill capacity and the straw capacity are set at 300; for convenience we have set this value (300) as the estimated time frame to check on calibration. We consider that it's safer to set a calibration time so that our machines can always have excellent accuracy. See annexe 1 for more details.

# 10. Quality Control:

There are no external quality controls available for the consumer version of this device.

# . Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the labeling requirements of 21 CFR 801.60, 21 CFR 801.61 and 21 CFR 801.62 for Over-the-Counter devices. (See annexe 6)

# R. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision. (see annex 6)
