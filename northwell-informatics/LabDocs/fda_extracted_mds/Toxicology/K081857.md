# Device Description(s):

The automated Dimension $\underline { { \widehat { \mathbb { R } } } }$ SIRO method uses an immunoassay technique in which free and sirolimus-bound antibody-enzyme conjugates are separated using magnetic particles. The assay is performed using a method specific Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge. The Flex $\mathfrak { B }$ cartridge contains a pretreatment reagent, antibody- $\cdot \ B .$ -galactosidase conjugate, sirolimus immobilized on chromium dioxide particles, chlorophenol red 0-d-galactopyranoside (CPRG) substrate, and diluent to hydrate the tablets.

To perform the SIRO assay, a sample cup (or SSC) containing the whole blood sample to be analyzed and a SIRO Flex $\mathfrak { P }$ reagent cartridge are placed appropriately on the Dimension $\mathfrak { W }$ system. The Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ system mixes and lyses the whole blood sample. The lysed sample is then mixed with the antibody enzyme conjugate. The sirolimus present in the sample is bound by the sirolimus antibody conjugate reagent. Magnetic particles coated with sirolimus are added to bind free (unbound) antibody-enzyme conjugate. The reaction mixture is then separated magnetically. Following separation, the supernatant containing the sirolimus-antibody-enzyme complex is transferred to another cuvette and mixed with the substrate. B-galactosidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of CPRG (chlorophenol red $\ B .$ -d-galactopyranoside) to produce CPR (chlorophenol red) that absorbs light maximally at $5 7 7 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ . The change in absorbance at $5 7 7 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ due to the formation of CPR is directly proportional to the amount of sirolimus in the patient's sample and is measured using a bichromatic (577, 700 nm) rate technique.

The Dimension® Sirolimus Calibrator (DC306) is an in-vitro diagnostic product intended to be used to calibrate the Dimension $\mathfrak { B }$ Sirolimus method. It is a frozen liquid product packaged as a single vial for each of five levels. The matrix is human whole blood hemolysale with preservatives. Levels 2, 3, 4, and 5 contain sirolimus drug at target values of 5, 10, 20, and 31.5 ng/mL, respectively. Level 1 is a human whole blood hemolysate that does not contain sirolimus drug.

# Intended Use:

# SIRO Flex® reagent cartridge

The SIRO method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of Sirolimus in human whole blood on the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ clinical chemistry system. Measurements of Sirolimus are used as an aid in the management of sirolimus therapy in renal transplant patients.

# Sirolimus Calibrator

The Sirolimus calibrator is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of Sirolimus (SIRO) on the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ clinical chemistry system.

# Substantial Equivalence:

The reproducibility testing was conducted in accordance with the CLSl Approved Guideline for User Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices EP5-A2. For each test level, a single test from two independent cups was analyzed twice per day. Testing was conducted with one reagent lot across multiple instruments at one internal and two external locations. The repeatability and within-lab standard deviations were calculated by the analysis of variance method independently for each site. The data above is representative of the results obtained in the reproducibility testing.

# Comments on Substantial Equivalence and Conclusion:

Both the Abbott IMx Sirolimus (k042411) and the Siemens Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Siro immunoassays arc intended for the quantitative determination of sirolimus. The Siemens Dimension $\mathfrak { P }$ Siro and the predicate Abbott IMx Sirolimus immunoassays are substantially equivalent based on their intended use, performance characteristics, and method comparison to the referencc HPLC/MS as described above.

Dear Mr. Plummer:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class ⅡI (Special Controls) or class Ⅲ (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies.
