Device Name: Tradename: Acetaminophen $\mathrm { L } 3 \mathrm { K } ^ { \textcircled { \ 8 } }$ Assay FDA Regulation Name: 862.3030 Colorimetry, Acetaminophen FDA Product Code: LDP

Predicate Device: Genzyme Diagnostics P.E.I. Inc. (K042330)

Device Description: For the quantitative measurement of acetaminophen in serum and plasma. Measurement of acetaminophen is used in the diagnosis and treatment of acetaminophen overdose toxicity. Excessive amounts of acetaminophen leads to hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. In acute overdosage, acetaminophen can cause severe hepatic damage leading to hepatic failure if untreated.

Reagent is a two-part liquid in plastic bottles packaged in the appropriate box.

# Intended Usc

For the quantitative measurement of acetaminophen in serum and plasma. Measurement of acctaminophen is used in the diagnosis and treatment of severe liver damage caused by overdose toxicity. Excessive amounts of acetaminophen leads to hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. In acute overdosage, acetaminophen can cause severe hepatic damage leading to hepatic failure if untreated. For IN VITRO diagnostic use.

Description of the Item Being Compared:

For the In Vitro quantitative measurement

Acetaminophen Enzyme Reagent (R1): buffer $\mathrm { ( p H ~ 8 . 6 ~ }$ at $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) 0.2 mmol/L $\mathrm { M n C l _ { 2 } { \bullet } 4 H _ { 2 } O , \Xi 0 . 9 \ : K U / I }$ Acyl Amidohydrolase, surfactant, preservatives.

Acetaminophen Color Reagent (R2): 0.1 mol/L sodium carbonate buffer $( \mathsf { p H }$ 12.2 at $2 5 ^ { \circ } C$ ), 30 mmol/L 8-hydroxyquinolinc-5-sulfonic acid, surfactant, preservatives.

Acetaminophen Standard: buffer $\mathrm { ( \mathfrak { p } H ~ 5 . 0 ~ }$ at $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ), $1 0 0 0 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ (15.1 mg/dL) acetaminophen, preservatives.

# Similaries:

The submission device and the predicate device have the same intended use.

The submission device and the predicate device both use Aryl Acylamidase enzyme mnethod in acetaminophen measurement.

The submission device and the predicate device have the same oxidative coupling method.

# Differences:

The predicate device uses a different chromophore in the oxidative coupling reaction during color development.

The predicate devices uses 8 hydroxyquinoline and the submission device uses 2,5 dimethylphenol.

Comments on Substantial Equivalence:

Testing results demonstrate that the Acetaminophen $\mathrm { \underline { { ~ L 3 K } } } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Assay is equivalent to the predicate device. Method comparison results provided the following:

# Serum

Deming regression using NCCLS EP9-A2.

A comparison was made between this method and a similar acetaminophen method using 100 samples in serum ranging from 26 to $2 3 6 1 \Phi \mathrm { m o l / L }$ .The correlation coefficient was 0.9999. Deming regression analysis gavc the following equation:

This method $= 1 . 0 6 0$ (reference method) $+$ 4.6 Φmol/L

Confidence interval is $9 5 \%$ . Correlation coefficient is 0.9999. The amount of scatter around the estimate regression line is 8.9. The approach is not different from the predicate device.

# Plasma

A comparison was made bctwcen serum and plasma using 25 samples ranging from 30 to $2 4 4 1 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ . The correlation coefficient was 0.9999. Linear regression analysis gave the following equation:

This method $\mathbf { ( { p l a s m a } ) } = 0 . 9 9 9$ [This method (serum)] -2.2 µumol/L

# Conclusion:

Genzyme Diagnostics P.E.I. Inc. Acetaminophen $\mathrm { L } 3 \mathrm { K } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Assay is substantially cquivalent in principle and performance to the predicate product.

Dear Ms. White:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class Ⅱ (Special Controls) or class Ⅲ (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In adition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
