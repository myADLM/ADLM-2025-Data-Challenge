# DEVICE DESCRIPTION

807.92(a)(4)

The Alco Tube Plus Alcohol Detector (Tester) is a visual qualitative test for the presence of alcohol in human breath. The tester is constituted of glass tubing containing a reagent of yellow crystals that change color when exposed to alcohol vapors. The other part is an opening to blow into while running the test.

If alcohol is present, the crystals will change from yellow to green. How many crystals turn color will depend on the cut-off of the Tester and how much alcohol is in the breath.

The yellow crystals are coated with Potassium dichromate and sulfuric acid. The amount of these indicator chemicals is adjusted according to the selected cutoff of the Tester. A color change is produced when alcohol vapors are oxidized to acetic acid and the indicator chemicals change to chromium sulfate. The majority of crystals change from yellow to green when alcohol vapors are present at a level equal to or exceeding the cutoff of the Tester.

The Alco Tube Plus is available in two cut-offs $( 0 . 0 5 \%$ and $0 . 0 8 \%$ The cut-off is printed in the instructions and is expressed as a specific percentage of breath alcohol

# DEVICE INTENDED USE

# 807.92(a)(5)

The Alco Tube Plus Alcohol Detector is an in vitro medical device to qualitatively detect the presence of alcohol in the human breath. It is a disposable screening device for onetime use. The detector is available in two cut-offs including 0.05 and 0.08 percent breath alcohol. The device is used only as a screening device and is only an indication of the possible presence of alcohol in the blood of the test subject. Correlation between breath alcohol content and blood alcohol content depends on many variables. Alco Tube Plus is not intended to legally determine blood alcohol presence, level, or inference of intoxication.
