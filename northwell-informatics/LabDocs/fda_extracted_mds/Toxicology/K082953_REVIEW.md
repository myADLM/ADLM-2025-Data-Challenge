# L. Test Principle:

The ARCHITECT iDigoxin assay is a one-step STAT immunoassay for the quantitative measurement of digoxin in human serum or plasma using CMIA technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex. Sample, antidigoxin coated paramagnetic microparticles, assay diluent, and digoxigenin acridinium-labeled conjugate are combined to create a reaction mixture. The antidigoxin coated microparticles bind to digoxin present in the sample and to the digoxigenin acridinium-labeled conjugate. After washing, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). An indirect relationship exists between the amount of digoxin in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT i System optics

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

All performance characteristics were established on the ARCHITECT i2000SR system.

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision was performed with the ARCHITECT iDigoxin assay based on the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (CLSI EP5-A2 guideline).

Two ARCHITECT i $2 0 0 0 _ { S R }$ Systems were used along with 2 lots of reagents and 2 lots of calibrators. The assay was run twice a day for 20 days using 3 Multi-constituent Controls and 3 human serum based panels in replicates of 2.

The 3 human serum based panels were prepared by adding digoxin concentrations into a pool of human sera at final concentrations targeted at 0.80, 2.00 and $3 . 6 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Five pooled serum samples (1.80, 2.40, 3.00, 3.60 and $3 . 9 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ) were diluted manually with the ARCHITECT iDigoxin Calibrator A. Each sample was diluted to have 11 concentration levels. Each sample was diluted using the ARCHITECT iDigoxin Calibrator A. The concentration of digoxin was determined using the ARCHITECT iDigoxin assay and the resulting percent deviation from linearity or concentration difference was calculated. For diluted samples reading above $1 . 0 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , the percent deviation from linearity ranged from 4.0 to $8 . 8 \%$ . For diluted samples below $1 . 0 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , the concentrations were within $0 . 1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ of the expected results. The regression equations for the five samples are shown in the table below. The linear range of the assay is 0.3 to $4 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Internal Reference Calibrators are manufactured gravimetrically using purified synthetic Digoxin from US Pharmacopeia (USP) Reference Standard Digoxin. The ARCHITECT iDigoxin Calibrators are manufactured using normal human serum and matched to the internal Reference Calibrators.

The normal human serum used in the calibrators has been tested by an FDA approved method and found to be nonreactive for HIV-1/2 Antibody, HCV Antibody, HTLV-1/2 Antibody, HBc Antibody and HBsAg.

Real time stability testing is ongoing. Based on accelerated stability results, the data support an expiration date of 9 months for ARCHITECT iDigoxin Calibrator Kits at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

Open-vial real time stability testing for the calibrators is ongoing. Testing currently supports a storage time of 4 months at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

A study was conducted to determine the limit of the blank (LoB) and the limit of detection (LoD) for the ARCHITECT iDigoxin assay using the ARCHITECT $\mathrm { i } 2 0 0 0 _ { \mathrm { S R } } ,$ . System following CLSI guideline 17-A. The determinations were performed using one blank, assayed 60 times and four samples containing low concentrations of digoxin assayed 15 times. The limit of blank obtained was $0 . 0 7 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ and limit of detection was $0 . 0 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

A functional sensitivity study was performed using a series of seven samples ranging from 0.05 to $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ which were prepared by diluting Calibrator B with Calibrator A. These samples were tested in replicates of ten two times per day for five days using one reagent and calibrator lot for a total of 100 replicates per panel. The total $\%$ CVs were calculated and plotted against the mean concentration. A reciprocal curve was fitted through the data, and the functional sensitivity value was calculated as the concentration corresponding to the $20 \%$ CV level of the fitted curve. At the upper $9 5 \%$ confidence limit, the lowest ARCHITECT i Digoxin assay value exhibiting a $20 \%$ CV was calculated to be $0 . 1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , which is below the reportable range of the ARCHITECT i Digoxin assay.

The measuring range is 0.3 to $4 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

A study was conducted to evaluate the potential interference from triglycerides, hemoglobin, bilirubin, protein (low and high level), HAMA and Rheumatoid Factor (RF) in the ARCHITECT iDigoxin assay using the ARHITECT i $2 0 0 0 _ { S R }$ system.

Interference testing was performed on the ARCHITECT $i$ System. Testing was performed based on guidance from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute document CLSI Document EP7-A2.

No influence from the endogenous interfering substances tested was observed during the study.

Five serum specimens with digoxin levels ranging from 0.35 to $2 . 8 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ were supplemented with the following potentially interfering compounds. The mean recovery observed during the study ranged from $9 9 . 1 \%$ to $1 0 4 . 8 \%$ . The following table is included in the reagent package insert. Results are shown below:

_c\*: Not determined. The value obtained is outside the assay range

In addition, the labeling contains the following information:

“The sera from patients in specific patient populations (i.e., patients with renal and/or hepatic failure, newborn infants, and pregnant women) have been reported to contain an unidentified component that gives positive results for digoxin with a number of immunoassays. This component has been called digoxin-like immunoreactive factor (DLIF) or substance (DLIS). The presence of DLIF in a sample can result in falsely elevated digoxin assay

results. The amount of DLIF in these patient samples is extremely variable, but in some cases these levels have been shown to approach concentrations that are in the therapeutic range of digoxin. As with any assay employing mouse antibodies, the possibility exists for interference by HAMA in the sample, which could falsely elevate or depress results. The manufacturer of Digoxin Immune Fab has stated that no immunoassay technique is suitable for quantitating digoxin in serum from patients on antibody fragment therapy. According to the manufacturer’s insert, DIGIBIND will interfere with digitalis immunoassay measurements.”

“It has been reported in the literature that one in ten patients converts $40 \%$ or more of oral digoxin to an inactive reduction product (dihydrodigoxin) via bacteria in the gut. There is little or no cross-reactivity reported for dihydrodigoxin.”

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A study was performed using 200 serum and plasma (heparin and EDTA) samples with values ranging from $0 . 3 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ to $3 . 9 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ using the ARCHITECT iDigoxin Reagents on the Architect $\mathrm { i } 2 0 0 0 _ { S R }$ vs. predicate Multigent Digoxin on the Aeroset system. The results are shown in the table below:

b. Matrix comparison:

Three plasma tube types and one serum specimen tube were collected from 20 individuals. Serum tubes without additives were used as the control. Human serum and plasma specimens were collected in the following tube types:

- serum no additive - potassium EDTA (K-EDTA)

- sodium heparin (Na-heparin) - lithium heparin (Li-heparin)

Each of the 20 sets of serum/plasma tubes were spiked with digoxin to achieve 10 different spiking concentrations (0.30, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80, 1.20, 1.60, 2.00, 2.80, 3.20 and $3 . 6 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ). Two tubes of each collecting tube type were used for each spiking level. The results are provided in the following table:

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The Expected Values for ARCHITECT iDigoxin have been established based on bibliography references.

The statement presented in the package insert is as follows:

“The ARCHITECT iDigoxin assay accurately quantitates digoxin concentrations in human serum or plasma at concentrations up to $4 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Numerous studies have shown a relationship between serum levels of digoxin and its concentration in myocardial and other tissues. Optimum therapeutic effects usually are observed when serum levels are in the range from 0.8 to $2 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ based on radioimmunoassay, although some clinical benefit may be realized at serum or plasma concentrations below $0 . 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The risk of toxicity increases at serum or plasma levels above $2 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Symptoms of digoxin toxicity may include gastrointestinal disturbances such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, central nervous system disturbances manifested by blurred or yellow vision, headache, weakness, dizziness, apathy, and confusion, and cardiac rhythm disturbances and tachycardia. There is some evidence that children may tolerate slightly higher serum or plasma concentrations than adults. It is important to note that the distinction between adequate digitalization and toxicity in patients cannot be made on the basis of digoxin concentrations alone. Most studies show a significant overlap between the toxic and nontoxic groups. Additional factors to consider when evaluating the correct therapeutic dosage for each patient are lean body weight, age, renal function, concomitant disease states, concurrent medications, and other clinical factors.”

The literature references are provided in the package insert for the statements above.
