# 4. Device Deseription

The Emit® 2000 Sirolimus Assay is for in vitro diagnostic use for the quantitative analysis of sirolimus in human whole blood as an aid in the management of sirolimus thcrapy in kidney transplant patients. The Emit $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 2000 Sirolimus Assay is comprised of an antibody reagent, a buffer reagent and an enzyme reagent. This assay contains mouse monoclonal antibodies with a high specificity for sirolimus.

The Emit® 2000 Siro/Tacro Sample Pretreatment Reagent is an accessory reagent for use with the Emit $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2000 Sirolimus Assay. The Emit® 2000 Siro/Tacro Sample Pretreatment Reagent is used to pretreat the whole blood samples, calibrators, and controls prior to testing with the Emit® 2000 Sirolimus Assay. The pretreatment process lyses the cells, extracts the sirolimus, and precipitates most of the blood proteins. The pretreated samples are centrifuged, and an aliquot of the resulting supernatant containing sirolimus is then assayed using the Emit $\circled{8}$ 2000 Sirolimus Assay.

The Emit $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2000 Sirolimus Calibrators are frozen material containing sirolimus in preserved whole blood hemolysate. There are six (6) calibrator levels containing 0, 3, 6, 12, 24 and $3 6 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

# 5. Device Intended Use

The Emit® 2000 Sirolimus Assay is for the in vitro quantitative analysis of sirolimus in human whole blood as an aid in the management of sirolinus therapy in kidney transplant patients.

The Emit® 2000 Siro/Tac Sample Pretreatment Reagent is an accessory reagent for use with the Emit $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 2000 Sirolimus Assay and/or the Emit $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 2000 Tacrolimus Assay.

The Emit $\mathfrak { P }$ 2000 Sirolimus Calibrators are intended for use in the calibration of the Emit 2000 Sirolimus Assay.

6. Medical device to which equivalence is claimed and comparison information

The Emit® 2000 Sirolimus Assay is substantially equivalent in intended use and technological characteristics to the Abbott $\operatorname { I M } \mathbf { x } \textcircled { \mathbb { R } }$ Sirolimus Assay. Both devices are immuroassays intended for use in the quantitative measurement of sirolimus in human whole blood. Both devices require a manual pretreatment. The Emit $\mathfrak { Q }$ 2000 Sirolimus Assay has an assay range of $3 { \cdot } 3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The Abbott IMx Sirolimus Assay has an assay range of $\scriptstyle 0 - 3 0 \ n \ g / \mathfrak { m L }$ .

# Comparison Information

Method comparison studies were conducted at two external sites comparing the Emit® 2000 Sirolimus Assay against LC/MS/MS. Samples from kidney transplant patients were used in the studies. The mean time since transplant was 6.9 years. The data from both sites were pooled, analyzed by linear regression and resulted in the following regression statistics.

<table><tr><td>Comparator</td><td>Slope, ng/mL</td><td>Intercept</td><td>r</td><td>n</td></tr><tr><td>LC/MS/MS</td><td>1.30</td><td>0.054</td><td>0.946</td><td>128</td></tr></table>

# Conclusion

Based on a review of the devices technological features and the method comparison study, the Emit $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2000 Sirolimus Assay, Siro/Tacro Sample Pretreatment Reagent and Sirolimus Calibrators are substantially equivalent to the legally marked devices, the Abbott $\operatorname { I M } \mathbf { x } \mathbb { \textcircled { \mathrm { R } } }$ Sirolimus Assay and Sirolimus Calibrator.

Dear Ms Lewis:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class Ⅱ (Special Controls) or class Ⅲ (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
