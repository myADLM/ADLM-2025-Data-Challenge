Common name: Amphetamine metabolite test system

Classification name: Enzyme Immunoassay, Amphetamine Gas Chromatography, Methamphetamine

Product Code: DKZ, LAF

# Device Description

The Amphetamines II assay is based on the kinetic interaction of microparticles in a solution (KIMS) as measured by changes in light transmission. In the absence of sample drug, soluble drug-polymer conjugates bind to antibody-bound microparticles, causing the formation of particle aggregates. As the aggregation reaction proceeds in the absence of sample, the absorbance increases.

When a urine sample contains the drug in question, this drug competes with the conjugate-bound drug derivative for microparticle-bound antibody. Antibody bound to sample drug is no longer available to promote particle aggregation, and subsequent particle lattice formation is inhibited.

The presence of sample drug diminishes the increasing absorbance in proportion to the concentration of drug in the sample. Sample drug content is determined relative to the value obtained for a known cutoff concentration of drug.

# Intended Use

Amphetamines II (AMPII) is an in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative and semiquantitative detection of amphetamines and methamphetamines on automated clinical chemistry analyzers at cutoff concentrations of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ${ 5 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } }$ and $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ EY when calibrated with $d .$ -methamphetamine. Semiquantitative test results may be obtained that permit laboratories to assess assay performance as part of a quality control program. Semiquantitative assays are intended to determine an appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).

Amphetamines II provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method.' Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.

# Comparison to the Predicate Device

The ONLINE Amphetamines II assay is substantially equivalent to other products in commercial distribution intended for similar use. Most notably, we claim substantial equivalence to the currently marketed Abuscreen ONLINE Amphetamines assay (K983699).

The ONLINE Amphetamines II assay contains an in vitro diagnostic reagent system intended for use on the Roche/Hitachi 917 analyzer for the semi-quantitative and qualitative detection of amphetamines in human urine at cutoff concentrations of 300, 500, and 1000 $\mathfrak { n g / m L }$

The Roche ONLINE Amphetamines II assay utilizes a modified KIMS technology relative to the currently marketed Abuscreen OnLine Amphetamines assay. Differences between this application and the cleared assay include:

1. use of amphetamine and methamphetamine, and monoclonal antibodies attached to microparticles in solution   
2. a soluble drug-polymer conjugate   
3. increased sensitivity to "designer drugs" and their metabolites, and   
4. addition of 300 and ${ 5 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } }$ cutoff concentrations.

The recommended calibrators to be used with the proposed ONLINE Amphetamines II assay are the Preciset DAT Plus I, Preciset DAT Plus II and Cfas DAT Qualitative Plus Calibrators (K060645).

The recommended controls to be used with the proposed ONLINE Amphetamines II assay are the Control Set DAT I, Control Set DAT II, Control Set DAT II (K080183).

Dear Ms. Neff:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
