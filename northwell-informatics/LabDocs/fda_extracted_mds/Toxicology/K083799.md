# 807.92 (a)(4): Device Description

The ARK Topiramate Assay is a homogeneous immunoassay based on competition between drug in the specimen and topiramate epitope labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for binding to the antibody reagent. As the latter binds antibody, enzyme activity decreases. In the presence of drug from the specimen, enzyme activity increases and is directly proportional to the drug concentration. Active enzyme converts the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH that is measured spectrophotometrically as a rate of change in absorbance. Endogenous serum G6PDH does not interfere with the results because the coenyzme NAD functions only with the bacterial enzyme used in the assay.

The ARK Topiramate Assay consists of reagents R1 anti-topiramate polyclonal antibody with substrate and R2 topiramate epitope labeled with bacterial G6PDH enzyme. The ARK Topiramate Calibrator consists of a six-level set to calibrate the assay, and the ARK Topiramate Control consists of a three-level set used for quality control of the assay.

# 807.92 (a)(5): Intended Use / Indications for Use

The ARKTM Topiramate Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay intended for the quantitative determination of topiramate in human serum or plasma on automated clinical chemistry analyzers. The results obtained are used in the diagnosis and treatment of topiramate overdose and in monitoring levels of topiramate to help ensure appropriate therapy.

The ARKTM Topiramate Calibrator is intended for use in calibration of the ARK Topiramate Assay.

The ARKTM Topiramate Control is intended for use in quality control of the ARK Topiramate Assay.

# 807.92 (b)(1) and 807.92 (b)(2): Brief Description of Nonclinical and Clinical Data

# Limit of Quantitation (LOQ)

The LOQ of the ARK Topiramate Assay was determined according to CLSI EP17-A and is defined as the lowest concentration for which acceptable inter-assay precision and recovery is observed (often considered $\leq 2 0 \%$ CV with $\pm 1 5 \%$ recovery). The LOQ was determined to be 1.5 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

# Accuracy

Accuracy (analytical recovery) was performed by adding concentrated topiramate drug into human serum negative for topiramate. A stock concentrate of highly pure topiramate was added volumetrically to human serum negative for topiramate, representing drug concentrations across the assay range. Six replicates of each sample were assayed on an automated clinical chemistry analyzer. The results were averaged and compared to the target concentration and percent recovery calculated. Results are shown below.

# Linearity

Linearity studies were performed as suggested in CLSI/NCCLS Protocol EP6-A. A $6 0 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ serum sample was prepared and dilutions were made proportionally with human serum negative for topiramate. Topiramate concentrations ranged from 0.6 to $6 0 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . Linearity at specific dilutions was considered acceptable if the percent difference was $\pm 1 0 \%$ between the predicted $1 ^ { \mathfrak { s t } }$ and 2nd order regressed values. A linear relationship was demonstrated between 1.2 and 54.0 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . Results are shown below.

# Assay Range

The range of the assay is 1.5 to $5 4 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . Report results below this range as $< 1 . 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ or below the analyzer-specific lower LOQ established in your laboratory. Report results above this range as ${ > } 5 4 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ or above the analyzer-specific upper LOQ established in your laboratory.

# Method Comparison

Correlation studies were performed using CLSI/NCCLS Protocol EP9-A2. Results from the ARK Topiramate assay were compared with results from a commercially available FPIA Immunoassay. The topiramate concentrations ranged from $1 . 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ to $5 3 . 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . Results of the Passing-Bablok regression analysis for the study are shown below.

Correlation Coefficient $( \boldsymbol { \mathbf { r } } ^ { 2 } )$ 0.99   
Number of Samples 113

# Precision

Precision was determined as described in CLSI/NCCLS Protocol EP5-A2. Tri-level controls containing topiramate were used in the study. Each level of control was assayed in quadruplicate twice a day for 20 days. Each of the runs per day was separated by at least two hours. The within run, between day, total SD, and percent CVs were calculated. Results are shown below. Acceptance criteria: ${ < } 1 0 \%$ total CV.

Interference studies were conducted using CLSI/NCCLS Protocol EP7-A2 as a guideline. Clinically high concentrations of the following potentially interfering substances in serum with known levels of topiramate (approximately 5 and $2 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } ,$ were evaluated. Each sample was assayed using the ARK Topiramate Assay, along with a serum control of topiramate. Measurement of topiramate resulted in $\leq 1 0 \%$ error in the presence of interfering substances at the levels tested.

# Metabolites

ARK Topiramate Assay serum and plasma results are unlikely to be affected by metabolism of topiramate drug, since plasma levels of metabolites are usually not clinically significant. The following metabolite was tested for crossreactivity. Measurement of topiramate resulted in $\leq$ $10 \%$ error in the presence of 9-Hydroxy-topiramate at the level tested.

Topiramate-selective antibody did not crossreact with other anti-epileptic or coadministered drugs tested. A high concentration of each compound was spiked into normal human serum with known levels of topiramate (approximately 5 and $2 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } ,$ and assayed along with a serum control of topiramate. Measurement of topiramate resulted in $\leq 1 0 \%$ error in the presence of drug compounds at the levels tested.

# Anticoagulants

Studies were conducted to determine the performance characteristics of the assay for both serum and plasma samples containing topiramate.

The results indicate that there is no significant difference between the recovery of topiramate in serum or plasma.

# On-Board Stability

Calibration Curve Stability:A stored calibration was eective up to 49 days based on supin data.

Reagent on-board stability: Reagents were effective when stored with caps after transfer to analyzer specific reagent containers for up to 60 days based on supporting data.

# 807.92 (b)(3): Conclusions from Nonclinical Testing

As summarized above, the ARK Topiramate Assay, the ARK Topiramate Calibrator and the ARK Topiramate Control are substantially equivalent to the Seradyn ${ \mathrm { Q M S } } ^ { \otimes }$ Topiramate Assay system. The ARK test system was shown to be safe and effective for its intended use based on performance studies.
