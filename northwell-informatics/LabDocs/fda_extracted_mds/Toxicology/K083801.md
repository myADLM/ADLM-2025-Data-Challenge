1. Identification of the Device: Proprietary-Trade Name: Bactrack® Select Breathalyzer (3 models: S30, S50, S70) Classification Name/Product Code: Devices, breath trapping, alcohol, DJZ Common/Usual Name: Breath Alcohol Tester

2. Equivalent legally marketed device: AL-5000 K061922, SENTECH KOREA CORP.

3. Indications for Use (intended use) This device is intended to measure alcohol in human breath. Measurements obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis of alcohol intoxication.

4. Description of the Device: The BACTRACK $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Select Breathalyzer is an alcohol screening device, used for the detection of alcohol in the breath. The BACTRACK $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ provides a digital result, indicating the approximate BAC (Blood Alcohol Content) of the test subject. The BACTRACK $\textcircled{8}$ is powered by two AA batteries (two AAA batteries for model S30) and is very easy to use. The device employs a silicon sensor of the same type commonly used in handheld breathalyzers. The units are factory calibrated but the product should be recalibrated at least every six to twelve months. If the product is used every day, it may need to be recalibrated as frequently as every month.

5. Safety and Effectiveness, comparison to predicate device. The results of bench, test laboratory, and clinical testing indicates that the new device is as safe and effective as the predicate devices.

7. Conclusion. After analyzing bench tests, laboratory tests, a risk analysis, EMC, and clinical testing data, it is the conclusion of KHN Solutions that the BACTRACK $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Select Breathalyzer is as safe and effective as the predicate device, has few technological differences, and has no new indications for use, thus rendering it substantially equivalent to the predicate device. The clinical trial performed showed that the over the counter purchaser of this device could read and understand the instructions, could properly use the device, and obtain results that were comparable to those provided by a professional unit administered by a trained observer.

Dear Mr. Kamm:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
