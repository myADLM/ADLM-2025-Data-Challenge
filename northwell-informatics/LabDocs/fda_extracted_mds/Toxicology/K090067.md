1. Identification of the Device: Proprictary-Trade Name: Bactrack $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Select Breathalyzer Model S80 Classification Name/Product Code: Devices, breath trapping, alcohol, DJZ Common/Usual Name: Breath Alcohol Tester

2. Equivalent legally marketed device: AlcoHAWK PT500 K080848 Q3 Innovations LLC.

3. Indications for Use (intended use) This device is intended to measure alcohol in human breath. Measurements obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis of alcohol intoxication.

4Description of the Device: The BACTRACK $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Select Breathalyzer is an alcohol screening device, used for the detection of alcohol in the breath. The BACTRACK $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ provides a digital result, indicating the approximate BAC (Blood Alcohol Content) of the test subject. The BACTRACK $\textcircled{1}$ is powered by two AA batteries and is very easy to use. The device employs a fuel cell sensor of the same type commonly used in evidentiary breathalyzers. This results in generally better accuracy and longer battery life than silicon sensor units. The units are factory calibrated but the product should be recalibrated at least evcry six to twelve months. If the product is used every day, it may need to be recalibrated as frequently as every month.

5. Safety and Effectiveness, comparison to predicate device. The results of bench, test laboratory, and clinical testing indicates that the new device is as safe and effective as the predicate devices.

Dear Mr. Kamm:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
