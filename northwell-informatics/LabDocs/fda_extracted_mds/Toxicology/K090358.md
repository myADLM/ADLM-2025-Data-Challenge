# Legally marketed device to which equivalency is claimed:

AxSYM Valproic Acid (K941615)

# Intended Use of Device:

The ARCHITECT iValproic Acid assay is an in vitro chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMlA) for the quantitative measurement of valproic acid, an anticonvulsant drug, in human serum or plasma on the ARCHITECT i System with STAT protocol capability. The measurements obtained are used in mvles p.

# Description of Device:

The ARCHITECT iValproic Acid assay is a one-step STAT immunoassay for the quantitative measurement of valproic acid in human serum or plasma using CMIA technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex. Sample, antivalproic acid coated paramagnetic microparticles, and valproic acid acridiniumlabeled conjugate are combincd to create a reaction mixture. The anti-valproic acid coated microparticles bind to valproic acid present in the sample and to the valproic acid acridinium-labeled conjugate. After washing, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is mcasured as relative light units (RLUs). An indirect relationship exists between the amount of valproic acid in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT i System optics.

# Comparison of Technological Characteristics:

The ARCHITECT /Valproic Acid assay utilizes Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA) technology for the quantitative measurement of valproic acid, an anticonvulsant drug, in human serum and plasma. The AxSYM Valproic Acid assay utilizes Fluorescence Polarization Immunoassay (FPlA) technology for the quantitative measurement of valproic acid, an anticonvulsant drug, in serum or plasma.

# Summary of Non-Clinical Performance:

The ARCHITECT iValproic Acid assay is substantially equivalent to the AxSYM Valproic Acid assay in terms of precision, linearity, and interferences as demonstrated in non-clinical performance data in this 510(k) submission.

# Summary of Clinical Performance:

The ARCHITECT iValproic Acid assay demonstrated substantially equivalent performance to the AxSYM Valproic Acid assay with a correlation coefficient of 0.986.

Dear Ms. Wallach:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
