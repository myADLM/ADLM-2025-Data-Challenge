# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

The sponsor references the following guidance document in their submission:

CLSI Guidance EP-12A User Protocol for the Evaluation of Qualitative Test Performance.

# L. Test Principle:

The PROFILE $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ -V MEDTOXScan $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Drugs of Abuse Test System includes a competitive, membrane-based immunochromatographic PROFILE $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ -V MEDTOXScan $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Test Device and the MEDTOXScan $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Reader.

Antibody-Colloidal Gold: Mouse monoclonal antibodies bind to the drug being tested.

Drug-Conjugates: Each drug to be tested was individually conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) or IgG. Each drug conjugate is immobilized on a test line at a designated position on the membrane strip.

Control Line: Each test strip has anti-mouse antibody immobilized at the Control (C) position of the membrane strip. The anti-mouse antibody will bind excess antibodycolloidal gold, indicating that the reagents are migrating properly. When the urine sample is placed in the sample well of a test strip, the dried antibody-colloidal gold under the sample pad dissolves and the urine wicks up the white strips carrying the reddish-purple antibody-colloidal gold with it.

Negative Samples

When no drug(s) is present in the urine sample, the reddish purple antibody-colloidal gold solutions migrate along the strip and bind to the respective drug conjugate(s) immobilized on the membrane. Each strip has up to 4 drug test lines labeled T1 – T4. The binding of the antibody-colloidal gold to the drug conjugate generates a line at the corresponding test (T) position on the strip. The MEDTOXScan $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Reader will scan each test position and if a line is detected it will return “NEG” on the display screen (or print out) next to the abbreviation for the drug test, indicating a negative result.

Positive Samples

When drug(s) is present in the urine sample the antibody-colloidal gold binds to the drug(s) before it migrates along the strip. When the antibody colloidal gold binds to the drug(s) in the urine, it cannot bind to the drug conjugate immobilized on the membrane and no line is generated at the drug specific position in the result window. The MEDTOXScan $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Reader will scan each test position and if no line is detected it will return “POS” on the display screen (or print out) next to the abbreviation for the drug test, indicating a preliminary positive result.

Control Line (Valid or Invalid results) Each test strip has an internal procedural control. A line must form at the Control (C)

position in the result window to indicate that sufficient sample was applied and that the reagents are migrating properly. If a Control line does not form, the test is invalid. The MEDTOXScan $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Reader scans each control line and returns “VALID” to the right of the drug test result to confirm that the control line was detected. If no control line is detected it will return “INVALID” on the display screen next to the abbreviation for the invalid drug test, and no result will be given for the drug test.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Urine stock solutions were prepared for each of the test compounds by spiking standard solution of known concentrations into a commercially available negative pool of urine (pH range of 6-7 and Specific Gravity range of 1.012 - 1.018). Each stock solution was assayed by GC/MS or LC/MS/MS. The $1 5 0 \%$ cutoff sample was serially diluted to form the next lower level in the study. The prepared diluted samples were re-checked additionally by GC/MS or LC/MS/MS to confirm concentrations. A total of 45 results (3 readers x 3 aliquots for 5 days) were obtained for each level.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable. This assay is intended for qualitative use.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Profile V quality control materials were previously cleared and are sold separately. The sponsor specifies the quality control product in the “materials required but not provided” section of the labeling.

No calibrators are required. The device is calibrated during the manufacturing process.

# d. Detection limit:

Sensitivity of qualitative assays may be characterized by validating performance around the claimed cutoff concentration of the assay, and demonstrating the lowest concentration of drug that is capable of or consistently producing a positive result. This information appears in the precision section, 1.a., above.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Cross-reactivity was established by spiking various concentrations of similarly structured drug compounds into drug-free urine. The tables below summarize the results of cross-reactivity studies using various common and structurally similar compounds. Results are expressed as a minimum concentration of metabolite or compound required to produce a response approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay. (or, if no cross-reactivity was observed, then “none detected” is reported).

Non Cross-reactive endogenous compounds

The following compounds were evaluated for reactivity with the Profile V device at $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { u g / m L }$ (albumin was evaluated at $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ and bilirubin was evaluated at $2 0 0 \mathrm { u g / m L }$ ). Samples were evaluated in triplicate by in-house operators. The listed compounds gave negative results with the Profile V device.

Acetaldehyde Creatinine Hemoglobin, Human Acetone Epinephrine Sodium Chloride Albumin, Human b-Estradiol Tetrahydrocortisone Bilirubin Estriol d, 1-Thyroxine Cholesterol Glucose Std. Uric Acid

Unrelated Compounds, Prescription and Over-the-counter Medication

Common compounds were evaluated for reactivity at $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { u g / m L }$ . Samples were evaluated in triplicate by in-house operators and the list of compounds evaluated appears in the package insert.

# Common Drugs

Drug free urine samples were spiked with the Profile V targeted drugs to the concentrations of $50 \%$ and $12 5 \%$ of the cutoff concentrations. $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { u g / m L } }$ of the common drugs listed below, were then added to the preparation and assayed. Evaluations were performed in triplicate by in-house operators. None of the common drugs listed in the following table affected the expected results.

Acetylsalicylic Acid Chlorpheniramine Morphine-OXY Acetaminophen Cocaine Phenobarbital Brompheniramine Maleate Dextromethorphan Phenytoin Caffeine Doxylamine d-Pseudoephedrine Carbamazepine Ibuprofen Salicylic Acid

There is the possibility that other substances and/or factors not listed above may interfere with the test and cause false results.

pH and Specific Gravity:

To test for possible positive and/or negative interference from $\mathsf { p H }$ , the sponsor prepared two study control samples. The control samples consisted of drug free urine spiked with the calibrator drugs at $50 \%$ and $12 5 \%$ of the chosen cutoffs.

Aliquots of the control samples and samples with no drug present were adjusted to a pH of 4.0, 7.0, and 9.0. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. No negative interference due to pH was observed.

To test for possible positive and/or negative interference from specific gravity the sponsor, prepared two study control samples. The control samples consisted of drug free urine spiked with the calibrator drugs at negative and positive concentrations. Aliquots of the control samples were altered to span the specific gravity range of 1.003 to 1.030. No positive or negative interference due to specific gravity was observed.

Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff concentration appears in the precision section, 1.a, above.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device

Performance was evaluated by assaying a panel of blind coded unaltered clinical urine samples containing varying concentrations of drugs with the Profile V device. In-house results (obtained at 10 minutes) were then compared to GC/MS or LC/MS/MS results. Study results are reported in the table below. –
