The tests are intended for over-the-counter (OTC) consumer use as the first step in a two step process to provide consumers, including but not limited to concerned parents, with information concerning the presence or absence of the above stated drugs or their metabolites in a urine sample. Information regarding confirmatory test in the second step of the two-step process, is provided in the package labeling.

The tests will yield preliminary positive results when the prescription drugs Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines, Oxycodone, Tricyclic Antidepressants are ingested, even at or above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly recognized drug levels for Barbiturate, Benzodiazepines, Oxycodone, Tricyclic Antidepressant in urine. The tests provide only preliminary test results, which should be confirmed by other methods such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Clinical considerations and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated. The tests are not intended to be used in monitoring the drug levels.

For Over-The-Counter (OTC) use For In Vitro Diagnostics only

# Comparison to Predicate Devices:

When compared to the predicates, UCP Home Drug Screening Tests provide the qualitative determination of the same drugs in the same matrix, and utilizes the same cutoff concentrations. Both tests are immunochromatographic, lateral flow assays for the qualitative detection of drugs with visual, qualitative end results. Both tests are intended to provide preliminary analytical test results. The predicates are intended for professional use only, whereas UCP Home Drug Screening Tests are intended for OTC consumers use.

# Consumer Studies

The consumer study for UCP Home Drug Screening Test Cards was conducted among 115 lay persons in three geographic regions: Texas, Pennsylvania and California. Fifty eight females and fifty seven males from ages between 18 and 75 years have participated the studies. Fifty eight participants had high school education or less, fifty seven participants had finished college courses. None of the participants had experiences using drug testing products before. A separately consumer study for UCP Home Drug Screening Test Cups was conducted among 110 lay persons in three geographic regions: Texas, Pennsylvania and California. Fifty five females and fifty five males from ages between 18 and 77 years participated the study. Fifty five participants had high school education or less, fifty five participants had finished college courses. None of the participants had experiences using drug testing products before. The urine samples were prepared to contain strong negative ( $0 \%$ of cutoff), a very weak negative $50 \%$ of cutoff), a weak negative $7 5 \%$ of cutoff), a very weak positive ( $12 5 \%$ of cutoff), a weak positive $1 5 0 \%$ of cutoff) and high positive $( 3 0 0 \%$ of Cutoff). The urine samples with various drug concentrations were prepared by spiking pure drugs or drug metabolites into drug free human urine, the final drug concentrations in each urine sample were confirmed by GC/MS but TCA, TCA concentrations in the urine samples was confirmed by HPLC. The test results performed by the lay users showed $9 6 . 7 \%$ or above agreement rate with GC/MS results and indicate the lay users can perform UCP Home Drug Screening Test Card or Cup satisfactorily by following the test instruction. The post-study survey was conducted to determine if the lay users can understand the test instruction, the meaning of the test results and how to interpret the test results. Consumers were asked 9 questions including whether the test was easy to run, the results was easy to read, how to interpret the test results, importance of confirmatory test and some medicines and foods may affect the test results. Participant responses support that the lay users can understand how to run the test, interpret the test results, the importance of confirmatory test, and some issues concerning certain prescription medicines and foods may affect the test results.

The tests contain two formats: 1) Test Card; 2) Test Cup. The test configuration comes with single drug screening test or any combinations of multiple drug screening tests. The test is intended for over-the-counter (OTC) users as the first step in a two step process to provide consumers, including but not limited to concerned parents, with information concerning the presence or absence of the above stated drugs or their metabolites in a urine sample. Information regarding confirmatory testing - the second step in the process, along with the materials for shipping the urine specimen to the laboratory, is provided. The test is also intended for health care professional users.

The tests will yield preliminary positive results when the prescription drugs Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines, Oxycodone, Tricyclic Antidepressants are ingested, even at or above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly recognized drug levels for Barbiturate, Benzodiazepines, Oxycodone, Tricyclic Antidepressant in urine. The tests only provide a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Gc/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method for most drugs (HPLC is the preferred confirmatory method for Tri-cyclic Antidepressants). Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated. The tests are not intended to be used in monitoring drug levels.
