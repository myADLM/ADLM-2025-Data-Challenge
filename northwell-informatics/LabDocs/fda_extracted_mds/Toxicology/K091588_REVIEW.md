The tests contain two formats: 1) Test Card; 2) Test Cup. The test configuration comes with single drug screening test or any combinations of multiple drug screening tests. The test is intended for over-the-counter (OTC) users as the first step in a two step process to provide consumers, including but not limited to concerned parents, with information concerning the presence or absence of the above stated drugs or their metabolites in a urine sample. Information regarding confirmatory testing – the second step in the process, along with the materials for shipping the urine specimen to the laboratory, is provided. The test is also intended for health care professional users.

The tests will yield preliminary positive results when the prescription drugs Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines, Oxycodone, Tricyclic Antidepressants are ingested, even at or above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly recognized drug levels for Barbiturate, Benzodiazepines, Oxycodone, Tricyclic Antidepressant in urine. The tests provide only preliminary data, which should be confirmed by other methods such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Clinical considerations and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test results, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated. The tests are not intended to be used in monitoring drug levels.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For over-the-counter use and health care professional users

4. Special instrument requirements: None

# I. Device Description:

The UCP Home Drug Screening Test Card is capable of measuring 10 of the 13 drugs listed in the intended use at a time. The test cards contain up 10 strips (each strip can hold one drug), five strips on one side of the card and 5 strips on the back side of the card. The UCP Home Drug Screening Test Cup can contain up to five strips that are capable of measuring one drug per strip. Both formats include user instructions, collection cups, transportation bag with absorbent pad, mailing box and identification labels with personal identification number to be used when sending positive urine specimens to the laboratory for confirmation.

# J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

1. Predicate device name(s): UCP Rapid Drug Screening Tests UCP Multiple Drug Screen Test Cups

2. Predicate K number(s):

k050540   
k072062

3. Comparison with predicate:

This device is the exact same device as the predicate device. This device has the same drugs, cutoffs and same matrix.

This device differs from the predicate in that it is intended to be used over-thecounter and prescription use whereas the predicates are for prescription use only.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced.

# L. Test Principle:

The UCP Home™ Drug Screening Tests and Cups employ lateral flow immunochromatographic technology based on the principle of competitive binding. Drugs, if present in concentrations below the cutoff level, will not saturate the binding sites of antibody coated particles in the device. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-specific conjugate and a colored line will appear in the test line region. The colored line will not form if the sample contains drug in excess of the cutoff level because the drug will saturate all the binding sites of the drug-specific antibody. Each strip in the device contains a procedural control that appears in the control line region indicating that the sample has migrated properly on the test strip.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

This submission is for an OTC claim. Performance characteristics for each of the drugs are found in the following 510(k) numbers: k050540 (amphetamine, cocaine, methamphetamine, MDMA, opiates, phencyclidine, THC, benzodiazepine, methadone, barbiturates oxycodone) and k061457 (tricyclics

antidepressants).

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

See k050540 (amphetamine, cocaine, methamphetamine, MDMA, opiates, phencyclidine, THC, benzodiazepine, methadone, barbiturates oxycodone) and k061457 (tricyclics antidepressants).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

This device has internal process controls. Each strip in the device contains a procedural control that appears in the control line region indicating that the sample has migrated properly on the test strip. The sponsor informs the user not to interpret the test if a colored line failed to appear in the control region. External controls are not supplied with this device.

The sponsor conducted an incremental time study to support the devices claimed read time of 5 to 10 minutes. Concentrations of amphetamine, cocaine, methamphetamine, MDMA, opiates, phencyclidine, THC, benzodiazepine, methadone, barbiturates oxycodone and tricyclics antidepressants were prepared at $+ / - 5 0 \%$ and $+ / - 2 5 \%$ of the cutoffs. Twenty determinations were read at each cutoff concentration at 5, 7 and 10 minute intervals. The results supported the sponsors read time of 5 to 10 minutes for the test card and cup.

# d. Detection limit:

See k050540 (amphetamine, cocaine, methamphetamine, MDMA, opiates, phencyclidine, THC, benzodiazepine, methadone, barbiturates oxycodone) and k061457 (tricyclic antidepressants).

e. Analytical specificity:

See k050540 (amphetamine, cocaine, methamphetamine, MDMA, opiates, phencyclidine, THC, benzodiazepine, methadone, barbiturates oxycodone) and k061457 (tricyclics antidepressants).

f. Assay cut-off:

See k050540 (amphetamine, cocaine, methamphetamine, MDMA, opiates, phencyclidine, THC, benzodiazepine, methadone, barbiturates oxycodone) and k061457 (tricyclics antidepressants).

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Test Cards:

The sponsor conducted a lay user study for test cards with 115 lay persons in three locations: Texas, Pennsylvania and California. Fifty-eight females and fifty-seven males from ages of 18 to 75 years of age participated in the study. Fifty-eight participants had a high school education or less, fifty-seven participants had completed college courses. None of the participants had experience with a point of care drug testing product.

Test Cups:

The sponsor conducted a lay user study for test cups with 110 lay persons in three locations: Texas, Pennsylvania and California. Fifty-five females and fifty-five males from ages of 18 to 75 years of age participated in the study. Fifty-five participants had a high school education or less, fifty seven participants had completed college courses. None of the participants had experience with a point of care drug testing product.

Quality control samples for test cards and cups were prepared to contain a strong negative ( $0 \%$ of the cutoff), a very weak negative ( $50 \%$ of cutoff), a weak negative ( $7 5 \%$ of cutoff), a weak positive ( $12 5 \%$ of cutoff), a strong positive ( $1 5 0 \%$ of cutoff) and a very strong positive $300 \%$ of the cutoff) of each drug. The quality control specimens were prepared at concentrations shown below. Pure drug or metabolite was spiked into drug free human urine. All specimens (except TCA samples) were verified by GC/MS. TCA samples were verified by HPLC. In the drug test card study, 4 users tested three samples, 10 users tested five samples, 96 users tested four samples and 5 users tested one two samples. There were 456 total observations. In the drug test cup study, 3 users tested six samples, 96 users tested four samples, 9 users tested five samples, 1 user tested two samples and 1 user tested seven samples. There were 456 observations.
