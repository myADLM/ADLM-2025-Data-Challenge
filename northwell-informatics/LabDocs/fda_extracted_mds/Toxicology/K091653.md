# 807.92 (a)(4): Device Description

The ARK Levetiracetam Assay is a homogeneous immunoassay based on competition between drug in the specimen and levetiracetam labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for binding to the antibody reagent. As the latter binds antibody, enzyme activity decreases. In the presence of drug from the specimen, enzyme activity increases and is directly proportional to the drug concentration. Active enzyme converts the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH that is measured spectrophotometrically as a rate of change in absorbance. Endogenous serum G6PDH does not interfere with the results because the coenyzme NAD functions only with the bacterial enzyme used in the assay.

The ARK Levetiracetam Assay consists of reagents R1 anti-levetiracetam polyclonal antibody with substrate and R2 levetiracetam labeled with bacterial G6PDH enzyme. The ARK Levetiracetam Calibrator consists of a six-level set to calibrate the assay, and the ARK Levetietam Control consits oa three-evel t used or quality control o te assy.

# 807.92 (a)(5): Intended Use / Indications for Use

The ARKTm Levetiracetam Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay intended for the quantitative determination of levetiracetam in human serum or plasma on automated clinical chemistry analyzers. Levetiracetam concentrations can be used as an aid in management of patients treated with levetiracetam.

The ARK™m Levetiracetam Calibrator is intended for use in calibration of the ARK Levetiraçetam Assay.

The ARK TM Levetiracetam Control is intended for use in quality control of the ARK Levetiracetam Assay.

# 807.92 (b)(1) and 807.92 (b)(2): Brief Description of Nonclinical and Clinical Data

Limit of Quantilation (LOQ)

The LOQ of the ARK Levetiracetam Assay was determined according to CLSI EP17-A and is defined as the lowest concentration for which acceptable inter-assay precision and recovery is observed $( \leq 2 0 \%$ CV with $\pm 1 5 \%$ recovery). The LOQ was determined to be $2 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

# Accuracy

Accuracy (analytical recovery) was performed by adding concentrated levetiracetam drug into human serum negative for levetiracetam. A stock concentrate of highly pure levetiracetam was added volumetrically to human serum negative for levetiracetam, representing drug concentrations across the assay range. Six replicates of each sample were assayed on an automated clinical chemistry analyzer. The results were averaged and compared to the target concentration and percent recovery calculated. Results are shown below.

# Linearity

Linearity studies were performed as suggested in CLSI/NCCLS Protocol EP6-A. A $1 0 0 . 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ EY serum sample was prepared and dilutions were made proportionally with human serum negative for levetiracetam. Levetiracetam concentrations ranged from 1.0 to $1 0 0 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . Linearity at specific dilutions was considered acceptable if the percent difference was $\pm 1 0 \%$ between the predicted 1" and 2nd order regressed values or $\pm 1 5 \%$ below $3 . 0 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m L }$ A linear relationship was demonstrated between 2.0 and $1 0 0 . 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ .Results are shown below.

# Assay Range

The range of the assay is 2.0 to $1 0 0 . 0 \cdot \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m L }$ .Report results below this range as $< 2 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ or below the analyzer-specific lower LOQ established in your laboratory. Report results above this range $\mathtt { a s } > 1 0 0 . 0 \ \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m L }$ or above the analyzer-specific upper LOQ established in your laboratory.

Specimens testing initially above the assay range may be diluted in Calibrator A and retested. Multiply the assay result by the dilution factor to obtain the concentration of levetiracetam in the undiluted specimen.

# Method Comparison

Correlation studies were performed using CLSI/NCCLS Protocol EP9-A2. Results from the ARK Levetiracetam assay were compared with results from a reference LC/MS/MS method. The levetiracetam concentrations ranged from $2 . 0 ^ { \cdot } \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m L }$ to $8 6 . 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . Results of the PassingBablok regression analysis for the study are shown below (with $9 5 \%$ confidence limits).
