# Product Names:

One Step EDDP (Methadone Metabolite) Test Strip

# Common Name:

Immunochromatographic Test for the 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP) in urine

# Regulation Name:

Methadone Test System

# Product Code:

DJR

Regulatory Class:

Class II

Classification Regulation: 21 CFR 862.3620

# Intended Use

The One Step EDDP (Methadone Metabolite) Test Strip is a rapid immunochromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of 2-ethylidene-1,5- dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), an inactive metabolite of methadone, at a designated cutoff concentration of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . This product is used to obtain a visual, qualitative result and is intended for professional use and professionals at point of care sites.

This assay provides only a preliminary result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method.

Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.

# Description:

The One Step EDDP (Methadone Metabolite) Test is an immunoassay based on the principle of competitive binding. Drugs which may be present in the urine specimen compete against the drug conjugate for binding sites on the antibody. During testing, a urine specimen migrates upward by capillary action. EDDP, if present in the urine specimen below $3 0 0 \mathrm { \ n g / m L }$ , will not saturate .the binding sites of antibody-coated particles in the test. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized EDDP conjugate and a visible colored line will show up in the test line region. The colored line will not form in the test line region if the EDDP level exceeds $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ EY because it will saturate all the binding sites of anti-EDDP antibodies. A drug-positive urine specimen will not generate a colored line in the test line region because of drug competition, while a drug-negative urine specimen or a specimen containing a drug concentration less than the cut-off will generate a line in the test line region. To serve as a procedural control, a colored line will always appear at the control line region. This confirms sufficient specimen volume, adequate membrane wicking and correct

# Comparison to a Predicate Device:

The predicate devices, ACON MTD One Step Methadone Test Strip and ACON MTD One Step Methadone Test Device (K012595) are intended for the detection of Methadone in urine with a cutoff of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . The One Step EDDP (Methadone Metabolite) Test Strip is to be used for the detection of the Methadone Metabolite EDDP at a cutoff of 300 $\mathfrak { n g / m L }$ . The same test principle and technology of these rapid diagnostic tests enables substantial equivalence. Another predicate device, the DRI Methadone Metabolite Enzyme Assay (K023617), is a Liquid Homogeneous Enzyme Assay which detects EDDP with results being obtained spectrophotometrically. Although the test principle differs, the same metabolite is to be detected at the same cut-off $( 3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ as does the One Step EDDP (Methadone Metabolite) Test Strip. Therefore, the DRI Methadone Metabolite Enzyme Assay is also used in the substantial equivalence discussion.

A predicate device with identical technology is K081378 -Bionexia™M Single and MultiStrip Cassette/Dipstick DOA Screen Panels., which are rapid immunochromatographic immunoassays for the qualitative detection of 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3- diphenylpyrrolidine with a cutoff of $1 0 0 n \mathrm { { g / m L } }$ (EDDP) (and other drugs). The submitter is Applied DNA Technologies Inc. BioClinical Performance Data of the One Step EDDP (Methadone Metabolite) Test Strip was compared with the reference method GC/MS and the DRI $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Methadone Metabolite Assay (cutoff $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { \& / m L }$ manufactured by Microgenics, Inc.

# Performance Characteristics

The One Step EDDP (Methadone Metabolite) Test Strip was evaluated to determine the performance characteristics of the test. Various studies were performed to determine the Analytical Sensitivity, Cross Reactivity, Interference Substances, Urinary $\mathfrak { p H }$ Urinary Specific Gravity, Reading Time Flexibility, Sample Flexibility, Temperature Flexibility, Specimen Storage, Recovery, Stability, POL Study and Clinical Study.

# Accuracy

The performance of the One Step EDDP (Methadone Metabolite) Test Strip was evaluated and compared to GC/MS by three external clinical study sites, with 3 different employees performing the testing.
