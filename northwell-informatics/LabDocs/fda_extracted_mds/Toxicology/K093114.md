# DEVICE NAME

Trade Name: Thermo Scientific DRI ® Amphetamines Assay Common Name: DRI ® Amphetamines Assay

Device Classification: Amphetamine test system, Methamphetamine Test System

Regulation number: 21 CFR 862.3100, 21 CFR 862.3610

Product Code: DKZ, LAF

# INTENDED USE

The DRl" Amphetamines Assay is intended for the qualitative or semi-quantitative determination of amphetamine and methamphetamine in human urine. The assay has cutoff levels of 500 and 1000 ng/mL. The assay provides a simple and rapid analytical screening procedure for detecting amphetamine and methamphetamine in urine on automated clinical analyzers. The assay is calibrated with methamphetamine.

This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.

# SUBSTANTIALLY EQUIVILANT PREDICATE DEVICE

Thermo Scientific $D \mathsf { R } \mathsf { I } ^ { \otimes }$ Amphetamines Assay is substantially equivalent to the previously cleared CEDIA® DAU Amphetamines Assay (k943993).

# SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION OF THE TEST

Amphetamines are synthetic derivatives of ephedrine. The most common amphetamines include d-amphetamine, d-methamphetamine, and d, 1-amphetamine. They act as stimulants for the central nervous system. Amphetamine is the most sympathomimetic amine. When amphetamine is ingested, it is either

rapidly deactivated in the liver or excreted unchanged into the urine. Other ephedrine derivatives such as methamphetamine can be metabolized and excreted in urine as amphetamine.

The DRl Amphetamines Assay is a liquid ready-to-use homogeneous enzyme immunoassay. The assay uses specific antibodies, which can detect amphetamine and/or methamphetamine in urine with minimal cross-reactivity to various over-the-counter structurally unrelated compounds. The assay is based on the competition of an enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) labeled drug and the drug from the urine sample for a fixed amount of specific antibody binding sites. In the absence of free drug from the sample, the specific antibody binds the drug labeled with G6PDH and causes a decrease in enzyme activity. In the presence of free drug, the free drug occupies the antibody binding sites, allowing the drug-labeled G6PDH to interact with the substrate, resulting in enzyme activity. This phenomenon creates a direct relationship between drug concentration in urine and the enzyme activity. The enzyme activity is determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm by measuring its ability to convert nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH.

# PERFORMANCE TESTING SUMMARY

# Precision and Accuracy

Samples spiked with d-amphetamine and d-methamphetamine were tested for precision in qualitative and semi-quantitative assays following a randomized CLSI protocol. The precision study met the design specifications in both the qualitative and semi-quantitative assays. In the qualitative study, all negative samples recovered as negative and all positive samples recovered as positive. In the semi-quantitative study, the within run $\% 0 v$ for was less than or equal to $6 . 2 \%$ EPY and the total run $\% 0 v$ was less than or equal to $6 . 9 \%$ .

# Method Comparison

Samples were tested by DRI qualitative and semi-quantitative assay and compared to GC/MS. The method comparison exhibited results greater than $96 \%$ total agreement between the DRI methods and GC/MS for both qualitative and semi-quantitative assays. Discordant results were obtained when the assay was used to detect amphetamine and methamphetamine analytes individually. The assay detects the presence of both amphetamine and methamphetamine analytes with $100 \%$ cross reactivity to both drugs. Therefore samples tested for one analyte may appear discordant due to the presence of the other analyte.

The method comparison results meet the design input specifications.

# Dilution Recovery

Samples were tested to demonstrate linearity throughout the assay range. Results showed that recovery was less than $\pm 4 \%$ error of the expected value for levels tested from 0 to $2 0 0 0 \ n g / m L$ . The results met the design input specification for levels tested throughout the assay range, and the assay dilutes in a linear fashion.

# On-Board Open Vial reagent Stability

Uncapped reagents were stored in an analyzer and all calibrators and controls were tested in qualitative and semi-quantitative assay. Reagents stored on the analyzer are stable for a minimum of 60 days.

# CONCLUSION

As summarized, the Thermo Scientific $D \mathsf { R } \mathsf { I } ^ { \otimes }$ Amphetamines Assay is substantially equivalent to the $C E D \mathsf { I A } ^ { \otimes }$ Amphetamines Assay. Substantial equivalence has been demonstrated through performance testing to verify that the device functions as intended and that design specifications have been satisfied.
