# Predicate Device:

BreathScan Alcohol Detector   
Akers Biosciences Inc., Thorofare, New Jersey, USA 08086. 510(k) Number: K060761

# Description:

The Breath Alcohol Detector is a visual semi-quantitative test for the detection of alcohol in the exhaled breath. The Breath Alcohol Detector consists of a plastic tube, two plastic plugs, a blow bag (optional), a tube label and a glass vial encased with reaction crystals. The crystals employ a solid-phase chemistry system based on chemically chromogenic reaction. Alcohol, if present in the exhaled breath, reacts with the chemically coated crystals and produces a color change. This color change is proportional to the concentration of alcohol in the breath, which is an approximation of relative Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC). The Breath Alcohol Detector is available with or without blow bags in six cut-off levels: $0 . 0 2 \%$ $0 . 0 4 \%$ , $0 . 0 5 \%$ , $0 . 0 6 \%$ , $0 . 0 8 \%$ or $0 . 1 0 \%$ cut-off levels.

# Intended Use:

The Breath Alcohol Detector is for the semi-quantitative rapid detection of the presence of alcohol in the exhaled breath. The Breath Alcohol Detector indicates relative Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) at $0 . 0 2 \%$ $0 . 0 4 \%$ , $0 . 0 5 \%$ , $0 . 0 6 \%$ , $0 . 0 8 \%$ or $0 . 1 0 \%$ cut-off levels.

# Discussion of Non-Clinical Tests Performed for Determination of Substantial Equivalence are as follows:

Guidance documents included the "NHTSA/DOT Highway Safety Programs; Model Specifications for Screening Devices to Measure Alcohol in Bodily Fluids, (Federal Register/Vol.59, No.147, August 2, 1994/Notices/39382)," and NHTSA/DOT Highway Safety Programs; Model Specifications for Screening Devices to Measure Alcohol in Bodily Fluids, (Federal Register/Vol.73, No.62, March 3, 2008/Notices)"

# Laboratory Testing:

The performance characteristics of the Mission® Breath Alcohol Detector were evaluated by the following studies: precision, analytical specificity-blank reading, analytical specificity-cigarette smoke, analytical specificity-volatile substances, temperature flexibility, vibration effect, lighting effect and device comparison study.

# Discussion of Clinical Tests Performed:

Clinical studies were conducted with laypersons and trained laboratory technicians using the Mission® Breath Alcohol Detector. The study data were presented evaluating the accuracy of the Mission® Breath Alcohol Detector compared to an evidentiary breath test, Alco-Sensor IV, manufactured by Intoximeters Inc. which is a DOT/NHTSA approved device (Conforming Product List of Evidential Breath Alcohol Measurement Devices  FR/Vol 72, No 241/December 2007), per the ACON Clinical Study Protocol for the Breath Alcohol Detector. Study results indicate that nonprofessional, inexperienced laypersons were able to obtain comparable readings when using the Mission® Breath Alcohol Detector as compared to the results obtained by the trained technicians. In addition, the participating laypersons were questioned and responded as satisfied with the ease of operation by following the Instructions for Use and the overall performance of the Mission® Breath Alcohol Detector.

# Conclusion:

The laboratory testing and clinical study results demonstrate that the Mission Breath Alcohol Detector is safe, accurate and easy-to-use. It also demonstrates that the Mission® Breath Alcohol Detector is substantially equivalent to the Akers Biosciences BreathScan Alcohol Detector, currently sold on the U.S. market.
