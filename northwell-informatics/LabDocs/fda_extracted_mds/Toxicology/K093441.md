# G. Device Description: Method

The DIGXN method is a homogeneous, sequential, chemiluminescent immunoassay based on ${ \mathsf { L O C l @ } }$ technology. The $\mathsf { L O C l @ }$ reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and a biotinylated $F ( \mathsf { a b } ) _ { 2 }$ fragment of an anti-Digoxin mouse monoclonal antibody. The first bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with ouabain, a weaker binding analog of digoxin, and contains a photosensitizer dye. In a first step, sample is incubated with biotinylated $F ( \mathsf { a b } ^ { \prime } ) _ { 2 }$ which allows digoxin from the sample to saturate a fraction of the biotinylated $F ( \mathsf { a b } ) _ { 2 }$ that is directly related to the digoxin concentration. In a second step, ouabain chemibeads are added and form bead/biotinylated $F ( \mathsf { a b } ^ { \prime } ) _ { 2 }$ immunocomplexes with the non-saturated fraction of the biotinylated $F ( \mathsf { a b } ^ { \prime } ) _ { 2 }$ . Sensibeads are then added and bind to the biotin to form bead pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at $6 1 2 \mathsf { n m }$ and is an inverse function of the digoxin concentration in the sample.

# Calibrator

The DRUG 4 Calibrator is a 5 level, liquid calibrator. It is packaged as a kit of ten vials, two vials per level (A, B, C, D and E), $2 . 5 m L$ per vial. The product matrix is human serum.

# H. Intended Use:

# Method

The DIGxN method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of digoxin in human serum and plasma on the Dimension Vista® System. Measurements of digoxin are used in the diagnosis and treatment of digoxin overdose and in monitoring levels of digoxin to help ensure appropriate therapy.

# Calibrator

The DRUG 4 CAL is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of the LOCl Digoxin (DIGXN) method on the Dimension Vista® System.
