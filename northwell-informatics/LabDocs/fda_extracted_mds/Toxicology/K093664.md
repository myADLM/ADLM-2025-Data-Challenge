# Device Name

Proprietary name: Amphetamines II

Common name: Amphetamine metabolite test system

Classification name: Enzyme Immunoassay, Amphetamine Product Code: DKZ

The Amphetamines II test is an immunoassay for use on automated clinical chemistry analyzers. The device consists of two wet reagents; a soluble drug-conjugate, and an antibody-bound microparticle solution. During the assay, in the absence of sample drug in urine, soluble drug-conjugates bind to antibody-bound microparticles, causing the formation of particle aggregates. When a urine sample contains the drug in question, this drug competes with the drug derivative conjugate for microparticle-bound antibody. Antibody bound to sample drug is no longer available to promote particle aggregation, and subsequent particle lattice formation is inhibited. The rate of absorbance change is proportional to the concentration of drug in the sample. Calibrators, ranging in concentration from $0 { - } 5 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ depending on cutoff and test mode, are run with the assay. Concentrations of controls and unknowns are calculated from the standard curve in semi-quantitative mode. Results for controls or calibrators are determined as preliminary positive or negative relative to the cutoff in qualitative mode.

C.f.a.s. DAT Qualitative Clinical, C.f.a.s. DAT Qualitative Plus, C.f.a.s. DAT Qualitative Plus Clinical, Preciset DAT Plus I Calibrators, and Preciset DAT Plus II Calibrators are ready to use, multianalyte calibrators prepared by the quantitative addition of drug or drug metabolite to drug-free human urine.

Control Set DAT I, II, and III, and Control Set DAT Clinical are ready to use multianalyte controls prepared by the quantitative addition of drug or drug metabolite to drug-free urine.

# Intended Use

Amphetamines II (AMPIl) is an in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative and semiquantitative detection of amphetamines and methamphetamines on COBAS INTEGRA systems in human urine at cutoff concentrations of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ when calibrated with $d$ -methamphetamine. Semiquantitative test results may be obtained that permit laboratories to assess assay performance as part of a quality control program. . Semiquantitative assays are intended to determine an appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).

Amphetamines II provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method.² Clinical consideration and professional judgement should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.

# Comparison to the Predicate Device

The ONLINE Amphetamines II assay is substantially equivalent to other products in commercial distribution intended for similar use. Most notably, we claim substantial equivalence to the currently marketed Amphetamines II assay (K083764).

The ONLINE Amphetamines II assay contains an in vitro diagnostic reagent system intended for use on the Roche Integra analyzers for the semi-quantitative and qualitative detection of amphetamines in human urine at cutoff concentrations of 300, 500, and $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

The Roche ONLINE Amphetamines II assay utilizes a modified KIMS technology relative to the currently marketed Abuscreen OnLine Amphetamines assay. Differences between this application and the cleared assay include:

1. use of amphetamine and methamphetamine, and monoclonal antibodies attached to microparticles in solution   
2. a soluble drug-polymer conjugate   
3. increased sensitivity to "designer drugs"and their metabolites, and   
4. addition of 300 and $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ cutoff concentrations.

The recommended calibrators to be used with the proposed ONLINE Amphetamines II assay are the Preciset DAT Plus I, Preciset DAT Plus II and Cfas DAT Qualitative Plus Calibrators (K060645).

The recommended controls to be used with the proposed ONLINE Amphetamines II assay are the Control Set DAT I, Control Set DAT II, Control Set DAT III (K080183).

# Intended use

Amphetamines II (AMPIl) is an in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative and semiquantitative detection of amphetamines and methamphetamines in human urine on COBAS INTEGRA systems at cutoff concentrations of 300 ng/mL, 500 ng/mL and 1000 ng/mL when calibrated with $d$ -methamphetamine. Semiquantitative test results may be obtained that permit laboratories to assess assay performance as part of a quality control program. Semiquantitative assays are intended to determine an appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).

Amphetamines II. provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgement should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.

# Summary

The amphetamines are known as the sympathomimetic amines as they mimic the effects of stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. These small molecules, based on Bphenylethylamine, structurally resemble the bodies own catecholamines. A wide variety have been created via substitutions anywhere on the structure. The amphetamines are potent central nervous stimulants. As such they can increase wakefulness, physical activity, and decrease appetite. The amphetamines have some limited indications and approval for use in ADHD, narcolepsy, and obesity. However, because these CNS stimulants convey a sense of self-confidence, well being. and euphoria, they are highly addictive, widely abused, and consequently controlled substances. Abuse can lead to medical, psychological, and social consequences. Adverse health effects include memory loss, aggression, psychotic behavior, heart damage, malnutrition, and severe dental problems.² Amphetamine may be self-administered either orally or by intravenous injection in amounts of up to $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ daily by tolerant addicts. It is a metabolite of a number of other drugs including methamphetamine. Normally about $30 \%$ is excreted unchanged in the 24 hour urine, but this may change to as much as $7 4 \%$ in acid urine and may decrease to $1 \%$ in alkaline urine.

Amphetamines $\mathbf { I I }$ is calibrated with $d$ -methamphetamine and therefore the sensitivity towards amphetamines is different than $d$ -methamphetamine, as indicated in the "Analytical specificity" section.

# Test principle

The assay is based on the kinetic interaction of microparticles in a solution (KIMS), as measured by changes in light transmission. In the absence of amphetamine or methamphetamine, soluble drug conjugates bind to antibody-bound microparticles, causing the formation of particle aggregates. As the aggregation reaction proceeds in the absence of amphetamine or methamphetamine, the absorbance increases.

When a urine sample contains amphetamine or methamphetamine, this drug competes with the drug derivative conjugate for microparticle-bound antibody. Antibody bound to amphetamine or methamphetamine is no longer available to promote particle aggregation, and subsequent particle lattice formation is inhibited. The presence of amphetamine or methamphetamine diminishes the increasing absorbance in proportion to the concentration of drug in the sample. Amphetamine or methamphetamine content is determined relative to the value obtained for a known cutoff concentration of $d$ -methamphetamine.?

# Specimen collection and preparation

Only the specimens listed below were tested and found acceptable.

Urine: Collect urine samples in clean glass or plastic containers. Fresh urine samples do not require special handling or pretreatment, but an effort should be made to keep pipetted samples free of gross debris. Samples should be within the normal physiological pH range of 5 to 8. No additives or preservatives are required. It is recommended that urine specimens be stored at 2 to ${ \mathfrak { z } } ^ { \circ } { \mathbf { C } }$ and tested within 5 days of collection.\* Centrifuge highly turbid specimens before testing. Adulteration or dilution of the sample can cause erroneous results. If adulteration is suspected, another sample should be collected. Specimen validity testing is required for specimens collected under the Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs.2 Specimens containing human-sourced materials should be handled as if potentially infectious using safe laboratory procedures such as those outlined in Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (HHS Publication Number [CDC] 93-8395).

# Caution

Specimen dilutions should only be used as an estimation for GC/MS and are not intended for patient values. Dilution procedures, when used, should be validated.

# Materials provided

# Semiquantitative result reporting

The semiquantitation of preliminary positive results should only be used by laboratories to determine an appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as GC/MS. It also permits the laboratory to establish quality control procedures and assess control performance.

Note: When using the post-dilution function (1:10 dilution), to ensure the sample was not overdiluted, the diluted result must be at least half the analyte cutoff value times 10. If the diluted result falls below half the analyte cutoff value times 10, repeat the sample with a smaller dilution. A dilution that produces a result closest to the analyte cutoff is the most accurate estimation. To estimate the positive sample's concentration, multiply the result by the appropriate dilution factor. Dilutions should only be used as an estimation for GC/MS.

# Limitations1

See the Analytical specificity section of this method sheet for information on substances tested for cross-reactivity in this assay. There is the possibility that other substances and/or factors may interfere with the test and cause erroneous results (e.g., technical or procedural errors).

A preliminary positive result with this assay indicates the presence of amphetamine or methamphetamine in urine. It does not measure the level of intoxication.

# ACTION REQUIRED

Special wash programming: The use of special wash steps is mandatory when certain test combinations are run together on COBAS INTEGRA 800 analyzer. Refer to the Method Manual, Introduction, Extra Wash Cycles for further instructions.

Where required, special wash/carry-over evasion programming must be implemented prior to reporting results with this test.

# Expected values

No drug should be present in individuals that have not ingested amphetamines.

# Specific performance data

Representative performance data on the COBAS INTEGRA 800 analyzer are given below. Results obtained in individual laboratories may differ.

# Precision

A $d$ methamphetamine (MAMP) solution $( 1 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L } )$ was added to 9 samples obtained from a human urine sample pool to achieve concentrations at approximately $\cdot 1 0 0 \% , - 7 5 \% , - 5 0 \% ,$ - $2 5 \%$ $\begin{array} { r } { \mathrm { ~ ; ~ } + / \mathrm { - ~ } 0 ~ \% , + 2 5 ~ \% , + 5 0 ~ \% , + 7 5 ~ \% } \end{array}$ ,and $+ 1 0 0 \%$ of the cutoff value. These samples were tested for precision in qualitative and semiquantitative modes. Following a CLSI (EP5-A2) precision protocol, samples were tested in 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 21 days, total ${ \bf N } = 8 4$ .

# Accuracy

The accuracy of this assay was determined against $d$ -methamphetamine or $d$ -amphetamine GC/MS results. The evaluated cutoff concentrations for the GC/MS testing were the same as the assay screening cutoffs. For both $d$ -methamphetamine and $d$ -amphetamine, 36 urine samples, obtained from a clinical laboratory were confirmed to be negative by GC/MS and were evaluated with Amphetamines II. $100 \%$ of these normal urines were negative with both the semiquantitative and qualitative assay relative to the ${ 3 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } }$ ${ 5 0 0 } ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ,and $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ cutoffs. 4 additional unaltered samples, containing $d$ -methamphetamine between $8 5 { - } 2 0 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (GC/MS confirmed), were tested with the $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ cutoff and gave negative results.

36 samples obtained from a clinical laboratory, where they screened positive with a commercially available enzyme immunoassay and were subsequently confirmed positive by GC/MS to contain $d$ -methamphetamine or $^ d$ -amphetamine, were evaluated with Amphetamines II. $100 \%$ of these samples were positive relative to the $3 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , ${ 5 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } }$ , and $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ cutoffs.

In addition, several unaltered near cutoff samples were run for each cutoff. These samples fell in the near cutoff negative range (between $\cdot 5 0 \%$ and cutoff) and the near cutoff positive range (between cutoff and $+ 5 0 \%$ . For each cutoff, 4 negative near cutoff samples and 4 positive near cutoff samples were assayed.

Data from the accuracy studies described above were combined with data generated from the unaltered near cutoff urine samples. The following results were obtained with the Amphetamines II assay on the COBAS INTEGRA 800 analyzer relative to the GC/MS values for both $d$ -methamphetamine and $d$ -amphetamine.

# Analytical specificity

The specificity of Amphetamines II, on the COBAS INTEGRA 800 analyzer, for various phenethylamines and structurally similar compounds was determined by generating inhibition curves for each of the compounds listed for both semiquantitative and qualitative modes and determining the approximate quantity of each compound that is equivalent in assay reactivity to the ${ \bf 3 0 0 n g / m L }$ , ${ 5 0 0 } \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ,and $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } ~ \AA$ $d$ -methamphetamine assay cutoff. The tables below show the semiquantitative results of the study for each assay cutoff. The same samples were run in the qualitative mode and all recovered appropriately negative or positive, based on the calculated cross-reactivity.

The same experiment was performed in the semiquantitative mode for each cutoff. All negative and positive controls recovered properly, within $8 0 \% - 1 2 0 \%$ , in the presence of the interfering substance.

An additional protocol was executed in which samples containing either .AMP or MAMP at control levels $( \pm 2 5 \%$ of cutoff) with specific gravities ranging from 1.001 to 1.034 were tested. As with the other interferences, there were no control cross-overs on any of the 3 assay cutoffs at either extreme specific gravity level.

Samples having a $\mathsf { p H }$ ranging from 4.5 to 8.0 and containing either AMP or MAMP at control levels $( \pm \ : 2 5 \ : \%$ of cutoff) were also tested. There were $\leq 5 \ \%$ cross-overs on any of the 3 assay cutoffs.

Any modification of the instrument as set forth in this labeling requires validation by the laboratory.

# Indication for Use

510(k) Number (if known):

K093664

JUL 2 8 2010

Device Name: Amphetamines II Indication For Use:

Amphetamines II (AMPII) is an in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative and semiquantitative detection of amphetamines and methamphetamines in human urine on COBAS INTEGRA systems at cutoff concentrations of ${ 3 0 0 \mathrm { \ n g / m L } }$ , ${ 5 0 0 } ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ when calibrated with $d$ -methamphetamine. Semiquantitative test results may be obtained that permit laboratories to assess assay performance as part of a quality control program. Semiquantitative assays are intended to determine an appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).

Amphetamines II provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method.' Clinical consideration and professional judgement should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.
