# Predicate Device:

QED A150 Saliva Alcohol Test Orasure Technologies Inc., Bethlehem, PA 18018 510(k) Number: K894001

# Description:

The Mission Saliva Alcohol Test Strip is a screening test used to semi-quantitatively measure alcohol in human saliva at $0 . 0 \%$ $0 . 0 2 \%$ $0 . 0 4 \%$ , $0 . 0 8 \%$ , and $0 . 3 0 \%$ Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC). Results are used in the diagnosis of alcohol intoxication. The test is a firm plastic strip with a test pad attached at the tip. The test pad contains chemicals that are highly sensitive to alcohol. Alcohol in saliva reacts with the chemicals to produce a color change on the test pad. The color change depends on the amount of alcohol present. The results are read by comparing the color of the test pad with the color chart. The test gives relative Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) from $0 . 0 2 \%$ to $0 . 3 0 \%$ .

# Intended Use:

The Mission Saliva Alcohol Test Strip is a screening test used to semi-quantitatively measure alcohol in human saliva. The test strip indicates relative Blood Alcohol Concentration at 0.0%, 0.02%, 0.04%, 0.08%, and 0.30% cut-off levels. Results are used in the diagnosis of alcohol intoxication. For in vitro diagnostic use only.

# Discussion of Non-Clinical Tests Performed for Determination of Substantial Equivalence are as follows:

Guidance documents included the "NHTSA/DOT Highway Safety Programs; Model Specifications for Screening Devices to Measure Alcohol in Bodily Fluids, (Federal Register/Vol.59, No.147, August 2, 1994/Notices/39382)," for Lighting Effect Study and "NHTSA/DOT Highway Safety Programs; Model Specifications for Screening Devices to Measure Alcohol in Bodily Fluids, (Federal Register/Vol.73, No.62, March 3, 2008/Notices)" for the remaining performance studies.

# Laboratory Testing:

The performance characteristics of the Mission Saliva Alcohol Test Strip were evaluated by the following studies: precision, analytical specificity-blank reading, cigarette smoke interference, analytical specificity-volatile substances, temperature flexibility, lighting effect, reading time flexibility, and specimen storage and stability.

# Discussion of Clinical Tests Performed:

Clinical studies were conducted with laypersons and trained laboratory technicians using the Mission Saliva Alcohol Test Strip. The study data were presented evaluating the accuracy of the Mission® Saliva Alcohol Test Strip compared to an evidentiary breath test, Alco-Sensor IV, manufactured by Intoximeters Inc. which is a DOT/NHTSA approved device (Conforming Product List of Evidential Breath Alcohol Measurement Devices - FR/Vol 72, No 241/December 2007), per the ACON Clinical Study Protocol. Study results indicate that non-professional, inexperienced laypersons were able to obtain comparable readings when using the Mission Saliva Alcohol Test Strip as compared to the results obtained by the trained technicians. In addition, the participating laypersons were questioned and responded as satisfied with the ease of operation by following the Instructions for Use and the overall performance of the Mission Saliva Alcohol Test Strip.

# Conclusion:

The laboratory testing and clinical study results demonstrate that the Mission Saliva Alcohol Test Strip is safe, accurate and easy-to-use. It also demonstrates that the Mission Saliva Alcohol Test Strip is substantially equivalent to the Orasure Technologies QED A150 Saliva Alcohol Test, currently sold on the U.S. market.
