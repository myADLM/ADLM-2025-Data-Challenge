# Common Name:

Immunoassay, Drug of Abuse Screen Urine Test

# Classification:

Opiate Test System, Morphine Test System

# Predicate Devices

A one-step lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay. The device consists of any combination between one (1) to three (3) individual test strip(s) for the drug(s) being tested. Each test strip in the device consists of 1) a colored conjugate pad containing colloidal gold coupled with the anti-drug antibodies and 2) nitrocellulose membrane containing a test line (T line) coated with the conjugated drug antigen and a control line (C line). The C line serves as an internal quality control of the system and appears as a colored band during test regardless of the presence of

Dear Ms. Wang:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). This letter wil allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

# Indications for Use Statement

510(k) number (if known): K100051

Device Name:

INSTANT-ViEw® Drug of Abuse Urine (Cassette/Cup) Test

Drug of Abuse Urine (Cassette/Cup) Test

# Indications for Use:

The Drug of Abuse Urine (Cassette/Cup) Test is a rapid qualitative immunoassay for the detection of potential abuse of one or more drugs: Morphine/Opiates, and Oxycodone (see list below). The device is intended for in vitro diagnostic home use.

Abbreviation Test Calibrator Cutoff MOR/OPI300 Morphine/Opiates Morphine EY $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ OXY100 Oxycodone Oxycodone $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ OXY300 Oxycodone Oxycodone E $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$

This assay provides only preliminary results. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.
