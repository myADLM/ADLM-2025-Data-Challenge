These fragments spontaneouslyreassociate to form fully active enzymes that, inassay format, cleave a substrate, generating acolor change that canbe  measuredspectrophotometrically.In the assay, analyte in the specimen competeswith analyte conjugated−toone inactivefragment of β-galactosidase forantibodybinding site. If analyte is present in the sample,it binds to antibody, leaving the inactive enzymefragments free to form active enzymes.If analyte is not present in the sample, antibodybinds to analyte conjugated to the inactivefragment, inhibiting the reassociation of inactiveβ-galactosidasefragments, and noactiveenzyme is formed. The amount of activeenzyme formed and resultant absorbancechange are directly proportional to the amountof analyte present in the sample.</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">The QMS® Everolimus Assay system is ahomogeneous   assay   utilizing   particleagglutination technology andcompetitivebinding principles.In particle agglutination assays, the degree ofagglutination (detected by optical method at700nm)is inverselyproportional to thequantity of free drug in the reaction well.Hence, if no drug is present in the sample, thes   Evelimu AtoReagent (R1) will bind only to the bound drugon theparticlewhich willcause it toagglutinate and will  result  in  higherabsorbance.     If increased amount ofcompeting drug is present in the sample, thiswill result in decreased binding of bound drugby the antibody, resulting in a relativedecrease in particle agglutination. This in turnresults in lower absorbance. The preciserelationship between particle agglutination andconcentration of the unlabeled drug in thesample is established by measuring theabsorbance values of calibrators with knownconcentration of the drug. The absorbance ofunknown samples can be interpolated fromthe absorbance values of the calibration curveand the concentration of the drug present inthe sample can be calculated.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Sample Matrix</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Human Whole Blood</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Human Whole Blood</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">gents</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Two Lyophilized reagents (R1 and R2)One Liquid Ready-to-Use ReagentPrecipitation reagent)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Three Liquid Ready-to-Use reagents(R1,R2 and Precipitation reagent)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Reagent storage Condition</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2-8</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2-8</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Calibrators</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Lyophilized(0 and 30 ng/mL)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Liquid ready-to-use(0, 1.5, 3.0, 6.0,12.0 and 20.0 ng/mL)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Controls</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Lyophilized(Low, Medium, High)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Liquid ready-to-use(Low, Medium, High)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Calibrator andControl StorageCondition</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">5° ±3°C (2-8)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">-20° ± 5°C (15-25°C)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">CalibratorTraceability</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Traceable to purified sirolimus</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Traceable to calibration based on minimizationof bias between the QMS assay and anLCMSMS assay for a specified adult renaltransplant sample set.</td></tr></table>

# PERFORMANCE TESTING SUMMARY

# Functional Sensitivity (LOQ)

Functonal Sensitivity determines the lowest concentration which rsults at a C.V. $20 \%$ that has been measured over an extended period. The LOQ claim will be 2.0 ng/mL.

# Precision and Accuracy

vol  s n ll   pe s e $\% 0 v$ was less than or equal to $1 5 . 0 \%$ .

# Method Comparison

Samples were tested in the Everolimus Assay and compared to LC/MS. The method comparison   
exhibited correlated well with LC/MS as follows:   
System $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { 1 } } = 0 . 9 3 \times + 0 . 0 3 \ : \mathsf { R } 2 = 0 . 9 4$ EY   
System $2 = 1 . 0 0 x - 0 . 0 8 \ R 2 = 0 . 9 5$ EY

# Dilution Recovery

Samples were tested to demonstrate linearity throughout the assay range. Results showed that the assay performs in a linear fashion.

# On-Board Open Vial reagent Stability

Uncapped reagents were stored in an analyzer and al calibrators and controls were tested in the assay.   
Reagents stored on the analyzer are stable for up to 30 days.

# CONCLUSION

As summarized, the Thermo Scientific $\mathsf { Q M S } ^ { \otimes }$ Everolimus Assay is substantially equivalent to the CEDIA® Sirolimus Assay. Substantial equivalence has been demonstrated through performance testing to verify that the device functions as intended and that design specifications have been satisfied.
