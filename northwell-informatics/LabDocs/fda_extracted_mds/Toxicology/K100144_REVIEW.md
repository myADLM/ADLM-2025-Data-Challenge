The $\mathrm { Q M S } @$ Everolimus Control set is intended for use in quality control of the QMS $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Everolimus Assay.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

For prescription use.

See expected values section, below regarding interpretation of results.

The manufacturer includes the following in the package insert: On average, the assay is designed so that bias for patient samples relative to LCMS/MS systems is within 0 to $\pm 1 0 \%$ . However, as with other immunosuppressant immunoassays, caution should be exercised because results for individual patient samples may vary (in a positive or negative direction) due to the difference in metabolite accumulation or other errors.

The QMS Everolimus Assay is calibrated based on a training set of trough samples from adult renal transplant patients co-administered with cyclosporine, basiliximab induction therapy and corticosteroids. Relative to LC-MS/MS, comparison for patients under different conditions has not been evaluated and may be different. Comparability to LC-MS/MS has not been evaluated in pediatric patients and may be different due to differences in metabolism. The assay is indicated ONLY for renal transplant patients, and performance has not been determined for any other type of patients.

The assay should not be used on patients who have recently been administered sirolimus (until sirolimus parent compound and metabolites are fully cleared) since the assay cross-reacts with sirolimus and its metabolites.

Certain conditions, such as hepatic impairment, that can affect the parent compound to metabolite ratio in patient samples may affect performance (e.g. bias relative to an LC-MS/MS assay). For such patients, consider confirming results with an LC-MS/MS method specific for the parent compound.

Test findings should always be assessed in conjunction with the patient's medical history, clinical examinations and other findings.

4. Special instrument requirements:

Performance was evaluated on the Roche Hitachi 917.

CLSI EP-5, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods.

# L. Test Principle:

The QMS Everolimus Assay is a homogeneous particle-enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay based on competition between drug in the sample and drug coated onto a microparticle for antibody binding sites of the everolimus antibody reagent. The principle is based on everolimus-coated microparticle reagent agglutinating in the presence of the anti-everolimus antibody reagent and in the absence of any competing drug in the sample. The rate of absorbance change is measured photometrically at a wavelength of $7 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . When a sample containing everolimus is added, the agglutination reaction is partially inhibited, slowing down the rate of absorbance change. A concentration-dependent classic agglutination inhibition curve can be obtained with maximum rate of agglutination at the lowest everolimus concentration and the lowest agglutination rate at the highest everolimus concentration.

The approach taken by the manufacturer was that QMS Everolimus calibrators and controls were value-assigned by using a representative set of clinical trough samples from renal transplant patients with traceability to LC-MS/MS values. Limitations associated with this approach are described in the package insert.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Performance was validated on the Hitachi 917.

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Everolimus samples were used for precision testing, following a CLSI protocol. A tri-level human hemolysate-based control containing Everolimus, and 3 renal transplant patient whole blood sample pools were assayed on the Hitachi 917 for this study at the manufacturer’s site. For 20 non-consecutive days, each sample was run in duplicate. After a minimum of two hours within the same day, the samples were run again in duplicate, resulting in a total of 80 replicates. Each replicate was separately extracted. Calibration was performed initially and at intervals $( \mathrm { n } { = } 4 )$ throughout the precision evaluation. Results are tabulated below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity/recovery by dilution:

Linearity was determined by diluting renal transplant patient samples (containing near $2 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ as determined by an LCMSMS method) with hemolysate negative for everolimus, to yield 10 concentrations spanning the assay range from $< 2$ to near $2 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Each dilution was tested in triplicate using the $\mathrm { Q M S } @$ Everolimus Assay on two instruments using two calibration curves per instrument (for a total $\mathrm { \tt n } = 1 2$ ). Sample extractions were performed after preparation of each dilution. The averaged percent recovery, standard deviation, and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ are shown below.

Within the concentration ranges of $2 . 3 6 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ to $2 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , recoveries relative to expected concentrations (based on the high sample concentration and the dilution factor) were within $+ / - 1 0 \%$ , and no trends in recovery were observed. At lower measured concentrations $( < 2 \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ recoveries were near $1 1 5 \%$ .

Results shown above are based on dilution of patient samples. The manufacturer will note in the labeling that recovery studies with gravimetrically prepared spiked everolimus samples will under-recover significantly.

The LoQ study described below (see Detection Limit) further demonstrated that recovery at $2 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ was observed to be within $+ / - 1 5 \%$ of the theoretical value. The claimed measuring range is 2 to $2 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# High sample dilution:

A manual dilution study was conducted to verify the dilution procedure recommended in the package insert. Five patient samples containing   
concentrations near the high end of the assay were diluted 1:1 using the $\mathrm { Q M S } @$ Everolimus Calibrator A $( 0 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ Everolimus) and were then extracted. The samples were assayed undiluted and diluted using the $\mathrm { Q M S } @$ Everolimus Assay. Each was run in triplicate. The recovery was calculated as follows: (Recovered value) $\mathbf { X }$ (dilution factor) $=$ Calculated value   
The $\%$ difference and $\%$ Recovery were then calculated.   
The data is shown in the table below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Calibrator and control composition:

The QMS calibrator set consists of six levels of human whole blood hemolysate with everolimus using purified material from the drug manufacturer. Controls are prepared from the same types of materials. Also see device description above.

Calibrator and control value assignment and traceability:   
Initially, calibrator values were assigned by comparison of results of a patient sample set to an LCMSMS method, and adjustment of the assigned calibrator assigned values to minimize average bias relative to LCMSMS results. The sample set used for calibration consisted of trough samples from adult kidney transplant patients included in the initial Everolimus drug trials. Master calibrators values are traceable to these initially assigned values. Subsequent calibrator preparations are value assigned on the Hitachi 917 by ratio testing to the Master Calibrators. The ratio for the subsequent calibrator value must be $1 . 0 0 \substack { + / - 0 . 0 5 \mathrm { n g / m L } }$ for Cal B relative to the master calibrator and $1 . 0 0 + / -$ $0 . 0 2 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ for all other levels.

The sponsor’s estimated uncertainty of kit calibrators values used throughout the studies in the $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ is $0 . 2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (for lower concentration calibrators) to $< 0 . 7 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (for higher concentration calibrators).

The manufacturer notes in the package insert that third party control material containing spiked values of everolimus will not give the appropriate results when used in conjunction with the QMS Everolimus Assay, unless the values have been defined for the QMS Everolimus Assay. In addition, using the QMS Everolimus Assay calibrators and controls in analytical methods other than the QMS Everolimus Assay is not appropriate, as this would result in incorrect values being obtained.

Control materials are assigned by assaying each level on a Hitachi 917 clinical chemistry analyzer with five replicates per run, two runs per day for four days within a two week period. At least two operators, two lots and two instruments are used. Manufacturer’s ranges included in the package inserts are determined based on analyses of these results. The package insert states that each laboratory should determine its ranges for each new lot.

# Calibrator and control stability:

Results supporting the current claimed calibrator storage stability of 12 months (closed vial) at -20 degrees C were included in the 510(k). At each time point, test calibrators stored at -20 degrees C (the test temperature) were used to calibrate the assay and control material stored at a lower known stable temperature (-80 degrees C) was measured. Control recovery at each time point was compared to the zero time point. No trends in changes in recovery were observed over this time period.

Results supporting the current claimed calibrator storage stability of six weeks at 2-8 degrees C (opened vial) were included in the 510(k). At each time point, test calibrators stored at 2-8 degrees (the test temperature) were used to calibrate the assay and control material stored at a lower temperature (-20 degrees C) was measured. Control recovery at each time point was compared to the zero time point. No trends in changes in recovery were observed.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of quantitation was evaluated using patient samples with everolimus values known based on the LCMSMS method used in the drug clinical trials. Three kit lots were used in this evaluation. Samples with six levels of everolimus surrounding the estimated LoQ were measured with the QMS assay over five days with two runs per day. Recoveries for the sample closest to $2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ( $1 . 8 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ as determined by the LCMSMS method used during the everolimus drug clinical trials) ranged from $89 \%$ to $109 \%$ for the three lots measured.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference studies were conducted using CLSI protocol EP7-A2 as a guideline. Cross-reactivity was tested for major metabolites of everolimus. Other medications routinely administered with everolimus and endogenous substances were also tested to determine whether these compounds affect the quantitation of everolimus concentrations using the QMS Everolimus assay. The sponsor defined interference or cross-reactivity as ND (not detectable) if the difference between test and control samples was smaller than the SD of repeat control samples.

# Cross-reactivity:

The cross-reactivity of the QMS Everolimus assay to everolimus metabolites was evaluated. The compounds tested were added in two concentrations ( $5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and

$2 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ metabolite) to human blood hemolysate, which contained either $5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ of everolimus or no everolimus. Samples were tested with the QMS everolimus assay and results were compared to control samples (without metabolites).

Percent cross-reactivity was calculated as shown in the equation below; observed concentrations were based on average of 5 replicates. The results are shown below in the table below:

Cross-reactivity with sirolimus and its metabolites was also tested. Observed cross-reactivity ranged from $3 9 - 4 6 \%$ for parent sirolimus, $3 6 . 3 5 \%$ for a mixture of 41-O-desmethyl sirolimus and 32-O-desmethyl sirolimus, $1 1 - 1 2 \%$ for 11-hydroxy sirolimus and $< 1 0 \%$ for other sirolimus metabolites. The manufacturer notes in the labeling that the test should not be used on samples from patients who have recently been administered sirolimus, until sirolimus and its metabolites have been completely cleared.

# Other exogenous compounds tested:

Other compounds tested for interference were spiked into normal human hemolysate containing everolimus (at concentrations of $5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , and in some cases 0, and $2 . 6 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ). Samples were assayed by QMS in triplicate and mean results compared to control samples without the test compounds.

Results are shown below. The manufacturer includes a separate table in the package insert for the drugs that were observed to affect recovery by greater than $10 \%$ .

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Clinical samples were evaluated by the QMS method and the LCMSMS method (CRL method) used in the everolimus drug trials to support approval for everolimus use in kidney transplant patients. Samples were trough samples from 121 adult renal transplant patients. Results below are based on analysis of single measurements of each sample by each method. (Analyses showed there was no significant affect of within-patient correlation on results). Also see the site to site comparison in the Precision/Reproducibility section above.

$b$ . Matrix comparison: Not applicable. The assay is intended for use with EDTA whole blood only.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable; Clinical sensitivity and specificity is not typically provided in 510(k)s for this type of assay.

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable.   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Data regarding patient demographics and selection criteria were provided in the method comparison evaluation in the 510(k).

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable; this is a quantitative assay.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The following is stated in the package insert:

The recommended everolimus therapeutic range specified in the Zortress® package insert is 3 to $8 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ for prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult patients at low to moderate immunologic risk receiving a kidney transplant. This range is recommended when Zortress® is administered in combination with basiliximab induction and concurrently with reduced doses of cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Kidney transplant patients achieving everolimus whole blood trough concentrations less than $3 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (as determined by an LC-MS/MS

assay) are at increased risk for rejection.

The QMS Everolimus assay has been calibrated using a set of trough samples from adult renal transplant patients administered everolimus in combination with basiliximab and concurrently with reduced doses of cyclosporine and corticosteroids, so that on average results for these specimens will be within $+ / .$ - $10 \%$ of an LC-MS/MS system.

Test findings should always be assessed in conjunction with the patient's medical history, clinical signs and symptoms, and other laboratory parameters. Everolimus values cannot be used as the sole indicator for making changes in treatment regimen.

Values obtained with different methods cannot be used interchangeably due to differences in methods and cross-reactivity with metabolites, nor should correction factors be applied. Consistent use of the same assay for individual patients is strongly recommended.

Optimally, dose adjustments of everolimus should be based on trough concentrations obtained 4 or 5 days after a previous dosing change. See the drug package insert for further information, including potential drug interactions.
