CLSI EP17-A, Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation

# L. Test Principle:

The enzyme, acyl amidohydrolase, cleaves the amide bond of the acetaminophen molecule, leaving p-aminophenol and acetate. The p-aminophenol reacts with 8-hydroxoquinoline-5-sulfonic acid in the presence of manganese ions to form a colored compound 5-(4-iminophenol)-8-quinoline. The increased absorbance at $5 9 6 / 7 5 1 \ \mathrm { n m }$ is directly proportional to the concentration of acetaminophen in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision estimates were computed according to CLSI document EP05-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods. 10 days of precision studies were performed. Within run and total imprecision were evaluated by testing 3 individual, normal serum pools spiked with acetaminophen. In addition, 2 levels of a serum-based control material and a single-level calibrator (acetaminophen in human serum albumin) were tested. The acetaminophen levels were chosen to challenge the upper and lower limits of the expected range of the assay, the medically significant cut-off level as well as various levels throughout the assay range. Each sample was assayed 2 times per run and 2 runs per day for 10 days, totaling 40 replicates per system. The experiment was performed using one reagent lot on one ADVIA 1650 system. One operator performed the study.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The measuring range of the assay is $0 . 2 - 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Nine (9) diluted samples were prepared from high and low serum samples by dilution. Fresh normal human serum was spiked with approximately $2 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ of Acetaminophen, in order to provide a sample just above the desired upper range of the assay. The same serum, un-spiked, which contained no acetaminophen, was used as a low sample. The deviation was calculated as the difference of the expected value and the mean observed result of 2 replicates. Percent deviation for all acetaminophen-containing tested pools was less than $1 . 7 \%$ throughout the range of the assay.

Linear regression: $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 0 1 4 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 0 0 9 0$ ${ \mathsf { b } } = 1 . 0 0 1 4$ ( $9 5 \%$ Confidence interval 0.9967 - 1.0060)

$\mathbf { a } = - 0 . 0 0 9 0$ $9 5 \%$ Confidence interval -0.0643 - 0.0462)

$\mathrm { r } = 1 . 0 0 0$

The results of the study demonstrated that the acetaminophen assay is linear up to the sponsor’s stated claim of 0.2 to $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

Automatic rerun conditions for this method extend the analytical range to 60 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . An acetaminophen-free serum sample was spiked to approximately 60 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ $3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ }$ times the analytical range of the ADVIA assay) with purified acetaminophen. A series of dilutions of this sample was made using an unspiked acetaminophen-free sample. The expected concentration of the samples above the range of the assay was calculated based on the values within the assay range times dilution factor. The sample was assayed with automatic high-range rerun enabled. This data was generated using one system and one reagent lot with each level assayed in duplicate (one operator)

The highest level tested gave an ADVIA value of $6 1 . 7 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ which is $1 0 1 . 2 \%$ of the expected value of $6 1 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

ADVIA Chemistry Acetaminophen assay is calibrated using ADVIA Chemistry ToxAmmonia calibrators cleared previously under k023184. The ADVIA Chemistry Acetaminophen method is traceable to an internal standard manufactured using purified material.

# d. Detection limit:

The sponsor set the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the assay at $0 . 2 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ which is consistent with the low end of the linearity and precision studies (see 1. a. above).

# e. Analytical specificity:

The sponsor tested potential interferents up to the indicated levels and the results shown in the table below. The sponsor defined $< 1 0 \%$ interference as not significant in this evaluation.

\* $\mathrm { N S I } = \mathrm { N o }$ Significant Interference. A percentage effect $2 1 0 \%$ is considered a significant interference. \*\*s  tiolein

The table is included in the labeling. The sponsor states in the labeling that visibly hemolyzed or lipemic samples should not be tested and that significant interference may occur at very low concentrations of acetaminophen with hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.

Specific therapy for acetaminophen overdose is to administer N-acetylcysteine (NAC, Mucomyst). The potential for NAC interference in the acetaminophen assay was examined. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) at the level up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ was spiked in a serum sample pool with approximate acetaminophen concentration of $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Multiple levels of NAC were tested. The tested samples were prepared by various dilutions of a pool with the highest concentration of interferent with the same pool without interferent (control). Calculations were performed by comparing observed Acetaminophen concentration at each level of interferent vs. observed Acetaminophen concentration of control (no interferent) expressed in $\%$ . No significant effect of NAC, defined by the sponsor, a $\mathbf { s } < 1 0 \%$ interference was seen up to 800 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . A $- 2 0 \%$ effect was seen at a level of $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ NAC. The following information is included in the labeling:

Interference from N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was evaluated on ADVIA Chemistry system. Using a significance criterion of $> I O \%$ variance from control, acceptable results were obtained to a concentration of $\cdot 8 0 0 m g / L$ N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in a 10.2 mg/dL acetaminophen sample; this invitro analysis was performed approximately two hours after the addition of NAC to a serum pool. Note: Significantly reduced Acetaminophen recovery has been demonstrated in situations where testing has been performed immediately after the introduction of NAC. It is recommended that laboratories review NAC treatment and monitoring protocols to determine the extent of the potential interference.

The sponsor tested the effect of potentially interfering drugs using 2 human serum pools with acetaminophen concentrations of approximately $0 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $3 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . A single level of interferent was tested at the concentration in the table below. The method was considered by the sponsor to have no significant interference (NSI) if a bias between control and observed acetaminophen concentration is $< 1 0 \%$ . The table below is included in the sponsor’s labeling.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A total of 95 serum samples were analyzed in singlicate on the ADVIA Chemistry 1650 system using ADVIA Chemistry Acetaminophen method vs. the Genzyme Acetaminophen method to demonstrate the equivalence of the two methods. The study was conducted using one lot of Genzyme Acetaminophen reagent and one lot of ADVIA Chemistry Acetaminophen reagent. One trained operator performed the study. Serum samples ranged from 0.4 to $1 9 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . These values span the proposed measuring range of the assay $( 0 . 2 - 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . The linear regression equation from the study yielded the following results:

Linear regression: $\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 2 1 \mathbf { x }$ ( $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals $= 1 . 0 1 6 1 - 1 . 0 2 6 5 ) +$ 0.18,( $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals $= 0 . 1 3 - 0 . 2 2 )$ ; $\mathrm { r } = 1 . 0 0 0$

# b. Matrix comparison:

Serum / plasma equivalency studies were performed to characterize the correlation between serum and lithium heparin plasma samples. 24 matched serum and plasma (Li-heparin) samples were collected in-house. The paired serum and plasma pairs (from same donor) were spiked with identical levels of purified acetaminophen to achieve concentrations of acetaminophen ranging from 0.75 to $1 8 . 0 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The samples were analyzed with the ADVIA Chemistry Acetaminophen method on one system using one lot of reagent, in singlicate. Results were analyzed using linear regression. The linear regression equation from the study yielded the following result:

$$
\mathrm { y } + 1 . 0 1 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 0 3 , \mathrm { r } = 1 . 0 0 0
