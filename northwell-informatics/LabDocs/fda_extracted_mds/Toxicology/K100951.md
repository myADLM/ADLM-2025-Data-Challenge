Predicate Device: Acon BUP One Step Buprenorphine Test (K060466)

# Description of the Device

The MEDTOX® Buprenorphine Test is a rapid, single use, one-step qualitative immunochromatographic screening assay for the detection of Buprenorphine and its metabolites in human urine.

# Intended Use

The MEDTOX Buprenorphine Test uses immunochromatographic test strips for the rapid, qualitative detecionof buprenorphine and ts metabolites inhuman urinet s intended or prescriptin us. The MEDTOX Buprenorphine Test is not for over-the-counter sale. It is not intended for use in pointcare settings.

MEDTOX Buprenorphine detects buprenorphine and its metabolites at the following cutoff concentrations:

BUP Buprenorphine (Buprenorphine) 10 ng/mL

The MEDTOX Buprenorphine Test provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method.Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any test result.

# Discussion of Technological Characteristics:

# Similarities and differences to predicate device

Both the MEDTOX® Buprenorphine Test and the predicate test are used to detect the presence of buprenorphine and its metabolites in human urineIn both systems, a urine sample is added to the test device and allowed to react for a specified period of time, after which the test device is read and interpreted visually.Both the MEDTOx® Buprenorphine Test and predicate test devices are rapid single isposable devices that use mmunochromatographic ateral low technologyBoth he METO

Buprenorphine Test and predicate test devices utilize gold-conjugated reagents to generate the reddishpurple test and control lines, which are read visually.

Sample is applied to the MEDTOx® Burpenorphine Test by tilting a urine cup containing urine, while sp pl he pa  ipeehe toe The MEDTOX® Burpenorphine Test has a read time window of 5 to 15 minutes, while the predicate test read time window is 5 to 10 minutes.

# Related Compounds and Cross Reactants

The metabolites and reacting compounds shown in Table 3 below were evaluated on the MEDTOX® Buprenorphine Test for interference or cross reactivity with Buprenorphine.Reference standards or he various metabolites and compounds were prepared in negative urine samples. Results are expressed as the approximate minimum concentration required to produce a positive result in the indicated assay. Compounds that reacted with he test are listed first, and related compounds that did not react with he highest concentration tested are listed second as Negative at 100,000 ng/mL (or highest level tested). The $" \%$ Cross-Reactive" values were calculated from the cut-off level for the calibrator used for each test (approximate $50 \%$ positive rate) divided by the lowest reported level found to react in the same test (greater than $6 6 \%$ positive rate). Three different lots were tested and identical results were obtained.

# Interference Data

# pH and Specific Gravity:

The MEDT $\overline { { \mathsf { O X } } } ^ { \otimes }$ Buprenorphine Test was assayed with four negative clinical samples with pH values of 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, and ${ \pm \ : 0 . 0 \pm 0 . 1 }$ . Each sample was assayed in triplicate. The pH samples were fortified with buprenorphine to the concentrations of 5 ng/mL and $1 5 n g / m L$ . All the pH levels gave negative results when fortified to $5 n g / m L$ , and all pH levels gave positive results when fortified to $1 5 n g / m L$ .

The MEDTOx® Buprenorphine test was assayed with three samples with specific gravity values of 1.003, 1.015 and $1 . 0 3 0 \pm 0 . 0 0 1$ . Each sample was assayed in triplicate. The specific gravity samples were fortified with buprenorphine to the concentrations of $5 n g / m L$ and 15 ng/mL. All the specific gravity levels gave negative esults when forifd to 5 ng/m,and all speciic graviy levels gave positive esults whe fortified to $1 5 \ n g / m L$ .

# Discussion of Clinical Tests Performed for Determination of Substantial Equivalence:

The accuracy of the MEDTOx® Buprenorphine Test was evaluated by assaying a panel of blind coded clinical urine samples containing varying concentrations of buprenorphine and its metabolites, and comparing the results with LC/MS/MS results. The samples were obtained from MEDTOX® Laboratories and are representative of intended population of clinical samples.Samples were screened with the CEDIA immunoassay system(Buprenorphine cutoff of 5ng/ml). Samples are stratified into the five following groups: (1) Negative samples were screened negative by CEDIA immunoassay system, $10 \%$ of which were confirmed negative by LC/MS/MS; (2) Near Cutoff Negative samples that fell between $50 \%$ of the cutoconentrationand thecuto concentrationNearCuto ositivesmples that ell bee the cutoff concentration and $1 5 0 \%$ of the cutoff concentration; and (4) High Positive samples that were greater than $1 5 0 \%$ of cutoff concentration. Concentrations measured by LC/MS/MS included the testsic analytes buprenorphine and norbuprenorphie) found in the sample.The testing was performed bin-house operators according t the package insert.The results were interpreted visually at fiv minutes. No false positives were observed in the absence of drug. The tests were read at both 5 minutes and 15 minutes and identical results were obtained. The results are summarized in Table 5 below.

# Conclusions:

The MEDTOx® Buprenorphine Test has the same intended use and similar technological characteristics as the predicate device. Moreover, bench testing contained in this submission demonstrates that any differences in their technological characteristics do not raise any new issues of safety or effectiveness. Thus, the MEDTOx® Buprenorphine Test is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
