# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See Indications for use, below.

2. Indication(s) for use:

The MEDTOX Buprenorphine Test uses immunochromatographic test strips for the rapid, qualitative detection of buprenorphine and its metabolites in human urine. It is intended for prescription use only. The MEDTOX Buprenorphine Test is not for over the-counter sale. It is not intended for use in point-of-care settings.

MEDTOX Buprenorphine detects buprenorphine and its metabolites at the following cutoff concentrations:

BUP Buprenorphine (Buprenorphine) $1 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$

The MEDTOX Buprenorphine Test provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Liquid   
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any test result.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

As noted in the indications for use, the device is not intended for over the counter sale and is not intended for use in point of care settings.

Tests for buprenorphine cannot distinguish between abused drugs and certain prescribed medications.

4. Special instrument requirements:

None

# I. Device Description:

The MEDTOX Buprenorphine Test contains a device with competitive, membrane-based immunochromatographic test strips, a cup and a lid.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced.

# L. Test Principle:

When the test system cup is tipped urine flows into the sample pads of the device, the dried antibody-colloidal gold on the sample pad dissolves and the urine wicks up the white test strips carrying the red antibody colloidal gold with it. When a drug is present in the sample the antibody-colloidal gold binds the drug before it migrates up the test strip. However, when the antibody-colloidal gold bind the drug in the urine, the antibodycolloidal gold cannot bind to the drug conjugate immobilized on the test strip. When the drug concentration is at or above the cutoff concentration, the majority of the antibody colloidal gold is bound to the drug from the urine. Therefore, as drug bound antibodycolloidal gold migrates up the test strip, it is unable to bind to the drug conjugate immobilized on the membrane. Therefore no line is generated at the “T” location on the device for a non-negative sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Samples containing commercial buprenorphine calibrator spiked into a drug-free urine pool to the concentrations shown in the table below were tested with the MEDTOX Buprenorphine Test. Sample concentrations $> 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ were also confirmed by LCMS. Reproducibility testing was performed by three operators. Each ran masked randomized samples across five days, using one lot, 3 operators;

3 samples; $5 \mathrm { d a y s } = 4 5$ reps per level. Results are tabulated below, and demonstrate that test results at concentrations $50 \%$ above and $50 \%$ below the cutoff were all consistently correct.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable. This is a qualitative test. There is no high dose hook effect with the MEDTOX Buprenorphine Test. Testing with spiked samples demonstrated that the MEDTOX Buprenorphine Test provides positive results at concentrations above those attainable in human urine.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Both real time and accelerated stability studies were performed. The manufacturer’s acceptance criteria require that the control materials, including those containing 5 and $1 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ buprenorphine, must give the expected qualitative result at the expiration date under the recommended storage conditions (25 degrees C). Controls are prepared by adding known quantities of drug or metabolite to a stabilized urine matrix. Levels of drug in each lot of controls are confirmed by GC/MS or LC/MS/MS methods.

Control materials are listed as required but are not included with the kit.

# d. Detection limit:

Evaluations were performed to determine the test detection limit, using multiple lots and operators.

Buprenorphine (with purity certified by the manufacturer) was spiked into a negative urine pool to the concentration levels shown in the table below. Each concentration was tested 30 times in each of three lots by a total of 10 operators. Results across lots are similar to those observed for the precision study (above).

# e. Analytical specificity:

Studies were performed to test the effect of (1) potentially cross reactive compounds and (2) potentially interfering endogenous and exogenous substances. All compounds tested were obtained from commercial suppliers.

# Potential Cross-reacting compounds:

The following potential cross-reactants and metabolites were prepared in negative urine samples. Results are expressed as the minimum concentration expected to produce a positive result in the indicated assay. The non-reacting opiate compounds were also tested in the presence of $5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ( $50 \%$ of the cutoff) and $1 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ( $1 5 0 \%$ of the cutoff) of Buprenorphine. Samples were evaluated in triplicate by in-house operators. None of the nonreactive opiate listed in the following table affected the expected results.

pH and specific gravity:

Interference from $\mathrm { p H }$ was tested fortifying negative urine samples adjusted to pH 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and $8 . 0 \left( \pm 0 . 1 \right)$ with buprenorphine added at the $5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ of cutoff and $1 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . These buprenorphine levels correspond to those at which $59 5 \%$ negative and $59 5 \%$ positive results were observed, respectively. Interference from specific gravity was tested by fortifying three negative urine samples, adjusted to specific gravity values of 1.003, 1.015, and $1 . 0 3 0 \pm 0 . 0 0 1$ , with buprenorphine added at concentrations of $5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $1 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

All samples were assayed in triplicate. No effect of $\mathsf { p H }$ or specific gravity was observed in this evaluation.

f. Assay cut-off: See Detection Limit Section, above.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Samples used in the method comparison studies were leftover (de-linked) and randomized clinical urine samples that had been submitted for drug testing and contained varying concentrations of buprenorphine. Samples were assayed and selected using both screening and confirmatory (LC/MS/MS) methods. All samples containing buprenorphine (whether above or below the cutoff concentration), were confirmed by LC/MS/MS. The LC/MS/MS determination included buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine. There was one specimen obtained per patient and one measurement taken per specimen.

The MEDTOX Buprenorphine Tests results were interpreted at both 5 minutes and 15 minutes (covering the recommended read-time range), and identical results were obtained at both time intervals.

The operator who performed the method comparison testing was representative of those expected to perform such testing at the intended use sites, including reference laboratories.

Results are shown in the table below:
