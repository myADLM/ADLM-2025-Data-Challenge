# Intended use

The CEDIA® Cannabinoids OFT Assay is intended for use in the qualitative determination of Cannabinoids in human oral fluid at a cutoff concentration of 3 ng/mL in neat oral fluid. The specimen must be collected exclusively with the Oral-Eze ™m Saliva Collection System. The assay is calibrated against $1 - \Delta ^ { \theta }$ THC and performed on the MGC 240. This in vitro diagnostic device is intended for clinical laboratory use only.

The CEDIA THC OFT Calibrators are intended for use in the calibration of $1 - \Delta ^ { \mathfrak { s } }$ THC when used with the CEDIA Cannabinoids OFT Assay. This in vitro diagnostic device is intended for clinical laboratory use only.

The CEDIA Cannabinoids OFT Assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) are the preferred confirmatory methods. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result particularly when preliminary positive results are used.

# Conditions for use

The $C E D A ^ { \otimes }$ Cannabinoids OFT Assay is for prescription professional use only in clinical chemistry laboratories. It is not for use in Point of Care settngs.

# Legally marketed device to which equivalency is claimed

CEDIA® Cannabinoids OFT Assay is substantially equivalent to the previously cleared STC Cannabinoids Intercept® MICRO-PLATE EIA, KO02375 (At present OTI, OraSure Technologies Inc.)

DESCRIPTION OF DEVICE

# CEDIA® Cannabinoids OFT Assay

Microgenics $C E D \mathsf { I A } ^ { \otimes }$ Cannabinoids OFT Assay uses recombinant DNA technology to produce a unique homogeneous enzyme immunoassay system. The assay is based on the bacterial enzyme $\beta \cdot$ -galactosidase, which has been genetically engineered into two inactive fragments. These fragments spontaneously re-associate to form fully active enzyme that, in the assay format, cleave a substrate, generating a color change that can be measured spectrophotometrically.

In the assay, analyte in the sample competes with analyte conjugated to one inactive fragment (enzyme donor) of $\beta$ -galactosidase for antibody binding site. If analyte is present in te sample, t binds toantibody, leaving the inactive enzyme fragment free o form aive enzyme. If the analyte is not present in the sample, antibody binds to analyte conjugated on the inactive fragment, inhibiting the re-association of inactive $\beta$ galactosidase fragments, and no active enzyme is formed. The amount of active enzyme formed and resultant absorbance change are directly proportional to the amount of analyte present in the sample.

# Principle of Oral-Eze™ Saliva Collection System

The Oral-Eze™ Saliva Collection System consists of Oral-Eze™m saliva collector and collection tube with preservative buffer. Oral-Eze™ saliva collector consists of an absorbent p ttace   plasichaneTsaliv collecor roi wih volede indicator. The plastic handle has a round window where blue color will appear when sufficient volume of oral fluid is collected. Samples are collected by placing the collector pad and plastic shield between lower cheek and gum with the plastic shield facing the cheek. Oral fluid collection is done when blue color appears in the window of the handle. The pad is ejected in to the collection tube by placing thumb on the ridges on the handle and pushing the thumb forward. The collection tube is capped and sent to the laboratory for processing and testing.
