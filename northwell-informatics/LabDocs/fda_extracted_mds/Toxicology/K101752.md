# Intended use

The $C E D / A ^ { \circledast }$ Multi-Drug OFT Calibrators are intended for use in the calibration of $d -$ Amphetamine, Benzoylecgonine, Morphine and Phencyclidine (PCP) in human Oral Fluid when used with the CEDIA Amphetamine, Cocaine, Opiate, and Phencyclidine (PCP) OFT Assays on the MGC 240 analyzer. This in vitro diagnostic device is intended for clinical laboratory use only.

# Legally marketed device to which equivalency is claimed

The $C E D 1 A ^ { \otimes }$ Multi-Drug OFT Calibrators are substantially equivalent to the previously cleared CEDIA® DAU Multi-Drug Calibrators (K980853).

# Description of the device

The CEDIA® Multi-Drug OFT Calibrators are liquid ready-to-use. They are prepared by spiking known quantities of Amphetamine, Benzoylecgonine, Morphine and PCP in to buffer matrix. The Cutoff Calibrator is used as a qualitative cutoff reference for distinguishing "positive" from "negative" samples. The concentration for each drug in the calibrators is listed in table below. Concentrations for each calibrator are confirmed by LC-MS/MS methodology.

# Conclusion

As summarized, the $C E D \mid A ^ { \otimes }$ Multi-Drug OFT Calibrators are substantially equivalent to the CEDIA® Multi-Drug DAU Calibrators. Substantial equivalence has been demonstrated through performance testing to verify that the device functions as intended and that design specifications have been satisfied.

Dear Ms. Charter:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in he Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies.

You must comply with al the Act's requirements, including, but not lmited to registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good mancturi practc reqieents as  rh nhe quality stes ( regulatn (21 CFR Part 820).
