# I. Device Description:

CEDIA $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Methamphetamine OFT Assay The CEDIA $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Methamphetamine OFT Assay uses recombinant DNA technology to produce a unique homogeneous enzyme immunoassay system. The assay is based on the bacterial enzyme $\beta$ -galactosidase, which has been genetically engineered into two inactive fragments i.e., enzyme acceptor (EA) and enzyme donor (ED). These fragments spontaneously re-associate to form fully active enzyme that, in the assay format, cleaves a substrate, generating a color change that can be measured spectrophotometrically. In the assay, analyte in the sample competes with analyte conjugated to one inactive fragment of $\beta$ -galactosidase for antibody binding site. If analyte is present in the sample, it binds to antibody, leaving the inactive enzyme Fragments free to form active enzyme.

If analyte is not present in the sample, antibody binds to analyte conjugated on the inactive fragment, inhibiting the re-association of inactive $\beta \mathrm { . }$ -galactosidase fragments, and no active enzyme is formed. The amount of active enzyme formed and resultant absorbance change are directly proportional to the amount of drug present in the sample.

The CEDIA $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Methamphetamine OFT Assay consists of separately packaged reagents (R1, R1a, R2, and R2a):

The Oral-Eze Saliva Collection System consists of Oral-Eze saliva collector and collection tube with preservative buffer. Oral-Eze saliva collector consists of an absorbent pad attached to a plastic handle. The saliva collector is provided with a volume adequacy indicator. The plastic handle has a round window where blue color will appear when sufficient volume of oral fluid is collected. Samples are collected by placing the collector pad and plastic shield between lower cheek and gum with the plastic shield facing the cheek. Oral fluid collection is done when blue color appears in the window of the handle. The pad is ejected in to the collection tube by placing thumb on the ridges on the handle and pushing the thumb forward. The collection tube is capped and sent to the laboratory for processing and testing.

# L. Test Principle:

Principle of Methamphetamine OFT Assay

Enzyme fragment complementation assays are based on competition between Methamphetamine in the sample and labeled-methamphetamine for a fixed amount of antibody in the reagent. The presence of Methamphetamine in saliva sample facilitates the association of two inactive $\beta$ -galactosidase enzyme fragments into an active enzyme complex that hydrolyzes a substrate, generating a color change that can be measured spectrophotometrically.

Specifically, methamphetamine in the saliva sample competes with Methamphetamine conjugated to one inactive fragment of $\beta$ -galactosidase for antibody binding site. If methamphetamine is present in the saliva sample, it binds to antibody, leaving the inactive enzyme fragments free to form active enzyme. If Methamphetamine is not present in the saliva sample, antibody binds to methamphetamine conjugated on the inactive fragment, inhibiting the re-association of inactive $\beta$ -galactosidase fragments, and no active enzyme complex is formed. The amount of active enzyme formed and resultant absorbance change are directly proportional to the amount of Methamphetamine present in the sample.

The calibrator is set at diluted levels so that sample absorbance values can be compared directly to the absorbance values of the calibration curve. The assay result is reported as a positive or negative result relative to the neat oral fluid cutoff of 120.0 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# Principle of Oral-Eze Saliva Collection System

The Oral-Eze Saliva Collection System contains a preservative buffer that dilutes the neat oral fluid sample. The calibrator levels are set at diluted levels so that sample absorbance values can be compared directly to the absorbance values of the calibration curve. The assay result is reported as a positive or negative result relative to the neat oral fluid cutoff of $1 2 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# 1. Analytical performance:

All analytical performance data was collected on neat human oral fluid samples and processed through the Oral-Eze Saliva Collection System and analyzed on the MGC 240 instrument. The Oral-Eze collection device includes a diluent that results in a dilution of approximately 1/3. The assay cannot be used to measure undiluted (neat) samples. Analyte concentrations refer to the neat oral fluid concentration, unless otherwise noted.

# a. Precision and Reproducibility

Negative neat oral fluid samples were collected and then prepared by spiking methamphetamine at negative, $- 7 5 \%$ , $- 5 0 \%$ , $- 2 5 \%$ , below the cutoff, at the cutoff, and $+ 2 5 \%$ , $+ 5 0 \%$ , $+ 7 5 \%$ and $+ 1 0 0 \%$ above the cutoff. All spiked neat oral fluid sample concentrations were confirmed by LC-MS/MS. The neat oral fluid samples were processed using the Oral-Eze device to obtain diluted oral fluid samples. The diluted oral fluid samples were confirmed by LC-MS/MS and tested in the CEDIA Methamphetamine OFT Assay in qualitative mode.

The randomized CLSI (EP5-A2) precision protocol was followed with five replicates of each sample for each run, 2 runs per day for five non-consecutive days, total $\Nu { = } 5 0 ,$ /level.

The results are summarized in the table below.

The above data satisfies the acceptance criteria claimed by the sponsor.

Stability

The sponsor provided experimental data for accelerated closed vial, open vial and closed real time vial stability studies

Open Vial Stability

Open-Vial Stability Studies were conducted on one lot of calibrators in qualitative mode at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and time points were every two weeks for 50 days. Testing was done in replicates of three. The open vial stability of reconstituted reagents is 50 days $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ .

Closed-Vial Real-Time $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ ) Calibrator Stability

Real-Time Stability Studies were conducted on three lots of calibrators in qualitative mode at $2 { \cdot } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } .$ .Testing was done in replicates of three time points for 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 months.

The data provided by the sponsor satisfied the acceptance criteria of Methamphetamine OFT Calibrators real time stability claim at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 18 months.

Sample and reagent storage stability

Reagent:

Reagents were stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ }$ and tested every 3 months for the first year and then every 6 months for the 2 years using Reference calibrators stored at - $2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .

Sample:

The stability of oral fluid samples in the preservative buffer was evaluated in real time. The stability protocol was reviewed and found acceptable. Oral fluid samples can be stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or at room temperature $( 2 1 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ for 21 days.

Shipping stability studies

Sample shipment/travel stability:

Conditions simulating ground shipping, air shipping and various climate conditions (desert, tropical) were tested. Samples spiked at concentrations below the cutoff $( - 5 0 \% )$ recovered as negative for both the control and shipped samples. Samples spiked at concentrations above the cutoff $( + 5 0 \% )$ recovered as positive for both the control and shipped samples. The shipping temperature should not exceed ${ > } 4 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .

d. Detection limit:

Analytical performance of the device around the cutoff is described in the precision section 1.a above.

e. Analytical specificity:

The sponsor performed analytical specificity studies on four categories of potential interferents: structurally related substances, structurally unrelated substances, substances endogenous to oral fluid, and food and dental substances.

# Cross Reactivity to Structurally Related Compounds

Cross-reactivity was evaluated by spiking various concentrations (which could be found in a neat oral fluid sample) of structurally related compounds into drug-free neat oral fluid pool, than added to the oral fluid collection device. By analyzing various concentration of each compound the sponsor determined the concentration of the drug that produced a response approximately equal to the cutoff. Results of those studies appear in the table below.

# Endogenous, Exogenous Substances and pH Interference

The potential interference from several endogenous and exogenous substances, and $\mathrm { p H }$ on the detection accuracy of samples containing methamphetamine at $+ / .$ - $50 \%$ of the cutoff concentration were tested in the assay. The interfering substances were added to neat oral fluid at the concentrations listed in the table below. The neat oral fluid samples were then processed using the Oral-Eze collection device and tested in the CEDIA Methamphetamine OFT Assay. No interference was observed with the interfering substances and $\mathrm { p H } 5  – 9$ samples at the $+ / -$ $50 \%$ cutoff concentrations.

f. Assay cut-off:

Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff concentration appears in the precision above.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison:

Two separate studies were conducted. In the first study, MAMP was spiked in to samples that had already been collected through the intercept device. In the second study samples were spiked with MAMP prior to the collection step to reflect the operation of the entire system.

Study 1:

41 unaltered clinical samples were tested in the CEDIA Methamphetamine OFT Assay in qualitative mode. The results were compared to GC/MS results. All samples were confirmed by GC/MS.

Note: The values obtained in this study were collected from samples spiked with MAMP prior to the collection step. Therefore the results reflect the performance of the entire system including the collection step.

$\%$ Agreement among positive and negative is $100 \%$ .

LC/MS/MS values used to categorize samples in this table are based on the concentration found in the neat oral fluid sample.

Study 2: Eighty one unaltered clinical samples were tested in the CEDIA Methamphetamine OFT Assay in qualitative mode. The results were compared to GC/MS results. All samples were confirmed by GC/MS.

Note: this study was performed on samples already collected with the Intercept collection device. Therefore the results below do not reflect any inaccuracy inherent in the collection process itself.
