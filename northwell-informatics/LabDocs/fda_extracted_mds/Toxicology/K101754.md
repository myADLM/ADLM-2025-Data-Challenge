# Intended use

The CEDIA® Opiate OFT Assay is intended for use in the qualitative determination of opiate in human oral fluid at a cutoff concentration of 30 ng/mL in neat oral fluid. The specimen must be collected exclusively with the Oral-Eze ™m Saliva Collection System. The assay is calibrated against morphine and performed on the MGC240. This in vitro diaanostic device is intended for clinical laboratory use only.

The CEDIA Opiate OFT Assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) are the preferred confirmatory methods. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result particularly when preliminary positive results are used.

# Conditions for use

The CEDIA® Opiate OFT Assay is for prescription professional use only in clinical chemistrv laboratories. It is not for use in Point of Care settings.

Legally marketed device to which equivalency is claimed

CEDIA® Opiate OFT Assay is substantially equivalent to the previously cleared STC Opiates MICRO-PLATE EIA, K981341 (At present OTI, OraSure Technoloqies Inc.)

# DESCRIPTION OF DEVICE

# A

Microgenics CEDIA® Opiate OFT Assay uses recombinant DNA technology to produce a unique homogeneous enzyme immunoassay system. The assay is based on the bacterial enzyme β-galactosidase, which has been genetically engineered into two inactive fragments. These fragments spontaneously re-associate to form fully active enzyme that, in the assay format, cleave a substrate, generating a color change that can be measured spectrophotometrically.

In the assay, analyte in the sample competes with analyte conjugated to one inactive fragment (enzyme donor) of β-galactosidase for antibody binding site: If analyte is present in the sample, it binds to antibody, leaving the inactive enzyme fragment free to form active enzyme. If the analyte is not present in the sample, antibody binds to analyte conjugated on the inactive fragment, inhibiting the re-association of inactive β-galactosidase fragments, and no active enzyme is formed. The amount of active enzyme formed and resultant absorbance change are directly proportional to the amount of analyte present in the sample.

# Principle of Oral-Eze™ Saliva Collection System

The Oral-Eze™ Saliva Collection System consists of Oral-Eze™ saliva collector and collection tube with preservative buffer. Oral-Eze™ saliva collector consists of an absorbent pad attached to a plastic handle. The saliva collector is provided with a volume adequacy indicator. The plastic handle has a round window where blue color will appear when sufficient volume of oral fluid is collected. Samples are collected by placing the collector pad and plastic shield between lower cheek and gum with the plastic shield facing the cheek. Oral fluid collection is done when blue color appears in the window of the handle. The pad is ejected in to the collection tube by placing thumb on the ridges on the handle and pushing the thumb forward. The collection tube is capped and sent to the laboratory for processing and testing.

# Comparison of Technological Characteristics

The CEDIA® Opiate OFT Assay is substantiaily equivalent to the OTI Opiates MICROPLATE EIA. (K981341)

# SUMMARY OF CLINICAL TESTING

# Qualitative Precision

All samples tested recovered accurately. Samples at levels below the cutoff read as negauve and samnles at levels above the cutoff read as positive.

# Qualitative Cutoff Characterization

All samples tested recovered accurately, low control as negative and high control level as positive.

# Interferences

# Specificity and Cross-Reactivity

Cross-reactivity to metabolites and structurally related compounds was tested in the assay. No sinnificant cross-reactivity was observed with other structurally unrelated compounds.

# Method Comparison

The overall concordance between the CEDIA® Opiate OFT Assay and GC/MS is 97.6%. Ihe comparison of sample results by the CEDIA® Opiate OFT Assay to GC/MS showed 100.0 % sensitivity and $9 5 . 2 \%$ specificity.

# Conclusion

As summarized, the CEDIA® Opiate OFT Assay is substantially equivalent to the OTI Opiates MICRO-PLATE EIA. Substantial equivalence has been demonstrated through performance testing to verify that the device functions as intended and that design specifications have been satisfied.
