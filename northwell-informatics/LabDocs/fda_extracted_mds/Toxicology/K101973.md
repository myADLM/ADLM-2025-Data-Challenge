# Product Name:

Trade Name:

the Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assay Methamphetamine_3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (Meth_MDMA)

# Common Name:

Hair Drug Screening Assay Methamphetamine

Regulation Number:

CFR 862.3610 (ProCode LAF)

Classification Name:

Enzyme immunoassay, Methamphetamine Methamphetamine test System

Classification Panel: Predicate Device:

91 (Toxicology) Quest Diagnostics HairCheck-DT (Amphetamines) k051161;

Product Description:

The Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assays for Opiates, Oxycodone and Hydrocodone are test systems using ELISA reagents and micro-plate reader for the qualitative detection of Opiates, Oxycodone and Hydrocodone in hair samples at or above 300 pg/mg.

Indication for Use:

The Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assay for Methamphetamine and MDMA is a laboratory developed test that is intended to be used for the determination of the presence of Methamphetamine and 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in human hair from the crown of the head. The Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assay (AMP) utilizes International Diagnostics Systems Corp One-Step Methamphetamine ELISA for Hair Testing Kit for the qualitative detection of Methamphetamine and MDMA at or above 500 pg/mg of hair for the purpose of identifying the use of Methamphetamine and MDMA. D-Methamphetamine is used as the

# Omega Laboratories, Inc. 510(k) Summary Omega Hair Drug Screening Assay for Methamphetamine and MDMA

standard for the assay. To confirm a screen positive result a more specific alternate chemical method, such as Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) operating in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode is the preferred method with deuterated internal standards. Professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when presumptive positive results are obtained.

# Comparison:

When used to qualitatively detect methamphetamine and/or MDMA in head hair specimens collected with the Omega Specimen Collection Device, the Omega assays yield results in substantial agreement with the predicate device.

# Comparison Performance Data:

Performance characteristic studies were conducted for

Precision

Agreement

Cosmetic Treatment

Cross-reactivity

Environmental Contamination

All performance studies demonstrated that the Omega assay is in substantial agreement with the Quest Diagnostic product.

Results obtained from donor specimens showed that the qualitative results from the new assays are substantialy equivalent to those obtained from the predicate devices.

# Conclusion:

The Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assay for Methamphetamine and MDMA is substantially equivalent to the Quest Diagnostics HairCheck-DT (Amphetamines) k051161.
