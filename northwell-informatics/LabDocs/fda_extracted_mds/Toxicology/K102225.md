Alco-Breath Tube; CheckPoint $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Breath Alcohol Test

# Common Name:

Devices, Breath trapping, alcohol

Regulation Number and Panel:

862.3050 - Toxicology

Classification Product Code:

DJZ

# Classification:

Class I

Substantially Equivalent Devices:

K060761 - BreathScan Alcohol Detector

# Device Description:

The Alco-Breath Tube is a disposable, one-time use in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device using a length-of-stain method to give estimates of alcohol concentrations. A chemical reaction occurs when the reagent-treated silica gel is exposed to breath alcohol at or greater than the threshold level of the test device. The results are interpreted based on the observation of a color change within a specified period of test time. The color change is proportional to the concentration of alcohol in the breath. The device provides preliminary screening test results and is not intended to be used as evidential results.

The Alco-Breath Tube is intended to detect the presence of alcohol in the breath at concentrations between $0 . 0 2 \mathsf { B r A C }$ (Breath Alcohol Concentration) and 0.08 or $0 . 1 5 \mathrm { B r A C }$ The Alco-Breath Tube is intended for screening in medical and therapeutic programs. This product will also give a semi-quantitative estimate of alcohol levels in these ranges. The Alco-Breath Tube is a disposable device designed for one-time use.

# 510(k) SUMMARY

The CheckPoint $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Breath Alcohol Test is a disposable, one-time use in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device using a color change to indicate the presence of alcohol. A chemical reaction occurs when the reagent-treated silica gel is expoed to breath alcohol at or greater than the threshold level of the test device. The results are interpreted based on the observation of a color change within a specified period of test time. The device provides preliminary screening test results and is not intended to be used as evidential results.

The CheckPoint $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Breath Alcohol Test is intended to detect the presence of alcohol in the breath at a concentration of $0 . 0 2 \%$ or greater. The CheckPoint® comes in four different alcohol levels: $0 . 0 2 \% , 0 . 0 4 \% , 0 . 0 5 \% .$ ,and $0 . 0 8 \%$ . The alcohol level for each device is printed on the label of the device. The CheckPoint $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Breath Alcohol Test are a disposable device designed for one-time use and is intended for screening in medical and therapeutic programs.

Test Summary:

# Performance data - Non-clinical/ Clinical

The conduct of performance evaluation studies is based on the most current National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)/ DOT guidance document. "Highway Safety Programs; Model Specifications for Screening; Devices to Measure Alcohol in Bodily Fluids". (Federal Register: March 31, 2008. Vol 73, No.62, pgs. 16956  16960). This is the only national standard available for alcohol screening devices and is the same standard referenced in the 510(k) clearance for the predicate device. Usability tests were conducted to determine if consumers can correctly perform and interpret tests according to the package insert.

# Performance Specifications

The performance characteristics of the Alco-Breath Tube and CheckPoint® Breath Alcohol Test were based on evaluations by the following analytical performance tests:

Precision/ Reproducibility • Traceability/ Stability/ Expected Values Detection Limit Analytical Specificity 0 cigarette smoke 0 temperature 0 vibration Comparison Studies

Dear Mr. Rucker:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls.
