5.4 Predicate Device:

BreathScan®PRO is equivalent to: Breath Alcohol $| \mathbf { z } | ^ { \mathfrak { Q } }$ .02 Detection System manufactured by ABI (K062971)

# 5.5 Indications for Use

The BreathScan®PRO is an in vitro medical device that quantitatively detects the presence of alcohol in the human breath. The system is used only as a screening device and is an indication of the presence of alcohol in the blood of the test subject.

# 5.6 Description of the device

The BreathScan®PRO is quantitative screening test for alcohol in the human breath and provides a digital readout. The BreathScan®PRO consists of a selfcontained electronic analyzer to quantitatively detect the presence of alcohol in the human breath. The detection level range is from $0 . 0 0 \%$ to $0 . 1 5 \%$ Breath Alcohol concentrations higher than $0 . 1 5 \%$ will be displayed as BAC ${ > } 0 . 1 5 \%$ The electronic Analyzer is factory pre-calibrated and is ready to use when a Detector is fully inserted into the sample port. It is a re-usable device designed for use specifically with BreathScan $\Theta _ { \mathrm { P R O } }$ detectors.

The detectors are disposable screening devices designed for one time use. The BreatScan®RO Electronic Analyzer enables the user o read or interpret the BreathScan®PRO Detectors charged by human breath. The system provides an indication of the possible presence of alcohol in the blood of the test subject.

The detectors contains chemicals that change color in the presence of alcohol vapors) utilizing the patented technology. The Detector consists of two parts. One part is a glass capsule containing light yellow crystals that change color when exposed to alcohol vapors. The other part is a plugged, plastic tube with an opening to blow into while running the test.

When the subject exhales into the tube, the fresh crystals interact with breath vapor and change color from yellow to blue green if alcohol is present. Note: The resulting color change is dependent upon the level of alcohol detected.

The blow bags are re-usable and serve as a method to assure that the subject has blown through the Detector with adequate air. With the BreathScan®PRO, this is required (DOT/NHTSA compliance). ABI provides these in the starter kit and as an option for future orders.

# 5.7 Safety and Effectiveness

The bench test and user testing data indicated that the BreathScan®PRO is safe and effective as an evidentiary breath test, the ALCO SENSOR IV manufactured by Intoximeters, Inc. which is a DOT/NHTSA approved device (Conforming Products List of Evidentiary Breath Measurement Devices - FR/Vol.69, No.134/July 2004/Notices/42237).

User studies were performed to establish that the user could read and understand the directions provided and properly use the devices (Table 1).

Standard Error = 0.01

Additionally, the BreathScan®PRO was evaluated and found to meet the guidelines provided in the DOT/NHTSA Model Specifications for Alcohol Screening Devices -(Federal Register/Vol. 73, No. 62, March 31, 2008/Notices/16956).

# 5.8 Substantial Equivalence

The similarities and differences between the BreathScan®PRO and the Breath Alcohol $\boxed { \pmb { \bigtriangledown } } \mathfrak { Q }$ .02 Detection System is summarized in Table 2.
