# Legally marketed device to which equivalency is claimed:

AxSYM Gentamicin (K935376)

# Intended Use of Device:

The ARCHITECT iGentamicin assay is an in vitro chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) for the quantitative determination of gentamicin, an antibiotic drug, in human serum or plasma on the ARCHITECT i System with STAT protocol capability. The measurements obtained are used in the diagnosis and treatment of gentamicin overdose and in monitoring levels of gentamicin to help ensure appropriate therapy.

# Description of Device:

The ARCHITECT iGentamicin assay is a one-step immunoassay for the quantitative determination of gentamicin in human serum or plasma using CMIA technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex. In the ARCHITECT iGentamicin assay, sample, anti-gentamicin coated paramagnetic microparticles, and gentamicin acridinium-labeled conjugate are combined to create a reaction mixture. The anti-gentamicin coated microparticles bind to the gentamicin present in the sample and to the acridinium-labeled conjugate. After washing, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). An indirect relatinship exists between the amount of gentamicin in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT i System optics.

# Comparison of Technological Characteristics:

The ARCHITECT iGentamicin assay utilizes chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology for the quantitative determination of gentamicin in human serum or plasma. The AxSYM Gentamicin assay utilizes Fluorescence Polarization Immunoassay (FPIA) technology for the quantitative measurement of gentamicin in serum or plasma.

# Summary of Analytical Performance:

The ARCHITECT iGentamicin assay is substantially equivalent to the AxSYM Gentamicin assay in terms of analytical performance data in this 510(k) submission.

The analytical performance of the ARCHITECT iGentamicin assay was demonstrated through the following studies, which are provided in this $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ EY submission:

• Precision   
• Limit of Blank, Limit of Detection, and Limit of Quantitation (Sensitivity)   
• Linearity   
• Interferences Recovery   
• Manual Dilution   
• Matrix Comparison (Tube Type)   
. Method Comparison (Correlation)

Dear Ms. Wallach:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, $1 9 7 6 ,$ the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice. labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

Iyr device is lassie ee bove)into eitherclass I (SpecilControl)or lass II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
