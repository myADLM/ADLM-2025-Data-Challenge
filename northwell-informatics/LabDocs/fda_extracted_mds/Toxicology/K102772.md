# Device Description:

# MPAT

The liqui rents aecoiguredin n ight well "Flx";te ctent h $\operatorname { F l e x } ^ { \mathfrak { O } }$ well is described in the Instructions for Use.

The methodology for the Dimension® MPAT assay is based on a homogenous particle enhanced turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay (PETINIA) technique, which uses a latex particle

mycophenolic acid conjugate (PR) and monoclonal mycophenolic acid specific antibody (Ab). Mycophenolic acid present in the sample competes with the mycophenolic acid on the particles for available antibody, thereby decreasing the rate of aggregation. Hence, the rate of aggregation is inversely proportional to the concentration of mycophenolic acid in the sample. The rate of aggregation is measured using bichromatic turbidimetric readings at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ and $7 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .

The concentration is determined by means of a mathematical function:

Mycophenolic acid $^ +$ $+ \ P R + A b$ EPY -> PR-Ab complex + mycophenolic acid-Ab (scatters light at 340 nm)

To perform the MPAT assay, a sample cup containing the plasma or serum sample to be analyzed and a Dimension® MPAT reagent Flex® Reagent Cartridge are placed appropriately on the Dimension® analyzer.

# Calibrator

The Dimension® MPAT Calibrator is used to calibrate the MPAT assay on the Dimension® system. The calibrator is a five level aqueous BSA matrix product containing Mycophenolic acid. The typical calibration levels for levels 1 through 5 respectively, are 0.0, 0.7, 2.3, 6.7 and $3 0 . 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ .Level 1 is a zero level, and can be used to dilute samples that exceed $3 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

# Intended Use:

# MPAT

The MPAT assay is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of mycophenolic acid (MPA) in human serum and plasma on the Dimension® Clinical Chemistry System. Measurements of MPA are used as an aid in the management of mycophenolic acid therapy in renal, hepatic and cardiac transplant patients.

# Comments on Substantial Equivalence:

Split sample comparison between the Dimension® Mycophenolic Acid $\boldsymbol { \mathsf { F l e x } } ^ { \mathfrak {otimes } }$ Reagent Cartridge and HPLC/LC-MS assays gave the following correlation statistics, when tested with clinical samples from kidney, heart and liver transplant patients:

# Conclusion:

The Dimension® Mycophenolic Acid $\mathbb { F } | \mathrm { e x } ^ { \mathfrak { o } }$ Reagent Cartridge with the associated Dimension® MPAT Calibrator are substantially equivalent in principle and performance to the Roche COBAS INTEGRA system based on the split sample comparison versus HPLC and HPLC/LC-MS reference methods discussed above.
