Predicate Device: At Home Drug Test Models 9308T and 9308Z

Intended Use: The QuickScreen Drug Screening Test System is a rapid, qualitative immunoassay for the detection of amphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, methadone,

methamphetamines, opiates, oxycodone, phencyclidine and THC or their metabolites in urine. This assay is intended to assist in the prevention of drug abuse. The cut-off concentrations of this test are as follows:

<table><tr><td>Analyte</td><td>Calibrator</td><td>Cutoff</td></tr><tr><td>Amphetamine</td><td>d amphetamine</td><td>1000 ng/ml</td></tr><tr><td>Cocaine</td><td>benzoylecgonine</td><td>150 ng/ml</td></tr><tr><td>Methamphetamine</td><td>d methamphetamine</td><td>500 ng/ml</td></tr><tr><td>Opiates</td><td>morphine</td><td>300 ng/ml</td></tr><tr><td>PCP</td><td>phencyclidine</td><td>25 ng/ml</td></tr><tr><td>Barbiturates</td><td>Secobarbital</td><td>200 ng/ml</td></tr><tr><td>Benzodiazepines</td><td>Oxazepam</td><td>200 ng/ml</td></tr><tr><td>Methadone</td><td>Methadone</td><td>300 ng/ml</td></tr><tr><td>Oxycodone</td><td>Oxycodone</td><td>100 ng/ml</td></tr><tr><td>THC</td><td>Cannabinoids</td><td>50 ng/ml</td></tr></table>

The QuickScreen Drug Screening Test System is for in-vitro diagnostic use and is intended for use in point-of-care settings.

Configurations of the QuickScreen Drug Screening Test System may consist of any combination of the above listed and previously cleared drug. Refer to specific product labeling for the combination of drug tests included on that test device.

Similarities and differences to predicate device:

The QuickScreen Drug Screening Test system, ike many commercially available drug screening test kits, qualitatively measures the presence of target drugs or their metabolites by visual color sandwich one step immunoassay technology. Examples of such predicate devices include the Phamatech QuickScreen At Home Drug Test and the Phamatech QuickScreen Pro Multi Drug Screening Test. All of the above devices rely on the basic immunochemical sandwich assay principle of recognition and formation of specific antibody / target drug / antibody / complexes.

The performance characteristics of the QuickScreen Drug Screening Test system for common analytes are exactly the same. They have not been altered by the change in cutoff concentration of the cocaine test.

See k070009 for amphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, methadone, methamphetamines, opiates, oxycodone, phencyclidine and THC or their metabolites. Performance studies were conducted for the change to a 150ng/ml cutoff concentration for cocaine.

The following laboratory_ performance studies were performed to determine substantial equivalence of the QuickScreen Drug Screening Test system to the predicate:

Performance: The performance characteristics of the QuickScreen Drug Screening Test system for common analytes was evaluated in a clinical sample correlation study and a blind labeled spiked study. The results of these studies demonstrate the QuickScreen Drug Screening Test system to be substantially equivalent to the reported performance characteristics of other commercially available tests for the qualitative detection of the stated target drugs in urine.

Method Comparison - The performance of the QuickScreen ™ devices was evaluated with 3 operators who are typical operators at this site. Operators tested 80 unaltered clinical urine samples. The samples were blinded and sufficiently randomized and compared to GC/MS results. The results are presented below:

# INDICATIONS FOR USE

Applicant: Phamatech

510 (k) Number (if known): K 103295.

Device Name: QuickScreen™ Cocaine 150 Test Model 9050T Dip Card and 9051 Cassette

Indications for Use:

The QuickScreen Cocaine 150 Test is an in-vitro diagnostic test for the detection/presence of cocaine (benzoylecgonine) in urine. The cut-off concentration is 150 ng/ml. Measurements obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis and treatment of drug abuse. This test is intended for point-of-care testing.

This test provides only a preliminary test result. A more specific alternate testing method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Other confirmation methods are available. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are observed.
