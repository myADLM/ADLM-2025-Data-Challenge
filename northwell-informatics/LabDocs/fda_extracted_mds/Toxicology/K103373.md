# 5.0 Description:

System reagent for the quantitative determination of Cholinesterase activity (E.C. 3.1.1.8)1 in human serum and plasma on Beckman Coulter Synchron. $\mathtt { C X @ }$ Pro System(s), Synchron $\mathsf { L X @ }$ Pro System(s) and UniCe $\textcircled{8}$ DxC 600/800 System(s)..

A cholinesterase test system is a device intended to measure cholinesterase (an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of acetylcholine to choline) in human specimens. There are two principal types of cholinesterase in human tissues. True cholinesterase is present at nerve endings and in erythrocytes (red blood cells) but is not present in plasma. Pseudo cholinesterase is present in plasma and liver but is not present in erythrocytes. Measurements obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis and treatment of cholinesterase inhibition disorders (e.g., insecticide poisoning and succinylcholine poisoning).

The method is base on the recommendations of the German Society r Clinical Chemisty (Deutsche Gesellschaft fr Klinische Chemie, DGKCh).

Cholinesterase catalyses the hydrolysis of butyrylthiocholine to butyrate and thiocholine. Thiolinducesellwhexcyanoferratcolorlesshexacyanoerrat decrease in absorbance at $4 1 0 \mathsf { n m }$ is directly proportional to the cholinesterase activity in the sample.

# 6.0 Intended Use:

System reagent for the quantitative determination of Cholinesterase activity (E.C. 3.1.1.8) in human serum and plasma on Beckman Coulter Synchron $\tt c { x @ }$ Pro System(s), Synchron $L X @$ Pro System(s) and UniCel@® DxC 600/800 System(s).

Measurements obtained by, this device are used in the diagnosis and treatment of cholinesterase inhibition disorders (e.g., insecticide poisoning and succinylcholine poisoning).

# 8.0 Summary of Performance Data:

The data in the Premarket Notification on safety and effectiveness supports a finding of substantial equivalence to chemistry test systems already in commercial distribution. Equivalence is demonstrated through method comparison, stability, linearity, and imprecision experiments.

Dear Ms. Lloyd:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into class II (Special Controls), it may be subject to such aditional controls.Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Tite 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). ·This letter willallow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
