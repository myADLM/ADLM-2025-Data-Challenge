Code: KLT

ARCHITECT iCarbamazepine Calibrator Kit Classification Name: Calibrators, Drug Specific Trade Name: ARCHITECT iCarbamazepine Common Name: Calibrator

Governing Regulation: 862.3200

Device Classification: Class II

Classification Panel: Clinical Toxicology

Code: DLJ

# Legally marketed device to which equivalency is claimed:

AxSYM Carbamazepine (K935374)

# Intended Use of the Device

The ARCHITECT iCarbamazepine assay is an in vitro chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) for the quantitative measurement of carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant drug, in human serum or plasma (collected in lithium heparin, sodium heparin, dipotassium EDTA or sodium EDTA tubes) on the ARCHITECT i System with STAT protocol capability. The measurements obtained are used in monitoring levels of carbamazepine to help ensure appropriate therapy.

# Description of Device

The ARCHITECT iCarbamazepine assay is a one-step immunoassay for the quantitative measurement of carbamazepine in human serum or plasma using CMIA technology with flexible assay protocols referred to as Chemiflex.

In the ARCHITECT iCarbamazepine assay, sample, anti-carbamazepine coated paramagnetic microparticles, and carbamazepine acridinium-labeled conjugate are combined to create a reaction mixture. The anti-carbamazepine coated microparticles bind to carbamazepine present in the sample and the carbamazepine acridinium-labeled conjugate. After washing, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). An indirect relationship exists between the amount of carbamazepine in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT i System optics.

# Comparison of Technological Characteristics:

The ARCHITECT iCarbamazepine assay utilizes chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology for the quantitative measurement of carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant drug, in human serum or plasma. The AxSYM Carbamazepine assay utilizes Fluorescence Polarization Immunoassay (FPIA) technology for the quantitative measurement of carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant drug, in serum or plasma.

# Summary of Analytical Performance:

The ARCHITECT iCarbamazepine assay is substantially equivalent to the AxSYM Carbamazepine assay in terms of analytical performance data in this 510(k) submission.

The analytical performance of the ARCHITECT iCarbamazepine assay was demonstrated through the following studies, which are provided in this 510(k) submission:

Dear Ms. Wallach

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to markct the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarkel approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the eneral controls provisions of the Ac. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as t forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
