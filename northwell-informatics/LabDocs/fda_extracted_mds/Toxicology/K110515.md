Dear Ms. Chen:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Cocaine   
Marijuana   
Methadone   
Methamphetamine   
MDMA   
Morphine   
Opiate 2000   
Oxycodone   
Phencyclidine   
Tricyclic Antidepressant   
Calibrator   
D-Amphetamine   
Secobarbital   
Oxazepam   
Benzoylecgonine   
Delta-9-THC-COOH   
Methadone   
D-Methamphetamine

The test configuration comes with single drug screening test or any combinations of multiple drug s.Te     e-r u to provide consumers, including but not limited to concerned parents, with information concerning the preenc bsche bove stat ru rhe etabolis   ursamleforatn rei confirmatory testing  the second step in the process, along with the materials for shipping the urine specimen to the laboratory, is provided. The test is also intended for health care professional users.

The tests will yield preliminary positive results when the prescription drugs Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines, Oxycodone, Tricyclic Antidepressants are ingested, even at or above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly recognized drug levels for Barbiturate, Benzodiazepines, Oxycodone, Tricyclic Antidepressant in urine. The tests;ony provide a preliminary analytical test result. A more speciic alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method for most drugs (HPLC is the preferred confirmatory method for Tri-cyclic Antidepressants). Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated. The tests are not intended to be used in monitoring drug levels.
