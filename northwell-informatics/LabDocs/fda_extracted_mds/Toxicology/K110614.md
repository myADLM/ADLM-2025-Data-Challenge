Equivalent legally marketed devices Model:AL2500 K Number: K053332

.Indication for use (Intended use): The PAD Breath Alcohol Tester is a screening device for the rapid detection of alcohol in the human breath. Measurements obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis of alcoholic intoxication.

Intended use is the same as the predicate device

Description of the Device:

The PAD is a self-contained unit with 3 digit LCD display, and power button. The 3 digit LCD display window displays the alcohol concentration in increment of $0 . 0 1 \%$ . The display is also capable of displaying L-b, S-E, t-F, L-t, n-C, HI and these states low battery, sensor error, test fail, low temperature, need calibration ,high concentration, respectively. The unit is powered by two AAA batteries.

5.Safety and Effectiveness, comparison to predicate device

The results of bench and user testing indicate that the new device is as safe and effective as the predicate device. A clinical trial was performed to establish that the user could read and understand the instructions provided, and properly use the device, as well as perform comparably to an evidentiary type of breath alcohol tester.

# 7. Conclusion

After analyzing bench test, a risk analysis, EMC and user testing data, it is the conclusion of SEJU Engineering Col, Ltd. that the PAD is as safe and effective as the predicate device, has few technological differences, and has no new indications for use, thus rendering it substantially equivalent to the predicate device. The clinical trial performed showed that the over the counter purchaser of this device could read and understand the instructions, could properly use the device, and obtain results that were comparable to those provided by a professional unit administered by a trained observer.

# Instructions for Use

# Model: PAD

The PAD Breath Alcohol Test System is a screening device for the rapid detection of alcohol in the human breath. Measurements obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis of alcohol intoxication. The accuracy of this deyice has been established at a Blood Alcohol Concentrations of 0.008 and $0 . 0 3 2 \%$ BAC. Accuracy at a Blood Alcohol Concentration greater than $0 . 0 3 2 \%$ has not been established.

The Personal Alcohol Detector PAD analyzes a breath sample to detect alcohol in the lungs. This reading is then converted to blood alcohol concentration (BAC). This device is designed for over-the-counter use. No mouthpiece is required.

# CAUTION

PAD is a screening device. Each individual's body responds differently to alcohol. Driving skills may be impaired at a level below the legal blood alcohol limit. Do not rely on results to determine level of intoxication or ability to safely operate a

vehicle or machinery.   
In addition, since this device visually shows the result on the Display Window, it is not appropriate for visually impaired people.

# 1. Operation

Make sure that you wait at least 25 minutes after drinking alcohol, smoking, or eating before testing. Please followed test procedure step 1\~step3.

# Power On/Off_ and Self test function.

Press Power button, and the device will start the self-test function to check battery and sensor. During the self-test function, Display Window will show the count-down from ${ \bf \nabla } \cdot _ { \bf l 0 0 } \bf \cdot \mathrm { }$ to ${ \bf \sqrt [ 4 ] { \alpha } }$ with "WAIT" message. The self-test function typically lasts about 20 seconds. If it is normal at self-test function, the procedure will go to step 2. In the case of abnormal condition, the messages "L-b"(Low Battery) or "S-E"(Sensor damaged) will be display on the Display Window with a beep sound. And then, the device will turn off automatically.

# Breath Sample

It is important that to blow properly to inhaler to test blood alcohol concentration (BAC).

a. When you push power button, Display Window show number that how many you tested and then display "Wait" and countdown $" 1 0 0 "$ to $" 0 "$

b. When "O" and "BLOW" appear on the Display Window with a beep sound, blow your deep breath constantly into inhaler for 3-4 seconds.

c. After you finished blow breath, the unit will beep again when display blood alcohol concentration.(BAC)

d. If you don't blow within 20 seconds, the unit will turn off automatically with a beep sound.

# Display

After the breath sample analyzed, the test result appears as percent measure of

<table><tr><td></td><td>blood alcohol concentration (BAC) from 0.00% to 0.20 % on the Display Window. The BAC will be displayed for 20 seconds. And then, the device will turn off automatically.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>If you want to repeat test, start again from Step 1 to Step 3.</td></tr></table>

# 2. Interpretation of the results

The generally accepted legal standard for alcohol intoxication in United States is

0.08 $\%$ BAC. However, your driving skills can be impaired even at a level of

0.03%BAC or lower. It is never safe to drink any amount of alcohol and drive. We recommend you "Don't drink and drive".

•The result is displayed on the LCD screen by the increments of 0.01%BAC totally in 21 stages from $0 . 0 0 \% \mathrm { B A C }$ to 0.20 %BAC. If alcohol concentration is above 0.20 %BAC, the message "HI" (high) will display.

# 5. Warnings.

a. Do NOT drop. This may damage the device, causing it not to work.

b. Do NOT tamper with the device. It may cause malfunction.

c. Please WAIT to test at least 25 minutes after drinking alcohol, smoking or eating.

Otherwise, the remaining alcohol and smellin the mouth may lead to inaccuracy

d. Do not blow smoke, saliva, or other contaminants into inhaler, as the sensor may be damaged.

e. Do not use it as a means to drink and drive.

f. Do NOT keep the device in a dusty place. Dust accumulation on the PAD may cause

# problems

g. Do NOT use or keep the device in a place where there are heavy moisture or traces o solvents such as Acetone. This may lead to malfunction.

h. Keep out of extreme temperature and out of reach of children.

i YOU SHOULD HAVE YOUR PAD CALIBRATED EVERY 6 MONTHS OR AFTER 200 TESTS. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY CAUSE YOUR READINGS TO BE INACCURATE. To obtain accuracy, the PAD requires recalibration every six months or after two hundred tests which comes first.
