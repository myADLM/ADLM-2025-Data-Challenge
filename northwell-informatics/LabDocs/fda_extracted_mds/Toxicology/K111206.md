# H. Intended Use:

2. Indication(s) for use:

The Teco Saliva Alcohol Test is a semi-quantitative screening test for measuring alcohol in human saliva. This strip specifies the relative Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) at $0 . 0 \%$ $0 . 0 2 \%$ $0 . 0 4 \%$ $0 . 0 8 \%$ , and $0 . 3 0 \%$ cut-off levels. Results can be used for the indication of alcohol intoxication. For in vitro diagnostic use only.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): The assay is a disposable test for one-time use. The strip is for over-the-counter use.

I. Device Description:

The Teco Saliva Alcohol Test is used to detect the amount of alcohol in the saliva after consumption.This is a semi-quantitative test that is read visually.The test strip determines the relative Blood Alcohol Concentration at 5 cut-off levels (negative, 0.02%, 0.04%, 0.08% and $0 . 3 \%$ The device consists of a test srip (1 test strip per foil pouch). The resultant color on the test strip is compared to the color blocks printed on the pouch.

J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

1. Predicate device name(s): Mission Saliva Alcohol Test; Acon Inc.

# K. Test Principle:

The Teco Saliva Alcohol Test is a plastic strip tipped with a reactive pad containing tetramethylbenzidine, alcohol oxidase, and peroxidase. The test is utilizes two coupled enzymatic reactions to create the visual changes in the presence of varying amounts of saliva alcohol. The first reaction consists of an oxidation reaction where the ethanol in the saliva is converted to aldehyde by the alcohol oxidase. The second reaction is the oxidation of TMB, the color indicator substrate, and is catalyzed by the enzyme peroxidase.The color change of the pad corresponds to the amount o present alcohol in the sample.The results are read by comparing the colored pad to the color chart found on the strip package

# 005 - 510(k) Summary

Clinical study results indicate that the intended users were able to obtain comparable testing data when using the Teco Saliva Alcohol Test and the legally marketable ACON Mission Saliva Alcohol test.

# M. Conclusion:

The performance characteristics of the Teco Saliva Alcohol Test were verified using method comparison, precision, linearity, shelf life, and stress studies. Testing results indicate that the Teco Saliva Alcohol Test compared with the ACON Mission Saliva Alcohol tests perform satisfactorily when used appropriately, as outlined in the package insert. The clinical studies results demonstrate a substantial equivalency on performance between Teco Saliva Alcohol Test with predicate test, ACON Mission Alcohol Saliva test.
