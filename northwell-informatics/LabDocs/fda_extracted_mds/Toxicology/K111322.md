# Proposed Labeling or Promotional Material for the Device:

A description of the device can be found in the attached proposed labeling, including an explanation of how the device functions, technical principle and concepts that form the basis for the device, as well as the physical and performance characteristics of the device, such as the device design, materials used and physical properties. In accordance with FDA labeling requirements (21 CFR 809.10), enclosed are the draft copies of product labeling including copies of the technical product inserts. See ATTACHMENT B, C and D.

# Intended Use

The Chemtrue® test device is intended for the qualitative detection of drugs of abuse, for in vitro diagnostic use and for prescription use ONLY.

The test provides only a preliminary result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed assay result. Gas Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) are the preferred confirmatory methods.

Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drugs of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.

# Technological Characteristics and Scientific Principles

The Drugs of Abuse (DOA) Screen Panels are one-step lateral flow immunoassays in which chemically modified drugs (drug-protein conjugates) compete for limited antibody binding sites with drugs that may be present in urine. The test device consists of up to six test strips placed into separate panels of a plastic holder. On each test strip, a drug-protein conjugate is striped on the test band of the membrane - known as the test region (T) and the anti-drug antibody-colloidal gold conjugate pads are placed at the forward end of the membrane. In the absence of drugs in the urine, the solution of the colored antibodycolloidal gold conjugates moves along with the sample solution by capillary action across the membrane to the immobilized drug-protein conjugate zone on the test band region. The colored antibody-gold conjugates then complexes with the drug-protein conjugates to form visible lines. Therefore, the formation of the visible precipitant in the test band occurs when the test urine is negative for the drug. If any of the subject drugs of abuse is present in the urine, the drug/metabolite antigen competes with drug-protein conjugates on the test band region for the limited antibody on the colored drug antibody-colloidal gold conjugate pad. When a sufficient amount of drug is present in the urine, the drug will saturate the limited antibody binding sites and the colored antibody -colloidal gold conjugate cannot bind to the drug-protein conjugate at the test region of the test strip. Therefore, absence of the color band on the test region indicates a preliminary positive result.

A control band with a different antigen/antibody reaction is added to the membrane strip at the control region (C) to indicate that the test has performed properly. This control line is manufactured as a built-in internal control of the test device and should always appear regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite. If the control line does not appear the test should be discarded. The presence of this colored band in the control region also serves: 1) as verification that adequate specimen volume is added, or no flow, due to insufficient urine volume, 2) to indicate that the test device is properly functioning, and 3) as an internal quality control of the system.

# Summary of Device Similarities and Differences

Chemtron Biotech, Inc.'s Chemtrue® Single/Multi-Panel Drug Screen Cassette and Dip Card tests are similar to other FDA-cleared devices for the qualitative detection of drugs of abuse: Benzodiazepines, Barbiturates, Ecstasy (MDMA), Opiates (Morphine) 2000, Methadone and Oxycodone test from other manufacturers such as ACON (Alere), Alfa Scientific Designs, Inc. All of these products are based on the same technological characteristics, scientific principle and similar procedures. The similarities and differences among these tests are summarized as follows:

# DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION:

Based on the technological characteristics/assay principle, features of the device designs, test specimen matrix, test method and performance characterizations, as the set forth above, it can be concluded that Chemtrue® Single/ Multi-Panel Drug Screen tests are substantially equivalent to the predicate kit ACON's (INNOVACON/Alere) One Step Single and Multi Drug Screen test card product which is currently distributed commercially.

The Chemtrue® Drug Screen Tests do not require pre-treatment for urine specimen, thereby making it much simpler and convenient for the intended user. With regarding to the difference of Time to read result, since the device labeling clearly indicates the required "Read Time", it does not impact the result interpretation by the intended user.

# Performance Data:

Chemtron Biotech, Inc. has reviewed the requirements of Section 514 of the Act, which states that to date no performance standards has been established for drug screen test systems by the FDA.

However, the studies listed in the notification are conducted according to "The Draft Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff' - " Premarket Submission and Labeling Recommendations for Drugs of Abuse Screening Tests, issued on: December 2, 2003", including the design of draft labeling and package inserts.

Chemtrue® Single / Multi-Panel Drug Screen Cassette and Dip Card tests are one-step, lateral flow, colloidal gold based immunoassays for the rapid, qualitative detection of Benzodiazepines, Barbiturates, Ecstasy (MDMA), Opiates (Morphine) 2000, Methadone and Oxycodone in human urine. They are intended for Professional Use and Prescription Use ONLY.

For BAR or BZO test, it may yield preliminary positive results when BAR or BZO is ingested at or above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly recognized drug levels for barbiturate and benzodiazepine in urine. The Chemtrue® Single / Multi-Pane drugs of abuse urine test device shows the drug was or was not present at the cutoff level.

The assay provides a preliminary test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed assay result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory result. Clinical and professional judgment must be applied to any drugs of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are obtained.

# Conclusion:

The product performance characteristics of were evaluated with the GC/MS confirmed values in a blind-labeled clinical specimen correlation study. The results of these studies demonstrate Chemtrue® Single/ Multi-Panel Drug Screen Test to be substantially in agreement with the GC/MS assigned values.

Additionally, the Chemtrue® Single/ Multi-Panel Drug Screen tests were shown to be equivalent, when compared to the data in the package insert of the predicate kit ACON (INNOVACON/Alere) One Step Drug Screen test card. These results demonstrated that Chemtrue® Single/ Multi-panel Drug Screen cassette and Dip Card are safe and effective in detecting Benzodiazepines, Barbiturates, Ecstasy (MDMA), Methadone, Opiates (Morphine) 2000 and Oxycodone in human urine.

Other non-clinical performance data, such as cutoff characteristics, precision (Reproducibility), specificity (Cross-reactivity and interference) and stability studies are summarized in the Section labeled "Performance Characteristics" and the raw data are enclosed in ATTACHMENT E and ATTACHMENT H of this submission.
