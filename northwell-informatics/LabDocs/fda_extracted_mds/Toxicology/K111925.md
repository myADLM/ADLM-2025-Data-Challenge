Psychemedics Microplate EIA for Cocaine in Hair

Predicate Device:

Psychemedics Cocaine Assay, k010868

Product Code:

JXO

Device Classification/Name:

21 CFR 862.3250, Enzyme Immunoassay, Cocaine;   
Classification II;

Intended Use:

The Psychemedics Microplate EIA for Cocaine is an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the preliminary qualitative detection of cocaine in human head and body hair samples using a cocaine calibrator at $5 \ \mathfrak { n g }$ $/ 1 0 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ hair cutoff for the purpose of identifying cocaine usc. This product is intended exclusively for in-house professional use only and not for sale to anyone.

The Psychemedics EIA Cocaine Assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. To obtain a quantitative analytical result or to confirm positive results, a more specific alternate chemical method (e.g. GC/MS) must be used. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to the interpretation of any drug-of-abuse test result..

# Assay Description:

The test consists of two parts; a pre-analytical hair treatment procedure (to convert the solid matrix of hair to a measurable liquid matrix) and the screening assay, the Psychemedics Microplate ElA for Cocaine. The. drug is recovered from the hair using a patented method (U.S. Patent #8,084,215). The screening portion of the test system consists of (1) microplate wells coated with multiple drugs including benzoylecgonine conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) (patent pending), monoclonal mouse anti-cocaine, goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to HRP (horseradish peroxidase), substrate $[ 3 , 3 ^ { \prime } , 5 , 5 ^ { \prime }$ tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)], HCl to acidify the final reaction, and wash buffer for washing the plates. Absorbance in the wells is read with a microplate reader.

Sample Collection:

A sample of hair should be cut as close as possible to the skin. The hair is placed in a V-shaped aluminum foil sample holder with the root end of the hair protruding beyond the slanted edge of the foil. The aluminum foil is crimped around the sample, securing the hair specimen firmly into place within the foil. The hair sample crimped within the foil is placed in a sample acquisition card envelope and the envelope is sealed with a tamper-evident seal. Hair specimens are kept al ambient temperature in a secure location until they are shipped without refrigeration to the laboratory.

Materials required:

Hair sample collection kit, Microplate EIA for Cocaine, Microplate washer and reader, LC/MS/MS for confirmation.

# Agreement Testing

Four hundred-twenty-five hair samples were assayed by the predicate device and by the Psychemedics Cocaine ElA. Four samples near the cutoff and positive with the predicate device were negative with the EIA device and by LC/MS/MS. The discordance between EIA and RIA was $< 1 \%$ .Of the total samples, $1 5 . 8 \%$ were body hair samples.

Samples vary in the amount o contamination on the surface; infact, contamination is, byits very nature, no  he way  which it may preen on the hair smplThereore, it s not surprisng that a le might be positive in one screening assay and not in the next, even if the assays are the same technology. The samples were negative by LC/MS/MS, demonstrating that the EIA negative results, although discordant with the predicate, are correct.

Cosmetic Treatment Study

Twenty cocaine-negative hair samples were treated with bleach, 20 with permanent wave, 20 with dye, 20 with relaxer, and 20 with shampoo, and the results compared to the same samples without the treatments. In each case of the 20 samples treated with a type of cosmetic treatment, 10 samples were treated with one brand of a particular product and 10 other samples with a second brand. No significant differences were observed for the negative hair samples before and after the treatments; all samples remained negativeter the treatments.

Twelve cocaine-positive hair samples were treated with bleach, 12 with permanent wave, 12 with dye, 12 with relaxer, and 12 with shampoo, and the results compared to the same samples without the treatments. In cach case of the 12 samples treated with a type of cosmetic treatment, 6 samples were treated with one brand of a particular product and 6 other samples with a second brand. The means and ranges of the ElA results of the 12 samples before and after the cosmetic treatments are shown in the table below. No positive samples became negative after the cosmetic treatments.

# Contamination Study

Potential environmental contamination of samples that are identified as presumptive positive in the screening assay is addressed by an extensive washing procedure prior to confirmation and application of a wash criterion following confirmation, as described below.

Contamination of 8 hair samples by soaking in 1000 ng cocaine $/ \mathrm { m L }$ of water resulted in a range of cocaine on the hair of 38.6 to 98.7 ng of cocaine $/ 1 0 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ hair before washing. After washing by the procedure described below, the amount of cocaine remaining on the hair samples ranged from 1.1 to 3.0 ${ \mathfrak { n g } } / 1 0 ~ { \mathfrak { m } } \mathrm { g }$ hair, with no samples at or above the cutoff even before application of the wash criterion.

Contamination of 8 hair samples by soaking in $1 0 0 0 { \mathfrak { n } } \mathfrak { g }$ cocaine $/ \mathrm { m L }$ of saline resulted in a range of cocaine on the hair of 8.5 to $2 9 . 3 ~ \mathsf { n g }$ of cocaine $/ 1 0 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ hair before washing. After washing by the procedure described below, the amount of cocaine remaining on the hair samples ranged from 0.2 to 1.0 ${ \mathfrak { n g } } / 1 0 ~ { \mathfrak { m g } }$ hair, with all samples negative (i.e., below the cutoff) even without application of the wash criterion.

# The Wash Procedure

a. Wash by Psychemedics' standard wash procedure:

i. Add $2 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of dry isopropanol and shake in waterbath for 15 minutes at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with shaking $@ 1 0 0 \cdot 1 2 0$ oscillations/minute. Remove isopropanol.   
ii. Add $2 \mathrm { m L }$ of Wash Buffer (0.01 M phosphate buffer, $\mathsf { p H } 6 . 0$ , containing $0 . 1 \%$ BSA) and shake in waterbath for 30 minutes at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with shaking $@$ 100 -120 oscillations/minute. Remove Buffer.   
iii. Repeat Step ii. two more times.   
iv. Add $2 \ \mathrm { m L }$ of Wash Buffer, and shake in waterbath for 6Ominutes at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with shaking $@ 1 0 0 \cdot 1 2 0$ oscillations/minute. Remove Buffer.   
v. Repeat Step iv. one more time. Remove Buffer. Save last wash buffer.

b. Analyze last wash for cocaine.

# Confirmation and Interpretation

c. Perform confirmation procedures for cocaine and metabolites. d. Calculate wash criterion:

i. Multiply the last wash value x 5.

ii. Subtract the value of the drug in the last wash from the value of the parent drug in the digested hair.

iii.If the result is less than the cutoff for the parent drug, the sample is interpreted as contaminated. If the result is $\geq$ the parent drug cutoff, in combination with other metabolite criteria, the sample is interpreted as positive due to ingestion. The parent-drug cutoff value for cocaine is $5 \mathrm { n g / 1 0 \mathrm { m g } }$ hair.

Cross-reactivity and Interference Studies

Seven compounds, shown in the table below, showed cross-reactivity in the Cocaine assay. Seventynine other compounds showed no cross-reactivity in the assay. One-hundred-forty-one compounds tested for interference at $+ / { - 5 0 \% }$ of the cutoff showed no interference in the assay.

The cocaine calibratorand control solutions are prepared in-house by the laboratory rom certifid standrs.   
Stability of cocaine in methanol in the presence of other drugs of abuse was shown to exceed 1 year.

Recovery Study

Recovery of cocaine and benzoylecgonine from ha o cocaine users was shown to be substantially equivalent to that of the predicate device.

Conclusion:

The Psychemedics Microplate EIA for Cocaine in Hair is substantially equivalent to the predicate device K010868, and the results are substantially equivalent to LC/MS/MS results.
