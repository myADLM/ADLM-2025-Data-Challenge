Device Trade Name:

Psychemedics Microplate EIA for Opiates in Hair

Predicate Device:

Psychemedics Opiates Assay, k000851

# Product Code:

DJG

Device Classification/Name:

21 CFR 862.3650, Enzyme Immunoassay, Opiates;   
Classification II;

Intended Use:

The Psychemedics Microplate EIA for Opiates is an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the preliminary qualitative detection of opiales in human head and body hair using a morphine calibrator at $2 ~ \mathrm { n g } \ : / 1 0 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ E hair cutoff for the purpose of identifying opiate use. This is an in vitro diagnostic device intended exclusively for Psychemedics use only and is not intended for sale to anyone.

The Psychemedics Microplate EIA opiate assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas or Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS or LC/MS or LC/MS/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.

# Assay Description:

The test consists of two parts; a pre-analytical hair treatment procedure (to convert the solid matrix of hair to a measurable liquid matrix) and the screening assay, the Psychemedics Microplate EIA for Opiates. The drug is recovered from the hair using a patented method (U.S. Patent #8,084,215).The screening portion of the test system consists of (1) microplate wells coated with multiple drugs including morphine   
conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) (patent pending), polyclonal sheep anti-morphine, rabbit anti-goat secondary antibody conjugated to HRP (horseradish peroxidase), substrate $[ 3 , 3 ^ { \prime } , 5 , 5 ^ { \prime }$   
tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)], HCl to acidify the final reaction, and wash buffer for washing the plates. Absorbance in the wells is read with a microplate reader.

# Sample Collection:

A sample of hair should be cut as close as possible to the skin. The hair is placed in a V-shaped aluminum foil sample holder with the root end of the hair protruding beyond the slanted edge of the foil. The aluminum

foil is crimped around the sample, securing the hair specimen firmly into place within the foil. The hair samples crimped within the foil is placed in a sample acquisition card envelope and the envelope is sealed with a tamper-evident seal. Hair specimens are kept at ambient temperature in a secure location until they are shipped without refrigeration to the laboratory.

Materials required:

Hair sample collection kit, Microplate EIA for Opiates, Microplate washer and reader, LC/MS/MS for confirmation.

# Agreement Testing

The agreement studies included 383 head hair samples and 90 body hair samples. Four hundred-seventythree hair samples were assayed by the predicate device and by the Psychemedics Opiates ElA. The discordance between EIA and RIA was $< 0 . 2 \%$ .

Two-hundred fifty-three of the samples were confirmed by LC/MS/MS, with the results shown in the following table.

Samples varyin the amount contamination n he surfac; in fact,contaminatin is, by it very aue, random in the way in which it may present on the hair sample. Therefore, it is not surprising that a sample might be positive in one screening assay and not in the next, even if the assays are the samc technology. The samples were negative by LC/MS/MS, demonstrating that the EIA negative results, although discordant with the predicate, are correct.

# Cosmetic Treatments

Twenty opiate-negative hair samples were treated with bleach, 20 with permanent wave, 20 with dye, 20 with relaxer, and 20 with shampoo, and the results compared to the same samples without the treatments. In each case of the 20 samples treated with a type of cosmetic treatment, 10 samples were treated with one brand of a particular product and 10 other samples with a second brand. No significant differences were observed for the negative hair samples before and after the treatments; all samples remained negative after the treatments.

Twelve opiate-positive hair samples were treated with bleach, 12 with permanent wave, 12 with dye, 12 with relaxer, and 12 with shampoo, and the results compared to the same samples without the treatments. In each case of the 12 samples treated with a type of cosmetic treatment, 6 samples were treated with one brand of a particular product and 6 other samples with a second brand.

Summary of Contamination Study

Potential environmental contamination of samples that are identified as presumptive positive in the screening assay is addressed by an extensive washing procedure prior to confirmation and application of a wash criterion following confirmation, as described below.

Contamination of 8 hair samples by soaking in $1 0 0 0 \cdot \tt N g$ morphine $/ \mathrm { m L }$ of water resulted in a range of morphine on the hair of 67.9 to 265.2 ng of morphine $/ 1 0 m \mathbf { g }$ hair before washing. After washing by the procedure described below, the amount of morphine remaining on the hair samples ranged from 0.8 to 3.4 ${ \mathfrak { n g } } / 1 0 ~ { \mathfrak { m g } }$ hair, with 5 samples appearing to be positive before application of the wash criterion. After application of the wash criterion (see below), all of these samples containing morphine above the culoff were determined to be contaminated rather than positive and would not be reported as positive samples.

Contamination of 8 hair samples by soaking in $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g }$ morphine $/ \mathrm { m L }$ of saline resulted in a range of morphine on the hair of 9.6 to 61.1 ng of morphine $/ 1 0 \ m g$ hair before washing. After washing by the Psychemedics hair washing procedure described below, the amount of morphine remaining on the hair samples ranged from 0.3 to $1 . 3 ~ \mathrm { n g } / 1 0 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ hair, with all samples negative (i.e., below the cutoff) even without application of the wash criterion.

# The Wash Procedure

a. Wash by Psychemedics' standard wash procedure:

i. Add $2 \mathrm { m L }$ of dry isopropanol and shake in waterbath for 15 minutes at $3 7 ^ { \circ } C$ with shaking $@ 1 0 0 - 1 2 0$ oscillations/minute. Remove isopropanol.   
ii. Add $2 \mathrm { m L }$ of Wash Buffer (0.01 M phosphate buffer, $\tt p H 6 . 0$ ,containing $0 . 1 \%$ BSA) and shake in waterbath for 30 minutes at $3 7 \%$ with shaking $@ 1 0 0 - 1 2 0$ EPY oscillations/minute. Remove Buffer.   
iii. Repeat Step ii. two more times.   
iv. Add $^ { 2 } \mathrm { m L }$ of Wash Buffer, and shake in waterbath for 6Ominutes at $3 7 \%$ with shaking $@$ 100 -120 oscillations/minute. Remove Buffer.   
v. Repeat Step iv. one more time. Remove Buffer. Save Wash.

b. Analyze last wash for opiates.

# Confirmation and Interpretation

a. Perform confirmation procedures for opiates. b. Calculate wash criterion:

i. Multiply the last wash value $\texttt { x 5 }$ .   
ii. · Subtract the value of the parent drug in the last wash from the value   
of the parent drug in the digested hair.   
iii. If the result is less than the cutoff for the parent drug, the sample is interpreted as contaminated. If the result is $\geq$ the parent drug cutoff, in combination with other metabolite criteria, the sample is interpreted as positive due to ingestion. The   
confirmation cutoff values for the opiates is $2 \mathrm { n g } / 1 0 \mathrm { m g }$ hair.

Summary of Cross-reactivity and Interference Studies
