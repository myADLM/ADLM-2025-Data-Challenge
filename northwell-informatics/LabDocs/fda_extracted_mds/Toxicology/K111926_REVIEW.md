# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indications for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use:

The Psychemedics Microplate EIA for Opiates is an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the preliminary qualitative detection of opiates in human head and body hair using a morphine calibrator at $2 \mathrm { n g } / 1 0 \mathrm { m g }$ hair cutoff for the purpose of

identifying opiate use. This is an in vitro diagnostic device intended exclusively for Psychemedics use only and is not intended for sale to anyone.

The Psychemedics Microplate EIA for Opiates assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas or Liquid   
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS or LC/MS or LC/MS/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

This assay is for over the counter use.

4. Special instrument requirements:

The device is for use with a microplate reader capable of measuring at 450 and $6 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . Plate washing also requires an instrument specifically designed to effectively and reproducibly wash all wells uniformly.

# I. Device Description:

The test consists of two parts; a pre-analytical hair treatment procedure (to convert the solid matrix of hair to a measurable liquid matrix) and the screening assay, the Psychemedics Microplate EIA for Opiates. The drug is recovered from the hair using a patented method. The screening portion of the test system consists of (1) microplate wells coated with multiple drugs including morphine conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA), polyclonal sheep anti-morphine, rabbit anti-goat secondary antibody conjugated to HRP (horseradish peroxidase), substrate $[ 3 , 3 ^ { \prime } , 5 , 5 ^ { \prime }$ tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)], HCl to acidify the final reaction, and wash buffer for washing the plates. Absorbance in the wells is read with a microplate reader.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced.

# L. Test Principle:

Hair sample extracts and primary antibody are combined in the wells and incubated. After washing, secondary antibody-HRP is added and incubated. After washing, substrate is added, and, after a final incubation, the wells are acidified and read with the microplate reader. Results are normalized by expression as $\mathrm { B } / \mathrm { B } 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 0$ . If morphine or related opiates are present in the sample, less primary antibody will be bound to the solid-phase antigen, thereby resulting in less binding of HRP-labeled secondary antibody; the absorbance produced is inversely proportional to the amount of opiates in the sample (specimen, calibrator or control).

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were performed by taking commercially available materials consisting of morphine in methanol, to prepare spiking solutions at the following concentrations; negative, $\pm 7 5 \%$ , $\pm 5 0 \%$ , $\pm 2 5 \%$ and $100 \%$ of the cutoff. The concentration of each sample was confirmed by LC/MS/MS. The morphine solutions were then used to spike 15 replicates of negative hair samples. Intra-assay precision was performed in one run and inter-assay precision was performed over 5 non-consecutive days. The results are presented in the tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable. This is a qualitative assay.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Psychemedics manufactures calibrators and control materials using drug stocks purchased from a commercial vendor. Each lot of drug is received with its specific certificate of analysis. The commercially obtained stock is made into the calibrators and controls to the desired concentrations. The concentrations are confirmed by GC/MS.

Stability studies for both controls and calibrators have been conducted.

Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims the following expiration date for both controls and calibrators:

When stored at less than or equal to $1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ product is stable for 12 months.

d. Detection limit:

Not required since this is a qualitative test e. Analytical specificity:

Cross-reactivity was established by spiking various concentrations of each substance into drug-free sample and evaluating the result against the cutoff control.

Results are expressed as the concentration of compound required to produce a response approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay. The results are presented in the table below:

Cosmetic Treatment

Tests were performed to determine the effects of various hair treatments (i.e. bleaching, dyeing, relaxer, shampoo, permanent) on samples tested using the Psychemedics Microplate EIA for Opiates. The ethnic origin, hair color and curvature were documented.

Effects on Positive Samples:

60 specimens determined to be positive for opiate were used in the study. The study was conducted with two different hair treatments.

Six different hair samples were used for each hair treatment. ELSIA absorbance readings before and after treatment were compared. Average changes in absorbance values after were $- 2 . 2 5 \%$ for bleach, $- 4 . 6 5 \%$ for dye, - $4 . 5 \%$ for perm, $- 3 . 1 5 \%$ for relaxer and $1 . 1 \%$ for shampoo, where a negative sign indicates a sample becoming “more negative” due to treatment an a positive sign indicates a sample becoming “more positive.” None of the positive samples became negative after treatment.

Effect on Negative Samples:

One hundred specimens previously determined to be negative were used in the study. The study was conducted with two different hair treatments. Ten different hair samples were used for each hair treatment. ELSIA absorbance readings before and after treatment were compared. All samples determined to be negative prior to treatment remained negative post treatment

Environmental Study:

Preliminary positive hair sample results by the screening method could be due to environmental contamination. All positive should be sent for confirmation testing on a reference method to distinguish between true positive and those samples that were positive due to external exposure.

f. Assay cut-off:

Analytical performance of the device around the claimed cutoff is described in precision section M.1a above

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:
