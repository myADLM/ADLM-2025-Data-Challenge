Device Classification/Name:

21 CFR 862.3870, Enzyme Immunoassay, Cannabinoids;   
Classification II;

Intended Use:

The Psychemedics Microplate EIA for Cannabinoids in Hair is an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the preliminary qualitative detection of cannabinoids in human head and body hair samples using a 11- nor-9-Carboxy- $\Delta ^ { 9 }$ THC calibrator at $1 0 \mathrm { p g } / 1 0 \mathrm { m g }$ hair cutoff for the purpose of identifying marijuana use. This is an in vitro diagnostic device intended exclusively for Psychemedics use only and is not intended for sale to anyone.

The Psychemedics Chemiluminscent Microplate EIA for Cannabinoids assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.

# Assay Description:

The EIA screening test consists of two parts; a pre-analytical hair treatment procedure to recover the cannabinoids from the hair and the screening assay, the Psychemedics Chemiluminescent EIA for Cannabinoids in Hair. The device comprises a white microplate coated with the antigen (11-nor-9-carboxy-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol) conjugated to BSA, polyclonal rabbit anticannabinoid antibody, goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to HRP (horseradish peroxidase), a chemiluminescent substrate, and platewashing buffer.

A sample of hair should be cut as close as possible to the skin. The hair is placed in a V-shaped aluminum foil sample holder with the root end of the hair protruding beyond the slanted edge of the foil. The aluminum foil is crimped around the sample, securing the hair specimen firmly into place within the foil. The hair sample crimped within the foil is placed in a sample acquisition card envclope and the envelope is sealed with a tamper-evident seal. Hair specimens are kept at ambient temperaturc in a secure location until they are shipped without refrigeration to the laboratory.

# Materials required:

Hair sample collection kit, Chemiluminescent Microplate EIA for Cannabinoids, Microplate washer and reader, GC/MS/MS for confirmation.

# Cosmetic Treatment

Twenty cannabinoid-negative hair samples were treated with bleach, 20 with permanent wave, 20 with dye, 20 with relaxer, and 20 with shampoo, and the results compared to the same samples without the treatments. In cach case of the 20 samples treated with a type of cosmetic treatment, 10 samples were treated with one brand of a particular product and 10 other samples with a second brand. No significant differences were observed for the negative hair samples before and after the treatments; all negative samples remained negative after the treatments.

Twelve cannabinoid-positive hair samples were treated with bleach, 12 with permanent wave, 12 with dye, 12 with relaxer, and 12 with shampoo, and the results compared to the same samples without the treatments. In each case of the 12 samples treated with a type of cosmetic treatment, 6 samples were treated with one brand of a particular product and 6 other samples with a second brand. The average of the EIA $\mathrm { B } / \mathrm { B } _ { 0 } \times 1 0 0$ values obtained for the 12 positive samples in each set before treatment is shown, with the range following in parenthesis. In the second row of the table, the average of the EIA $\mathsf { B } / \mathsf { B } _ { 0 } \times 1 0 0$ values obtained for the samples in each set after treatment is shown, with the range following in parenthesis. No positive samples became negative in the EIA after the cosmetic treatments.

Contamination Study

Potential environmental contamination of samples that are identified as presumptive positive in the screening assay is addressed by GC/MS/MS confirmation analysis for the Carboxy-THC metabolite and an extensive washing procedure prior to confirmation.

Twelve hair samples ranging in color from light brown to black, with one red hair, were contaminated with smoke from a marijuana cigarette. Two days after the exposure the unwashed samples were analyzed by the Cannabinoid EIA assay and by GC/MS/MS for THC and Carboxy-THC. All of these smokecontaminated samples were positive in the Chemiluminescent Microplate ElA for Cannabinoids. No carboxy-THC was present on the hair samples using the laboratory's standard GC/MS/MS procedure, while the THC on the samples ranged from $1 8 9 - 7 8 8 \mathrm { n g / 1 0 \mathrm { m g } }$ hair. In a report by Wilkins et al., levels of THC on unwashed hair of proven marijuana users ranged from $0 . 3 - 1 0 . 6 ~ \mathrm { n g / 1 0 ~ m g }$ hair, 2-3 orders of magnitude less than the THC contamination achieved in this experiment (J. Anal. Toxicol. 19:483, 1995)

The same smoke-contaminated samples were also washed by our standard wash procedure for marijuana presumptive positive samples, to test whether carboxy-THC could be formed during the wash procedure. No carboxy-THC was detected in the THC-contaminated samples also subjected to the wash procedure.

The same smoke-contaminated samples were also soaked for 30 minutes in water or for 30 minutes in saline, and then carried through the wash, extraction, and GC/MS/MS procedures. These saline-soaked or water-soaked samples tested positive in the EIA Cannabinoids Assay. No carboxy-THC was detected by GC/MS/MS in the THC-contaminated samples soaked in saline or water.

# Wash Procedure for Cannabinoids-Presumptive Positive Samples

i. . Add $_ { 2 \mathrm { m L } }$ of dry isopropanol and shake in waterbath for 15 minutes at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with shaking $@$ 100 -120 oscillations/minute. Remove isopropanol   
ii. Add $2 \mathrm { m L }$ of Wash Buffer $_ { [ 0 . 0 1 \mathbf { M } }$ phosphate buffer, $\tt p H 6 . 0$ , containing $0 . 1 \%$ BSA) and shake in waterbath for 30 minutes at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with shaking $@ 1 0 0 \cdot 1 2 0$ oscillations/minute. Remove Buffer.   
iii. Repeat Step ii. two more times

Summary of Cross-reactivity and Interference Studies

Cross-reactivity of sixty-seven compounds was investigated. Seventy-five compounds were tested for interference at $+ / { - 5 0 \% }$ of the cutoff showed no interference in the assay. The studies demonstrated the Cannabinoid EIA to be substantially equivalent with the predicate.

Stability of Calibrator and Control Solutions

The carboxy-THC calibrator and control solutions are prepared in-house by the laboratory from certified standards. Stability in methanol was shown for 1 year.

Recovery Study

Recovery of cannabinoids from hair of marijuana users was shown to be substantially equivalent t that  the predicate device.

# Conclusion:

The Psychemedics Chemiluminescent Microplate EIA for Cannabinoids in Hair is substantially equivalent to the predicate device k011426, and the results are substantially equivalent to GC/MS/MS results.

Indications For Use:

The Psychemedics Microplate ElA for Cannabinoids in Hair is an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the preliminary qualitative detection of cannabinoids in human head and body hair samples using a 11-nor-9-Carboxy- $\Delta ^ { 9 }$ -THC calibrator at $1 0 ~ \mathrm { p g } / 1 0 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ hair cutoff for the purpose of identifying marijuana use. This is an in vitro diagnostic device intended exclusively for Psychemedics use only and is not intended for sale to anyone.

The Psychemedics Chemiluminscent Microplate EIA for Cannabinoids assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.
