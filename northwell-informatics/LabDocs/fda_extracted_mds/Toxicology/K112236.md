Dear Mr. Shia:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895.

# Indications for Use Form

# Device Name: 'Wondfo Methylenedloxymethamphetamine Urine Test

Indications for Use:

Wondfo Methylenedioxymethamphetamine Urine Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative determination of MDMA In human urine at a cutoff concentration of 500ng/mL. The test is available in a dlp card format and a cup format. It is intended for prescription use and over the counter use.

The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtaln a conformed analytical result: GC/Ms is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result Is positive.
