Dear Mr. Shia:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Device Name: Wondfo Phencyclidine Urine Test

Indications for Use:

Wondfo Phencyclidine Urine Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative determination o Phencyclidine in human urine at a cutoff concentration of 25ng/mL.The test is available in a dip card format and a cup format. It is intended for prescription use and over the counter use.

The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a conformed analytical result. GC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.

Device Name: Wondfo Notriptyline Urine Test

Indications for Use:

Wondo Notriptyline Urine Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative determinationof Notriptyline (majormetaboliteof TricyclicAntidepressants) inhuman urine t a cutoconcentration $1 0 0 0 \ n g / m L$ .The test is available in a dip card format and a cup format. It is intended for prescription use and over the counter use. The tests will yield preliminary positive results when the prescription drug Nortriptyline are ingested, even at or above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly recognized drug levels for Nortriptyline in urine.

The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a conformed analytical result. GC/MS or HPLC is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.
