Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assay for Cocaine and Cocaine Metabolites

Common Name:

Hair Drug Screening Assay Cocaine and Cocaine Metabolites

Regulation Number:

CFR 862.3250 (ProCode DIO)

Classification Name:

Enzyme immunoassay, Cocaine and Cocaine Metabolites test System

Classification Panel: Predicate Device:

91 (Toxicology) Quest Diagnostics HairCheck-DT (Cocaine) k023626;

Product Description:

The Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assay for Cocaine and Cocaine Metabolites, is a test system using ELISA reagents and microplate reader for the qualitative detection of Cocaine and Cocaine Metabolites in hair samples at or above $5 0 0 \ p { \mathsf { g } } / { \mathsf { m g } }$ .

# Indication for Use:

The Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assay for Cocaine and Cocaine Metabolites (Cocaine) is a laboratory developed test that is intended to be used for the determination of the presence of Cocaine in human hair from the head. The Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assay Cocaine utilizes the International Diagnostics Systems Corp. One-Step enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Cocaine Testing Kit, for the qualitative detection of Cocaine at or above $5 0 0 \ p g / m g$ of hair for the purpose of identifying the use of Cocaine. To confirm a screen positive result, a more specific alternate chemical method, such as Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) operating in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode is the preferred method with deuterated internal standards. Professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when presumptive positive results are obtained.

This laboratory developed test is intended exclusively for in-house laboratory use only and is not intended for sale to anyone. Omega offers this laboratory developed test as a service to its clients.

Comparison:

When used to qualitatively detect Cocaine and Cocaine Metabolites in head hair specimens collected with the Omega Specimen Collection Device, the Omega assays yield results in substantial agreement with the predicate device.

# Comparison Performance Data:

Performance characteristic studies were conducted for   
Detection Limits and Reportable Range   
Precision   
Agreement   
Cosmetic Treatment   
Cross reactivity   
Environmental Contamination   
Calibrator and Control   
Extraction Recovery   
Shipping Study   
Stability of Hair Sample

All performance studies demonstrated that the Omega assay is in substantial agreement with the predicate products.

Results obtained from donor specimens showed that the qualitative results from the new assays are substantially equivalent to those obtained from the predicate devices.

# Conclusion:

The Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assay for Cocaine and Cocaine Metabolites is substantially equivalent to the Quest Diagnostics HairCheck-DT (Cocaine) k023626.

Dear Mr. Bard:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
