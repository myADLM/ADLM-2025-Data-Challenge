2. Indications(s) for use:

The Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assay for Cocaine and Cocaine Metabolites (Cocaine) is a laboratory developed test that is intended to be used for the qualitative determination of the presence of Cocaine in human hair from the head. The Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assay Cocaine utilizes the International Diagnostics Systems Corp. One-Step enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Cocaine Testing Kit, for the qualitative detection of Cocaine at or above $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m g }$ of hair for the purpose of identifying the use of Cocaine. To confirm a screen positive result, a more specific alternate chemical method, such as Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) operating in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode is the preferred method with deuterated internal standards. Professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when presumptive positive results are obtained.

This laboratory developed test is intended exclusively for in-house laboratory use only and is not intended for sale to anyone. Omega offers this laboratory developed test as a service to its clients.

# 3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

The assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical method (e.g. LC/MS/MS) must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Other chemical confirmation methods are available. Clinical consideration and professional judgment must be applied to the interpretation of any drug-of-abuse test result.

# 4. Special instrument requirements:

Confirmation testing is performed using an Agilent 6890 Series Gas Chromatograph/Agilent 5973 Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) operation in the selected ion monitoring mode using a deuterated internal standard. MSD Chemstation™ software is used for data collection and analysis.

# I. Device Description:

Donor samples are collected using the Omega Collection Kit. The Donor Sample is shipped to the Company facility where testing is conducted by trained scientists under the direction of the Laboratory Director. This submission accepts Donor Samples from trained external sources and does not conduct any Point of Care Testing (Home testing) or on-site testing (pre-employment, insurance, court ordered, employment random screening etc.).

The assay consists of two parts; a pre-analytical hair treatment procedure (to extract cocaine from the solid hair matrix to a measurable liquid matrix), and the screening assay. The screening assay is an Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA).

The Hair Drug Screening Assay for Cocaine uses the International Diagnostic Systems Corp (IDS) One-Step ELISA Cocaine micro-plate/reagents and a micro-plate reader for the qualitative detection of Cocaine in hair samples. The test system consists of micro strip plates coated with rabbit anti-BE polyclonal antibody, enzyme conjugate (horseradish peroxidase conjugated to cocaine), substrate (containing tetramethylbenzidine), and wash solution. Cut off concentration is $5 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m g }$ hair.

# L. Test Principle:

Approximately $1 0 { - } 1 5 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ of the test sample is used for the assay. The test sample is pulverized and then extracted under heat with acidified methanol. After cooling, the test sample is centrifuged/dried and then reconstituted in $0 . 1 \%$ BSA/BPBS buffer. The resulting solution is applied directly to the IDS ELISA

The prepared hair sample is added to a well of the micro strip plate and enzyme conjugate is added, followed by incubation. During this phase the enzyme-labeled drug conjugate competes with drug in the sample for a limited number of binding sites on the rabbit anti-BE polyclonal antibody-coated micro wells. The two bind in proportion to their concentrations. A wash solution is applied to remove any unbound materials. Enzyme substrate solution containing a chromagen is added. The reaction is stopped with an acid and the absorbance is read using a plate reader at $4 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . Color intensity is inversely proportional to the amount of drug present in the sample.

The only materials provided to a client (the requestor of the test) is the Sample Collection Kit. None of the laboratory materials, reagents or equipment is shipped or used outside of Omega’s laboratory facilities. Specifically, the Calibrator and Controls used in the Cocaine Assay are prepared for in-house use and none are shipped to clients or use by untrained nonprofessionals.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# 1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The intra-assay precision study was performed by taking eleven replicates of negative hair samples spiked with $\pm 2 5 \%$ , $\pm 5 0 \%$ , and $100 \%$ of the $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m g }$ hair cut-off value (corresponding to 125, 250, 375, 500, 625, 750, 875, and $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m g ) }$ . The material used to spike the hair sample was commercially available cocaine in methanol. This study was done in one run on one day with one lot of the screening assay.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not Applicable, the assay is intended for qualitative use c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Omega laboratories utilized in house prepared calibrator and control solutions. Cocaine in methanol is commercially purchased and used to make stock solutions that are used to prepare working solutions. The assigned values of the calibrator and control stock solutions are verified by GC/MS analysis against a current validated GC/MS calibrator solution each time a batch is prepared. The calibrator and control must fall within $10 \%$ of the target concentration. The commercial material is traceable to NIST.

# Stability

Control Solution: Cocaine in methanol is stable for a period of six months when stored in an amber bottle and refrigerated. The acceptance criteria were that the cocaine value of the control solution had to be within $10 \%$ of the target value of $5 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m g }$ after six months.

Hair: Storage of hair samples was studied by placing fifty hair samples that were previously tested in a collection kit for 2 years at $1 4 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . A variety of hair color and curvatures were tested. The study showed that the mean variance in cocaine concentration was $- 2 3 \%$ over two years.

A shipping study was performed to determine whether there were any adverse effects on hair samples when exposed to extreme temperatures and variations in humidity that might occur during sample shipment. Eight shipping boxes containing 25 known positive and negative samples were stored at approximately - ${ } . 1 3 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for about 15 hours and then were heated to $4 7 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for about 6 hours. Each box was then shipped to a different location, held for two days and sent back to the lab. The returned samples were screened and quantitatively tested using GC/MS. A variety of hair color and curvatures were tested. No hair samples had discordant results when returned and therefore it was determined

that there were no adverse effects on hair samples when exposed to extreme temperatures and humidity variations when being shipped.

Expected Values

The calibrator should be $5 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m g }$ and the controls should be $2 5 0 \mathrm { p g / m g }$ and 1000 $\mathrm { { p g / m g } }$ of hair.

d. Detection limit:

See Precision/Reproducibility section in M1.a above.

e. Analytical specificity:

Specificity and cross-reactivity was performed by adding compounds to negative hair samples. $1 0 { , } 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ of 270 unrelated compounds were spiked into drug-free hair, $- 5 0 \%$ , $+ 1 2 5 \%$ , and $+ 1 5 0 \%$ of cut-off cocaine-spiked hair. The result was compared to the control which contained $5 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ cocaine (cut-off). The following compounds were found to interfere in the assay.

Additionally, inhibition curves for structurally similar compounds were generated. Serial dilutions of each control compound were prepared in negative hair matrix extract. The concentration of the structurally related compound that gave a similar absorbance to the cut-off $( 5 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m g ) }$ cocaine control was determined and the percent cross reactivity was calculated. The results were as follows:

benzoylecgonine   
benzoylecgonine isopropyl ester   
cocaethylene   
cocaine   
ecgonine   
ecgonine methyl ester   
m-hydroxybenzoylecgonine   
norbenzoylecgonine   
norcaethylene   
norcocaine

# Cosmetic Treatment

Studies were performed to determine the effect of various treatments on the Omega Hair Drug Screening Assay for cocaine. Sixty-six specimens previously determined to be negative and 110 specimens determined to be positive for cocaine were treated and analyzed by the ELISA protocol and the GC/MS confirmation method. All samples determined to be negative prior to treatment remained negative post treatment. The following treatments were performed:

# Environmental Contamination Study

Preliminary positive hair sample results by the screening method could be due to environmental contamination. All positive should be sent for confirmation testing on a reference method to distinguish between true positive and those samples that were positive due to external exposure.

f. Assay cut-off:

The Assay cut-off is 500 pg cocaine/mg hair. Analytical performance of the device around the claimed cutoff is described in the precision section M.1a above.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The method comparison was performed by testing 345 hair samples with the candidate and comparing to the reference method, GC/MS. Each specimen was divided into two aliquots and one was used fro screening and the other for GC/MS confirmation. The results were:
