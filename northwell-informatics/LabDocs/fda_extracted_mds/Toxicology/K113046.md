# C. Device Description:

The Ameditech ImmuTest Multi-Drug Screen is a lateral flow immunoassay intended for professional (preription) use only.The device is used for the qualitative determination of parent compound an/or major metabolites of drugs in human urine specimens, and results are read visually.The device will be aavalable three ormat hat  ential est stripsDipcrCasstean upThem device contains up to seventeen (17) assays that can include up to thirteen (13) different drugs at various cutoff concentrations. The assays detect different illicit drugs and medications that are commonly abused. Once the urine sample is administered, negative results can be read as soon as 1 minute and positive results should be read between 5 to 10 minutes. The presence of the line on the te reginndicates aegativeresult or he drug and thesence aeon th est reginnd u should always appear, regardless of the presence of drugs or metabolites in the urine sample. This means that a negative urine sample will produce both a test line and control line, and a positive urine saple willenerate nly a ntol l.Te preenccntrol le erves  builn control wc demonstrates that the test is performed properly.

# D. Intended Use:

The ImmuTest Multi-Drug Screen is a one-step immunoassay for the qualitative detection of multiple drugs and drug metabolites in human urine at the following cutoff concentrations:

The ImmuTest Multi-Drug Screen consists of three test formats: card, cassette and cup. The configurations of the ImmuTest Multi-Drug Screen consist of any combination of the drugs listed above. The ImmuTest Multi-Drug Screen is used to obtain a visual, qualitative result and is intended for professional use only.

This assay provides only a preliminary result. Clinical consideration and professional judgment must be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly in evaluating a preliminary positive result. In order to obtain a confirmed analytical result, a more specific alternate chemical method is needed. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) are the preferred confirmation methods.

# E. Comparison with the Predicate

The modified device is identical to the cleared predicates referenced above (Ko50186). The drug strips cleared by FDA in submissions K040092, K042975, and K063015 will be consolidated into a single device. The purpose o this submissin is to cover allthe drug strips and ther respective cutofs with a single 510(k) clearance. See Section 12.2 of this submission for a detailed comparison of the modified device with the predicates.

# 510(k) Summary

# F. Nonclinical Data:

As the test strips in both the modified and predicate devices are identical in terms of intendeduse, test principle, manufacturing process, and raw materials; simplified performance studies were conducted to demonstrate that the sensitivity, precision, and specificity of the modified device was unchanged from the predicate devices.The analytical performance verification and validation testing confirms that the Ameditech ImmuTest Multi-Drug Screen has equivalent performance compared with the predicate v es prei ucbili alytialsitiviyanalytl seici  inte substances.

# G.Clinical Data:

Both the modified and predicate devices use identical test strips, therefore we did not conduct any clinical studies for this special 510(k) submission, because the performance characteristics that were validated in the predicate submissions are applicable to the modified device.

# H.Conclusions Drawn from Testing Results:

Performance verification and validation studies have demonstrated that the device is as safe, as effective, and performs as well or better than the predicate device.
