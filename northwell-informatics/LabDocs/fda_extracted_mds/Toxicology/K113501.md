# C. Device Description:

The Ameditech CHECKCUp™ Multi-Drug Test is a lateral flow immunoassay intended for professional (prescription) use only.The device is used for the qualitative determination of parent compound and/or major metabolites of drugs inhuman urine specimens, and results are read visually.The device will be made available in two formats that use identical test strips: Round Cup and Flat Cup.The modified device contains up to seventeen (17)assays that include fourteen (14) different drugs at various cutof concentrations. The assays detect different illcit drugs and medications that are commonly abused. Once the urine sample is administered, negative results can be read as soon as 1 minute and positive results should be read between 5 to 1 minutes.The presence of the lne on the test regin indicates a tivrsult  eand hesencnegnict psvresul vl   pe t he n gin hs  ou w regardless of the presenceof drugs or metabolites inhe urie sample.This means that a negativerine sample will produce both a test line and control line, and a positive urine sample willgenerate only a cn eThe presencecntrol ne erves s  builn contol whic demonstrates that thees is performed properly.

The CHECkCUp™ Multi-Drug Test consists of two test formats: round cup and flat cup. The configurations of the CHECkCUp™ Multi-Drug Test consist of any combination of the drugs listed above. The CHECkCUp™ Multi-Drug Test is used to obtain a visual, qualitative result and is intended for professional use only.

This assay provides only a preliminary result. Clinical consideration and professional judgment must be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly in evaluating a preliminary positive result. In order to obtain a confirmed analytical result, a more specific alternate chemical method is needed. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) are the preferred confirmation methods.

The CHECKCUp™ Multi-Drug Test is a device modification of the previously 510(k) cleared Ameditech DrugSmart Cup (K053175).The CHECKCUp™ Multi-Drug Test expands the current drug test menu of the Ameditech DrugSmart Cup by adding the drug test strips cleared in K113046.The CHECKCUp™ MultiDrTest has two formats:round cup and flat cup.The CHECkC™ round cup is exactly the same cup as in the DrugSmart Cup.Both CHECKCUp™ round cup and DrugSmart Cup consist of multiple 1-drug sps.The plastic strip holder in the CHEC™lat and DrugSmart Cup are both flat except in the DrugSmart Cup,the plasticstrip holder is a malleable piece of plastic that gets curved when inserted ino the DrugSmart CupThe CHEckcu™ flat cup plastic strip holder stays flat when inserted into the CHECKCUP flat cup.The CHECKCUp™ flat cup consist of 1-drug/strip tests or 2-drug/strip tests or a mixture of both.Below is an illustration of DrugSmart Cup and CHECKCU™ Multi-Dru Test round and flat format).The modified and 510(k) cleared devices are identical in terms of intended use, principle, test strip manufacturing process and raw material used.The modified device detects 17 drug tests versus these drug tests are detected in separate devices as in devices K053175 and K113046.

# 510(k) Summary

# Nonclinical Data:

As the test strips in both the modified and predicate devices are identical in terms of intended use, test principle, manufacturing process, and raw materials; simplified performance studies were conducted to demonstrate that the sensitivity, precision, and specificity of the modified device was unchanged from the predicate devices. The study approach was based on previous similar submission (k113046).The analytical performance verification and validation testing confirms that the Ameditech CHECkCup has equivalent performance compared with the predicate devices in terms of precision (reproducibility), analytical sensitivity, analytical specificity, and interfering substances.Refer to Appendix DTesting Strategy. '

# E. Clinical Data:

l clinical studies for this special 510(k) submission, because the performance characteristics that were validated in the predicate submissions are applicable to the modified device.

# F. Conclusions Drawn from Testing Results:

Performance verification and validation studies have demonstrated that the device is as safe, as effective, and performs as well or better than the predicate device.

Dear Mr. Casey:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls.
