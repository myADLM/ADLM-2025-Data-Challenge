<table><tr><td>Product Code</td><td>CFR #</td></tr><tr><td>DJG</td><td>21 CFR 862.3650</td></tr><tr><td>DJG</td><td>21 CFR 862.3650</td></tr></table>

The legally marketed device to which we are claiming equivalence [807.92(a)(3)]:

1. Acon Laboratories, Inc. Acon BUP One Step Buprenorphene Test Strip and Acon BUP One Step Buprenorphene Test Device, K060466.   
2. Acon Laboratories, Inc. Acon OXY One Step Oxycodone Test Strip and Acon OXY One Step Oxycodone Test Device, K033047

5 Description of the device:

Assay Principle: Immunochromatograph assay for Buprenorphine and Oxycodone Urine Test using a lateral flow, one. step system for the qualitative detection of Buprenorphine, Oxycodone(target analyte) in human urine. Each assay uses a monoclonal antibody-dye conjugate from mouse against drug with gold chloride and fixed drug-protein conjugate and anti-mouse $\mathsf { I g } \mathsf { G }$ polyclonal antibody in membrane.

6 Intended use of the device:

Wondfo Buprenorphine Urine Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative determination o Buprenorphine in human urine at a cutoff concentration of 10 ng/mL.The test is available in a dip card format and a cup format. For in vitro diagnostic use only. This product is only intended for prescription use and is not intended for point-of-care use.

The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS or LC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.

Wondfo Oxycodone Urine Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative determination of Oxycodone in human urine at a cutoff concentration of 100 ng/mL. The test is available in a dip card forat and a cup format. For in vitro diagnostic use only. This product is intended or over-the-counter and prescription use.

The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS or LC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.
