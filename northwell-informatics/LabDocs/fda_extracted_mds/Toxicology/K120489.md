# 807.92 (a)(4): Device Description

The Pathwork $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Tissue of Origin Test Kit-FFPE is a test kit consisting of the Pathchip microarray, reagents, software, and labeling.

The Pathchip is a custom-designed microarray manufactured by Affymetrix, Inc. (Santa Clara, CA) per Pathwork design requirements and functions in a manner similar to GeneChip HG-U133A. The Pathchip has over 500,000 unique oligonucleotide features (18-micron in size), covering over 18,400 transcript variants (across 22,300 probesets) which in turn represent 14,500 of the best characterized human genes. Each transcript is represented by a probeset, comprised of 1 1-16 pairs of oligonucleotide probes. The probesets are spatially distributed over the array and are used to measure the level of transcription of each sequence represented on the array. For each array, there are 2000 probesets representing 2000 human genes which are used by the Tissue of Origin Test Kit FFPE algorithm as markers to identify the tissue of origin of the specimen being tested. These probesets were selected using machine learning methods and each set has between 11 and 16 probe pairs of 25 bases whose sequences are matched to mRNA species that are found in human tissue. In addition, the array has 29 probesets that are used for normalization and data verification.

The algorithm of the Pathwork $\textcircled{8}$ Tissue of Origin Test was developed using a database of 2196 specimens, divided into independent training and test datasets. The test development used a machine learning approach based on marker selection to build a predictive model. The model consists of a list of markers, a set of reference (support) samples and a set of coefficients. These components are combined to produce 15 Similarity Scores, one for each of the possible tissues on the test panel. Each similarity score ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score being associated with a higher likelihood that the input specimen has a molecular signature of the corresponding tissue of origin. The 15 similarity scores are scaled to sum up to 100. Each is based on the microarray standardized expression (SE) values of selected biomarkers. The process consists of the following steps:

1. Read SE values for the biomarkers used in the Tissue of Origin Test from the input file.   
2. Compute a decision function ("score") for each of 105 possible pairings of the 15 tissues on the test panel with respect to the sample described by the input SE values.   
3. Convert the 105 pairwise scores into pairwise probabilities.   
4. Reduce the 105 pairwise probabilities to 15 Similarity Scores, one for each Tissue of Origin. These are the final 15 Similarity Scores presented in the Tissue of Origin Test Report.

The Pathwork Specimen Processing Guide contains instructions for the user to process tissue specimens in the manner specimens were processed during the clinical validation of the Pathwork Tissue of Origin Test Kit  FFPE.

Components included in the kit Microarray: Pathchip microarrays, packaged in boxes of 5 or 10.

Gene Expression Reagents: Reagents for specimen processing (extraction, amplification, labeling, hybridization, staining and washing).

Report   
Tissue of Origin Test Kit-FFPE Report is produced by the Pathwork System Software (by licensed agreement): The Pathwork $\otimes$ System Software receives data from the scanned PathchipTM microarray and performs data quality control and analysis. The System Software then generates a Pathwork $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Tissue of Origin Test Kit-FFPE Report which provides a Similarity Score for each of the 15 tissues on the test panel. The test report is accessible for clinical interpretation via a secure password protected website.

# 807.92 (a)(5): Intended Use

Intended use: The Pathwork $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Tissue of Origin Test is an in vitro diagnostic intended to measure the degree of similarity between the RNA expression patterns in a patient's formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor and the RNA expression patterns in a database of fifteen tumor types (poorly differentiated, undifferentiated and metastatic cases) that were diagnosed according to then current clinical and pathological practice. This test should be evaluated by a qualified physician in the context of the patient's clinical history and other diagnostic test results.

Limitations: The Pathwork Tissue of Origin Test is not intended to establish the origin of tumors (e.g. cancer of unknown primary) that cannot be diagnosed according to current clinical and pathological practice. It is not intended to subclassify or modify the classification of tumors that can be diagnosed by current clinical and pathological practice, nor to predict disease course or survival or treatment efficacy, nor to distinguish primary from metastatic tumor. Tumor types not in the Pathwork Tissue of Origin Test database may have RNA expression patterns that are similar to patterns in the database; therefore, results cannot be used to distinguish tumor types in the database from tumor types not in the database.

# 807.92 (b)(1): Brief Description of Non-clinical data

The study was a comparison of the same tumor specimens already analyzed using the 510(k) cleared method, with specimens where the amount of starting tissue was diminished to provide between 30 and 150 nanograms of RNA. In addition, the procedure had been modified to include the use of ethanol in the purification of biotinylated DNA, and this modification was also included in the study. Specimens were selected from reserves of FFPE tumor specimens employed for assessment of performance during development of the TOO-FFPE Test. These tumors had extant results obtained when $\geq 1 5 0 ~ { \mathfrak { n g } }$ of RNA had been extracted using the 510(k) cleared method, and they all agreed with their available diagnosis. These tumor specimens were manually dissected under a microscope to provide less tissue for extraction, resulting in smaller amounts of extracted RNA. Several very small specimens were taken from each tumor sample. RNA was extracted from each of the smaller specimens, and the amount of RNA present determined spectroscopically. If a single specimen provided between 30 and $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g }$ , and could be concentrated to at least $9 . 5 ~ \mathrm { \mathfrak { n } g / \mu l }$ , it was used. Otherwise, up to 4 extractions were combined until at least $3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g }$ RNA was present at a concentration of at least $9 . 5 ~ \mathrm { \mathfrak { n g } / \mu l }$ . The final tissues used were at least $0 . 0 5 ~ \mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ with at least $60 \%$ tumor content. These total RNA samples were carried through the modified assay and results compared to those obtained with the larger amounts of total RNA for the same tissue. Forty-five tumors, 3 of each of the tumor types in the database, were entered into the study. Comparisons between $\geq 1 5 0 ~ \mathtt { n g }$ RNA speciments processed without ethanol, and $3 0 { \cdot } 1 5 0 ~ \mathfrak { n } \ \mathfrak { g }$ of RNA extracted and processed with ethanol could be made for 43 tumors. Forty-two of these were concordant and one was not, for a % concordance of $9 7 . 7 \%$ $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of $8 7 . 7 \% , 9 9 . 9 \% )$ . The change was considered validated, because all preestablished criteria were met or exceeded.

Additional data analysis was performed "for information". Similarity score regression plots were obtained comparing the similarity scores for all 15 tissues, for matched pairs of specimens that yielded either ≥l50 ng of total RNA processed in the absence of ethanol (x-axis) vs. between 30 and 150 ng of total RNA processed in the presence of ethanol (y-axis). Similarity scores range between 0 and 100. The resulting regression analysis gave an intercept of 0.61 (0.11, 1.10) and a slope of 0.91 (0.88. 0.93) and an R of 0.94.

Additionally, a Bland Altman plot was made comparing the difference between the highest similarity scores for the $\geq 1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g }$ RNA runs and the highest similarity score for the $3 0 \mathrm { - } 1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g }$ runs to the average for these two similarity scores. The mean value of the difference was 4 and no trends were observed.

# Indications for Use

510(k) Number (if known):_K120489

Device Name: Pathwork $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Tissue of Oriqin Test Kit-FFPE

Indications For Use:

The Pathwork $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Tissue of Origin Test is an in vitro diagnostic intended to measure the degree of similarity between the RNA expression patterns in a patient's formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor and the RNA expression patterns in a database of fifteen tumor types (poorly differentiated, undifferentiated and metastatic cases) that were diagnosed according to then current clinical and pathological practice. This test should be evaluated by a qualified physician in the context of the patient's clinical history and other diagnostic test results.

Limitations: The Pathwork $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Tissue of Origin Test is not intended to establish the origin of tumors (e.g. cancer of unknown primary) that cannot be diagnosed according to current clinical and pathological practice. It is not intended to subclassify or modify the classification of tumors that can be diagnosed by current clinical and pathological practice, nor to predict disease course or survival or treatment efficacy, nor to distinguish primary from metastatic tumor. Tumor types not in the Pathwork Tissue of Origin Test database may have RNA expression patterns that are similar to patterns in the database; therefore, results cannot be used to distinguish tumor types in the database from tumor types not in the database.
