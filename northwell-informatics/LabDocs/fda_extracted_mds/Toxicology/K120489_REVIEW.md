2. Classification: Class II

3. Product code: OIW, Software, similarity score algorithm, tissue of origin for malignant tumor types

4. Panel: Toxicology (91)

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The Pathwork $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Tissue of Origin Test is an in vitro diagnostic intended to measure the degree of similarity between the RNA expression patterns in a patient’s formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor and the RNA expression patterns in a database of fifteen tumor types (poorly differentiated, undifferentiated and metastatic cases) that were diagnosed according to then current clinical and pathological practice. This test should be evaluated by a qualified physician in the context of the patient’s clinical history and other diagnostic test results.

Limitations: The Pathwork $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Tissue of Origin Test is not intended to establish the origin of tumors (e.g. cancer of unknown primary) that cannot be diagnosed according to current clinical and pathological practice. It is not intended to subclassify or modify the classification of tumors that can be diagnosed by current clinical and pathological practice, nor to predict disease course or survival or treatment efficacy, nor to distinguish primary from metastatic tumor. Tumor types not in the Pathwork $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Tissue of Origin Test database may have RNA expression patterns that are similar to patterns in the database. Therefore, results cannot be used to distinguish tumor types in the database from tumor types not in the database.

2. Indication(s) for use: Same as intended use

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements:

Affymetrix GeneChip $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Microarray Instrumentation System (k080995)

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not applicable.

# L. Test Principle:

The test uses curls from a formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) block. The Origin Test Kit-FFPE test can be performed on a single $1 0 \mathrm { - } \mu \mathrm { m }$ -thick curl cut from the block, or on up to five curls, to obtain tissue area of at least $2 5 \mathrm { \bar { m m } } ^ { 2 }$ . The specimen must contain at least $60 \%$ viable tumor. It can also use specimens that are manually dissected under a microscope (up to 4 manual dissected specimens). The manually dissected specimen must contain at least $60 \%$ viable tumor with a recommended tissue volume of at least $0 . 0 5 \mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ . The tissue must be de-paraffinized and total RNA must be isolated per the Pathwork Specimen Processing Guide (SPG). Thirty (30) nanograms of total RNA at a concentration of $1 0 \mathrm { n g / \mu l }$ $( \pm 0 . 5 \mathrm { n g / \mu l } )$ are required to perform the test.

The procedural steps include total RNA extraction, reverse transcription, cDNA purification, microarray gene expression analyses, and determination of similarity of 15 tissues of origin and generation of the report. Each specimen analyzed will produce 15 Similarity Scores, one for each tissue on the panel. Each Similarity Score is a measure of the similarity of the gene expression profile of the specimen to the profile of the indicated tissue, ranging from 0 (very low similarity) to 100 (very high similarity). Similarity Scores for all 15 tissues sum to 100. For each Origin Test Kit–FFPE test performed, a test report is generated that quantifies the similarity of the RNA expression pattern found in a tumor specimen (poorly or un-differentiated primary tumors, as well as metastatic tumors) to expression patterns found in tumor specimens from 15 known tissues of origin and provided back to the laboratory over a secure internet connection in pdf format.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Forty-five FFPE specimens representing 15 tumor types with three samples per tumor type were used for the method comparison study. They were selected from reserves of specimens used in the analytical studies of the predicate device k092967. Multiple areas $( 2 - 1 0 \mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 } )$ ) were manually dissected under a microscope from $5 \mathrm { - } \mu \mathrm { m }$ sections of each tumor specimen. RNA was extracted from each manually dissected sample. The amount of RNA was determined spectroscopically. If a single manually dissected sample did not provide between 30 and $1 5 0 \mathrm { n g }$ at a concentration of at least $9 . 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / \mu L }$ required for the assay, multiple extractions were combined. These total RNA samples were tested with the modified assay and results were compared to those obtained with the larger amounts of total RNA for the same specimens which have available diagnosis.

Among 45 FFPE specimens, two specimens were excluded from the comparison. One failed the overall quality control criteria (signal threshold of 10); the other was erroneously chosen and no data from a paired specimen in the $\geq 1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g }$ RNA category was available. Therefore, comparison was based on 43 tumors. The concordance between $\geq 1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g }$ RNA specimens processed without ethanol, and 30-150 ng of RNA extracted and processed with ethanol was $9 7 . 7 \%$ (42/43) and the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval was $8 7 . 7 { - } 9 9 . 9 \%$ . One sample tested using modified device $( 3 0 - 1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g }$ of RNA and processed with ethanol) had discordant result with the available diagnosis.
