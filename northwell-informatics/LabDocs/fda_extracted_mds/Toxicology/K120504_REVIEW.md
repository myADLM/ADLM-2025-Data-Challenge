# I. Device Description:

The product is prepared from human urine with addition of preservatives, stabilizers, constituents of animal origin, abused drugs and their metabolites. It is a liquid ready to use quality control material.

The serum of each donor, who contributed urine for this product, was tested by FDA accepted methods and found to be non-reactive for Hepatitis B surface Antigen (HBsAg), antibody to Hepatitis C (HCV) and antibody to HIV-1/HIV-2.

# J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

1. Predicate device name(s): Liquichek Urine Toxicology Control (Screen Series)   
2. Predicate K number(s): K033924   
3. Comparison with predicate:

Showing in table 1, both devices have same matrix and both are quality control materials that measure similar analytes. These two devices are different in that the candidate device added two novel analytes ­ oxazepam and dmethamphetamine ­ and removed three analytes ­ nordiazepam, nortriptyline (TCA), and d­amphetamine. Since the preservative of the candidate device is a cocktail of antibiotics and it does not contain any hazardous materials, the candidate device does not require the hazard symbol.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

The sponsor did not reference any standards in their submission.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable.

c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):

Candidate product consists of eight control materials. Controls are human urine spiked with known concentrations of drugs which were gravimetrically prepared. Expected concentrations were verified by reference laboratories. Minimum number of laboratories, replicate measurements, or assay systems is not, however, specified.

Although GC/MS and Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) analysis is performed during stability studies, (see below), the traceability of control results to GC/MS and EIA is not specified or discussed by the sponsor.

Stability studies are summarized for these controls. Product claims include: (1) open vial: 30 days at $2 ^ { \circ } C$ to $8 \%$ , (2) closed vial (Thawed): 45 days at $2 ^ { \circ } C$ to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and (3) shelf life stability: 2 years at ${ } - 2 0 { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . The sponsor specifies the frequency of testing, the method for testing the materials (GC/MS or EIA), environmental conditions of storage, and acceptance criteria for the study (less than $10 \%$ variance comparing to time zero). Accelerated stability studies were employed by incubating controls at elevated temperatures (i.e. $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $1 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , etc.) to detect alterations in product performance more rapidly than would be seen under normal storage conditions of ${ } - 2 0 { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $\mathrm { - 7 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ . Estimated expiration date was predicted using a stability model with activation energy of the $2 0 \mathrm { - k C a l / m o l }$ or Arrhenius Model. On-going real time studies are long-term and being performed. All procedures appear to be compliance with standard for the industry.

Representative values of the materials are provided and look appropriate.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable.

e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies: a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable.

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical sensitivity: Not applicable.

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range: Not applicable.
