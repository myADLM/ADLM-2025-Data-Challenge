# I. Device Description:

Both TDM Multi-Constituent Calibrator and QMS TDM Multi-Constituent Calibrator are identical calibrators and the only difference is the trade name. The calibrator set is sold separately and may be used with any reagent lot. The calibrators in this set are designed for use as a unit. Do not substitute or mix calibrators with those from other lots.

Each TDM and QMS Multiconstituent Calibrator set is packaged in a rectangular cardboard box with a 12-bottle divider, a product insert, and a value sheet. Kits are stored refrigerated at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . TDM Multiconstituent Calibrator set is prepared from a bovine serum matrix and contains the following analytes (6 levels each): amikacin, carbamazepine, digoxin, gentamicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, quinidine, theophylline, valproic acid, and vancomycin. Sodium azide at $0 . 0 9 \%$ and ProClin 300 at $0 . 1 \%$ are present as preservatives. TDM Multiconstituent Calibrator levels are provided in liquid ready to use form and can be stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until the expiration date on the label. Once opened, the opened bottles are stable for 60 days when capped tightly and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): None were referenced.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability:

Both TDM Multi-Constituent Calibrator and QMS TDM Multi-Constituent Calibrator are traceable to USP standards. The Primary Reference Standards were prepared by gravimetric additions of the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) grade drugs into a drug-free human serum pool. These materials were aliquot in single-use cryo vials, and stored at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ .

# Stability:

Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. Stability characteristics of the TDM and QMS TDM MultiConstituent Calibrators were determined using accelerated (closed bottle) stability studies, real time (closed bottle) stability studies and real-time opened bottle stability studies. Based on the accelerated stress stability data, the shelf life claim is set for 24 months at $5 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Real-time stability studies demonstrated a shelf life claim of 24 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Open bottle stability of 60 days was demonstrated at the recommended storage temperature $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and for 24 hours at $1 5 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Open vial and closed vial expiration dates are located in the package insert.

# Value Assignment:

The values of the TDM Multi-Constituent Calibrators (TDM MCC) are assigned by generating calibration curve using internal Primary Reference Standards with their target values for each level of analyte. Assay controls were used to verify that control recoveries are within the published ranges to validate the calibration curve. Two lots of the TDM MCC were used and one lot of control were used in the value assignment procedure. TDM MCC Level 1 values are assigned to zero, since no drugs are present. The TDM MCC and the corresponding Primary Reference Standards were assayed on the Abbott

Architect c16000. TDM MCC values were determined by ratio calculations of the assay recovery values of the TDM MCC and assay recovery values of the Primary Reference Standards. Calibration curves are generated using the TDM MCC with the new assigned values (shown in the table below).
