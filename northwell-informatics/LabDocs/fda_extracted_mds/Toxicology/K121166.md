4. Description of the device:

Wondfo Multi-Drug Urine Test Cup and Wondfo Multi-Drug Urine Test Panel are competitive binding, lateral flow immunochromatographic assays for qualitative and simultaneous detection of Cocaine, Methadone, Methamphetamine, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Morphine, Morphine 2000, Phencyclidine, Notriptyline in human urine samples. A positive urine sample will not generate a colored-line for the specific drug tested in the designated region. A negative urine specimen or a urine sample containing Cocaine, Methadone, Methamphetamine, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Morphine, Morphine 2000, Phencyclidine, Notriptyline at the concentration below the designated cutoff levels will generate a colored line in the designated test region for the drug. To serve as a test control, a color line will always appear at the control region.

5. Intended use of the device:

Wondfo Multi-Drug Urine Test Cup and Wondfo Multi-Drug Urine Test Panel are competitive binding, lateral flow immunochromatographic assays for qualitative and simultaneous detection of Cocaine, Methadone, Methamphetamine, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Morphine, Morphine 200o, Phencyclidine, Notriptyline in human urine at the cutoff concentrations of:

Configuration of the Wondfo Multi-Drug Urine Test Cup and Wondfo Multi-Drug Urine Test Panel can consist of any combination of the above listed drug analytes.

The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS or LC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.

# 6. Comparison to the predicate device

Wondfo Multi-Drug Urine Test Cup and Wondfo Multi-Drug Urine Test Panel are a "modified" product format derived from the previously FDA-cleared Wondfo single DOA Tests. The FDA-cleared device and the 510K number are listed in the following Table.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Previously Cleared Wondfo DOA Tests</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>510K Number</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Product Code</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cocaine /COC</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>K112071</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>DIO, LAF</td></tr></table>

Wondfo Multi-Drug Urine Test Cup is a multi-drug test that offers any combination from 2 to 8 drugs of abuse tests while the predicate devices are single-drug test. And the Wondfo Multi-Drug Urine Test Panel is the same as the test dip card format of the predicate devices except that the Wondfo Multi-Drug Urine Test Panel is a multi-drug test that offers any combination from 2 to 8 drugs of abuse tests while the predicate devices are single-drug test.
