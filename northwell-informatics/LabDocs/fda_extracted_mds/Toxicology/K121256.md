Classification Name:

Alcohol test system

Classification:

21 CFR 862.3040, Class II, Product Code DIC

Predicate Devices:

K894001 Orasure Technologies Inc, QED A150 Saliva Alcohol Test

Device Description:

ALCO-SCREEN $\mathfrak { o } _ { 0 2 }$ is a visually read qualitative test for the detection of alcohol using saliva. The test strip indicates the relative Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) at $0 . 0 2 \%$ . The device consists of a box of 24 individually packaged single test strips each designed for single use and to be disposable, and instruction for use.

Intended Use:

The ALCO-SCREEN ${ \mathfrak { G } } _ { 0 2 }$ is a qualitative screenig tst used to detect the presence of ethyl alcohol in human saliva. The test detects relative Blood Alcohor Concentrations (BAC) greater than or equal to $0 . 0 2 \%$ . Results are used for the diagnosis of alcohol intoxication. For in vitro diagnostic use. The assay is a disposable test for one-time use.

Technological   
Comparison to Predicate   
Device:

Alco-Screen ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 0 2 }$ is similar to the predicate device. Both tests can be used to qualitatively measure alcohol in human saliva. Additionally, both employ enzymatic oxidation of alcohol and chromogenic reaction methodology to produce a visually interpreted color change. Performance test results confirm that design differences do not pose new issues of safety or effectiveness.

Performance Testing:

The performance characteristics of Alco-Screen ${ \mathfrak { P } } _ { 0 2 }$ were determined by conducting precision and reproducibility studies, analytical specificity studies, stability studies, and field use studies with an evidentiary device. Results demonstrate that Alco-Screen® performs as intended and meets all established specifications.

# Conclusion:

Based upon the design, technology, performance, and intended use, Alco-Screen® 02 is substantially equivalent to the predicate device currently marketed under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

Dear Mr. Reynolds:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and'have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
