# Proposed Labeling or Promotional Material for the Device:

Description of the device can be found in the attached proposed labeling, including an explanation of how the device functions, technical principle and concepts that form the basis for the device, as well as the physical and performance characteristics of the device, such as device design, materials used and physical properties. In accordance with FDA labeling requirements 21 CFR 809.10, enclosed are the draft copies of product labeling including copies of the technical product inserts. See ATTACHMENT B and C, page 42 and 46 of this submission.

# Intended Use

The Chemtrue® test device is intended for the qualitative detection of drugs of abuse, for Over-theCounter (OTC) and in vitro diagnostic use.

The assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) are the preferred confirmatory methods.

Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drugs of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.

# Technological Characteristics and Science Principles

The Drugs of Abuse (DOA) Screen Panels are one-step lateral flow immunoassays in which chemically labeled drugs (drug-protein conjugates) compete for limited antibody binding sites with drugs that may be present in urine. The test device consists of up to six test strips placed into separate panels of a plasticholder.On each test strip, a drug-protein conjugate is striped on the test bandof the membrane - known as the test region (T) and the drug antibody-colloidal gold conjugate pads are placed at one end of the membrane (opposite in morphine). In the absence of drugs in the urine, the solution of the colored antibody-colloidal gold conjugates move along with the sample solution upward chromatographically by capillary action across the membrane to the immobilized drug-protein conjugate zones on the test band region. The colored antibody-gold conjugates then complexes with the drug-protein conjugates to form visible lines. Therefore, the formation of the visible precipitant in the test band occurs when the test urine is negative or the drug. I any drug is present in the urie, the drug/metabolite antigen competes with drug-protein conjugates on the test band region for the limited antibody on the colored drug antibody-colloidal gold conjugate pad. When a sufficient amount of drug is present in the urine, the drug will saturate the limited antibody binding sites and the colored antibody -colloidal gold conjugate cannot bind to the drug-protein conjugate at the test region of the test strip. Therefore, absence of the color band on the test region indicates a preliminary positive result.

A control band with a different antigen/antibody reaction is added to the membrane strip at the control region (C) to indicate that the test has performed properly. This control line is manufactured as a builtin internal control of the test device and should always appear regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite. If the control line does not appear the test cassette should be discarded. The presence of this colored band in the control region also serves 1) as verification that adequate specimen volume is added (flooding, if too much urine is added, or no flow, due to insufficient urine volume), 2) the test device IS properly functioning, and 3) as reagent control.

# Comparison with Predicate

# DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION:

Based on the technological characteristics/principle, features of the device designs, test specimen matrix, test method and performance characterizations, as the set forth above, it can be concluded that Chemtrue® Single/ Multi-panel Drug Screen tests are substantially equivalent to the predicate kit and the other products that are manufactured by Alere and Alfa Scientific Design Inc. presently distributed commercially.

# Performance Data:

Chemtron Biotech, Inc. has reviewed the requirements of Section 514 of the Act, which states that to date no performance standards has been established for drug screen test systems by the FDA.

However, the studies listed in the notification were conducted according to "Assessing the Safety and Effectiveness of Home-Use in vitro Diagnostic Devices (IVDs): Draft Points to Consider Regarding Labeling and Premarket Submissions (Text Only). Center for Devices and Radiological Health. October 1988", "The Draft Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff" - " Premarket Submission and Labeling Recommendations for Drugs of Abuse Screening Tests, issued on: December 2, 2003", including the design of draft labeling and package inserts.

Chemtrue® Single / Multi-panel Drug Screen Cassette and Dip Card tests are one-step, lateral flow, colloidal gold based chromatographic immunoassays for the rapid, qualitative detection of Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Marijuana (THC), Phencyclidine, Cocaine and Opiates (Morphine) 300 in human urine. It is intended for Over-the-Counter (OTC) Use.

This assay provides a preliminary test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory result. Clinical and professional judgment must be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are obtained.

The product performance characteristics of Chemtrue® Single/Multi-panel Drug Screen cassette and Dip Card were evaluated by 200 of OTC lay-users from three (3) sites with the confirmed GC/MS values in a blind-labeled spiked urine correlation study. The results of these studies demonstrate Chemtrue® Single/ Multi-panel Drug Screen Test to be substantially equivalent to the performance characteristics of GC/MS methodology. Correlation studies produced a $9 8 . 9 \%$ total correlation when compared to the GC/MS methodology.

# CONCLUSION:

Compared to the GC/MS values of the spiked urine samples that were tested by 200 OTC Lay-users from separate three (3) sites, the OTC accuracy study results demonstrate that the intended lay-users can perform the testing and interpret the results correctly with equal to and greater than $9 8 . 9 \%$ agreement with the GC/MS assayed values. The results also showed the substantial equivalency between the Chemtrue® Single/ Multi-Panel Drug Screen tests of both Dip Card and Cassette formats and the GC/MS reference method. Based on the study results, it can conclude that Chemtrue® Single/ Multi-panel Drug Screen cassette and Dip card is safe and effective in detecting Amphetamine, Cocaine, Methamphetamine, Marijuana, Opiates (Morphine) 300 and Phencyclidine in human urine.

Other performance data, such as analytical sensitivity (Cutoff characteristics), precision (Reproducibility), specificity (Cross-reactivity and interference) and stability studies were established in k102203.
