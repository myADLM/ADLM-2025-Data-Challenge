5 Description of the device:

Assay Principle: Immunochromatograph assay for Cannabinoids and Propoxyphene Urine Test using a lateral flow, one step system for the qualitative detection of 11-nor-49-THC-9-cooH and d-propoxyphene (target analyte) in human urine. Each assay uses a monoclonal antibody-dye conjugate from mouse against drug with gold chloride and fixed drug-protein conjugate and anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody in membrane.

6 Intended use of the device:

Wondfo Cannabinoids Urine Test and Wondfo Propoxyphene Urine Test are intended for the qualitative determination of 11-nor-Δ9-THC-9-CooH and d-propoxyphene (target analyte) at the specific cut-off concentration in human urine. For in vitro diagnostic use only. Wondfo Propoxyphene Urine Test is only intended for prescription use. Wondfo Cannabinoids Urine Test is intended for over-the-counter and prescription use.

Dear Mr Shia:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Device Name: Wondfo Propoxyphene Urine Test

Indications for Use:

Wondfo Propoxyphene Urine Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative determination o d-Propoxyphene in human urine at a cutoff concentration of 300 ng/mL. The test is available in a dip card format and a cup format. This product is only intended for prescription use.

The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a conformed analytical result. GC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.
