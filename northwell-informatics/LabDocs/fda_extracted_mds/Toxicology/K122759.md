Psychemedics Microplate ElA for Cannabinoids in Hair K111929

Product Description:

The test consists of two parts; a pre-analytical proprietary and patent pending hair treatment procedure (to remove THCA from the solid hair matrix to a measurable liquid matrix), and the screening assay. The screening assay is an Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA).

Sample is added to a well of the micro strip plate and enzyme conjugate is added, followed by incubation. During this phase, the enzyme-labeled drug conjugate competes with drug in the sample for a limited number of binding sites on the rabbit antibody-coated micro wells. The two bind in proportion to their concentrations. A wash solution is applied to remove any unbound materials. Enzyme substrate solution containing a chromagen is added. The reaction is stopped with an acid and the absorbance is read using a plate reader at $4 5 0 n m$ A background reading is also taken at $6 3 0 ~ \mathsf { n m }$ Color intensity is inversely proportional to the amount of drug present in the

sample.

Indication for Use:

The Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assay for Carboxy-THC (THCA) is an in vitro diagnostic test that is intended to be used for the determination of the presence of cannabinoids in human head and body hair samples. The Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assay for Carboxy-THC utilizes the International Diagnostics Systems Corp. enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for THC Metabolite Testing Kit, for the qualitative detection of THCA at or above 1 pg/mg of hair for the purpose of identifying the use of cannabinoids.

The Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assay for Carboxy-THC provides only preliminary analytical test results and must be used in combination with a more specific alternate chemical method in order to obtain a confirmed result. Gas Chromatograph- Mass Spectrometry operating in the selected ion monitoring (SiM) mode or GC/MS/MS in selected reaction mode (SRM) is used as the confirmation method, along with deuterated internal standards.

Omega plans to perform this test at one site. Omega has not performed an evaluation of reproducibility at different laboratories.

All performance studies demonstrated that the Omega assay is in substantial agreement with the predicate products.

Results obtained from donor specimens showed that the qualitative results from the new assays are substantially equivalent to those obtained from the predicate devices.

CALIBRATOR AND CONTROL: The Omega Laboratories, Inc. ELISA Screening Protocol utilizes inhouse prepared calibrator and control solutions. The study demonstrated the validation and stabilityo these solutions along with the traceability to NIST standards.

The study demonstrated the stability of THCA in methanol for a period of six months when stored refrigerated in an amber bottle. The quantitative value afer a six month perid as compared to a fehly prepared solution is within $10 \%$ of the target value of $2 . 5 \ p g / m g$ This validates the six months expiration date for the THCA Stock Solution.

STABILITY: Stability Studies determined whether there are any adverse effects on the level of THCA contained in a hair sample when it is placed in storage for an extended period of time. Two storage time points were used (1 year and 2.5 years)

The Stability Study demonstrated that the mean variance on the concentration of THCA in hair samples when stored for a 1 year period was $- 3 0 . 7 \%$ .

COSMETIC TREATMENT: Numerous studies have demonstrated that the use of cosmetic treatments can reduce the amount of drugs and metabolites detected in hair specimens (see attached references). This effect is completely dependent upon the nature of the hair specimen and the treatment used, and is independent of the method of analysis. This study demonstrates that the Omega Laboratories, Inc.ELISA THCA Screening Protocol is not an exception to this phenomenon.

The Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assay for THCA is substantially equivalent to the predicate Psychemedics Corp Microplate ElA for Cannabinoids in Hair (K111929).
