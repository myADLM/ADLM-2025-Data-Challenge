# Intended Use

# Phenobarbital Assay

The Abbott Phenobarbital assay is for in vitro diagnostic use for the quantitative measurement of phenobarbital in human serum or plasma on the ARCHITECT cSystems. The measurements obtained are used in the diagnosis and treatment of phenobarbital overdose and in monitoring levels of phenobarbital to help ensure appropriate therapy.

# Legally Marketed Device to Which Equivalency is Claimed

The Phenobarbital Assay is substantially equivalent to the previously cleared Abbott Aeroset® Phenobarbital Assay (k993031).

# Device Description

The Phenobarbital Assay kit is supplied ready-to-use in liquid form, for storage at 2 to ${ } ^ { 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } }$ . Each Phenobarbital Assay kit is packaged in a rectangular cardboard box divided into three sections. One section will contain three bottles of Antibody Reagent (R1), one section will contain three bottles of Microparticle Reagent (R2), and the last section will contain the package insert. Each kit is sufficient for 300 tests. The configuration is as follows:

Theassay is based on competition betweendrug in the sample and drug coated onto amicroparticle for antibody binding sites ofthe phenobarbital antibody reagent. Thephenobarbital-coated microparticle reagentis rapidly agglutinated in the presence ofthe anti-phenobarbital antibody reagent andin the absence of any competing drug inthe sample. The rate of absorbancechange is measured photometrically, and isdirectly proportional to the rate ofagglutination of the particles. When asample containing phenobarbital is added,the agglutination reaction is partiallyinhibited, slowing down the rate ofabsorbance change. A concentration-dependent classic agglutination inhibitioncurve can be obtained, with maximum rateof agglutination at the lowest phenobarbitalconcentration and the lowest agglutinationrate at the highest phenobarbitalconcentration.</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>The Phenobarbital assay is ahomogeneous enzyme immunoassaytechnique used for the analysis ofphenobarbital in biological fluids. Theassay is based on competition for antibodybinding sites between the analyte drug inthe specimen and exogenous drug labeledwith the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatedehydrogenase (G6PDH). Since G6PDHactivity decreases upon binding to theantibody, the concentration of drug in thespecimen can be measured in terms ofenzyme activity. Active G6PDH reducesnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) toNADH, resulting in an absorbance changethat is measured spectrophtometrically.Endogenous serum G6PDH does notinterfere because the coenzyme NADfunctions only with the bacterial(Leuconostoc mesenteroides) enzymeemployed in the assay.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample Matrix</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Human Serum or Human Plasma</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Human Serum or Human Plasma</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Reagent</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Liquid Ready-to-Use (Antibody reagent,Phenobarbital-coated microparticlereagent)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Liquid Ready-to-Use (Antibody reagent,Phenobarbital-labeled enzyme reagent)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Storage</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2-8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2-8</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Calibrator</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Liquid Ready-to-Use, six levels (0.0, 5.0,10.0, 20.0, 40.0, and 80.0 µg/mL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Liquid Ready-to-Use, six levels (0.0, 5.0,10.0, 20.0, 40.0, and 80.0 µg/mL)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Assay Range</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.0 to 80.0 μg/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.5 to 80.0 µg/mL</td></tr></table>

# Summary of Performance Testing Limit of Quantitation (LOQ)

The limit of quantitation determines the lowest concentration which results in inter-assay precision at $7 \%$ CV or $0 . 7 ~ \mu \ g / \ m L$ SD and bias to be within $10 \%$ or $1 . 0 ~ \mu \ g / \ m L$ that has been measured over an extended period. The results demonstrate that the LOQ is $2 . 0 \ \mathrm { \mu \ g / m L }$ and meets design acceptance criteria.

# Precision

Phenobarbital samples tested for precision following a CLSl protocol. In the study, the total run $\% 0 \%$ was less than or equal to $6 . 7 \%$ and meets design acceptance criteria.

# Spike Recovery

Negative serum samples were spiked with phenobarbital at concentrations across the assay range. All of the samples recover within $\pm 1 0 \%$ or $\pm 1 . 0 \mu \mathfrak { g } / \mathfrak { m L }$ error of the HPLC results.

# Method Comparison

Samples were tested in the Phenobarbital Assay and compared to HPLC. The assay correlated well with HPLC as follows: $y . = 0 . 9 3 3 x + 0 . 6 8$ $\mathsf { R } = 0 . 9 8 8 7$ $n = 1 0 8$ .

# Matrix Comparison

The following matrices were tested and may be suitable for use in the Phenobarbital Assay: serum in glass, serum in plastic, serum separator tube (SST) in plastic, plasma with sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate in plastic, plasma with sodium heparin in plastic and glass, plasma with lithium heparin in plastic with or without gel, plasma with K3 EDTA in glass and plastic, plasma with K2 EDTA in plastic, and sodium citrate in plastic and glass.

# Specificity

The assay showed minimal to no cross reactivity to other medications potentially administered with phenobarbital. The assay also showed minimal to no interference to endogenous substances up to the concentrations tested.

# Linearity

Samples were tested to demonstrate linearity throughout the assay range. Results demonstrate that the assay performs in a linear fashion from 2.0 to $8 0 ~ \mu \ g / \ m L$ .

# Onboard Stability

Using the Abbott Architect cSystem, the reagents were stable onboard for up to 45 days.

# Standard Curve Calibration Stability

Using the Abbott Architect cSystem, the standard curve calibration was stable for up to 4 days.

# Reagent Shelf Life Stability

Studies showed that the reagents will be stable at $2 . 8 ^ { \circ } C$ for 24 months.

# Conclusion

Substantial equivalence of the Phenobarbital Assay to the previously cleared Abbott Aeroset® Phenobarbital Assay (k993031) has been demonstrated through performance testing (Section 18) to verify that the device functions as intended and design specifications have been satisfied.
