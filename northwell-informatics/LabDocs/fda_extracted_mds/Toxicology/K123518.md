Theassay is based on competition betweendrug in the sample and drug coated onto amicroparticle for antibody binding sites ofthe carbamazepine antibody reagent. Thecarbamazepine-coated microparticlereagent is rapidly agglutinated in thepresence of the anti-carbamazepineantibody reagent and in the absence of anycompeting drug in the sample. The rate ofabsorbance change is measuredphotometrically, and is directly proportionalto the rate of agglutination of the particles.When a sample containing carbamazepineis added, the agglutination reaction ispartially inhibited, slowing down the rate ofabsorbance change. A concentration-dependent classic agglutination inhibitioncurve can be obtained, with maximum rateof agglutination at the lowestcarbamazepine concentration and thelowest agglutination rate at the highestcarbamazepine concentration.</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>The Carbamazepine assay is ahomogeneous enzyme immunoassaytechnique used for the analysis ofcarbamazepine in biological fluids. Theassay is based on competition for antibodybinding sites between the analyte drug inthe specimen and exogenous drug labeledwith the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatedehydrogenase (G6PDH). Since G6PDHactivity decreases upon binding to theantibody, the concentration of drug in thespecimen can be measured in terms ofenzyme activity. Active G6PDH reducesnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) toNADH, resulting in an absorbance changethat is measured spectrophtometrically.Endogenous serum G6PDH does notinterfere because the coenzyme NADfunctions only with the bacterial(Leuconostoc mesenteroides) enzymeemployed in the assay.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sample Matrix</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Human Serum or Human Plasma</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Human Serum or Human Plasma</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Reagent</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Liquid Ready-to-Use (Antibody reagent,Carbamazepine-coated microparticlereagent)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Liquid Ready-to-Use (Antibody reagent,Carbamazepine-labeled enzyme reagent)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Storage</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2-8°C</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2-8°</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Calibrator</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Liquid Ready-to-Use, six levels (0.0, 2.0,4.0, 8.0, 12.0, and 20.0 µg/mL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Liquid Ready-to-Use, six levels (0.0, 2.0,4.0, 8.0, 12.0, and 20.0 µg/mL)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Assay Range</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.9 to 20.0 µg/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.5 to 20.0 µg/mL</td></tr></table>

# Summary of Performance Testing Functional Sensitivity (LOQ)

Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) determines the lowest concentration which results a CV of inter assay precision at $7 \%$ that has been measured over an extended period. The results demonstrate that the LOQ is $1 . 9 \mu g / m L$ and meet design acceptance criteria.

# Precision

Carbamazepine samples tested for precision following a CLSl protocol. In the study, the total run $\% C V$ was less than or equal to $6 . 3 \%$ and meets design acceptance criteria.

# Spike Recovery

Negative serum samples were spiked with carbamazepine at concentrations across the assay range. All of the samples recover within $\pm 1 0 \%$ or $\pm 0 . 4 \mu g / m L$ error of the HPLC results.

# Method Comparison

Samples were tested in the Carbamazepine Assay and compared to HPLC and Aeroset Carbamazepine Assay (k993028). The assay correlated well with HPLC as follows: $\ y = 1 . 0 9 3 x$ $\pm \ 0 . 3 7 2$ , $\mathsf { R } = 0 . 9 5 8 4$ $n = 1 0 5$ . The assay also correlated well with the Aeroset Carbamazepine Assay as follows: $y = 0 . 9 0 5 x + 0 . 5 6 4$ , $R = 0 . 9 6 7 5$ , $n = 1 0 3$ .

# Matrix Comparison

The following matrices were tested and may be suitable for use in the Carbamazepine Assay: serum in glass, serum in plastic, serum separator tube (SST) in plastic, plasma with sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate in plastic, plasma with sodium heparin in plastic and glass, plasma with lithium heparin in plastic with or without gel, plasma with K3 EDTA in glass and plastic, plasma with K2 EDTA in plastic, and sodium citrate in plastic and glass.

# Specificity

The assay showed minimal to no cross reactivity to other medications potentially administered with carbamazepine. The assay also showed minimal to no interference to endogenous substances up to the concentrations tested.

# Linearity

Samples were tested to demonstrate linearity throughout the assay range. Results demonstrate that the assay performs in a linear fashion from 0.5 to $2 0 \mu \ g / \mathrm { m L }$ .

# Onboard Stability

Using the Abbott Architect cSystem, the reagents were stable onboard for up to 45 days.

# Standard Curve Calibration Stability

Using the Abbott Architect cSystem, the standard curve calibration was stable for up to 7 days.

# Reagent Shelf Life Stability

Studies showed that the reagents will be stable at ${ 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ for 24 months.

# Conclusion

Substantial equivalence of the Abbott Carbamazepine Assay to the previously cleared Abbott Aeroset® Carbamazepine Assay (k993028) has. been demonstrated through performance testing (Section 18) to verify that the device functions as intended and design specifications have been satisfied.
