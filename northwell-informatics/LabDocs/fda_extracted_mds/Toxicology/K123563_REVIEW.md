# L. Test Principle:

The LeadCare Ultra System Blood Lead Testing System is an in vitro diagnostic device that relies on electrochemistry (Anodic Stripping Voltammetry or ASV) and a unique sensor to detect lead in whole blood. Most lead is carried within red blood cells. When a sample of whole blood is mixed with Treatment Reagent (a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid), the red blood cells are lysed and the lead becomes available for detection. When a test is run, the analyzer applies an electrical potential that causes the lead to collect on the Sensor. The analyzer measures the amount of lead on the Sensor and displays the result in micrograms per deciliter.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The LeadCare Ultra Precision Study was performed using bovine blood standards at lead concentrations across the measuring range of the assay. Eighty (80) data points were collected per concentration level over a 20 day period. Samples were prepped two times per day and each sample was run in duplicate on alternating channels such that all (6) channels were used equally during the study. For concentrations around 4.5, 6.4 and $6 2 . 1 \ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ , three sensor lots were utilized. For the remaining concentrations, one representative sensor lot was used. The combined data set is shown below for within-run and total precision:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A total of seven serially diluted concentrations were tested on three Sensor lots using nine donor blood samples spiked with lead concentrations of 2-5, 5-10, 15-25, 25-35, 35-45, 45-55 & $5 5 { - } 6 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ to examine the linearity of the study.

The following are linear regression results: Sensor lot ${ \mathrm { ! } } { \mathrm { Y } } = 1 . 0 4 { \mathrm { x } }$ - 1. 17, $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 7$ Sensor lot 2: $\mathrm {  ~ Y ~ } = 1 . 1 0 \mathrm {  ~ x ~ }$ - 1.71, $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 6$ Sensor lot 3: Y = 1.04x - 0.58, $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 8$

The data provided support the sponsor’s claim that the measuring range of this assay is 1.9 to $6 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The controls supplied in the Test Kit are the same controls (2 levels of external liquid control) already in use by the predicate device. The controls received FDA clearance under k063398. Please see k063398 for controls information.

LeadCare $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Ultra™ Blood Lead Analyzer contains a featured Calibration Button Reader. This Reader allows for the download of all calibration information, analytical test parameters, and date code information for any given Sensor lot. The Calibration Button is supplied with each test kit.

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were calculated based on CLSI EP17-A.

Six sample preps of the blank sample were prepared daily. Replicates of the blank samples were run on the LeadCare Ultra Analyzer over five days using two Sensor lots across all (6) analyzer channels. The limit of blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined by measuring 70 replicates of near blank NIST blood samples $( 0 . 3 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L } )$ .

The LoB was calculated to be $1 . 5 \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$

For LoD determination, seventy data points of the low sample were used to calculate the LoD based on the following equation:   
$\mathrm { L o D } = \mathrm { L o B } + 1 . 6 4 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ S D }$ of low samples   
The LoD was calculated to be $1 . 9 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ .

To calculate the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the LeadCare Ultra Analyzer, 58 whole blood samples were collected in EDTA Vacutainers with blood lead values at the range $( 1 - 6 ~ \mu \ g / \mathrm { d L } )$ . The limit of quantification LoQ was calculated using the Total Error equation:

Total Error LoQ $=$ absolute (Bias) + (2 x SD).

The bias of 58 samples, according to GFAAS, was calculated to be $0 . 0 2 { \mathrm { ~ g / d L } }$ .

Based upon the results, the sponsor claims the $\mathrm { L o Q } = \mathrm { L o D } \left( { 1 . 9 \mu { \bf g } } / { \mathrm { d L } } \right)$

# e. Analytical specificity:

Each compound was tested for specificity with certain compounds and drug metabolites. Each compound was spiked into drug-free blood.

Each sample was tested in 3 replicates and was run on 3 sensors. If any positive result was observed, the compound, drug/drug metabolites were further diluted sequentially to different concentrations and tested in triplicates until the highest concentrations that generates negative results were determined. A summary of the interference study is presented in the product package insert. Results are shown below for the tested concentration of each compound that resulted in no interference.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A study was performed to compare the results of the LeadCare Ultra test to the Reference Method, Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (GFAAS) using 148 whole blood samples in K2EDTA Vacutainers based on

CLSI EP9-A2 guidelines. Each blood sample was run once on the LeadCare Ultra and in duplicate on the GFAAS. The range of results observed with the LeadCare Ultra test ranged from 1.9 to $6 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ . Results of linear regression are as follows:

$$
\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 8 9 \mathrm { X } + 0 . 0 0 6 6 , \mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 7 8 .
$$

$b$ . Matrix comparison:

A total of 72 micro capillary tubes with K2EDTA samples (fingerstick) with lead concentration of 1.9, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, $6 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ , and 39 pairs (EDTA and sodium heparin vacutainer samples) with lead concentration of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, $6 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ were analyzed on the LeadCare Ultra system compared to GFAAS.
