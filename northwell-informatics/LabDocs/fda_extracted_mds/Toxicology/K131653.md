# Legally Marketed Predicate Device(s)

The LZI Oral Fluid Amphetamine Enzyme Immunoassay (k131653) is substantially equivalent to the Lin-Zhi International, Inc. Oral Fluid Amphetamine Enzyme Immunoassay, Calibrators and Controls for Hitachi 717 Systems (k063024) manufactured by Lin-Zhi International, Inc. The LZl Oral Fluid Amphetamine Enzyme Immunoassay is identical or similar to its predicate in terms of intended use, method principle, device components, and clinical performance.

# Device Description

The LZI Oral Fluid Amphetamine assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay with ready-touse liquid reagent. The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for a fixed amount of antibody in the reagent. Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, and the drug concentration in the sample is measured in terms of enzyme activity. In the absence of drug in the sample, amphetamine-labeled G6PDH conjugate is bound to antibody, and the enzyme activity is inhibited.On the other hand, when free drug is present in the sample, antibody would bind to free drug, the unbound amphetamine-labeled G6PDH then exhibits its maximal enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH, resulting in an absorbance change that can be measured spectrophotometrically at $3 4 0 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ .

The LZl Oral Fluid Amphetamine Enzyme Immunoassay is a kit comprised of two reagents, ar $\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ and $\mathrm { R } _ { 2 }$ which are bottled separately but sold together within the kit.

The $\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ solution contains mouse monoclonal anti-amphetamine antibody, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), stabilizers, and sodium azide $( 0 . 0 9 \% )$ as a preservative. The ${ \sf R } _ { 2 }$ solution contains glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) labeled with amphetamine in buffer with sodium azide $( 0 . 0 9 \% )$ as preservative.

The LZI Oral Fluid Amphetamine Enzyme Immunoassay calibrators and controls designated for use at the ${ \mathfrak { s o n g / m L } }$ cutoffs contain 0, 25, 37.5, 50, 62.5, 100, and $1 4 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ of d-amphetamine in human oral fluid with sodium azide $( 0 . 0 9 \% )$ as preservative. These five calibrators and two controls are sold as individual bottles.

The LZI Oral Fluid Collector is a $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ polypropylene collection tube. It is a non-sterile centrifuge tube with a screw-on cap and printed graduations (United Lab Plastics, Catalog#UP2262).

# Intended Use

The LZI Oral Fluid Amphetamine Enzyme Immunoassay is intended for the qualitative and semi-quantitative determination of d-amphetamine in neat human oral fluid, collected into the LZI Oral Fluid Collector, at the cutoff value $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The assay is designed for prescription use with a number of automated clinical chemistry analyzers.

The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of (1) enabling laboratories to determine an appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as GCMS and LCMS or (2) permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.

The LZl Oral Fluid Amphetamine Calibrators are for use as calibrators in the qualitative and semi-quantitative calibration of the LZI Oral Fluid Amphetamine Enzyme Immunoassay at the cutoff value $\mathsf { 5 0 n g / m L }$ .

The LZl Oral Fluid Amphetamine Controls are for use as assayed quality control materials to monitor the precision of the LZl Oral Fluid Amphetamine Enzyme Immunoassay at the cutoff value of $5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

The assay provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas. or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS or LC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method). Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary test result is positive.

Dear Dr. Lin:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note:CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

If you desire speciic advice for your device on our labeling regulations (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809), please contact the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638 2041 or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/lndustry/default.htm.Also, please note the regulation entitled. "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to   
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH's Office of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.
