# L. Test Principle:

The RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for THC is an in vitro diagnostic competitive immunoassay used to detect THC in human oral fluid. This is a ready-to-use homogenous system that involves energy transfer between an acceptor fluorophore labeled to an antibody and a donor fluorophore labeled to drug. The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the donor fluorophore for a fixed number of binding sites on the antibody reagent. When acceptor and donor fluorophores are brought into close proximity through a binding event, energy transfer occurs. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal is measured at the wavelength of the acceptor fluorophore and is inversely proportional to the amount of drug in the sample. A Cutoff Calibrator is used to translate the sample measurement into a positive or negative result. Controls are used to establish and monitor precision and accuracy.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not Applicable. This is a qualitative assay c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability:

The cutoff calibrators and controls are prepared by spiking known concentrations of THC into synthetic oral fluid to obtain the cutoff level of the calibrator and the positive and negative controls. The negative calibrator is drug free synthetic oral fluid. Calibrators and controls are prepared from $\Delta 9$ -Tetrahydrocannabinol from a commercial vendor that uses NIST traceable weights and specific assays such as HPLC and GC/MS to confirm drug levels.

# Value Assignment-Calibrators and Controls

Calibrator and control lots are value assigned during the manufacturing process in two stages. During the first stage following bottling and labeling, new lots are assayed against at least one previously accepted, released and unexpired Calibrator and Control lot using RapidFRET reagents. Results are qualitatively evaluated for performance relative to the previously accepted lots. During the second stage, each new manufactured lot of Calibrator (Cutoff only) or Control (POS and NEG) is quantitatively confirmed by MS based method for target analyte concentration. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.

# Stability-Calibrators and Controls

Real-time stability studies were conducted on multiple lots of calibrators and controls. The stability protocol was reviewed and found acceptable. The testing supports the stability at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ for 12 months for closed vial and 30 days for open vial for both the RapidFret Oral Fluid THC Calibrator Set and RapidFret Oral Fluid THC Control Set.

# Shipment Stability:

Neat oral fluid pool was spiked with THC to $0 \%$ , $+ / - 2 5 \% , + / - 5 0 \% , + / - 7 5 \%$ , $100 \%$ , of cutoff. Each spike was processed through a RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collection device to mimic actual collection process as close as possible. Aliquots were stored and handled according to the collector insert. Samples were shipped at ambient temperature from California to Maine and back again multiple times. Samples were assayed using the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for THC before and after each shipment. At various time points, aliquots were reserved and analyzed quantitatively by a MS based method. During the 17 day study, temperatures ranged from approximately $4 { - } 3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and the relative humidity (RH) ranged from $7 \%$ to $100 \%$ . Recoveries comparing pre-shipping concentrations vs. post-shipping concentrations ranged from $9 0 . 1 \%$ to $1 0 7 . 7 \%$ .

# Sample Storage and Stability:

Conditions for oral fluid sample handling and storage was evaluated by spiking oral fluid samples with THC from $0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ to $8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ in approximately $1 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ increments. Samples were processed through RapidEASE oral fluid collection devices and stored under various conditions including room temperature, refrigerated $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and frozen (-10 to $- 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ). Samples were periodically sampled and analyzed by RapidFRET and mass spectrometry. For each storage condition two sets of spikes of 9 levels each were prepared and analyzed in tandem. Recovery for refrigerated samples ranged from $9 1 . 5 \%$ to $100 \%$ , and for frozen samples ranged from $10 8 \%$ to $1 1 4 \%$ . Samples are stable for up to 7 days at room temperature, up to 21 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ }$ C, and up to six months at $- 1 0$ to $- 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

A sample recovery study was performed in which approximately $6 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ of neat, human oral fluid pool was aliquoted into glass tubes and spiked with THC to concentrations ranging from approximately $0 \%$ of cutoff $\mathrm { ( 0 \ n g / m L ) }$ to $20 \%$ cutoff (8 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } ) }$ in five replicates for each spike level. Approximately half of the volume of each of these samples were then processed through a RapidEASE Collector to mimic real life use. Both the Pre-RapidEASE and Post-RapidEASE sample for each spike level were confirmed for THC concentration by mass spectrometry. Recovery ranged from $9 8 . 7 \%$ to $1 0 3 . 4 \%$ for all of the THC concentrations. Results are summarized in the table below:

f. Assay cut-off:

Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff concentration appears in the precision section, M.1.a. above.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Neat oral fluid was collected with the RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector from volunteers potentially positive and negative for THC. Samples were handled according to RapidEASE protocols including 7 days at ambient temperature (including shipping), refrigerated up to 30 days and the frozen at $\mathbf { \Omega } _ { - 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ to $- 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until testing. A total of 236 samples were randomized and blind to the instrument operator and assayed using the RapidFRET THC reagents and the comparative method GC/MS. Of the sample population, 122 $( 5 2 \% )$ contained no THC, 114 $( 4 8 \% )$ contained detectable amounts of THC with 26 samples $( 2 3 \% )$ containing THC levels near the cutoff. The results are summarized in the table below.
