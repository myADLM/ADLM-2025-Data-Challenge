# 5.0 Device Description

Technopath has developed whole blood control materials prepared from human whole blood, to which whole blood purified biochemical material (extracts of human origin), chemicals, drugs, preservatives and stabilizers have been added. Three levels of control are available to allow performance monitoring within the analytical range.

Each donor unit used in the preparation of the control material was tested by United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved methods and found to be negative for antibodies to HIV and HCV, and nonreactive for HBsAg; However, because no test method can offer complete assurance that HIV, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus or other infectious agents are absent, this material should be handled as though capable of transmitting infectious diseases. This product may also contain other human source material for which there is no approved test. It is recommended that this material be handled in accordance with the OSHA Standard on Blood borne Pathogens.

# 6.0 Intended Use

The Multichem WBT control is intended for use as an assayed quality control material to monitor the precision of laboratory testing procedures for the analytes listed in the package insert. The Multichem WBT control consists of 3 different levels of control solutions prepared from human whole blood.

# 8.2 Value Assignment Summary

Value assignment testing was internally performed and utilized internal procedures and protocols to determine typical values that would be seen for the product across Abbott ARCHITECT $\mathrm { i } 2 0 \mathrm { \dot { 0 } \dot { 0 } }$ chemistry system with the associated reagent test systems. For the Multichem WBT control, 2 reagent lots and 2 calibrator lots were used to incorporate reagent and calibrator variation. 2 replicates from 16 runs were performed to give a total of 32 data points. Distinct runs, with minimum gaps of 2 hours were performed and a minimum of 8 calibration events were performed to incorporate variation from calibration and environmental sources. Value assignment ranges were established at the predetermined criteria of $30 \%$ around the grand mean to ensure that 3SD's either side of the mean were within the established range. Values for the lots tested all fell within the established ranges.

# 8.3 Stability Testing Summary

Stability studies have been performed to determine the open vial stability and shelf-life for this control. For open vial stability, Technopath utilized internal procedures and Isochronous - Staggered Start [Backwards / Back-ended] method from CLSI EP25A entitled "Evaluation of Stability of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents." To minimize variation, where possible, one lot of reagent, calibrator and reference/control was used for the entire study, per analyte. Testing was performed over multiple days on 1 Abbott ARCHITECT $\mathsf { i } 2 0 0 0 ^ { \mathfrak { W } }$ instrument with the associated reagent test systems. All Multichem WBT analytes for open vial testing used freshly thawed vial samples that were tested in replicates of 3 at each time point. Multiple time points were tested and the point of failure was determined by the maximum allowable drift (degradation), which was determined to be $10 \%$ .

Product claims are as follows:

Open Vial Stability:

• Tacrolimus and Cyclosporine 10 days at 2 to ${ \pmb 8 } ^ { \circ } { \bf C }$ Sirolimus 7 days at 2 to ${ \bf 8 ^ { o } C }$

TECHNOPATH

A combination of accelerated and real-time testing was carried out utilizing CLSl EP25A in order to support a shelf-life storage claim of $\cdot 2 0 ^ { \circ }$ to $- 8 0 ^ { \circ } C$ for 30 months. The accelerated testing utilized three lots of controls and the preliminary real-time testing utilized three lots of controls. All data was generated using the Abbott ARCHITECT $\mathsf { i } 2 0 0 0 ^ { \mathfrak { P } }$ instrument with the associated reagent test systems. For the Multichem WBT control, the Drift Limit was determined to be $10 \%$ These results concluded that the Multichem WBT control product is predicted to be stable for in excess of 30 months when stored at $\bf { \Omega } { \bf { 2 0 ^ { \circ } C } }$ to $- 8 0 \%$ The real-time testing is on-going.

Product claims are as follows:

Storage (Closed/Shelf-Life): • 30 months at $\cdot 2 0 ^ { \circ }$ to $\mathbf { - 8 0 \% }$

# 9.0 Conclusion:

The conclusions drawn from the nonclinical tests (discussed above) demonstrate that the Multichem WBT control is as safe, as effective, and performs as well as the predicate device. The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
