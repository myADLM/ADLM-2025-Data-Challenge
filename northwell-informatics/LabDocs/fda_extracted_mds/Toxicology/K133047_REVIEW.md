# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced.

# L. Test Principle:

The RapidFRET $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Oral Fluid Assay for MDMA is a ready-to-use homogenous immunoassay that involves energy transfer between an acceptor fluorophore labeled to an antibody and a donor fluorophore labeled to drug. The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the donor fluorophore for a fixed number of binding sites on the antibody reagent. When acceptor and donor fluorophores are brought into close proximity through a binding event, energy transfer occurs. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal is measured at the wavelength of the acceptor fluorophore following excitation of the donor and is inversely proportional to the amount of drug in the sample. A Cutoff Calibrator is used to translate the sample measurement into a positive or negative result. Controls are used to monitor the precision and accuracy of the assay.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Three lots of the RapidFRET MDMA were analyzed, four times daily, for a minimum of 20 days. Negative oral fluid pools were spiked with MDMA at $0 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $7 5 \%$ , $100 \%$ , $12 5 \%$ , $1 5 0 \%$ , $1 7 5 \%$ and $20 \%$ of the cutoff level of $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and were processed through the RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collection device. Oral fluid spikes were derived from NIST weight traceable standards and confirmed for drug levels using quantitative methods including GC/MS or LC/MS/MS.

The percentage of negative and positive results was consistent across the three lots tested. Representative data from one lot is summarized below. Precision data from this lot was collected over 36 days total with 24 data collection days. Two professional laboratory operators were used to collect this data.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability – Calibrators and Controls

Calibrators and controls are ready-to-use synthetic oral fluid solutions. The cutoff calibrator and controls are prepared by spiking known concentrations of MDMA into synthetic oral fluid to obtain the cutoff level calibrator, and the positive and negative controls. The negative calibrator is drug free synthetic oral fluid.

Calibrators and controls are prepared from $( \pm ) - 3 , 4 -$ methylenedioxymethamphetamine $\mathrm { 1 ~ m g / m L }$ in methanol) commercial primary standards from a vendor that uses NIST traceable weights and specific assays, such as HPLC and GC/MS, to confirm drug levels.

Stability - Calibrators and Controls

Real-time stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The shelf life (closed-vial) claim for the calibrators and controls is 12 months when stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The opened-vial claim for the calibrators and controls is 30 days when stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Value Assignment – Calibrators and Controls

Calibrator and Control lots are value assigned during the manufacturing process in two steps. First, following bottling and labeling, new lots are assayed against at least one previously accepted, released and unexpired Calibrator and Control lot using RapidFRET reagents. Results are qualitatively evaluated for performance relative to the previously accepted lots. Second, each new manufactured lot of Calibrator (Cutoff only) or Control (POS and NEG) is quantitatively confirmed by mass spectrometry (MS)-based method for target analyte concentration. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.

# Sample Shipping - Stability Study

Neat oral fluid pool was spiked with MDMA to $0 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $7 5 \%$ , $100 \%$ , $12 5 \%$ , $1 5 0 \%$ , $1 7 5 \%$ and $20 \%$ of the cutoff. Each spike was subsequently processed through a RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collection device to mimic actual collection process. Aliquots were stored and handled according to the collector insert. Samples were shipped multiple times at ambient temperature from California to Maine and back to California. Samples were assayed using the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for MDMA before and after each shipment. At various time points, aliquots were reserved and analyzed quantitatively by a MS-based method. The physical integrity of the RapidEASE sample tube was also evaluated following each shipment.

During the 17-day study, temperature ranged from approximately $4 - 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and relative humidity range between $7 \%$ and $100 \%$ . The percent change vs. Day 1 (before shipping) ranged from $9 7 . 9 \%$ to $1 0 6 . 3 \%$ . No signs of sample tube degradation or performance loss were noted during the study. The data support the sponsor’s claimed shipping stability of up to 7 days.

# Sample Stability Study

Oral fluid samples with MDMA from 0 to approximately $20 \%$ of the cutoff were prepared in approximately $2 5 \%$ increments and processed through RapidEASE oral fluid collection devices. Samples were stored under various conditions including room temperature, refrigerated $( 2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and frozen (-10 to $- 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ). Samples were periodically removed and analyzed by RapidFRET and mass spectrometry. For each storage condition two sets of spikes of 9 levels each were prepared and analyzed in tandem.

Recovery for samples stored at room temperature ranged from $9 5 . 4 \%$ to $1 0 0 . 2 \%$ . Recovery for refrigerated samples ranged from $9 5 . 0 \%$ to $1 0 3 . 7 \%$ , and for frozen samples ranged from $1 0 3 . 5 \%$ to $1 1 0 . 4 \%$ . Samples are stable for up to 7 days at room temperature, up to 21 days at $2 - 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { \ i } }$ , and up to six months at -10 to ${ } - 2 5 \ { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# Sample Recovery Study

Recovery studies were conducted by aliquoting neat, human oral fluid pool into glass tubes and spiking with MDMA to achieve concentrations ranging from 0 to $20 \%$ of cutoff $( 1 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L ) }$ in 5 replicates for each level in $2 5 \%$ ( $1 2 . 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ) increments. Approximately half of the volume of each of these ‘PRE-RapidEASE’ samples was then removed and processed through a new RapidEASE Oral Fluid collector, mimicking as close as possible actual collection protocol, resulting in a ‘POSTRapidEASE’ sample. Both the PRE-RapidEASE and POST-RapidEASE for each spike level was confirmed for MDMA concentration by mass spectrometry. Recoveries from individual samples ranged from $9 3 . 2 \%$ to $1 0 8 . 3 \%$ . Average spike recovery at each level ranged from $9 5 . 6 \%$ to $1 0 1 . 7 \%$ .

To evaluate the effect of endogenous substances, $\mathrm { p H }$ , food, drinks, medications, and tobacco products that may be present in oral fluid samples, aliquots of a neat oral fluid pool were prepared and spiked with the potential interferent and MDMA to achieve approximately $+ / -$ $50 \%$ of the cutoff. Samples were then processed through a RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector and analyzed. No negative or positive interference was observed in this study.

Labeling indicates that there is a possibility that other substances and/or factors not listed above may interfere with the test and cause false results.

f. Assay cut-off:

Analytical performance of the device around the cutoff is described in the precision section M.1.a. above.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Neat oral fluid was collected with the RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector from volunteers potentially positive and negative for MDMA. Samples were handled according to RapidEASE protocols including 7 days at ambient temperature

(including shipping), refrigerated for up to 30 days and then frozen at ${ } _ { - 1 0 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to -25 $^ \circ C$ until testing.

The samples were randomized and blinded to the instrument operator and assayed using the RapidFRET MDMA assay and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS). A total of 308 samples were analyzed for MDMA content and the results are summarized below:
