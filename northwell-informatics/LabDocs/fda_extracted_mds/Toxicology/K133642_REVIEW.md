The RapidFRET Oral Fluid Calibrator Set and RapidFRET Oral Fluid Control Set are intended for use only with the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Opiates and samples collected with the RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector. The cutoff calibrator is used to determine the cutoff level and translate the assay measurement into a positive or negative result. The positive and negative controls are used to monitor laboratory systems, operators, precision, accuracy and assay conditions. For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

For prescription use in Central Laboratories.

The assay is not intended for use in point-of-care settings.

4. Special instrument requirements: For use with the RapidFRET Integrated Workstation.

# I. Device Description:

# Reagents:

The RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Opiates is sold as a kit in two sizes. Each kit consists of 96 Well Microtiter Plates (round bottom plates), Acceptor Reagent A (Opiates specific antibody conjugated to an acceptor fluorophore in buffer with preservative), Multi-Donor Reagent (Donor fluorophore conjugated to drug derivative in buffer with preservative) and Matrix Blank Reagent.

The assay procedure involves mixing an antibody-acceptor reagent and sample followed by the addition of an opiate-donor conjugate. After completion of the mixing and incubation procedures, the plate is inserted into a plate reader capable of time-resolved fluorescence mode and the FRET is monitored at the emission wavelength of the acceptor. The assay utilizes a matrix blank well consisting of each sample and competitive reagent B, and is used to correct for sample variation.

Calibrators and Controls Sets:

The Calibrators and Controls Sets are required for running the assay and are purchased separately from the Assay Kit. The Calibrators contain synthetic oral fluid with either no Morphine (Negative) or Morphine at $4 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (Cutoff). The Controls contain synthetic oral fluid with Morphine at $1 5 0 \%$ $\mathrm { \langle 6 0 \ n g / m L \rangle }$ ) or $50 \%$ $2 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ of the Cutoff level.

Cutoff and negative calibrators are run at the same time as the unknown samples and are required for identifying presumptive positive and negative samples. The sample measurement is considered preliminary positive if it is less than the cutoff calibrator reading, and negative if it is above the cutoff calibrator reading. Controls are used to monitor precision, accuracy and overall performance of the test system.

The RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector for collection, transportation, sampling and storage of a neat oral fluid sample was previously cleared under k122703. The RapidFRET Integrated Workstation was previously cleared under k122703.

# L. Test Principle:

The RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for OPIATES is an in vitro diagnostic competitive immunoassay used to detect opiates in human oral fluid. This is a ready-to-use homogenous system that involves energy transfer between an acceptor fluorophore labeled to an antibody and a donor fluorophore labeled to drug. The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the donor fluorophore for a fixed number of binding sites on the antibody reagent. When acceptor and donor fluorophores are brought into close proximity through a binding event, energy transfer occurs. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal is measured at the wavelength of the acceptor fluorophore and is inversely proportional to the amount of drug in the sample. A Cutoff Calibrator is used to translate the sample measurement into a positive or negative result. Controls are used to establish and monitor precision and accuracy.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# 1. Analytical performance:

All performance testing of the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Opiates was performed on the RapidFRET Integrated Workstation.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable. The candidate device is a qualitative assay.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability

The cutoff calibrator and controls are prepared by spiking known concentrations of Morphine into synthetic oral fluid to obtain the cutoff level calibrator $\mathrm { \Delta ( 4 0 . 0 ~ n g / m L ) }$ , and the positive $\left( 6 0 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } \right)$ and negative (20.0 $\mathrm { n g / m L ) }$ controls. The negative ( $\mathrm { 0 n g / m L } )$ calibrator is drug free synthetic oral fluid. Calibrators and controls are prepared from primary standards (Morphine at $1 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ in methanol) purchased from a commercial vendor that uses NIST traceable weights and specific assays, such as HPLC and GC/MS to confirm drug levels.

# Value Assignment – Calibrators and Controls

Calibrator and Control lots are value assigned during the manufacturing process in two stages. During the first stage new lots are assayed against a minimum of one previously accepted, released and unexpired Calibrator and Control lot using RapidFRET reagents. During the second stage, each new manufactured accepted lot of Cutoff Calibrator, and of both Positive and Negative Controls is quantitatively confirmed by MS based method for target analyte concentration, and released only if the Sponsor’s acceptance criteria are met.

# Calibrators and Controls Stability Studies

Real-time stability studies were conducted on multiple lots of RapidFRET Oral Fluid Calibrators and RapidFRET Oral Fluid Controls. The stability protocols for open and closed vial were reviewed and found acceptable. The open vial and closed vial study results support the open vial stability claim of 30 days and closed vial stability claim of 12 months when stored at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Calibrators and RapidFRET Oral Fluid Controls.

# Sample Shipment - Stability Studies

A neat oral fluid pool was spiked with Morphine to $0 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $7 5 \%$ , $100 \%$ , $12 5 \%$ , $1 5 0 \%$ , $1 7 5 \%$ and $20 \%$ of cutoff corresponding to approximately 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and $8 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ concentration of Morphine. Each spike was subsequently processed through a RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collection device to mimic the actual collection process as closely as possible. Aliquots were stored and handled according to the collection device insert. Samples were shipped at ambient temperature ( $4 \%$ to $3 0 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C }$ ) and at low to high relative humidity conditions ( $7 \%$ to $100 \%$ R.H.) from California to Maine multiple times by FedEx Standard Overnight Express over 7 to 17 days using two sets of samples (one set shipped at high R.H. and second set shipped at low R.H.). Samples were assayed using the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for OPIATES before and after each shipment. In addition, at various time points, aliquots were reserved and analyzed quantitatively by a mass spectrophotometry based method. The physical integrity of the RapidEASE sample tube was also evaluated following each shipment. The mass spectrometric quantitative results for high R.H. and low R.H. exposed samples were consistent with RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Opiates results. Percent recoveries (at various time points compared to time before shipping) ranged from $9 6 . 2 \%$ to $1 0 7 . 7 \%$ and $9 1 . 5 \%$ to $1 0 7 . 2 \%$ for the samples exposed to high RH and low RH conditions respectively.

# Sample handling and Storage - Stability Studies

Conditions for oral fluid sample handling and storage were evaluated by preparing oral fluid samples with Morphine from approximately $0 \%$ Cutoff (0 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } ) }$ to $20 \%$ Cutoff $\mathrm { ( 8 0 \ n g / m L ) }$ in approximately $2 5 \%$ increments. Samples were processed through RapidEASE oral fluid collection devices and stored under various conditions including room temperature ( $2 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $2 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) for 14 days, refrigerated ( $3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $7 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C }$ ) for 59 days, and frozen ( $- 1 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to $- 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) for 294 days (MS data) and for 383 days (by RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Opiates). Samples were periodically sampled and analyzed by RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Opiates and mass spectrometry. For each storage condition two sets of spiked samples of 9 levels each were prepared and analyzed in tandem. Frozen storage studies are ongoing. Percent recoveries ranged from $8 9 . 3 \%$ to $1 0 8 . 2 \%$ after storage at room temperature for 14 days, $9 2 . 8 \%$ to $1 0 4 . 4 \%$ after 59 days of refrigeration, and $9 3 . 0 \%$ to $1 0 2 . 8 \%$ freezing for 294 days. Based on the sample handling and storage study results, the sponsor has included the following statement in the labeling, “Room temperature storage for up to 7 days, refrigerated storage $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) up to 30 days and frozen storage (- $- 1 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to $- 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) for up to 12 months.”

# Sample Recovery Study

Recovery studies were conducted by aliquoting neat, human oral fluid pool into glass tubes and spiking with Morphine to achieve concentrations ranging from $0 \%$ of cutoff $( 0 \mathrm { n g / m L ) }$ to $20 \%$ of cutoff ( $\mathrm { 8 0 n g / m L }$ in replicates of five for each level in increments of $2 5 \%$ ( $1 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Approximately half of the volume of each of these ‘PRE-RapidEASE’ samples was then removed and processed through a new RapidEASE Oral Fluid collector, mimicking as closely as possible the actual sample collection protocol, resulting in a ‘PRERapidEASE’ sample. The concentration of Morphine in both the PRERapidEASE and the POST-RapidEASE samples for each spike level were measured by Mass Spectrometry. The results are summarized below:

# Potential Interferents and Common Substances

An interference study was performed to evaluate potential interference from endogenous substances, $\mathrm { p H }$ , foods, soft drinks, hot drinks, commonly used over-the-counter medications, tobacco products, dental products, etc. that may be present in the oral fluid samples. Aliquots of a neat oral fluid pool were spiked with the potential interferents (at concentrations shown in the table below) and with morphine $3 t \pm 5 0 \%$ of the Cutoff level, processed through a RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector, and screened using the candidate device. Results showed that all samples spiked at $50 \%$ of cutoff tested negative, and all samples spiked at $1 5 0 \%$ of cutoff tested positive.

# f. Assay cut-off:

Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff concentration of $4 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ Morphine is described in the precision section, M.1.a. above.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Neat oral fluid was collected with the RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector from volunteers potentially positive and negative for various opiates. Samples were handled according to RapidEASE protocols including 7 days at ambient temperature (including shipping), refrigerated for up to 30 days and then frozen at $\mathrm { - 1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C }$ to $- 2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until testing. The samples were randomized and blinded to the instrument operator and assayed using the candidate device and the comparative mass spectroscopy (MS) based quantitative methods. A total of 245 samples were analyzed by MS-based methods for opiate content (including morphine, codeine and hydrocodone). Summary data based on opiate content of the samples is presented in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>b</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>NegativeAs determined bythe predicatedevice or lessthan half thecutoffconcentration byGC/MS analysis</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Near CutoffNegativeBetween50% below thecutoff and thecutoffconcentration</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Near CutoffPositiveBetween thecutoff and 50%above thecutoffconcentration</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>High PositiveGreater than50% above thecutoffconcentration</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Positive</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>53</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Negative</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>177</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0</td></tr></table>
