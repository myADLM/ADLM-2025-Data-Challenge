# L. Test Principle:

The RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Amphetamine is an In Vitro Diagnostic competitive immunoassay used to detect amphetamine in human oral fluid. This is a ready-to-use homogenous system that involves energy transfer between an acceptor fluorophore labeled to an mouse monoclonal antibody and a donor fluorophore labeled to drug. The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the donor fluorophore for a fixed number of binding sites on the antibody reagent. When acceptor and donor fluorophores are brought into close proximity through a binding event, energy transfer occurs. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal is measured at the wavelength of the acceptor fluorophore and is inversely proportional to the amount of drug in the sample. A Cutoff Calibrator is used to translate the sample measurement into a positive or negative result. Controls are used to establish and monitor precision and accuracy.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# 1. Analytical performance:

All performance testing of the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Opiates was performed on the RapidFRET Integrated Workstation.

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A precision study was performed using three lots of the RapidFRET Amphetamine assay. Negative oral fluid pools were spiked with amphetamine at $0 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $7 5 \%$ , $100 \%$ , $12 5 \%$ , $1 5 0 \%$ , $1 7 5 \%$ and $20 \%$ of the cutoff level of $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . These samples were processed through the RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector and analyzed four times daily for a minimum of 20 days by two laboratory operators. The drug levels in the spiked samples were confirmed by quantitative methods, GC/MS or LC/MS/MS.

Representative data from one lot is summarized in the table below. The percentage of negative and positive results was consistent across the three lots tested. Precision data from this lot was collected over 43 days total with 22 collection days. Two professional laboratory operators were used to collect this data.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable.   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability – Calibrators and Controls

Calibrators and controls are ready-to-use synthetic oral fluid solutions. The cutoff calibrator and controls are prepared by spiking known concentrations of amphetamine into synthetic oral fluid to obtain the cutoff level calibrator, and the positive and negative controls. The negative calibrator is drug free synthetic oral fluid.

Calibrators and controls are prepared from amphetamine from commercial primary standards purchased from a commercial vendor that uses NIST traceable weights and specific assays, such as HPLC and GC/MS, to confirm drug levels.

# Value Assignment - Calibrators and Controls

Calibrator and Control lots are value assigned during the manufacturing process in two steps. During the first stage, following bottling and labeling, new lots are assayed against at least one previously accepted, released and unexpired Calibrator and Control lot using RapidFRET reagents. Results are qualitatively evaluated for performance relative to the previously accepted lots. During the second stage, each new manufactured lot of Calibrator (Cutoff only) or Control (POS and NEG) is quantitatively confirmed by mass spectrometry (MS)-based method for target analyte concentration. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.

# Calibrators and Controls Stability Studies

Real-time stability studies were conducted on multiple lots of RapidFRET Oral Fluid Calibrators and RapidFRET Oral Fluid Controls. The stability protocols for open and closed vial were reviewed and found acceptable. The open vial and closed vial study results support the open vial stability claim of 30 days and closed vial stability claim of 12 months when stored at 2 to $8 \ : ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Calibrators and RapidFRET Oral Fluid Controls.

# Sample Shipment – Stability Study

A neat oral fluid pool was spiked with amphetamine to approximate $0 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $7 5 \%$ , $100 \%$ , $12 5 \%$ , $1 5 0 \%$ , $1 7 5 \%$ and $20 \%$ of the cutoff. Each spike was subsequently processed through a RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collection device to mimic actual collection process. Aliquots were stored and handled according to the collector insert. Samples were shipped multiple times at ambient temperature ( $4 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C }$ to $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and at low to high relative humidity conditions ( $7 \%$ to $100 \%$ R.H.) from California to North Carolina and back to California by FedEx Standard Overnight Express. Samples were evaluated at various time points quantitatively by MS based method

Amphetamine average recovery versus target concentration ranged from $9 2 . 8 \%$ to $1 0 2 . 0 \%$ across all spike levels during the course of 11 shipping days (4 cross country shipments plus carrier storage). Study data indicates that neat oral fluid samples containing amphetamine, transported in the RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector showed quantitative stability around the cutoff under conditions exceeding those outlined in product insert for expected use.

# Sample handling and Storage - Stability Studies

Conditions for oral fluid sample handling and storage were evaluated by preparing oral fluid samples with amphetamine from approximately $0 \%$ Cutoff $( 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ to $20 \%$ Cutoff $\mathrm { ( 1 0 0 ~ n g / m L ) }$ in approximately $2 5 \%$ increments. Samples were processed through RapidEASE oral fluid collection devices and stored under various conditions including room temperature, refrigerated $( 2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and frozen (-10 to $- 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ ). Samples were periodically sampled and analyzed. For each storage condition two sets of 9 levels each (18 samples total) were prepared and analyzed. Frozen storage study is ongoing. Average percent target recoveries ranged from $9 4 . 3 \%$ to $9 9 . 1 \%$ after storage at room temperature for 30 days, $9 3 . 4 \%$ to $9 8 . 5 \%$ after 56 days of refrigeration, and $9 1 . 5 \%$ to $1 0 0 . 9 \%$ freezing for 163 days. Based on the sample handling and storage study results, the sponsor has included the following statement in the labeling, “Room temperature storage for up to 7 days, refrigerated storage $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) up to 30 days and frozen storage (- $\cdot 1 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to $- 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) for up to 4 months.”

# Sample Recovery Study

Recovery studies were conducted by aliquoting neat, human oral fluid pool into glass tubes and spiking with amphetamine to achieve concentrations ranging from $0 \%$ of cutoff $( 0 \mathrm { n g / m L ) }$ to $20 \%$ of cutoff $( 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } ) }$ in replicates of five for each level in increments of $2 5 \%$ ( $1 2 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } ) }$ . Approximately half of the volume of each of these ‘PRE-RapidEASE’ samples was then removed and processed through a new RapidEASE Oral Fluid collector, mimicking as closely as possible the actual sample collection protocol, resulting in a ‘PRE-RapidEASE’ sample. The concentration of amphetamine in both the PRE-RapidEASE and the POST-RapidEASE samples for each spike level were measured by Mass Spectrometry. The results are summarized below:

To evaluate the effect of endogenous substances, pH, food, drinks, medications, and tobacco products that may be present in oral fluid samples, aliquots of a neat oral fluid pool were prepared and spiked with the potential interferent and amphetamine to achieve approximately $+ / -$ $50 \%$ of the cutoff. Samples were then processed through a RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector and analyzed. No negative or positive interference was observed in this study.
