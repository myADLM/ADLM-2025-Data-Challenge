# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See Indications for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use:

The Immunalysis Tramadol Urine Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay with a cutoff of $2 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The assay is intended for use in laboratories for the qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of Tramadol in human urine with automated clinical chemistry analyzers. This assay is calibrated against Tramadol. This in-vitro diagnostic device is for prescription use only.

The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of enabling laboratories to determine an appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as GC-MS or permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures. The test is not intended to differentiate between drugs of abuse and prescription use of Tramadol. There are no uniformly recognized drug levels for Tramadol in urine.

The Immunalysis Tramadol Urine Enzyme Immunoassay Kit provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid Chromatography / Mass Spectroscopy (LC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.

The Immunalysis Tramadol Urine Controls are used as control materials in the Immunalysis Tramadol Urine Enzyme Immunoassay.

The Immunalysis Tramadol Urine Calibrators are used as calibrators in the Immunalysis Tramadol Urine Enzyme Immunoassay for the qualitative and semi-quantitative determination of Tramadol in urine on automated clinical chemistry analyzers.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

For prescription use only.

CLSI EP5-A2: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods.

· CLSI EP7-A2: Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry

# L. Test Principle:

The assay is based on the competition of Tramadol labeled enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and the free Tramadol in the urine sample for the fixed amount of antibody binding sites. In the absence of the free Tramadol in the urine sample, the antibody (goat-polyclonal) binds the Tramadol enzyme conjugate and enzyme activity is inhibited. This creates a dose response relationship between Tramadol concentration in the urine and enzyme activity. The enzyme G6PDH activity is determined at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ spectrophotometrically by the conversion of NAD to NADH.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

All the performance studies were performed on the Beckman Coulter AU 400e chemistry analyzer.

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

A precision study was performed by one experienced operator following the CLSI (EP5‐A2) precision guidelines. Negative urine sample pools were spiked with Tramadol at 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, and $4 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , representing 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175 and $20 \%$ of the device cutoff $( 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ . Each level sample was tested in duplicate per run, two runs per day for twenty consecutive days (total $\mathrm { N } { = } 8 0 / \mathrm { l e v e l } _ { \mathit { i } }$ ) on the Beckman Coulter AU 400e chemistry analyzer. The results are summarized in the table below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability

Calibrators and controls are prepared from a standard solution of tramadol purchased from a commercial vendor. This standard solution is diluted with a BSA buffer to make the cutoff calibrator, control set of low and high controls, and calibrator set (of 5 level calibrators). The concentrations of the prepared solutions are confirmed by GC/MS or LC/MS/MS.

# Value Assignment – Calibrators and Controls

A commercially available standard solution of Tramadol is mixed with a commercially available BSA buffer to the desired calculated concentrations for the LOW control, HIGH control and Calibrators. The calibrators and controls are tested by GC/MS or LC/MS/MS. Values are assigned to the controls once the GC/MS or LC/MS/MS results are within acceptable ranges. The negative standard is prepared with the BSA buffer. The negative standard is compared to a reference negative standard to ensure that it is free of tramadol. Value is assigned when the test result is within the acceptable range. Acceptance criteria for value assignment were reviewed and deemed acceptable.

# Calibrators and Controls Stability Studies

Accelerated and real-time stability studies in the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes were conducted on multiple lots of Immunalysis Tramadol Urine Controls and Immunalysis Tramadol Urine Calibrators. The stability protocols and acceptance criteria for open and closed vial were reviewed and found acceptable. The open vial and closed vial study results support the open vial stability claim of six months and closed vial stability claim of twelve months when stored at 2 to $8 \ : ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for the Immunalysis Tramadol Urine Controls and Immunalysis Tramadol Urine Calibrators.

# Sample Storage - Stability Studies

A specimen storage study was performed using urine specimens at tramadol concentration of $1 4 7 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (below the cutoff) and $2 4 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ (above the cutoff) to establish specimen storage stability at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The urine specimen at tramadol concentration below the cutoff was negative in comparison to the $2 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ cutoff for day 0, week 1, 2, 3 and 4. The urine specimen at tramadol concentration above the cutoff was positive in comparison to the $2 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ cutoff for Day 0, Week 1, 2, 3 and 4. The stability study supported a one month urine specimen containing tramadol stability when stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

d. Detection limit:

Not applicable.

# e. Analytical specificity:

An analytical specificity study to evaluate interference from non-structurally and structurally related compounds was performed in the qualitative and semi-quantitative mode. The study design and results are described below. Results were the same for each mode (qualitative and semi-quantitative modes).

# Structurally Related Compounds

Compounds sharing structural or conformational similarity to tramadol were tested for cross-reactivity with the candidate device. The structurally related compounds that exhibited cross-reactivity with the candidate device in urine were titrated to determine the percent cross-reactivity. The concentration $\mathrm { ( n g / m L ) }$ of cross-reactant that gives a response equivalent to the cutoff, and the percent cross-reactivity are presented in the table below.

# Non-Structurally Related Compounds

Potential interference from non-structurally related drugs and metabolites was

evaluated in the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes, by spiking these compounds at high concentrations in pooled urine spiked with tramadol at $\pm 2 5 \%$ of the cutoff (150 and $2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ).

Compounds that showed interference was further evaluated by spiking it in pooled urine spiked with tramadol $a t \pm 5 0 \%$ of the cutoff (100 and $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } ) }$ ). Boric Acid at $1 \% \mathrm { ~ w ~ } / \mathrm { v }$ caused a false negative response for tramadol at $+ 2 5 \%$ and also at $+ 5 0 \%$ of the cutoff.

The following statement is listed under the Limitations section of the labeling, “Boric Acid at $1 \% w \%$ may cause false negative results. Boric Acid is not recommended as a preservative for urine.”

# pH and Specific Gravity

For potential interference from the pH of urine, device performance in the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes was tested using a range of urine $\mathsf { p H }$ values (3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0 and 11.0). All test samples were prepared in drug free urine containing Tramadol at $\pm 2 5 \%$ of the cutoff $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ tramadol concentrations). No positive or negative interference was observed at urine pH values ranging from 3.0 to 11.0 for each test mode.

For potential interference from the specific gravity of urine, device performance in the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes was tested using a range of urine specific gravity values (1.000, 1.002, 1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025 and 1.030). All test samples were prepared in drug free urine containing Tramadol at $\pm 2 5 \%$ of the cutoff ( $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ tramadol concentrations). No positive or negative interference was observed at urine specific gravity values ranging from 1.000 to 1.030 for each test mode.

# $f .$ Assay cut-off:

Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff concentration of $2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ tramadol is described in the precision section, M.1.a. above.
