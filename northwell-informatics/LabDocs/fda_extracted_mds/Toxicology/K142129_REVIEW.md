# L. Test Principle:

The RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Cocaine is an In Vitro Diagnostic competitive immunoassay used to detect cocaine in human oral fluid. This is a ready-to-use homogenous system that involves energy transfer between an acceptor fluorophore labeled to an antibody and a donor fluorophore labeled to drug. The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the donor fluorophore for a fixed number of binding sites on the antibody reagent. When acceptor and donor fluorophores are brought into close proximity through a binding event, energy transfer occurs. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal is measured at the wavelength of the acceptor fluorophore and is inversely proportional to the amount of drug in the sample. A Cutoff Calibrator is used to translate the sample measurement into a positive or negative result. Controls are used to establish and monitor precision and accuracy.

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable.

b. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability

The cutoff calibrator and controls are prepared by spiking known concentrations of Cocaine into synthetic oral fluid to obtain the cutoff level calibrator $( 2 0 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ , and the positive ( $3 0 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ and negative ( $\mathrm { 1 0 . 0 \ n g / m L ) }$ controls. The negative (0 $\mathrm { n g / m L ) }$ calibrator is drug free synthetic oral fluid. Calibrators and controls are prepared from primary standards (Cocaine at $1 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ in methanol) purchased from a commercial vendor that uses NIST traceable weights and specific assays, such as HPLC and GC/MS, to confirm drug levels.

# Value Assignment – Calibrators and Controls

Calibrator and Control lots are value assigned during the manufacturing process in two stages. During the first stage new lots are assayed against a minimum of one previously accepted, released and unexpired Calibrator and Control lot using RapidFRET reagents. During the second stage, each new manufactured accepted lot of Cutoff Calibrator, and of both Positive and Negative Controls is quantitatively confirmed by MS based method for target analyte concentration, and released only if the Sponsor’s acceptance criteria are met.

# Calibrators and Controls Stability Studies

Real-time stability studies were conducted on multiple lots of RapidFRET Oral Fluid Calibrators and RapidFRET Oral Fluid Controls. The stability protocols for open and closed vial were reviewed and found acceptable. The open vial and closed vial study results support the open vial stability claim of 30 days and closed vial stability claim of 12 months when stored at 2 to $8 \ : ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Calibrators and RapidFRET Oral Fluid Controls.

# Sample Shipment - Stability Studies

A neat oral fluid pool was spiked with Cocaine to $0 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $7 5 \%$ , $100 \%$ , $12 5 \%$ , $1 5 0 \%$ , $1 7 5 \%$ and $20 \%$ of cutoff corresponding to approximately 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and $4 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ concentration of Cocaine. Each spike was subsequently processed through a RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collection device to mimic the actual collection process as closely as possible. Aliquots were stored and handled according to the collection device insert. Two sets of samples were shipped from California to Maine multiple times by FedEx Standard Overnight Express over 8 days, (one set shipped at ambient temperature of $6 . 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $2 4 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and high R.H. of $5 1 . 5 \%$ to $100 \%$ with most readings above $9 5 \%$ and the second set shipped at ambient temperature of $0 \ { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $2 4 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and low R.H. of $2 . 0 \%$ to $4 8 . 5 \%$ with the majority of readings less than $1 5 \%$ ). Samples were assayed using the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Cocaine before and after each shipment. In addition, at various time points, aliquots were reserved and analyzed quantitatively by a mass spectrophotometry based method. The physical integrity of the RapidEASE sample tube was also evaluated following each shipment. The mass spectrometric quantitative results for high R.H. and low R.H. exposed samples were consistent with RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Cocaine results. Percent recoveries (at various time points compared to time before shipping) ranged from $9 8 . 6 \%$ to $1 0 4 . 5 \%$ and $9 8 . 7 \%$ to $1 0 4 . 7 \%$ for the samples exposed to high RH and low RH conditions, respectively.

# Sample Handling and Storage - Stability Studies

Conditions for oral fluid sample handling and storage were evaluated by preparing oral fluid samples with Cocaine from approximately $0 \%$ Cutoff $( 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ to $20 \%$ Cutoff $( 4 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L ) }$ in approximately $2 5 \%$ increments. Samples were processed through RapidEASE oral fluid collection devices and stored under various conditions including room temperature $2 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $2 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) for 22 days, refrigerated $( 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $7 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C }$ ) for 56 days, and frozen ( $- 1 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to $- 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) for 231 days (MS data). Samples were periodically sampled and analyzed by quantitative mass spectrometry. For each storage condition two sets of 9 levels each (18 total samples) were prepared and analyzed individually. Percent recoveries ranged from $9 0 . 6 \%$ to $9 5 . 8 \%$ after storage at room temperature for 22 days,

$9 2 . 8 \%$ to $9 7 . 5 \%$ after 56 days of refrigeration, and $9 2 . 2 \%$ to $9 7 . 7 \%$ freezing for 231 days. Based on the sample handling and storage study results, the sponsor has included the following statement in the labeling, “Room temperature storage for up to 7 days, refrigerated storage ( $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) up to 30 days and frozen storage ( $- 1 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to $- 2 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ ) for up to 6 months.”

# Sample Recovery Study

Recovery studies were conducted by aliquoting neat, human oral fluid pool into glass tubes and spiking with cocaine to achieve concentrations ranging from $0 \%$ of cutoff $( 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ to $20 \%$ of cutoff $( 4 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ in replicates of five for each level in increments of $2 5 \%$ $\mathrm { 5 . 0 \ n g / m L }$ ). Approximately half of the volume of each of these ‘PRE-RapidEASE’ samples was then removed and processed through a new RapidEASE Oral Fluid collector, mimicking as closely as possible the actual sample collection protocol, resulting in a ‘POST- RapidEASE’ sample. The concentration of cocaine in both the PRE- RapidEASE and the POST-RapidEASE samples for each spike level were measured by Mass Spectrometry. Recoveries ranged from $9 2 . 0 \%$ to $1 0 8 . 5 \%$ for single point measurements with average $( \mathrm { N } { = } 5 )$ recovery values ranging between $9 6 . 0 \%$ and $1 0 4 . 5 \%$ indicating complete recovery of analyte from the device following collection.

e. Analytical specificity:

An analytical specificity study of the assay to evaluate the interference from nonstructurally and structurally related compounds was performed. The study design and results are described below.

# Non-Structurally Related Compounds

Non-structurally related compounds were assayed using oral fluid pools spiked with cocaine $a t \pm 5 0 \%$ of the cutoff $( 1 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $3 0 \mathrm { n g / m L ) }$ . No interference was observed with the following non-structurally related compounds when tested up to a concentration of $3 0 { , } 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . (11- Hydroxy- $\cdot \Delta \cdot$ -9-THC, $\Delta \cdot$ -8-THC and ODesmethylvenlafaxine were tested up to a concentration of $3 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ; LSD was tested up to a concentration of $1 { , } 5 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ).

# Structurally Related Compounds

Compounds sharing structural or conformational similarity to cocaine were tested for cross-reactivity with the candidate device. Thirteen (13) structurally related compounds were determined to have crossreactivity at concentrations less than $3 0 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . No additional compounds exhibited any unexpected results in the presence of 10 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ or $3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ cocaine. The structurally related compounds that exhibited cross-reactivity with the candidate device in neat oral fluid pool with $0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ cocaine were titrated to determine the percent crossreactivity. The concentration $( \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ of cross-reactant that gives a

response equivalent to the cutoff, and the percent cross-reactivity are presented in the table below.

\*Hydroxymethoxymethcathinone (HMMC), a major metabolite of methylone, shares structural similarities to isoxsuprine and has been shown to cause interference. This was observed in the accuracy study, where the presence of Methylone and its metabolite (4-hydroxy-3- methoxymethcathinone) produced a positive result with no cocaine present.

Potential Interferents and Common Substances

An interference study was performed to evaluate potential interference from endogenous substances that may be present in the oral fluid samples. Aliquots of a neat oral fluid pool were spiked with the potential interferents (at concentrations shown in the table below) and with cocaine at $: \pm 5 0 \%$ of the Cutoff level ( $1 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $3 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ , processed through a RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector, and screened using the candidate device. Results showed that all samples spiked at $50 \%$ of cutoff tested negative, and all samples spiked at $1 5 0 \%$ of the cutoff tested positive.

To evaluate potential interference from additional food and dental products, volunteers used the indicated product according to common practice or product instructions, then provided an oral fluid sample using the RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector. Each oral fluid sample was then spiked with cocaine at approximately $50 \%$ ( $\mathrm { 1 0 n g / m L ) }$ or $1 5 0 \%$ $( 3 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ of cutoff. Samples were tested using the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Cocaine. All samples spiked at $50 \%$ tested negative, and all samples spiked at $1 5 0 \%$ screened positive.
