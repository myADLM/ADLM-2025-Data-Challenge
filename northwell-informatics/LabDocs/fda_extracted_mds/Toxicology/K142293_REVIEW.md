# L. Test Principle:

The RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Methamphetamine is an In Vitro Diagnostic competitive immunoassay used to detect methamphetamine in human oral fluid. This is a ready-to-use homogenous system that involves energy transfer between an acceptor fluorophore labeled to an antibody and a donor fluorophore labeled to drug. The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the donor fluorophore for a fixed number of binding sites on the antibody reagent. When acceptor and donor fluorophores are brought into close proximity through a binding event, energy transfer occurs. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal is measured at the wavelength of the acceptor fluorophore and is inversely proportional to the amount of drug in the sample. A Cutoff Calibrator is used to translate the sample measurement into a positive or negative result. Controls are used to establish and monitor precision and accuracy.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Three reagent lots of the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Methamphetamine were analyzed in 1-3 replicates per day on 1-4 plates per day for a minimum of 20 days. Negative oral fluid pools were spiked with methamphetamine derived from NIST weight traceable standards at $0 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $7 5 \%$ , $100 \%$ , $12 5 \%$ , $1 5 0 \%$ , $1 7 5 \%$ and $20 \%$ of the cutoff level corresponding to approximately 0, 12.5, 25, 37.5, 50, 62.5, 75, 87.5 and $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ methamphetamine. Each spike level was processed through a RapidEASE collector and confirmed by LC/MS/MS.

Results for all lots are summarized below. All samples at concentrations higher than the cutoff reported positive results, and all samples at concentrations lower than the cutoff reported negative results.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable.   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability

The cutoff calibrator and controls are prepared by spiking known concentrations of methamphetamine into synthetic oral fluid to obtain the cutoff level calibrator $( 5 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ , and the positive ( $7 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and negative ( $2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ) controls. The negative calibrator is drug free synthetic oral fluid. Calibrators and controls are prepared from $d \mathbf { \cdot }$ - methamphetamine $( 1 \mathrm { m g / m L } )$ in methanol commercial primary standards from a vendor that uses NIST traceable weights and specific assays, such as HPLC and GC/MS, to confirm drug levels.

# Value Assignment – Calibrators and Controls

Calibrator and Control lots are value assigned during the manufacturing process in two stages. During the first stage following bottling and labeling, new lots are assayed against previously accepted, released and unexpired Calibrator and Control lot(s) using RapidFRET reagents. Results are qualitatively evaluated for performance relative to the previously accepted lots. If any of the new material does not pass this stage of evaluation it is not passed to the second stage.

During the second stage, each new manufactured lot of Calibrator or Control is quantitatively confirmed by a Mass Spectroscopy based method for target analyte concentration. Quantitative results within the sponsor’s acceptance criteria are released. Quantitative results that do not meet acceptance criteria are not released pending investigation and analysis.

# Calibrators and Controls Stability Studies

Real-time stability studies were conducted on multiple lots of RapidFRET Oral Fluid Calibrators and RapidFRET Oral Fluid Controls. The stability protocols for open and closed vial were reviewed and found acceptable. The open vial and closed vial study results support the open vial stability claim of 30 days and closed vial stability claim of 12 months when stored at 2 to $8 \ : ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Calibrators and RapidFRET Oral Fluid Controls.

# Sample Shipment - Stability Studies

A neat oral fluid pool was spiked with methamphetamine at $0 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $7 5 \%$ , $100 \%$ , $12 5 \%$ , $1 5 0 \%$ , $1 7 5 \%$ , and $20 \%$ of the cutoff, corresponding to 0, 12.5, 25.0, 37.5, 50.0, 62.5, 75.0, 87.5, and $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . Each spike was subsequently processed through a RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collection device to mimic actual collection process. Aliquots were stored and handled according to the collector insert.

One set of samples (9 concentrations) was shipped under high relative humidity conditions and a second set was shipped under low relative humidity conditions. Both sets were tested by RapidFRET and confirmed by LC/MS/MS prior to shipment. The procedure was to ship using an overnight commercial carrier from California to Maryland and back again to

California and this was done twice over five days.

The “high humidity” set of samples was shipped under relative humidity conditions of 39- $9 8 \%$ with a large majority of readings greater than $8 6 . 5 \%$ relative humidity. The temperatures for this set ranged from $1 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

The “low humidity” set of samples was shipped under relative humidity conditions of 0- $45 \%$ with a large majority of readings less than $1 5 \%$ relative humidity. The temperatures for this set ranged from $1 0 . 5 – 2 6 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Samples were quantitatively assayed by MS at study start and at various time points over the duration of the study. Methamphetamine recovery vs. day 1 at various time points over the course of the study ranged from $9 8 . 0 - 1 0 8 . 6 \%$ at high relative humidity and from 90.1 – $1 0 7 . 5 \%$ at low relative humidity conditions. The physical integrity of the RapidEASE sample tube was also evaluated following each shipment and no signs of degradation were noted.

# Sample Storage and Stability:

Conditions for oral fluid sample handling and storage were evaluated by preparing oral fluid samples with Methamphetamine at concentrations of 0, 12.5, 25.0, 37.5, 50.0, 62.5, 75.0, 87.5, and $1 0 0 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $(0 \%$ , $2 5 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $7 5 \%$ , $100 \%$ , $12 5 \%$ , $1 5 0 \%$ , $1 7 5 \%$ , and $20 \%$ of the cutoff). Samples were processed through RapidEASE oral fluid collection devices and stored under various conditions including room temperature ( $2 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $2 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) for 29 days, refrigerated ( $3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $7 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C }$ ) for 86 days, and frozen (- $- 1 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to $- 2 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ ) for 231 days. Samples were periodically sampled and analyzed by quantitative mass spectrometry. For each storage condition two sets of 9 levels each (18 total samples) were prepared and analyzed individually. Individual percent recoveries ranged from $8 9 . 6 \%$ to $1 0 9 . 6 \%$ after 29 days storage at room temperature, $8 8 . 8 \%$ to $1 1 0 . 4 \%$ after 86 days under refrigeration, and $8 8 . 8 \%$ to $1 0 7 . 2 \%$ after frozen storage for 231 days.

The sponsor states the following in their regarding sample storage: Samples may be stored at ambient temperatures for up to 7 days including shipping. Short term storage of samples is recommended at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 30 days. Samples should be frozen at $\mathbf { \Omega } _ { - 1 0 } \mathbf { \Omega } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to ${ } _ { - 2 5 } \mathrm { \Omega } ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ for long-term storage up to 7 months. All samples should be stored protected from light in collection vial with cap securely tightened.

# Sample Recovery Study

Recovery studies were conducted by aliquoting neat, human oral fluid pool into glass tubes and spiking with methamphetamine to achieve concentrations ranging from $0 \%$ of cutoff (0 $\mathrm { n g / m L ) }$ to $20 \%$ of cutoff $( 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } ) }$ in 5 replicates for each level in $2 5 \%$ ( $1 2 . 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ increments. Approximately half of the volume of each of these ‘PRE-RapidEASE’ samples was then removed and processed through a new RapidEASE Oral Fluid collector, mimicking as close as possible actual collection protocol, resulting in a ‘POST-RapidEASE’ sample. Both the PRE-RapidEASE and POST-RapidEASE for each spike level was

confirmed for methamphetamine concentration by Mass Spectrometry. Results are summarized below:

# Potential Interferents and Common Substances

An interference study was performed to evaluate potential interference from endogenous substances that may be present in the oral fluid samples. Aliquots of a neat oral fluid pool were prepared and spiked with the potential interferent and with methamphetamine at concentrations of $0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and approximately 25 and $7 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $( \pm 5 0 \%$ of the cutoff). Samples were then processed through a RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector per Instructions and screened using the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Methamphetamine. All zero concentration samples and at $- 5 0 \%$ of cutoff gave negative results, and all samples at $+ 5 0 \%$ of cutoff gave positive results. The potential interferents and concentrations tested are listed below:

To evaluate potential interference from additional food and dental products, volunteers used the indicated product according to common practice or product instructions, then provided an oral fluid sample using the RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector. Each oral fluid sample was then spiked with methamphetamine to approximately 25 and $7 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $( \pm 5 0 \%$ of the cutoff) and analyzed. All samples at $- 5 0 \%$ of cutoff gave negative results, and all samples at $+ 5 0 \%$ of cutoff gave positive results. Results of the study are summarized below:

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Neat oral fluid was collected with the RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector from volunteers. A total of 92 samples were randomized and blinded to the instrument operator and assayed using the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Methamphetamine and LC/MS/MS reference method. Samples are categorized in the Method Comparison table according to the sum of d and l-methamphetamine concentration as measured by LC/MS/MS. The screening method is calibrated to d-methamphetamine. The results from the method comparison study are summarized in the table below:
