Dear Mr. Joe Shia:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls.

5. Predicate Devices: k132812 UCP Multi-Drug Test Key Cups

6. Intended Use

CR3 Keyless Split Sample Cup Nortriptyline–Buprenorphine is a rapid test for the qualitative detection of Nortriptyline (a major metabolite of Tricyclic Antidepressants) and Buprenorphine in human urine at a cutoff concentration of $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $1 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , respectively. The test is the first step in a two-step process. The second step is to send the sample for laboratory testing if preliminary positive results are obtained. The test is intended for over-the-counter and for prescription use.

The test may yield preliminary positive results even when prescription drugs including Tricyclic Antidepressants and Buprenorphine are ingested, at prescribed doses; it is not intended to distinguish between prescription use or abuse of these drugs. There are no uniformly recognized cutoff concentration levels for Nortriptyline and Buprenorphine in urine. The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.

For in vitro diagnostic use only.

# 7. Device Description

The CR3 Keyless Split Sample Cup Nortriptyline–Buprenorphine test uses immunochromatographic assays for nortriptyline and buprenorphine. The test is a lateral flow, one step system for the qualitative detection of nortriptyline and buprenorphine in human urine.

# 9. Test Principle

The CR3 Keyless Split Sample Cup Nortriptyline - Buprenorphine test is a rapid test for the qualitative detection of Nortriptyline and Buprenorphine in urine samples and contains lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays for nortriptyline and buprenorphine. Each assay uses a mouse monoclonal anti-drug antibody-dye conjugate, fixed drug-protein conjugates, and anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibodies coated on the test membranes. When the absorbent end of the test is immersed into a urine sample, the urine is absorbed into the device by capillary action and mixes with the antibody-dye conjugate, flowing across the pre-coated membrane. At analyte concentrations below the target cut-off, antibody-dye conjugates bind to the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device. This produces a colored test line that indicates a negative result. When analyte concentration is above the cut-off, analyte molecules bind to the antibody-dye conjugate, preventing the antibody-dye conjugate from binding to the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device. No colored band shows in the test region, indicating a potentially positive result. A band should form in the control region (C) of the device regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite in the sample.

10. Performance Characteristics

c. Stability

The CR3 Keyless Split Sample Cup Nortriptyline - Buprenorphine is stable at $4 { - } 3 0 ^ { \mathrm { { \mathrm { { o } } } } } \mathrm { C }$ for 18 months as determined by conducting accelerated and real-time stability testing.

Control materials are not provided with the device. The labeling provides information on how to obtain control materials.

# d. Cut-off

A total of 125 nortriptyline samples and 125 buprenorphine samples equally distributed at concentrations of - $. 5 0 \%$ , $- 2 5 \%$ , at the cut-off, $+ 2 5 \%$ , $+ 5 0 \%$ of their respective cut-offs were labeled by a person who prepared them and would not participate in the sample testing. These samples were tested using three different lots by three different operators. Results were all positive at $+ 2 5 \%$ and $+ 5 0 \%$ cut-off and all negative at $- 2 5 \%$ and $- 5 0 \%$ cut-off for both nortriptyline and buprenorphine. The following cut-off values for the test devices have been verified.

e. Interference

Potential interfering substances found in human urine of physiological or pathological conditions were added to drug-free urine and to urine containing target drugs (nortriptyline or buprenorphine) at $2 5 \%$ below and $2 5 \%$ above the cut-off. These urine samples were tested using three batches of the CR3Keyless Split Sample Cup Nortriptyline - Buprenorphine by three different operators.

To test the specificity, drug metabolites and other components that are likely to be present in urine samples were tested. The target drug (Nortriptyline or Buprenorphine), its drug metabolites and the related compounds were studied. These samples were tested using three batches of the CR3Keyless Split Sample Cup Nortriptyline–Buprenorphine by three different operators. The drug metabolites and other components were tested at different concentrations. The obtained lowest detectable concentration was used to calculate the cross-reactivity.

# g. Effect of Specific Gravity and pH

Twelve urine samples of normal, high, and low specific gravity ranges (1.000 to 1.035) were collected and spiked with either Nortriptyline or Buprenorphine at $2 5 \%$ below and $2 5 \%$ above the corresponding cut-off level. These samples were tested using three batches of the CR3Keyless Split Sample Cup Nortriptyline– Buprenorphine by three different operators.

The $\mathsf { p H }$ of an aliquot negative urine pool was adjusted to pH ranges of 4.00 to 9.00 in $1 \mu \mathrm { H }$ unit increments and spiked with Nortriptyline or Buprenorphine at $2 5 \%$ below and $2 5 \%$ above the corresponding cut-off levels. These samples were tested using three batches of the CR3Keyless Split Sample Cup Nortriptyline– Buprenorphine by three different operators.

The device performance was found not affected by varying specific gravity and $\mathsf { p H }$ .

# 2. Comparison Studies

The method comparison for the $\mathrm { C R } ^ { 3 }$ Keyless Split Sample Cup Nortriptyline– Buprenorphine was performed in-house with three laboratory assistants. Operators ran 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered clinical samples. The samples were masked and randomized. The obtained test results are compared to GC/MS results. The results are presented in the table below:

A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 260 lay persons, of which, 20 tested for drug-free samples, 120 for nortriptyline samples, 120 for buprenorphine samples. They had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 21 to ${ > } 5 0$ years. Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations; $- 1 0 0 \%$ , $+ / - 7 5 \%$ , $+ / - 5 0 \%$ , $+ / - 2 5 \%$ of the cut-off by spiking drug(s) into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by GC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers, blind-labeled and randomized. Each participant was provided with the package insert, 1 blind labeled sample and a device. The results are summarized below:

Lay-users were also given surveys on the ease of understanding the package insert instructions. All lay users indicated that the device instructions can be easily followed A Flesch-Kincaid reading analysis was performed on the package insert and the score revealed a reading grade level of less than 7.
