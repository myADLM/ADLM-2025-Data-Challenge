Dear Reba Daoust:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

Date Summary Prepared: 06/26/2015

# Indications for Use:

The LeadCare® Plus™ Blood Lead Testing System is intended for the quantitative measurement of lead in a whole blood sample. The LeadCare Plus Blood Lead Testing System is intended for in vitro (external) use only. The test kit components are for use with both the LeadCare Plus and LeadCare Ultra® Blood Lead Testing Systems.

This test system is for prescription use only. This system is not intended for point of care use.

# Device Description and Test Principle:

The LeadCare Plus Blood Lead Testing System is a new instrument to the LeadCare line of instruments. The predicate, LeadCare Ultra, is a 6-channel analyzer which has the same intended use as the LeadCare Plus. The LeadCare Plus instrument is a one-channel version of this system. The LeadCare Plus Analyzer is used in conjunction with the same test kit components, including: sensors, control materials, and single-use packaged reagent tubes as utilized with the predicate device, LeadCare Ultra. The single-channel LeadCare Plus analyzer is an in vitro diagnostic device that relies on electrochemistry (Anodic Stripping Voltammetry or ASV).

The analyzer is a low voltage potentiostat that runs on AC power or batteries and has dimensions of $9 ^ { \prime \prime } { \mathrm { x } } 6 . 5 ^ { \prime \prime } { \mathrm { x } } 3 . 5 ^ { \prime \prime }$ . It is equipped with a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) Screen, Sensor Connector and Calibration Button reader. The Screen displays instructions for the blood lead assay, result, lot code and error messages. The Calibration Button reader allows for the download of all calibration information, analytical test parameters, and lot code information for any given Sensor lot.

For measurement of lead, the whole blood sample is pipetted to a packaged reagent tube. Upon mixing, the red blood cells are ruptured and the lead is released from the proteins and becomes labile and available for electrochemical detection. After the sample mixture is applied to the sensor, the analyzer applies an electrical potential that causes the lead to reduce (collect) on the sensor. After three minutes, the analyzer applies potentials that cause the lead to oxidize back into solution. The current produced is measured and the amount of lead in the sample is calculated. The analytical result is displayed on the screen in micrograms per deciliter $\mathrm { ( \mu g / d L ) }$ .

# Summary of Non-Clinical and Clinical Performance Testing as Basis for Substantial Equivalence:

# A. Non-Clinical Results

# Precision

The Precision Study was performed using bovine blood standards at lead concentrations of 3.1, 5.1, 11.7, 24.7 and $4 5 . 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ . An additional human blood sample at lead concentration of $5 9 . 1 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ was also included to challenge the high end of the range. Eighty (80) data points were collected per concentration level over a 20 day period using two Sensor/Reagent Lot Pairs following CLSI EP05-A2 guidelines. Samples were prepped two times per day. The LeadCare Plus precision passed the pre-defined acceptance criteria.

# Linearity

Linearity assessments were performed on two Sensor/Reagent Lot Pairs using nine donor blood samples, spiked with lead to concentrations of $0 { - } 2 ~ { \mu } \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ , $2 { - } 5 ~ { \mu } \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ , ${ 5 { \mathrm { - } } 1 0 \ \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L } }$ , $1 5 { - } 2 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ , $2 5 { - } 3 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ , $3 5 { - } 4 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ , $4 5 { - } 5 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ , 55-65, $6 5 { \mathrm { - } } 7 0 { \mu } \mathrm { g / d L }$ . One whole blood, unadulterated in $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA vacutainers, was also included.

Linearity was evaluated by performing polynomial regressions and determining whether higher order coefficients were statistically significant as per CLSI EP06-A Section 5.32.

The Linear Regression results for each of the two Sensor/Reagent Lot Pairs are as follows:

1312B/021214U Y = 1.11x – 1.49 $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 8$

$$
\begin{array} { l } { { \Upsilon = 1 . 0 8 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 8 0 3 } } \\ { { \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 7 } } \end{array}
$$

# Limit of Blank, Limit of Detection & Limit of Quantification

The Limits of Blank, Detection and Quantification were established using the Total Error Analysis Method and by following the CLSI EP17-A2 guidelines.

The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by running 60 replicates of near blank bovine blood samples, over 5 days. Samples were analyzed using two Sensor/Reagent Lot Pairs.

The average LoB was calculated to be $0 . 9 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$

The Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification (LoQ) were determined by running 60 replicates of 10 different whole blood samples, collected in $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA vacutainers. The replicates were run, using two Sensor/Reagent Lot Pairs on LeadCare Plus analyzers over five days.

The average LoD was calculated to be $1 . 2 \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ .

The Limit of Quantification LoQ was calculated using the Total Error equation:

Total Error $\mathrm { L o Q = }$ absolute (Bias) + (2 x SD)

The average LoQ was calculated to be $1 . 6 \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ .

The Total Error at the LoQ was $1 8 \%$ .

Obtained LoB, LoD, and LoQ values for the LeadCare Plus differ slightly from those obtained for the LeadCare Ultra (See k123563). For product family consistency between LeadCare Plus and LeadCare Ultra, the claimed values for LoB, LoD and LoQ of the LeadCare Plus are provided in the table below and are identical to the values obtained for the LeadCare Ultra:

# B. Clinical Results

# Method Comparison

The Method Comparison Study was conducted at one site with two Sensor/Reagent Lot Pairs; two labs; two users and two stations of six LeadCare Plus analyzers. To determine accuracy, based on CLSI EP09-A3, clinical samples were run on the LeadCare Plus systems and the results were compared to the predicate method, LeadCare Ultra and to the reference method, Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (GFAAS).

Whole blood samples collected in $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 }$ EDTA Vacutainers, were run singly on the LeadCare Plus and predicate device, LeadCare Ultra; and in duplicate on the reference method, GFAAS. Two hundred eighty four (284) results were generated and 169 were within range of $1 . 9 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 6 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ .

# Matrix Comparison

Matrix Comparisons were made for the Micro-capillary tubes with $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ . The bloods had lead concentrations that spanned the range 1.9 to $6 3 . 1 \ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ , based on GFAAS. Twenty three results were obtained from native patient samples. Twenty seven results were obtained with contrived blood samples, spiked with lead.

# Conclusions:

The LeadCare Plus System is substantially equivalent to the previously cleared predicate product. The proposed device raises no new issues of safety and effectiveness. The non-clinical and clinical testing summarized demonstrates that the LeadCare Plus met all the specifications and is suitable for its intended use.
