# L. Test Principle:

The LeadCare $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ PlusTM Blood Lead Testing System is an in vitro diagnostic device that relies on electrochemistry (Anodic Stripping Voltammetry or ASV) with a sensor to detect lead in whole blood. When a sample of whole blood is mixed with Treatment Reagent (a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid), the red blood cells are lysed and the lead becomes available for electrochemical detection. When a test is run, the analyzer applies an electrical potential that causes the lead to collect on the Sensor. The analyzer measures the amount of lead on the Sensor and displays the result in micrograms per deciliter.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The LeadCare $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ PlusTM precision was demonstrated using bovine blood standards at lead concentrations of 3.1, 5.1, 11.7, 24.7 and $4 5 . 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ . An additional human blood sample at a lead concentration of $5 9 . 1 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ was also included to challenge the high end of the range. Eighty (80) data points were collected per concentration level over a 20 day period using two Sensor/Reagent Lot Pairs. The combined data set is shown:

$\mathrm { W R } =$ within run

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity assessments were performed on two Sensor/Reagent Lot Pairs using nine human donor blood samples, spiked with lead to concentrations of $0 { - } 2 ~ { \mu } \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ , 2-5 $\mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ , ${ \sf 5 - 1 0 } ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ , $1 5 { - } 2 5 \ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ , $2 5 { \cdot } 3 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ , $3 5 { \cdot } 4 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ , $4 5 { - } 5 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ , 55-65, 65- $7 0 ~ \mu \varrho / \mathrm { d L }$ . One whole blood sample, unadulterated in $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ vacutainers, was also included.

The Linear Regression results for each of the two Sensor/Reagent Lot Pairs are as follows:

$$
\begin{array} { l } { \frac { \operatorname { L o t } \operatorname { P a i r } \# 1 } { \operatorname { Y } = 1 . 1 1 \mathrm { x } - 1 . 4 9 } } \\ { \operatorname { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 8 } \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array} { l } { \frac { \operatorname { L o t } \operatorname { P a i r } \# 2 } { \operatorname { Y } = 1 . 0 8 \mathrm { { x } } - 0 . 8 0 3 } } \\ { \mathrm { { R } } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 7 } \end{array}
$$

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed reportable range of 1.9 – 65 $\mu \mathrm { g / d L }$

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability: The LeadCare $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ PlusTM system is traceable to the NIST Standard Reference Material 955c analyzed on Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (GFAAS).

Test Kit Stability: Protocols and acceptance criteria were previously reviewed and found to be acceptable (k123563) for the test kit. The sponsor’s stability claims are for 18 months when stored at $5 9 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } F }$ to $8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 2 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . The labeling instructs the user not to freeze or refrigerate the reagent. The sensors should be kept sealed until the sample is prepared and the treatment reagent should be used immediately after opening the tube.

Control Solutions: Two levels of Quality Controls material are provided with the test kit, Level 1 and Level 2. Theses control solutions were previously cleared k063398. The labeling instructs the user to store the control solutions at: $1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 2 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ( $5 9 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ - $8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ ) and not to refrigerate.

Sample stability study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to acceptable to support the claims in the labeling that samples collected in microcapillary K2EDTA tubes can be stored for up to 72 hours (3 days) from collection at $3 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } - 7 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $( 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ prior to being mixed with treatment reagent.

# d. Detection limit:

The Limits of Blank, Detection and Quantification were established using the Total Error Analysis Method and by following the CLSI EP17-A2 guidelines.

The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by running 60 replicates of near blank bovine blood samples, over 5 days. Samples were analyzed using two Sensor/Reagent Lot Pairs. The average LoB was calculated to be $0 . 9 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ .

The Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification (LoQ) were determined by running 60 replicates of 10 different whole blood samples, collected in $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ vacutainers. The replicates were run, using two Sensor/Reagent Lot Pairs on

LeadCare Plus analyzers over five days. The average LoD was calculated to be 1.2 $\mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ .

The Limit of Quantification LoQ was calculated using the Total Error equation:

Total Error $\mathrm { L o Q = }$ absolute $( \mathrm { B i a s } ) + ( 2 \mathrm { x } \mathrm { S D } )$

The average LoQ was calculated to be $1 . 6 \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$

The Total Error at the LoQ was $1 8 \%$ .

Obtained LoB, LoD, and LoQ values for the LeadCare $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ PlusTM differ slightly from those obtained for the predicate, LeadCare Ultra $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ (See k123563). For product family consistency between LeadCare $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ PlusTM and LeadCare Ultra $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ , the claimed values for LoB, LoD and LoQ of the LeadCare $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ PlusTM are provided in the table below and are identical to the values obtained for the LeadCare Ultra $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ :

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LeadCare® PlusTM</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoB</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.5 μg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.9 μg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>LoQ</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.9 μg/dL</td></tr></table>

e. Analytical specificity:

The assay reagents and controls are unchanged from the predicate, therefore please refer to k123563 where analytical specificity was established.

f. Assay cut-off:

Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison study was conducted at one site with two Sensor/Reagent Lot Pairs, two labs, two users and two stations of six LeadCare Plus analyzers. To assess system accuracy 169 whole blood samples collected in $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ Vacutainers with lead concentrations within the claimed analytical range of $1 . 9 - 6 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ were run on the LeadCare $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ PlusTM system and the results were compared to the reference method, Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (GFAAS). The LeadCare $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ PlusTM results from each sample were compared to the average of two GFAAS results. The linear regression results are as follows:

$$
\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 2 9 \mathrm { x } . 0 . 9 8 , \mathbf { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 4
$$

b. Matrix comparison:

A total of 50 micro-capillary tubes with $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { E D T A }$ fingerstick samples were spiked with lead to achieve concentrations of $1 . 9 { - } 6 3 . 1 \ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ lead as measured by GFAAS. Samples tested included unaltered native patient samples and spiked samples. These samples were analyzed on the LeadCare $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ PlusTM system and compared to values obtained from GFAAS. The linear regression results are as follows:

$$
\operatorname { y } \mathrm { = } 1 . 0 1 8 \mathrm { X } - 0 . 0 2 3 ; \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 8 3
$$

The assay reagents and controls are unchanged from the predicate, therefore please refer to k123563 for matrix comparison information for EDTA Vacutainer and Heparin Vacutainer samples.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable.   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable.   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The current labeling includes the following:

In 2012, based on the increased body of evidence demonstrating there is no safe level of lead in the blood, experts established a new reference value to identify children who have elevated blood lead levels (BLL). According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website, this level is based on the U.S. population of children ages 1-5 years who are in the top $2 . 5 \%$ of children when tested for lead in their blood (when compared to children who are exposed to more lead than most children). Currently this reference value is $5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } } / { \mathrm { d L } }$ , a change from the previously utilized “level of concern” set at $1 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / d L } }$ .\*
