Dear Mr. Joseph Ginete:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the

Device Name   
Immunalysis Amphetamine Urine Enzyme Immunoassay, Immunalysis Amphetamine Urine Calibrators, Immunalysis Amphetamine   
Urine Control Set Indications for Use (Describe)   
The Immunalysis Amphetamine Urine Enzyme Immunoassay Kit is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay with dual cutoffs of $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ and $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . The assay is intended for use in laboratories for the qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of Amphetamine in human urine with automated clinical chemistry analyzers. This assay is calibrated against Amphetamine. This in-vitro device is for prescription use only.

The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of enabling laboratories to determine an appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as GC-MS or permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.

The Immunalysis Amphetamine Urine Enzyme Immunoassay Kit provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.

Immunalysis Amphetamine Urine Controls: The Immunalysis Amphetamine Urine Controls are used as control materials in Immunalysis Amphetamine Urine Enzyme Immunoassay.

Immunalysis Amphetamine Urine Calibrators: The Immunalysis Amphetamine Urine Calibrators are used as calibrators in the Immunalysis Amphetamine Urine Enzyme Immunoassay. for the qualitative and semi-quantitative determination of Amphetamine in urine on automated clinical chemistry analyzers.

1. Precision/Cutoff Characterization – Study was performed for 20 days, 2 runs per day in duplicate $( \mathrm { N } { = } 8 0 )$ ) on concentration of $\pm 2 5 \%$ , $\pm 5 0 \%$ , $\pm 7 5 \%$ , and $\pm 1 0 0 \%$ of the cutoff. The study verified that the cutoff serves as a boundary between a negative and positive interpretation of a qualitative result. In addition, it also verified that product performance relative to the ability of the device to produce the same value during repeated measurements.

3. Interference – Structurally non-similar compounds, endogenous compounds, the effect of $\mathrm { p H }$ and the effect of specific gravity was evaluated by spiking the potential interferent into drug free urine containing the target analyte at $\pm 2 5 \%$ of the cutoff. All potential interferents analyzed verified that assay performance is unaffected by externally ingested compounds or an internally existing physiological condition. The instrument used for this test was a Beckman Coulter AU 400e.

6. Stability –

a.A closed accelerated stability study was performed on reagents, calibrators and controls at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to establish the initial expiration dating. The stability study supported an initial expiration date of 1 year for reagents. This stability study supported an initial expiration date of 12 months for calibrators and controls. The instrument used for this test was a Beckman Coulter AU 400e. Real time stability studies are ongoing.

b.An open/on-board stability study was performed on reagents to establish expiration dating when reagents are opened and stored on board the instrument at $2 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to $8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . The stability study supported an initial open vial expiration date of 28 days. The instrument used for this test was Beckman Coulter AU 400e.

7. Calibrator and Control Traceability – all components of the calibrator and controls have been traced to a commercially available standard solution

8. Calibrator and Control Stability – An open accelerated stability study was performed at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to establish the initial open vial expiration dating. The stability study supported an initial open vial expiration date of 6 months. The instrument used for this test was a Beckman Coulter AU 400e. All calibrator levels (500, 1,000, 1,500, and $2 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ ) and control levels (375, 625, 750, 1,250ng/mL) were within specifications for Day 0, 8, 16, 32, and 40. This accelerated stability study was performed to establish initial expiration dating. Real time stability studies are ongoing.

9. Calibrator and Control Value Assignment – calibrators and controls are manufactured and are tested by mass spectrometry. If any of the analytes are out of the acceptable range, then the calibrator and control is adjusted and re-tested. Values are assigned to the calibrator and controls once the mass spectrometry results are within the acceptable ranges.

# H. Conclusion

The information provided in this pre-market notification demonstrates that the Immunalysis Amphetamine Urine Enzyme Immunoassay is substantially equivalent to the legally marketed predicate device for its general intended use.
