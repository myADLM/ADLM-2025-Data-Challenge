Dear Mr. Joseph Ginete:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the

Device Name   
Immunalysis Opiates Urine Enzyme Immunoassay, Immunalysis Opiates Urine Calibrators 300, Immunalysis Multi-Drug Controls,   
and Immunalysis Opiates Urine Calibrators 2000

Indications for Use (Describe) Immunalysis Opiates Urine Enzyme Immunoassay

The Immunalysis Opiates Urine Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay with a dual cutoff of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ and $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The assay is intended for use in laboratories for the qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of opiates in human urine with automated clinical chemistry analyzers. This assay is calibrated against Morphine. This in-vitro diagnostic device is for prescription use only.

The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of enabling laboratories to determine an appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as GC-MS or permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.

The Immunalysis Opiates Urine Enzyme Immunoassay Kit provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/ Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.

Immunalysis Opiates Urine Calibrators 300

The Immunalysis Opiates Urine Calibrators 300 are intended for in vitro diagnostic use for the calibration of assays for the analytes currently listed in the package insert: Morphine. The Immunalysis Opiates Urine Calibrators 300 consists of 4 levels, with Level 1 containing $1 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , Level 2 containing $3 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , Level 3 containing $5 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and Level 4 containing $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ of morphine. The calibrators are designed for prescription use with homogenous enzyme immunoassays on automated clinical chemistry analyzers.

Immunalysis Multi-Drug Controls

H. The following laboratory performance studies were performed to determine substantial equivalence of the Immunalysis Opiates Urine Enzyme Immunoassay to the predicate:

1. Precision/Cutoff Characterization – Study was performed for 20 days, 2 runs per day in duplicate $( \mathrm { N } { = } 8 0 )$ ) on concentration of $\pm 2 5 \% , \pm 5 0 \% , \pm 7 5 \% .$ , and $\pm 1 0 0 \%$ of the cutoff. The study verified that the cutoff serves as a boundary between a negative and positive interpretation of a qualitative result. In addition, it also verified the product performance relative to the ability of the device to produce the same value during repeated measurements. The instruments used for this was a Beckman Coulter AU 400e.

2. Specificity and Cross-Reactivity – Structurally similar compounds were spiked into drug free urine at levels that will yield a result that is equivalent to the cutoffs. The study verified assay performance relative to the ability of the device to exclusively determine certain drugs. The instrument used for this test was a Beckman Coulter AU 400e.

3. Interference – Structurally non-similar compounds, endogenous compounds, the effect of $\mathrm { p H }$ and the effect of specific gravity was evaluated by spiking the potential interferents into drug free urine containing morphine at $\pm 2 5 \%$ of the cutoffs. Boric Acid and Riboflavin caused a false negative response at the concentrations tested. All other potential interferents analyzed verified that assay performance is unaffected by externally ingested compounds or an internally existing physiological condition. The instrument used for this test was a Beckman Coulter AU 400e.

d. Multi-Drug Control Value Assignment – Controls are manufactured and are tested by mass spectrometry. If any of the analytes are not of the acceptable range, then the controls are adjusted and re-tested. Values are assigned to the controls once the mass spectrometry results are within the acceptable ranges.

9. Calibrator Analytical Performance – Immunalysis Opiates Urine Calibrators 2000 a. Opiates Urine Calibrators Traceability – all components of the calibrators have been traced to a commercially available standard solution.

b. Opiates Urine Calibrators Closed Vial Stability – An accelerated stability study was performed at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to establish the initial expiration dating. The stability study supported an initial expiration date of 12 months. The instrument used for this test was an Agilent 1200 Series Liquid Chromatograph coupled to Agilent 6410 Tandem Mass Spectrometer. All calibrator levels (1, 2, 3, and 4) for Morphine were within specifications for Day 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 40. This accelerated stability study was performed to establish initial expiration dating. Real time stability studies are ongoing.

c. Opiates Urine Calibrators Open Vial Stability – A stability study was performed at $5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to establish the initial expiration dating. The stability study supported an initial expiration date of 60 days. The instrument used for this test was an Agilent 1200 Series Liquid Chromatograph coupled to Agilent 6410 Tandem Mass Spectrometer. All calibrator levels (1, 2, 3, and 4) for Morphine were within specifications for Day 0, 19, 26, 33, 41, and 60. This stability study was performed to establish initial expiration dating.

d. Opiates Urine Calibrators Value Assignment - Calibrators are manufactured and are tested by mass spectrometry. If any of the analytes are not of the acceptable range, then the calibrators is adjusted and retested. Values are assigned to the calibrators once the mass spectrometry results are within the acceptable ranges.

# I. Conclusion

The information provided in this pre-market notification demonstrates that the Immunalysis Opiates Urine Enzyme Immunoassay is substantially equivalent to the legally marketed predicate device for its general intended use.
