Dear Mr. Joe Shia:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

5. Predicate Devices: K122904 Wondfo Multi-Drug Urine Test Cup

6. Intended Use:

CR3 Keyless Split Sample Cup Secobarbital-Methadone is a rapid test for the qualitative detection of Secobarbital and Methadone in human urine at a cutoff concentration of $3 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for each of the drugs.

The test may yield preliminary positive results when prescription drugs Secobarbital and Methadone are ingested, even at or above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly recognized drug levels for Secobarbital and Methadone in urine. The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.

For in vitro diagnostic use only.

The CR3 Keyless Split Sample Cup Secobarbital – Methadone test uses immunochromatographic assays for secobarbital and methadone. The test is a lateral flow system for the qualitative detection of secobarbital and methadone in human urine. The test is the first step in a two-step process. The second step is to send the sample for laboratory testing if preliminary positive results are obtained.

# 9. Test Principle

The CR3 Keyless Split Sample Cup Secobarbital – Methadone test is a rapid test for the qualitative detection of Secobarbital and Methadone in urine samples and contains lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays for secobarbital and methadone. Each assay uses a mouse monoclonal anti-drug antibody-dye conjugate, fixed drug-protein conjugates, and anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibodies coated on the test membranes. When the absorbent end of the test is immersed into a urine sample, the urine is absorbed into the device by capillary action and mixes with the antibody-dye conjugate, flowing across the pre-coated membrane. At analyte concentrations below the target cut-off, antibody-dye conjugates bind to the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device. This produces a colored test line that indicates a negative result. When analyte concentration is above the cut-off, analyte molecules bind to the antibody-dye conjugate, preventing the antibody-dye conjugate from binding to the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device. No colored band shows in the test region, indicating a potentially positive result. A band should form in the control region (C) of the device regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite in the sample.

# f. Specificity

To test the specificity, drug metabolites and other components that are likely to be present in urine samples were tested. The target drug (Secobarbital or Methadone), its drug metabolites and the related compounds were studied. These samples were tested using three batches of the CR3Keyless Split Sample Cup Secobarbital –Methadone by three different operators. The drug metabolites and other components were tested at different concentrations. The obtained lowest detectable concentration was used to calculate the cross-reactivity. Results are shown in the following tables.

# g. Effect of Specific Gravity and Urine pH

Twelve urine samples of normal, high, and low specific gravity ranges (1.000 to 1.035) were collected and spiked with either Secobarbital or Methadone at $2 5 \%$ below and $2 5 \%$ above the corresponding cut-off level. These samples were tested using three batches of the CR3 Keyless Split Sample Cup Secobarbital-Methadone by three different operators.

The pH of an aliquot negative urine pool was adjusted to $\mathsf { p H }$ ranges of 4.00 to 9.00 in $1 \ p \mathrm { H }$ unit increments and spiked with Secobarbital or Methadone at $2 5 \%$ below and $2 5 \%$ above the

corresponding cut-off levels. These samples were tested using three batches of the CR3 Keyless Split Sample Cup Secobarbital-Methadone by three different operators.

The device performance was found not affected by varying specific gravity and pH.

# 2. Comparison Studies

The method comparison for the $\mathrm { C R } ^ { 3 }$ Keyless Split Sample Cup Secobarbital-Methadone was performed in-house with three laboratory assistants. Operators ran 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered clinical samples. The samples were masked and randomized. The obtained test results were compared to GC/MS results.

Lay-user study

A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 260 lay persons, of which, 20 tested for drug-free samples, 120 for secobarbital samples, 120 for methadone samples. They had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 21 to ${ > } 5 0$ years. Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations; $- 1 0 0 \%$ , $+ / - 7 5 \%$ , $+ / - 5 0 \%$ , $+ / - 2 5 \%$ of the cut-off by spiking drugs into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by GC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers, blind-labeled and randomized. Each participant was provided with the package insert, 1 blind labeled sample and a device. The results are summarized below:

Lay-users were also given surveys on the ease of understanding the package insert instructions. All lay users indicated that the device instructions can be easily followed A Flesch-Kincaid reading analysis was performed on the package insert and the score revealed a reading grade level of less than 7.

3. Clinical Studies Not applicable.

11. Conclusion

Based on the test principle and performance characteristics of the device, it’s concluded that $\mathrm { C R } ^ { 3 }$ Keyless Split Sample Cup Secobarbital – Methadone is substantially equivalent to the predicate.
