Dear Mr. Joe Shia:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

6. Intended Use / Indications for Use Healgen Secobarbital Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative determination of Secobarbital in human urine at a Cut-Off concentration of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The test is available in a Strip format, a Cassette format, a Dip Card format and a Cup format.

The test may yield preliminary positive results even when the prescription drug Secobarbital is ingested, at prescribed doses; it is not intended to distinguish between prescription use or abuse of this drug. There is no uniformly recognized cutoff concentration level for Secobarbital in urine. The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.

For in vitro diagnostic use only. It is intended for prescription and for over-the-counter use.

Healgen Buprenorphine Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative determination of Buprenorphine in human urine at a Cut-Off concentration of $1 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The test is available in a Strip format, a Cassette format, a Dip Card format and a Cup format.

9. Test Principle

Healgen Secobarbital Test, Healgen Buprenorphine Test and Healgen Methadone Test are rapid tests for the qualitative detection of Secobarbital, Buprenorphine and Methadone in urine samples. Each assay test is a lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay. During testing, a urine specimen migrates upward by capillary action. If target drugs are present in the urine specimen below its cut-off concentration, it will not saturate the binding sites of its specific antibody (monoclonal mouse antibody) coated on the particles. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate and a visible colored line will show up in the test line region. The colored line will not form in the test line region if the target drug level exceeds its cut-off concentration because it will saturate all the binding sites of the antibody coated on the particles. A band should form in the control region of the devices regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite in the sample to indicate that the test has been performed properly.

# 10. Performance Characteristics

1. Analytical Performance

a. Precision

Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of - $- 1 0 0 \%$ cut-off, $- 7 5 \%$ cut-off, $- 5 0 \%$ cut-off, $- 2 5 \%$ cut-off, at the cut-off, $+ 2 5 \%$ cut-off, $+ 5 0 \%$ cut-off, $+ 7 5 \%$ cut-off and $+ 1 0 0 \%$ cut-off. These samples were prepared by spiking drug in negative samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by GC/MS. All sample aliquots were blind labeled and randomized by the person who prepared samples and did not take part in the sample testing. For each concentration, tests were performed two runs per day for 25 days by three different operators for each format of devices. Different set of operators tested each format. The results obtained are summarized in the following tables:

b. Linearity Not applicable.

c. Stability The devices are stable at $4 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 24 months based on the accelerated stability study at $4 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ and real time stability determination at both $4 ~ { ^ \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $3 0 \%$ .

Control materials are not provided with the device. The labeling provides information on how to obtain control materials.

d. Cut-off

A total of 150 samples equally distributed at concentrations of $- 5 0 \%$ cut-off; $- 2 5 \%$ cut-off; cut-off; $+ 2 5 \%$ cut-off; $+ 5 0 \%$ cut-off were tested using three different lots of each device by three different operators. Results were all positive at and above $+ 2 5 \%$ cut-off and all negative at and below $- 2 5 \%$ cut-off for Secobarbital, Buprenorphine and Methadone. The following cut-off values for the test devices have been verified.

e. Interference

Potential interfering substances found in human urine of physiological or pathological conditions were added to drug-free urine and target drugs urine with concentration at $2 5 \%$ below and $2 5 \%$ above cut-off levels. These urine samples were tested using three batches of each device for all formats.

Compounds that showed no interference at a concentration of $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ are summarized in the following tables. There were no differences observed for different formats.

# f. Specificity

To test the specificity, drug metabolites and other components that are likely to interfere in urine samples were tested using three batches of each device for all formats. The obtained lowest detectable concentration was used to calculate the cross-reactivity. There were no differences observed for different formats.

# g. Effect of Urine Specific Gravity and Urine pH

To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine $\mathrm { p H } _ { \mathrm { : } }$ , urine samples with of 1.000 to 1.035 specific gravity or urine samples with $\mathrm { p H } ~ 4$ to 9 were spiked with target drugs at $2 5 \%$ below and $2 5 \%$ above cut-off levels. These samples were tested using three batches of each device for all formats. Results were all positive for samples at and above $+ 2 5 \%$ cut-off and all negative for samples at and below $- 2 5 \%$ Cut-Off. There were no differences observed for different formats.

# 2. Comparison Studies

The method comparison studies for the Secobarbital Test, the Buprenorphine Test and the Methadone Test were performed in-house with three different laboratory assistants for each format

of the device. Operators ran 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered clinical samples. The samples were blind labeled and compared to GC/MS results. The results are presented in the tables below:

Lay-user study

A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 560 lay persons testing each of the Secobarbital, the Buprenorphine and the Methadone devices. Total of 1680 individuals performed the study. A total of 190 females and 370 males tested the Secobarbital samples, 217 females and 343 males tested the Buprenorphine samples and 216 females and 344 males tested the Methadone samples. They had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 21 to $>$ 50 years. Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations; negative, $+ / - 7 5 \% , + / - 5 0 \%$ , $+ / - 2 5 \%$ of the cutoff by spiking drugs into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by GC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers and blind-labeled. Each participant was provided with the package insert, 1 blind labeled sample and a device. The results are summarized below.
