3. Interference - Structurally non-similar compounds, endogenous compounds, the effect of $\mathrm { p H }$ and the effect of specific gravity was evaluated by spiking the potential interferent into drug free urine containing the target analyte at $\pm 2 5 \%$ of the cutoff. All potential interferents analyzed verified that assay performance is unaffected by externally ingested compounds or an internally existing physiological condition. The instrument used for this test was a Beckman Coulter AU 400e.

The stability study supported an initial open vial expiration date of 28 days at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The instrument used for this test was Beckman Coulter AU 400e.

7. Calibrator and Control Analytical Performance – Immunalysis EDDP Urine Calibrators and Controls

a. EDDP Calibrators and Controls Traceability – all components of the calibrators and controls have been traced to a commercially available standard solution.

c. EDDP Calibrators and Controls Closed Vial Upright Stability – A closed vial upright accelerated stability study was performed at $3 7 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to establish the initial vial expiration dating. The stability study supported an initial expiration date of 1 year at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for calibrators and controls. The instrument used for this test was an Agilent 1200 Series Liquid Chromatograph coupled to Agilent 6410 Tandem Mass Spectrometer. All calibrator levels (1, 2, 3, and 4) and all control levels (Low Control 1, 2, and 3 and High Control 1, 2, and 3) for EDDP were within specifications for Day 0, 3, 7, 10, and 13. This accelerated stability study was performed to establish initial expiration dating. Real time stability studies are ongoing.

d. EDDP Calibrators and Controls Closed Vial Inverted Stability – A closed vial inverted accelerated stability study was performed at $3 7 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to establish the initial vial expiration dating. The stability study supported an initial expiration date of 1 year at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for calibrators and controls. The instrument used for this test was an Agilent 1200 Series Liquid Chromatograph coupled to Agilent 6410 Tandem Mass Spectrometer. All calibrator levels (1, 2, 3, and 4) and all control levels (Low Control 1, 2, and 3 and High Control 1, 2, and 3) for EDDP were within specifications for Day 0, 3, 7, 10, and 13. This accelerated stability study was performed to establish initial expiration dating. Real time stability studies are ongoing.

e. EDDP Calibrators and Controls Value Assignment – Calibrators and controls are manufactured and are tested by mass spectrometry. If any of the analytes are not of the acceptable range, then the calibrator and controls is adjusted and re-tested. Values are assigned to the calibrators and controls once the mass spectrometry results are within the acceptable ranges.
