Dear Joe Shia:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

5. Intended Use:

The EGENS Urine Test Cup Morphine - Methamphetamine is a rapid test for the qualitative detection of Morphine and Methamphetamine in human urine at a cutoff concentration of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and 1000 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ , respectively.

EGENS Urine Test Cup Morphine - Methamphetamine test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive. For in vitro diagnostic use only. The tests are intended for over-the-counter and for prescription use.

8. Test Principle

The EGENS Urine Test Morphine–Methamphetamine test is a rapid test for the qualitative detection of Morphine and Methamphetamine in urine samples. The tests are lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays. During testing, a urine specimen migrates upward by capillary action. If target drugs present in the urine specimen below its cut-off concentration, it will not saturate the binding sites of its specific monoclonal mouse antibody coated on the particles. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate and a visible colored line will show up in the test line region. The colored line will not form in the test line region if the target drug level exceeds its cutoff-concentration because it will saturate all the binding sites of the antibody coated on the particles. A band should form in the control region of the devices regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite in the sample to indicate that the tests have been performed properly.

9. Performance Characteristics

1. Analytical Performance

a. Precision

Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of - $. 1 0 0 \%$ cut-off, $- 7 5 \%$ cut-off, $- 5 0 \%$ cut-off, $- 2 5 \%$ cut-off, at the cut-off, $+ 2 5 \%$ cut-off, $+ 5 0 \%$ cut-off, $+ 7 5 \%$ cut-off and $+ 1 0 0 \%$ cut-off. For each concentration, tests were performed two runs per day by three operators for 25 days. All sample aliquots were masked and randomized.

b. Linearity Not applicable.

c. Stability The EGENS Urine Test Morphine–Methamphetamine is stable at $4 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 24 months as determined by conducting accelerated and real-time stability testing.

Control materials are not provided with the device. The labeling provides information on how to obtain control materials.

d. Cut-off

Cut-off studies were conducted using a total of 125 morphine samples and 125 methamphetamine samples equally distributed at concentrations of - $- 5 0 \%$ , $- 2 5 \%$ , at the cut-off, $+ 2 5 \%$ , $+ 5 0 \%$ of their respective cut-offs. These samples were tested using three different lots by three different operators. Results were all positive at $+ 2 5 \%$ and $+ 5 0 \%$ cut-off and all negative at $- 2 5 \%$ and $- 5 0 \%$ cut-off for both morphine and methamphetamine. The following cut-off values for the test devices have been verified.

e. Interference

Potential interfering substances found in human urine of physiological or pathological conditions were added to urine containing target drugs (morphine or methamphetamine) at $2 5 \%$ below and $2 5 \%$ above the cut-off. These urine samples were tested using three batches of the EGENS Urine Test DipCard (or Cup) Morphine–Methamphetamine by three different operators. There were no differences observed for different formats. Compounds that showed no interference at a concentration of $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ are summarized below:

# f. Specificity

To test the specificity, drug metabolites and other components that are likely to be present in urine samples were tested. The target drug (Morphine or Methamphetamine), its drug metabolites and the related compounds were studied. These samples were tested using three batches of the EGENS Urine Test DipCard (or Cup) Morphine–Methamphetamine by three different operators. The drug metabolites and other components were tested at different concentrations. The obtained lowest detectable concentration was used to calculate the cross-reactivity. Results are shown in the following tables. There were no differences observed for different formats.

# g. Effect of Specific Gravity and Urine pH

Twelve urine samples of normal, high, and low specific gravity ranges (1.000 to 1.035) were collected and spiked with either Morphine or Methamphetamine at $2 5 \%$ below and $2 5 \%$ above the corresponding cut-off level. These samples were tested using three batches of the EGENS Urine Test DipCard (or Cup) Morphine-Methamphetamine by three different operators.

The pH of an aliquot negative urine pool was adjusted to $\mathsf { p H }$ ranges of 4.00 to 9.00 in $1 \ p \mathrm { H }$ unit increments and spiked with Morphine or Methamphetamine at $2 5 \%$ below and $2 5 \%$ above the corresponding cut-off levels. These samples were tested using three batches of the EGENS Urine Test DipCard (or Cup) Morphine - Methamphetamine by three different operators.

The device performance was found to not be affected by varying specific gravity and pH. There were no differences observed for different formats.

2. Comparison Studies

The method comparison for the EGENS Urine Test DipCard (Cup) Morphine - Methamphetamine was performed in-house with three laboratory assistants for each format. Operators ran 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered clinical samples. The samples were masked and randomized. The obtained test results were compared to GC/MS results. The results are presented in the table below:

Lay-user study

A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 560 lay persons, of which, 80 tested for drug-free samples, 240 for morphine samples, 240 for methamphetamine samples. They had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 21 to ${ > } 5 0$ years. Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations; $- 1 0 0 \%$ , $+ / - 7 5 \%$ , $+ / - 5 0 \%$ , $+ / - 2 5 \%$ of the cut-off by spiking drugs into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by GC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers, blind-labeled and randomized. Each participant was provided with the package insert, 1 blind labeled sample and a device. The results are summarized below:

Lay-users were also given surveys on the ease of understanding the package insert instructions. All lay users indicated that the device instructions can be easily followed A Flesch-Kincaid reading analysis was performed on the package insert and the score revealed a reading grade level of less than 7.

3. Clinical Studies

Not applicable.

10. Conclusion

Based on the test principle and performance characteristics of the device, it’s concluded that EGENS Urine Test DipCard Morphine –Methamphetamine and EGENS Urine Test Cup Morphine – Methamphetamine are substantially equivalent to the predicate.
