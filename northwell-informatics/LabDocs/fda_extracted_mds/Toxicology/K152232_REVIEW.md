# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced

# L. Test Principle:

The test consists of two parts; a pre-analytical hair treatment procedure (to extract Cocaine from the solid hair matrix to a measurable liquid matrix), and the screening assay. The screening assay is an Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA).

This assay requires a sample of head hair (approximately 120 strands) that is cut as close as possible to the scalp, preferably from the back of the head at the crown. The hair sample is treated with a pre-analytical treatment to extract cocaine from the hair into a liquid sample. The liquid sample is added to a well of the microplate and enzyme conjugate is added, followed by incubation. During this phase the enzyme-labeled drug conjugate competes with drug in the liquid sample for a limited number of binding sites on the mouse antibody-coated micro wells. A wash solution is applied to remove any unbound materials. Enzyme substrate solution containing a chromogen is added. The reaction is stopped with an acid and the absorbance is read using a plate reader at $4 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ and a background reading is also taken at $6 2 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . Color intensity is inversely proportional to the amount of drug present in the sample.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability

Calibrator and controls are prepared from Certified Reference Material Cerilliant C008 Cocaine $1 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / m L }$ in Acetonitrile.

Stability

Shelf-life: The accelerated and real-time stability support the shelf-life of 6 months for the reagent kit (including calibrators and controls), stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Open vial stability: The study support an open vial claim of 30 days, stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for all kit components, including the cutoff calibrator and controls.

Hair Specimen Stability: Established in k023626.

Shipping study:

In order to demonstrate the stability of cocaine in hair specimens during the shipping process, 56 hair samples- twenty eight (28) confirmed positive cocaine hair specimens, of which three specimens (3) have pre-shipping quantitative GC/MS results in the near cutoff positive concentration range (300 to $4 4 9 \ : \mathrm { p g / m g }$ Cocaine) and twenty eight (28) confirmed negative cocaine hair specimens, of which three (3) have pre-shipping quantitative GC/MS results in the near cutoff negative concentration range (150 to $2 9 9 \mathrm { p g / m g }$ Cocaine) were shipped to eight different geographical locations and the temperatures tracked during shipping. By enclosing an electronic temperature sensor within each shipment of hair samples, we were able to retrieve a range of temperatures collected every 20 minutes during the shipping process. In order to mimic potential shipping extreme temperatures, the hair was first cold shocked at ${ } _ { - 1 5 } { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 15 hours and then heat shocked at $+ 4 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 6 hours prior to shipping.

After the boxes were returned to facility, ELISA screening and GC/MS confirmation were performed on each sample and compared to the non-shipped results for the same samples. The cocaine negative samples that were shipped maintained their negative status both for ELISA screening and GC/MS with respect to cocaine levels. One of the borderline negative samples originally screened positive prior to shipping and all three of the borderline negative samples screened positive after shipping due to variability near the cutoff of the ELISA screening method. The cocaine positive samples that were shipped maintained their positive status for both the ELISA screening and the GC/MS confirmation with respect to cocaine levels.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference:

One hundred and forty three commonly used compounds, many of them prescribed medicines, and abused drugs, were tested in the study. These compounds are not pharmacologically or structurally related to Cocaine. Each compound was tested at $1 0 { , } 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (equivalent to $3 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m g }$ of hair), in hair matrix pools at two cocaine concentrations, equivalent to $50 \%$ below $( 1 5 0 \mathrm { p g / m g ) }$ and $50 \%$ above (450 $\mathsf { p g } / \mathsf { m g } )$ the Cocaine cutoff value of $3 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m g }$ .

Prepared samples were run in singlet on the Quest Diagnostics Hair Cocaine ELISA. If the OD of the above cutoff pool samples spiked with compound of interest was positive (had an OD lower than or equal to the cutoff), then the tested compounded was considered to not negatively interfere. If either the below cutoff pool spiked sample or above cutoff pool spiked sample had a response that showed interference, that sample was diluted 1 :2 in corresponding below cutoff pool or above cutoff pool until no interference was observed.

The lists of compounds that do not interfere are listed in the table below and are provided in the product labeling.

# Cross-reactivity

Cocaine, structurally-related compounds, pharmacologically-related compounds, and metabolites were tested for cross-reactivity in the assay. Eleven (11) compounds, structurally related to cocaine and known cocaine metabolites, were selected for the study (see table below for the list). The cross-reactant solutions were prepared by adding the compounds to negative hair matrix. The concentrations listed below produced a result approximately equal to the cutoff calibrator.

Serial dilutions of each compound were prepared and analyzed. If the OD response of the spiked sample was positive then the spiked sample was diluted further with finer dilutions until a positive result was obtained with an OD within $5 \%$ of the cutoff value (sample OD/Cutoff OD). Cross reactivity was calculated as: (Cutoff Concentration/Lowest Cross Reactant Concentration with a Positive Result) $\textbf { \em X } 1 0 0$ .

The results are shown in the table below:

# Cosmetic treatment

A panel of sixty (60) confirmed positive cocaine hair samples and sixty (60) screened negative cocaine hair samples were either treated with one of five (5) cosmetic hair treatments or left untreated. Cocaine positive hair is defined as a hair sample confirmed by GC/MS as having greater than $3 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m g }$ cocaine. Absorbance readings after treatment were compared to absorbance readings prior to treatment, with the resulting change and direction of change noted. The resulting changes in ELISA test results are also noted, and are included in the table(s) below. (Absorbance values are normalized to the absorbance value of the cutoff calibrator absorbance value.)

This study agrees with the extensive published literature that use of various cosmetic hair treatments can potentially reduce the amount of drugs and drug metabolites detected in hair specimens. It is possible that a cosmetic hair treatment could cause a negative hair sample to read positive or a positive hair sample to read negative. These effects are dependent upon the nature of the hair specimen and the treatment used and independent

of the method of analysis.

f. Assay cut-off:

The Assay cut-off is 300 pg cocaine/mg hair. Analytical performance of the device around the claimed cutoff is described in the precision section M.1a above.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A total of 100 donor head hair specimens were analyzed in singlet using the candidate assay and GC/MS. The results are summarized below:
