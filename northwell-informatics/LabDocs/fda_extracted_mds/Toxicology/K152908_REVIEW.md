The tests are intended for over-the-counter (OTC) consumer use as the first step in a twostep process to provide the consumers with information concerning the presence or absence of the above stated drugs or their metabolites in a urine sample. Information regarding confirmatory test in the second step of the two-step process, is provided in the package labeling.

The test configuration comes with single drug screening test or any combinations of multiple drug screening tests. The tests will yield preliminary positive results when the prescription drugs Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines, Buprenorphine, Oxycodone,

Propoxyphene, Tricyclic Antidepressants are ingested, even at or above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly recognized drug levels for Barbiturate, Benzodiazepines, Buprenorphine, Oxycodone, Propoxyphene, Tricyclic Antidepressant in urine. The multidrug of abuse urine test device shows the drug was or was not present at the cutoff level. The tests provide only preliminary test results, which must be confirmed by other methods such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Clinical considerations and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated. The tests are not intended to be used in monitoring the drug levels.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not applicable.

# L. Test Principle:

The UCP Home™ Drug Screening Cups and The UCP Home™ Drug Screening Test Cards employ lateral flow immunochromatographic technology based on the principle of competitive binding. Drugs, if present in concentrations below the cutoff level, will not saturate the binding sites of antibody coated particles in the device. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-specific conjugate and a colored line will appear in the test line region. The colored line will not form if the sample contains drug in excess of the cutoff level because the drug will saturate all the binding sites of the drugspecific antibody. Each strip in the device contains a procedural control that appears in the control line region indicating that the sample has migrated properly on the test strip.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision/Reproducibility studies for the EDDP drug test were conducted by analyzing five different concentrations of EDDP in urine specimens: negative, $50 \%$ below the cutoff, $2 5 \%$ below the cutoff, cutoff, $2 5 \%$ above the cutoff, $50 \%$ above the cutoff, $7 5 \%$ above the cutoff and $100 \%$ above the cutoff. Each urine specimen, with each concentration of EDDP was prepare by spiking different concentrations of EDDP into drug-free normal human urine specimens (negative human urine), the final concentration of EDDP in urine specimens was confirmed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Each sample was tested four times daily for 20 non-consecutive days by one operator at each concentration. A total of 60 determinations tested by three operators were made at each concentration. The data are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable. These devices are for qualitative use only.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Procedural controls are included in the test strip and device. A red colored line appearing in the control zone is considered as an internal procedural control. It confirms sufficient specimen volume, adequate membrane wicking and correct procedural technique. Control standards are not supplied with these tests; however, it is recommended that positive and negative controls be tested as a good laboratory practice to confirm the test procedure and to verify proper test performance. Users should follow local, state, and federal guidelines to run the external controls.

# Stability:

Stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable. The information supports that UCP Compact Drug Test Cups and Cards unopened stability is 18 months. Real time stability testing is ongoing. (Instructions note that opened tests should be used immediately.)

d. Detection limit:

See Precision/Reproducibility section in M.1.a above.

e. Analytical specificity:

Analytical specificity and cross-reactivity for Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Opiates, Morphine, Phencyclidine, Barbiturates, Buprenorphine, Benzodiazepines, Methadone, Oxycodone, MDMA, Propoxyphene, and Tricyclic Antidepressants was established in the following 510(k) submissions: k061457, k091588, K091612, k110515, k122419, k123863, k130463, k131811, k132812.

Analytical specificity and cross-reactivity for the EDDP drug test was established by spiking various concentrations of similarly structured drug compounds into drug-free urine (negative control). By analyzing results of various concentration of each compound with the EDDP test, the concentration of the compound that produced a response approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay was determined. Results of those studies appear in the table(s) below:

EDDP   

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Compound</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentration at which theresponse was equivalent tothe cutoff of 300 ng/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cross-Reactivity</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300 ng/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Methadone</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&gt;100,000 ng/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&lt;1%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Doxylamine</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&gt;100,000 ng/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&lt;1%</td></tr></table>

Interferences for Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Opiates, Morphine, Phencyclidine, Barbiturates, Buprenorphine, Benzodiazepines, Methadone, Oxycodone, MDMA, Propoxyphene, and Tricyclic Antidepressants drug tests in UCP Compact Drug Tests were established in the following 510(k) submissions: k061457, k091588, K091612, k110515, k122419, k123863, k130463, k131811, and k132812. The following list of substances showed no interference at a concentration of $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ Acetaminophen, Acetylsalicylic Acid, Amikacin, Ampicillin, Arterenal, Asprin, Atropine, Benzoic Acid, Oxalic Acid, Caffeine, Methanol, Ethanol, Lidocaine, Thioridazine, Trifluoperazine, Penicillin-G, Phenylpropanalamine, Ranitidine, Salicyclic Acid, Albumin, Bilirubin, Creatine, Hemoglobin, Glucose, L-Ascorbic Acid, and Uric Acid when tested with the EDDP test.

Samples above and below the analyte cutoff were adjusted to obtain specific gravities of 1.002, 1.005, 1.01, 1.02, 1.025, 1.03, and 1.035. The cup and card formats with all drug test strips, and the EDDP single panel cup and card formats were tested at each specific gravity; the cup and the test card formats were tested separately.

The $\mathsf { p H }$ of samples above and below the analyte cutoff were adjusted to $\mathrm { p H } 4 . 5 , 5 , 6 .$ 7, 8, 9, and $\mathrm { p H } 1 0$ . The cup and card formats with all drug test strips, and the EDDP single panel cup and card formats were tested at each pH; the cup and the test card formats were tested separately.

The results demonstrated that pH and specific gravity do not affect the results from the device.

In a different study for the additional format, the sponsor performed a consumer study of UCP Compact Drug Test Cup with 115 lay persons in the three geographic regions. Fifty seven females and fifty eight from ages ranged from 18 and 77 years participated the studies. Fifty seven participants had high school education or less, fifty eight participants had finished college courses. None of the participants had experiences using drug testing products before. The urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations: $0 \%$ of cutoff, $50 \%$ of cutoff, $7 5 \%$ of cutoff, $12 5 \%$ of cutoff, $1 5 0 \%$ of cutoff and $300 \%$ of Cutoff. The urine samples with various drug concentrations were prepared by spiking pure drugs or drug metabolites into drug free human urine, the final drug concentrations in each urine sample were confirmed by GC/MS with the exception of TCA which was confirmed by HPLC. Each participant was asked to read the test instruction before performing the test, and then ran the test independently without additional help. The test results by the lay users are summarized below:
