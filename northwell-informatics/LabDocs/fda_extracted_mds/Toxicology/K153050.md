# 8. Performance Data:

# 8.1 Cross-reactivity with structurally similar compounds

To test the cross reactivity of the test, 2 lots of test Dipcard and one lot of test Cup was used to test with drug metabolites and drug structurally similar compounds in urine. All the components were added to drug-free normal human urine. Each sample was tested in 5 replicates using 3 lots of Test Cup and Test Dipcard. If any positive result was observed, the compounds were further diluted with known drug-free urine specimen sequentially to different concentrations and tested in quintuplicate, until the highest concentration that generates a negative result was identified. The cross reacting substances with the lowest concentration that produced a positive result was identified and is listed in the table below.

# 8.2 Interference

Clinical urine samples may contain substances that could potentially interfere with the test. The following compounds were added to drug-free urine or drug positive urine containing AMP, BAR, BUP, BZO, COC, EDDP, MDMA, MET, MOP, MTD, OXY, PCP, PPX, TCA or THC with the concentration $50 \%$ below the cutoff and the concentration $50 \%$ above the cutoff, respectively. All potential interfering substances were added at a concentration of $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ (All concentrations of the drugs were confirmed with GC/MS, or LC/MS,HPLC). The urine specimens were tested with two lots of the corresponding Rapid Single/Multi-drug Test Cup and Test Dipcard.

# 8.3 Effect of urinary pH

The $\mathsf { p H }$ of an aliquot negative urine pool is adjusted to a $\mathsf { p H }$ range of 3 to 9 in $1 \ \mathrm { p H }$ unit increments and spiked with each drug at $5 0 \%$ below and $5 0 \%$ above cutoff levels (All concentrations were confirmed with GC/MS, or LC/MS, HPLC). Each sample was tested by two lots of the corresponding Rapid Single/Multi-drug Test Cup and Test Dipcard. The results

demonstrate that varying ranges of $\mathsf { p H }$ do not interfere with the performance of the test.

# 8.4 Effect of Urinary specific gravity

The specific gravity studies were conducted on different specific gravity including 1.002,1.010, 1.020, 1.030, 1.040 specimens with drug free urine containing AMP, BAR, BUP, BZO, COC, EDDP, MDMA, MET, MOP, MTD, OXY, PCP, PPX, TCA or THC at $50 \%$ below and $5 0 \%$ above cutoff level (All concentrations were confirmed with GC/MS, or LC/MS, HPLC). Each sample was tested by two lots of the corresponding Rapid Single/Multi-drug Test Cup and Test Dipcard. The results demonstrate that varying ranges of urinary specific gravity do not affect the test result.

# 8.5 Precision

Precision studies were performed using the multi-drug test formats. Drug free specimens were spiked with analytes at 0, $\pm 7 5 \%$ cutoff, $\pm 5 0 \%$ cutoff, $\pm 2 5 \%$ cutoff and $+ 1 0 0 \%$ cutoff of drug. The concentrations of the target drugs were confirmed with GC/MS, or LC/MS, HPLC. Each concentration of the urine specimen was then divided into aliquots. Each aliquot was blindly labeled by a nonparticipant. Separate sets of blinded coded samples were assigned and randomized prior to testing. The study was conducted by 6 operators at 3 Point-of-Care sites. Two operators per location tested 3 aliquots at each concentration for each lot per day (3 runs/day) for 10 non-consecutive days using one device lot per location. One operator tested the test dipcard format and the second operator tested the test cup format. There were 1620 observations by 3 sites at 9 concentrations.

# 8.6 Accuracy

Multi-drug Test Cup:

80 clinical urine specimens for each drug were analyzed by GC/MS, LC/MS, or HPLC and by one lot of the corresponding Rapid Multi-drug Test Cup. Samples were divided by concentration into five categories: drug free, less than half the cutoff, near cutoff negative, near cutoff positive, and high positive. Results were as follows:

80 clinical urine specimens for each drug were analyzed by GC/MS, LC/MS, or HPLC and by one lot of the corresponding Rapid Multi-drug Test Dipcard. Samples were divided by concentration into five categories: drug free,less than half the cutoff, near cutoff negative, near cutoff positive, and high positive. Results were as follows:

# 8.7 Lay User Study

1720 lay users from age 18 to 65 years participated in the study. Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations: $0 , + / - 5 0 \%$ cutoff, $+ / -$ $2 5 \%$ cutoff and $+ 1 0 0 \%$ cutoff by spiking drug into drug free urine specimens. Each sample contain different drugs and the different concentrations. The concentrations of target drugs were confirmed with GC/MS, or LC/MS, HPLC. Each participant performed only 1 test on provided specimen with one format of Rapid Multi- drug Test (Dipcard, Cup) using the English package insert as guide to perform the test. They were asked to fill out an English questionnaire after finishing the test. Results were as follows:

1720 questionnaires were distributed collected. The results show that the test is easy to be used and the instruction insert is clear.

Evaluation of the readability of the labeling

The entire package insert readability was assessed. We choose 30 chain sentences from Instructions Insert at OTC user read. According to SMOG Conversion Table of Appendix B the SMOG Readability Formula of "Labeling of Home-Use In Vitro Testing Products: Approved Guideline: GP-14A5", the reading level belong to $7 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ degree.

# 8.7 Interference study

Interference studies were performed using the multi-drug test formats. Drug free specimens were spiked with single drug at 0, $\pm 5 0 \%$ cutoff and $+ 1 0 0 \%$ cutoff of drug. The concentrations of the target drugs were confirmed with GC/MS, or LC/MS, HPLC. Each concentration of the urine specimen was divided into aliquots. Each aliquot was blindly labeled by a nonparticipant. Separate sets of blinded coded samples were assigned and randomized prior to testing. The study was conducted by 6 operators at 3 Point-of-Care sites. Operators tested 3 aliquots at each concentration for each lot per day (3runs/day ) and lasted for 5 non-consecutive days. A total of 15 determinations were made by each site at each concentration. There were 180 observations by 3 sites at 4 concentrations.
