# L. Test Principle:

The Elecsys Digoxin assay employs a competitive test principle using a monoclonal antibody specifically directed against digoxin. Digoxin in the sample competes with the added digoxin derivative labeled with biotin for the binding sites on the ruthenylated antibody-complex. The total duration of the assay is 18 minutes.

By incubating the sample $( 1 0 \mu \mathrm { L } )$ with a digoxin specific ruthenium-labeled antibody, an immunocomplex is formed, the amount of which is dependent upon the analyte concentration in the sample. After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles and a digoxin derivative labeled with biotin, the still-vacant sites of the ruthenium labeled antibodies become occupied, with formation of an antibody-hapten complex. The entire complex becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin. The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then removed with ProCell. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity of the Elecsys Digoxin assay was assessed on the cobas e 411 analyzer according to CLSI EP6-A.

A high analyte serum sample pool spiked with digoxin was diluted with digoxin free human serum. Fifteen concentrations throughout the measuring range were prepared. Samples were measured in triplicate within a single run.

The linearity data were analyzed with regards to linear, quadratic and cubic polynomials according to CLSI EP6-A. In the first step, a linearity check was performed with a first order (linear) regression and then with higher order models (quadratic and cubic). Results of this study support the claimed measuring range of 0.4 to $5 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

A dilution study was performed to determine the recommended dilution factor for samples. The dilution study for Elecsys Digoxin assay was performed on two cobas e 411 analyzers using four human serum samples with Digoxin concentrations above the measuring range. Samples were diluted 1:2 manually and automatically by the instrument. Results support the recommended dilution factor of 1:2 yielding a diluted sample concentration of $2 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ or lower.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability

This method is standardized to United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) digoxin reference material

# Stability

Protocols and acceptance criteria for PreciControl Cardiac II control solution stability were reviewed and found acceptable to support stability of reconstituted control serum for up to 3 months at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 3 days at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , on-board the analyzer at 20- $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Controls should not be re-frozen after thawing. Protocols and acceptance criteria for stability of lyophilized control were reviewed and found acceptable to support stability of lyophilized control serum stored between $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for up to 18 months; real-time stability stability studies are ongoing.

# d. Detection limit:

# Limit of Blank (LoB):

The Limit of Blank (LoB) was defined as the highest apparent analyte concentration expected to be found when replicates of a blank sample containing no analyte were tested. The distribution of values for five analyte-free human serum samples was determined with three reagent lots on two cobas e 411 analyzers with two runs per day over a period of three days.

The sample was measured in one-fold determination in each run. In summary, 30 measuring points were collected per instrument for a total of 60 measured values per reagent lot. Results support the LoB of $0 . 1 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

# Limit of Detection (LoD)

The distribution of values for five low level human serum samples was determined using three reagent lots on two cobas e 411 analyzers with two runs per day over a period of three days. Each sample was measured once per run. In summary, 30 measuring points were collected per instrument for a total of 60 measured values per reagent lot. The Limit of Detection (LoD) was defined as $\mathrm { L o B } + 1 . 6 5 3 \mathrm { x }$ SDtotal where SDtotal refers to the total standard deviation of low analyte samples. Results support the LoD of $0 . 2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)

The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was defined as the lowest amount of analyte that can be quantitatively determined with the stated accuracy. The distribution of values for $\geq$ 4 low level samples each diluted to concentrations which covered the range between LoB to 2x LoQ was determined with three reagent lots on a cobas e 411 analyzer with six runs distributed over three days. Each sample was measured in two replicates per run with a total of twelve replicates per sample per reagent lot.

A set of ten human serum samples (sample pools spiked with Digoxin) with known concentrations in the specified LoQ-area (approx. from LoB to 2x LoQ) was evaluated for each reagent lot. Target values for the Low Level Sample Set were determined using mass spectrometry during Reference Standardization. Results support the LoQ of $0 . 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

# Cross Reactivity

A cross reactivity study was performed to determine the specificity of the Elecsys Digoxin assay with both co-analytes and cross-reactant compounds. A dilution series was prepared and assayed for each co-analyte and cross reactant with Digoxin concentration of 0.5 and $2 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# Human Anti-Mouse Antibodies (HAMA)

The effect of the presence of human anti-mouse antibodies in patient samples on the Elecsys Digoxin assay was assessed on the cobas e 411 analyzer. A high HAMA and HAMA-free serum pool were each divided into two aliquots and spiked with analyte to yield two different digoxin concentrations: 0.843 and $2 . 3 7 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Each high HAMA serum pool was diluted in 11 steps with the corresponding HAMA-free serum pool containing the same digoxin concentration. Each dilution was analyzed in 3-fold determination. The sponsor defined significant interference as recovery of the HAMA serum sample beyond $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the corresponding HAMA-free sample. No significant interference was observed at all tested concentrations.

# Endogenous Interference

The potential interfering effect of endogenous substances on the Elecsys Digoxin assay was determined on the cobas e 411 analyzer using human serum samples spiked with digoxin. For each interfering substance 3 serum samples containing low, mid and high concentrations of digoxin were tested.

One aliquot of each serum sample was spiked with the potentially interfering substance; another aliquot was spiked with the same volume of isotonic NaCl solution (dilution pool). The interfering pool was then diluted into the dilution pool in $10 \%$ increments. The recovery for each sample was calculated by comparison to the reference (unspiked) sample.

The sponsor defined significant interference as recovery of the digoxin sample spiked with potential interferent beyond $\pm 0 . 0 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ at concentrations less than $0 . 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , beyond $\pm 1 0 \%$ at concentrations between 0.8 and $4 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , and beyond $\pm 1 2 \%$ at concentrations above $4 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ when compared to the corresponding un-spiked reference sample. No significant interference was observed for any tested endogenous substance at the levels indicated in the table below:

# Exogenous Interference

To test for interference from exogenous substances, seventeen common pharmaceutical compounds were spiked into two human serum samples and tested with the Elecsys Digoxin assay. The analyte concentrations of the samples were approximately 0.6 and $2 . 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . In addition, 17 cardiac drug compounds were assessed using the same serum sample pools and tested with the Elecsys Digoxin assay.

For testing, two serum sample pools were divided into aliquots and spiked with the potential interferents. The interferent concentrations were determined based on recommendations in the CLSI guideline EP7-A2. The reference samples without interferent were spiked with solvent.

The digoxin concentration of the spiked samples was determined in triplicate and compared to the digoxin concentration determined for the reference samples (also measured in triplicate). These studies were conducted on a cobas e 411 analyzer.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: A method comparison was performed using the Elecsys Digoxin assay (K973112) as the predicate device.

A total of 168 human serum samples (all single donors, native and spiked) were measured in singlicate. Digoxin values ranged from 0.413 to $4 . 7 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

The study was performed on the cobas e 411 analyzer over 3 runs. Regression analysis for all samples comparing performance on the predicate device Elecsys Digoxin assay (X) and the new device Elecsys Digoxin assay (Y) are as follows:

# Anticoagulants

The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of anticoagulants with the Elecsys Digoxin assay was determined by comparing values obtained from native samples spiked with digoxin (single donors) drawn into Serum, Li-Heparin, K2- EDTA-, and $\mathrm { K } 3$ -EDTA-plasma primary tubes, and Li-Heparin Plasma Separation Tubes.

Either 65 or 66 serum/plasma pairs per sample material were tested in duplicate with one reagent lot on a cobas e 411 analyzer. Potential effects were assessed by Passing/Bablok regression analysis.

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not Applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not Applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not Applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not Applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The sponsor included the following information and references in the labeling:

The recommended therapeutic range for digoxin is $0 . 6 ^ { - 1 } . 2 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $( 0 . 7 7 - 1 . 5 \mathrm { n m o l / L } )$ (ESC Guideline $2 0 0 8 ^ { 1 0 }$ ) or even $0 . 5 \mathrm { - } 1 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $\mathrm { ( 0 . 6 4 - 1 . 3 \ n m o l / L ) }$ .20 Particularly the upper end of the therapeutic range is controversial and concentrations up to $2 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $( 2 . 6 \mathrm { n m o l / L } )$ may still be applied.6,7 Concentrations above $2 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ are generally considered toxic.21 Some overlap of toxic and non-toxic values has been reported.22 Therefore, clinical diagnosis should be based on clinical and laboratory data.

Each laboratory should establish an acceptable reporting format and identify procedures for the reporting of abnormal results. Each laboratory should investigate the transferability of the expected values to its own patient population and if necessary determine its own reference ranges.
