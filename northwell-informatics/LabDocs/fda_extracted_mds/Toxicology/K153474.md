1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability:

The drug values in the Detectabuse $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ control are validated by SAMHSA or CAP certified independent laboratories by using either GC/MS, LC/MS, HPLC, or Immunoassay screening. The controls are manufactured using reference standards supplied by companies including Cerilliant and Alltech Corporation. Accuracy is certified by purity determination using analytical tools including GC/MS, LC/MS, and NMR. Gravimetric preparation is accomplished using balances calibrated with weights that are traceable to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

# Metrological Traceability of Values Assigned to Control Materials

Detectabuse $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Liquid Control Urines have target value assignments for various drug constituents. Laboratories (or other end-users) are to use these target concentrations when performing screening or confirmation of drugs of abuse testing methods.

# Value Assignment:

The following procedure was used for value assignment

a. Assay Methodology used to assign values: Certified Independent laboratories test by either GC/MS, LC/MS, or Immunoassay screening depending on validated test method that is in use at time of testing.

b. Data Collection:

A minimum of 3 data points are collected for each assay. Data collected from at least two test sites, testing performed within 1 week of receipt of test samples.

# c. Value assignment Criteria:

An initial production batch is sampled as described in the protocol and single or multiple samples (depending on our past experience with the constituent(s), are ordinarily sent out to 4 or 5 certified laboratories, depending on the constituents being tested. Certain drug constituents are not routinely tested by all of our reference laboratories and, in this case, we identify at least 3 laboratories that are proficient in those constituents. Our target acceptance criteria Is $\pm 5 \%$ of the target value, but if we cannot get $\pm 5 \%$ agreement from our testing laboratories we will accept $\pm 1 0 \%$ , particularly in the case of certain drugs that are not routinely tested for such as Propoxyphene and Methaqualone. If a testing laboratory does not report within $10 \%$ of target we ask that the sample be repeated. Once we have an acceptable convergence of values from all of the testing laboratories the lot is released. In the case of Stat-Skreen $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ controls for on-site hand held devices, when available, the lot will also be tested on hand held devices listed for the constituents. In this case our criteria shall be that positive controls test positive and negative product tests negative on the device.

For our final testing of a lot by GC/MS or LC/MS at the end of its shelf life we aim for $\pm 1 0 \%$ of target value but will accept up to $\pm 1 5 \%$ for certain constituents such as Oxazepam that are known to have stability issues.

# Stability Protocol K153474

Biochemical Diagnostics performed stability testing on our Detectabuse $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ controls to verify the performance claims in our package inserts. Controls were tested at Room Temperature $( 1 8 \mathrm { - } 2 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ , Refrigerated $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ , Frozen (-10 to $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ). The protocol and conclusion are listed below.

# Protocol:

Refrigerated temperature on opened vial Detectabuse $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ controls was tested initially and again at 31 days. Controls run by Drugs of Abuse testing using FDA approved test methods.

# Conclusion:

Data support the 31-day open bottle stability at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for all analytes in the lots evaluated. All analytes tested passed specifications, Positive controls tested positive and Negative controls tested negative.

# Closed Vial $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) Stability

# Protocol:

Refrigerated temperature on closed vial Detectabuse $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ controls were tested initially and repeated at 1 year and 3 years. Controls run by Drugs of Abuse testing using FDA approved test methods. At expiration date (3 years from manufacture), all drugs tested were stable within $12 \%$ of target or original test value done at time of manufacturing with the exception of Oxazepam which dropped $1 5 - 2 2 \%$ after one year refrigerated. At study conclusion of 3 years, all drugs were within $1 5 \%$ except Oxazepam which dropped to $2 5 \%$ .

# Conclusion:

Refrigerated temperature storage is recommended until expiration date except for Oxazepam which showed a $1 5 - 2 2 \%$ drop when stored refrigerated unopened greater than 1 year. Results of other drugs found in our stock Detectabuse product line were within the acceptable criteria of $+ / - 1 5 \%$ from target until expiration date. We do not recommend long term storage (more than six months) refrigerated based on the results of the Oxazepam testing this information is listed on the package insert under unopened Storage & Stability information and under Limitations.

Limitations listed on package insert:

DETECTABUSE CONTROLS, OXAZEPAM STABILITY: Oxazepam has known stability problems in urine stored refrigerated, our studies indicates that Oxazepam will deteriorate when stored refrigerated for longer than 6 months.

# Closed Vial ( $- 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ Stability

Protocol: Multiple bottles of a single lot of individual or multi-constituent Detectabuse $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ controls were pulled from beginning, middle, and end of production , set aside and unopened bottles were assayed at time of manufacturing and again (unopened bottles) periodically. Studies are ongoing and sent for assay until expiration date. Studies carried out on product between 3 to 4 years frozen storage. Closed vial study samples were stored frozen within a temperature range of - $\mathrm { - 1 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ to $- 2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Study samples were tested by GC/MS or LC/MS using SAMHSA licensed laboratories or CAP inspected and certified as well as by our own in-house evaluations using GC/MS and/or FDA approved hand held devices.

# Conclusion:

Multiple studies were conducted using various different lots, tested initially and repeated between 3 and 4 years. Drug levels were quantitated by GC/MS or LC/MS and, all drugs tested were stable within $1 5 \%$ of target or original test value done at time of manufacturing, this information was used to support the limitations listed in our package insert.

# Room Temperature (18-21°C)

# Protocol:

Several lots of Detectabuse Controls were selected and stored room temperature for up to 31 days. The controls are not recommended to be stored at room temperature, but room temperature storage can occur during delays in shipping or by customer error. This data is used to support stability claims for the constituents of Detectabuse controls. Study samples were tested by GC/MS or LC/MS using SAMHSA licensed laboratories or CAP inspected and certified as well as by our own in-house evaluations using GC/MS and/or FDA approved hand held devices.

# Conclusion:

All drugs tested for 31 days by GC/MS or LC/MS and/or FDA approved hand held devices tested within $1 8 \%$ of target value or original test value done at time of manufacture.

# Stability protocols, with acceptance criteria, for the Detectabuse $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Liquid Controls Urine for ongoing stability testing of on-market product lots

Additional on-going stability studies are done on random lots of each formulation to ensure continued performance; customer satisfaction surveys are also conducted quarterly to receive feedback on product performance. Negative customer feedback on product performance will trigger retesting if warranted after investigation. Controls are tested initially, and if no negative feedback, repeated every 6 months until endpoint of study, unless otherwise indicated in a specific study protocol. A normal testing protocol is designed to mimic the end users use of the product in accordance with the package insert instructions.
