# I. Device Description:

The Detectabuse $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Liquid Controls Each bottle contains stabilized human based urine. The positive urine controls have been gravimetrically spiked with reference drug standards and /or appropriate metabolites. The negative controls are certified negative by a combination of immunoassay, GC/MS and/or LC/MS for the constituents listed on the target sheets. The products contain less than $1 \%$ sodium azide as a preservative. For assays sensitive to such as ELISA we substitutes a proprietary preservative approved by the manufacturers and DEA.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability:

The controls are validated by certified independent laboratories by using either GC/MS, LC/MS, HPLC, or Immunoassay screening. The controls are manufactured using reference standards purchased from commercial vendors. Accuracy is certified by purity determination using analytical tools including GC/MS, LC/MS, and NMR. Gravimetric preparation is accomplished using balances calibrated with weights that are traceable to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

# Value Assignment:

The following procedure was used for value assignment

a. Assay Methodology used to assign values: Certified Independent laboratories test by GC/MS, LC/MS, or Immunoassay screening depending on validated test method that is in use at time of testing.   
b. Data Collection: A minimum of 3 data points are collected for each assay. Data collected from at least two test sites, testing performed within 1 week of receipt of test samples.

# Stability:

The stability protocols for open and closed vial were reviewed and found acceptable. The testing supports closed vial stability for 36 months when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with the exception of oxazepam (oxazepam is stable for 6 months) and 48 months when stored at $^ { - 1 0 }$ to ${ } _ { - 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ . Open vials are stable for 31 days when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and 31 days when stored at room temperature $( 1 8 - 2 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ .

d. Detection limit: Not applicable   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable   
f. Assay cut-off:

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable
