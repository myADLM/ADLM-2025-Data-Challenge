# 807.92 (a)(4): Device Description

The ARK Oxcarbazepine Metabolite Assay is a homogeneous immunoassay based on competition between drug in the specimen and Oxcarbazepine Metabolite labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for binding to the antibody reagent. As the latter binds antibody, enzyme activity decreases. In the presence of drug from the specimen, enzyme activity increases and is directly proportional to the drug concentration. Active enzyme converts the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH that is measured spectrophotometrically as a rate of change in absorbance. Endogenous serum G6PDH does not interfere with the results because the coenyzme NAD functions only with the bacterial enzyme used in the assay.

The ARK Oxcarbazepine Metabolite Assay consists of reagents R1 anti-Oxcarbazepine Metabolite polyclonal antibody with substrate and R2 Oxcarbazepine Metabolite labeled with bacterial G6PDH enzyme. The ARK Oxcarbazepine Metabolite Calibrator consists of a six-level set to calibrate the assay, and the ARK Oxcarbazepine Metabolite Control consists of a threelevel set used for quality control of the assay.

# 807.92 (a)(5): Intended Use / Indications for Use

The ARK™ Oxcarbazepine Metabolite Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay intended for the quantitative determination of Oxcarbazepine Metabolite in human serum on automated clinical chemistry analyzers. The measurements obtained are used in monitoring levels of Oxcarbazepine Metabolite to help ensure appropriate therapy.

The ARK™ Oxcarbazepine Metabolite Calibrator is intended for use in calibration of the ARK Oxcarbazepine Metabolite Assay.

The ARK™ Oxcarbazepine Metabolite Control is an assayed quality control material intended for use in quality control of the ARK Oxcarbazepine Metabolite Assay.

For prescription use only. Caution: Federal Law restricts this device to sale by or on the order of a licensed practitioner.

# Summary and Explanation

Oxcarbazepine [10, 11-dihydro-10-oxo-5H-dibenzo[b,f]azepine-5-carboxamide] and eslicarbazapine [(S)-10-acetoxy-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenz[b,f]azepine- 5-carboxamide] are prodrugs that are metabolized to an active metabolite (10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxy-5Hdibenz[b,f]azepine-5-carboxamide). Oxcarbazepine Metabolite is often called 10-monohydroxy derivative (MHD) or referred to as licarbazepine. Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal, Novartis) is metabolized to two enantiomers (S)-MHD and (R)-MHD at a metabolite ratio of approximately 4:1, respectively.

Eslicarbazepine acetate (Aptiom, Sunovion Pharmaceuticals) is prescribed as adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures associated with epilepsy in adults. Eslicarbazepine acetate is [(S)-10- Acetoxy-10,11-dihydro-5Hdibenz[b,f]azepine-5-carboxamide] and metabolism to (S)-MHD is favored such that the metabolite ratio of (S)-MHD to (R)-MHD is approximately 19:1.

# ARK Oxcarbazepine Metabolite Calibrator

The ARK Oxcarbazepine Metabolite Calibrator is traceable to certified Oxcarbazepine Metabolite powder. The purity of Oxcarbazepine Metabolite in the certified raw material is determined by NMR and elemental analysis as performed by the supplier of the certified powder.

Bulk solutions of the ARK Oxcarbazepine Metabolite Calibrator are prepared volumetrically using a stock solution prepared by gravimetric addition of powder to solvent. The concentration of Oxcarbazepine Metabolite in the respective bulk solution must agree within $5 \%$ of its corresponding master calibrator.

Value Assignment: Testing is performed with the ARK Oxcarbazepine Metabolite Assay on the Beckman Coulter $\Delta { \mathrm { U } } 4 8 0 ^ { \mathfrak { P } }$ automated analyzer. Two calibrated runs are performed using the Master Calibrator. In each run, five replicates of Master Lot (reference) and Test Lot are tested as matched pairs for each calibrator level. Mean values for ten replicates are calculated. Test lot mean values are expected to match the Master lot mean values within $5 \%$ allowance.

# 807.92 (b)(1) and 807.92 (b)(2): Brief Description of Nonclinical and Clinical Data

The following performance characteristics were obtained on the Beckman Coulter $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { A U } 4 8 0 } ^ { \textregistered }$ automated clinical chemistry analyzer. Unless otherwise stated, a metabolite S:R ratio of 9:1 was used to evaluate performance.

# Limit of Quantitation (LOQ)

The LOQ of the ARK Oxcarbazepine Metabolite Assay was determined according to CLSI EP17-A2 and is defined as the lowest concentration for which acceptable inter-assay precision and recovery is observed $( \leq 2 0 \%$ CV with $\pm 1 5 \%$ recovery). The LOQ was determined to be 1.0 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ , and may depend on analyzer-specific performance.

# Recovery

Analytical recovery throughout the measurement range was assessed by adding concentrated Oxcarbazepine Metabolite into human serum negative for Oxcarbazepine Metabolite. The S:R ratio of each enantiomer was varied. The mean of six (6) replicate measurements of Oxcarbazepine Metabolite was tabulated as a function of the enantiomer ratio.

# Linearity

Linearity studies were performed as suggested in CLSI/NCCLS Protocol EP6-A. A $6 0 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ serum sample was prepared and dilutions were made proportionally with human serum negative for Oxcarbazepine Metabolite. Oxcarbazepine Metabolite concentrations ranged from 1.0 to 50.0 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . Linearity at specific dilutions was considered acceptable if the percent difference was $\pm 1 0 \%$ between the predicted $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ and $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ order regressed values or $\leq 0 . 2 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ below 2.0 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

# Assay Range

The measurement range of the ARK Oxcarbazepine Metabolite Assay is 1.0 to $3 7 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ based on clinical concentrations tested. Report results below this range as $< 1 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ or below the analyzer-specific lower LOQ established in your laboratory. Report results above this range as $> 3 7 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ or test a diluted specimen having a concentration within the measurement range.

Specimens testing initially above the measurement range may be diluted in Calibrator A and retested. Multiply the assay result by the dilution factor to obtain the concentration of Oxcarbazepine Metabolite in the undiluted specimen.

# Method Comparison

Correlation studies were performed using CLSI Protocol EP9-A3. Results from the ARK Oxcarbazepine Metabolite Assay were compared with results from LC-MS/MS.

# Interfering Substances

Interference studies were conducted using CLSI Protocol EP7-A2 as a guideline. Clinically high concentrations of the following potentially interfering substances in serum with known levels of Oxcarbazepine Metabolite (approximately 3 and $3 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ ) were evaluated. Each sample was assayed using the ARK Oxcarbazepine Metabolite Assay, along with a serum control of Oxcarbazepine Metabolite. Measurement of Oxcarbazepine Metabolite resulted in $\leq 1 0 \%$ error in the presence of interfering substances at the levels tested.

MHD-Glucuronide and Dihydro-dihydroxy-carbamazepine (synonymous with dihydroxy-derivative of oxcarbazepine or DHD) are secondary metabolites of Oxcarbazepine Metabolite (MHD). Oxcarbazepine and Eslicarbazepine acetate are parent drugs for MHD. Carbamazepine and its metabolites (Dihydro– carbamazepine and Carbamazepine-epoxide) are compounds structurally similar to MHD. All were tested for crossreactivity at the concentrations listed in the presence of MHD $( 2 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ in serum. MHDGlucuronide levels may appear in serum greater than MHD in cases of renal impairment16. MHDGlucuronide and DHD levels are not crossreactive.

The parent drug oxcarbazepine crossreacted $2 2 . 2 \%$ (as did Eslicarbazepine Acetate), although neither Oxcarbazepine nor Eslicarbazepine Acetate are expected to be present with MHD at a significant level due to rapid renal clearance. Carbamazepine and its metabolites also crossreacted in the assay; the possibility of co-therapy or transition of therapy should be considered.

# Drug Interference

Other anti-epileptic or coadministered drugs tested did not crossreact with Oxcarbazepine Metabolite-selective antibody. A high concentration of each compound was spiked into normal human serum with known levels of Oxcarbazepine Metabolite (approximately 3 and $3 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ and assayed along with a serum control of Oxcarbazepine Metabolite. Measurement of Oxcarbazepine Metabolite resulted in $\leq 1 0 \%$ error in the presence of drug compounds at the levels tested.
