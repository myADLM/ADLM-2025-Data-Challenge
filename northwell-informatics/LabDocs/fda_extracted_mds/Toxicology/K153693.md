Device Name Immunalysis Methamphetamine Urine Enzyme Immunoassay and Immunalysis Multi-Drug Calibrators

Indications for Use (Describe)

The Immunalysis Methamphetamine Urine Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay with a dual cutoff of $5 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The assay is intended for use in laboratories for the qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of Methamphetamine in human urine with automated clinical chemistry analyzers. This assay is calibrated against Methamphetamine. This in-vitro diagnostic device is for prescription use only.

The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of enabling laboratories to determine an appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as Gas Chromatography/ Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.

The Immunalysis Methamphetamine Urine Enzyme Immunoassay Kit provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC-MS or Liquid Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.

The Immunalysis Multi-Drug Calibrators are intended for in vitro diagnostic use for the calibration of assays for the analytes currently listed in the package insert: Benzoylecgonine, Methamphetamine, Morphine, PCP and Oxazepam. The calibrators are designed for prescription use with immunoassays.

3. Interference – Structurally unrelated compounds were evaluated in qualitative and semi-quantitatyive modes by spiking the potential interferent into drug free urine containing methamphetamine at $\pm 2 5 \%$ of the cutoff. All potential interferents analyzed verified that assay performance is unaffected by externally ingested compounds. The instrument used for this test was a Beckman Coulter AU 400e.

4. Interference – Endogenous compounds were evaluated in qualitative and semiquantitatyive modes by spiking the potential interferent into drug free urine containing methamphetamine at $\pm 2 5 \%$ of the cutoff. All potential interferents analyzed verified that assay performance is unaffected by internally existing physiological conditions. The instrument used for this test was a Beckman Coulter AU 400e.

8. Linearity/ Recovery - A linearity study in the semi-quantitative mode was conducted by spiking a drug free urine pool with a high concentration of methamphetamine as a high value specimen. Additional pools were made by serially diluting the high value specimen with drug free urine to achieve concentrations ranging from $2 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ to $2 2 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

10. Immunalysis Multi-Drug Calibrators Analytical Performance a. Traceability – all components of the calibrators have been traced to a commercially available methamphetamine solution.

b.Closed Vial Stability (Accelerated) – A closed vial stability study was performed at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to establish the initial vial expiration dating. All calibrator levels (1, 2, 3, and 4) were within specifications for Day 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 40. This accelerated stability study was performed to establish initial expiration dating. The stability study supported an initial expiration date of 12 months after testing on LC/MS. Real time stability studies are ongoing.

c.Open Vial Stability – An open vial stability study was performed at $5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to establish the initial open vial expiration dating on LC/MS. All calibrator levels (1, 2, 3, and 4) were within specifications for Day 0, 19, 26, 33, 41, and 60. This stability study supported an initial open vial expiration date of 60 days.

d. Value Assignment – Calibrators are manufactured and are tested by mass spectrometry. The negative calibrator is a processed, drug free urine matrix. The standard is compared to a reference negative standard to ensure that it is free of analyte. The non-zero calibrators are prepared by spiking a known concentration of oxazepam in the negative calibrator matrix. If any of the analytes are not of the acceptable range, then the calibrator is adjusted and re-tested. Values are assigned to the calibrators once the mass spectrometry results are within the acceptable ranges.

I. Proposed Labeling

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10

J. Conclusion

The information provided in this pre-market notification demonstrates that the Immunalysis Methamphetamine Urine Enzyme Immunoassay is substantially equivalent to the legally marketed predicate device for its general intended use.
