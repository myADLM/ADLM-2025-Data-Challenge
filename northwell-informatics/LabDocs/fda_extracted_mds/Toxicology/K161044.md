9. Test Principle

The AssureTech Methamphetamine Tests, AssureTech Phencyclidine Tests, and AssureTech Marijuana Tests are rapid tests for the qualitative detection of d-Methamphetamine, Phencyclidine and Marijuana in urine samples. The tests are lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays. During testing, a urine specimen migrates upward by capillary action. If target drugs present in the urine specimen are below the cut-off concentration, it will not saturate the binding sites of its specific monoclonal mouse antibody coated on the particles. The antibodycoated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate and a visible colored line will show up in the test line region. The colored line will not form in the test line region if the target drug level exceeds its cutoff-concentration because it will saturate all the binding sites of the antibody coated on the particles. A band should form in the control region of the devices regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite in the sample to indicate that the tests have been performed properly.

10.Performance Characteristics

1. Analytical Performance

a. Precision

Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of $- 1 0 0 \%$ cut off, - $7 5 \%$ cut off, $- 5 0 \%$ cut off, $- 2 5 \%$ cut off, cut off, $+ 2 5 \%$ cut off, $+ 5 0 \%$ cut off , $+ 7 5 \%$ cut off and $+ 1 0 0 \%$ cut off. These samples were prepared by spiking drug in negative samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by GC/MS. They are 0, 255, 509, 747, 1011, 1265, 1518, 1760 and $2 0 1 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ for Methamphetamine, 0, 7, 13, 20, 27, 33, 39, 45 and $5 3 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for Phencyclidine, and 0, 14, 28, 39, 53, 61, 73, 90 and $1 0 3 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for Marijuana. All sample aliquots were blindly labeled by the person who prepared the samples and didn’t take part in the sample testing. For each concentration, tests were performed two runs per day for 25 days per device in a randomized order. The results obtained are summarized in the following tables.

# c. Stability

The devices are stable at $3 9 . 2 ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } } } \mathrm { F }$ to $8 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) for 24 months based on the accelerated stability study at $4 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and real time stability determination at both $4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# d. Cut-off

A total of 150 samples of which 25 are native samples and 125 were spiked samples are used in the cut-off study. These samples are equally distributed at concentrations of $- 5 0 \%$ Cut-Off; $- 2 5 \%$ Cut-Off; Cut-Off; $+ 2 5 \%$ Cut-Off; $+ 5 0 \%$ Cut-Off were tested using three different lots of each device by three different operators. Results were all positive at and above $+ 2 5 \%$ Cut-off and all negative at and below $- 2 5 \%$ Cut-off for Methamphetamine, Phencyclidine and Marijuana .

The following cut-off values for the candidate devices have been verified.

# e. Interference

Potential interfering substances found in human urine of physiological or pathological conditions were added to drug-free urine and target drugs urine with concentrations at $2 5 \%$ below and $2 5 \%$ above Cut-Off levels. These urine samples were tested using

three batches of each device. Compounds that showed no interference at a concentration of $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ are summarized in the following tables. There were no differences observed for different devices.

# g. Effect of Urine Specific Gravity and pH

To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine $\mathsf { p H }$ , urine samples, with 1.009 to 1.030 specific gravity or urine samples with $\mathrm { p H } 4$ to 9 were spiked with target drugs at $2 5 \%$ below and $2 5 \%$ above Cut-Off levels. These samples were tested using three lots of each device. Results were all positive for samples at and above $+ 2 5 \%$ CutOff and all negative for samples at and below $- 2 5 \%$ Cut-Off. Specific gravity from 1.009 to 1.030 does not affect the test results. Similarly, $\mathsf { p H }$ from 4 to 9 does not affect the test result. There were no differences observed for different format of the devices.

# 2. Comparison Studies

Method comparison studies for the AssureTech Methamphetamine Tests, the AssureTech Phencyclidine Tests and the AssureTech Marijuana Tests were performed in-house with three laboratory assistants for each device. Operators ran 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered clinical samples. The samples were blind labeled and compared to GC/MS results. The results are presented in the tables below:

Lay-user study

A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 1638 lay persons. The lay users had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 18 to $> 5 0$ years. Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations; negative, $+ / - 7 5 \%$ , $+ / - 5 0 \%$ , $+ / - 2 5 \%$ of the cutoff by spiking drug(s) into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by GC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers and blind-labeled. Each participant was provided with the package insert, 1 blind labeled sample and a device. Each device was tested.
