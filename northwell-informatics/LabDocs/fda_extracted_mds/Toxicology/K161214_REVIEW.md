# L. Test Principle:

Wondfo Amphetamine Urine Tests, Wondfo Cocaine Urine Tests and Wondfo Methamphetamine Urine Tests use a lateral flow, one step system for the qualitative detection of d-Amphetamine, Benzoylecgonine or d-Methamphetamine in human urine. Each assay uses a monoclonal antibody-dye conjugate against drugs with gold chloride and fixed drug-protein conjugates and anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody in membranes.

When the absorb end is immersed into the urine specimen, the urine is absorbed into the device by capillary action, mixes with the antibody-dye conjugate, and flows across the precoated membrane. When sample drug levels are zero or below the target Cut-Off (the detection sensitivity of the test), antibody-dye conjugate binds to the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device. This produces a colored Test line that, regardless of its intensity, indicates a negative result.

When sample drug levels are at or above the target Cut-Off, the free drug in the sample binds to the antibody-dye conjugate preventing the antibody-dye conjugate from binding to the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device. This prevents the development of a distinct colored band in the test region, indicating a potentially positive result.

To serve as a procedure control, a colored line will appear at the Control Region (C), if the test has been performed properly because of the antibody-dye conjugate binding to antimouse IgG immobilized in the Control Region(C) of the device.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were carried out for Wondfo Amphetamine Urine Tests and Wondfo Cocaine Urine Tests using samples with concentrations of $- 1 0 0 \%$ cut off, $- 7 5 \%$ cut off, $- 5 0 \%$ cut off, $- 2 5 \%$ cut off, $+ 2 5 \%$ cut off, $+ 5 0 \%$ cut off , $+ 7 5 \%$ cut off and $+ 1 0 0 \%$ cut off. These samples were prepared by spiking drug in negative samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by GC/MS. All sample aliquots were blindly labeled and randomized. For each concentration, tests were performed by six operators in two runs per day for 25 days per device. The results obtained are summarized in the following tables:

Additional cross reactivity performance data forWondfo Methamphetamine Urine Test MET 500 (Cup, DipCard) are found in k122961.

For Wondfo Amphetamine Urine Tests and Wondfo Cocaine Urine Tests potential interfering substances found in human urine of physiological or pathological conditions were added to drug-free urine and target drugs urine with concentrations at $2 5 \%$ below and $2 5 \%$ above Cut-Off levels. These urine samples were tested by three operators using three lots of each device. Compounds that showed no interference at a concentration of $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ are summarized in the following tables. There were no differences observed for the cup and dipcard test formats.

Effect of Urine Specific Gravity and Urine pH:

To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine $\mathrm { p H }$ , urine samples for Wondfo Amphetamine Urine Tests and Wondfo Cocaine Urine Tests, with 1.000 to 1.035 specific gravity (1.000, 1.003, 1.008, 1.014, 1.018, 1.020, 1.022, 1.025, 1.028, 1.030, 1.032, and 1.035) and urine samples with $\mathrm { p H } 4$ to 9 (4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0) were spiked with target drugs at $2 5 \%$ below and $2 5 \%$ above Cut-Off levels. These samples were tested using three lots of each device. Results were all positive for samples at and above $+ 2 5 \%$ Cut-Off and all negative for samples at and below - $2 5 \%$ Cut-Off. There were no differences observed for the cup and dipcard test formats and the sponsor claims that $\mathsf { p H }$ and specific gravity do not affect urine testing results around each analyte cut-off.

# f. Assay cut-off:

Cutoff studies were performed for Wondfo Amphetamine Urine Tests and Wondfo Cocaine Urine Tests using a combination of clinical and spiked samples for each drug $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 5 0$ per drug). The testing protocol was identical for each drug. 25 clinical samples were collected for each drug. Concentrations of amphetamine and cocaine in the samples were determined by GC/MS. An additional 125 drug free negative samples were obtained for each drug and spiked with either amphetamine or cocaine at $- 5 0 \%$ cutoff, $- 2 5 \%$ cutoff, cutoff, $+ 2 5 \%$ cutoff, and $+ 5 0 \%$ cutoff. 30 samples were tested at each concentration for each drug in replicates of 30 using three lots and 3 operators $\mathrm { ( n { = } } 2 7 0 \mathrm { ) }$ ).

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The method comparison studies for Wondfo Amphetamine Urine Tests and Wondfo Cocaine Urine Tests were performed in-house with three different laboratory assistants for each format of the device.

3. Clinical studies: a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable. b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable. c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Consumer / lay person study:

A lay user study was performed by a total of 840 lay users at three intended user sites: two hospitals and one drug addiction recovery center in P.R. China. The Wondfo Amphetamine Urine Test devices were tested by 280 lay persons, the Wondfo Cocaine Urine Test devices were tested by 280 lay persons and the Wondfo Methamphetamine Urine Test devices were tested by 280 lay persons. The participants had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 21 to 63 years.

Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations; negative, $+ / - 7 5 \% , + / -$ $50 \%$ , $+ / - 2 5 \%$ of the cutoff by spiking drugs into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by GC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers and blind-labeled. Each participant was provided with the package insert, 1 blind labeled sample and a device (cup or dipcard). Layusers were also given surveys on the ease of understanding the package insert instructions. All lay users indicated that the device instructions could be easily followed. The lay user study was performed using English only labeling. A FleschKincaid reading analysis was performed on each package insert and the scores revealed a reading Grade Level of 7. The results are summarized below:
