Device Name DRI Hydrocodone Assay

Indications for Use (Describe) DRI Hydrocodone Assay:

The DRI Hydrocodone Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay for the qualitative and/or semi-quantitative determination of the presence of hydrocodone and its metabolites in human urine at a cut-off concentration of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . The assay is intended to be used in laboratories and provides a simple and rapid analytical screening procedure to detect hydrocodone and its metabolites in human urine. The assay is designed for use with a number of clinical chemistry analyzers.

The semi-quantitative mode is for the purpose of enabling laboratories to determine an appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as   
Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) or permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.

The assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method

B. Date Summary Prepared December 15, 2017

# C. Description of Device

The DRI Hydrocodone assay is supplied as a liquid ready-to-use homogeneous enzyme immunoassay. The assay uses specific antibodies that can detect Hydrocodone and Hydromorphone and Hydromorphone glucuronide. The assay is based on competition between a drug labeled with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and free drug from the urine sample, for a fixed amount of specific antibody binding sites. In the absence of free drug from the sample, the specific antibody binds the drug labeled with G6PDH and causes a decrease in

enzyme activity. This phenomenon creates a direct relationship between the drug concentration in urine and enzyme activity. The enzyme activity is determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm by measuring the conversion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH.

The assay consists of reagents (A and E).

Reagent A contains mouse monoclonal anti-Hydrocodone antibody, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in Tris buffer with sodium azide as a preservative.

Reagent E: Contains Hydrocodone derivative labeled with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in Tris buffer with sodium azide as a preservative.

# E. Comparison to Predicate Device

Both devices are exactly same product. The performance data collected for predicate is on AU 680 Analyzer and the performance data collected for this submission is on Indiko Plus. Both devices use same reagent and similar instrument systems. Both devices detect Hydrocodone and its metabolites. Both device’s specific antibody detects Hydrocodone and its metabolites at cutoff concentration of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . Comparison of DRI Hydrocodone Assay, Calibrators, Controls on Indiko and predicate devices demonstrated that the technological characteristics and intended use are substantially equivalent to the currently marketed predicate devices, DRI Hydrocodone Assay, (K150502)

# F. Test Principle

The DRI Hydrocodone Assay is supplied as a liquid ready-to-use homogeneous enzyme immunoassay. The assay uses specific antibody that can detect Hydrocodone and its metabolites. The assay is based on competition between a drug labeled with glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), and free drug from the urine sample, for a fixed amount of specific antibody binding sites. In the absence of free drug from the sample, the specific antibody binds the drug labeled with G6PDH and causes a decrease in enzyme activity. In the presence of free drug, the free drug occupies the antibody binding sites, allowing the drug bound G6PDH to interact with the substrate, resulting in enzyme activity. This phenomenon creates a direct relationship between the drug concentration in urine and enzyme activity. The enzyme activity is determined spectrophotometrically at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ by measuring the conversion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH.

# G. Summary of Supporting Data

1. Analytical Performance:

Performance is evaluated at the manufacturer’s site on Indiko Plus clinical analyzer.

\* Samples are discordant because of cross-reactivity of immunoassay to hydromorphone and hydromorphone- $3 \beta$ - glucuronide. $^ { \ast \ast }$ Lower Limit of Quantitation (LLOQ) is $4 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

e) Specificity - The cross-reactivity of DRI Hydrocodone and its metabolites, opiate compounds and structurally related and unrelated compounds are evaluated by adding known amounts of each analyte to drug-free negative urine. In both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes, the assay cross-reacted with Hydrocodone at $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ( $100 \%$ cross-reactivity), Hydromorphone at $3 2 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ( $9 2 \%$ cross-reactivity), Norhydrocodone at $1 3 , 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ( $2 \%$ cross-reactivity), Dihydrocodeine at $1 2 { , } 5 0 0 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ( $2 \%$ cross-reactivity). In semi-quantitative mode the assay cross-reacted with Hydromorphone- $3 \beta$ -glucuronide at $1 8 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ( $1 6 2 \%$ cross-reactivity).

In both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes, the assay exhibited minimal cross-reactivity with opiates and structurally related compounds at the tested concentrations.

In both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes, the assay produced a negative result when structurally unrelated compounds were spiked into $2 2 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ of hydrocodone (Low control level), at the tested concentrations. In both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes, the assay produced a positive result when structurally unrelated compounds were spiked into $3 7 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ of hydrocodone (High control level) at the tested concentrations. These results indicated there was no cross-reactivity of the assay to the structurally unrelated compounds.

h) Specific Gravity - Drug free urine samples with specific gravity ranging in value within 1.003 to 1.031 are split and spiked to a final concentration of either $2 2 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ or $3 7 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (the Low Control and High Control concentrations, respectively). These samples are then evaluated in both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. No interference is observed.
