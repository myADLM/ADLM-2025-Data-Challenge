Dear Ethan Liu:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/CombinationProducts/GuidanceRegulatoryInformation/ucm597488.htm); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm.

# 5.7 Test Principle

The BIO-VENTURE Rapid Amphetamine Test Cassette for OTC Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid Oxazepam Test Cassette for OTC Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid Cocaine Test Cassette for OTC Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid Methamphetamine Test Cassette for OTC Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid Morphine Test Cassette for OTC Use, BIOVENTURE Rapid Marijuana Test Cassette for OTC Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid Amphetamine Test Cassette for Rx Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid Oxazepam Test Cassette for Rx Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid Cocaine Test Cassette for Rx Use, BIOVENTURE Rapid Methamphetamine Test Cassette for Rx Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid Morphine Test Cassette for Rx Use, BIO-VENTURE Rapid Marijuana Test Cassette for Rx Use are rapid tests for the qualitative detection of d-Amphetamine, Oxazepam, Benzoylecgonine, d-Methamphetamine, Morphine and Delta-9-THC-COOH in urine samples. The tests are lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays. During testing, a urine specimen migrates upward by capillary action. If target drugs present in the urine specimen are below the cut-off concentration, it will not saturate the binding sites of its specific monoclonal mouse antibody coated on the particles. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate and a visible colored line will show up in the test line region. The colored line will not form in the test line region if the target drug level exceeds its cutoff concentration because it will saturate all the binding sites of the antibody coated on the particles.

A band should form in the control region of the devices regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite in the sample to indicate that the tests have been performed properly.

# 5.8 Performance Characteristics

# 5.8.1 Analytical Performance

# a. Precision

Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of - $- 1 0 0 \%$ cut off, - $50 \%$ cut off, $- 2 5 \%$ cut off, $+ 2 5 \%$ cut off, $+ 5 0 \%$ cut off and $+ 1 0 0 \%$ cut off, These samples were prepared by spiking drug in negative samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by GC/MS. All sample aliquots were blindly labeled by the person who prepared the samples and didn’t take part in the sample testing. Each concentration has three lots, and 6 operators have joined the performance. Each operator performs 9 samples for 25days per device in a randomized order.

# b. Linearity

Not applicable

# c. Stability

The devices are stable at $2 { - } 3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 24 months based on the real time stability study at room temperature.

# d. Cut-off

A total of 125 samples equally distributed at concentrations of - $. 5 0 \%$ Cut-Off; $- 2 5 \%$ CutOff; Cut-Off; $+ 2 5 \%$ Cut-Off; $+ 5 0 \%$ Cut-Off were tested using three different lots of each device by three different operators. Results were all positive at and above $+ 2 5 \%$ Cut-off and all negative at and below $- 2 5 \%$ Cut-off for Amphetamine, Cocaine, Oxazepam, Methamphetamine, Morphine and Marijuana.

The following cut-off values for the candidate devices have been verified.

# e. Interference

Potential interfering substances found in human urine of physiological or pathological conditions were added to drug-free urine and target drugs urine with concentrations at $2 5 \%$ below and $2 5 \%$ above Cut-Off levels. These urine samples were tested using three batches of each device. Compounds that showed no interference at a concentration of $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ and Ethanol at $1 \%$ are summarized in the following tables.

# g. Effect of Urine Specific Gravity and Urine pH

To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine $\mathsf { p H }$ , urine samples, with 1.002 to 1.036 specific gravity or urine samples with $\mathrm { p H } 4$ to 9 were spiked with target drugs at $2 5 \%$ below and $2 5 \%$ above Cut-off levels. These samples were tested using three lots of each device. Results were all positive for samples at and above $+ 2 5 \%$ Cutoff and all negative for samples at and below $- 2 5 \%$ Cut-Off. There were no differences observed for different devices.
