Dear Jesse Xia:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal

statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/CombinationProducts/GuidanceRegulatoryInformation/ucm597488.htm); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm.

# 9. Test Principle

The CLUNGENE Multi-Drug Test Dip Card, and CLUNGENE Multi-Drug Test Easy Cup are rapid tests for the qualitative detection of Amphetamine, Oxazepam, Cocaine, Marijuana, Methamphetamine, Morphine, Oxycodone, Secobarbital, Methadone, Buprenorphine, Phencyclidine, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine and Tricyclic Antidepressants in urine samples. The tests are lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays. During testing, a urine specimen migrates upward by capillary action. If target drugs present in the urine specimen are below the cut-off concentration, it will not saturate the binding sites of its specific monoclonal mouse antibody coated on the particles. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate and a visible colored line will show up in the test line region. The colored line will not form in the test line region if the target drug level exceeds its cutoffconcentration because it will saturate all the binding sites of the antibody coated on the particles. A band should form in the control region of the devices regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite in the sample to indicate that the tests have been performed properly.

10.Performance Characteristics

1. Analytical Performance

a. Precision

Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of $- 1 0 0 \%$ cut off, - $7 5 \%$ cut off, $- 5 0 \%$ cut off, $- 2 5 \%$ cut off, cut off, $+ 2 5 \%$ cut off, $+ 5 0 \%$ cut off , $+ 7 5 \%$ cut off and $+ 1 0 0 \%$ cut off. These samples were prepared by spiking drug in negative urine samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by LC/MS. All sample aliquots were blindly labeled by the person who prepared the samples and didn’t take part in the sample testing. For each concentration, tests were performed two runs per day for 25 days per device in a randomized order. The results obtained are summarized in the following tables for Buprenorphine, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Phencyclidine and Nortriptyline. The data for Methamphetamine, Morphine, Marijuana, Amphetamine, Oxazepam, Cocaine, Secobarbital, Methadone and Oxycodone were reported in k180255.

To demonstrate that there is no interference from each of the thirteen drug analytes on the other twelve drug strips, devices in both CLUNGENE Multi-Drug Test Dip Card and CLUNGENE Multi-Drug Test Easy Cup were tested using standard drug urine solutions at three fold cut-off drug concentrations of each drug analyte. Tests showed positive result only for each target drug and negative result for other drugs.

e.Specificity   
To test specificity, drug metabolites and other structurally related compounds that are likely to cross-react in urine samples were spiked into negative urine and were tested using three lots of each device. The lowest concentration that caused a positive result for each compound are listed below for Buprenorphine, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Phencyclidine and Nortriptyline. The data for Methamphetamine, Morphine, Marijuana, Amphetamine, Oxazepam, Cocaine, Secobarbital, Methadone and Oxycodone were reported in k180255. There were no differences observed between the CLUNGENE Multi-Drug Test Dip Card and CLUNGENE Multi-Drug Test Easy Cup.

# f. Effect of Urine Specific Gravity and Urine pH

To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine $\mathsf { p H }$ , urine samples, with 1.000 to 1.035 specific gravity or urine samples with $\mathrm { p H } 4$ to 9 were spiked with target drugs at $2 5 \%$ below and $2 5 \%$ above Cut-Off levels. These samples were tested using three lots of each device. Results were all positive for samples at and above $+ 2 5 \%$ Cut-Off and all negative for samples at and below $- 2 5 \%$ Cut-Off. There were no differences observed between the CLUNGENE Multi-Drug Test Dip Card and CLUNGENE Multi-Drug Test Easy Cup.

# 2. Comparison Studies

Method comparison studies for the CLUNGENE Multi-Drug Test Dip Card and the CLUNGENE Multi-Drug Test Easy Cup were performed in-house with three laboratory assistants for each device. Operators ran 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered clinical samples for each drug. The samples were blind labeled and compared to LC/MS results. The results are presented in the tables below for Buprenorphine, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Phencyclidine and Nortriptyline. The data for Methamphetamine, Morphine, Marijuana, Amphetamine, Oxazepam, Cocaine, Secobarbital, Methadone and Oxycodone were reported in k180255.

Lay-user study

A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 300 lay persons for each device format. The lay users had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 18 to $> 5 0$ years. Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations; negative, $+ / - 7 5 \%$ , $+ / - 5 0 \%$ , $+ / - 2 5 \%$ of the cutoff by spiking drugs into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by LC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers and blind-labeled. Each participant was provided with the package insert,

1 blind labeled sample and a device. Each device was tested. Results are shown below.
