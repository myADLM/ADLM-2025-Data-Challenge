Dear Feng-Yu Lee:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/CombinationProducts/GuidanceRegulatoryInformation/ucm597488.htm); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice   
(https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/) and CDRH Learn   
(http://www.fda.gov/Training/CDRHLearn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic. See the DICE website (http://www.fda.gov/DICE) for more information or contact DICE by email (DICE@fda.hhs.gov) or phone (1-800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100).

Device Name Single and Multi-Drug Rapid Test Cup With Adulteration (Urine)

Indications for Use (Describe)

The Single and Multi-Drug Rapid Test Cup With Adulteration (Urine) are rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of single or multiple drugs and drug metabolites in urine at the following cut-off concentrations: Amphetamine $5 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , Secobarbital $3 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , Benzodiazepines $3 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , Buprenorphine $1 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , Cocaine $1 5 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , Marijuana $5 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , Methadone $3 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , Methamphetamine $5 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , Methylenedioxymethamphetamine $5 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , Morphine $3 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $2 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , Phencyclidine $2 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , Nortriptyline $1 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , Oxycodone $1 0 0 \mathrm { n g / }$ mL, and 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine $3 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method.

Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.

For Prescription Use.

# 4. Device Description:

The Candidate Drug Screen Tests are rapid lateral flow immunoassays in which drugprotein conjugates in the test device compete with drugs or drug metabolites that may be present in urine.

On each test strip, a drug-protein conjugate is added to the test band of the membrane known as the test region (T), and the anti-drug antibody-colloidal gold conjugate pads are placed at the forward end of the membrane. Anti-drug antibodies derived from sheep and/or mice are used on the candidate tests. If target drugs are present in the urine specimen below its cut-off concentration, the solution of the colored antibody-colloidal gold conjugates moves along with the sample solution by capillary action across the membrane to the immobilized drug-protein conjugate zone on the test band region. The colored antibody- gold conjugates then complexes with the drug-protein conjugates to form visible lines.

Therefore, the formation of the visible precipitant in the test band indicates a negative result. If the target drug level exceeds its cut-off concentration, the drug/metabolite antigen competes with drug protein conjugates on the test band region for the limited antibody on the colored drug antibody-colloidal gold conjugate pad. The drug will saturate the limited antibody binding sites and the colored antibody-colloidal gold conjugate cannot bind to the drug-protein conjugate at the test region of the test strip. Therefore, absence of the color band on the test region indicates a preliminary positive result. A band should form in the control region (C) of the devices regardless of the presence of drug in the sample to indicate that the test has been performed properly.
