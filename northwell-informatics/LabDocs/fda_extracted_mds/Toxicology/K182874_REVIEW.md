# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): Refer to indications for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use:

Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test is a portable, non-invasive device to measure fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) in human breath. FeNO is increased in some airway inflammatory processes, such as asthma, and often decreases in response to antiinflammatory treatment. Measurement of FeNO by Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ is a method to measure the decrease in FeNO concentration in asthma patients that often occurs after treatment with anti-inflammatory pharmacological therapy as an indication of therapeutic effect in patients with elevated FeNO levels. FeNO measurements are to be used as an adjunct to established clinical assessments. Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ is suitable for children, approximately 7- 17 years, and adults 18 years and older.

Testing using the Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ should only be done in a point-of-care healthcare setting under professional supervision. Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ should not be used in critical care, emergency care or in anesthesiology.

# 3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ may not be used by children under the age of approximately 7 years, including infants, as measurement requires patient cooperation. Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ may not be used by children under the age of 7 years, or by patients who are unable to understand and execute the instructions given by healthcare providers, as measurement requires patient cooperation.

Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ should not be used in critical care, emergency care, or in anesthesiology. All subjects should refrain from eating or drinking for at least 60 minutes before the FENOM test. Recent intake of nitrate rich food, such as lettuce, spinach, beets, walnuts, peanuts, and animal organs, can lead to increased FeNO levels .

Smoking reduces exhaled NO levels. Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ results obtained from subjects who smoke should only be considered after considering the subject's smoking history and the potential impact on NO levels.

For prescription use only.

4. Special instrument requirements:

None

# I. Device Description:

The Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test (also referred to in short as Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ ) is a portable system for the non‐invasive, quantitative measurement of the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (NO) in expired human breath (FeNO).

The Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test is comprised of four major components (touch screen, handpiece, mouthpiece, breath conditioning cartridge). The main unit contains a touch screen interface for the use as well as houses the nitric oxide sensor and pneumatics needed to sample the patient’s breath. The patient interfaces with Fenom though the mouthpiece which is attached to the handpiece. The handpiece is connected to the main unit via a breath tube. The handpiece contains a breath conditioning cartridge which prepares the breath sample from the patient for proper analysis in the main unit. Both the mouthpiece and the breath conditioning cartridge are consumables.

The mouthpiece is a single patient use, disposable component that contains an antibacterial/anti-viral filter. The mouthpiece has an ergonomically designed oval interface to the patient to aid in creating a proper seal during the breath maneuver.

The breath conditioning cartridge is designed to remove humidity from breath samples. It is intended to be used 20 times before being disposed. It contains desiccant beads conditioned to a low dew point to ensure proper sample conditioning over the useful life of the cartridge. The device keeps track of the number of uses on the cartridge as well as independently measures the humidity of the breath sample after the cartridge to verify the gas sample humidity is within the device requirement for proper FeNO analysis.

# L. Test Principle:

Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test uses solid-state electrochemical sensor technology sensitive to nitric oxide (NO) compounds. The solid state sensor is preceded by a reactive filter material that renders (oxidizes) potentially confounding species such as carbon monoxide (CO), ammonia (NH4), and methanol (CH4O) inactive, or inert, to the NO sensor. Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ provides visual and audible feedback during its use. A user performs a breath maneuver by exhaling into Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test, and the Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test graphical user interface (GUI) displays an indication of the user’s breath flow rate, such that the user can modulate their breath flow rate to be within the acceptable limits. An electrochemical potential difference between the electrodes of the sensor develops and is proportional to the amount of NO in the gas sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Nitric oxide was mixed in a balance gas to simulate breath samples. Samples NO concentrations were determined using a chemiluminescence device calibrated against a NIST traceable NO tank. Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test results were collected by multiple operators over 5 operating days, 2 sessions per day, 4 runs per session with two replicates for each concentration, across five different devices using the

concentrations 10, 25, 75 and $2 0 0 \mathrm { p p b }$ $\mathrm { N } { = } 4 0 0$ per concentration). Repeatability is an estimated of variation within one test run in one day. Within-device precision is an estimate of variation between test runs and days. The repeatability and within-device precision over the five days was determined for each concentration as shown in the tables below:

# Clinical Precision

A multi-center, single visit, point-of care, inter-operator variability study was conducted to determine the repeatability of FeNO measured with the Fenom ProTM Nitric Oxide Test. 3 different operators at each site instructed each subject to perform two valid Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test measurements. FeNO levels in this study were assessed for a total of 127 subjects at 4 different sites by a total of 12 operators.

The table below shows the intra-subject precision of Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test measurements within six different measurement ranges.

\*Number of subjects, each providing two measurements.

An additional clinical precision evaluation, conducted with subjects under corticosteroid therapy, is provided in section 3.c.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Nitric oxide was mixed to create simulated breath gas to obtain 8 NO concentration levels ranging from 5-200 ppb (5, 10, 15, 30, 50, 100, 150, 200 ppb). Samples NO concentrations were determined using a chemiluminescence device calibrated against a NIST traceable NO tank. Five replicates were obtained with the Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test at each level, using two Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test devices.

Effects of extreme temperature, relative humidity.

The effects of temperature, relative humidity (RH) were assessed using the following conditions: $1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 2 0 \%$ RH, $1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 8 0 \%$ RH, $30 \% \%$ RH, $30 \text{‰}$ RH, and ambient conditions at $2 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 3 7 \%$ RH. For each sample, nitric oxide was mixed in a balance gas of simulated breath and the concentration of NO was determined using a NO Gas Analyzer. Each concentration sample was measured using 2 Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ devices, with each concentration tested in five replicates per device per test condition. The results support the claimed operating conditions for the Fenom $\bar { \mathrm { P r o } } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test: $1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $20 \%$ RH .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test is manufacturer calibrated and does not require calibration by the user.

The device is pre-programmed to allow a defined number of tests for the nitric oxide sensor. Stability study results were provided to support the sensor life of 250 tests or 50 hours of use, whichever comes first. Replacement of the sensor is done by the manufacturer.

The breath conditioning cartridge is a replacement part of the device. Stability study results were provided to support the claimed cartridge shelf life of 3 months. Once installed, each cartridge is pre-programmed to allow a defined number of tests (12 hours of use or 20 uses, whichever comes first).

The shelf-life for the mouthpiece is 24 months. The mouthpiece is a single patient use, disposable component that contains an anti-bacterial/anti-viral filter.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of detection for the Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test was determined based on CLSI EP17-A2. Two devices were tested at 0 ppb (60 replicates), 5 ppb (30 replicates) and $1 0 \mathrm { p p b }$ (30 replicates) over three days. Nitric oxide samples were mixed in a balance gas of simulated breath. The limit of detection was calculated using the parametric option in CLSI EP17-A2, using the following formulas: $\mathrm { L o B { = } \mu _ { B } { + } 1 . 6 4 5 \ \sigma _ { B } }$ and $\mathrm { L o D = L o B + 1 . 6 4 5 ~ \sigma _ { S } }$ . The results of the limit of detection analysis support the claimed detection limit of $1 0 \mathrm { p p b }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

# Endogenous substance interference

Interference testing was performed using simulated breath having 15, 30, and $5 0 \mathrm { p p b }$ NO. Five sensors were used to evaluate endogenous interference. The substances and concentrations tested are summarized in the table below. A substance was defined as non-interfering if the response at the tested concentration was within $\pm 4$ ppb NO.

# Exogenous substance interference

A clinical study was performed to investigate the influence of common orally consumed or used exogenous substances on FeNO results measured with Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test. Each subject performed one baseline measurement before the exogenous substance was introduced and one measurement 60 minutes post exposure or consumption. All subjects refrained from eating or drinking for 60 minutes before the FeNO testing. The results of the study are shown below and support that there is no significant effect of these exogenous substances on the

measurement of FeNO by Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test, if users allow one hour to pass before a FeNO measurement. The device labeling recommends that no food or beverage be consumed, and no smoking be done, for at least one hour before taking an FeNO measurement.

# Clinical Accuracy

Using the Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test, FeNO was measured in all subjects at baseline and after 2 weeks of corticosteroid treatment (follow-up). Testing was performed by 42 trained technicians. At study entry, the adult subjects $( \geq 1 8$ years of age) had FeNO levels $> 3 0$ ppb and children subjects $( < 1 8$ years of age) had FeNO levels $> 2 5$ ppb. The changes in FeNO (Mean ± SD) in these patients are summarized in the below table.

The relationship between the percent change in FeNO and the percent change in preand post-bronchodilator FEV1 from visit 1 to visit 2 was investigated. The magnitude of the FeNO change and degree of improvements in ACQ and FEV1 are different because the scale and precision of these metrics varies. The data presented in the table below indicate that FEV1 and symptom score (ACQ) are different metrics and are not directly correlated with FeNO as determined by Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test.

4. Clinical cut-off:

Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The expected values are provided from the literature. In the labeling the sponsor states, “Given that physiological and environmental factors can affect FeNO levels, in clinical practice, ‘healthy’ FeNO levels need to be established on an individual basis. However, most healthy individuals will have NO levels in the range $5 { \cdot } 3 5 \ \mathrm { p p b }$ (children slightly lower 5-25 ppb) when measured at $5 0 \mathrm { m L } / \mathrm { s }$ . (ATS/ERS Recommendations for Standardized Procedures for the Online and Offline Measurement of Exhaled Lower Respiratory Nitric Oxide and Nasal Nitric Oxide, 2005. Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2005;171:912-930).”

# N. Instrument Name:

Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

A user will perform a breath maneuver by exhaling into Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test, and the Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test graphical user interface (GUI) will display an incentive or indication of the user’s breath flow rate, such that the user can modulate their breath flow rate to be within the acceptable limits recommended by the ATS and ERS guidelines.

The Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test device evaluates the breath maneuver and determines if the breath maneuver was performed according to the ATS and ERS guidelines with regards to breath flow rate and duration. The breath sample is presented through the reactive filter that transforms interferent species into inert species for the sensor and then fluidly presents the gas sample to the sensor. An electrochemical potential difference between the electrodes of the sensor develops and is proportional to the amount of NO in the gas sample.

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device?

Yes or No ___x_

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device using wireless transmission?

Yes or No ___x_

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes _x _ or No

3. Specimen Identification: The patient performs the test in real-time and is identified by patient name.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling: The user obtains a breath sample by having the subject exhale into the device.

The manufacturer performs calibration for each Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test device.   
No calibration is required by the operator.

6. Quality Control:

Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test provides internal controls as well as an External Quality Control program for the user to verify the reliability of measurements.

The External Quality Control (QC) program consists of two parts: One positive control from a qualified staff member with a stable FeNO value providing a normal biological FeNO sample and a negative control consisting of a NO free gas sample which is generated by the device from ambient air.

The labeling states that QC Users must be over 18 years of age, non-smoker, no known airway diseases or chronic cold, preferably no allergies or asthma, and stable FeNO values between $1 0 { - } 4 0 \ \mathrm { p p b }$ . The device has built in QC rules and the user will see the Passed or Failed instructions after the daily QC is performed.

The process consists of performing four QC measurements, one per day, within 7 days. The negative control result must be ${ < } 1 0 \mathrm { p p b }$ . The positive control result must be with process control limits for control charts with subgroup size one as defined in "Understanding Statistical Process Control" by Donald L. Wheeler and David S. Chambers. The control limits are established as follows: the most recent result (V0) is compared to a rolling average (AVG) and the prior result (V1). The control limit is a multiple of the rolling absolute range (RAR), which is the average difference of successive results. The control limits are:

$| \mathbf { V } _ { 0 } - \mathbf { A } \mathbf { V } \mathbf { G } | \leq \mathrm { R A R } ^ { * } 2 . 6 6$ , or 5ppb, whichever is greater $\left| \mathrm { V } _ { 0 } - \mathrm { V } _ { 1 } \right| \le \mathrm { R A R } ^ { \ast } 3 . 2 6 8$ , or 5ppb, whichever is greater

When the QC has passed both criteria, the device is ready for clinical use. A QC test must be performed each day of use. If the QC tester does not perform a QC test in 30 days, the qualification is suspended and the QC tester needs to re-qualify.

# Analytical Accuracy

An accuracy study was performed to compare performance of the Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test device to a chemiluminescence device calibrated against a NIST traceable NO tank. Four Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Nitric Oxide Test devices were tested over six concentrations (10 ppb, 25 ppb, $7 5 \mathrm { p p b }$ , $1 0 0 \mathrm { p p b }$ , $2 0 0 \mathrm { p p b }$ , and $3 0 0 { \mathrm { p p b } }$ ) with ten replicates each for a total of 240 tests. For each concentration, nitric oxide was mixed in a balance gas of simulated breath.

# Biocompatibility testing

Fenom PRO Nitric Oxide Test device will be contacting patient’s gas pathway via air. In addition, the mouthpiece component will have direct surface contact. The contact duration is limited ${ < } 2 4$ hours). Based on the intended patient contact types and duration, the sponsor provided demonstrated acceptable cytotoxicity, intracutaneous reactivity, sensitization, and acute systemic toxicity for the device.

Effects of extreme temperature, relative humidity.

The operating conditions for the device is $1 5 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { C } { - } 3 0 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { C }$ , $20 \%$ RH. The effects of temperature, relative humidity (RH) were assessed using the following conditions: $1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 2 0 \%$ RH, $1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 8 0 \%$ RH, $30 \%$ RH, $30 \text{‰}$ RH, and ambient conditions at $2 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 3 7 \%$ RH. For each sample, nitric oxide was mixed in a balance gas of simulated breath and the concentration of NO was determined using a NO Gas Analyzer. Each concentration sample was measured using 2 Fenom $\mathrm { P r o } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ devices, with each concentration tested in five replicates per device per test condition. The readings from the candidate device meet the acceptance criteria of within $+ / - 5 \mathrm { \ p p b }$ at $1 5 \mathrm { p p b }$ , and $+ / - 1 0 \%$ at 75 and $2 0 0 \mathrm { p p b }$ . The results support the recommended operating conditions of $5 ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } } } \mathrm { C } { - } 3 0 ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } } } \mathrm { C }$ $5 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ to $8 6 ~ \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ ), $20 \%$ RH.

# Effects of altitude

The sponsor also tested device performance at the following atmospheric pressure range of 106 to $9 2 \mathrm { k P a }$ , equivalent to -1500 feet to $+ 2 5 0 0$ feet above sea level, and show that the device performance are not affected. The labeling states the operation condition of the device is from Sea level to 6500 ft.

# Q. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, as applicable.
