The tests are intended for professional use only. The tests will yield preliminary positive results when the prescription drugs Secobarbital, oxazepam, Buprenorphine, Oxycodone, Propoxyphene, and Nortriptyline are ingested, even at or above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly recognized drug levels for Secobarbital, oxazepam, Buprenorphine, Oxycodone, Propoxyphene, and Nortriptyline in urine. The multi-drugs screening tests (Cup and Panel formats) show the drug was or was not present at the cutoff level. The tests provide only preliminary test results, which must be confirmed by other methods such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Clinical considerations and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated. The tests are not intended to be used in monitoring the drug levels.

# 6- Test Format:

Atlas Multi-Drugs Screening Tests formats are Cup and panel.

# 7- Test Principle:

Atlas Multi-Drugs Screening Tests (Cup and panel formats) (Urine) are an immunoassay based on the principle of competitive binding. Drugs which may be present in the urine specimen Compete against the drug conjugate for binding sites on the antibody. During testing, a urine specimen migrates upward by capillary action. A drug, if present in the urine specimen below its cut-off concentration, will not saturate the binding sites of its specific antibody. The antibody will then react with the drug-protein conjugate and a visible colored line will show up in the test line region of the specific drug strip. The presence of drug above the cut-off concentration will saturate all the binding sites of the antibody. Therefore, the colored line will not form in the test line region. A drug-positive urine specimen will not generate a colored line in the specific test line region of the strip because of drug competition, while a drug-negative urine specimen will generate a line in the test line region because of the absence of drug competition. To serve as a procedural control, a colored line will always appear at the control line region, indicating that proper volume of specimen has been added and membrane wicking has occurred.

Figure 1: Test Principle

As shown in Figure 1 above, the specimen (A) migrates via capillary action along the membrane to react with the colored conjugate (B). Drugs present in the specimen below cutoff, will not saturate the binding sites of the gold-conjugated specific antibodies and not form a colored antibody-antigen complex(C). The gold-conjugated antibodies will then be captured by immobilized specific drug conjugate and a visible red band will form indicating a negative result (D). The absence of line formation in the test line region indicates a positive reading and that the drugs level of the test specimen is above the detection sensitivity of the test. In the control line region of the membrane, immobilized reagents capture colored conjugate regardless of the presence of the test specimen composition. The resulting visible red band (E) confirms that the assay is functioning correctly.

Goat antibody.   
Specific Drug antibody.   
Specific Drug conjugate.

Conclusion: Atlas Multi-Drugs screening Tests (Cup and Panel formats) gave similar result behavior to positive results when tested with the previous mentioned substances at their corresponding concentration in the table. Where results found to be negative even at high concentrations, the above table reports the concentrations as $> 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ .

# d) Interference (Interfering Substances):

The Drug-free urine samples were collected. Each sample had been spiked with drugs to the concentrations cut-off- $2 5 \%$ , cut-off and cut-off $+ 2 5 \%$ . These urine samples had been spiked with $1 0 0 \mathrm { { u g / m l } }$ of the various ingestible or physiological substances (albumin was evaluated at 20 $\mathrm { m g / m L ) }$ using Atlas Multi-Drugs screening tests ((Cup and Panel formats).

The obtained results showed that the following list of substances showed no interference at the concentration $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { u g / m l }$ (albumin was evaluated at $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L } )$ when tested with Atlas MultiDrugs Screening Test Panel and Atlas Multi-Drugs Screening Test cup.

# f) Effect of PH on Atlas Multi-Drugs Screening Tests (Cup and Panel):

The Drug-free urine samples were collected and tested by GC/MS or LC/MS to ensure they are drug free. These samples were spiked with drugs to the concentrations at $\pm 5 0 \%$ cut-off and $\pm 2 5 \%$ cut-off. The PH of these samples was adjusted to be 4.5, 5,6,7,8 and 9, respectively. The Cup and panel formats with all drug test strips were tested at each PH. The results demonstrated that the PH does not affect the results of Atlas Multi-Drugs screening tests (Cup and Panel) Formats.

# g) Effect of specific gravity on Atlas Multi-Drugs Screening Tests (Cup and Panel):

The Drug-free urine samples were collected and tested by GC/MS or LC/MS to they are drug free. These samples were spiked with drugs to the concentrations at $\pm 5 0 \%$ cut-off and $\pm \ 2 5 \%$ cut-off. The specific gravity of these samples adjusted to be 1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.025 and 1.030, respectively. The Cup and panel formats with all drug test strips were tested at each specific gravity. The results demonstrated that the specific gravity do not affect the results of Atlas Multi-Drugs screening tests (Cup and Panel) Formats.

# h) Clinical Study (Method Comparison):

The comparison study was conducted to compare Atlas Multi-Drugs screening Tests (Cup and panel formats) (Urine) with the GC/MS or LC/MS methods. Testing was performed on 80 Clinical specimens All samples used in this study belong to adults (males and females) with ages $1 8 +$ . Samples were used as is without any dilution or alteration (except PCP samples which were diluted as per the table mentioned below in the study due to difficulty in sourcing PCP real samples). The unaltered clinical samples had been confirmed with Gas Chromatography Method (GC/MS) and the unaltered clinical samples (less than $- 5 0 \%$ of the cutoff, near cutoff negative (between $- 5 0 \%$ and the cutoff), near cutoff positive (between cutoff and $+ 5 0 \%$ ) and high positive (greater than $+ 5 0 \%$ ) were tested using Atlas Multi-Drugs screening Tests (Cup and panel formats) (Urine). Test results per drug are summarized in the table below:

The obtained data from this study show that Atlas Multi-Drugs screening Tests (Cup and panel formats) (Urine) have relatively high sensitivity, Specificity and accuracy when compared to GS/MS or LC/MS methods.

# I) Stability Study:

# 1) Real Time Stability

Real Time Stability of the Drug of abuse rapid test was evaluated using samples from three different lots. These samples were placed in an incubator with the temperature calibrated at $2 { \pm } 1 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $3 0 { \pm } 1 \ ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ with relative humidity (RH) calibrated at $60 \pm 3 \%$ . A series of stability tests were performed each month from 0 to 24 months. Tests were assayed using urine specimens with the drugs concentrations of $0 \%$ Cut-off, - $2 5 \%$ Cut-off, $- 5 0 \%$ Cut-off, $+ 2 5 \%$ Cut-off, $+ 5 0 \%$ Cut-off. Results are read at 5 minute. The tests were performed according to the package insert.

Conclusion: Atlas Drug of Abuse Test Panel (Urine) is stable at the temperature of $2 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 24 months.

# 2) Accelerated Stability

Accelerated Stability of the Drug of abuse rapid test was evaluated using samples from three different lots. These samples were placed in an incubator with the temperature calibrated at $4 0 { \pm } 1 \ ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ with relative humidity (RH) calibrated at $60 \pm 3 \%$ . A series of stability tests were performed each week from 0 to 3 weeks (4 weeks in total). Tests were assayed using urine specimens with drugs concentrations of $0 \%$ Cutoff, $- 2 5 \%$ Cut-off, $- 5 0 \%$ Cut-off, $+ 2 5 \%$ Cut-off, $+ 5 0 \%$ Cut-off. Results are read at 5 minute. The tests were performed according to the package insert.

Conclusion: Based on accelerated testing equations where one week represents one year of stability at room temperature Atlas Drug of abuse test is expected to be stable for at least 24 months.
