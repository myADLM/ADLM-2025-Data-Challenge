Dear Joe Shia:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

Accurate Multi Panel Drug Urine Test Cup offers any combinations from 2 to 15 drugs of abuse tests but only one cutoff concentration under same drug condition will be included per device. It is for in vitro diagnostic use only.

The tests may yield positive results for the prescription drugs Buprenorphine, Nortriptyline, Oxazepam, Secobarbital, Propoxyphene, and Oxycodone when taken at or above prescribed doses. It is not intended to distinguish between prescription use or abuse of these drugs. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly in evaluating a preliminary positive result. The tests provide only preliminary results. To obtain a confirmed analytical result, a more specific alternate chemical method must be used. GC/MS or LC/MS is the recommended confirmatory method.

10. Test Principle

Accurate® Multi Panel Drug Urine Test Cup is a rapid test for the qualitative detection of Amphetamine, Buprenorphine, Secobarbital, Oxazepam, Cocaine, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine, Methamphetamine, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Morphine, Methadone, Oxycodone, Phencyclidine, Propoxyphene, Nortriptyline and Marijuana in urine samples. They are lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay. When urine sample is added to the cup device, urine is absorbed into the test strip and migrates upwards by capillary action. If the concentration of target drug presented in the urine sample is below the cutoff level, the target drug will not saturate the binding sites of its specific monoclonal antibody-coated particles. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate and a visible colored band will be formed on the test line region. If the concentration of target is beyond the cutoff level, the target drug will saturate the binding sites of its specific monoclonal antibody-particles, thus the antibody-coated particles will not be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate hence no colored band will be formed on the test line region.

A band should be formed on the control line region regardless of the presence of target drug or metabolite in the sample to indicate that the tests have been performed properly.

11. Performance Characteristics

# f. Effect of Urine Specific Gravity and Urine pH

To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity, urine samples with specific gravity from 1.000 to 1.035 were spiked with target drugs at $+ 5 0 \%$ cutoff and $- 5 0 \%$ cutoff levels. Three operators tested samples using test devices from three different lots. The results were all positive for samples at $+ 5 0 \%$ cutoff and all negative for samples at $- 5 0 \%$ cutoff, indicating that urine specific gravity between 1.000 and 1.035 has no effect on the accuracy and precision of the test device.

To investigate the effect of urine $\mathsf { p H }$ , urine samples with pH value from 4 to 9 were spiked with target drugs at $+ 5 0 \%$ cutoff and $- 5 0 \%$ cutoff levels. Three operators tested samples using test devices from three different lots. The results were all positive for samples at $+ 5 0 \%$ cutoff and all negative for samples at $- 5 0 \%$ cutoff, indicating that urine $\mathsf { p H }$ value between 4.0 and 9.0 has no effect on the accuracy and precision of the test device.

2. Comparison Studies

The method comparison studies for Accurate $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Multi Panel Drug Urine Test cup were performed inhouse with three operators.

Operators ran 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered urine samples. The samples were blind labeled and compared to LC/MS or GC/MS results. The results are presented in the table below:
