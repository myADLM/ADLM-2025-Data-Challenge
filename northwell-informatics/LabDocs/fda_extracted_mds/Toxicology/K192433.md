Device Name LZI Methadone II Enzyme Immunoassay

Indications for Use (Describe)

The LZI Methadone II Enzyme Immunoassay is an in vitro diagnostic test intended for the qualitative and semi-quantitative determination of methadone in human urine. The cutoff for both the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes of the assay is $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ for methadone. The assay is designed for prescription use on automated clinical chemistry analyzers.

The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of (1) enabling laboratories to determine an appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as gas or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS or LC/MS) or (2) permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.

The assay provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific alternative analytical chemistry method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS or LC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary test result is positive.

# Device Name and Classification

Classification Name:

Enzyme Immunoassay, Methadone Class II, DJR (91 Toxicology), 21 CFR 862.3620

Common Name: Proprietary Name:

Homogeneous Methadone Enzyme Immunoassay LZI Methadone II Enzyme Immunoassay

# Legally Marketed Predicate Device(s)

The LZI Methadone II Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) is substantially equivalent to the Methadone Enzyme Immunoassay (k023317) manufactured by Lin-Zhi International, Inc. The LZI Methadone II Enzyme Immunoassay is identical or similar to its predicate in terms of intended use, method principle, device components, and clinical performance.

# Device Description

The LZI Methadone II Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay with ready-to-use liquid reagents. The assay is based on competition between methadone in the sample and methadone labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for a fixed amount of antibody in the reagent. Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, and the methadone concentration in the sample is measured in terms of enzyme activity. In the absence of methadone in the sample, methadone-labeled G6PDH conjugate is bound to antibody, and the enzyme activity is inhibited. On the other hand, when free methadone is present in the sample, antibody would bind to free methadone; the unbound methadone-labeled G6PDH then exhibits its maximal enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH, resulting in an absorbance change that can be measured spectrophotometrically at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .

The LZI Methadone II Enzyme Immunoassay is a kit comprised of two reagents, an $\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ and ${ \tt R } _ { 2 }$ which are bottled separately but sold together within the kit.

The $\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ solution contains mouse monoclonal anti-methadone antibody, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), stabilizers, and sodium azide $( 0 . 0 9 \% )$ as a preservative. The ${ \sf R } _ { 2 }$ solution contains glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) labeled with methadone in buffer with sodium azide $( 0 . 0 9 \% )$ as a preservative.

# Intended Use

The LZI Methadone II Enzyme Immunoassay is an in vitro diagnostic test intended for the qualitative and semi-quantitative determination of methadone in human urine. The cutoff for both the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes of the assay is $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ for methadone. The assay is designed for prescription use on automated clinical chemistry analyzers.

The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of (1) enabling laboratories to determine an appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as gas or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS or LC/MS) or (2) permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.

The assay provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific alternative analytical chemistry method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS or LC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary test result is positive.

# Performance Characteristics Summary: Beckman Coulter AU680 Analyzer

# Precision

The assay tested in qualitative (ΔOD, mAU) and semi-quantitative $\mathrm { ( n g / m L ) }$ mode using a modified NCCLS-EP5 protocol. Methadone sample concentrations were prepared by spiking a methadone standard into a pool of negative human urine at concentrations $\pm 2 5 \%$ , $\pm 5 0 \%$ , $\pm 7 5 \%$ , and $\pm 1 0 0 \%$ of cutoff concentration.

Results shown below were obtained by testing all samples in replicate of two, two runs a day (one in the morning and one in the afternoon) for 22 days on one AU680 automatic clinical analyzer for a total of 88 runs. Samples were evaluated against the assay’s calibration curve in both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. One single lot of reagents, calibrators, and controls were used and stored at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ when not in use.

# Linearity

To demonstrate linearity of the entire assay range, a drug free–urine pool spiked with methadone at $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ was serially diluted. Each sample was run in 10 replicates and the average was used to determine percent recovery compared to the expected target value.

Observed values were obtained and acceptable if measurements were $\pm 1 5 \%$ of the expected values. Recovery values (Expected Value divided by the Observed Value) were considered acceptable between $8 5 - 1 1 5 \%$ .

Samples from the linear range of the assay $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ to $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } ) }$ ) were tested with recovery ranging from $9 3 . 7 \%$ to $1 0 4 . 9 \%$ .

Structurally unrelated compounds were additionally spiked into pooled negative human urine to desired concentrations (as described above). These solutions were then split into three portions; one without methadone, and the remaining two that were further spiked with methadone standards to a final methadone concentration of $2 2 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ or $3 7 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ (as negative or positive controls, $\pm 2 5 \%$ cutoff concentration, respectively). Samples were then evaluated against the assay’s calibration curve in both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. All samples were tested in replicates.

# Specific Gravity:

Samples ranging in specific gravity from 1.003 to 1.028 were split into three portions each and either left un-spiked or further spiked to a final methadone concentration of either $2 2 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ or $3 7 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ (the negative and positive control concentrations, respectively). These samples were then evaluated in qualitative mode. No interference was observed.

# pH Interference Study:

Negative urine and urine spiked with methadone to the final methadone concentration of either $2 2 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ or $3 7 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ (the negative and positive control concentrations, respectively) were adjusted to the following $\mathsf { p H }$ levels and tested by the assay. The $\mathsf { p H }$ adjusted solutions were evaluated against the cutoff calibrator.
