# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The ADVIA Centaur $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Digoxin assay reagents are available in two configurations consisting of either one or five ReadyPack primary reagent packs and the ADVIA Centaur DIG Master Curve.

Each ReadyPack consists of the following:

ADVIA Centaur DIG ReadyPack $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ primary reagent pack; Lite Reagent $2 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ reagent pack monoclonal mouse anti-digoxin antibody $( { \sim } 2 6 . 4 \ \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ labeled with acridinium ester in protein buffered saline with sodium azide $( 0 . 1 1 \% )$ and preservatives. ADVIA Centaur DIG ReadyPack primary reagent pack; Solid Phase Reagent 12.5 mL/reagent pack digitoxin $( { \sim } 2 \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ covalently coupled to paramagnetic particles in protein buffered saline with sodium azide $( 0 . 1 1 \% )$ and preservatives.

# B Principle of Operation:

The ADVIA Centaur Digoxin assay is a competitive immunoassay using digitoxin, which is covalently coupled to paramagnetic particles in the Solid Phase for a limited amount of acridinium ester-labeled monoclonal mouse anti-digoxin antibody in the Lite Reagent. Within the patient sample, the digoxin competes with the digitoxin, and an inverse relationship exist between the amount of digoxin present and the amount of relative light units detected by the system.

# VI Standards/Guidance Documents Referenced:

CLSI EP07: Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline—Third Edition

# VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

1. Precision/Reproducibility: Previously established in k932123.

2. Linearity: Previously established in k932123.

# 3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Testing of interferents was performed using the paired difference approach and was performed to simulate effect of partially filled blood collection plasma tube. Human K2- EDTA and lithium heparin pools, one at low and the other at high digoxin level for each matrix were used to titrate the anticoagulants. The nominal EDTA and Heparin concentrations are $1 . 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ and $1 5 . 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ in blood collection tubes respectively. EDTA and Heparin were spiked 3 times and 5 times the additive concentration for testing with the candidate device. Each of these sample matrices had an aliquot as a control (spiked with deionized water) and an aliquot spiked with interferent. Testing was performed on one ADVIA Centaur $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ system with one reagent lot in 10 replicates. The observed interference effect, Dobs, was computed as the difference between the means of the test and control samples.

Dobs $=$ Interference $=$ (test sample mean – control sample mean)

To report the level of interferent for a quantitative assay as percent $( \% )$ bias, the following calculation was used: $\% \ \mathrm { B i a s } = [ 1 0 0 ^ { \ast } \ \mathrm { D o b s } ] \ ,$ / [control sample mean]

The sponsor defined significant interference as a bias $> \pm 1 0 \%$ . Results are summarized below:

The sponsor also conducted interference testing to evaluate the effect of endogenous substances - Spironolactone, Canrenone and Potassium Canrenoate that may be present in specimens. Testing consisted of human serum pools at two levels of digoxin used to titrate the testing compounds in the paired difference approach, by dividing the two serum pools into aliquots and spiked with the possible interferents. The control samples without the interferent were spiked with the solvent. The digoxin concentration of the spiked samples was compared to the digoxin concentration determined for the control samples. Testing was performed on one ADVIA Centaur $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ XP system with one reagent lot in 8 replicates per sample. The observed interference effect, Dobs, was computed as the difference between the means of the test and control samples. Results are summarized below:

# C Clinical Studies:

1. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable.

2. Clinical Specificity: Not applicable.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable): Not applicable.

# D Clinical Cut-Off:

Not applicable.

# E Expected Values/Reference Range:

The sponsor included the following information and references in the labeling:

A therapeutic range of 0.8 to $2 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (1.024 to 2.56 nmol/L) has been previously reported for digoxin.1,2

It is important to point out that the distinction between adequate digitalization and toxicity in patients cannot be made on the basis of digoxin concentration alone. Findings must be interpreted with a knowledge of this limitation.

As with all therapeutic drug assays, each laboratory should determine the appropriateness of this range for the diagnostic evaluation of patient results.3
