# 807.92 (a)(3): Identification of the legally marketed predicate device

Predicate Device Name: ARK™ Topiramate Assay

Predicate 510(k) Number: K083799

# 807.92 (a)(4): Device Description

The ARK Lacosamide Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay based on competition between drug in the specimen and lacosamide labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for binding to the antibody reagent. As the latter binds antibody, enzyme activity decreases. In the presence of drug from the specimen, enzyme activity increases and is directly related to the drug concentration. Active enzyme converts the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH that is measured spectrophotometrically as a rate of change in absorbance. Endogenous serum G6PDH does not interfere with the results because the coenzyme NAD functions only with the bacterial enzyme used in the assay.

The ARK Lacosamide Assay consists of reagents R1 anti-lacosamide polyclonal antibody with substrate and R2 lacosamide labeled with bacterial G6PDH enzyme.

# 807.92 (b)(1) and 807.92 (b)(2): Brief Description of Nonclinical and Clinical Data

The following performance characteristics were obtained on the Beckman Coulter $\mathrm { A U } 6 8 0 ^ { \textregistered }$ automated clinical chemistry analyzer.

# Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)

The LoQ for the ARK Lacosamide Assay was determined to be $0 . 4 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ , and may depend on analyzer-specific performance. The LoQ was determined according to CLSI EP17-A2 and is defined as the lowest concentration for which acceptable inter-assay precision $( \leq 2 0 \%$ CV) and recovery $( \pm 1 5 \% )$ is observed. Pooled human serum was supplemented with lacosamide to give concentrations of 0.30, 0.40 and $0 . 5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . Eight (8) replicates of each sample were tested in each of five (5) runs to give a minimum of 40 replicates of each LoQ sample tested.

# Measurement Range

The measurement range of the ARK Lacosamide Assay is $0 . 4 0 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 2 4 . 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . Specimens containing lacosamide in higher concentrations $( > 2 4 . 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ may be assayed by dilution of the specimen into the measurement range for a quantitative result or otherwise reported as detected above the measurement range. Multiply the assay result by the dilution factor to obtain the concentration of lacosamide in the undiluted specimen.

# Recovery

Analytical recovery throughout the measurement range was performed by adding concentrated lacosamide drug into human serum negative for lacosamide. A certified stock concentrate of highly pure lacosamide was added volumetrically to human serum negative for lacosamide, representing drug concentrations across the assay range. Two analytical runs of three replicates of each sample were assayed on an automated clinical chemistry analyzer. The results of the six replicates of each sample were averaged and compared to the target concentration and percent recovery calculated. Recovery at all samples tested was within $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the expected sample concentration.

# Linearity

Linearity studies were performed as suggested in CLSI EP06-A. A $3 0 . 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ lacosamide serum sample was prepared and dilutions were made proportionally with human serum negative for lacosamide. Two analytical runs of three replicates of each sample were assayed on an automated clinical chemistry analyzer. The results of the six replicates of each sample were averaged. The data were analyzed using linear regression as well as non-linear fitted polynomial regression. Linearity at specific dilutions was considered acceptable if the percent difference was $\pm 1 0 \%$ between the predicted 1st and 2nd order regressed values at concentrations ${ \mathrm { > } } 1 . 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ , or $\leq 0 . 2 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ at concentrations $\leq 1 . 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . A linear relationship was demonstrated between 0.40 and $2 5 . 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ $( \mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 9 9 8 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 0 1 7 0 )$ .

# Interfering Substances

Interference studies were conducted using CLSI EP07-A3 as a guideline. Clinically high concentrations of the following potentially interfering substances in serum with known levels of lacosamide (2.0 and $1 5 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ ) were evaluated. Two analytical runs of three replicates of each sample (6 replicates total) were assayed using the ARK Lacosamide Assay, along with a serum control of lacosamide. The mean results of lacosamide were calculated and the percentage recovery relative to the serum control mean result was determined. Measurement of lacosamide resulted in $\leq 1 0 \%$ error in the presence of interfering substances at the levels tested.

# Specificity

Lacosamide is eliminated primarily from the systemic circulation by renal excretion and biotransformation. After oral and intravenous administration, approximately $9 5 \%$ of lacosamide administered is recovered in the urine and less than $0 . 5 \%$ in the feces. The major compounds excreted are unchanged lacosamide (approximately $40 \%$ of the dose), its O-desmethyl metabolite (approximately $30 \%$ ), and a structurally unknown polar fraction $( \sim 2 0 \% )$ . The plasma circulating levels of the major human metabolite, O-desmethyl-lacosamide, is approximately $10 \%$ of that of lacosamide. This metabolite has no known pharmacological activity.

The crossreactivity of O-desmethyl lacosamide metabolite $( 5 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ or $3 0 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } ,$ in the ARK Lacosamide Assay was not clinically significant $( \leq 3 . 0 \%$ crossreactivity). Lacosamide $( 2 . 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ or $1 5 . 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ in human serum) was tested in the absence or presence of metabolite at higher than expected concentrations of metabolite.

# Crossreactivity

The compounds listed below did not interfere with the ARK Lacosamide Assay when tested in the presence of lacosamide $( 2 . 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ and $1 5 . 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ ). Levels tested were at or above maximum physiological or pharmacological concentrations. Lacosamide concentrations of samples containing interferent were compared to the lacosamide level in a normal serum control. No significant interference was observed with other anti-epileptic or co-administered drugs at the concentrations tested. Recoveries ranged from $9 0 . 9 \%$ to $1 0 9 . 5 \%$ , within $10 \%$ of the expected level.

# Sample Stability

Serum specimens were shown to be stable for at least forty-eight (48) hours at room temperature $( 2 2 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ , twenty-eight (28) days when refrigerated $( 2 { - } 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ , frozen $\left( - 2 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \right)$ for at least 34 months, and after three (3) successive freeze/thaw cycles based on supporting data.

# Stability

Accelerated stability studies and real time stability studies support a shelf-life stability claim of up to 18 months for the ARK Lacosamide Reagents when stored unopened at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# On-Board Stability

Reagents were stable up to 60 days when stored on-board the instrument based on supporting data.

# Calibration Curve Stability

A stored calibration curve was effective up to at least 14 days based on supporting data.   
Calibration curve stability may depend on individual laboratory performance.

# Traceability

ARK Lacosamide Calibrators are prepared by volumetric dilution of high purity lacosamide (certified solution traceable to HPLC) into a synthetic proteinaceous matrix free of lacosamide.
