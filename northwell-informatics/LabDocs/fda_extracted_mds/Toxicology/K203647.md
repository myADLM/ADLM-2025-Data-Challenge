Device Name SEFRIA™ Methamphetamine Oral Fluid Enzyme Immunoassay

Indications for Use (Describe) For In Vitro Diagnostic Use.

The Immunalysis SEFRIA Methamphetamine Oral Fluid Enzyme Immunoassay is an enzyme immunoassay with a cutoff of $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ in neat oral fluid collected by Quantisal or Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Device. The assay is intended for the qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of methamphetamine in human oral fluid with clinical analyzers. This assay is calibrated against d-methamphetamine.

The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of enabling laboratories to determine an appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) or permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.

The Immunalysis SEFRIA Methamphetamine Oral Fluid Enzyme Immunoassay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/ Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.

# D. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The Immunalysis SEFRIA Methamphetamine Oral Fluid Enzyme Immunoassay is an in-vitro test to detect the presence of methamphetamine in human oral fluid samples collected by Quantisal or Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Device.

Methamphetamine is a stimulant drug usually used as a white, bitter-tasting powder or a pill. It is highly addictive and is rarely prescribed. When smoked, the vapor moves from the lungs to the bloodstream causing euphoria, increased energy and alertness, higher confidence, and motivation. Side effects include paranoia, tremors, loss of appetite, mood swings, and neuropsychological effects including deficits in episodic memory, executive functions, information processing speed, motor skills, language, and visuoconstructional abilities.[1] The disposition of methamphetamine in oral fluid has been well documented showing the main drug found after intake is the parent compound. Following single dosing of $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ and $2 0 \mathrm { m g }$ , concentrations over $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ of methamphetamine were detected in oral fluid.[2] Oral fluid has been shown to be a useful matrix for the analysis of methamphetamine in several areas including workplace drug testing, pain management compliance monitoring, and driving under the influence of drugs.

# E. INTENDED USE

For In Vitro Diagnostic Use.

The Immunalysis SEFRIA Methamphetamine Oral Fluid Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay with a cutoff of $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ in neat oral fluid collected by Quantisal or Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Device. The assay is intended for the qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of methamphetamine in human oral fluid with clinical analyzers. This assay is calibrated against dmethamphetamine.

The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of enabling laboratories to determine an appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) or permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.

The Immunalysis SEFRIA Methamphetamine Oral Fluid Enzyme Immunoassay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/ Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.

# G. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS

The following laboratory performance studies were performed to determine substantial equivalence of the SEFRIA Methamphetamine Oral Fluid Enzyme Immunoassay to the predicate device. Assay performance was established using the Beckman Coulter AU480 chemistry analyzer.

# 1. Precision

Precision study was performed over 15 days, 2 runs per day with 2 collection devices per run $\left( \mathrm { N } { = } 6 0 \right)$ ), one replicate per collection device on 1 lot of reagent and 1 lot of Quantisal and 1 lot of Quantisal II oral fluid collection devices. Drug free negative oral fluid was spiked to concentrations of assay cutoff and $\pm 2 5 \%$ , $\pm 5 0 \%$ , $\pm 7 5 \%$ , $\pm 1 0 0 \%$ of the cutoff and was collected using the collection devices. The spiked concentrations were confirmed by mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) before collection. The study established the repeatability of the testing system, including assay and oral fluid collection device. Test results in qualitative and semi-quantitative modes are presented in Tables 1 to 6.

An additional 20-day study was performed on 3 lots of assay reagent to demonstrate the repeatability across multiple reagent lots.

# 2. Specificity and Cross-Reactivity

Structurally and functionally similar compounds were spiked into drug free pooled oral fluid at levels that will yield a result that is equivalent to the cutoff, if cross reacting. The study verified the cross reactivity of the methamphetamine assay to related drugs and drug metabolites, in both the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. Cross-reactivity test results in qualitative mode are presented in Table 7. Cross-reactivity test results in semi-quantitative mode are presented in Table 8.

# 4. Interference – Endogenous Compounds and Exogenous Compounds

Endogenous compounds and exogenous compounds were evaluated in qualitative and semi-quantitative modes by spiking the potential interferent into drug free oral fluid containing methamphetamine at $\pm 2 5 \%$ of the cutoff. Additional orally used products were tested by collecting oral fluid using Quantisal and Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Devices from volunteers after use of the substances. At the levels tested, there was no interference observed with endogenous compounds, exogenous compounds and orally used compounds. Endogenous compounds and exogenous compounds are presented in Tables 10 and 11. Orally used compounds tested are presented in Table 12.

# 5. Interference – pH

To evaluate potential interference from the effect of oral fluid $\mathsf { p H }$ , device performance in the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes was tested using a range of oral fluid $\mathsf { p H }$ values (3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0 and 11.0). All test samples were prepared in drug free oral fluid containing methamphetamine at $\pm 2 5 \%$ of the cutoff. At the $\mathsf { p H }$ levels tested, there was no interference observed for each test mode.

# 6. Linearity/Recovery

Assay linearity was evaluated in the semi-quantitative mode by spiking a drug free oral fluid pool with a high concentration of methamphetamine. Additional pools were made by serially diluting the high concentration specimen with drug free oral fluid to achieve concentrations ranging from $2 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ to

$2 2 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . The $0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ specimen was made from drug free oral fluid. Each pool was collected by Quantisal and Quantisal II oral fluid collection devices and tested in triplicate to calculate the mean concentration values that were used to calculate drug recovery. Linearity test results in semi-quantitative mode are presented in Tables 13 to 15. The study confirmed the linear range to be $2 0 { - } 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ with a drug recovery percentage of $9 3 . 9 \%$ to $1 0 9 . 2 \%$ across the collection devices.

# 7. Methamphetamine Stability in Oral Fluid

Drug free negative oral fluid spiked with methamphetamine at $+ 5 0 \%$ of the $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ cutoff were collected and stored in Quantisal and Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Devices at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } $ , tested by LC-MS/MS at each time point and compared to the baseline concentration result. The test results indicate that oral fluid samples containing methamphetamine are stable for up to 12 months stored in Quantisal or Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Device at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Data to support 10-day storage in Quantisal or Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Device at ambient temperature $8 ^ { \circ } C - 2 5 ^ { \circ } C$ were reported in K183048 and K200801.

# 8. Calibration Duration

Drug free negative oral fluid spiked with methamphetamine at $\pm 2 5 \%$ of the cutoff were tested in qualitative mode at time points up to 14 days and in semi-quantitative at time points up to 10 days. At the initial time point, a two-point calibration curve was established in qualitative mode and multi-points calibration curve was established in semi-quantitative mode. These calibrations were used through the duration of the study. The test results met acceptance criteria up to 10 days. The recommended frequency of calibration is 7 days.

# 9. Method Comparison

80 deidentified, unaltered clinical oral fluid samples collected by Quantisal and Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Devices were obtained from clinical research facilities, analyzed for methamphetamine at assay cutoff with the SEFRIA Methamphetamine Oral Fluid Enzyme Immunoassay in both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes and compared to Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) results. The instruments used were the Beckman Coulter AU480 chemistry analyzer and an Agilent 6430 Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry. The data demonstrate that the design goal of greater than $9 5 \%$ agreement was achieved. Method comparison test results in qualitative and semi-quantitative modes are presented from Tables 16 to 18.
