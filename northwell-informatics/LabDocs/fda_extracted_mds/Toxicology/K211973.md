Device Name DRI Cocaine Metabolite Assay

Indications for Use (Describe)

The Alinity c Cocaine assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay intended for the qualitative and/or semi-quantitative determination of benzoylecgonine (Cocaine Metabolite) in human urine at a cutoff concentration of either $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ or $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ on the Alinity c analyzer.

The semiquantitative application is for the purpose of enabling laboratories to determine an appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LCMS/MS) or permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.

The assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid Chromatography/ Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) are the preferred confirmatory method. Tests for cocaine metabolite cannot distinguish between abused drugs and certain prescribed medications.

Clinical and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary results are used. For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only.

# C. Description of Device

The DRI Cocaine Metabolite Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay using ready-touse liquid reagents. The assay uses a specific antibody, which can detect benzoylecgonine in urine. The assay is based on the competition of an enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) labeled drug and the drug from the urine samplefor a fixed amount of specific antibody binding sites. In the presence of free drug from the sample, the free drug occupies the antibody binding sites, allowing the drug-labeled G6PDH to interact with the substrate, resulting in enzyme activity. In the absence of drug from the sample, the specific antibody binds to the drug labeled with G6PDH and the enzyme activity is inhibited. This phenomenon creates a direct relationship between the drug concentration in the urine and the enzyme activity. The enzyme G6PDH activity is determined spectrophotometrically at $3 4 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ by measuring its ability to convert nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH.

The assay consists of reagents (A and E).

Reagent A: Contains mouse monoclonal anti-benzoylecgonine antibody, glucose-6- phosphate (G6P), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in Tris buffer with sodium azide as preservative.

Reagent E: Contains benzoylecgonine analog labeled with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in HEPES buffer with sodium azide as preservative.

The assay is based on the competition of an enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) labeled drug and the drug from the urine sample for a fixed amount of specific antibody binding sites. In the presence of free drug from the sample, the free drug occupies the antibody binding sites, allowingthe drug-labeled G6PDH to interact with the substrate, resulting in enzyme activity. In the absence of drug from the sample, the specific antibody binds to the drug labeled with G6PDH and the enzyme activity is inhibited. This phenomenon creates a direct relationship between the drug concentration in the urine and the enzyme activity. The enzyme G6PDH activity is determined spectrophotometrically at $3 4 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ by measuring its ability to convert nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH.

# c) Analytical Recovery and Linearity

Linearity studies were performed in accordance with CLSI Guideline EP06-A. To demonstrate the dilution linearity for purposes of sample dilution and quality control of the entire assay range, drug free urine was spiked to the high level calibrator using Benzoylecgonine (Cocaine Metabolite) $\mathrm { 1 0 0 0 n g / m L ) }$ and diluted with drug free urine to generate 9 intermediate levels.

Each sample was run in replicates of five in semi-quantitative mode and the average was used to determine percent recovery compared to the expected target value. The percent recovery is summarized in the table below:

# f) Interference

The interference studies were performed in accordance with CLSI Guideline EP07- A3, using both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. The potential interference of pH, endogenous and exogenous physiologic substances on recovery of Benzoylecgonine using DRI Cocaine Metabolite Assay was assessed by spiking known compounds of potentially interfering substances into the low control, $1 1 2 . 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $( - 2 5 \%$ of the cutoff concentration of $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $2 2 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ $( - 2 5 \%$ of the cutoff concentration of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L ) }$ and high control, $1 8 7 . 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $( + 2 5 \%$ of the cutoff concentration of $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ) and $3 7 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $42 5 \%$ of the cutoff concentration of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ). In the presence of the compounds listed below, the controls were detected accurately, indicating that these compounds did not show interference in the assay.

# g) Specific Gravity

Drug free urine samples with specific gravity ranging in value within 1.004 to 1.029 were split and spiked with Benzoylecgonine to a final concentration of either $1 1 2 . 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ or $2 2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (the low control concentrations) or $1 8 7 . 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ or $3 7 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ (high control concentrations). These samples were then evaluated in both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. The controls were detected accurately, indicating that no interference was observed.
