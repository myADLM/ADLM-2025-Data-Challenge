Dear Karena Shaw:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR

803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safety-reportingcombination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531- 542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice (https://www.fda.gov/medical  
devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance) and CDRH Learn   
(https://www.fda.gov/training-and-continuing-education/cdrh-learn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic. See the DICE website (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatoryassistance/contact-us-division-industry-and-consumer-education-dice) for more information or contact DICE by email (DICE@fda.hhs.gov) or phone (1-800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100).

Device Name Evidence MultiSTAT Urine DOA MultiPlex

Indications for Use (Describe)

The Evidence MultiSTAT DOA Urine MultiPlex is intended for use with the Evidence MultiSTAT. The Evidence MultiSTAT is an analyzer intended for the qualitative determination of parent drug molecule and metabolites of drugs in human urine at the associated cutoffs.

The Evidence MultiSTAT DOA Urine MultiPlex detects the following drugs at the following cut-offs:

Analyte   
Phenobarbital   
Tramadol   
Phencyclidine   
Buprenorphine   
6-Acetylmorphine

Cut-Off   
200 ng/ml   
200 ng/ml   
25 ng/ml   
5 ng/ml   
10 ng/ml

The Evidence MultiSTAT DOA Urine MultiPlex provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and/or Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) are the preferred confirmatory methods. Other chemical confirmation methods are available. Clinical consideration and professional judgement should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are obtained.

For in vitro diagnostic use only.

This section applies only to requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.

4.1 The Evidence MultiSTAT analyzer is a benchtop fully automated Biochip Array System. It performs simultaneous detection of multiple analytes from a single sample. The core technology is the Randox Biochip, a solid-state device containing an array of discrete test regions containing immobilized antibodies specific to different Drugs of Abuse (DOA) compound classes. A competitive chemiluminescent immunoassay is used for the DOA assays with the drug in the specimen and drug labelled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) being in direct competition for the antibody binding sites. Increased levels of drug in a specimen will lead to reduced binding of drug labelled with HRP and thus a reduction in chemiluminescence being emitted. The light signal generated from each of the test regions on the biochip is detected by a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera in the Evidence MultiSTAT system which, together with the analyzer software, is used to quantify the light output and produce meaningful results.

The immunoassay processes are performed automatically in a self-contained and sealed biochip cartridge, which holds the biochips, the reagents, wash buffer and other fluids required for the test to be conducted.

Evidence MultiSTAT assays employ a qualitative reporting method. Each test sample is assayed against the provided Cut Off material of known concentration, which is used to determine the classification of the samples based on the comparison of the signal output.

4.2 The Evidence MultiSTAT DOA Urine MultiPlex uses Randox Biochip Technology and performs simultaneous detection of multiple analytes from a single sample, using the Evidence MultiSTAT analyzer. The assays are diagnostic tests for qualitative determination of the parent molecule and metabolites of drugs in human urine. The qualitative tests are based on a cut off value for each analyte, as detailed in the table below.
