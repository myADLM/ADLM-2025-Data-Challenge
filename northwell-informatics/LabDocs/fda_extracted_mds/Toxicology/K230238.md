# 9. Test Principle

The BIOEASY™ U-Catch MAX Multi-Drug Test Cup tests are rapid tests for the qualitative detection of target drug or drug metabolites in urine samples. The tests are lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays. During testing, a urine specimen migrates upward by capillary action. If target drugs present in the urine specimen are below the cut-off concentration, it will not saturate the binding sites of its specific monoclonal mouse antibody coated on the particles. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate and a visible colored line will show up in the test line region. The colored line will not form in the test line region if the target drug level exceeds its cutoff-concentration because it will saturate all the binding sites of the antibody coated on the particles. A band should form in the control region of the devices regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite in the sample to indicate that the tests have been performed properly.

10.Performance Characteristics

1. Analytical Performance

a. Precision

Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of $- 1 0 0 \%$ cut off, - $7 5 \%$ cut off, $- 5 0 \%$ cut off, $- 2 5 \%$ cut off, cut off, $+ 2 5 \%$ cut off, $+ 5 0 \%$ cut off , $+ 7 5 \%$ cut off and $+ 1 0 0 \%$ cut off. These samples were prepared by spiking drug in negative urine samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by LC/MS. All sample aliquots were blindly labeled by the person who prepared the samples and didn’t take part in the sample testing. For each concentration, tests were performed two runs per day for 25 days per device in a randomized order. The results obtained are summarized in the following tables for Amphetamine 500, Cocaine 150, Methamphetamine 500, 2- ethylidene-1, 5-dimethyl-3, 3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), and 6-acetylmorphine (6- AM). The data for Buprenorphine, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Secobarbital, Oxazepam, Morphine, Methadone, Oxycodone, Phencyclidine, d-Propoxyphene,

Nortriptyline and Cannabinoids were reported in k182530.

f. Effect of Urine Specific Gravity and Urine pH

To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine $\mathsf { p H }$ , urine samples, with 1.000 to 1.035 specific gravity or urine samples with $\mathrm { p H } 4$ to 9 were spiked with target drugs at $2 5 \%$ below and $2 5 \%$ above Cut-Off levels. These samples were tested using three lots of each device. Results were all positive for samples at and above $+ 2 5 \%$ Cut-Off and all negative for samples at and below $- 2 5 \%$ Cut-Off.

# 2. Comparison Studies

Method comparison studies for the BIOEASY™ U-Catch MAX Multi-Drug Test Cup were performed in-house with three laboratory assistants. Operators ran 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered clinical samples for each drug. The samples were blind labeled and compared to LC/MS results. The results are presented in the tables below for Amphetamine 500, Cocaine 150, Methamphetamine 500, 2-ethylidene-1, 5-dimethyl-3, 3- diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), and 6-acetylmorphine (6-AM). The data for Buprenorphine, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Secobarbital, Oxazepam, Morphine, Methadone, Oxycodone, Phencyclidine, d-Propoxyphene, Nortriptyline and Cannabinoids were reported in k182530.

Lay-user study

A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 140 lay persons. The lay users had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 20 to $> 5 0$ years. Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations; negative, $+ / - 7 5 \% , + / - 5 0 \% , + / - 2 5 \%$ of the cutoff by spiking drugs into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by LC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers and blind-labeled. Each participant was provided with the package insert, 1 blind labeled sample and a device. Each device was tested. Results are shown below.
