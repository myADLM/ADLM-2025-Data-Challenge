Dear Hong Feng:

We have reviewed your section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database available at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Your device is also subject to, among other requirements, the Quality System (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820), which includes, but is not limited to, 21 CFR 820.30, Design controls; 21 CFR 820.90, Nonconforming product; and 21 CFR 820.100, Corrective and preventive action. Please note that regardless of whether a change requires premarket review, the QS regulation requires device manufacturers to review and approve changes to device design and production (21 CFR 820.30 and 21 CFR 820.70) and document changes and approvals in the device master record (21 CFR 820.181).

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR Part 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR Part 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safetyreporting-combination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR Part 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR Parts 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

Device Name Rapid Fentanyl (FYL) Test Strip Rapid Fentanyl (FYL) Test Dipcard

The Rapid Fentanyl (FYL) Test Strip is a rapid, screening test for the qualitative detection of Fentanyl (FYL) in human urine at the cut-off concentration of $1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

The tests is intended for in vitro diagnostics use. It is intended for prescription use including point of care sites. This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. To obtain a confirmed analytical result, a more specific alternative chemical method must be used. Gas Chromatography/ Mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid chromatography/Mass spectrometry (LC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.

The tests can be performed without the use of an instrument. Test Strip and Test Dipcard use identical test strips made with same chemical formulation and manufacturing procedures.

# 6. Intended Use of Device

The Rapid Fentanyl (FYL) Test Strip is a rapid, screening test for the qualitative detection of Fentanyl (FYL) in human urine at the cut-off concentration of $1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

The tests is intended for in vitro diagnostics use. It is intended for prescription use including point of care sites. This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. To obtain a confirmed analytical result, a more specific alternative chemical method must be used. Gas Chromatography/ Mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid chromatography/Mass spectrometry (LC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method.

# 8. Performance Data:

# 8.1 Cross-reactivity with structurally similar compounds

To test the cross reactivity of the test, 3 lots of test Strip and test Dipcard was used to test with drug metabolites and drug structurally similar compounds in urine. All the components were added to drug-free normal human urine. Each sample was tested in 3 replicates using 3 lots of Strip and test Dipcard. If any positive result was observed, the compounds were further diluted with known drug-free urine specimen sequentially to different concentrations and tested in quintuplicate, until the highest concentration that generates a negative result was identified. The cross reacting substances with the lowest concentration that produced a positive result was identified and is listed in the table below.

# 8.3 Effect of urinary pH

# Co-Innovation Biotech Co.,Ltd.

The $\mathsf { p H }$ of an aliquot negative urine pool is adjusted to a $\mathsf { p H }$ range of 3 to 9 in $1 \ \mathrm { p H }$ unit increments and spiked with target fentanyl at $50 \%$ below and $50 \%$ above cutoff levels. Each sample was tested by 3 lots of test Strip and test Dipcard. The results demonstrate that varying ranges of pH do not interfere with the performance of the test.

# 8.4 Effect of Urinary specific gravity

The specific gravity studies were conducted on different specific gravity including 1.000,1.010, 1.020, 1.030, 1.040 specimens and spiked with target drug fentanyl with concentrations at $50 \%$ below and $50 \%$ above Cut-Off levels. Each sample was tested by 3 lots of test Strip and test Dipcard. The results demonstrate that varying ranges of urinary specific gravity do not affect the test result.

# 8.5 Precision

Precision studies were performed using 3 lots of test Strip and test Dipcard. Drug free specimens were spiked with target drug fentanyl at 0, $\pm 7 5 \%$ cutoff, $\pm 5 0 \%$ cutoff, $\pm 2 5 \%$ cutoff and $+ 1 0 0 \%$ cutoff of drug. The concentrations of the target drugs were confirmed with LC/MS. Each concentration of the urine specimen was divided into aliquots. Each aliquot was blindly labeled by a nonparticipant. Separate sets of blinded coded samples were assigned and randomized prior to testing. The study was conducted by 6 operators at 3 Point-of-Care sites. Two operators per location tested 3 aliquots at each concentration for each lot per day (3 runs/day) for 10 non-consecutive days using one device lot per location. One operator tested the test strip format and the second operator tested the test dipcard format. There were 1620 observations by 3 sites at 9 concentrations.

# 8.6 Accuracy

80 clinical urine specimens were analyzed by LC/MS and by 3 lots of Rapid Fentanyl (FYL) Test Strip and Rapid Fentanyl (FYL) Test Dipcard. Samples were divided by concentration into five categories: drug free, less than half the cutoff, near cutoff negative, near cutoff positive, and high positive. Results were as follows:
