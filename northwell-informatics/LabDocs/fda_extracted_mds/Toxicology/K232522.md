ARK Diagnostics, Inc. – 510(k) Summary, Rev. 0 ARK Levetiracetam II Assay

# 807.92 (a)(4): Device Description

The ARK Levetiracetam II Assay is a homogeneous immunoassay based on competition between drug in the specimen and levetiracetam labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for binding to the antibody reagent. As the latter binds antibody, enzyme activity decreases. In the presence of drug from the specimen, enzyme activity increases and is directly related to the drug concentration. Active enzyme converts the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH that is measured spectrophotometrically as a rate of change in absorbance. Endogenous serum G6PDH does not interfere with the results because the coenzyme NAD functions only with the bacterial enzyme used in the assay.

The ARK Levetiracetam II Assay consists of reagents R1 anti-levetiracetam monoclonal antibody with substrate and R2 levetiracetam labeled with bacterial G6PDH enzyme.

# 807.92 (a)(5): Intended Use / Indications for Use

ARK Levetiracetam II Assay

The ARK Levetiracetam II Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay intended for the quantitative determination of levetiracetam in human serum or plasma on automated clinical chemistry analyzers. Levetiracetam concentrations can be used as an aid in management of patients treated with levetiracetam.

# 807.92 (b)(1) and 807.92 (b)(2): Brief Description of Nonclinical and Clinical Data

The following performance characteristics were obtained on the Beckman Coulter AU680 automated clinical chemistry analyzer.

# Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)

The LoQ of the ARK Levetiracetam II Assay was determined to be $2 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ and may depend on analyzer specific performance. The LoQ was determined according to CLSI EP17-A2 and is defined as the lowest concentration for which acceptable inter-assay precision $( \leq 2 0 \%$ CV) and recovery $( \pm 1 5 \% )$ is observed. Pooled human serum was supplemented with levetiracetam to give concentrations of 1.0, 2.0, and $3 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . Eight (8) replicates of each sample were tested in each of five (5) runs to give a minimum of 40 replicates of each LoQ sample tested.

# Measurement Range

The measurement range of the ARK Levetiracetam II Assay is $2 . 0 - 1 0 0 . 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

# Recovery

Analytical recovery throughout the measurement range was performed by adding concentrated levetiracetam drug into human serum negative for levetiracetam. A stock concentrate of highly pure levetiracetam was added volumetrically to human serum negative for levetiracetam, representing drug concentrations across the assay range. Two analytical runs of three replicates of each sample were assayed on an automated clinical chemistry analyzer. The results of the six replicates of each sample were averaged and compared to the target concentration and percent recovery calculated. Recovery at all concentrations tested was $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the expected sample concentration.

# Linearity

Linearity studies were performed as suggested in CLSI Protocol EP06-Ed2. A $1 2 0 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ levetiracetam serum sample was prepared, and dilutions were made proportionally with human serum negative for levetiracetam. Levetiracetam concentrations ranged from 2.0 to $1 0 0 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . Two analytical runs of three replicates of each sample were assayed on an automated clinical chemistry analyzer. The results of the six replicates of each sample were averaged. A weighted linear regression analysis was performed. Linearity was acceptable if the percent difference $( \%$ Deviation) was $\pm 1 0 \%$ between the predicted results and the observed results. The regression equation calculated according to EP06-Ed2 is $\mathbf { y } { = } 1 . 0 0 3 \mathbf { x }$ . A linear relationship was demonstrated between 2.0 to $1 0 0 . 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

# Precision

Precision was determined as described in CLSI Protocol EP05-A3. Tri-level controls and three samples of levetiracetam in pooled human serum were used in the study. Data were collected on a single analyzer over twenty (20) non-consecutive days. Each level was assayed in quadruplicate twice a day. Each of the runs per day was separated by at least two hours. The within run, between day, total SD, and percent CVs were calculated. Results are shown below. Acceptance criteria: $\leq 1 0 \%$ total CV.

Interference studies were conducted using CLSI EP07-A3 as a guideline. Clinically high concentrations of the following potentially interfering substances in serum with known levels of levetiracetam (approximately 15 and $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ ) were evaluated. Two analytical runs of three replicates of each sample (6 replicates total) were assayed using the ARK Levetiracetam II Assay, along with a serum control of levetiracetam. The mean results of levetiracetam were calculated and the percentage recovery relative to the serum control mean result was determined. Measurement of levetiracetam resulted in $\leq 1 0 \%$ error in the presence of interfering substances at the levels tested.

# Due to structural similarities, brivaracetam (Briviact®) crossreacts substantially in the ARK Levetiracetam II Assay. Measurements of levetiracetam should not be made with the ARK assay when both drugs are present in circulation.

Levetiracetam-selective antibody did not crossreact with other anti-epileptic or coadministered drugs tested. A high concentration of each compound was spiked into normal human serum with known levels of levetiracetam (approximately 15 and $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ ) and assayed along with a serum control of levetiracetam. Measurement of levetiracetam resulted in $\leq 1 0 \%$ error in the presence of drug compounds at the levels tested.
