Dear Jane Zhang:

We have reviewed your section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database available at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Your device is also subject to, among other requirements, the Quality System (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820), which includes, but is not limited to, 21 CFR 820.30, Design controls; 21 CFR 820.90, Nonconforming product; and 21 CFR 820.100, Corrective and preventive action. Please note that regardless of whether a change requires premarket review, the QS regulation requires device manufacturers to review and approve changes to device design and production (21 CFR 820.30 and 21 CFR 820.70) and document changes and approvals in the device master record (21 CFR 820.181).

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR Part 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR Part 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safetyreporting-combination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR Part 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR Parts 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

For comprehensive regulatory information about medical devices and radiation-emitting products, including information about labeling regulations, please see Device Advice (https://www.fda.gov/medical  
devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance) and CDRH Learn   
(https://www.fda.gov/training-and-continuing-education/cdrh-learn). Additionally, you may contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) to ask a question about a specific regulatory topic.

<table><tr><td>Analyte</td><td>Abbreviation</td><td>Calibrator</td><td>Cutoff Concentration (ng/mL)</td></tr><tr><td>Amphetamine</td><td>AMP</td><td>d-Amphetamine</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>Amphetamine</td><td>AMP</td><td>d-Amphetamine</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td>Amphetamine</td><td>AMP</td><td>d-Amphetamine</td><td>1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Barbiturates</td><td>BAR</td><td>Secobarbital/Pentobarbital</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>Barbiturates</td><td>BAR</td><td>Secobarbital/Pentobarbital</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>Benzodiazepines</td><td>BZO</td><td>Oxazepam</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>Benzodiazepines</td><td>BZO</td><td>Oxazepam</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>Buprenorphine</td><td>BUP</td><td>Buprenorphine</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Cocaine</td><td>COC</td><td>Benzoylecgonine</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td>Cocaine</td><td>COC</td><td>Benzoylecgonine</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>Ecstasy</td><td>MDMA</td><td>d,1-Methylenedioxy methamphetamin</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td>Norfentanyl</td><td>FYL</td><td>Norfentanyl</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Methamphetamine</td><td>MET</td><td>d-Methamphetamine</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>Methamphetamine</td><td>MET</td><td>d-Methamphetamine</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td>Methamphetamine</td><td>MET</td><td>d-Methamphetamine</td><td>1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Marijuana</td><td>THC</td><td>11-nor-Δ9-THC-9-COOH</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Methadone</td><td>MTD</td><td>Methadone</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>Morphine</td><td>MOR</td><td>Morphine</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>Opiates</td><td>OPI</td><td>Morphine</td><td>2,000</td></tr><tr><td>Oxycodone</td><td>OXY</td><td>Oxycodone</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Phencyclidine</td><td>PCP</td><td>Phencyclidine</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Propoxyphene</td><td>PPX</td><td>Propoxyphene</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>Tricyclic Antidepressants</td><td>TCA</td><td>Nortriptyline</td><td>1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Tramadol</td><td>TML</td><td>Tramadol</td><td>100</td></tr></table>

The multi test panels can consist of any drug analytes listed above in any combination. Only one cutoff concentration will be included per analyte per device.

The test provides only a preliminary result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed assay result. Gas Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) are the preferred confirmatory methods. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drugs of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.

The tests are not intended to differentiate between drugs of abuse and prescription use of Benzodiazepines, Barbiturates, Buprenorphine, Oxycodone, Propoxyphene and Tricyclic Antidepressants.

# E. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The Chemtrue® Drug Screen Tests are colloidal gold-based lateral flow immunoassays for the rapid, qualitative detection of drugs of abuse in human urine. The tests are single-use, in vitro diagnostic devices, which come in Dip Card or Cup formats, as indicated by the test name.

# G. TEST PRINCIPLE

These devices are rapid lateral flow immunoassays in which chemically modified drugs (drugprotein conjugates) compete with drugs that may be present in urine. On each test strip, a drug-protein conjugate is striped on the test band of the membrane - known as the test region (T) and the anti-drug antibody-colloidal gold conjugate pads are placed at the forward end of the membrane. If target drugs are present in the urine specimen below its cut-off concentration, the solution of the colored antibody-colloidal gold conjugates moves along with the sample solution by capillary action across the membrane to the immobilized drug-protein conjugate zone on the test band region. The colored antibody-gold conjugates then complexes with the drug-protein conjugates to form visible lines. Therefore, the formation of the visible precipitant in the test band indicates a negative result. If the target drug level exceeds its cutoff concentration, the drug/metabolite antigen competes with drug-protein conjugates on the test band region for the limited antibody on the colored drug antibody-colloidal gold conjugate pad. The drug will saturate the limited antibody binding sites and the colored antibodycolloidal gold conjugate cannot bind to the drug-protein conjugate at the test region of the test strip. Therefore, absence of the color band on the test region indicates a preliminary positive result.

A band should form in the control region (C) of the devices regardless of the presence of drug in the sample to indicate that the test has been performed properly.

Monoclonal anti-drug antibodies that are used on the Fentanyl and Tramadol Test devices are derived from mouse.

# H. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS

Performance data of AMP300/500, BAR200, BZO200, COC150, MET300/500 and PPX were presented in the cleared 510(k) k153192 submission. AMP1000, BAR3000, BZO300, BUP10, COC300, MET1000, MOR, PCP, THC, MDMA, MTD, OPI2000, OXY and TCA analytes were previously cleared under k143599 and k142396. In this submission, Fentanyl (FYL) and Tramadol (TML) study data are summarized and presented below:

1. Precision/ Reproducibility Studies:

Precision/reproducibility studies were carried out for Norfentanyl and Tramadol spiked urine controls with LC/MS confirmed concentrations of $0 \%$ , $- 5 0 \%$ , $- 2 5 \%$ , $100 \%$ , $+ 2 5 \%$ and $+ 5 0 \%$ of the drug cut-off. All the aliquots were blindly coded by the research coordinator who prepared the samples and didn’t perform the testing. These blind coded samples were used for FYL5 and TML100 tests in Cup and Dip Card formats in a randomized order. Five (5) replicates at each control level were tested with three (3) lots each device format of FYL and TML Drug Screen Cup/Dip Card Tests by each of the three operators. Each operator tested the blind-labeled samples according to proposed package inserts, record the test results and sign on the data collection form. The study was performed in five (5) consecutive days. The data is analyzed and summarized in the tables below:

CONCLUSION: The usability interference study results demonstrate that no interference or cross reactivity among the 17 drug tests of the Chemtrue® Drug Screen Tests, when testing $50 \%$ of the drug cut off. No false positive result was presented. When testing with $1 5 0 \%$ of the drug cut off urine samples, only the targeted drug tests presented positive results, including the class-drug clinical samples, such as BAR, BZO and TCA that contain multiple drugs in the drug class. No false negative or false positive results were observed.

4. Effect of Urine $\mathsf { p H }$ and Specific Gravity Studies: The testing results demonstrate that the urine pH ranges from 2.0 to 9.0 at $\pm 2 5 \%$ of the drug cut-off concentrations do not affect the test performance. The specific gravity (SG) ranges of 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025 and 1.030 at $\pm 2 5 \%$ of the drug cut-off concentrations do not affect the test results.

5. Stability Study: To establish and support the shelf life and expiration date, stability studies were conducted under accelerated temperature (at $6 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , $5 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and $4 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ ), and real time $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $3 0 \mathrm { { ^ { o } C } }$ ) with three (3) lots of each device format. The stability study results support two (2) years shelf life of the products at ( $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ). The real time stability study is still on going.

To validate robustness of the Chemtrue® Drug Screen FYL/TML Test devices, studies were conducted after the devices (Cup and Dip Card Tests) were exposed to various lighting, humidity and temperature conditions. The results support the robustness of the Chemtrue® Devices.

# 6. Method Comparison (Accuracy) Studies:

Chemtrue® Drug Screen FYL/TML Tests were compared to the LC/MS Reference Method. The accuracy of the Chemtrue® Test devices were evaluated against one hundred and seventy-six (176) clinical urine specimens. Each specimen was confirmed with LC/MS assay with the value assignment. Ninety-three (93) Fentanyl clinical urine specimens and eighty-three (83) Tramadol urine specimens in blind-code label were tested in this correlation study against the LC/MS reference method. Four (4) operators performed the tests. One drug analyst with one set of blind code in one device format - Dip Card / Cup were tested by one operator. Each blind-labeled sample was randomly distributed to each operator for each device format by the Clinical Research Cooperator. The results are summarized in the tables below:

Five (5) discordant results were at or near the norfentanyl drug cutoff level of $5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . One sample (it was tested with one Cup and one Dip Card device to present two test data) with a norfentanyl concentration of $2 . 0 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and Fentanyl concentration of $1 5 . 4 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m l }$ returned a positive result. Further analysis indicated that the cross-reactive level of Fentanyl is $1 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m l }$ . So the positive result could have been caused by the high concentration of Fentanyl in the urine sample.

# 7. OTC Lay-user Accuracy Studies:

One hundred and forty (140) intended lay-users participated in the evaluation for each of the device format (Dip Card and Cup) for OTC accuracy and usability study from three (3) intended user sites (Shopping Mall, School and Hotel) with LC/MS confirmed urine samples. The sample concentrations are consisted of no drug present (0), $50 \%$ , $7 5 \%$ , $12 5 \%$ and $1 5 0 \%$ of the cutoff by spiking drugs into drug-free urine pool. Each sample was aliquot into an individual blind-labeled container. Each lay-user was provided with a package insert in English only and two (2) random blind-coded samples with one each of the device format. The results are summarized in tables below:

The results demonstrate that the agreement between the Chemtrue® Drug Screen FYL/TML test devices and LC/MS assayed values is $100 \%$ .

These lay-users were also given surveys on the ease of understanding the package insert instructions. The results demonstrate that over $9 2 \%$ of the lay users can easily follow the instructions to perform the test and interpret the results. A Flesch-Kincaid reading analysis supports a $7 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ grade reading level.

# I. CONCLUSION:

Based on the test principle and performance characteristics of the device, it is concluded that the Chemtrue® Drug Screen FYL/TML Test devices are substantially equivalent to the predicate.
