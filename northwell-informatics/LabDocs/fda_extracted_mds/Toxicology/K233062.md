Dear Joe Shia:

We have reviewed your section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database available at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Your device is also subject to, among other requirements, the Quality System (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820), which includes, but is not limited to, 21 CFR 820.30, Design controls; 21 CFR 820.90, Nonconforming product; and 21 CFR 820.100, Corrective and preventive action. Please note that regardless of whether a change requires premarket review, the QS regulation requires device manufacturers to review and approve changes to device design and production (21 CFR 820.30 and 21 CFR 820.70) and document changes and approvals in the device master record (21 CFR 820.181).

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR Part 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR Part 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safetyreporting-combination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR Part 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR Parts 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

10. Test Principle

BioSieveTM Multi-Drug Urine Test Panel and BioSieveTM Multi-Drug Urine Test Panel Rx are rapid tests for the qualitative detection of Amphetamine, Buprenorphine, Secobarbital, Oxazepam, Cocaine, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine, Methamphetamine,

Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Morphine, Methadone, Oxycodone, Phencyclidine, Propoxyphene, Nortriptyline and Cannabinoids in urine samples. They are lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay. When urine sample is added to the Panel device, urine is absorbed into the test strip and migrates upwards by capillary action. If the concentration of target drug presented in the urine sample is below the cutoff level, the target drug will not saturate the binding sites of its specific monoclonal antibody-coated particles. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate and a visible colored band will be formed on the test line region. If the concentration of target is beyond the cutoff level, the target drug will saturate the binding sites of its specific monoclonal antibody-particles, thus the antibody-coated particles will not be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate hence no colored band will be formed on the test line region.

A band should be formed on the control line region regardless of the presence of target drug or metabolite in the sample to indicate that the tests have been performed properly.

Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of $- 1 0 0 \%$ cut off, $- 7 5 \%$ cut off, - $50 \%$ cut off, $- 2 5 \%$ cut off, cutoff, $+ 2 5 \%$ cut off, $+ 5 0 \%$ cut off, $+ 7 5 \%$ cut off and $+ 1 0 0 \%$ cut off. Samples with concentration of - $. 1 0 0 \%$ cutoff were drug-free urines samples. Other samples were prepared by spiking target drug in drug-free urine samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by LC/MS. For each concentration, tests were performed two runs per day for 25 days using three lots of test Panels. The results obtained are summarized in the following tables:

e. Specificity

To test the specificity, drug metabolites and other components that are likely to cross-react in urine samples were spiked into drug-free urine. These urine samples were tested using three lots of each device.

Percent cross-reactivity, provided in the below table, was calculated as the cutoff concentration divided by the concentration of analyte tested that yielded a positive result, multiplied by 100; compounds that did not yield a positive result at the highest concentration tested have relative cross reactivity results represented by a dash in the table below:

# f. Effect of Urine Specific Gravity and Urine pH

To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity, urine samples with specific gravity from 1.000 to 1.035 were spiked with target drugs at $+ 2 5 \%$ cutoff and $- 2 5 \%$ cutoff levels. Three Operators tested each sample using test devices from three different lots. The results were all positive for samples at $+ 2 5 \%$ cutoff and all negative for samples at $- 2 5 \%$ cutoff, indicating that urine specific gravity between 1.000 and 1.035 has no effect on the accuracy and precision of the test device.

To investigate the effect of urine $\mathsf { p H }$ , urine samples with pH value from 4 to 9 were spiked with target drugs at $+ 2 5 \%$ cutoff and $- 2 5 \%$ cutoff levels. Three Operators tested each sample using test devices from three different lots. The results were all positive for samples at $+ 2 5 \%$ cutoff and all negative for samples at $- 2 5 \%$ cutoff, indicating that urine $\mathsf { p H }$ value between 4.0 and 9.0 has no effect on the accuracy and precision of the test device.

# g. Reading Time Study

Reading time studies were performed for drug free urine samples and urine samples spiked with drug concentrations of $- 5 0 \%$ cutoff, $- 2 5 \%$ cutoff, $+ 2 5 \%$ cutoff and $+ 5 0 \%$ cutoff. It demonstrated that test results can be read from 5 to 10 minutes.

# 2. Comparison Studies

The method comparison studies for BioSieveTM Multi-Drug Urine Test Panel were performed inhouse with three operators.

Operators ran 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered urine samples. The samples were blind labeled and compared to LC/MS results. The results are presented in the table below:

Lay-user study:

A lay user study was performed using urine samples prepared at the following concentrations; - $1 0 0 \%$ , $+ / - 7 5 \%$ , $+ / { - 5 0 \% }$ , $+ / - 2 5 \%$ of the cutoff by spiking drug(s) into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by LC/MS or LC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers and blind-labeled. A total of 280 participants with diverse educational and professional backgrounds aged 20 years and older were recruited from three sites. Sixty-four males and 76 females tested BioSieveTM Multi-Drug Urine Test Panel Configuration 1 (including AMP 500, MET 500, MOP 300, COC 150); 67 male and 73 females tested BioSieveTM Multi-Drug Urine Test Panel Configuration 2 (including AMP 1000, MET 1000, MOP 2000 (OPI), COC 300). Each participant was provided one package insert, one blind labeled test solution, and one test device. The results are summarized below:
