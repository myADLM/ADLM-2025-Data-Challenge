II Submission/Device Overview:

A Purpose for Submission: New device   
B Measurand: Fractional exhaled nitric oxide   
C Type of Test: Chemical field effect transistor (Chem-FET)

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s): See Indications for Use below.

# B Indication(s) for Use:

Vivatmo pro nitric oxide test is a portable, non-invasive device to measure fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) in human breath.

FeNO is increased in some airway inflammatory processes, such as asthma, and often decreases in response to anti-inflammatory treatment. Measurement of FeNO by Vivatmo pro is a method to measure the decrease in FeNO concentration in asthma patients that often occurs after treatment with anti-inflammatory pharmacological therapy as an indication of therapeutic effect in patients with elevated FeNO levels. FeNO measurements are to be used as an adjunct to established clinical assessments.

Vivatmo pro is suitable for children, approximately 7-17 years, and adults 18 years and older.

Testing using the Vivatmo pro should only be done in a point-of-care healthcare setting under professional supervision. Vivatmo pro should not be used in critical care, emergency care or in anesthesiology.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

Regardless of displayed measured results, monitor signs or symptoms of chest tightness, shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing for decisions about treatment. Do not use the device for subjects suffering from acute upper or lower respiratory infection disease or with current serious medical conditions (other than asthma).

Vivatmo pro should not be used in critical care, emergency care or in anesthesiology. The following conditions can influence correct measurement of results and shall be avoided: smoking or tobacco consumption for at least 1 hour before the measurement, eating or drinking at least 1 hour before the measurement, especially nitrate rich food (e.g., spinach), strenuous exercise, use of rescue inhaler or leukotriene modifier 1h before measurement.

The device is not indicated for children under the age of 7 years of age including infants, or by patients who are unable to understand and execute the instructions given by healthcare providers, as measurement requires patient cooperation.

# D Special Instrument Requirements:

Vivatmo Pro

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The Vivatmo pro device is comprised of the following main components:

1. A Vivatmo pro handheld, which holds the measuring module with electronics, display and the rechargeable battery. The handheld includes software to drive the handheld.

2. A Vivatmo pro basestation, which consists of a cradle to charge the Vivatmo pro handheld and a single board computer to run the Vivatmo pro software driving the touch screen and the interfaces. The basestation is provided with an external power supply.

3. The Vivatmo pro software that runs on the Vivatmo pro basestation.

4. A Vivatmo pro Oxycap, which is a disposable mouthpiece holding filters, desiccant and converter materials to prepare the exhaled breath for the measurement. Vivatmo pro Oxycap is for single use and must be replaced for every new patient and measurement occasion.

5. A Vivatmo pro Level 0 accessory, a disposable mouthpiece with filters, desiccant and reagent to remove NO to facilitate a measurement with 0 ppb FeNO for QC purposes.

# B Principle of Operation:

Vivatmo pro nitric oxide test is a portable, non-invasive device to measure fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) in human breath.

The measurement procedure of the Vivatmo pro generates the fraction of the exhaled breath (FeNO). The last 3 second fraction of a 10 second exhalation is evaluated for average NO concentration. The exhalation flow is controlled to $5 0 \mathrm { m l / s } \pm 5 \mathrm { m l / s }$ at an applied pressure of 10 to $2 0 \thinspace \mathrm { c m } \thinspace \mathrm { H } 2 \mathrm { O }$ .

The measurement method of Vivatmo pro is Chemical field effect transistor (Chem-FET). The measurement sample is internally taken after a bypass time period and directly forwarded onto the sensor. The nitrogen dioxide molecules are adsorbed on the sensor layer and the change in the binding energy creates an electrical signal, which is transferred into a quantifiable measurement signal. The nitrogen dioxide is converted from Nitric oxide in the breath by a potassium permanganate converter in the disposable mouthpiece.

NO2 is measured using Chem-FET detection with NO2 molecules accumulated to a sensitive layer changing the electrical field of the capacitor. The drop of voltage is proportional with the number of NO2 molecules accumulated.

# C Instrument Description Information:

1. Instrument Name: Vivatmo Pro

2. Specimen Identification: The healthcare professional assists the patient, who performs the test in real-time and is identified by patient name

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

The user obtains a breath sample by having the subject exhale into the device.

4. Calibration:

The manufacturer performs calibration for each Vivatmo Pro device. Recalibration by the user is not possible.

5. Quality Control:

QC is recommended weekly or after 50 measurements if Vivatmo pro is used in a clinical environment or point-of-care healthcare setting under professional supervision.
