# II Submission/Device Overview:

A Purpose for Submission: New device   
B Measurand: Fentanyl   
C Type of Test: Qualitative, fluorescence immunoassay (FIA)

# III Intended Use/Indications for Use:

A Intended Use(s):

See Indications for Use below.

B Indication(s) for Use:

BioSieve™ Fentanyl FIA Test Kit is a fluorescence immunoassay (FIA) for the qualitative determination of fentanyl in human urine at a cutoff concentration of $1 . 0 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The assay is intended for use with BioSieve™ ToxiSmart FIA Reader.

It is for in vitro diagnostic use only. It is intended for prescription use.

The tests provide only preliminary results. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) is the preferred confirmatory method.

Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug test result, particularly when the preliminary test result is positive.

BioSieve™ ToxiSmart FIA Reader is a portable fluorescence instrument for in vitro diagnostic use only. The Reader is designed to perform in vitro diagnostic tests on urine specimens. This Reader can be used in a laboratory or in a point-of-care setting.

# C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Rx - For Prescription Use Only

Strips are not for visual read.

# D Special Instrument Requirements:

BioSieve™ ToxiSmart FIA Reader

# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The assay consists of a test strip enclosed in a plastic cassette, a dropper, the BioSieve ToxiSmart FIA Reader, and associated labeling. External quality control materials are recommended but not included.

# B Principle of Operation:

The BioSieve™ Fentanyl FIA Test Kit uses the principle of competitive and fluorescence immunochromatography. The nitrocellulose membrane test area (T) of the test strip is coated with fentanyl-bovine serum albumin conjugate, and the quality control area (C) is coated with goat anti-rabbit lgG polyclonal antibody. Both Fentanyl monoclonal antibody and rabbit lgG polyclonal antibody labeled with fluorescent microspheres are embedded on the conjugate pad. The labeled antibody will flow forward with the sample when the urine sample is applied to the sample well of the test device. When the concentration of fentanyl in the sample is higher than or equal to the cut-off of the product, it will compete with the corresponding conjugate coated on the test area (T) to bind to the fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibody. Thus, fluorescence signal rendering of the test line is inhibited and the result is positive. If the sample does not contain fentanyl or its concentration is lower than the cut-off of the product, the corresponding conjugate on the test line reacts with sufficient fluorescently-labeled monoclonal antibodies. Thus, the test line will develop a fluorescence signal and the result is negative. The quality control area (C) will also develop a fluorescence signal, indicating that the testing has been performed correctly.

# C Instrument Description Information:

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# A Analytical Performance:

# 1. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of - $- 1 0 0 \%$ cutoff, $- 7 5 \%$ cutoff, $- 5 0 \%$ cutoff, $- 2 5 \%$ cutoff, cutoff, $+ 2 5 \%$ cutoff, $+ 5 0 \%$ cutoff, $+ 7 5 \%$ cutoff and $+ 1 0 0 \%$ cutoff for fentanyl cut off concentration of $1 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Samples with concentration of - $100 \%$ cutoff were drug-free urines samples. Other samples were prepared by spiking target drug fentanyl in drug-free urine samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by LC-MS/MS. All sample aliquots were blindly labeled by the person who prepared the samples but didn’t take part in the sample testing. A sequential randomization algorithm was applied to assign the prepared samples to an arbitrary number.

The precision data was collected using three lots of reagent, three analyzers, and three sites, with one replicate per run per lot, with two runs per day collected over 10 days.

Each study site has at least one test operator to perform the test. There are six tests per day per concentration at each site (2 runs per day $\times 3$ lots $\times 9$ concentrations) for a total 54 tests per day per site. Results are summarized in the table below:

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Specificity Using Drug Free Samples:

The sponsor performed a specificity study to demonstrate negative results on drug-free samples using the BioSieve™ Fentanyl FIA Test Kit. In the study, 30 drug-free urine samples were collected. The concentration of these samples were tested and confirmed by LC-MS. The test was performed using three (3) analyzers, three (3) lots and three (3) operators. All tested samples had the expected negative result.

# Cross Reactivity:

The sponsor performed a study to verify potential cross-reactants using the target drug, drug metabolites and other related compounds.

Target drugs, drug metabolites and other components that are likely to interfere in urine samples were added to drug-free urine at different concentrations of compounds and tested using three (3) different instruments, three (3) different lots, and three (3) operators. The lowest concentration that caused a positive result for each compound are listed below.

Percent cross reactivity of a compound is calculated by dividing the cutoff concentration by the minimum concentration required to obtain a positive result and then multiplying by $100 \%$ . The results are listed in the table below:

Interference:

1. Interference Study on the Effect of Specific Gravity and pH:

To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine $\mathsf { p H }$ , urine samples with specific gravity of 1.000 to 1.035 and urine samples with a $\mathsf { p H }$ of 4 to 9, in $1 \ p \mathrm { H }$ unit increments, were spiked with target fentanyl at $50 \%$ below and $50 \%$ above cutoff levels. These samples were tested using three (3) lots of device, three (3) instruments and three (3) different operators. Results were all positive for samples at $+ 5 0 \%$ cutoff and all negative for samples at and below $- 5 0 \%$ cutoff. The results demonstrate that varying ranges of specific gravity and $\mathsf { p H }$ do not interfere with the BioSieve™ Fentanyl Test Kit (FIA).

The data was collected by three operators using three lots and three instruments (one lot per instrument). In all instances the samples at 0.5 and $0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ produced a negative result when run immediately after a sample with a concentration of $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$

# B Comparison Studies:

A comparison study between BioSieve™ Fentanyl Test Kit (FIA) and LC-MS/MS method was conducted in three different testing sites including two POC sites (physician’s offices).

This study was a randomized and blinded accuracy study.

Clinical samples included a total of 80 urine samples (40 Negative and 40 positive). The clinical samples were labeled using randomized numbers by the person who prepares samples and did not perform the actual testing.
