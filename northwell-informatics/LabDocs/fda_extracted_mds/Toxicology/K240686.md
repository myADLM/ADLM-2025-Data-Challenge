# 11. Test Principle

Healgen Accurate Home Urine Drug Test Dip Card or Healgen Accurate Urine Drug Screen Dip Card is a competitive immunoassay that is used to screen for the presence of various drugs and drug metabolites in urine. It is chromatographic absorbent device in which, drugs within a urine sample, competitively combined to a limited number of drug monoclonal antibody (mouse) conjugate binding sites.

When the test is activated, the urine is absorbed into each test strip by capillary action, mixes with the respective drug monoclonal antibody conjugate, and flows across a pre-coated membrane. When drug within the urine sample is below the detection level of the test, respective drug monoclonal antibody conjugate binds to the respective drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the test strip. This produces a colored Test line in the Test Region (T) of the strip, which, regardless of its intensity, indicates a negative test result.

When sample drug levels are at or above the detection level of the test, the free drug in the sample binds to the respective drug monoclonal antibody conjugate, preventing the respective drug monoclonal antibody conjugate from binding to the respective drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device. This prevents the development of a distinct colored band in the test region, indicating a preliminary positive result.

To serve as a procedure control, a colored line will appear at the Control Region (C) of each strip, if the test has been performed properly.

12. Performance Characteristics

# A. Analytical performance

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of $+ 1 0 0 \%$ cutoff, $+ 7 5 \%$ cutoff, $+ 5 0 \%$ cutoff, $+ 2 5 \%$ cutoff, cutoff, $- 2 5 \%$ cutoff, $- 5 0 \%$ cutoff, $- 7 5 \%$ cut off and $- 1 0 0 \%$ cutoff.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable. This device is intended for qualitative use only.

# c. Stability:

The device is stable at $2 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 24 months based on real time stability study.

# d. Analytical specificity/Interference:

To test the specificity, drug metabolites and other components that are likely to cross-react in urine samples were spiked into drug-free urine. These urine samples were tested using three lots of the device.

Percent cross-reactivity, provided in the below table, was calculated as the cutoff concentration divided by the concentration of analyte tested that yielded a positive result, multiplied by 100.

Interference by $\mathsf { p H }$ and specific gravity were also evaluated using pooled urine specimens with concentrations of 0 (drug-free), at $50 \%$ below and $50 \%$ above each corresponding cutoff. The results demonstrated that $\mathsf { p H }$ levels of 4 to 9 and specific gravity levels of 1.000 to 1.035 do not affect the results of the assays.

# B. Method comparison study

The method comparison studies for the device were performed in-house with three operators. Operators ran 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered urine clinical samples for each drug. The samples were blind labeled and compared to LC-MS/MS results. The results are presented in the table below:
