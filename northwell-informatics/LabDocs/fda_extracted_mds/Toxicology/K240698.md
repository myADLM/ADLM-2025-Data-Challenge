Dear Mango Huang:

We have reviewed your section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database available at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

# 11. Test Principle

Dochek $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Multi-Drug Urine Test Dipcard Rx or Dochek $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Multi-Drug Urine Test Dipcard is a competitive immunoassay that is used to screen for the presence of various drugs and drug metabolites in urine. It is chromatographic absorbent device in which, drugs within a urine sample, competitively combined to a limited number of drug monoclonal antibody (mouse) conjugate binding sites.

When the test is activated, the urine is absorbed into each test strip by capillary action, mixes with the respective drug monoclonal antibody conjugate, and flows across a pre-coated membrane. When drug in the urine sample is below the detection level of the test, respective drug monoclonal antibody conjugate binds to the respective drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the test strip. This produces a colored Test line in the Test Region (T) of the strip, which, regardless of its intensity, indicates a negative test result.

When drug level is at or above the detection level of the test, the free drug in the sample binds to the respective drug monoclonal antibody conjugate, preventing the respective drug monoclonal antibody conjugate from binding to the respective drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device. This prevents the development of a distinct colored band in the test region, indicating a preliminary positive result.

To serve as a procedure control, a colored line will appear at the Control Region (C) of each strip, if the test has been performed properly.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable. This device is intended for qualitative use only.

# c. Stability:

The device can be stable at $2 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 36 months based on real time stability study.

# d. Detection limit:

Not applicable.

# e. Analytical specificity/Interference:

# Cross-Reactivity:

Analytical specificity for this device was determined through adding the potential interfering substances to drug-free urine samples. The relative cross-reactivity represents the minimum concentration necessary to yield a result similar to the cutoff level of the respective assay. Percent cross-reactivity, provided in the below table, was calculated as the concentration of analyte tested that yielded a positive result, divided by the cutoff concentration, multiplied by 100. If no cross reactivity was observed, the highest concentration tested is shown.

# Interfering Substances:

To evaluate potential interference, non-structurally related compounds were added to drug-free urine and to urine samples containing the target drugs at $2 5 \%$ below and $2 5 \%$ above each corresponding cutoff. Compounds that show no interference at a concentration of $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ are summarized in the following table.

# Effect of Urinary $\mathbf { p H }$ and Specific Gravity:

Interference by urinary $\mathsf { p H }$ and specific gravity were also evaluated using pooled urine specimens with concentrations of 0 (drug-free), at $2 5 \%$ below and $2 5 \%$ above each corresponding cutoff. The results demonstrated that $\mathsf { p H }$ levels of 4 to 9 and specific gravity levels of 1.000 to 1.035 do not affect the results of the assays.

# B. Method Comparison Study

The method comparison studies for the device were performed in-house with three operators.

Operators ran 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered urine clinical samples for each drug. The samples were blind labeled and compared to LC-MS/MS results. The results are presented in the table below:
