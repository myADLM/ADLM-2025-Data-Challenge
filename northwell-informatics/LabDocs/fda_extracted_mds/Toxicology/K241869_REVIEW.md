# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

The test system consists of a test strip enclosed in a plastic cassette (the test device), a dropper, the BioSieve™ Toxismart Reader, and associated labeling. External quality control materials are recommended but not included. The test device is the same physical device as was cleared in k240124.

# B Principle of Operation:

The BioSieve™ Fentanyl FIA Test Kit uses the principle of competitive and fluorescence immunochromatography. The nitrocellulose membrane test area (T) of the test strip is coated with fentanyl-bovine serum albumin conjugate, and the quality control area (C) is coated with goat anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody. Both Fentanyl monoclonal antibody and rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody labeled with fluorescent microspheres are embedded on the conjugate pad. The labeled antibody will flow forward with the sample when the urine sample is applied to the sample well of the test device. When the concentration of fentanyl in the sample is higher than or equal to the cut-off of the product, it will compete with the corresponding conjugate coated on the test area (T) to bind to the fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibody. Thus, fluorescence signal rendering of the test line is inhibited, and the result is positive. If the sample does not contain fentanyl or its concentration is lower than the cut-off of the product, the corresponding conjugate on the test line reacts with sufficient fluorescently-labeled monoclonal antibodies. Thus, the test line will develop a fluorescence signal and the result is negative. The quality control area (C) will also develop a fluorescence signal, indicating that the testing has been performed correctly.

Lay-users were also given a questionnaire on the ease of understanding the package insert instructions. All lay users indicated that the device instructions can be easily followed. A Flesch-Kincaid reading analysis was performed on the package insert and the score revealed a reading grade level of less than 8.

2) Effect of Temperature and Humidity:

A study was conducted to investigate the effect of using a test device outside of the temperature and humidity operating conditions. The product labeling instructs the operator to allow the test device to reach operating temperature $6 4 . 4 \mathrm { - } 7 7 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { F }$ , $1 8 \mathrm { - } 2 5 ^ { \mathrm { { o } C } }$ prior to use. The claimed humidity operating range for the system is 10 to $90 \%$ RH. Temperatures ranging from $4 5 { - } 1 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ $7 . 2 { - } 4 3 . 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and relative humidity from $10 { - } 9 0 \%$ were tested. Each drug concentration was confirmed by LC-MS/MS. The following conditions were tested:

Condition 1: ambient condition ( $2 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and $50 \%$ RH) Condition 2: excessive temperature $( 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and humidity’s of $5 \%$ RH Condition 3: excessive temperature $( 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and humidity’s of $9 5 \%$ RH

Condition 4: stored in the refrigerator, $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 1 hour. The test devices were run immediately after taking out of the refrigerator.   
Condition 5: low temperature $( 7 . 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $5 \%$ RH   
Condition 6: low temperature $( 7 . 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $9 5 \%$ RH

Samples with concentrations of - $100 \%$ cutoff, $- 5 0 \%$ cutoff and $+ 5 0 \%$ cutoff for fentanyl cutoff concentration of $1 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ were tested. 3 lots of test devices and 3 readers were used for testing. All samples generated expected results, indicating that the test device is tolerant to inappropriate temperature and humidity.

# 3) Effect of Vibration:

A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of vibrations produced by nearby laboratory equipment on the performance of the fentanyl test device when run on the analyzer. Test devices were prepared with samples at with concentrations of - $100 \%$ cutoff, $- 5 0 \%$ cutoff and $+ 5 0 \%$ cutoff. 3 lots of cartridges and 3 analyzers were used for testing. Samples were tested at ambient temperature, placed in close proximity (within 1 foot) to a centrifuge running at $9 { , } 5 0 0 \mathrm { r p m }$ or to a centrifuge running at $1 5 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { r p m }$ . All samples generated expected results, indicating that the device is tolerant to vibrations coming from a centrifuge at the rpm tested.

4) Effect of Time Lapse:

A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of time lapse between applying the sample on the test device and inserting the test device into the reader. The product labeling instructs that during the test procedure, insert the sample-added test device into the slot of BioSieve™ Toxismart Reader immediately. The testing was performed by evaluating time lapse from 0 to 3 minutes (i.e., 0, 1, 2, and 3 minutes). Samples with concentrations of - $- 1 0 0 \%$ cutoff, $- 5 0 \%$ cutoff and $+ 5 0 \%$ cutoff were tested. 3 lots of test devices and 3 readers were used for testing. All samples generated expected results, indicating that that the test device is tolerant to inappropriate time lapse between applying the sample on the test device and inserting the test device into the reader.

# 5) Effect of Drop

A was conducted to evaluate the potential of the invisible damage to the test device when inadvertently dropped or knocked over during the procedure both before and after sample addition to the device.

Condition 1: reader plus test device were dropped from the test height (6.5 foot, 2 meters) onto the floor prior to sample addition. After dropping, samples were added, and each test device was tested. Condition 2: reader plus test device were dropped from the test height (6.5 foot, 2 meters) onto the floor after sample addition. After dropping, each device was tested.

Samples with concentrations of - $- 1 0 0 \%$ cutoff, $- 5 0 \%$ cutoff and $+ 5 0 \%$ cutoff were tested. 3 lots of test devices and 3 readers were used for testing. All samples generated expected results, indicating that the test device is tolerant to drop of 6.5 feet (higher than the normal expected height when an operator drops a test device).

# 6) Effect of Sample Volume:

The study was conducted to investigate the effect of adding insufficient or excess number of drops from the specimen collection container into the sample well. The product labeling instructs that during the test procedure, user should add three drops $( \sim 7 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { L } )$ of the sample to the sample well of the test device using the Dropper. The testing was

performed by evaluating number of drops from $0 . 6 7 \mathrm { x }$ to $1 . 6 7 \mathrm { x }$ the nominal volume (i.e., 2, 3, 4, and 5 drops of sample). Samples with concentrations of - $- 1 0 0 \%$ cutoff, $- 5 0 \%$ cutoff and $+ 5 0 \%$ cutoff were tested. 3 lots of test devices and 3 readers were used for testing. All samples generated expected results, indicating that the test device is tolerant to incorrect sample addition to the sample well.

7) Effect of Using Expired Test Devices:

A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of using expired test devices. Three lots of expired cassettes (different expiration dates) were used in this study. Results support that the test device yields an error code when expired cassettes are used.

8) Effect of Analyzer Assembly Held at an Angle While Reading Results:

A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of placing the assembled fentanyl test device in holder with the analyzer at different angle facing the operator reading of the results. Test devices were prepared with sample (with concentrations of - $1 0 0 \%$ cutoff, - $50 \%$ cutoff and $+ 5 0 \%$ cutoff) and tested at different angle of from 15-90 degrees (i.e., 15, 30, 45, 60,75 and 90 degree). 3 lots of test devices and 3 readers were used for testing. All samples generated expected results, indicating that holding the analyzer assembly at an angle while reading results has no impact on the performance.

9) Effect of Incorrect Orientation of Test Device in Holder:

A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of incorrect orientation of the test device the holder on reading the results by the Analyzer. Three incorrect orientations were tes with respect to the correct orientation of the test device in the holder:

Condition 1: correct orientation Condition 2: upside down from the correct orientation Condition $3 \colon 1 8 0 \circ$ rotation from correct orientation Condition 4: 180◦ rotation and upside down from correct orientation

Samples with concentrations of - $- 1 0 0 \%$ cutoff, $- 5 0 \%$ cutoff and $+ 5 0 \%$ cutoff were tested. 3 lots of test devices and 3 readers were used for testing. Results support that when the orientation is incorrect, the test device cannot be scanned.

# 10) Effect of Reader Button Pressed Throughout the Run:

A study was to evaluate the effect of touching the left and/or right reader button by mistake throughout the run (from start of the run to result display). Samples with concentrations of - $. 1 0 0 \%$ cutoff, $- 5 0 \%$ cutoff and $+ 5 0 \%$ cutoff were tested. 3 lots of test devices and 3 readers were used for testing. All samples generated expected results, indicating that pressing of the left and/or right reader button by mistake during the run does not affect the final test results.

# 11) Effect of Environmental Light:

A she study was conducted to evaluate the effect of environmental light (with and without direct sunlight) on reading of test results by BioSieve™ Toxismart Reader. The testing was performed across the following three conditions: (1) indoors with only light and no sunlight; (2) outdoors in direct sunlight and (3) indoors with indirect sunlight. Samples with concentrations of - $- 1 0 0 \%$ cutoff, $- 5 0 \%$ cutoff and $+ 5 0 \%$ cutoff were tested. 3 lots of test devices and 3 readers were used for testing. All samples generated expected results, indicating that the test device is tolerant to different lighting conditions.

12) Cleaning and Disinfection Robustness Evaluation:
