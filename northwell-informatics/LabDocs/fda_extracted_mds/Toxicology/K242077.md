Dear Jenny Xia:

We have reviewed your section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database available at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Additional information about changes that may require a new premarket notification are provided in the FDA guidance documents entitled "Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device" (https://www.fda.gov/media/99812/download) and "Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Software Change to an Existing Device" (https://www.fda.gov/media/99785/download).

Your device is also subject to, among other requirements, the Quality System (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820), which includes, but is not limited to, 21 CFR 820.30, Design controls; 21 CFR 820.90, Nonconforming product; and 21 CFR 820.100, Corrective and preventive action. Please note that regardless of whether a change requires premarket review, the QS regulation requires device manufacturers to review and approve changes to device design and production (21 CFR 820.30 and 21 CFR 820.70) and document changes and approvals in the device master record (21 CFR 820.181).

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR Part 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR Part 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safetyreporting-combination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR Part 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR Parts 1000-1050.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

# 11. Test Principle

PocguideTM Multi-Drug Test Cup OTC or PocguideTM Multi-Drug Test Cup is a competitive immunoassay that is used to screen for the presence of drugs of abuse in urine. It is chromatographic absorbent device in which drugs or drug metabolites in a sample competitively combined to a limited number of antibody-dye conjugate binding sites. When the absorbent end of the test device is immersed into the urine sample, the urine is absorbed into the device by capillary action, mixes with the antibody-dye conjugate, and flows across the precoated membrane.

When sample drug levels are at or above the target cutoff (the detection sensitivity of the test), the drug in the sample binds to the antibody-dye conjugate preventing the antibody-dye conjugate from binding to the drug-protein pre-coated in the test region (T). This prevents the development of a distinct colored band in the test region indicating a potentially positive result. When sample drug levels are zero or below the target cutoff, antibody-dye conjugate binds to the drug-protein pre-coated in the test region (T) of the device. This produces a colored test line that, regardless of its intensity, indicates a negative result.

To serve as a procedural control, a colored line will always appear at the control region (C) indicating that proper volume of specimen has been added and membrane wicking has occurred.

# 12. Performance Characteristics

# A. Analytical performance

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of $+ 1 0 0 \%$ cutoff, $+ 7 5 \%$ cutoff, $+ 5 0 \%$ cutoff, $+ 2 5 \%$ cutoff, cutoff, $- 2 5 \%$ cutoff, $- 5 0 \%$ cutoff, $- 7 5 \%$ cut off and $- 1 0 0 \%$ cutoff. Samples with concentration of - $100 \%$ cutoff were drug-free urine samples. Other samples were prepared by spiking target drug in drug-free urine samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by LC-MS/MS. For each concentration, tests were performed two runs per day for 25 days using three lots of test cups. The results obtained are summarized in the following tables:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable. This device is intended for qualitative use only.

# c. Stability:

The device is stable at $4 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 24 months based on accelerated stability study.

# d. Analytical specificity/Interference:

To test the specificity, drug metabolites and other components that are likely to cross-react in urine samples were spiked into drug-free urine. These urine samples were tested using three lots of the device.

Percent cross-reactivity, provided in the below table, was calculated as the cutoff concentration divided by the concentration of analyte tested that yielded a positive result, multiplied by 100.

Interference by $\mathsf { p H }$ and specific gravity were also evaluated using pooled urine specimens with concentrations at $2 5 \%$ below and $2 5 \%$ above each corresponding cutoff. The results demonstrated that $\mathsf { p H }$ levels of 4 to 9 and specific gravity levels of 1.000 to 1.035 do not affect the results of the assays.

# B. Method comparison study

The method comparison studies for the device were performed with three operators. Operators ran 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered urine clinical samples for each drug. The samples were blind labeled and compared to LC-MS/MS results. The results are presented in the table below:

# C. Lay person study

A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 280 lay persons. 114 males and 166 females tested PocguideTM Multi-Drug Test Cup. They had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and their ages ranged from 18 to $> 5 0$ . The 280 lay persons were split into two groups of 140 whereby group 1 tested configuration 1 of the cup and group 2 tested configuration 2 of the cup. Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations: - $100 \%$ , $+ / - 7 5 \%$ , $+ / - 5 0 \%$ , $+ / - 2 5 \%$ of the cutoff by spiking drug(s) into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by LC-MS/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers and blind-labeled. Each participant was provided with the package insert, 1 blind labeled sample, and a device. The results are summarized below.
