Dear Jenny Mao:

We have reviewed your section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database available at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

Additional information about changes that may require a new premarket notification are provided in the FDA guidance documents entitled "Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device" (https://www.fda.gov/media/99812/download) and "Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Software Change to an Existing Device" (https://www.fda.gov/media/99785/download).

Your device is also subject to, among other requirements, the Quality System (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820), which includes, but is not limited to, 21 CFR 820.30, Design controls; 21 CFR 820.90, Nonconforming product; and 21 CFR 820.100, Corrective and preventive action. Please note that regardless of whether a change requires premarket review, the QS regulation requires device manufacturers to review and approve changes to device design and production (21 CFR 820.30 and 21 CFR 820.70) and document changes and approvals in the device master record (21 CFR 820.181).

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR Part 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR Part 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safetyreporting-combination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR Part 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR Parts 1000-1050.

All medical devices, including Class I and unclassified devices and combination product device constituent parts are required to be in compliance with the final Unique Device Identification System rule ("UDI Rule"). The UDI Rule requires, among other things, that a device bear a unique device identifier (UDI) on its label and package (21 CFR 801.20(a)) unless an exception or alternative applies (21 CFR 801.20(b)) and that the dates on the device label be formatted in accordance with 21 CFR 801.18. The UDI Rule (21 CFR 830.300(a) and 830.320(b)) also requires that certain information be submitted to the Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID) (21 CFR Part 830 Subpart E). For additional information on these requirements, please see the UDI System webpage at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-advicecomprehensive-regulatory-assistance/unique-device-identification-system-udi-system.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR 807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21 CFR Part 803), please go to https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-reportingmdr-how-report-medical-device-problems.

# 11. Test Principle

The Fentanyl (FTY) Test System is an immunoassay based on the principle of competitive binding that is used to screen for the presence of Fentanyl in urine. It is a chromatographic absorbent device in which Fentanyl in a sample competitively combined to a limited number of antibody-dye conjugate binding sites.

During testing, the urine specimen migrates upward by capillary action. Fentanyl, if present in the urine specimen below $1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , will not saturate the binding sites of antibody-coated particles in the test device. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized FTY conjugate and a visible colored line will appear in the test region (T) to indicate a negative result. The colored line will not appear in the test region (T) if the Fentanyl level exceeds $1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ because it will saturate all the binding sites of anti-FTY antibodies and prevent the development of a distinct colored line, which indicating a positive result.

To serve as a procedure control, a colored line will always appear at the control region (C), if the test has been performed properly.

12. Performance Characteristics

A. Analytical performance a. Precision/Reproducibility

Precision study was performed using drug-free specimens spiked with Fentanyl at different concentrations: $0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $0 . 2 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $0 . 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $0 . 7 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $1 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $1 . 2 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $1 . 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $1 . 7 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , and $2 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . All concentrations were confirmed with LC-MS/MS. The study was performed 3 runs per day and lasted for 10 non-consecutive days using three different lots of Dochek $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Fentanyl Urine Test Strip, Dochek $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Fentanyl Urine Test Card and Dochek $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Fentanyl Urine Test Cup. 30 determinations were made for each concentration, and a total of 60 results were obtained per concentration per lot (each result was read in duplicate by two different operators).

# C. Lay person study

Lay user studies were performed at three intended user sites with 980 lay persons. They had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 20 to 65 years. Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations: $0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $0 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L } ~ 0 . 5 \mathrm { n g / m L } ,$ , $0 . 7 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $1 . 2 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $1 . 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $1 . 7 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ cutoff by spiking target drug fentanyl into drug free urine specimens. The concentrations of samples were confirmed by

LC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers, blind-labeled and randomized. Each participant was provided with the English package insert, 1 blind labeled sample, and a device. Results were as follows:
