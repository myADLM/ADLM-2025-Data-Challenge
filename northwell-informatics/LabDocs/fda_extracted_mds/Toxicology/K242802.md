9. Test Principle

The CLUNGENE Fentanyl Tests are immunoassays based on the principle of competitive binding.

During testing, a urine specimen migrates upward by capillary action. Fentanyl, if present in the urine specimen below $1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , will not saturate the binding sites of antibody-coated particles in the test device. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized fentanyl conjugate and a visible colored line will show up in the test line region. The colored line will not form in the test line region if the fentanyl level exceeds $1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ because it will saturate all the binding sites of anti-fentanyl antibodies.

To serve as a procedural control, a colored line will always appear at the control line region indicating that proper volume of specimen has been added and membrane wicking has occurred.

10.Performance Characteristics

1. Analytical Performance

a. Precision

Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of $- 1 0 0 \%$ cut off, - $7 5 \%$ cut off, $- 5 0 \%$ cut off, $- 2 5 \%$ cut off, cut off, $+ 2 5 \%$ cut off, $+ 5 0 \%$ cut off, $+ 7 5 \%$ cut off and $+ 1 0 0 \%$ cut off. These samples were prepared by spiking fentanyl in negative samples. Each fentanyl concentration was confirmed by LC/MS. All sample aliquots were blindly labeled by the person who prepared the samples and didn’t take part in the sample testing. For each concentration, tests were performed two tests per lot per day per operator for 10 days in a randomized order.

# f. Effect of Urine Specific Gravity and Urine pH

To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine $\mathsf { p H }$ , urine samples, with 1.000 to 1.035 specific gravity or urine samples with $\mathrm { p H } 4$ to 9 were spiked with target fentanyl at $50 \%$ below and $50 \%$ above Cut-Off levels. These samples were tested using three lots of device. Results were all positive for samples at and above $+ 5 0 \%$ Cut-Off and all negative for samples at and below $- 5 0 \%$ Cut-Off.

# 2. Comparison Studies

Method comparison studies for the CLUNGENE Fentanyl Test were performed by three different operators. Operators ran 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered clinical samples. The samples were blind labeled and compared to LC/MS results. The results are presented in the tables below.

3. Lay-user study

A lay user study was performed at three testing sites representative of intended use settings with 140 lay persons. They had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 19 to ${ > } 5 0$ years. Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations; - $100 \%$ , $+ / - 7 5 \%$ , $+ / - 5 0 \%$ , $+ / - 2 5 \%$ of the cut-off by spiking fentanyl into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by LC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers, blind-labeled and randomized. Each participant was provided with the package insert, 1 blind labeled sample and a device. The results are summarized below:
