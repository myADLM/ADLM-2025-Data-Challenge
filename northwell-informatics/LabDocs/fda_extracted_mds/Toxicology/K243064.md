9. Test Principle

The ETERBIO Fentanyl/Norfentanyl Rapid Test (Colloidal Gold) and ETERBIO Fentanyl/Norfentanyl Home Test are immunoassays based on the principle of competitive binding.

During testing, a urine specimen migrates upward by capillary action. Each target drug, if present in the urine specimen below its cutoff, will not saturate the binding sites of antibodycoated particles in the test device. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug conjugate and a visible colored line will show up in the test line region. The colored line will not form in the test line region if the drug level exceeds the cutoff because it will saturate all the binding sites of anti-drug antibodies.

To serve as a procedural control, a colored line will always appear at the control line region indicating that proper volume of specimen has been added and membrane wicking has occurred.

1. Analytical Performance

a. Precision

Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of $- 1 0 0 \%$ cut off, - $7 5 \%$ cut off, $- 5 0 \%$ cut off, $- 2 5 \%$ cut off, cut off, $+ 2 5 \%$ cut off, $+ 5 0 \%$ cut off, $+ 7 5 \%$ cut off and $+ 1 0 0 \%$ cut off for each target drug. These samples were prepared by spiking fentanyl or norfentanyl in negative urine samples. Each fentanyl or norfentanyl concentration was confirmed by LC/MS. All sample aliquots were blindly labeled by the person who prepared the samples and didn’t take part in the sample testing. For each concentration, tests were performed six tests per day per device lot for 10 days in a randomized order.

# c. Stability

The devices are stable at 36-86F for 24 months based on the real stability study.

# d. Interference

Potential interfering substances found in human urine of physiological or pathological conditions were added to drug-free urine and target drug fentanyl urine with concentrations at $50 \%$ below and $50 \%$ above Cut-Off levels. These urine samples were tested using three batches of each device. Compounds that showed no interference at a concentration of $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ or specified concentrations are summarized in the following tables.
