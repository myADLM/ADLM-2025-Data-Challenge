Dear Jenny Xia:

We have reviewed your section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some cleared products may instead be combination products.

You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR Part 803) for devices or postmarketing safety reporting (21 CFR Part 4, Subpart B) for combination products (see https://www.fda.gov/combination-products/guidance-regulatory-information/postmarketing-safetyreporting-combination-products); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) for devices or current good manufacturing practices (21 CFR Part 4, Subpart A) for combination products; and, if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR Parts 1000-1050.

All medical devices, including Class I and unclassified devices and combination product device constituent parts are required to be in compliance with the final Unique Device Identification System rule ("UDI Rule"). The UDI Rule requires, among other things, that a device bear a unique device identifier (UDI) on its label and package (21 CFR 801.20(a)) unless an exception or alternative applies (21 CFR 801.20(b)) and that the dates on the device label be formatted in accordance with 21 CFR 801.18. The UDI Rule (21 CFR 830.300(a) and 830.320(b)) also requires that certain information be submitted to the Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID) (21 CFR Part 830 Subpart E). For additional information on these requirements, please see the UDI System webpage at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-advicecomprehensive-regulatory-assistance/unique-device-identification-system-udi-system.

Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR 807.97).

# 11. Test Principle

AllTest Multi-Drug Rapid Urine Test Cup or AllTest Multi-Drug Urine Test Cup is a competitive immunoassay that is used to screen for the presence of various drugs and drug metabolites in urine. It is chromatographic absorbent device in which, drugs within a urine sample, competitively combined to a limited number of drug monoclonal antibody (mouse) conjugate binding sites.

When the test is activated, the urine is absorbed into each test strip by capillary action, mixes with the respective drug monoclonal antibody conjugate, and flows across a pre-coated membrane. When drug within the urine sample is below the detection level of the test, respective drug monoclonal antibody conjugate binds to the respective drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the test strip. This produces a colored Test line in the Test Region (T) of the strip, which, regardless of its intensity, indicates a negative test result.

When sample drug levels are at or above the detection level of the test, the free drug in the sample binds to the respective drug monoclonal antibody conjugate, preventing the respective drug monoclonal antibody conjugate from binding to the respective drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device. This prevents the development of a distinct colored band in the test region, indicating a preliminary positive result.

To serve as a procedure control, a colored line will appear at the Control Region (C) of each strip, if the test has been performed properly.

Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of $+ 1 0 0 \%$ cutoff, $+ 7 5 \%$ cutoff, $+ 5 0 \%$ cutoff, $+ 2 5 \%$ cutoff, cutoff, $- 2 5 \%$ cutoff, $- 5 0 \%$ cutoff, $- 7 5 \%$ cut off and $- 1 0 0 \%$ cutoff. Other samples were prepared by spiked target drug in drug-free urine samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by LC-MS/MS. For each concentration, tests were performed two runs per day for 25 days using three lots of test cups. The results obtained are summarized in the following table for Amphetamine (AMP 1000), Benzoylecgonine (COC 300), Methamphetamine (MET 1000), Morphine (OPI/MOP 2000), 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), Tramadol (TRA), Propoxyphene (PPX) and 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM). The precision for the remaining analytes is supported by data in the previously cleared submission K241428.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable. This device is intended for qualitative use only.

# c. Stability:

The device is stable at $2 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 24 months based on real time stability study.

# d. Analytical specificity/Interference:

To test the specificity, drug metabolites and other components that are likely to cross-react in urine samples were spiked into drug-free urine. These urine samples were tested using three lots of the device. The results obtained are summarized in the following table for Amphetamine (AMP 1000), Benzoylecgonine (COC 300), Methamphetamine (MET 1000), Morphine (OPI/MOP 2000), 2- ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), Tramadol (TRA), Propoxyphene (PPX) and 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM). The specificity for the remaining analytes is supported by data in the previously cleared submission K241428.

Percent cross-reactivity, provided in the below table, was calculated as the cutoff concentration divided by the concentration of analyte tested that yielded a positive result, multiplied by 100.

Interference by $\mathsf { p H }$ and specific gravity were also evaluated using pooled urine specimens with concentrations of 0 (drug-free), at $50 \%$ below and $50 \%$ above each corresponding cutoff. The results demonstrated that $\mathsf { p H }$ levels of 4 to 9 and specific gravity levels of 1.000 to 1.035 do not affect the results of the assays.

# B. Method comparison study

The method comparison studies for the device were performed in-house with three operators. Operators ran 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered urine clinical samples for each drug. The samples were blind labeled and compared to LC-MS/MS results. The results are presented in the table below for Amphetamine (AMP 1000), Benzoylecgonine (COC 300), Methamphetamine (MET 1000), Morphine (OPI/MOP 2000), 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), Tramadol (TRA), Propoxyphene (PPX) and 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM). The method comparison for the remaining analytes is supported by data in the previously cleared submission K241428.

# C. Lay person study

A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 280 lay persons. 117 male and 163 female tested AllTest Multi-Drug Urine Test Cup. They had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and their age range from 20 to $> 5 0$ . Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations; $- 1 0 0 \%$ , $+ / - 7 5 \%$ , $+ / - 5 0 \%$ , $+ / - 2 5 \%$ of the cutoff by spiking drug(s) into drug freepooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by LC-MS/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers and blind-labeled. Each participant was provided with the package insert, 1 blind labeled sample and a device. The results are summarized below.
