The configurations of the One Step Multiple Drugs of Abuse Assays are
available in any combination of the above tests. These devices are intended to
be used by healthcare professionals only. For in vitro diagnostic use.
Measurements obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis and treatment
of use or overdose of the drugs listed above.
This assay provides only a preliminary result. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result,
particularly in evaluating a preliminary positive result. To obtain a confirmed
analytical result, a more specific alternate chemical method is needed. Gas
chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) is the recommended
confirmatory method.

3. Special condition for use statement(s):
The Guangzhou Wondfo assay provides only a preliminary analytical test
result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a
confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/Mass spectrometry is the
preferred confirmatory method. Other chemical confirmation methods are
available. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied
to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results
are used.
The assay is not designated for use in point-of-care settings.
Tests for barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opiates, and tricyclic antidepressants
cannot distinguish between abused drugs and certain prescribed medications.
Certain foods or medications may interfere with tests for amphetamines and
opiates and cause false positive results.
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Not applicable. The devices are visually read single-use devices.
I. Device Description:
The sponsor has included data from three different configurations, all of which use
the same strip(s). One configuration is a single-use dipstick device. Operators dip
the test strip into the urine and the reaction is initiated by movement of the sample
through the test strip. The second configuration combines from 2 to 12 strips in a
multi-drug urine test panel. Operators dip the test strips into the urine and the
reaction is initiated by movement of the sample through the test strips. The third
configuration uses the same strips in a cassette format. Operators add several drops
of the sample to the sample well. The test reaction is initiated by movement of the
sample through the test strip.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
ACON, Inc One Step Drug Screening Test Card
2. Predicate K number(s):
K020771

3. Comparison with predicate:
Both devices are for the qualitative determination of the same analyte(s) in the
same matrix, and utilize the same cutoff concentration. Both are visually-read
single use devices. The reagent formulations vary between the two devices.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
The sponsor did not reference any standards in their submission.
L. Test Principle:
The test employs lateral flow immunochromatographic technology.
Drug in the sample and drug-labeled conjugate (containing a chromagen) compete for
antibody binding sites in the test area of the test strip. Binding of drug in the sample
causes the absence of a line at the test area, i.e., a positive result. When drug is not
present in the sample, the drug-labeled conjugate binds at the test line, resulting in
formation of a line, i.e., a negative result. The absence or presence of the line is
determined visually by the operator.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To assess the precision of the device, the sponsor used both spiked
and clinical samples. The spiked samples were prepared at the
following concentrations: cutoff – 50%, cutoff – 25%, cutoff, cutoff
+25%, and the cutoff + 50%. All samples were analyzed with GC-
MS to confirm the concentration. Each concentration was then
tested using three lots of the candidate device. For each drug, thirty
samples (five clinical and 25 spiked) were analyzed at each
concentration, and each result was read by three viewers, for a total
of 90 results per concentration per lot. See summary data below.
Specimen description: drug free urine spiked with d-amphetamine,
d-methamphetamine, benzoylecgonine, 11-nor-delta-9-THC-9-COOH,
phencyclidine, morphine (for both the morphine and opiates assay),
methadone, secobarbital, oxazepam, nortryptyline, and
methylenedioxymethamphetamine. The sponsor also used clinical
samples containing the same compounds. The study protocol was
the same for all 12 analytes:
Number of days: one
Replicates per day: at each concentration, 90 replicates per lot
Lots of product used: three
Number of operators: three
Operator: laboratorian
Testing Facility: manufacturer

The sponsor also conducted a bridging study to demonstrate
comparable performance between the strip format and the cassette
format. Note: the multi-strip format is not housed in plastic but
consists of multiple strips with a holder. Since these are dipped and
read in the same manner as the single dipsticks, they were not
included in the bridging study.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. The assay is intended for qualitative use.
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
This device has an internal process control. A colored line appearing
in the control region confirms that sufficient sample volume has
traveled along the strip and that the membrane is intact. Users are
informed that the test is invalid if a colored line fails to appear in the
control region. External controls are not supplied with this device;
however, users are instructed to follow federal, state, and local
guidelines when determining when to run external controls.

d. Detection limit:
Sensitivity of this assay is characterized by validating performance
around the claimed cutoff concentration of the assay, including a
determination of the lowest concentration of drug that is capable of
producing a positive result. This information appears in the
precision section, above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking various concentrations of
similarly structured drug compounds into drug-free urine /a negative
control. By analyzing various concentration of each compound the
sponsor determined the concentration of the drug that produced a
response approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the
assay. Results of those studies appear in the table(s) below:

all 12 analytes: drug-free urine, drug-free urine spiked to an analyte
concentration 50% below the cutoff, and drug-free urine spiked to an
analyte concentration 50% above the cutoff of the targeted drug. 100
µg/mL of potentially interfering compounds were then added to separate
aliquots of the control samples and analyzed. There were no deviations
from the expected results; i.e., the drug-free and cutoff – 50% samples all
read negative, and the cutoff + 50% sample all read positive. All of the
compounds tested are listed in the package inserts.
There is the possibility that other substances and/or factors not listed
above may interfere with the test and cause false results, e.g., technical or
procedural errors.
To test for potential positive and negative interference from endogenous
conditions the sponsor prepared two control samples, one with drug-free
urine spiked to an analyte concentration 50% below the cutoff, and one
with drug-free urine spiked to 50% above the cutoff of the targeted drug.
Aliquots of the control samples were then altered to span the following
ranges of conditions, and analyzed:
4-9 pH
1.000 to 1.035 specific gravity
There was no change in test results as compared to the results of the
control sample. The sponsor did not evaluate the effects albumin on the
assay.
f. Assay cut-off:
Of the 12 analytes in this submission, six use cutoffs recommended
for use by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA): cannabinoids, cocaine, opiates,
phencyclidine, amphetamines, and MDMA
(methylenedioxymethamphetamine). SAMHSA has not
recommended cutoff concentrations for the other six analytes.
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the
claimed cutoff concentration appears in the precision section, above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Because the candidate device was compared to a reference method,
GC/MS, it was not compared to a predicate device.

Sample description: Unaltered clinical urine samples were evaluated.
A portion of samples having drug concentrations that were below the
cutoff concentration of the assay were also evaluated by GC/MS.
The study included an adequate number of samples that contained
drugs near to the cutoff concentration of the assay. Approximately
40% of the study samples are evenly distributed between plus and
minus 50% of the claimed cutoff concentration.
Number of study sites: one
