one polyclonal
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was conducted based on NCCLS EP5-A. Four matrix controls and
five plasma controls were run in duplicates, twice a day for 20 days (N=80).
Matrix controls were comprised of human MPO derived from cell culture in a
phosphate-buffered matrix. Plasma controls were comprised of human MPO
derived from cell culture in human lithium heparin plasma. For matrix control
1 and 3 and plasma control 1, N=76 (19 days) due to outliers caused by
pipetting errors and control concentrations. The results are summarized
below.
The average total % CV for the matrix controls and plasma controls were
7.8% and 8.2% respectively. The average within-run % CV for the matrix
controls and plasma controls were 6.1% and 5.5% respectively.
4

--- Page 5 ---
Precision was conducted to determine the variability of the Prognostic
CardioMPO Test using different lots of the reagent kit. Three lots of the
CardioMPO reagent kits were analyzed with nine patient samples, four matrix
controls and five plasma controls. Between-lot variability was analyzed by
comparing the mean MPO concentration of each sample measured using one
reagent kit lot against the overall MPO concentration of each sample across all
three reagent kit lots using Passing and Bablok regression. The linear
equations for the three lots were Y=1.0023X -50.171, Y=0.9971X +22.759
and Y=1.0249X + 14.168 respectively. The sponsor concludes that no
significant difference in MPO measurement related to different CardioMPO
reagent kit lots.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was conducted according to NCCLS EP6-A. Five high MPO
plasma samples were prepared by spiking 5 plasma samples to reach a MPO
concentration above the expected linear range. Four low MPO plasma
samples were created by mixing the previously prepared high MPO samples
with neat plasma samples. Five test samples were analyzed in triplicates with
Prognostix CardioMPO reagent kit. Linearity was assessed using the
polynomial evaluation of linearity, whereas the high and low level
concentrations at which all three non-linear coefficients were found not to be
significant (within a 95% confidence interval) were considered the linear
range for that sample. A linear regression was completed and the percent
difference between the apparent MPO concentration at each test level and the
MPO concentration predicted from the linear regression was calculated. The
five sample results were compiled and the greatest MPO concentration that
remained within the linear range was 5223 pM and the lowest was 10 pM.
Please see the chart below.
Results of the linearity evaluation of five Test Samples
(Shaded values were found to be outside the linear range)
5

--- Page 6 ---
The linear equations for the 5 samples were
Sample 1 Y= 665.03X-398.18,
Sample 2 Y= 997.9X-520.36,
Sample 3 Y=592.11X-234.3,
Sample 4 Y=631.73X-522.84 and
Sample 5 Y=566.15X-515.08.
The sponsor states that samples at the low end of the linear range were
somewhat imprecise when compared to the rest of the range and that the
imprecision was within 60 pM. The sponsor also stated that 60 pM is not
clinically relevant at low MPO concentrations. The remaining samples
revealed less than 9% deviation from the linear regression result. The
CardioMPO test is linear from 13 to 5223 pM MPO, within 60 pM or 9% in
this interval.
The hook effect was studied to determine if plasma samples containing
excessively high levels of MPO can cause a hook in the absorbance that
would result in reportable MPO reading when no absorbance reading should
be available. Purified MPO was diluted in calibrator matrix concentrations up
to 800,000 pM MPO, which is approximately 150 times greater that the upper
end of the reportable range and 500 times greater that the median levels of
patients in the clinical study. All the samples were reported as having
concentrations greater than the reportable range.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The CardioMPO controls and calibrators are prepared from commercially
available concentrated human MPO stock. MPO from the lysed cells is
purified. An intermediate stock solution is prepared gravimetrically from the
MPO stock solution and calibrator matrix. A working MPO stock solution is
prepared by further diluting the intermediate stock solution in calibrator
matrix. Calibrators A – E are prepared gravimetrically adding working stock
solutions to calibrator matrix. Calibrator F is comprised of calibrator matrix
only. Controls 1-3 are prepared by gravimetrically adding the working MPO
stock solution to human lithium heparin plasma.
Values are assigned to new calibrators through the use of a set of six gold
standard calibrators. Gold standard calibrators were created from a single lot
of MPO. New working calibrator lots are analyzed against the gold standard
calibrators in the CardioMPO test in duplicate for five days at two runs per
day. The mean MPO concentrations calculated from the twenty replicates are
6

--- Page 7 ---
verified for precision and concentrations are assigned to the new working
calibrators. Concentrations values and ranges are assigned for new controls
lots though the same assignment process as for the calibrators, although the
new controls may be analyzed against working calibrators.
Stability
Two accelerated stability studies were conducted with the CardioMPO
Control kit- Opened/thawed and Unopened/frozen. Plasma controls with
MPO concentrations spanning the calibration range (one neat plasma sample
and two or three plasma samples spiked with MPO) were used to simulate
stability of both controls and plasma samples and stored at 45°, 35°, room
temperature and 4°C, removed and assayed periodically. The sponsor
suggests storing plasma samples and controls for no more than 8 hours at
room temperature (20-26°C) and 14 days at 4°C. The results from the
accelerated stability studies at elevated temperatures claim the controls/plasma
samples will be stable for greater than one year at -20°C.
To evaluate freeze thaw stability conditions, the same plasma controls were
stored at -20°C and -80°C, thawed, assayed and returned to frozen storage.
No degradation of MPO was observed over 2 freeze/thaw cycles for 18 days
at -20°C or 7 freeze/that cycles for 21 days at -80°C.
To evaluate unopened/frozen controls, the plasma controls discussed in the
open/thaw study above were stored at -80°C. Periodically a set of controls
were removed, thawed and assayed with the CardioMPO test. No MPO
degradation was observed in unopened, frozen controls at 41 days.
Real-time controls/plasma sample stability studies are ongoing; the control kit
will be labeled as stable for 6 months.
Two accelerated stability studies were conducted with the CardioMPO
Calibrator kit- Opened/thawed and Unopened/frozen. Calibrators were stored
at 45°, 35° and 4°C and were periodically removed from storage, assayed and
returned. At 45° and 35°C, the calibrators lost ~37% and ~23% after one day
respectively. When stored at 4°C, the calibrators maintained 99% of their
initial MPO concentration after 14 days and 86% after 43 days. The sponsor
recommends storing calibrators for no more than 14 days at 4°c.
To evaluate unopened/frozen calibrators, several set of calibrators were
aliquotted and stored at -80°C. Periodically, a set of calibrators was removed,
thawed and assayed in the CardioMPO test. No MPO degradation was
observed in unopened, frozen calibrators after 41 days. The sponsor states
that unopened vials will be labeled as stable for 6 months.

d. Detection limit:
The zero calibrator material (F) was assayed 24 times. The mean plus two
standard deviation value was calculated by interpolation as 13 pM
myeloperoxidase.
e. Analytical specificity:
Three studies were conducted to assess analytical specificity- cross reactivity,
interfering substances and interfering antibodies and were assessed according
to NCCLS EP7-A.
Cross reactivity was conducted on eleven potentially cross-reactive proteins at
3 difference concentrations in human plasma and assay buffer. Cross
reactivity was calculated by the following equation:
æMeasured MPO conc. (pM) - True MPO conc. (pM)ö
% Cross-reactivity=100´ç ÷
ç ÷
è Cross-reactant concentration (pM) ø
All controls were run (excluding the PBS blank) twice in duplicate and the
cross reactivity samples were run in triplicate. All proteins showed less than
0.05% cross reactivity at the highest test concentration and less than 1.8%
cross reactivity at the lowest test concentration when added to a plasma pool.
When added to the assay buffer, the proteins showed less than 0.09% cross
reactivity at the highest test concentration and less than 0.2% at the lowest
concentration. Elastase produced some slight cross reactivity but the sponsor
determined it to be clinically insignificant. The results are shown in the table
below.
An interfering substances study was conducted to determine if substances
likely to be in patient samples would interfere with the CardioMPO test.
8

--- Page 9 ---
Interference testing was conducted according to NCCLS EP7-A. 26 samples
were spiked with MPO values of 1000 pM and 3000 pM. 16 drugs and
dietary substances, 8 endogenous (which included triglycerides, hemoglobin
and bilirubin) and 2 anticoagulants/preservatives were run in 8 replicates. An
interference screen was conducted on 22/26 samples. A dose response study
was conducted of hemoglobin, conjugated bilirubin (2) and triglycerides. 5
test pools were created by diluting the 3000 pM MPO plasma pool with high
concentrations of interferent with a 3000 pM MPO plasma pool containing a
low concentration of interferents. Percent interference was calculated by
æMean MPO conc. (pM)of inter. substance - Mean MPO conc. (pM) of control poolö
100´ç ÷
ç ÷
è Mean MPO conc. of control pool ø
The sponsor’s acceptance criterion of bias was interference greater than 10%.
All substances listed, excluding hemoglobin and conjugated bilirubin did not
cause interference with the CardioMPO test. The results of the plasma
interference are listed in the chart below.
9

--- Page 10 ---
Hemoglobin, conjugated bilirubin and triglycerides were studied further in a
dose response study. No interference was detected for triglycerides levels up
to 5000 mg/L and for conjugated bilirubin levels up to 50 mg/L. The linear
regression for triglycerides and conjugated bilirubin were Y= -0.0119X +2760
(R2=0.1231) and Y=0.0017X + 2710.4 (R2= 0.0038), respectively.
Hemoglobin revealed slight interference when tested at concentrations greater
than 1500 mg/L and none at values less than 1500 mg/L. Hemoglobin
revealed a linear regression equation of Y= 0.0723X + 2834.5.
Heterophilic antibodies which included anti MPO p-anti-neutrophil
cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA), HAMA, and RF were tested for interference
with the Prognostix CardioMPO test. 3 groups of samples were analyzed.
10

--- Page 11 ---
Group 1 contained eight samples known to have elevated levels of HAMA or
RF antibodies. Group 2 contained eight samples known to have elevated
levels of heterophilic antibodies other than HAMA and RF (i.e. anti-goat &
anti-rabbit). Group 3 contained five samples with elevated levels of p-ANCA
specific to MPO (anti-MPO pANCA positive) were analyzed. Each plasma
sample was diluted 1:1 in normal donor plasma and the heterophilic antibody
sample and was analyzed for linearity. Interference for heterophilic
antibodies was determined to be % recovery of greater than 20%. The percent
recovery was calculated by dividing the measured MPO concentration by the
expected MPO concentration. The HAMA/RF positive, HAMA/RF negative
and antiMPO pANCA positive results showed a mean recovery of 111% (101-
118), 107% (89-118) and 107% (101-114) respectively.
A spiking recovery study was conducted on 14 spiked plasma samples to
determine the CardioMPO test ability to recover 3 levels of MPO (516 pM,
1016 pM and 1500 pM). The samples were analyzed in duplicates and the %
recovery was calculated. The percent recovery equation was calculated by
dividing the sum of the mean measured MPO concentration of the spiked
sample by the sum of the mean measured MPO concentration of the neat
plasma sample plus the MPO concentration of the spike. The average
recovery for the 510 pM spike was 95.3% (range from 84.7% to 103.4%).
The average recovery for the 1016 pM was 99.1% (range from 80% to
122.4%). The average recovery for the 1500 pM pike was 95.4% (range from
81.2% to 104.3%).
A dilution recovery study was conducted to determine the test ability to
measure MPO in pre-diluted plasma samples (with assay buffer). 13 plasma
samples were spiked with 1500 pM MPO and diluted to 4 levels (1:2, 1:4, 1:8
and 1:16) with assay buffer and analyzed for recovery by the CardioMPO test.
The % recovery was calculated by dividing the mean measured MPO
concentration of the pre-diluted sample multiplied by the dilution factor by the
mean MPO concentration of the sample with pre-dilution. The average
recovery of a 1:2 dilution was 116% (range from 102% to 131%), 1:4 dilution
was 132% (range from 117% to 169%), 1:8 dilution was 140% (range from
113 to 175%) and 1:16 dilution was 144% (range from 115% to 167%). The
sponsor states the test kit is formulated to account for matrix effects associated
with a 5 mL human plasma sample. The sponsor does not recommend
performing a sample dilution and that if a dilution is required; a 1:2 dilution is
recommended with the knowledge that the MPO concentration obtained will
be ~16% greater than the actual value.

3. Clinical studies:
Two clinical studies were performed using the CardioMPO test; one
myeloperoxidase in normal subjects that is presented in the expected values
section of this template below and the second study was a re-analysis of
myeloperoxidase in patients presented to an emergency room complaining of
chest pain. The sponsor conducted a re-analysis of samples from a study
published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study examined the
prognostic value of MPO levels in subjects with chest pain by using “research use
only” MPO test reagents.
The MPO levels in 560 banked lithium heparin plasma samples from the study
were measured to determine the efficacy of the test as a predictor of risk for major
adverse cardiac events (MACE). MPO levels in patients, 23 to 96 years of age,
were measured using the CardioMPO test, calibrators and controls. The patients’
had enrolled in an earlier study of the diagnosis of myocardial infarction with
necrotic biomarkers. Some patients were excluded statistically if one of the
following variables were missing regarding the patient- age, Troponin T level,
gender, race, history of smoking, history of diabetes, history of hypertension, C-
reactive protein level, history of high cholesterol and CK-MB level. After
exclusion, the number of patient samples dropped to 523.
These samples were measured for MPO levels, Troponin T levels, C-reactive
protein levels, and CK-MB mass levels.
Patients were followed for the development of major adverse cardiac events
(MACE) over the next 6 months. Myocardial infarction was defined by Troponin
T levels of at least 0.1 ng/mL. The need for revascularization was defined as
coronary-artery bypass surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention or
catheterization with stenosis in at least two major coronary vessels of more than
70%. The incidence of MACE was assessed by follow up phone calls at 30 days
and 6 months.
Differences between groups in the outcome and associations among categorical
variables were assessed with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Trends for unadjusted
12

--- Page 13 ---
analyses were evaluated with the Cochran-Armitage trend test. Correlations
among continuous variables were assessed with the Spearman rank-correlation
coefficient. Multivariate logistic-regression models (SAS version 8.0, SAS
Institute) were developed to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.
Plasma levels of MPO in patients presented with chest pain ranged from 181 to
10290 pM with a median of 1854 pM (25th and 75th percentile of 1082 and 2990
respectively). These levels differ significantly when compared to normal blood
donors with plasma MPO levels with a median of 193 (25th and 75th percentile of
138 and 288 pM respectively). MPO levels in these patients weakly correlated
with peak troponin T levels (r=0.22) and C-reactive protein levels (r=0.015) but
not with age (r=0.068) or sex (r=0.081). MPO levels were significantly higher in
current smokers, patients with a history of smoking, hyperlipidemia and
revascularization in patients that had a MI within 16 hours after presentation. See
the charted results below.

The risk of MACE at 30 days increased with increasing MPO levels. An odds
ratio analysis by the sponsor for MACE at 30 days by quartile of MPO level and
revealed that increased levels of plasma MPO was a significant predictor of risk
for MACE (3-fold increase for MPO in the 4th quartile).
The sponsor also conducted a similar analysis for the patients that were
persistently negative for Troponin T which also revealed a significantly higher
risk of MACE for patients with higher MPO levels. See table and graph below.

rises ~ 6.9 fold for those with MPO levels in the 4th quartile relative to those with
MPO levels in the 1st quartile.
The sponsor claims that more patients who experienced MACE over the following six
months were identified by the combination of either an elevated Troponin or MPO
level.
4. Clinical cut-off:
N/A
5. Expected values/Reference range:
300 samples from apparently healthy subjects (150 of each sex) in the age range
22 to 60 (median age of 46) were evaluated. The sponsor states that there is no
evidence of a correlation between MPO levels and age in the patients presenting
with chest pain and felt it appropriate to analyze a population of “normal”
subjects over an age range typical to patients with chest pain (40 years of age or
more). The samples were analyzed in duplicates with the kit, controls and
calibrators. A Box-Cox transformation was applied to all the data to fit a normal
distribution and limits were set based on the 25th to 75th percentile range of the
transformed data.
The sponsor found no significant difference in MPO levels between sexes. The
median MPO level for subjects in the adjusted normal subject population was 193
pM, the overall range of result was 48 to 924 pM and the interquartile range was
138 to 288 pM. The distribution is shown below. The sponsor states that 95% of
the CardioMPO test results on a healthy normal population are expected to fall
below 539 pM.
