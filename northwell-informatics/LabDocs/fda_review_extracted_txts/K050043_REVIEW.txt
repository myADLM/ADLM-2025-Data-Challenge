H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
For use with MicroScan® Dried Gram Positive MIC/Combo, Dried Gram
Positive Breakpoint Combo and Dried Gram Positive ID Type 2 panels.
MicroScan® Positive panels are designed for use in determining antimicrobial
agent susceptibility and/or identification to the species level of rapidly growing
aerobic and facultatively gram-positive cocci, some fastidious aerobic gram
positive cocci and Listeria monocytogenes. Refer to Limitation of Procedure
Section for use with fastidious streptococci.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The MicroScan® Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel is used to determine
quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies
grown on solid media of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram
positive cocci. This indication is for the addition of the antimicrobial
erythromycin at concentrations of 0.25 to 16 ug/mL to the test panel.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The Prompt® method of inoculation is an alternate method of inoculation
preparation that is supported in the methodology along with the turbidity method.
The stationary and log inoculum methods should not be used with this antibiotic.
Results should not be reported for Listeria monocytogenes.
4. Special instrument requirements:
These panels can be read at > 16 hours of incubation either manually,
automatically on the autoScan® 4, or with the WalkAway® instrument systems.
I. Device Description:
The MicroScanâ Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel contains microdilutions of
each antimicrobial agent in various concentrations with Mueller Hinton Broth and
various nutrients which are dehydrated and dried in panels. Each panel contains two
control wells: a no-growth control well (contains water only/no nutrients or broth),
and a growth control well (contains test medium without antibiotic). The panel is
rehydrated and inoculated at the same time with 0.1 ml of suspension prepared by the
turbidity method (inoculum prepared in water, then 0.1ml transferred to 25ml of
inoculum water containing pluronic-D/F-a wetting solution) for a final inoculum of 3-
2

--- Page 3 ---
7 X 105. The Prompt® method of inoculation is also recommended as an alternate
means of preparing the inoculum. The panels are incubated at 35o C in a non-CO
2
incubator for 16-20 hours and read by visual observation of growth. Panels may also
be read automatically with the WalkAway® or the AutoScan®4.

L. Test Principle:
After incubation in a non-CO incubator for 16-20 hours, the minimum inhibitory
2
concentration (MIC) for the test organisms are read by determining the lowest
antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth. The panels are read either
manually using a touchScan® SR, or with the autoScan 4® or the WalkAway®
instrument, which uses an optics systems with growth algorithms to directly measure
organism growth.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates tested at 3 sites on 3
separate days in triplicate. All ten isolates had a mode that was on scale. The
mode was determined by the method used and therefore is not always the
same for each method. The study included the testing of the following
inoculum and reading variables; turbidity inoculum method and Prompt®
method of inoculation with reading performed manually using a touchScan
SR, autoScan 4® or the WalkAway® instrument. The following table
provides the overall results for all combinations of these variables

and the actual result with each different variable for between site reproducibility

Prompt® WalkAway ® 3 26 226 18 1
Prompt® autoScan® 4 5 27 188 47 4
The data demonstrates that there is good reproducibility of each method but
since the modes of each are used and they may not be the same, this does not
demonstrate if there is a difference between methods. The actual data points
and the modes did demonstrate that when there was a difference the Prompt®
method of inoculation was more resistant if only by one well. This was more
apparent in the Staphylococcus isolates. These were the same isolates that
were used in the colony count inoculum density study which did demonstrate
a higher CFU for the staphylococcus which would explain the trend here.

The difference in the staphylococci manual turbidity readings and the manual
Prompt® reading results demonstrated the same effect observed in the
reproducibility where there was a difference of one well more resistance for
the Prompt® method of inoculation and even more pronounced with the
Prompt® method of inoculation and the manual readings. This would be

expected since the Prompt® method of inoculation often produces a higher
CFU/ml in the final panel.
Inoculum density control: A turbidity meter was used for the turbidity
inoculation method with daily checks. The Prompt® method of inoculation
had colony counts performed periodically throughout the study to determine
the average inoculum density since there is no visual check of the inoculum
using this device. The Prompt® method of inoculation had far more
variability with average inoculum ranges from 5.08x105-1.8x 106 with an
actual data point range of 3.7 x 104 to 5.9 x 106. The inoculum of the
Prompt® method of inoculation generally provides a higher number of CFU
with more variability than a method using a turbidity meter as demonstrated in
this study. The average of the staphylococcus tested was outside the
recommended range for the CLSI reference method. The user is referred to
the limitation section for the recommendations of when to use an alternate
method.
The firm conducted a Pluronic F validation study to authenticate the use of
Pluronic to inoculate frozen reference panels. When MICs from frozen
reference panels inoculated with water were compared to panels inoculated
with water and Pluronic, the essential agreement was acceptable.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical testing was performed at three sites using fresh isolates supplemented
with stock isolates. A comparison of the MicroScan® Dried Gram-Positive
test panel results was made to the reference method conducted as
recommended in the CLSI standard M7-A6 except for the Pluronic F
inoculum water. Testing of the reference method and the MicroScan® panels
was performed at the same time. A challenge set was also tested at one site
and compared to the reference broth dilution result mode that was determined
by previous testing of each isolate multiple times in the recommended
reference panel. Staphylococcus spp., beta hemolytic streptococcus and
6

Enterococcus spp. were considered in the evaluation. All isolates tested grew
in the MicroScan® panels.

Evaluable results are those that fall within the test range of the reference
method and could also be on-scale with the new device if within the
plus/minus one well variability. EA is when there is agreement between the
reference method and the MicroScan® within plus or minus one serial two-
fold dilution of antibiotic. CA is when the interpretation of the reference
method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the MicroScan® result.
The challenge set of organisms was also tested using the Prompt® method of
inoculation with all reading methods and the turbidity method of inoculation
with the WalkAway® and the autoScan®4. This included one hundred thirty
four challenge isolates that were tested at one site. The inoculum was
prepared by the turbidity or Prompt® method and incubated in the
WalkAway® instrument. All panels had additional readings performed after
the WalkAway® reading was completed using the autoScan®-4 and then
manually on the touchSCAN®-SR. The table below demonstrates the
numbers that were in exact agreement with the reference method result and
those that differed by one or more wells.
