--- Page 2 ---
2. Indication(s) for use:
The On Call™ Multi-Drug Home Test for Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamine,
Methamphetamine, Opiates, and Phencyclidine is a screening test for the rapid
detection of Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Opiates,
and Phencyclidine in urine at a designated cut-off concentration of 50 ng/mL
for Marijuana, 300 ng/mL for Cocaine, 1,000 ng/mL for Amphetamine, 1,000
ng/mL for Methamphetamine, 2,000 ng/mL for Opiates, and 25 ng/mL for
Phencyclidine. The test is intended for over-the-counter (OTC) consumer use.
This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific
alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional
judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when
preliminary positive results are indicated.
3. Special condition for use statement(s):
The On Call™ Multi-Drug Home Test provides only a preliminary analytical
test result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used to
obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/Mass spectrometry
is the preferred confirmatory method. Other chemical confirmation methods
are available. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive
results are indicated.
This assay is for OTC use.
The materials necessary for confirmational testing are provided with the
screening device. Materials, as well as confirmational testing, are provided to
the consumer at no additional cost. The consumer pays for shipment of the
sample to the laboratory.
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Not applicable. The device is a visually read single-use device.
F. Device Description:
The product is a single-use visually read cassette device. It has a plastic housing that
contains the test strip. A plastic sample dropper is also provided with the device.
Several drops of urine are added to start the test which employs traditional
immunochromatographic technology.
G. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
ACON Multi-Drug Multi-line Test Device, First Check Home Drug Test,
Pharmatech at Home Drug Test and Accu-Stat™ Home Drug Test.

2. Predicate K number(s):
k020313, k993852, k003858 and k040629
3. Comparison with predicate:
This device and the predicate cleared under k020313 are identical in product
design, performance characteristics, materials, manufacturing, matrix used
and are intended for use as an initial screening method subject to
confirmation. The proposed device is intended to be sold over the counter
(OTC) while the device cleared under k020313 is prescription use only.
Predicates cleared under k993852, k003858 and k040629 are all OTC
products.
H. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
The sponsor did not reference any standards or guidance documents in their pre-
market submission.
I. Test Principle:
The device employs lateral flow immunochromatographic technology and is based on
the principle of competitive binding. Drugs, if present in concentrations below the
cutoff level, will not saturate the binding sites of the antibody coated particles on the
drug specific test strips. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by
immobilized drug-specific conjugate and a colored line will appear in the control
region and the test region. If the sample contains drugs above the cutoff level, a
colored line will not appear in the strips test region. Formation of a colored line in
the control region indicates that the proper volume of urine has been added. If a
colored line does not appear in the control region, the test result is inconclusive and
should be repeated. The absence or presence of the line is determined visually by the
operator.
J. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The accuracy and precision of the test was demonstrated in a
consumer study. 503 unique tests were performed by consumers
using drug-free urine that had been spiked with various
concentrations and combinations of drugs. Each drug was tested at
0%, 50%, 75%, 125%, 150%, and 200% of the target concentration.
Some samples contained as many as three drugs; there were
combinations that contained no drugs at all. At least 21 but not more
than 34 tests were performed for each combination. Drug
concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS; recovery ranged between
81 to 116% of the target concentration. Approximately 10% of the
consumers had used a home drug kit before. 98% reported that they
were high-school graduates and the ratio of female to male was
approximately 1:1. Four geographic locations were cited but the
settings were not specified.

The results of the study are summarized in the table below:
Cutoff
Number Correctly Incorrectly
Drug Concentration
of Studies Interpreted Interpreted*
(ng/ml)
THC 50 169 167 2
COC 300 165 163 2
AMP 1000 165 161 4
mAMP 1000 163 161 2
OPI 2000 161 161 2
PCP 25 167 165 2
* All samples that were interpreted incorrectly were ±25% of the
cutoff value (75% or 125% of target).
A consumer questionnaire was administered to evaluate labeling
effectiveness. It asked only one question: “Was the test easy to
interpret?” Thus it did not determine whether the labeling adequately
alerted users to the limitations of home use testing devices. Only
one participant of 503 responded that the test was not easy to
interpret.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable for a qualitative assay.
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
The device has an internal process control. Users are informed that
the control indicates that sufficient urine was added to the test. This
is typical of OTC tests. Users are also informed not to interpret the
test if the control line does not form.
d. Detection limit:
Performance Characteristics have been addressed in k020313
(ACON Multi-Drug Multi-line Test Device).
e. Analytical specificity:
Performance Characteristics have been addressed in k020313
(ACON Multi-Drug Multi-line Test Device).
f. Assay cut-off:
The identified cutoff concentrations are those recommended by the
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
