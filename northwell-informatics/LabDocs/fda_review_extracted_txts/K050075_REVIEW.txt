E. Applicant:
bioMerieux, Inc.
F. Proprietary and Established Names:
VITEK® 2 Gram Positive Daptomycin
G. Regulatory Information:
1. Regulation section:
866.1645 Short-Term Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test System
2. Classification:
II
3. Product Code:
LON System, Test, Automated, Antimicrobial Susceptibility, Short Incubation
4. Panel:
83 Microbiology
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The VITEK® 2 Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) is intended to be used
with the VITEK® 2 System for the automated quantitative or qualitative
susceptibility testing of isolated colonies for the most clinically significant
aerobic gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp.,
Streptococcus agalactiae, and S. pneumoniae.
The VITEK®2 Gram Positive susceptibility Card is intended for use with the
VITEK 2 System in clinical laboratories as an in vitro test to determine the
susceptibility of Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., and Streptococcus

agalactiae to antimicrobial agents when used as instructed in the Online Product
Information.
2. Indication(s) for use:
This submission is for the addition of the antibiotic Daptomycin at
concentrations at 8,16 and 32 ug/mL for a calling range of <0.5->16ug/mL to
the VITEK®2 gram positive susceptibility CARD for the testing of appropriate
gram positive isolates.
3. Special condition for use statement(s):
Prescription Use only.
The ability of the AST card to detect resistance among the appropriate gram
positive isolates with daptomycin is unknown because resistant strains among
the gram positive isolates tested were not available at the time of comparative
testing.
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Not applicable
I. Device Description:
Each VITEK® 2 test card contains 64 microwells. A control well, that contains only
microbiological culture medium is resident on all cards, with the remaining wells
containing premeasured amounts of a specific antibiotic combined with culture
medium. A suspension of organism is made in 0.45 % sterile saline from a pure
culture and standardized to a McFarland 0.5 standard using the DensiChek. The
desired card (s) are placed in the cassette along with an empty tube for the
susceptibility card. The cassette is placed into the VITEK® 2 instrument where a
susceptibility test will be automatically diluted from the ID suspension by the
VITEK® 2. The cards are then automatically vacuum filled; the tubes are cut and the
cards sealed prior to proceeding to the incubator/reader for incubation (35.5o C) and
optical scanning during testing. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) readings
are performed every 15 minutes.
There is also an alternate manual dilution method of the organism that is
recommended in the package insert.

(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S15) “Methods
for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
Optics systems use visible light to directly measure organism growth. These
transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant
growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure
organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through the well. An
interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for an early reading of results with
an option to incubate up to 18 hours if necessary. The VITEK®2 Susceptibility Card
test is based on the microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration technique with
concentrations equivalent to standard method concentrations. Several parameters
based on the growth characteristics observed are used to provide appropriate input for
the MIC calculations. Discriminate analysis is used to develop the algorithm that
determines the susceptibility result for all antimicrobials on the VITEK® 2 system.
The MIC result must be linked to an organism identification in order to determine a
category interpretation. An MIC along with a category interpretation will be
reported.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Ten on-scale gram positive organisms were tested in triplicate at
each of three sites for three days for an overall inter reproducibility
of >95%. Ten on-scale organisms were also tested at each site three
times each to determine intra reproducibility of >95%. This testing

also the automatic dilution method.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the
auto-dilution and the manual method of diluting the organisms. This
included the two recommended QC organisms with the following
results.
Inoculum density control: Internal verification of the DensiChek
was performed using 2 ATCC organisms and five instruments with
50 results available for each organism. The clinical sites also
performed weekly standardization of the DensiChek used at that site.
All recorded calibrated values were within acceptable parameters.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A comparison of the clinical data was performed to the broth
microdilution reference method as described in the NCCLS M7.
Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., and Streptococcus
agalactiae were tested at three sites that included both clinical and
challenge isolates. All of the test organisms that provided results
did so in <16 hours. Testing was performed using the auto dilution
feature. Since the Staphylococcus and Beta Streptococcus have a
different break-point (BP) from the Enterococcus, they are
presented separately in the table below:

Major, very major, and minor errors were not calculated because
there is only a susceptible category. The very good EA would
demonstrate acceptability. CA is when the interpretation of the
reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the

reference method and the Vitek ® 2 results are within plus or minus
one serial two-fold dilution of antibiotic. The %EA and CA are
acceptable when compared to the reference method as described in
the FDA guidance document, “Class II Special Controls Guidance
Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems;
Guidance for Industry and FDA”.
The challenge set of organisms was also tested at one site using the
manual method of inoculation with the following performance that
demonstrated that there was little or no difference between the two
inoculation methods. There is no evidence of trending.
