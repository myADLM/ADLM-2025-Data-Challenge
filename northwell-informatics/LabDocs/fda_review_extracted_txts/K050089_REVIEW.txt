concentrations of 2/1 – 32/16 µg/mL to the gram-positive susceptibility panel.
3. Special condition for use statement(s):
Prescription use only
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Not applicable
I. Device Description:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST
Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as gram-positive or gram-negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and
equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™
Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST broth, which contains an AST
indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST broth is a cation-adjusted formulation
of Mueller-Hinton broth containing 0.01% Tween 80. After adding the indicator solution
to the AST inoculum the color is blue and after inoculation and incubation goes to pink to
colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned
and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System instrument where
the panels are continuously incubated at 35°C. The AST has a final inoculum of 5 x 105
CFU/ml. The instrument incubates, reads and records the results of the biochemical
substrates and antimicrobial agents and interprets the reactions to give an ID of the isolate
and MIC value and category interpretation of the antimicrobial agents. Organisms
growing in the presence of a given antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator, signaling
organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or inhibited
by a given antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do not
produce a color change. Additional interpretation is done using software driven
“EXPERT” System using rules derived from the CLSI standards.
Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an ID result available between 2-12 hours and
an AST result available between 4-16 hours. This is only an autoread result; there are no
manual readings possible.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S15) “Methods
for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard.”
L. Test Principle:
The system employs conventional, colorimetric, fluorogenic and chromogenic
substrates to identify the genus and species of the isolate. The AST portion of the BD
Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth based microdilution method
that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance detection
of organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells
containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control
wells” which contains no antibiotic.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Fifteen gram positive isolates were evaluated for site to site and inter
site reproducibility demonstrating >95% reproducibility. The ten
isolate study described in the guidance document was used (10
organisms tested 3 times on 3 days at 3 sites).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
The CLSI recommended QC isolates for this drug were both gram-
negative organisms which would not be appropriate for the panel
tested therefore, S. aureus ATCC 29213 was used for this purpose.
It was tested on every test occasion with the reference method and
the BD Phoenix™. Since this QC strain is not recommended by
CLSI, results obtained for this QC organism with the reference
system was not used to determine the acceptability of the data
obtained from isolates tested on a given day. The Phoenix™ was
tested a sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the system
can produce QC results in the expected range most of the time. The
BD Phoenix ™ and the reference device had the same mode for the
QC organism. Additional QC organisms were tested with the
reference method as shown in the table below to determine the
acceptability of the data obtained from isolates tested on that given
day.

Inoculum density control: The organism suspension density of the
ID broth was equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard using the
BBL™ CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer which was verified each day
of testing. Internal data was used to demonstrate that the use of the
BBL™ CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer would produce reproducible
results. Five different instruments were used.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The CLSI recommended broth dilution reference panel was
prepared according to the CLSI standards. Clinical testing was
performed at four sites. The testing included both fresh clinical
isolates and stock isolates along with a challenge set with known
results. Since Oxacillin Resistant isolates will be reported as
Resistant, only Oxacillin Sensitive isolates were evaluated. The
test device had a growth rate of greater than 90%. A comparison
was provided to the reference method with the following agreement.
Staphylococcus spp. is presented in the table below because it has different breakpoints
than the Enterococcus spp. The overall performance of this drug with these two
organism groups is acceptable.
