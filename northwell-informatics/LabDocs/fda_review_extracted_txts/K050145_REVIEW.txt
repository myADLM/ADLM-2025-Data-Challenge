510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
K050145
B. Purpose for Submission:
Redesign of the instrument configuration to place the fluorescent microscope, camera,
sample handling mechanism (stage), mercury arc lamp and power supply within a
single housing with replacement of obsolete components (e.g., camera) by the same
manufacturer of both instruments, Immunicon Corporation.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Immunicon Corporation’s CellTracks Analyzer II
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
A semi-automated qualitative immunomagnetic-capture immunofluorescent detection
image analysis fluorescence microscope used to aid the CLIA compliant CellTracks
trained testing personnel in the enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTC) (cells
appearing like tumor cells with epithelial cell markers and no lymphocyte marker on
their surfaces).
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The CellTracks® Analyzer II is a semi-automated fluorescence microscope. The
product consists of the CellTracks® Analyzer II, a dedicated computer loaded
with CellTracks® software, monitor, keyboard and mouse.
2. Principles of Operation:
The CellTracks® Analyzer II is used in conjunction with the CellTracks®
AutoPrep System and reagent kits that contain a ferro-fluid-based capture reagent
and immunofluorescent reagents for detection and characterization of the captured
cells. The ferrofluid reagent consists of nano-particles with a magnetic core
surrounded by a polymeric layer coated with antibodies targeting the cells of
interest. For example, the CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell Kit (available
from Veridex, LLC, a Johnson and Johnson company) contains anti-EpCam
ferrofluid that targets the Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule for capturing
circulating tumor cells (CTCs), whereas the CellTracks® Endothelial Cell Kit
contains anti-CD146 ferrofluid to capture CD146+ cells. After immunomagnetic
capture and enrichment, fluorescent reagents are added for identification and
enumeration of the target cells.
The processed reagent/sample mixture is dispensed by the CellTracks® AutoPrep
System into a cartridge that is inserted into a MagNest® cell presentation device.
The strong magnetic field of the MagNest® device causes the magnetically-
labeled target cells to move to the surface of the cartridge. The cartridge is then
placed on the CellTracks Analyzer II for data acquisition and analysis. The
CellTracks Analyzer II scans the entire surface of the cartridge with a series of
fluorescence filters that are defined for a given assay. Cell images from each
filter are compiled and presented in a gallery format for final cell classification by
1

the user.
3. Modes of Operation:
Semi-automated one-at-a-time MagNest® analysis.
4. Specimen Identification:
Identification information entered individually for each patient sample.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The MagNest® is not mixed or pierced, but put into place manually and then the
surface is automatically scanned. The CLIA compliant CellTracks trained testing
personnel then manually interprets the results.
6. Calibration:
Insert the CellTracks® System Verification Cartridge into its holder, enter the
cartridge ID number, place into the CellTracks® Analyzer II, close the door and
click the OK button. A progress bar is displayed while system verification is in
progress. The CellTracks® System Verification Cartridge contains a strip of
material impregnated with dyes. System verification checks the optical
performance and chamber “skew” which ensures proper scanning. There is no
recognized reference material or method.
7. Quality Control:
For the circulating tumor cell assay the CellSearch® Circulating Tumor Cell
Control Kit should be run once per day of patient testing as a patient sample
following each user’s quality assurance program.

1Changes in camera precipitated due to Hamamatsu camera no longer being
available. The Sony ICX285 AL is the successor to the Sony ICX085 used in the
CellSpotter camera. The increase in total number of pixels will result in higher
resolution. The increase in the quantum efficiency allows the system to measure
more signal therefore requiring less power and eliminating the need for a rear
reflector.
2 The change to automatic ND Filter and Edge Focus in CellTracks® Analyzer II
eliminates the Joystick control box on the CellSpotter® Analyzer. The
CellTracks® Analyzer II automates the ND filter process by actuating the filter at
the proper times in the instrument setup, thus eliminating the potential for
operator error of leaving the filter in place during a scan of a specimen.
3 Edge Focus is semi-automated by moving the stage to the proper location and
allowing the operator to determine the edge of a long and short axis of the
cartridge. The opposite long and short access does not have to be found because
of algorithms in the software. On CellTracks® Analyzer II, the operator moves
a line to the edge of the cartridge using the arrow keys of the computer keyboard.
4 CellTracks® Analyzer II does not require all the features the Nikon attachment
offers because the CellTracks® Analyzer II requires a fixed focal plane dimension
on the cartridge provided by the negative lens. The Nikon attachment allows for a
variable focal plane. The CellTracks® Analyzer II design has less lens elements
reducing the light loss of the assembly by reducing the number of optical surfaces.
5 For the APC filter, CellTracks® Analyzer II will have narrower bandpass
wavelengths to increase APC detection and reduce PE spillover. The differences
are:

J. Performance Characteristics:
All of the following performance characteristics were generated using the Veridex
CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell Kit (Epithelial). (K050245)
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy
(1) Comparison Study of New Version of Device to Predicate using Clinical
Samples
A comparison study was performed using whole blood samples collected in
CellSave® preservative tubes from cancer patients to determine circulating
cancer cell counts. The samples were obtained from thirteen geographically
dispersed sites and analysis was performed by Medical Technologists. The
study compared the CellTracks Analyzer II to the CellSpotter predicate
device. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient for 83 specimens with an
average of ≥ 1.5 circulating tumor cells was 0.9996 with a linear regression
slope of 1.136 and an r² of 0.9992.
(2) Comparison Study of New Version of Device to Predicate using Tissue
Comparison Study of New Version of Device to Predicate using Tissue
Cultured Cell-Line Samples
To directly demonstrate comparable performance between the new system and
the predicate system, a study was performed using duplicate samples split
between both the predicate device, CellSearch™ Epithelial Cell System
(K031588), and the new device, CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell System
(K050245). The study consisted of spiking normal donor whole blood
samples with three different tissue culture lines (SKBr-3, PC3-9 and MCF-7)
5

--- Page 6 ---
at three different levels (~5, ~50, and ~1000) for 5 days. The three cell lines
(SK-Br-3, MCF-7, or PC3-9) were chosen to cover a broad range of EpCAM
and Cytokeratin antigen density representing the capture and detection
portions of the assay respectively. Three spike levels of each cell line were
chosen to cover a range of potential clinical values. Of the three cell lines
tested, the PC3-9 cell line has the lowest Cytokeratin antigen density. SK-Br-
3 cells demonstrate an uneven bimodal population consisting primarily of
moderate level Cytokeratin antigen density cells and a smaller population of
higher expressing cells. MCF-7 cells demonstrate the highest level of
consistent Cytokeratin expression. The Cytokeratin antigen is the target of the
detection reagent for tumor cells in the CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell
kits. The design and execution of this study is consistent with the NCCLS
guideline EP9-A. A total of 45 samples were analyzed on each of the two
platforms
For MCF-7 cells the slope of the regression line = 1.03, an intercept of 1.5 and
an r2 = 0.994. For SKBr-3 cells, the slope of the regression line = 1.01 with
an intercept of 2.9 and an r2 = 0.984. For PC3-9 cells, the slope of the
regression line = 1.19 with an intercept of 10.5 and an r2 = 0.963. Analysis of
data from all 3 tumor cell lines combined shows a slope of the regression line
= 1.09 with an intercept of 1.5 and an r2 = 0.966.
The slope of 1.19 for PC3-9 cells may be due to an improved dynamic range
of the AutoPrep / CellTracks Analyzer II system resulting in a flattening out
of the response curve at higher cell numbers. In other words, the recovery of
CTC by the AutoPrep / CellTracks Analyzer II platform at high numbers of
cells may be somewhat more sensitive than recovery by the CellPrep /
CellSpotter platform, particularly with lower EpCAM antigen density cells as
is the case with PC3-9 cells (Figure 1). This difference could also be
attributable to increased reliability and/or stability of the AutoPrep as
compared to the CellPrep for sample preparation. Regardless of this potential
difference however, there appears to be no difference between the AutoPrep /
CellTracks Analyzer II platform and the CellPrep / CellSpotter platform at the
medical decision level of 5-50 CTC’s.
(3) EP9-A Comparison Study with SkBr-3 Tissue Culture Cells
A comparison was made of the performance of the CellTracks Analyzer II
system for the detection of tumor cells from whole blood versus the
CellSpotter® Analyzer (K031588). This method comparison was conducted
in accordance with NCCLS EP9-A, Method Comparison and Bias Estimation
Using Patient Samples, using whole blood from normal donors spiked with
tissue culture cells (SKBr-3) at tumor cell counts that cover the clinical range.
The range of tumor cells observed in this experiment was from 0 to 1960.
Linear regression analysis showed the slope of the CellTracks analyzer II
tumor cell count versus the CellSpotter analyzer cell count regression line =
1.03 with an intercept of -1.25 and an r2 = 0.9998.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
(1) System Reproducibility with CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell Control
Three separate CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell Control samples were
prepared and processed each day for over 30 days, per the long run method of
NCCLS guideline EP5-A2. Each single-use sample bottle contains a low and a
high concentration of cells from a fixed cell line that have been pre-stained
with two different fluorochromes. Summary statistics for the high and low
control cells is presented below.

c. Linearity/Recovery:
(1) Recovery Study:
Blood samples from a single healthy donor were pooled and five of six 7.5
mL aliquots were spiked with 5, 20, 81, 325 and 1300 cultured breast cancer
cells (SK-Br-3). The sixth tube was unspiked pooled blood and served as a
zero point. These samples were processed on the CellTracks® AutoPrep
System with the CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell Kit and CTC counts
were determined on the CellTracks® Analyzer II. The experiment was
repeated for four additional donors. The observed cell counts were plotted
against the results of the expected cell count. The results are summarized in
the following table.
Percent Detection Estimates.
Mean Observed
Expected Tumor Cell Tumor Cell
Count Count Range of Percent Recovery
1300 1215 91 to 95%
325 308 82 to 101%
81 85 80 to 136%
20 22 95 to 140%
5 7 120 to 200%
To determine the overall, or least squares fit, for the comparison of the
observed and expected cell counts across all the data, linear regression
analysis was performed. The regression equation for these 30 samples was
Y=0.93x + 3.87, R2=0.999. The results of this study indicate that on average
over the tested CTC range the recovery, as derived from regression analysis, is
7

[Table 1 on page 7]
	Mean Observed	
Expected Tumor Cell	Tumor Cell	
Count	Count	Range of Percent Recovery
1300	1215	91 to 95%
325	308	82 to 101%
81	85	80 to 136%
20	22	95 to 140%
5	7	120 to 200%

--- Page 8 ---
93%.
Given the linear response of the tumor cell counts, one would expect the slope
of the observed versus expected plot to be 1.0. However, the slope was 0.93.
This is because the CellTracks® AutoPrep System with CellSearch™ CTC Kit
involves the capture and fluorescent labeling of cells followed by their
detection and enumeration by the CellTracks® Analyzer II. The loss of cells
could therefore be attributed to one of the following possibilities; 1) the
recovery of only 93% of the tumor cells spiked into 7.5mL of blood by the
CellTracks® AutoPrep System, 2) the detection of only 93% of the tumor cells
present in the sample chamber by the CellTracks® Analyzer II or 3) a
combination of both of these sources of error.
(2) Linearity / Reportable Range
Another way to examine the recovery data (see above) is to analyze it as a
dilution series to evaluate test linearity. We removed the confounding
variable of percent recovery by using the observed value of the original
sample divided by the dilution factors to determine the expected values for the
dilution series for each patient sample. Regression of all of these numbers of
observed tumor cells versus the numbers of expected tumor cells yielded a
slope of 1.007, an intercept of 3.0, an r2 = 0.99 and r = 0.995. Therefore, once
the percent recovery (cell loss) was factored out of the CTC values of each of
the original samples, this analysis of the data demonstrated that the detection
of CTC was linear over the reportable range of 0 to 1238 tumor cells.
d. Carryover:
Specimens with more than 5,000 CTC per 7.5 mL of blood were less than
0.03% of those seen in our clinical studies. Sample carryover is of concern
when such a high CTC specimen is immediately followed in the CellTracks®
AutoPrep System by a specimen yielding a CTC result in the range 5 to 15
CTC per 7.5 mL of blood. In this case, we recommend obtaining a new blood
sample from the low CTC patient and performing a confirmatory CTC
analysis. To identify following samples, refer to the CellTracks® AutoPrep
User’s Guide section on View Data and obtain the detailed batch data,
including sample and patient identification for each tube in the batch.
e. Interfering Substances:
Assaying with the CellSearch™ Epithelial Cell Kit, SK-BR-3 cells spiked into
blood samples were exposed to potential interfering substances and compared
to untreated controls. Toxic levels (5 times therapeutic index) of the following
cancer drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and other exogenous substances were
tested: cyclophosphamide, Mitomycin C®, Procrit®, biotin, 5-fluorouracil,
methotrexate, tamoxifen citrate, paclitaxel, Arimidex®, acetaminophen,
acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, dextromethorphan, Aredia®, Human Anti-
Mouse Antibody (HAMA) type 1, HAMA type 2, Herceptin®, and ibuprofen.
No significant differences in SK-BR-3 cell numbers were detected, indicating
that these substances do not interfere with the CellSearch™ kit.
Samples spiked with toxic levels of doxorubicin resulted in aberrant staining
8

--- Page 9 ---
of leukocytes as cytokeratin and CD45 dual positive cells, due to the
doxorubicin being a fluorescent compound that is incorporated into nucleated
cells. If seen, the staining pattern of all cells being CD45 positive and
cytokeratin positive is obvious and easily identified by the operator as a
known interference staining profile. If blood is drawn after the recommended
7-day washout period, following doxorubicin infusion, this interference is
unlikely to be observed in clinical practice given controlled therapeutic levels
and rapid drug clearance.
Potential interference from lipemia was studied by adding Intralipid to
samples to a concentration of 2.6%, which corresponds to greater than
1000 mg/dl triglyceride. Samples were lysed to simulate total hemolysis.
Bilirubin at 7.4 mg/dL, HAMA 1/HAMA 2 and hematocrit from 18-60% were
studied. Lipemia, hemolysis, icterus and a broad range of hematocrit values do
not interfere with the CellSearch™ test. HAMA 1 and HAMA 2 also do not
interfere, indicating that individuals receiving mouse Ig by parenteral routes
can be tested successfully with the CellSearchTM test.
