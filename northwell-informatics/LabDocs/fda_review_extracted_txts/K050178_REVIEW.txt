4. Panel:
Assay – Hematology (HE)
Calibrator and Control – Chemistry (CH)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for Use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Diazyme HbA1c Enzymatic Assay is intended for the quantitative
determination of stable HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin A1c) in human whole blood
samples. Measurement of HbA1c is a valuable indicator for long term diabetic
control.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
N/A
4. Special instrument requirements:
Hitachi 717 application sheet provided
I. Device Description:
The Diazyme Hemoglobin A1c Enzymatic Assay contains reagents for the
quantitative analysis of glycated hemoglobin A1c and total hemoglobin in whole
blood. The % hemoglobin A1c is then calculated as the ratio of HbA1c to total
hemoglobin. The assay contains calibrators and controls will be available.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Tosoh Medics G7 Automated Hemoglobin A1c Assay
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
k011434

3. Comparison with predicate:
Same intended use and utility. They differ in type of test, with the predicate being
an ion exchange HPLC assay.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were referenced
L. Test Principle:
Lysed whole blood samples are subjected to extensive protease digestion. This
process releases amino acids including glycated valines from the hemoglobin beta
chains. Glycated valines then serve as a substrate for fructosyl valineoxidase (FVO)
enzyme which specifically cleaves N-terminal valines and produces hydrogen
peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide is measured using a peroxidase catalyzed reaction
and a suitable chromagen. Total hemoglobin is determined separately by conversion
of all hemoglobin derivatives of the samples into hematin using an alkaline method as
described in Zander et al (1984).
Fresh whole blood samples are treated with lysis reagent to release hemoglobin. The
same lysate is then subjected to two parallel tests. The first determines glycated
hemoglobin (GHb) content and the second test determines total hemoglobin (THb)
content of the samples. The A1c concentration is expressed as a concentration ratio
of glycated hemoglobin to total hemoglobin.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted by testing a low and high control 14 times
each for intra-assay precision and in twenty runs for inter-assay precision.
Intra-assay
Level 1 (5.3% HbA1c) Level 2 (12% HbA1c)
Mean 5.3% 11.9%
SD 0.3 0.2
CV% 3.5 1.6

--- Page 4 ---
Inter-assay
Mean 5.3% 12.04%
SD 0.3 0.9
CV% 5.0 7.2
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Six samples were prepared by dilution of a sample with a known
concentration of HbA1c of 15.7%. The diluent was a whole blood sample
with a known value of 4.2% HbA1c. The assay was determined to be linear
from 4.0 – 16.0% HbA1c.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The firm has not applied for certification by the National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program (NGSP).
Accelerated and open vial stability are provided for the reagents. Value
assignment, verification, and stability are provided for controls and calibrators
which are to be sold separately. Values are obtained by replicate analysis
using the listed manufacturer method and reagent lots available at the time of
value assignment.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity in section b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
The effects of triglycerides, bilirubin, ascorbic acid, uric acid, and glucose
were confirmed by analysis of whole blood samples spiked with 2000mg/dL
triglycerides, 10 mg/dL bilirubin, 4 mg/dL ascorbic acid, 5 mg/dL uric acid
and 2400 mg/dL glucose. The results showed <10% interference for each
substance at the levels tested.
f. Assay cut-off: N/A
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Seventy four whole blood samples ranging from 4.2%- 15.7% HbA1c were
compared to Tosoh Medics G7 HbA1c assay on the Hitachi 717. Linear
regression was y = 1.01x – 0.24, r = 0.92.
