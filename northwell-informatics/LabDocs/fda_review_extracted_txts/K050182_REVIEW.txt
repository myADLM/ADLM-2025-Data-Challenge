H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Q. STEPS Biometer G/C Dual Monitoring System is intended for use
with Q.STEPS Glucose and Cholesterol Test Strips with Q. STEPS Biometer
G/C by healthcare professionals and home users. Q. STEPS Biometer G/C
System provides a quantitative measurement of Glucose and Cholesterol in
whole blood from the fingertips. The Glucose measurements are used in
helping the management of carbohydrate metabolism disorders including
diabetes mellitus, idiopathic hypoglycemia and pancreatis islet cell tumors.
Cholesterol measurements are used in the management of disorders involving
excess cholesterol in the blood, lipid and lipoprotein metabolism disorders.
3. Special condition for use statement(s):
Provides plasma equivalent results.
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Q. STEPS Biometer G/C Dual Monitoring System.
I. Device Description:
The Q. STEPS™ Biometer G/C Dual Monitoring System uses enzymatic electrochemical
biosensor technology to measure whole blood glucose and cholesterol levels. When
finger blood is applied to the test spot of the biosensor (test strip) a reduction-oxidation
reaction occurs. The oxidase of D-Glucose or Cholesterol which is catalyzed by Glucose
Oxidase or by Cholesterol Oxidase respectively, causes an electron transfer at the
electrode (silver) surface; and therefore, the magnitude of the current produced is
proportional to the glucose or cholesterol concentration in the blood. The Biometer G/C
uses that current to quantify the glucose and the cholesterol levels in the blood, and then
display on the readout of the monitor.

L. Test Principle:
The Test Principle used by this device is enzyme electrochemical sensor technology.
Biomedix’s biosensor uses a separate disposable dry reagent strip a for glucose and
cholesterol determinations. When a drop of blood from the fingertip is applied to the half-
circle test spot on the glucose test strip or the circular test spot on the cholesterol test
strip, the reduction and oxidation reaction causes electron transfer at the electrode
surfaces. Current is generated and detected by the Q.STEPS Biometer G/C Dual
Monitoring System. The magnitude of the current generated is proportional to the analyte
concentration in the blood.

Glucose
The sponsor indicated glucose spiked venous whole blood was used to perform the
Within-Run Precision Study. Commercially purchased venous blood was pooled together
and spun down to separate the erythrocytes from plasma. The venous blood was then
adjusted to 45 ± 3% hematocrit with the plasma. Five different concentrations of glucose
spiked whole blood solutions were made by adding the concentrated glucose solution into
the whole blood. These glucose spiked whole blood samples were used for the within-run
precision study. Each sample was measured twice per day for 20 days. As shown in the
table below, the values of C.V were between 2.7% and 8.0%

Cholesterol
The specimens used in the precision study were EDTA preserved whole blood samples
that were obtained commercially. First, the whole blood samples were pooled together,
spun down and plasma removed. The serum-base cholesterol stock solutions with the
desired cholesterol level were then mixed with red blood cells to become a whole blood
sample. The cholesterol-spiked blood was prepared at four target concentrations of 190,
200, 240, and 260 mg/dL. The venous blood was then adjusted to a final hematocrit of

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Glucose
The sponsor pooled 980µl of venous blood and adjusted the hematocrit to 45% ± 3. The
pooled sample was then spiked with a Glucose stock solution resulting in blood glucose
concentrations of 25 mg/dL, 50 mg/dL, 100 mg/dL, 200 mg/dL 300 mg/dL, 400 mg/dL,
500 mg/dL, 550 mg/dL and 600 mg/dL. Each sample was then measured by the YSI
STAT PLUS analyzer, as a reference, and then 10 µl of the sample was placed on the
Q.STEPS Side Sensor Test Strip and Biometer G/C. Each concentration level of whole
blood glucose spiked solution was applied to four test strips. The average reading was
taken for the measurements.
Results
For each lot of test strips, the glucose concentration determined by the Q.STEPS
Biometer G/C was plotted against the glucose concentration determined by the YSI 2300

The sponsor spiked 15 µl of venous blood with cholesterol stock solutions resulting in
blood cholesterol concentrations of 150 mg/dL, 200 mg/dL, 240 mg/dL, 300 mg/dL and
350 mg/dL. The cholesterol concentration of each sample was first measured by the
Cobas Mira PLUS, as a reference, and then 15µl of the sample was placed on the
Q.STEPS Cholesterol Test Strip and the Biometer G/C. Each level of whole blood
cholesterol spiked solution was applied to four test strips. The average readings were
taken for the measurement of linear regression.

Cholesterol
The sponsor tested ten common endogenous or exogenous substances for cholesterol
meters. Hemoglobin was also tested due to the occurrence of hemolyzed specimens. The
sponsor utilized a Student t test for statistical analysis. Paired differences were analyzed
to determine statistically significant differences between 3 lots of cholesterol test strips.
A p value less than .05 was considered to be statistically significant. The therapeutic and
toxic concentrations of the interferents are listed in the below table.

Hematocrit Study
Glucose
The sponsor obtained venous whole blood samples that were pooled, and then spun down
to separate the red cells from the plasma. The plasma was adjusted to the desired target
hematocrit concentration levels of approximately 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 45%, 50%, and
60%. Each hematocrit level had 5 target glucose concentrations (50 mg/dL, 80 mg/dL,
120 mg/dL, 200 mg/dL and 400 mg/dL), which were prepared by spiking with
appropriate volumes of glucose stock solutions.
The sponsor’s acceptance criteria for this study was determined to be hematocrit levels
that exhibit glucose concentrations within ± 20% of that glucose reading of the same
specimen at 45% hematocrit level.

Method comparison studies were performed at three different clinical sites. The
correlation studies were made between the Biometer (k050182) new device, One
Touch (k031472) predicate device, and the YSI (reference method) utilizing finger
stick whole blood samples. The sponsor indicated that each home user performed
their own fingerstick and performed the test on the Q.STEPS Biometer G/C. The
measurement was also read by the professionals.
The professionals then performed another fingerstick on the same home user and
performed a glucose test on the same device with the same lot of test strips. All of the
results were masked from each other. The professional then tested the same user with
the One Touch and YSI methods. The comparison results are presented the table
below. The results are expressed as the mean absolute bias and regression analysis.

The lay-users performed their fingerstick and performed the cholesterol test on the
Q.STEPS Biometer G/C System and the results were recorded by the lay-user and
professional. The professional also performed a finger stick cholesterol test on the
same lay-user using the same Biometer G/C System with the same lot of test strips.
The professional from each site also drew a tube of venous blood from 14-16 lay-
users in order to send the serum to CRMLN for comparison. Comparison results are
