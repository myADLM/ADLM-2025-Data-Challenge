L. Test Principle:
The CEDIA® Tacrolimus Assay is based on β-galactosidase which has been expressed in
two inactive fragments (donor and acceptor) that can re-associate in solution to create
active enzyme. Drug in the specimen competes with tacrolimus analog that is conjugated
to the enzyme donor for anti-tacrolimus antibody binding sites (which are limited).
When antibody binds drug in the sample, the enzyme donor molecules are free to bind the
enzyme acceptor molecules to form active β-galactosidase. The active enzyme cleaves a
colorimetric substrate. The amount of active enzyme formed (and the resultant
absorbance change) is directly proportional to the amount of drug in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Assay imprecision was evaluated according to CLSI EP5-A. Three (3) whole blood
pools from patients taking tacrolimus and 3 negative whole blood pools spiked with
tacrolimus to targeted concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 ng/mL were assayed in 21 runs
over 11 days. Each pool was measured multiple times to observe 126 data points for
each pool. Results are summarized below (units = ng/mL).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The CEDIA® Tacrolimus Calibrators are ready-to-use liquid calibrators prepared in a
whole blood matrix. The calibrators contain ascomycin rather than tacrolimus.
Ascomycin is an ethyl analog of tacrolimus and differs at only one position (position 21).
The primary antibody in the CEDIA® Tacrolimus Assay is 100% reactive with both
tacrolimus and ascomycin.

Primary calibration standards are gravimetrically prepared using tacrolimus to targeted
values of 0 and 30 ng/mL. Primary standards are verified by testing multiple replicates of
each level in multiple analyzer runs. Concentrations are also independently validated
using LC-MS/MS. The kit calibrators are prepared gravimetrically from purified
ascomycin. The primary standards are used to value-assign the kit calibrators multiple
times in multiple runs. The target values for the low and high calibrators are 0 and 30
ng/mL, respectively.
Real-time and accelerated stability of the kit components was used to determine a claim
of 24 months (refrigerated reagents and frozen calibrators).
d. Detection limit:
The functional sensitivity of the assay (defined as the concentration at which interpolated
% CV is 20%) was evaluated. Patient samples containing tacrolimus were pooled and
aliquots were diluted using negative whole blood to obtain pools containing 1, 2, 3, 4,
and 5 ng/mL tacrolimus. The pools were measured in triplicate in 10 runs, and the % CV
was plotted versus tacrolimus concentration. The functional sensitivity of the assay is 2.0
ng/mL.
To determine the analytical sensitivity of the assay, 21 replicates of the low calibrator (0
ng/mL analyte) and 21 replicates of negative whole blood samples were assayed over 3
separate runs. The analytical sensitivity (calculated as 2 standard deviations above the
observed average) for the calibrator and the negative whole blood was 0.8 ng/mL and 1.2
ng/mL, respectively. The claimed analytical sensitivity, reported as the highest
concentration reading observed during the 3 runs, is 1.5 ng/mL tacrolimus.
e. Analytical specificity:
Potential interferences were evaluated by adding known amounts of exogenous and
endogenous substances to negative whole blood samples. The samples were controlled
with matched samples spiked with solvent only. Five replicates of each sample were
assayed and the % recovery was calculated. The results are summarized below.

Potential cross-reactivity with tacrolimus metabolites was evaluated by adding 20 ng/mL
of the major metabolites of tacrolimus to negative whole blood samples. Five replicates
of each sample were assayed and the cross-reactivity was calculated. The results below
indicate that the assay cross-reacts to 13-O-desmethyl tacrolimus. Therefore, results
from this assay may be slightly higher than those obtained with HPLC-MS/MS. There is
a potential bias between the two methods and the labeling will emphasize the need to
establish a clinical range for the CEDIA® Tacrolimus Assay. (units = ng/mL)

Potential cross-reactivity by other common immunosuppressants was evaluated by

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Tacrolimus concentrations were determined for trough patient samples using both the
CEDIAÒ Tacrolimus Assay and conventional high performance liquid chromatography
with mass spectrometry detection (LC-MS/MS). Samples provided for method
comparison studies were obtained post-operatively from renal and hepatic allograft
recipients. All samples were trough draws.
An internal evaluation at the sponsor’s site used samples provided by a US multi-organ
transplant center and a European medical research university hospital. Data on a portion
of those samples using the predicate deice (assay 1) was generated at the US multi-organ
transplant center.
Eternal evaluations were performed at two transplant centers in Australia and New
Zealand and in an Australian clinical laboratory. Samples originated at the two transplant
centers.
The linear regression statistics are summarized below. These results show that there is a
predictable, expected bias between the two methods; with the CEDIAÒ Tacrolimus Assay
results being somewhat higher than those obtained using LC-MS/MS. This information
will be included in the labeling with a caution that users should establish their own
reference ranges and not compare values between methods.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The recommended range of tacrolimus concentrations in whole blood for effective post-
operative management of kidney and liver allograft transplant patients is 5 ng/mL to 20
ng/mL using LC/MS. The optimal therapeutic range for tacrolimus in whole blood has
not been established with this assay.
Optimal tacrolimus concentration ranges vary according to the methodology used, and
therefore should be established for each commercial test. Values obtained with different
assay methods cannot be used interchangeably due to differences in cross-reactivity with
metabolites, nor should correction factors be applied. Laboratories should include
identification of the assay used in order to aid in interpretation of results. Tacrolimus
concentrations for individual patients should be determined using a single, consistent
method to minimize confounding effects associated with cross-reactivity and recognition
of metabolites.
The patient’s current and past clinical state, individual differences in sensitivity to
immunosuppressive and toxic effects of tacrolimus, co-administration of other
immunosuppressants, time post-transplant, and a number of other factors may cause
different requirements for optimal blood concentrations of tacrolimus. Therefore,
individual tacrolimus values cannot be used as the sole indicator for making changes in
treatment regimen and each patient should be thoroughly evaluated clinically before
changes in treatment regimens are made. Each institution should establish the optimal
ranges based on the specific assay used and other factors relevant to their patient
population.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
