L. Test Principle:
Lupus Anticoagulants (LA) has traditionally been classified as anti-phospholipid
antibodies, but a more correct view is that they are antibodies directed against plasma
proteins, which also bind to phospholipid surfaces. They are usually IgG, IgM, or
mixtures of both, and frequently interfere with standard phospholipid-dependent
coagulation tests.
SCT Screen is a low phospholipids concentration reagent to screen samples and SCT
Confirm Reagent is a high phospholipids concentration reagent to confirm specificity.
Both reagents use a calcium chloride activator solution that contains polybrene to
inhibit heparin sensitivity.
A Screen ratio is determined by dividing the patient SCT Screen result by the mean of
the SCT Screen normal range. A Confirm ratio is determined by dividing the patient
SCT Confirm result by the mean of the SCT Confirm normal range. A normalized
SCT ratio is determined by dividing the SCT Screen ratio by the SCT Confirm ratio.
A normalized SCT ration >1.24 indicates the presence of LA.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was performed on an ACL Advance (K002400) and the ACL Futura
Coagulation Analyzer (K951891) using 3 levels of controls: HemosIL
Normal Control (K021023) and GradiPlasma LA Low and High Controls
(K993332). On the ACL Advance, each control was run in duplicate twice a
day for twenty days (n=80). On the ACL Futura, each control was run in
duplicate twice a day for 10 days (n=40). Within run, between run and total
%CV was calculated per NCCLS EP5-T2 for SCT Screen, SCT Confirm and
Normalized SCT Ratio.

e. Analytical specificity: Specificity testing was performed on ACL Advance by
spiking multiple levels of each interferent (bilirubin, triglycerides, UF and
LMW Heparin) into pooled normal and low abnormal plasmas and comparing
the results against the unspiked sample results. All samples were tested in
duplicate with a single lot of HemosIL Silica Clotting Time (SCT Screen and
SCT Confirm) reagents. Results demonstrated no significant interference by
bilirubin up to 30 mg/dL, triglycerides up to 500mg/dL, and Heparin (UF and
LMW) up to 0.4 u/mL.
f. Assay cut-off:
A cut-off value of >1.24 for the SCT normalized ratio was established from
the normal range data based on a 90% CI around the 95% range in accordance
with NCCLS C28-A2.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
An in-house study was conducted using 210 patient citrated plasma samples
with the HemosIL Silica Clotting time versus the predicate HemosIL LAC
Screen/LAC Confirm on an ACL Advance. y = 1.10X-0.0860, r=0.8738
A field study was conducted using 206 patient citrated plasma samples with
the HemosIL Silica Clotting time versus the predicate HemosIL LAC
Screen/LAC Confirm on an ACL Futura. y = 1.17x - 0.2467, r=0.9211
