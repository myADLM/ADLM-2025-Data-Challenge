treatment of carbohydrate metabolism disorders including diabetes mellitus,
neonatal hypoglycemia, and idiopathic hypoglycemia, and pancreatic islet cell
tumors.
2. Indication(s) for use:
“The 3test® Glucose test strip is intended to measure the glucose in whole blood
with the 3test® Glucose Monitoring System. It is suitable for a person with
diabetes to monitor their blood glucose at home by themselves. The 3test®
Glucose Monitoring System can also be used at clinical sites by nurses or
1

professional people to test patient’s glucose level in whole blood.
NOTE:
a. the 3test is to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip
b. the 3test is not for use with neonates
c. the 3test meter is to be used with the 3test Blood Glucose Test Strip, and the
3test High and Low Glucose Control Solutions “
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
This product is intended for over-the-counter and point-of-care use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
None; this is a complete blood glucose monitoring system.
I. Device Description:
The 3test® Glucose Monitoring System consists of a hand-held blood glucose meter,
test strips, and two levels of control materials. Each lot of test strips has a code chip
containing lot-specific calibration information that the machine reads automatically.
The meter is turned on by strip insertion; the user then supplies finger-tip blood or
control solution to the strip and the meter makes an audible tone and starts the assay,
which completes in ten seconds. The meter’s software converts the results read off the
test strip into a plasma glucose concentration and displays the value on the meter’s
LCD screen. Each test strip contains three different reaction areas: after the test is
complete, the user breaks off the used reaction area with a provided tool and stores
the strip for subsequent tests.

L. Test Principle:
The test is based on the release of electrical potential after a two-step reaction where
glucose and ferricyanide, in the presence of glucose oxidase, are converted into
gluconolactone and ferrocyanide. Ferrocyanide, when electrical current is applied,
becomes ferricyanide and releases electrons; the increase in current measured after 10
seconds by the meter is proportional to the glucose concentration. As the rate of the
chemical reaction is proportional to temperature, the meter also takes the temperature
into account when calculating the glucose concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was determined at three POC (point-of-care) and three POL
(physician office laboratories) by health-care professionals. Five levels of
glucose-spiked blood (hydrolyzed overnight) were tested twenty times at each
site, covering a range between 40 mg/dL and 400 mg/dL. Within-day
precision results are shown in the table below:

Between-day precision was tested at three POC sites and three POL sites by
health-care professionals. Five levels of glucose-spiked blood (hydrolyzed
overnight) were tested 10 times per day for five days at each site, covering a
range between 50 mg/dL and 400 mg/dL. Precision was similar at both kinds
of sites, so only POC results are summarized below:

The sponsor measured the difference in blood glucose values between the
three reaction chambers on each strip by using blood samples of known value
across the measurement range. Readings were collected for each reaction
chamber on 15 strips and averaged by reaction chamber. Mean values between
the three chambers varied 2.5% - 4.0%. This met the sponsor’s acceptance
criterion of ≤ 5% difference.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Heparinized venous whole blood was allowed to glycolyze for 24 hours
before testing then aliquoted and spiked with glucose. Twenty concentrations
spanning 20 ~ 600 mg/dL were tested 8 times each by 3test (one lot of strips)
and YSI and the mean value of each aliquot was calculated. The regression
analysis showed a linear relationship between the 3test and the YSI method:
y = 1.005x + 0.851, R = 0.999.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Control solutions are prepared by gravimetrically adding glucose to the
control base solution. Value assignments for each lot of control are
determined using 20 replicates of one test strip lot read on a 3test meter over
10 days to determine mean, standard deviation, and %CV.
Real-time shelf life studies performed by the manufacturer indicate that
unopened test strips have a 20 month life-span. Once the strip container is
opened, the test strip has been shown to be stable for 3 months.
d. Detection limit:
The low and high detection limits for the 3test system have been set at 20 and
600 mg/dL glucose. Readings below or above these values will generate a
“LO” or “HI” result respectively.
e. Analytical specificity:
Assay interferents were tested in a dose-response manner following NCCLS
EP7-A guidelines. Aliquots of the blood were supplemented with glucose to a
final concentration of 100 mg/dL and measured on an YSI analyzer. The
interferent was prepared with an appropriate solvent, and spiked into the 100
mg/dL blood. A control pool was prepared by supplementing the blood with
solvent minus the interferent. A series of four to five levels that included the
maximum concentration of the substance that would be expected to be
encountered in clinical practice were used for each interferent.
The table below shows the effect of common interferents at the upper end of
normal or therapeutic levels on 3test test levels:

The meter was tested at different altitudes to assess the effect of low oxygen
levels on meter performance. No effect on performance was found when three
different levels of blood were tested up to 8800 ft. Higher elevations were not
tested. The sponsor presented data that supported using the test system
between 14oC to 40oC.
Hematocrit Effect:
The effect of sample hemoglobin variation on the 3test system was tested
experimentally by preparing samples of known hematocrit (Hct) and spiking
aliquots of these samples with three different levels of glucose. These samples
were run on the 3test and YSI; there was less than an ± 11% bias across the
claimed range of 30 ~ 55% Hct.

Not applicable.

See clinical studies section below.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. This device is indicated for use with capillary blood only. The
meter’s software adjusts the whole-blood glucose reading to a plasma-

3. Clinical studies:
Two separate clinical studies of the 3test system performance were performed.
Results are presented in the Clinical Sensitivity section below.
The consumer study was performed at three POC sites with a total of 150 lay-
users. The lay-users ranged in age, education, and were about equally divided
between males and females; type-2 diabetes was more common in the
participant groups, although not all participants have diabetes. The native
language of most of the participants was English. Each participant performed
their own fingerstick and tested their blood using the instructions in the User’s
Guide. A trained technician then performed another fingerstick and tested the
blood on the same meter. Capillary blood was collected and measured on a
YSI analyzer.
Another study was performed by two health care professionals (HCP) at three
POC and three POL sites (n = 6 HCP). Forty patient volunteers participated at
each site; six fingersticks were performed for testing on the 3test and six
capillary tubes of blood were collected for testing on the YSI analyzer.
