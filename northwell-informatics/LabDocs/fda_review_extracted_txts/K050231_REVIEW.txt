H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Elecsys CA 19-9 Immunoassay is an immunoassay for the in vitro
quantitative determination of CA 19-9 tumor associated antigen in human
serum and plasma. The assay is indicated for the serial measurement of CA
19-9 to aid in the management of patients diagnosed with cancers of the
exocrine pancreas. The test is useful as an aid in the monitoring of disease
status in those patients having confirmed pancreatic cancer who have levels of
CA 19-9 at some point in their disease process exceeding the median
concentration determined for the apparently healthy cohort. The
electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” is intended for use on the

--- Page 2 ---
Page 2 of 14
Roche Elecsys 1010/2010 and MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 (Elecsys
module) immunoassay analyzers.
The Elecsys CA 19-9 CalSet is used for calibrating the quantitative Elecsys
CA 19-9 assay on the Elecsys immunoassay systems.
2. Indication(s) for use:
As an aid in the management of patients diagnosed with cancers of the
exocrine pancreas and in monitoring of disease status in those patients having
confirmed pancreatic cancer who have levels of CA 19-9 at some point in
their disease process exceeding the median concentration determined for the
apparently healthy cohort.
3. Special condition for use statement(s):
Patients must be Lewis blood group antigen positive. Patients known to be
genotypically negative for Lewis blood group antigen are unable to produce
the CA 19-9 antigen even in the presence of malignant tissue. Phenotyping
for the presence of the Lewis blood group antigen may be insufficient to
detect true Lewis antigen negative individuals. Even patients who are
genotype positive for the Lewis antigen may produce varying levels of CA 19-
9 as the result of gene dosage effect. The device is for prescription use only.
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Use with Roche Elecsys 1010/2010 and MODULAR ANALYTICS E170
(Elecsys module) immunoassay analyzers. These systems were 510(k)
cleared under k961481.

L. Test Principle:
The Elecsys CA 19-9 Assay is a two-step sandwich immunoassay. A sample is
incubated with a biotinylated monoclonal CA 19-9 antibody and a ruthenium
complex labeled monoclonal CA 19-9 antibody. If CA 19-9 is present in the sample,
it will bind to both antibodies to form a sandwich complex. After addition of the
streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex will bind to the microparticles as the
result of interaction of biotin and streptavidine. The reaction mixture is aspirated into
a measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface
of the electrode. Unbound substances are removed with system buffer. Application

by a photomultiplier. Results are determined using a calibration curve generated by a
2 point calibration and a master curve provided with the reagent bar code.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
i. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated on Elecsys 2010 Immunoassay Analyzer by
testing 6 replicates each of two controls (CA 19-9 concentrations of 19.2
and 60.6 U/mL) and 3 patient samples (CA 19-9 concentrations of 11.1,
46.6 and 185.4 U/mL) per day for 10 days. The following table
summarized the results of the with-in run and total precision.
Sample Mean Within-run Within-run Total Total
(U/mL) SD (U/mL) %CV SD (U/mL) %CV
Control 1 19.2 0.85 4.4 0.93 4.8
Control 2 60.6 1.75 2.9 2.28 3.8
Serum 1 11.1 0.40 3.6 0.45 4.1
Serum 2 46.6 46.6 3.3 1.75 3.8
Serum 3 185.4 5.31 2.9 5.42 2.9
Additional data were provided for five human serum samples with CA 19-
9 concentrations of 36.81, 159.79, 307.47, 644.61 and 919.78 U/mL.
These samples were tested in duplicate on four Elecsys 2010 instruments
with two series per instrument. The total %CV across all instruments
ranged from 1.6% to 4.4%. Lot-to-lot comparison was performed on 5
lots with 5 control samples with the following CA 19-9 concentrations:
12.6, 16.7, 20.8, 71.7 and 196 U/mL. The %CV ranged from 1.7% to
3.5%.
ii. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated by assaying 3 serum samples containing varying
concentrations of CA 19-9 (1138.6, 866.7 and 1400.4 U/mL). Each
sample was serially diluted with sample diluent to 14 dilutions, from
undiluted to samples containing 0.6% serum. The observed results were
compared to the expected results and the percent recovery was calculated.
The percent recoveries ranged from 85.4% to 104.5%.
The assay measuring range is from 0.6 U/mL to 1000 U/mL.
iii. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
There is no known reference standard for CA 19-9. The Elecsys CA 19-9
assay was standardized against the Enzymun CA 19-9 manufactured by
Boehringer Mannheim Immunodiagnostics. The master calibrators and
secondary calibrators are prepared using human CA 19-9 spiked into
human serum matrix. Value assignment is based on the Enzymun CA 19-

9. The CalSets are assayed and compared to these standard preparations
and values are assigned. This assignment process utilizes four E170, four
Elecsys 2010 and four Elecsys 1010 analyzers. Two series of analyses are
performed on each instrument. Two-fold determinations are made for
each series.
PreciControl Tumor Marker is the control material for the Elecsys CA 19-
9. PreciControl Tumor Marker was originally cleared under k972235. A
special 510(k) will be submitted for the PreciControl Tumor Marker to
obtain clearance for the additional analyte. CA 19-9 analyte is a
constituent of the already cleared PreciControl Tumor Marker but remains
silent in the product labeling as no Elecsys CA 19-9 immunoassay is yet
available in the US.
iv. Detection limit (functional sensitivity):
The lower detection limit (LDL) was determined on the Elecsys 2010
Immunoassay Analyzer by calculating the concentration of CA 19-9 that
would give a response equal to the mean of the CA 19-9 Master Low
calibrator plus two standard deviations (SD). Three runs of 21 replicates
of the Low calibrator were performed. The results were expressed in
counts and then converted to U/mL using the slope and intercept of the
standard curve. The mean counts + 2SD were 1486, 1553 and 1530 which
were equivalent to 0.13 U/mL, 0.28 U/mL and 0.1 U/mL. The mean LDL
claim is <0.6 U/mL.
v. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous substances - Interference was determined by using natural
and spiked samples and assayed on the Elecsys 2010. Interfering
substances tested include hemoglobin, biotin, intralipid, bilirubin and
rheumatoid factor. No significant interference was observed for bilirubin
<66 mg/dL, hemoglobin <2.2 g/dL, intralipid <1500 mg/dL, biotin <100
ng/mL and rheumatoid factor ≤1500 IU/mL.
Pharmaceutical compounds – Interference was determined by spiking the
following pharmaceutical compounds into natural patient samples and
assayed on Elecsys 2010 Immunoassay Analyzer: acetylcystein (150
mg/L), ampicillin (1000 mg/L), ascorbic acid (300 mg/L), ca-dobesilate
(200 mg/L), cyclosporine (5 mg/L), cefoxitin (2500 mg/L), levodopa (20
mg/L), methyldopa (20 mg/L), metronidazole (200 mg/L), phenylbutazone
(400 mg/L), acetysalicylic acid (1000 mg/L), rifampicin (60 mg/L),
intralipid (10000 mg/L), acetaminophen (200 mg/L), ibuprofen (500
mg/L), theophyllin (100 mg/L), doxorubicin (75 mg/L). cyclophosphamid
(1000 mg/L), cisplatin (225 mg/L), 5-flourouracil (500 mg/L),
methothrexat (50 mg/L), tamoxifen (50 mg/L), mitomycin (25 mg/L),
carboplatin (1000 mg/L), etoposid (400 mg/L), flutamid (100 mg/L) and
taxol (5.5 mg/L). No interference was observed at the concentrations
tested.
Human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) - To assess interference due to
HAMA, a sample with known amount of CA 19-9 (93.5 U/mL) was

--- Page 6 ---
Page 6 of 14
spiked into serial dilutions of a sample with known HAMA concentration
(45 µg/mL) and known intrinsic concentration of CA 19-9 of 11.95 U/mL.
At all dilutions, recovery of CA 19-9 was in the range of 100 to 102%.
The same samples were likewise tested with reagents without the HAMA
inhibiting proteins and falsely elevated results corresponding to 921.7
U/mL of CA 19-9 was obtained. Another HAMA positive sample (207
U/mL) tested also gave falsely elevated CA 19-9 concentrations of 747.8
U/mL as compared to 18.5 U/mL of the same sample with HAMA
inhibiting reagents.
Cross-reactivity - Other tumor antigens (TM) was assessed for potential
cross-reactivity by testing CA 19-9 positive serum samples that were
spiked with known concentrations of TM. The samples were assayed on
the Elecsys 2010 and results were summarized below.

5. Comparison studies:
i. Method comparison with predicate device:
One thousand three hundred and fifty three serum samples were tested on
the Elecsys CA 19-9 assay and the Fujirebio CA 19-9 Assay. These
samples were collected from male and female subjects who were either
normal, with benign or malignant diseases. The CA 19-9 concentrations
of the samples ranged from 0 to 174,340 U/mL using the predicate device.
The assays were performed in singlicate for the new device and duplicate
for the predicate device. The results were analyzed by Passing-Bablok
linear regression and results are shown below. The bias observed could
likely reflect differences in technology.

Results were also analyzed for samples that were within the assay range of
the predicate device (0-240 U/mL). The cumulative slope was 0.88 (95%
CI: 0.85, 0.91) and intercept was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.32). The slope and
intercept for the malignant samples <240 U/mL were 0.87 (95% CI: 0.81,
0.93) and 1.44 (95% CI: 0.82, 2.04) respectively.
ii. Matrix comparison:
Plasma samples collected in lithium heparin, sodium heparin, NH heparin
4
and K3 EDTA were compared to matched-serum samples and analyzed
using the Elecsys CA 19-9 assay. All samples had CA 19-9
concentrations < 31 U/mL. The number of paired samples tested varied
with the anti-coagulant. Results were analyzed by Least Squares and

Serial Monitoring Analysis
Three hundred ninety-one serum samples from 95 patients with confirmed
pancreatic cancer were prospectively collected and banked at two US
clinical sites. Samples from six patients were excluded from the statistical
analysis. Four patients ((#003, #007, #014 and #026) were excluded
because all samples had zero CA 19-9 results on the predicate and test
device. These subjects were considered Lewis blood group non-secretors.
Two patients (#004 and #048) were excluded because they did not meet
the inclusion criteria. Patient #004 had primary duodenal cancer with
pancreatic involvement and Patient #048 was diagnosed with prostate
cancer in addition to the primary pancreatic cancer during the study. Of
the remaining 89 patients, 74 were Caucasians, 2 African Americans, 9
Hispanics, 1 Asian and 3 others. The mean and median age of the cohort
was 62.4y (ranged from 36y to 83.3y) and 63y respectively. The female
subjects had a mean age of 64.6y (36y to 83.3y) and median age of 67.5y
whereas the mean age of the male subjects was 60.4y (43.8y to 78.4y) and
median age 60.5y.
There were 363 samples with an average number of 4.08 observations per
patient (ranged from 1 to 13 sample pairs). The breakdown of the patient
series is summarized below.

At the time of diagnosis, 87 of the 89 patients had stage information:
14.9% were Stage I, 26.4% Stage II, 24.1% Stage III and 34.5% stage IV.
Metastases were detected in 23.1% of Stage I patients, 47.8% Stage II,
57.1% Stage III and 80% Stage IV. The average (± SD) length of time in
the study was 250 (± 338.8) days ranging from 14 days to 2013 days.

Changes in CA 19-9 concentrations and changes in disease state were
analyzed on a per-visit basis. A significant change in CA 19-9 was
defined as greater than 15% for both new and predicate devices. The
following tables show the association between CA 19-9 concentrations
and disease status for the 274 evaluable observation pairs. Concordance
results for test and predicate devices are given in tables below. The data
in the tables represent “panel” data. Since each subject brings a unique set
of visit pairs, the Genmod Procedure of SAS was used to obtain estimates
of concordance.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The normal reference range was established by testing serum samples from
403 apparently healthy subjects (200 females and 203 males) collected during
routine physician visits from 11 centers. The cohort consisted of 366
Caucasians, 18 African Americans, 16 Hispanics, 2 Asians and 1 Native
American. The mean and median age of the cohort was 56.2y (ranged from
40y to 88y) and 54.7y respectively. The female subjects had a mean age of
56y (40y to 88y) and median age of 54.3y whereas the mean age of the male
subjects was 56.5y (40y to 88y) and median age 55y. The mean ages between
the genders were not statistically different. Overall mean specimen age was
2.23y (ranged from 1.5 to 3.58y) with a median value of 1.91y. Of the 403
specimens, 96 were 3 to 3.58y old. The table below shows the CA 19-9
results analyzed by gender.

Combined 403 10.84 ± 9.9 8.23 0.0-64.49
Confidence intervals for the 5th, 90th and 95th order statistics were constructed
using a resampling technique in validated SAS-Macros (Version 8.2).
Approximate 95% confidence intervals (CI) were developed by identification
of the value of CA 19-9 at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the sampling
distribution. An estimate for the upper limit of normal (ULN) based on the
97.5% quantile is 35.07 U/mL with a 95% CI of 30.56-42.05 U/mL. Results
were comparable to that of the predicate device (36.18 U/mL, 95%CI 34.11-
41.17 U/mL). The following histogram shows the distribution of CA 19-9 in
the normal cohort.
In addition to the normal cohort, 456 serum samples from patients with benign
conditions (192 females and 264 males) and 456 from patients (232 females
and 262 males) with malignant diseases were tested. The benign disease
samples were collected from 22 centers and selection was based on presenting
symptoms, previous test results or diagnosis. The benign cohort consisted of
399 Caucasians, 48 African Americans, 8 Hispanics and 1 Asians. The
overall mean age and median age were 62y (ranged from 40y to 92y) and 63y
respectively. The female subjects had a mean age of 61.4y (40y to 88y) and
median age of 62y and the mean age of the male subjects was 62.4y (40y to
92y) and median age 63y. Overall mean specimen age was 3.09y (ranged
from 1.58 to 5.75y) with a median value of 3.17y. Of the 456 specimens, 383
were older than 3y
The specimens from malignant subjects were from 3 collection sites. The
malignant cohort consisted of 383 Caucasians, 33 African Americans, 54
Hispanics, 23 Asians and 1 other. The overall mean age and median age were
60y (ranged from 24y to 86y) and 61y respectively. The female subjects had
a mean age of 60 y (24y to 86y) and median age of 61y and the mean age of
the male subjects was 61y (25y to 86y) and median age 60y. Overall mean

The table below shows the bootstrapped 95% CI for the 95th order statistics
for the benign and malignant disease groups of the predicate and test device.
Bootstrap samples were obtained by resampling (with replacement) values of
the devices by subject. Results indicate that at the 95th order statistics, there is
no difference between the predicate and test device.
