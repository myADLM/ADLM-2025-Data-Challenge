H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell Kit is intended for the enumeration of
circulating tumor cells (CTC) of epithelial origin (CD45-, EpCAM+, and
cytokeratins 8, 18+, and/or 19+) in whole blood.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The presence of CTC in the peripheral blood, as detected by the CellSearchTM
Circulating Tumor Cell Kit, is associated with decreased progression free survival
1

--- Page 2 ---
and decreased overall survival in patients treated for metastatic breast cancer. A
CTC count of 5 or more per 7.5 mL of blood is predictive of shorter progression
free survival and overall survival.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The CellTracks® AutoPrep system and the CellTracks® Analyzer II. The
CellTracks® Analyzer II is a semi-automated fluorescence microscope intended
to enumerate fluorescently labeled cells that are immunomagnetically selected
and distributed over a viewing surface
I. Device Description:
The CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell Kit contains a ferrofluid-based capture
reagent and immunofluorescent reagents. The ferrofluid reagent consists of
nanoparticles with a magnetic core surrounded by a polymeric layer coated with
antibodies targeting the EpCAM antigen for capturing CTC. After immunomagnetic
capture and enrichment, fluorescent reagents are added for identification and
enumeration of CTC. The fluorescent reagents include the following: anti-CK-
Phycoerythrin (PE) specific for the intracellular protein cytokeratin (characteristic of
epithelial cells), DAPI which stains the cell nucleus, and anti-CD45-Allophycocyanin
(APC) specific for leukocytes
The reagent/sample mixture is dispensed by the CellTracks® AutoPrep System into a
cartridge that is inserted into a MagNest® cell presentation device. The strong
magnetic field of the MagNest® device attracts the magnetically labeled epithelial
cells to the surface of the cartridge. The CellTracks® Analyzer II or CellSpotter®
Analyzer automatically scans the entire surface of the cartridge, acquires images and
displays any event to the user where CK-PE and DAPI fluorescence are co-located.
Images are presented to the user in a gallery format for final classification. An event
is classified as a tumor cell when its morphological features are consistent with that of
a tumor cell and it exhibits the phenotype EpCAM+, CK+, DAPI+ and CD45-

All requirements for these standards were met. EP9-A testing was performed using donor
spiked samples rather than actual cancer patient samples.
L. Test Principle:
Epithelial cells are immunomagnetically labeled by targeting the Epithelial Cell
Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) antigen. Anti-EpCAM monoclonal antibodies
conjugated to ferrofluid particles are colloidal and, when mixed with a sample
containing the target epithelial cells, bind to the EpCAM antigen associated with the
epithelial cells. After immunomagnetic selection of epithelial cells from 7.5 mL of
blood, fluorescent reagents are added at this time to discriminate between the
immunomagnetically selected cells. Anti-Cytokeratin – Phycoerythrin (CK-PE)
stains the intracellular cytoskeleton cytokeratin proteins expressed in cells of
epithelial origin, anti-CD45-Allophycocyan (CD45-APC) stains leukocytes and DAPI
stains DNA present in the cell nucleus.

The processed reagent/sample mixture is dispensed by the CellTracks® AutoPrep
System into a cartridge that is inserted into a MagNest® cell presentation device. The
strong magnetic field of the MagNest® device causes the magnetically-labeled target
cells to move to the surface of the cartridge. The cartridge is then placed on the
CellTracks® Analyzer II for data acquisition and analysis. The CellTracks Analyzer
II scans the entire surface of the cartridge with a series of fluorescence filters that are
defined for a given assay and acquires images of PE, APC and DAPI fluorescence
staining of the entire viewing surface.
After data acquisition is completed, the images are analyzed for any event where
cytokeratin-PE and DAPI are within a specified space in the cartridge, i.e. indicating
the possible presence of a cell with a nucleus that expresses cytokeratin. Images from
each fluorescent color as well as a composite image of the cytokeratin staining
(green) and the nuclear staining (purple) are presented to the user in a gallery for final
cell classification. A cell is classified as a tumor cell when it its EpCAM+ (i.e., it is
captured), CK+, DAPI+ and CD45-. A check mark placed by the operator next to the
composite images classifies the event as a Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) and the
software tallies all the checked boxes to obtain the CTC count.
The sponsor’s data demonstrate that metastatic breast cancer patients with 5 or more
CTC/per 7.5 mL of blood have a significantly greater probability for shorter
progression free and overall survival than patients who have fewer than 5 CTC per
7.5 mL of blood.
This test methodology is new. It is hoped that further clinical studies reported in the
scientific literature will corroborate the clinical study performed by the sponsor for
submission to the FDA for the predicate device.

A total of 163 duplicate samples were collected from 47 patients over the course

the reproducibility of CTC measurements. The regression equation for the
7

--- Page 8 ---
comparison of these 163 duplicate samples was Y=0.98x + 0.67, R2=0.99. Table
2 shows the summary of the data for replicates where the average of the two CTC
results was <5 compared to those where the average (avg.) was >5.

Accuracy/Recovery:
Blood samples from a single healthy donor were pooled and five of six 7.5
mL aliquots were spiked with 5, 20, 81, 325 and 1300 cultured breast cancer
cells (SK-Br-3). The sixth tube was unspiked pooled blood and served as a
zero point. These samples were processed on the CellTracksâ AutoPrep
System with the CellSearchÔ Circulating Tumor Cell Kit and CTC counts
were determined on the CellTracksâ Analyzer II. The experiment was
repeated for four additional donors. The observed cell counts were plotted
against the results of the expected cell count. The results are summarized in
Table 3.
Table 3. Percent Detection Estimates.
Mean Observed
Expected Tumor Cell Tumor Cell
Count Count Range of Percent Recovery
1300 1215 91 to 95%
325 308 82 to 101%
81 85 80 to 136%
20 22 95 to 140%
5 7 120 to 200%
To determine the overall, or least squares fit, for the comparison of the
observed and expected cell counts across all the data, linear regression
analysis was performed. The regression equation for these 30 samples was
Y=0.93x + 3.87, R2=0.999. The results of this study indicate that on average
over the tested CTC range the recovery, as derived from regression analysis, is
93%.
Given the linear response of the tumor cell counts, one would expect the slope
of the observed versus expected plot to be 1.0. However, the slope was 0.93.
This is because the CellTracksâ AutoPrep System with CellSearchÔ CTC Kit
involves the capture and fluorescent labeling of cells followed by their

detection and enumeration by the CellTracksâ Analyzer II. The loss of cells
could therefore be attributed to one of the following possibilities; 1) the
recovery of only 93% of the tumor cells spiked into 7.5mL of blood by the
CellTracksâ AutoPrep System, 2) the detection of only 93% of the tumor cells
present in the sample chamber by the CellTracksâ Analyzer II or 3) a
combination of both of these sources of error.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Another way to examine the previous data is to analyze it as a dilution series
to evaluate test linearity. We removed the confounding variable of percent
recovery by using the observed value of the original sample divided by the
dilution factors to determine the expected values for the dilution series for
each patient sample. Regression of all of these numbers of observed tumor
cells versus the numbers of expected tumor cells yielded a slope of 1.007, an
intercept of 3.0, an r2 = 0.99 and r = 0.995. Therefore, once the percent
recovery (cell loss) was factored out of the CTC values of each of the original
samples, this analysis of the data demonstrated that the detection of CTC was
linear over the reportable range of 0 to 1238 tumor cells.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
No recognized reference material or method.
d. Detection limit:
One CTC per 7.5 mL can be detected by the CellTracks® Analyzer II resulting
in a limit of detection of 1 CTC in a cartridge. Linear regression shows that
on average, 93% of CTC present in a 7.5 mL blood sample are recovered
using the CellTracksÒ AutoPrep System (see Recovery section). The loss of
approximately 7% of the CTC in the sample is not sufficient to reduce the
limit of detection of 1 CTC.
e. Analytical specificity:
The CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell Kit contains a ferrofluid-based
capture reagent and immunofluorescent reagents. The ferrofluid reagent
consists of nanoparticles with a magnetic core surrounded by a polymeric
layer coated with antibodies targeting the EpCAM antigen for capturing CTC.
After immunomagnetic capture and enrichment, fluorescent reagents are
added for identification and enumeration of CTC. The fluorescent reagents
include the following: anti-CK-Phycoerythrin (PE) specific for the
intracellular protein cytokeratin (characteristic of epithelial cells), DAPI
which stains the cell nucleus, and anti-CD45-Allophycocyanin (APC) specific
for leukocytes
Interfering Substances:
SK-BR-3 cells spiked into blood samples were exposed to potential interfering
substances and compared to untreated controls. Toxic levels (5 times
therapeutic index) of the following cancer drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and
other exogenous substances were tested: cyclophosphamide, Mitomycin CÒ,
ProcritÒ, biotin, 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate, tamoxifen citrate, paclitaxel,
ArimidexÒ, acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, dextromethorphan,
ArediaÒ, Human Anti-Mouse Antibody (HAMA) type 1, HAMA type 2,
HerceptinÒ, and ibuprofen. No significant differences in SK-BR-3 cell

numbers were detected, indicating that these substances do not interfere with
the CellSearch™ kit.
Samples spiked with toxic levels of doxorubicin resulted in aberrant staining
of leukocytes as cytokeratin and CD45 dual positive cells, due to the
doxorubicin being a fluorescent compound that is incorporated into nucleated
cells. If seen, the staining pattern of all cells being CD45 positive and
cytokeratin positive is obvious and easily identified by the operator as a
known interference staining profile. If blood is drawn after the recommended
7-day washout period, following doxorubicin infusion, this interference is
unlikely to be observed in clinical practice given controlled therapeutic levels
and rapid drug clearance.
Potential interference from lipemia was studied by adding Intralipid to
samples to a concentration of 2.6%, which corresponds to greater than
1000 mg/dl triglyceride. Samples were lysed to simulate total hemolysis.
Bilirubin at 7.4 mg/dL, HAMA 1/HAMA 2 and hematocrit from 18-60% were
studied. Lipemia, hemolysis, icterus and a broad range of hematocrit values do
not interfere with the CellSearch™ test. HAMA 1 and HAMA 2 also do not
interfere, indicating that individuals receiving mouse Ig by parenteral routes
can be tested successfully with the CellSearchTM test.
f. Assay cut-off:
Results are reported as the number of CTC / 7.5 mL of blood. A CTC count of
5 or more per 7.5 mL of blood is predictive of shorter progression free
survival and overall survival. This cut-off was established in the 510(k) of the
previous version of this assay, the predicate device, K031588.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To demonstrate comparable performance between the new assay and the
predicate system, a study was performed using duplicate samples split
between both the predicate device, CellSearch™ Epithelial Cell System
(K031588), and the new device, CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell System
(K050245). The study consisted of spiking normal donor whole blood
samples with three different tissue culture lines (SKBr-3, PC3-9 and MCF-7)
at three different levels (~5, ~50, and ~1000) for 5 days. The three cell lines
(SK-Br-3, MCF-7, or PC3-9) were chosen to cover a broad range of EpCAM
and Cytokeratin antigen density representing the capture and detection
portions of the assay respectively. Three spike levels of each cell line were
chosen to cover a range of potential clinical values. Of the three cell lines
tested, the PC3-9 cell line has the lowest Cytokeratin antigen density. SK-Br-
3 cells demonstrate an uneven bimodal population consisting primarily of
moderate level Cytokeratin antigen density cells and a smaller population of
higher expressing cells. MCF-7 cells demonstrate the highest level of
consistent Cytokeratin expression. The Cytokeratin antigen is the target of the
detection reagent for tumor cells in the CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell
kits. The design and execution of this study is consistent with the NCCLS
guideline EP9-A. A total of 45 samples were analyzed on each of the two
platforms

For MCF-7 cells the slope of the regression line = 1.03, an intercept of 1.5 and
an r2 = 0.994. For SKBr-3 cells, the slope of the regression line = 1.01 with
an intercept of 2.9 and an r2 = 0.984. For PC3-9 cells, the slope of the
regression line = 1.19 with an intercept of 10.5 and an r2 = 0.963. Analysis of
data from all 3 tumor cell lines combined shows a slope of the regression line
= 1.09 with an intercept of 1.5 and an r2 = 0.966.
The slope of 1.19 for PC3-9 cells may be due to an improved dynamic range
of the AutoPrep / CellTracks Analyzer II system resulting in a flattening out
of the response curve at higher cell numbers. In other words, the recovery of
CTC by the AutoPrep / CellTracks Analyzer II platform at high numbers of
cells may be somewhat more sensitive than recovery by the CellPrep /
CellSpotter platform, particularly with lower EpCAM antigen density cells as
is the case with PC3-9 cells (Figure 1). This difference could also be
attributable to increased reliability and/or stability of the AutoPrep as
compared to the CellPrep for sample preparation. Regardless of this potential
difference however, there appears to be no difference between the AutoPrep /
CellTracks Analyzer II platform and the CellPrep / CellSpotter platform at the
medical decision level of 5-50 CTC’s.
b. Matrix comparison:
Since whole blood is the only matrix for this test., no matrix comparison
studies were performed.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
All of the above new analytical studies with the CellSearch™ Circulating Cell Kit/
AutoPrep/CellTracks® Analyzer II system demonstrate that the detection of tumor cells
by the CellSearch™ Circulating Cell Kit/ AutoPrep/CellTracks® Analyzer II system is
substantially equivalent to the predicate system. Therefore, the following clinical data
generated using the predicate system (K035188) is applicable to the new device
(K050245).
Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients
A multi-center prospective, longitudinal clinical trial was conducted. Results were used
to determine whether the number of CTC predict disease progression and survival.
Patients with measurable disease and who were starting a new line of therapy were
enrolled (N=177). Clinical data were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis.

Baseline CTC count was determined prior to initiation of a new line of therapy. A first
follow-up CTC count was determined after the initiation of therapy. For the baseline
analyses, Progression Free Survival (PFS) was measured from the time of the baseline
blood draw to the diagnosis of progression by CT scans and/or clinical signs and
symptoms, and Overall Survival (OS) was measured from the time of baseline blood
draw to the time of death. For the first follow-up analyses, PFS was measured from the
time of 1st follow-up blood draw (mean 4.5 + 2.4 weeks following enrollment) to
diagnosis of progression or death, and OS was measured from the time of 1st follow-up
blood draw to the time of death.
Progression Free Survival (PFS) Analysis
PFS Using Baseline CTC Results
All 177 patients had a baseline CTC test performed. For Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients
were segmented into two groups based upon their CTC count at baseline:
· The Favorable group (N=90), represented in green, consisted of patients with <5
CTC.
· The Unfavorable group (N=87), represented in red, consisted of patients with >5
CTC.
Median PFS was 30.3 weeks (~7.0 months) for the Favorable group and 11.7 weeks (~2.7
months) for the Unfavorable group. The difference in PFS between the two groups is
highly significant (Log-rank p=0.0001, Cox Hazards Ratio=1.9547, chi-square=15.33, p
= 0.0001). These results are illustrated in Figure 1.
