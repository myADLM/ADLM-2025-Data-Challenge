510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
K050265
B. Purpose for Submission:
New instrument
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
CHRONO-LOG Corporation, Model 700 Whole Blood Lumi-Aggregometer
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Platelet Function Assays: Collagen, ADP, Arachidonic Acid, Epinephrine, Ristocetin,
Thrombin
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Chrono-log Model 700 aggregometer measures platelet function on patient
samples using electrical impedance in whole blood or optical density in plasma. The
Model 700 Aggregometer has the capability to simultaneously measure ATP release
with either method using luminescence. The 700 Aggregometer is also used to run
the Ristocetin Cofactor Assay which is used to diagnose patients with von
Willebrands disease. The instrument comes with a starter kit consisting of the
following Chrono-log reagents and supplies: ADP, Arachondic Acid, Collagen,
Epinephrine, Ristocetin, Thrombin, a CHRONO-LUME kit, a Ristocetin Cofactor
Kit, cuvettes, stir bars and pipettes. The output of the Model 700 can be connected to
either a strip chart recorder or to a computer. Software is provided for computer
interface option. The computer interface option is used to collect data only. The
computer is not used for diagnosis or treatment and does not have any control over or
input into the Model 700 Aggregometer.
2. Principles of Operation:
The Chrono-log Model 700 measures platelet aggregation either photometrically
using Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) or by measuring change in electrical impedance in
whole blood. The rate and the degree of aggregation are plotted using a recording
device. Platelet aggregation in vitro is dependent on calcium ions. The Chrono-log

Model 700 utilizes two methods, Impedance and Luminescence.
Impedance Method (or electrical resistance) method of aggregation is non-optical.
An electrode probe assembly is inserted into a cuvette containing a whole blood test
sample. This method for measuring platelets aggregation allows the study of platelets
in the more physiologic whole blood environment.
Luminescence Method: ATP release is measured by a luminescence technique in
PRP or whole blood. The principle of the Lumi-Aggregometer is to measure
secretion by a sensitive luminescent assay for extra-cellular ATP in combination with
the simultaneous measurement of aggregation.
3. Modes of Operation:
Semi-Automated. The output of the Model 700 can be connected to either a strip
chart recorder or to a computer. Software is provided for computer interface option.
The computer interface option is used to collect data only.
4. Specimen Identification:
When using the ACCRO/LINK, a new file is generated for each patient with name,
identification (file name) and date at the beginning of each new run.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
(1 or 2) 4.5 ml Whole blood with 3.2% or 3.8% sodium citrate at room
temperature.
(5) 4.5 ml blue top tube for PRP at room temperature
An EDTA blood specimen must be collected from the patient for hematocrit and
platelet count.
Plastic or non-contact surfaced (siliconized) materials should be used throughout
in order to minimize activation of the platelets during sample preparation.
Testing can be performed up to 3 hours after venipuncture
6. Calibration:
Impedance: Set Baseline Button automatically sets Zero Baseline and Gain
Luminescence: Baseline is set automatically. Calibrate ATP Secretion with a 2
nM ATP Standard

7. Quality Control:
A drug free normal control whenever reagents are reconstituted or thawed. This
result should be within laboratory established values.
Positive controls can be provided by collecting samples from aspirin volunteers
and previously diagnosed patients with platelet disorders or by adding aspirin to
depleted plasma to a final concentration of 1 mM aspirin in citrated blood.
