c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
The stability performance was determined by performing analysis on
controls (normal and abnormal levels) over real time for 20 months.
(Assigned expiration date of 20 months.)
The control recovery shall be within +/- 10% of the established mean
value.
Open vial stability was established on board the analyzer to support a
30 day claim.
d. Detection limit:
The lower limit of detection was determined by injecting deionized
water 10 times. A mean was determined and the standard deviation
(SD) was calculated. From this determination, a 3 SD was calculated
and then this value was added to the mean value. The final calculated
value was defined as the lower limit of detection as performed above
and the lower concentration measured multiple times in the linearity
study.
The upper range of the assays was determined by looking at the
graphical representation of the analyte concentration versus its dilution
level. Looking at the graph and observing where the "line" breaks (is
non-linear) is the point at which the cut-off is determined.
e. Analytical specificity:
No interference was observed by ascorbic acid up to 30 mg/dL,
hemoglobin up to 500 mg/dL, and lipemia up to 2000 mg/dL
triglycerides when measured using a triglyceride concentrate and up to
1000 mg/dL when measured using Intralipid. An extensive list of drugs
or other agents interfering with bilirubin methodologies has been
reported by Young et al.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable

Comparison of serum vs. plasma was carried out with 11 true and 8
spiked human samples (n=19) spanning the range of 0.3 to 11 mg/dL.
