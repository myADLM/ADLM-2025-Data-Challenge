The HemosIL D-Dimer Kit consists of: Latex Reagent, 4 vials x 3 mL of a
lyophilized suspension of polystyrene latex particles coated with a mouse monoclonal
antibody (MA-8D3) directed against D-Dimer containing bovine serum albumin,
buffer, stabilizers and preservative; Reaction Buffer, 3 vials x 9 mL of phosphate
buffer containing bovine serum albumin, stabilizers and preservative; D-Dimer
Calibrator, 2 vials x 1 mL of a lyophilized solution of D-Dimer partially purified from
human fibrin digested with human plasmin containing bovine serum albumin, buffer,
stabilizers and preservative.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Not applicable.
L. Test Principle:
The HemosIL D-Dimer Latex Reagent is a suspension of latex particles coated with a
monoclonal antibody specific for the D-Dimer domain included in fibrin soluble
derivatives. When plasma containing D-Dimer is mixed with the D-Dimer Latex
Reagent and Reaction Buffer, the coated latex particles agglutinate. The degree of
agglutination is directly proportional to the concentration of
D-Dimer in the sample and is determined by measuring the decrease of the
transmitted light caused by the aggregates (turbidimetric immunoassay).

Not applicable for purpose of this submission. See data provided in previously
510(k) cleared predicate (K972696).
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
An outcome study was performed on 300 frozen samples from patients
4

--- Page 5 ---
admitted consecutively to an emergency unit with suspected PE or DVT
(frequency of venous thromboembolic disease : 26%). Of the 300 samples, 78
were confirmed as VTE positive (47 PE and 31 DVT) by standard objective
tests and the remaining 222 were confirmed as negative. Samples with
insrument error results were not included in calculations.
The result are as follows (based on a cut-off of 230 ng/mL) :
Instrument N Sensitivity Specificity Negative
System (96% CI) (95% CI) Predicitive
Value
ACL 297 100% 38% 100%
8000/9000/10000 (95.2%-100%) (31.4%-44.6%) (95.7%-100%)
ACL TOP 294 100% 36% 100%
(95.1%-100%) (29.6%-42.6%) (95.4%-100%)
b. Clinical specificity:
Refer to table above (3.a.).
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Refer to predicate (K972696) for normal range results for the ACL Family, and
ACL Futura/ ACL Advance Systems.
Data was provided for a comprehensive normal range study on the ACL TOP
System and the resultant data was used to update the product insert. However, the
insert states that each laboratory should establish its own normal range.
The results of the normal range study are as follows:
95% Limit 90%CI
Lower 61.4 53.3 to 69.4
Upper 231.9 223.8 to 239.9
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
