c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
The stability performance was determined by performing analysis on
controls (normal and abnormal levels) over real time for 13 months.
(Assigned expiry date of 13 months.)
The control recovery shall be within +/- 10% of the established mean
value.

Reagent is stabile for 13 months when stored at 2-8 oC.
Open vial stability was established at two levels (1 and 7 mg/dL), and
supports a 30 day open vial stability claim at 2-8 oC.
d. Detection limit:
Deionized water was injected 10 times. Samples were run on a Roche
Hitachi 717. A mean was determined and the standard deviation (SD)
was calculated. From this determination, a 3 SD was calculated and
then this value was added to the mean value. The final calculated
value was defined as the lower limit of detection.

The upper range cut off value was determined by looking at the
graphical representation of the analyte concentration versus its dilution
level. Looking at the graph and observing where the "line" breaks (is
non-linear) is the point at which the cut-off is determined.
e. Analytical specificity:
Specification – Within ± 10% from the Creatinine result recovered at
0 mg/dL.
Bilirubin Conjugate – no effect up to 32 mg/dL
Bilirubin Free – no effect up to 40 mg/dL
Hemoglobin – No effect up to 500 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid – no effect up to 200 mg/dL
e. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable

r=0.9991.
Urine Creatinine correlation determination of the Stanbio Inc
Creatinine(y) and the predicate device (x) was performed by using 37
