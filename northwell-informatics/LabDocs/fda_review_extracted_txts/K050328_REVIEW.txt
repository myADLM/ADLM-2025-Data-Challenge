H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Biochemical Diagnostics, Inc. Pregnancy-Skreen™ controls are controls
intended to validate the performance of qualitative hCG methods. They should be
treated as any “unknown” specimen while following the specific protocol of the
assay being used. This product is intended to be used by healthcare professionals
as an integral part of good laboratory practices.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
No traceability indicated.
Chorionic Gonadotropin human is a purchased product which has a known
concentration. To produce the positive control a calculation is performed by
Biochemical to determine the amount of product needed to spike negative
urine to obtain a target range between 200 and 400 mIU and tested by
radioimmunoassay. Subsequent testing is performed qualitatively.
New lots of material are run against released lots as well as against other
existing controls in the market. Aliquots are stored at room and refrigerator
temperature. Testing is performed on day one and day 31. Room temperature
samples are used to check for cloudiness that would occur if the batch is
contamination or not properly preserved. Upon acceptance of the master batch
the control is dispensed into vials and sampled according to GMP.
Stability:
Real time stability studies have been conducted. Protocols and acceptance
criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The stability is listed
below:
Open vial stability is 31 days at 18-25ºC or 2-8ºC
Closed vial stability is two years at 2-8º or 31 days at 18-25ºC
