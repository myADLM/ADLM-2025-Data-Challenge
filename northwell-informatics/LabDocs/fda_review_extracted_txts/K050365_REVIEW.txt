L. Test Principle:
Protein C is an anticoagulant protein, which is dependant on Vitamin K. It inhibits
and regulates coagulation through the specific cleavage of factors Va and VIIIa,
suppressing their procoagulant cofactor activity.
Protein C in human plasma is measured following specific activation using Protac®,
an enzyme extracted from snake venom (Agkistrodon C Contortrix). The activated
protein C (APC) then specifically cleaves the specific substrate SaPC-21, releasing

para-nitroaniline (pNA). The release of para-nitroaniline produces color, which is
measured at 405nm. There is direct relationship between release of par-nitroaniline
and the protein C activity in the tested plasma.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was performed on Protein C concentrations of 98%,
59% and 39%. The results are as follows:
Mean Intra-assay (CV %) Mean Inter-Assay (CV %)
Activity Activity
98% 0.37% (n=9) 98% 1.26% (n=12)
59% 1.17% (n=10) 59% 1.97% (n=12
39% 0.84% (n=10) 30% 1.51% (n=12)
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was determined using the Protein C calibrator with values of 0, 20,
40, 60, and 100 % activity. The linear regression results for two lots of
Biophen Protein C reagent are as follows:
r2 = 0.996 y = 0.009x + 0.022
r2 = 0.999 y = 0.081x + 0.056
The highest reportable value is 100 %.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability studies were performed on Protac (R1) and SaPC-21 substrate (R2)
vials stored at room temperature (18-25oC) or at 2-8oC, reconstituted. The
activity was tested, after storage periods of 1-4 weeks. In addition, they were
tested at 3 and 7 months. This study determined that reconstituted R1 and R2
reagents are stable: 3 days at room temperature (18-25oC), 3 months at 2-8oC.
d. Detection limit:
Threshold detection testing was performed using two lots of reagent. The limit
of detection was determined to be 5% activity.
e. Analytical specificity:
Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Comparison studies using the Biophen Protein C assay and the predicate
device were performed at two sites with patient samples presented for Protein
C testing. The results are as follows:
Site 1 r2 = 0.99 y = 1.00x + 0.84 n = 21
Site 2 r2 = 0.99 y = 0.95x + 7.9 n = 17
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected range was established in the literature. The 100% Protein C
concentration corresponds to the concentration in a normal human citrate plasma
pool, obtained by pooling plasma from healthy males or females aged from 18 to
55 years, and out of any medication. The Protein C concentration in adults is
usually between 70 and 140%.
