settings. SURE-SCREEN is not for over-the-counter sale.
Operators that may use this device are defined as individuals with a minimum of a
high school education with no formal laboratory training or experience.
Individuals should also satisfy the following training and certification guidelines:
(1)Training should be conducted by a qualified professional and include a
demonstration of the SURE-SCREEN test system and (2) the use of quality
assurance samples for monitoring and confirming the performance of the test
system. Trainers should observe and confirm that the operator (3) uses proper
technique when running a test sample and quality assurance samples, (4) has a
basic understanding of test results, including a the potential for false positive and
false negative results, (5) knows how to prepare a sample for shipment to the
laboratory for confirmation testing, (6) has reviewed the information contained in

interpretation of drug testing results.
Sure-Screen detects drug classes at the following cutoff concentrations:
(AMP) Amphetamines (d-Amphetamine) 300 ng/mL
(BZO) Benzodiazepines (Nordiazepam) 200 ng/mL
(COC) Cocaine (Benzoylecgonine) 100 ng/mL
(MAMP) Methamphetamine (d-Methamphetamine) 300 ng/mL
(MTD) Methadone (Methadone) 200 ng/mL
(OPI) Opiates (Morphine) 100 ng/mL
(PCP) Phencyclidine (Phencyclidine) 25 ng/mL
9
(THC) Cannabinoids (11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ -THC) 40 ng/mL
Many of the cutoff concentrations for these tests are below those recommended
by SAMHSA. Additionally, many of these tests are positive at levels significantly
below the claimed cutoff concentration. The rate of false positive results with
tests having sensitivities this low has not been studied. However, the rate of false
positives generally increases as the cutoff concentration of the test is lowered. See
the Precision/Sensitivity section for more information.
The SURE-SCREEN drugs of abuse test system provides only a preliminary
analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in
order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry (GC/MS) or liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry
(LC/MS/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result.
It is the responsibility of those organizations required to follow Department of
Transportation (DOT) or Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration
(SAMHSA) Workplace Drug Testing Guidelines to determine that use of this
product satisfies the criteria for workplace testing established under DOT and
SAMHSA authority.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The device is for in vitro diagnostic prescription use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable. The device is a visually read single-use device.
I. Device Description:
The device consists of a single-use test cup with a specialized lid. The lid contains
individual test strips for each of the drugs being tested. When the cup is tipped, the
urine comes into contact with the bottom of each test strip, thereby initiating the
3

--- Page 4 ---
reaction. Users determine the result by visually determining the presence or absence
of a line. Each strip includes an internal process control.
This device is a one-step immunochromatographic test intended for the detection of
amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cocaine, methamphetamine/MDMA, methadone,
opiates, phencyclidine and cannabinoids in human urine. The principle of the test
relies upon the competitive binding of unbound drug and drug bound to protein
(applied as a test line on the nitrocellulose) with the specific antibody (absorbed to
colloidal gold) targeted to the drug.
The device includes adulteration checks, the Lateral Flow Adulterant Strip, or LFAS.
There is also a temperature check on the cup. Because these are not medical devices,
they are not included in the review and do not appear in the indications for use.
The sponsor indicates the test does not contain any human source material.
The training guide and certification, including a 17 question quiz is included with the
submission.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
PROFILE II and PROFILE-ER
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
k982211 and k002331
3. Comparison with predicate:
Both devices are qualitative immunochromatographic visually read single-use
tests for measurement of the same analyte(s) in the same matrix. Both are
competitive immunoassays.
The cutoff concentrations vary, with the candidate device having lower cutoffs in
all but one of the assays, i.e., PCP. The candidate device has also been modified
to a cup-type configuration.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
The sponsor did not reference any guidance documents or standards.

L. Test Principle:
Each test strip contains antibody colloidal gold, a drug conjugate and a control line.
Mouse monoclonal antibodies are mixed with colloidal gold and applied to the
sample well pads of the strip. Drug is conjugated to protein and immobilized at the
test line. Strips have an anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody immobilized at the
control line. The anti-mouse antibody binds the mouse antibodies coated on the
colloidal gold.
When the test cup is tipped over, urine flows into the sample well of the device, the
dried antibody-colloidal gold on the sample pad dissolves and the urine wicks up the
white test strips carrying the red antibody-colloidal gold with it.
Interpretation of Results
Negative: When no drug is present in the urine sample, the red antibody-colloidal
gold migrates up the test strip and binds to the drug conjugate immobilized on the
membrane. The binding of the antibody-colloidal gold to the drug conjugate generates
a line at the test line.
Non-negative: When a drug is present in the sample the antibody-colloidal gold
binds the drug before it migrates up the test strip. However, when the antibody-
colloidal gold binds the drug in the urine, the antibody-colloidal gold can not bind to
the drug conjugate immobilized on the test strip. When the drug concentrating is at or
above the cutoff concentration, the majority of the antibody colloidal gold is bound to
the drug from the urine. Therefore, as drug bound antibody-colloidal gold migrates up
the test strip it is unable to bind to the drug conjugate immobilized on the membrane.
Therefore no line is generated at the “T” location on the device.
Control Line: Each test strip has an internal procedural control. A control line forms
when the antibody-colloidal gold binds to the anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody
immobilized on the membrane at the “C” location on the device. A line must form at
the control “C” location on the device to indicate that there was an adequate volume
of sample, the reagents migrated properly, and that the test strip is intact.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Performance around the cutoff concentration for each drug was evaluated by
testing drug-free urines spiked with standard solutions. Drug-free urines were
also tested. Testing was performed in triplicate on 5 different occasions by 3
Medtox employees. Results were read at five minutes.

Data from this study is pooled and presented, below. There were significant
differences between results read by different operators. However, most often this
occurred below the claimed cutoff concentration, and may not be as significant.
Many positive results are observed significantly below the cutoff concentration.
There are also negative results occurring at and above the cutoff. The sponsor has
no explanation for these inconsistencies other than operator error.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. The assay is intended for qualitative use.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor did not indicate any degree of traceability for their devices.
Control materials are required but are not specifically identified in the
labeling.
No calibrators are required. The device is calibrated during the
manufacturing process.
Product Stability:
Stability studies depend on readouts from an instrument (BioDot ). The
BioDot reader takes a picture of a test line, and converts it to a number
which is proportional to the line intensity. Readings less that 0.6 are
typically read as positive (absence of a line) and those above 1.1 are
typically read as negative (a line is present). Those between 0.6 and 1.1
are visually interpreted as borderline results. The sponsor provided the
following in support of these conclusions.
Artificial Test Strips were used to simulate lines on a test strip. Numerous
Test Strips were read by 29 operators. The BioDot range of readings are
compared to the visual observations of the readers.

Stability Protocol:
Drug tests are stored at 2 - 8°C and room temperature.
Drug tests are assayed at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 25 months intervals.
Twenty samples are run on each of three different lots of each of each
drug test.
The twenty replicates consist of the following:
Ø 5 replicates of a positive urine (containing drug at a
concentration of 50% above the cutoff)
Ø 15 replicates of a drug-free urine
Readings are recorded and averaged for each lot.

Acceptance Criteria for the Study:
Drug-free urine should have a BioDot reading of 2.5 reading or greater.
Individual test line intensities should be 2.0 or greater.
Urine spiked with drug 50% above the cutoff should have an average
BioDot test line intensity of 0.6 or less. Individual test line intensities
should be 0.8 or less.
Calculations used to estimate shelf life are:
At 20K Cal/mole; 12 months (365 days) at 25° C is equivalent to 44 days
at 45°C; 15 months at 25° C is equivalent to 55 days at 45°C. 24 months at
25°C is equivalent to 88 days at 45°C.
Users are instructed to follow federal, state, and local guidelines
concerning QC practices.
d. Detection limit:
Sensitivity of qualitative assays may be characterized by validating
performance around the claimed cutoff concentration of the assay, and
demonstrating the lowest concentration of drug that is capable of or
consistently producing a positive result. This information appears in the
precision section, above.
Most tests render positive results well below the claimed cutoff
concentration.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-Reactivity
The following metabolites and compounds were initially dissolved in appropriate
solvents and then added at varying concentrations to drug-free urine for evaluation.
Samples were evaluated in triplicate by in-house operators. Results are expressed as the
minimum concentration of metabolite or compound required to produce a positive test
result. Percent cross reactivity of a compound is calculated by dividing the cutoff
concentration by the minimum concentration required to obtain a positive result and then
multiplying by 100%.

Interference
pH and Specific Gravity:
All tests were assayed with six negative clinical samples with pH values of 4.0, 5.0, 6.0,
7.0, 8.0 and 9.0 ± 0.1. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. All results were negative.
The affects of these conditions on samples containing drug is not known.
Similarly, all tests were assayed with drug-free urines with specific gravity values of
1.003, 1.005, 1.011, 1.016, 1.019, 1025 and 1.033. Each sample was assayed in triplicate.
All samples were negative. The affects of these conditions on samples containing drug is
not known.
Common Drugs:
Drug free urine samples were spiked with the Sure-Screen targeted drugs to the
concentrations of 25% and 150% of the cutoff concentrations. 100 µg/mL of the
common drugs listed below, were then added to the preparation and assayed. Evaluations
were performed in triplicate by in-house operators. None of the common drugs listed in
the following table affected the expected results.
COMMON DRUGS EVALUATED WITH ALL SURE-SCREEN TESTS
Acetylsalicylic Acid Chlorpheniramine Ibuprofen
Acetaminophen Cocaine-COC Morphine-OPI
Brompheniramine maleate Doxylamine Phenobarbital
Caffeine Dextromethorphan d-Pseudoephedrine
Carbamazepine Diphenylhydantoin Salicylic Acid
There is the possibility that other substances and/or factors not listed above may
interfere with the test and cause false results, e.g., technical or procedural errors.

f. Assay cut-off:
The PCP cutoff concentration is consistent with the cutoff currently
recommended by SAMHSA. However, the cutoff concentrations for
amphetamines, cocaine, methamphetamines, opiates, and THC are below
those recommended by SAMHSA. There are currently no
recommendations for the rest of the tests.
There has been no evaluation of false positive rates using these cutoff
concentrations. The sponsor has, however, included the following
information in their package insert:
A positive test result does not always mean a person took illegal drugs and a
negative test result does not always mean a person did not take illegal drugs. There
are a number of factors that influence the reliability of drug tests. Certain drug of
abuse tests are more accurate than others.
For Preliminary Positive Tests: In general, the Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) reports the accuracy of drug tests asa:
60 out of 100 times a “preliminary positive” result from an opiate test is a “false
preliminary positive” result. This means that the result of the first test was
“preliminary positive” even though the person did not take an illegal drug.
50 out of 100 times a “preliminary positive” test result from an amphetamine or
methamphetamine test is a “false preliminary positive” result.
50 out of 100 times a “preliminary positive” result from a PCP (phencyclidine)
test is a “false preliminary positive” result.
10 out of 100 times a “preliminary positive” result from a marijuana test is a
“false preliminary positive” result.
2 out of 100 times a “preliminary positive” result from a cocaine test is a “false
preliminary positive” result.
a Data was generated from laboratory tests that have the following cutoff
concentrations: Marijuana, 50 ng/mL; Cocaine, 300 ng/mL; Phencyclidine, 25
ng/mL; Opiates, 2000 ng/mL; Amphetamines, 1000 ng/mL. In general, the rates of
false preliminary positive results will increase as the cutoff concentration of the test
is lowered.
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the
claimed cutoff concentration appears in the precision section (M,1, a),
above.
2. Comparison studies:

Performance was evaluated by assaying a panel of blind coded clinical urine samples
containing varying concentrations of drugs with Sure-Screen. Results were then

“preliminary positive” even though the person did not take an illegal drug.
50 out of 100 times a “preliminary positive” test result from an amphetamine or

50 out of 100 times a “preliminary positive” result from a PCP (phencyclidine)

10 out of 100 times a “preliminary positive” result from a marijuana test is a
“false preliminary positive” result.
2 out of 100 times a “preliminary positive” result from a cocaine test is a “false
preliminary positive” result.

compared to GC/MS or LC/MS/MS results. Samples were obtained from MEDTOX
Laboratories. There were screened using a commercial immunoassay having traditional
cutoff concentrations, i.e., significantly higher than Sure-Screen cutoff concentrations
(except for PCP). Samples with negative results by both the commercial immunoassay
system and Sure-Screen were not confirmed. Samples with positive results by either the
commercial immunoassay system or Sure-Screen were confirmed by GC/MS or
LC/MS/MS. Most samples were unaltered clinical samples, however, to include samples
with concentrations close to the cutoff 6 BZO samples were diluted with negative urine.
Testing was performed by MEDTOX personnel. Readings were taken at 5 minutes.

POC Studies
Performance was also evaluated by 13 POC staff at 44 POC locations. Operators ran
1000 blinded samples obtained from MEDTOX Laboratories. Sure-Screen test results
were compared to GC/MS or LC/MS/MS results. Operators were provided with
instructions from the package insert. Almost all operators had no formal laboratory
training, but 88% of the operators had run point-of-care testing devices prior to this study.
26/44 operators had greater than a high school education.
Samples were selected similarly to how samples were selected for the in-house study,
however this study included a high number of negative samples, and a much lower

Not applicable. Clinical studies are not typically submitted for this device
type and matrix.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable. Clinical studies are not typically submitted for this device
type and matrix. The specificity is likely to be less than traditional assays,
however, as the cutoff concentrations are significantly lower.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
4. Clinical cut-off:
Validation of the clinical appropriateness of the cutoff is not typically submitted
for this device type and matrix.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
No elicit drugs should be present in urine. Legitimate over-the-counter and
prescription drugs may cause positive results.
N. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
The device also includes tests for detected adulteration of the sample. Because these
products are not medical devices, aspects related to this claim were not reviewed.
References to the adulteration checks are therefore not included in the intended use
statement, but appear in the package insert.
O. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
P. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
