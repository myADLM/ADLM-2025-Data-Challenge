H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is intended for in vitro
quantitative determination of antimicrobial susceptibility by minimal inhibitory
concentration (MIC) of gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria
belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae and non – Enterobacteriaceae and
most gram-positive bacteria isolates from pure culture belonging to the genera
Staphylococcus and Enterococcus.
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is intended for the in vitro
rapid identification (ID) and quantitative determination of antimicrobial
susceptibility by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of gram-positive aerobic
and facultative anaerobic bacteria belonging to the genera Staphylococcus and
Enterococcus.
2. Indication(s) for use:
This submission is for the addition of the antibiotic cephalothin at concentrations
of 0.5 – 64 μg/mL to the gram positive susceptibility panel for testing
Staphylococcus spp.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST
Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and
equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™
Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST broth, which contains an AST
indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST broth is a cation-adjusted formulation
of Mueller-Hinton broth containing 0.01% Tween 80. After adding the indicator solution
to the AST inoculum the color is blue and after inoculation and incubation goes to pink to
colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned
and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System instrument where
the panels are continuously incubated at 35°C. The AST has a final inoculum of 5 x 105
CFU/ml. The instrument incubates, reads and records the results of the biochemical
substrates and antimicrobial agents and interprets the reactions to give an ID of the isolate
and MIC value and category interpretation of the antimicrobial agents. Organisms
growing in the presence of a given antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator, signaling
organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or inhibited

by a given antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do not
produce a color change. Additional interpretation is done using software driven
“EXPERT” System using rules derived from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI).
Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an ID result available between 2-12 hours and
an AST result available between 4-16 hours. This is only an autoread result; there are no
manual readings possible.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S15) “Methods for
Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard.”
L. Test Principle:
The system employs conventional, colorimetric, fluorogenic and chromogenic
substrates to identify the genus and species of the isolate. The AST portion of the BD
Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth based microdilution method
that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance detection
of organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells
containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control
wells” which contains no antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Eleven gram-positive on-scale organisms were evaluated for site to site and
inter site reproducibility demonstrating >95% reproducibility. The ten isolate
study described in the guidance document was used (10 organisms tested 3
times on 3 days at 3 sites).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The CLSI recommended QC isolate, S. aureus ATCC 29213 was tested on
every test occasion with the reference method and the BD Phoenix™. Since
the expected range of this isolate was off-scale, another QC strain, E. faecalis
ATCC 51299 with on scale results was used. The reference method QC
results were in range for every day tested. The Phoenix™ was tested a
sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the system can produce QC
results in the CLSI recommended ranges most of the time. Both QC
organisms had the same mode with the reference and the BD Phoenix™.

Inoculum density control: The organism suspension density of the ID
broth was equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard using the BBL™
CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer which was verified each day of testing.
Internal data was used to demonstrate that the use of the BBL™
CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer would produce reproducible results.
Five different instruments were used.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The CLSI recommended broth dilution reference panel was prepared
according to the CLSI recommendation. Clinical testing was performed at
four sites. The testing included both fresh clinical isolates and stock isolates
along with a challenge set with known results. Since Oxacillin Resistant
isolates will be reported as Resistant, only Oxacillin Sensitive isolates were
evaluated. The test device had a growth rate of >90%. A comparison was
provided to the reference method with the following agreement.
