I. Device Description:
The QMS® Vancomycin assay consists of separately packaged reagents (R1 and R2)
and calibrators. R1 is the antibody reagent that contains Vancomycin mouse
monoclonal antibody (mouse ascites) in a buffer as stabilizer and sodium azide as a
preservative. R2 is Vancomycin micro-reagent that contains Vancomycin coated
microparticles in buffer containing a surfactant and sodium azide as a preservative.
Both reagents are supplied in liquid form. The calibrators that are included with the
assay were previously cleared in k872644 as the Innofluor Vancomycin Calibrator
Set. The calibrators consist of six levels of one ml in liquid frozen form.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
The sponsor referenced the following guidance document(s) in their submission:
NCCLS EP5-A: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry devices.

NCCLS EP9-A: Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples
L. Test Principle:
The QMS Vancomycin assay is a homogeneous particle-enhanced turbidimetric
immunoassay. The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample and
drug coated onto a microparticle for antibody binding sites of the Vancomycin
antibody reagent. The vancomycin-coated microparticle reagent (R2) is rapidly
agglutinated in the presence of the anti-vancomycin antibody reagent (R1) and in the
absence of any competing drug in the sample. The rate of absorbance change is
measured photometrically and is inversely proportional to the rate of agglutination of
the particles. When a sample containing vancomycin is added, the agglutination
reaction is partially inhibited, slowing down the rate of absorbance change. A
concentration-dependent classic agglutination inhibition curve can be obtained with
maximum rate of agglutination at the lowest vancomycin concentration and the
lowest agglutination rate at the highest vancomycin concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was conducted and assessed according to NCCLS EP5-A.
Two separate lots of the QMS Vancomycin reagents were run in
duplicates for 20 non-consecutive days on the Hitachi 717 analyzers
with QMS Vancomycin Calibrators and a commercially available
control. Additionally, within run precision was conducted by re-
running the samples again after 2 hours. The acceptance criterion
was a total CV of less that 10%. The results for both lots are shown
in the two tables below.

Accuracy by recovery was determined by spiking human serum that
was negative for vancomycin with USP traceable vancomycin that
covered the assay range. The samples were analyzed in triplicate
with two lots of the QMS Vancomycin assay. Linear regression for
lot 1 was y=0.955x +0.529 (R2=0.9958) and for
lot 2 was y=0.9632x + 1.153 (R2=0.9965).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was conducted and assessed according to NCCLS EP6-A.
The QMS Vancomycin Assay is designed to quantitate patient
samples between 2.5 µg/mL to 100 µg/mL. Calibrator A (0 µg/mL)
was used as the diluent and Calibrator F (100 µg/mL) was diluted to
75.0, 37.5, 17.5, 7.5 and 2.5 µg/mL midpoint samples. The samples
were run in triplicate with two lots of the assay. Linear regression
plots of USP Vancomycin against recovered vancomycin for
Lot 1 was y= 1.000x -0.6113 (R2= 0.9997) and for
Lot 2 was y=1.0115x- 0.3769 (R2=0.9998).

c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
The QMS Vancomycin assay does not include vancomycin controls
or calibrators. Calibrators were cleared under k872644. The
controls used in with this assay are commercially available. The
sponsor is the current owner and manufacturer of the Innofluor line
and continues to manufacture the calibrators using the same
validated procedures established at the time of clearance for
k872644.
d. Detection limit:
The sensitivity, or lowest detectable dose (LDD), is defined by the
sponsor as the lowest concentration of analyte detectable from zero
with 95% confidence when performing the assay. Sensitivity was
established by determining the average concentration of analyte
present in 20 replicates of the negative Calibrator A with two lots of
the QMS Vancomycin assay. The LDD was calculated using the
following formula:
LDD = 2x (SD mAbs of Zero Cal) x (Conc of 1st non-zero Cal)
(mAbs of Zero Cal – mAbs of 1st non-zero cal)

Avg 1.01 µg/mL 0.22 µg/mL
SD 0.27 µg/mL 0.19 µg/mL
LDD 0.53 µg/mL 0.38 µg/mL
The average LDD was 0.46 µg/mL, which supports a claim of 0.55
µg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Percent cross-reactivity was assessed according to the NCCLS EP7-
A. The QMS Vancomycin assay utilizes a mouse derived (ascites)
vancomycin monoclonal antibody directed against vancomycin.
Specificity was conducted by determining cross-reactivity to the
metabolites of vancomycin. In vivo, vancomycin degrades into its
metabolite, CDP-l (crystalline degradation product-l). CDP-l has
two forms, CDP-l major and CDP-l minor. The sponsor states
difficulty in isolation of the major and minor atropisomers, isomers
which arise by restricted rotation around a single bond, in sufficient

amounts for a cross reactivity study, so a combined cross reactivity
study of CDP-l major: minor isomers was performed to obtain the
total cross-reactivity of the metabolites. The metabolites at
100 µg/mL were spiked into serum with vancomycin at 25 µg/mL.
The control sample was vancomycin in human serum with no
metabolites. The control and spiked sample were assayed (n=5)
using two lots of QMS Vancomycin assay in triplicate. Cross-
reactivity was determined using the following equation:
= (Conc. of vancomycin in spiked sample- conc. of vancomycin in control) x 100
Conc. of Cross-reactant
If the numerator was less than a SD of the control, percent cross-
reactivity was reported as not detectable. See the chart below.

The result show that CDP-l showed cross reactivity with the QMS
Vancomycin assay that was less that 5%.
The cross-reactivity for Teicoplanin (a structurally similar
compound) was conducted. Four concentrations of Teicoplanin was
spiked into human serum containing 25 µg/mL vancomycin and
tested with two lots of the QMS Vancomycin assay. The result of
the cross-reactivity data is shown in the chart below and showed no
cross-reactivity with the QMS Vancomycin assay.

Cross Reactivity of drugs that are commonly co-administered with
vancomycin were tested in normal human serum. Cross–reactants
were analyzed at 500 µg/mL in a vancomycin spiked serum pool at
25 µg/mL. Cross-reactant stock concentrations were either at 100x
or 10x of the final concentration tested. Test samples were prepared

for each solvent system by combining 99 volumes of the stock
analyte solution with 1 volume of 100x or 10x cross-reactant stock.
Control aliquots were prepared for each solvent system by
combining 99 volumes of the stock analyte solution with 1 volume
of normal human whole blood. The test and control samples were
run in triplicate and the cross-reactivities were calculated using the
following formula.
Percent Cross-Reactivity = ((Da-Dt)/C) X100
Dt = average observed concentration of the control solution
Da = average of the observed concentration of the cross-reactant test solution
C = concentration at which the cross-reactant is tested.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison was conducted according to the NCCLS EP9-A
to determine equivalence between the QMS Vancomycin and Abbott
TDx Vancomycin assays. Clinical serum samples (146 samples for
lot 1 and 148 samples for lot 2) were tested with the predicate and
the device that ranged from 0.04 to 100 µg/mL vancomycin. The
relationship between vancomycin concentrations derived using each
device was evaluated using Passing-Bablok Linear regression. Mean
values for the TDx reference methods were plotted against those for
the QMS on Hitachi 717. The results for both lots are shown in the
table below.
Lot 1 Lot 2
N 146 148
Slope 1.03 (95% CI of 0.997 to 1.062) 1.05 (95% CI of 1.017 to 1.092)
Y Intercept 1.11 (95% CI of 0.58 to 1.55) 1.17 (95% CI of 0.56 to 1.73)
R2 0.970 0.964
b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor demonstrated equivalence between serum and plasma
by conducting the following studies: performance characteristics of
the assay for serum and plasma studies, interferences when using
different types of collection tubes and sample stability at 2 to 8 °C
and -20 °C storage conditions.
Blood were drawn from six healthy volunteers (no vancomycin
therapy) into plasma (4 types) and serum (3 types) tubes. Plasma
(K2 and K3 EDTA, Lithium and Sodium Heparin) and serum (SST,
plastic tube with clot activator and a plastic tube with no additive)
samples were divided into two equal parts. Vancomycin was spiked
at low (7.5 µg/mL) and high (30 µg/mL) concentrations into the
plasma and serum pools and analyzed on a Hitachi 717 analyzer.
The results are shown in the chart below and so now significant
difference between the recovery of vancomycin in serum or plasma.
The collection tube evaluated showed no adverse effects on the
vancomycin recovery and supports the claim for both serum and
plasma samples with the QMS Vancomycin assay.

The samples from all tube types were divided into two portions and
stored at 2-8 °C and -20 °C and retested at week one and week two
to test anticoagulant interference. The results showed that there were
no interferences with regard to recovery of vancomycin in serum or
plasma for the 7 tube types tested. The results also showed that the
samples are stable at both temperatures for at least 15 days.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Therapeutic peak serum levels of 20- 40 µg/mL and trough levels of 5- 10
µg/mL have been reported for most strains of staphylococci and streptococci.
However, therapeutic levels must be individually established based on patient
differences and bacterial susceptibility. The risk of toxicity is appreciably
increased by high concentration or prolonged therapy in patients with renal
insufficiency. Toxic effects, such as ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, have
resulted when serum concentrations reach 80-100 µg/mL and are rarely seen
when serum levels are maintained below 30 µg/mL.
Sponsor references literature for these expected values/reference ranges.

N. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
