75, Clinical Chemistry
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indication for below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Pleural Fluid
The Omni (Modular, C, and S) can be used for the measurement of pH in
pleural fluid, as long as care is taken to ensure that the specimen to be
analyzed is clear of fibrin clots or other debris which may block the sample
transport system.
The pH measurement of pleural fluid can be a clinically useful tool in the
management of patients with paraneumonic effusions.
Critical Values:
pH>7.3 is measured in uncomplicated paraneumonic effusions. All pleural
effusions with a pH of <7.3 are referred as complicated paraneumonic
effusions; they are exudative in nature.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Pleural fluid pH on the Roche Omni (Modular, C, and S) is to be used only
in the pH range of 7.0 – 7.5
4. Special instrument requirements:
For professional use only.
I. Device Description:
The Omni (Modular, C, and S) pH electrode uses the Sorensen 1909
principle which is based on the measurement of hydrogen ion (H+)
concentration. The electrodes consist of a special H+ glass membrane and
an accompanying Ag/AgCL reference electrode. The pH electrode is a
component of an array of Ion Selective electrodes used to measure
specific ions in the blood.

Ion Selective Electrode (ISE)
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision/Reproducibility was established in the initial submission of
the OMNI Modular Analyzer (k990092), the OMNI C Analyzer
(k013373) and the Omni S Analyzer (k032311) on whole blood.
Further studies of the Precision/Reproducibility of pleural fluid pH were
researched in literature on the predicate device. These findings are
referenced in section P. - Other Supportive Device and Instrument
Information.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity/assay reportable range was established in the initial
submission of the OMNI Modular Analyzer (k990092), the OMNI C
Analyzer (k013373) and the Omni S Analyzer (k032311) on whole
blood.
Further studies of the Linearity/assay reportable range of pleural fluid
pH were researched in literature on the predicate device. These
findings are referenced in section P. - Other Supportive Device and
Instrument Information.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
Traceability, Stability, and Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods) were established in the initial submission of the OMNI
Modular Analyzer (k990092), the OMNI C Analyzer (k013373) and the
Omni S Analyzer (k032311) on whole blood.
Further studies of the Traceability, Stability, and Expected values
(controls, calibrators, or methods) of pleural fluid pH were researched
in literature on the predicate device. These findings are referenced in

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Roche Diagnostics used regression analysis to determine the
appropriate range for pleural fluid. The defined specification was a
difference of no more than 0.7 pH units. 35 samples were used in the
regression analysis. The correlation coefficient between the OMNI and
