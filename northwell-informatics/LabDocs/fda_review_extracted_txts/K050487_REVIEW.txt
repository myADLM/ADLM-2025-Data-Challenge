K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI Document EP5-A, EP6-A, EP7-A, and EP9-A2
L. Test Principle:
The Quantia Lp(a) Latex Reagent is a suspension of polystyrene latex particles of
uniform size coated with rabbit IgG anti-human Lp(a). When a sample containing
Lp(a) is mixed with the Latex Reagent and the reaction buffer included in the kit, a
clear agglutination occurs. The degree of agglutination is directly proportional to the
concentration of Lp(a) in the sample and is determined by measuring the decrease of
transmitted light caused by the aggregates.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed on a AEROSET System using the Quantia
Lp(a) Control I and II (low and high) run in duplicate twice a dayover twenty
days (n=80). The within run, between run and total CV were calculated
according to CLIS EP5-Aand summarized in following table.
Material n Mean (mg/dL) Within Run CV (%) Between Run CV (%) Total CV(%)
Low 80 16.1 2.3 2.0 3.4
Medium 80 38.1 1.5 1.1 2.6
High 80 57.9 0.9 0.8 1.6
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was assessed according to CLSI EP6-A guideline.
1.28 to 90 mg/dL (2.0 to 204 nmol/L) without the automatic rerun capability
1.28 to 360 mg/dL (2.0 to 816 nmol/L) with the automatic rerun capability.
If after the automatic rerun the concentration of the sample exceeds the
linearity range, dilute the sample 1:10 with saline solution, re-assay and
multiply the result by the dilution factor of 10.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Quantia Lp(a) Control (level I and II) are prepared from human sera
containing Lp(a), and sodium azide (< 0.1%). Refer to control value sheet for
assigned values. Verify that the lot number listed on each bottle of the control
agrees with the lot number printed on the value sheet. Reconstituted stability
testing was performed to support the Quantia Lp(a) Control (low and high) of
15 days at 2-80C after reconstitution.

The calibrator is prepared from human sera containing Lp(a) and sodium
azide < 0.1%. Calibration stability testing was performed using the Abbot
Clinical Chemistry System AEROSET to support that calibration is stable for
at least 30 days. Reconstituted stability testing was performed to support the
Quantia Lp(a) Standard of 15 days at 2-80C after reconstitution.
c. Detection limit:
The detection limit was calculated by running thirty replicates of physiologic
saline on an AEROSET System. The mean and standard deviation were
calculated. The detection limit is defined as the mean reported value for the
physiologic saline plus two standard deviations. The detection limit of this
assay is 0.38 mg/dL.
d. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed on an AEROSET System by spiking a
sample containing Lipoprotein (a). For each interfering substance the sample
was split in two aliquots, one being spiked with the concentrated interfering
substance and the other with the control buffer (the buffer in which the
interfering substance is dissolved). For this study , CLSI EP7-A was followed
with the following results that no significant interference by:
Hemoglobin up to 460 mg/dL
Bilirubin up to 19.6 mg/dL
Triglycerides up to 1327 mg/dL
Turbidity of sample up to 2.3 AU/cm at 660 nm
Rheumatoid Factor up to 800 IU/ml
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Following CLSI EP9-A2, a comparative performance study was conducted by
using 104 patient serum samples analyzed in duplicate with Quantia Lp(a) on
an AEROSET System versus predicate, Dade Behring’s N Latex Lp(a) on
aBNII. The samples concentrations ranged from 2.4 to 188 mg/dL of Lp(a).

Lithium Heparin plasma, Sodium Heparin plasma and citrate plasma paired to

paired serum and different plasma samples were equivalent.
