K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The Quantia IgE Latex Reagent is a suspension of polystyrene particles of
uniform size coated with mouse anti-human IgE monoclonal antibody. When a
sample containing IgE is mixed with the latex reagent and the reaction buffer
included in the kit, a clear agglutination occurs. The degree of agglutination is
directly proportional to the concentration of IgE in the sample and is determined
by measuring the decrease of transmitted light caused by the aggregates. Results
are expressed in IU/mL of IgE.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was performed using three samples (Quantia
Ferritin/Myoglobin/IgE low and high controls and a mixture of the two
controls), run in duplicate twice a day over 20 days on an AEROSET®
System (n=80). This experiment was performed by one operator on one
site with one lot of reagent.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed on an AEROSET® System using a
serum sample containing 1300 IU/mL of IgE diluted in physiologic
saline at 7 different dilutions (5%,10%, 20%,30%, 40%, 50%, and 75%).
Each dilution was analyzed in quadruplicate. Testing was done without
automatic rerun capability. The reported means were calculated from the
pooled results. Regression analysis yielded y = 1.006x – 3.6 and a
correlation coefficient (r2) of 0.9996. Results showed the assay range is
linear for IgE concentrations ranging from 25 to 1000 IU/mL.
The AEROSET® System can automatically rerun samples with results
above the upper limit of the assay range (1000 IU/mL) at 1:10 sample
dilutions and then automatically recalculates the new sample result. Two
studies using two sample pools were done to assess the extended
linearity range. One sample pool containing 6719 IU/mL IgE was
analyzed 4 times the normal sample volume (equivalent to 26,887
IU/mL IgE), was diluted 4 times (6.25%, 12.5%, 25%, and 50%) with
physiological saline . The other sample pool containing 3500 IU/mL IgE
was analyzed the same way (equivalent to 7812 IU/mL), was diluted 6
times (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, and 50%). Each dilution was analyzed
in quadruplicate. The reported means were calculated from the pooled
results. Regression analysis yielded y= 0.999x + 1.4 and correlation
coefficient (r2) = 0.9880. Results showed that extended assay rangewith
automatic rerun capability is linear for IgE concentrations ranging from
25 to 26000 IU/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
The reference material is the 2nd WHO International Reference
Preparation Human Serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE), NIBSC code
75/502.Value assignments were determined in multiple runs using
specific lots of reagents. A detailed description of the assignment of the
Quantia IgE calibrators and control values is provided.
Calibration Stability – The data indicated that the calibration is stable for
at least 30 days.
Reconstituted Control Stability – The data indicated that the controls I
and II are stable for at least 15 days at 2-8oC after reconstitution.

The shelf-life stability for the standards was 18 months and the controls
24 months at 2-8°C.
d. Detection limit:
Detection limit was calculated by running 30 replicates of physiologic
saline on an AEROSET® System. The mean and the standard deviation
(SD) were calculated. The detection limit is defined as the mean
reported value for the physiologic saline plus 2 SD. The Detection Limit
was found to be 6.9 IU/mL.
Limit of quantification is the smallest concentration of unknown that can
be reliably be quantified by the assay and was determined using 6
dilutions of the 100 IU/mL (10%, 15%, 25%, 33%, 50%, and 75%)
Quantia IgE Standard in physiologic saline on an AEROSET® System.
Each dilution was run in quadruplicate. The data support the claim for a
limit of quantification of 25 IU/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed on an AEROSET® System by
spiking a sample containing IgE. For each interfering substance, the
sample was split into two aliquots, one spiked with a concentrated
interfering substance and the other with the control buffer. Each aliquot
was analyzed 10 times with a single lot of Quantia IgE reagent. The
acceptance criteria are as follows:
· If the recovery of the spiked sample is within 95-105% of the
unspiked sample result (within ± 5%) no further studies are
needed. If not, several concentrations of the interfering
substances were studied and the concentration causing 5%, 10%
and 15% interference were assessed.
No significant interference was observed for:
· Hemoglobin up to 482 mg/dL
· Bilirubin up to 20.8 mg/dL
· Triglycerides up to 1327 mg/dL
· Turbidity of sample up to 2.38 AU/cm at 660 nm.
· Rheumatoid Factor interference is below 10% up to 138 IU/mL.
Since the interference for RF exceeded 5%, a dose response study was
performed by mixing in different proportions of the two aliquots. From
the fitted interferogram curve, the RF concentrations causing
interference was extrapolated with the following results:
5%: 69 IU/mL 10%: 138 IU/mL 15%: 207 IU/mL
No cross-reactivity studies have been conducted with heterophile
antibodies and this information is included in the Limitations section of
the package insert.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The reported expected range for IgE is from a literature: In clinically healthy
subjects the serum IgE levels exhibit a wide distribution range and do not
follow a normal distribution. Age related concentrations must be taken into
account when interpreting IgE values in children. IgE does not cross the
placental barrier so IgE is not detectable in newborn. The IgE concentration
increases during the first years of life, reaching a peak at 10-15 years and
dropping subsequently to adult values1. As the limit of quantification of
Quantia IgE is 25 IU/mL, it is not recommended to use this test with
children below the age of 12 months.
