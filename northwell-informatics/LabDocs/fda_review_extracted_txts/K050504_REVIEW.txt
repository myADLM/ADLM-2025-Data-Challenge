comprised of three separate kits designated as UC1, UC2, and OSMO. Each kit
of UC1, UC2 consists of two bottles each of six levels including zero. The OSMO
set consists of two bottles each of five levels. All sets are in a human or serum
matrix compatible with chemistry systems.
Human source material from which this product has been derived has been
tested at the donor level for the Human Immunodeficient Virus (HIV1, HIV2)
antibody, Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HbsAg) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and
found to be non-reactive. FDA approved methods have been used to conduct
these tests.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or

The test sets, Cat # 701 / 702 / 703, are prepared in a human urine
matrix to which analytes of a chemical or biological (human or animal)
nature are added along with preservatives, stabilizers, and other
excipients. The concentration of the added chemicals or biologicals
are subsequently measured on various clinical chemistry analyzer
systems using methods designed for measurement of these analytes
in human urine. Levels 1 and 5 are prepared so that Level 1 meets the
lower limit of the instrument manufacturer's claimed linearity and Level
5 the upper limit. Levels 1 and 5 are assayed in triplicate on the
applicable instrument system. When the recovered values meet the
acceptance tolerance, admixtures of Levels 1 and 5 are made to
create Levels 2, 3 and 4. Levels 2, 3 and 4 are then tested, again in
triplicate, to validate that recovery meets the required tolerance. After
this testing event, all levels are labeled and filled after which final in
process testing (FIPT) is performed, again in triplicate, for all analytes
in each level. Each testing event requires each level be assayed in
triplicate on the system for which the product is designed.
