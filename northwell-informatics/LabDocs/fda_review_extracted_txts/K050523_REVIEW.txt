K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The diaDexus PLAC™ Test is a sandwich-type enzyme immunoassay that uses two
anti-Lp-PLA monoclonal antibodies. One antibody is immobilized on the bottom of
2
microtiter wells. Sample and buffer are incubated in the wells and the unbound
fractions are washed off. The second antibody (labeled with horseradish peroxidase)
is added and incubated to bind with the Lp-PLA bound to the surface of the well.
2
The excess is washed away, and a colorimetric substrate is added and allowed to react
with the peroxidase to form a blue color. A stop solution converts the resulting color
from blue to yellow which is measure spectrophotometrically at 450 nm. The
measured absorbance is directly proportional to the amount of Lp-PLA in the
2
sample.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
A study was conducted by the manufacturer using 956 samples from patients
who were part of a large multi-center epidemiologic study, sponsored by the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Patients, 47 to 69 years of age, were
free from coronary heart disease or stroke at the start of the study and
followed for the development of coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke for
~9 years. This was a case-cohort study where samples from all the ischemic
stroke cases associated with atherosclerosis (194) were tested together with
762 appropriately matched participants without CHD or stroke (controls).
Cox regression models were used to evaluate the association of Lp-PLA2 and
ischemic stroke associated with atherosclerosis, using a univariate analysis
(Model 1), a univariate analysis adjusted for demographics (Model 2), and a
multivariate model adjusted for demographics and other prognostic factors
(Model 3). The same cutpoints of Lp-PLA2 as were used in the original CHD
risk indication were investigated in this study (420 and 310 ng/mL, the 67th
and 33rd percentiles, respectively) to divide study participants into tertiles.
The hazard ratios of the Cox regression analyses demonstrated that Lp-PLA2
may be used as a predictor of risk for ischemic stroke associated with
atherosclerosis for the highest tertile when compared to the lowest tertile of
Lp-PLA2. See tables below for additional information.

Further analyses were performed to determine if Lp-PLA was predictive of ischemic
2
stroke associated with atherosclerosis across the complete range of systolic blood
pressure (SBP) in the population, and to determine whether blood pressure and Lp-PLA
2
were additive in assessing risk for ischemic stroke. Systolic blood pressure tertile
cutpoints were assigned by the 33rd and 67th percentiles of the population (113 and 130
mm Hg, respectively). The study population was divided into the low, mid, and high
range (1st, 2nd, and 3rdtertile) of SBP and the low, mid, and high range of Lp-PLA . The
2
relative risk of each group was compared to the risk of events associated with the group
in the 1sttertile of the two variables.

CHD was a strong predictor of ischemic stroke associated with atherosclerosis in all three
models (see Tables below). However, the third tertile of Lp-PLA remained a predictor
2
even when CHD was incorporated in all three models with risk ratios decreasing by less
than 0.2 units in all cases.
