b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The mean values were derived from replicate analysis. The tests listed in the
labeling were performed by the reagent manufacturer and/or independent
laboratories using manufacturer supported reagents.
Accelerated stability studies were performed to support shelf life of the
product. Real time studies are on-going for the life of the product. The
acceptance criterion is defined as T final being ± 10% T zero. The results are as
follows:
Shelf life stability: 3 years at -20 to -70ºC
Open vial stability: 20 days at 2 to 8º C
d. Detection limit:
Not Applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Not Applicable
f. Assay cut-off:
