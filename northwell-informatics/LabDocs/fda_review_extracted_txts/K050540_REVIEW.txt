The test provides only preliminary test results, which should be confirmed by
other methods such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Clinical
considerations and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse
test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated. The tests
are not intended to be used in monitoring the drug levels.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Professional and In Vitro Diagnostics use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable, as the device is a visually-read single-use device.
I. Device Description:
The UCP Rapid™ Drug Screening Test Strip and Device is a competitive binding
immunoassay used for the qualitative determination of drug and drug metabolite. The
devices contain membrane strips coated with drug-protein conjugates (purified bovine
albumin) on the T zone, goat polyclonal antibody against gold-protein conjugate at
the C zone and a dye pad which contains colloidal gold particles coated with mouse
monoclonal antibodies specific against Amphetamine, Barbiturate, Benzodiazepine,
Cocaine, Methamphetamine, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Morphine,
Methadone, Opiates, Oxycodone, THC and Phencyclidine. Both devices are single-
use and visually read. One is a dipstick device and the other is a cassette device.

sample is applied to the sample pad of the test device, the sample migrates through
the test device by capillary action. If the drug or drug metabolite concentration in the
sample is below the cutoff level, the anti-drug antibodies in colloidal gold particles
will bind to the drug antigens coated in the test line (in the test region) of the
nitrocellulose membrane to form a red line, a negative result. If the concentration of
drug in the sample is at a cutoff level or higher, it will bind with antibodies
conjugates with colloidal gold particles so that no line will develop in the test region,
a positive result. The colloidal gold antibody conjugate should bind to the C line
(control region) and form a purple-colored band regardless of the presence of drug or
drug metabolite in the urine specimen.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision/Reproducibility studies were performed using commercially
available drug standards in which the drug concentrations were confirmed by
GC/MS. The standard was diluted in normal, drug-free human urine to give
drug concentrations at the following levels: 0, 50% below cutoff, 25% below
cut-off, cutoff, 25% above cut-off and 50% above cut-off. A total of 60
determinations were made at each concentration for each analyte. Testing was
performed four times per day for five days by three operators (two are trained
laboratory workers and one is a professional with limited laboratory
experience) using one lot of testing devices in the sponsor’s facility. All
samples tested at 0, -50%yeilded negative results and all samples +50%
yielded positive results. Within lot Precision Study data for -25%, cutoff and
+ 25% is summarized below:

Inter Lot Reproducibility:
To test inter lot reproducibility, normal human urine known to be drug-free
was spiked with commercially available drug standard to the following levels:
0, 50% below cutoff, 25% below cutoff, cutoff, 25% above cutoff and 50%
above cutoff. Testing was performed using three different lot numbers, 20
samples of each lot were run at each of the concentrations for each drug over
30 days. All samples tested at 0, -50% yielded negative results and all samples
+50% yielded positive results. Inter lot Precision Study data fro -25%, cutoff

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. The assay is intended for qualitative use.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Procedural controls are included in the test strip and device. A red colored line
appearing in the control zone is considered as an internal procedural control. It
confirms sufficient specimen volume, adequate membrane wicking and that
the correct technique has been used. Users are informed not to interpret the
test if no red line appears in the control zone.
Control standards are not supplied with these tests; however it is
recommended that positive and negative controls be tested as a good
laboratory practice to confirm the test procedure and to verify proper test

Stability:
Real time stabilities studies have been conducted. Protocols and acceptance
criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims
the following expiration date:
When stored at 2 – 30 ºC product is good until expiration date which is 18
months.
d. Detection limit:
Sensitivity of UCP Rapid™ Drug Tests was characterized by validating the
test performance around the claimed cutoff concentration of the test. The
following targeted drugs were spiked into human urine known to be drug-free:

The cutoff of each drug test was determined by the lowest concentration of
drug which produces at least 50% positive results in total numbers of
determinations. 20 replicates were run at each drug concentration from 0, 50%
below cutoff, 25% below cutoff, cutoff, 25% above cutoff and 50% above
cutoff. The results are summarized below:

The data presented in this section is consistent with the results from the
precision study. Based on the above data, sensitivity of the assay for the 12
analytes is as follows:
Amphetamine (AMP) 1000ng/mL Methamphetamine (MDMA) 500ng/mL
Barbiturate (BAR) 300ng/mL Methamphetamine (MET) 1000ng/mL
Benzodiazepine (BZD) 300ng/mL Opiates (OPI 300) 300ng/mL
Cannabinoid (THC) 50ng/mL Opiates (OPI 2000) 2000ng/mL
Cocaine (COC) 300ng/mL Oxycodone (OXY) 100ng/mL
Methadone (MTD) 300ng/Ml Phencyclidine (PCP) 25ng/mL
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking various concentrations of similarly
structured drug compounds into drug-free urine/a negative control. By
analyzing various concentration of each compound the sponsor determined the
concentration of the drug that produced a response approximately equivalent
to the cutoff concentration of the assay. Results of those studies appear in the
tables below:

f. Assay cut-off:
The identified cutoff concentrations for amphetamine, cocaine,
methamphetamine (MDMA), opiates 2000, Phencyclidine and THC are those
recommended by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA). Analytical performance of the device around the
cutoff is described in Section1.M.d above. The test will yield a positive result
when a given drug exceeds this concentration in the urine sample.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
128 unaltered clinical urine samples per drug type were evaluated. Specimens
obtained from reference laboratories were tested using the predicate device
and the Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). For each drug
test, approximately 10% of samples had drug concentration between 50%
below the cutoff and the cutoff concentration, another 10% of samples had
drug concentrations between the cutoff and 50% above the cutoff
concentration. The study was performed at the sponsor’s facility by one
member of the sponsor’s staff.

Comparison testing was performed between the test strip device and the
cassette device. Normal human urine known to be drug-free was spiked
with commercially available drug standard to the following levels: 0, 50%
below cutoff, 25% below cutoff, cutoff, 25% above cutoff and 50% above
cutoff. Testing was performed using the same lot number, 20 samples
were run at each of the concentrations for each drug. For each drug at each
drug concentration the results were identical.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. This device is only for use with urine samples.
