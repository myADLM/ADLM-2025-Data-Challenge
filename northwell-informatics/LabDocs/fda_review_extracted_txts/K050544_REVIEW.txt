H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The HemosIL D-Dimer HS is an automated latex enhanced immunoassay for the
quantitative determination of D-Dimer in human citrated plasma on ACL TOP
Coagulation Instrument as an aid in the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism
(VTE), [deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE)]
2. Indication(s) for use:
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
4. Special instrument requirements:
I. Device Description:
The HemosIL D-Dimer HS Kit consists of a D-Dimer Calibrator (2 vials x 1 mL),
Latex Reagent (3 vials x 2 mL), and Reaction Buffer.
The D-Dimer HS Latex Reagent is a suspension of polystyrene latex particles of
uniform size coated with the F (ab’) fragment of a monoclonal antibody highly
2
specific for the D-Dimer domain included in fibrin soluble derivatives. The use of
the F (ab’) allows a more specific D-Dimer detection avoiding the interference of
2
Rheumatoid Factor. The Calibrator is a lyophilized solution of D-Dimer partially
purified from human fibrin digested with human plasmin containing bovine serum
albumin, buffer, stabilizers, and preservative.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
L. Test Principle:
Elevated levels of D-Dimer are found in clinical conditions such as deep vein
thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and disseminated intravascular
coagulation (DIC).
When plasma containing D-Dimer is mixed with the Latex Reagent and Reaction
Buffer, the coated latex particles agglutinate. The degree of agglutination is directly
proportional to the concentration of D-Dimer in the sample and is determined by
measuring the decrease of the transmitted light

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
2 levels of controls and a prepared D-Dimer plasma pool, were assayed in
duplicate twice a day for twenty days on two different ACL TOP instruments
(n=80) in accordance with NCCLS Document EP5-A.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Several studies were performed to
demonstrate assay linearity.
1. Quantification Limit- HemosIL D-Dimer HS Calibrator (Calibrator 3500
ng/mL) diluted in saline containing BSA in concentrations of 86 – 207 ng/mL.
Each dilution was assayed five times on two lots of HemosIL D-Dimer HS
reagents. Results supported the linearity claims in the product insert for
HemosIL D-Dimer HS on the ACL TOP of 150-69000 ng/mL.
2. Linearity studies were performed on the ACL TOP with the auto rerun feature
deactivated with the HemosIL D-Dimer HS Calibrator (Calibrator 3500
ng/mL) diluted in saline containing BSA in concentrations of 5-112 %. Each
dilution was assayed five times on two lots of HemosIL D-Dimer HS
reagents. Results supported the linearity claims in the product insert for
HemosIL D-Dimer HS with the auto rerun feature off, on the ACL TOP of
150-3680 ng/mL.

3. . Linearity studies were performed on the ACL TOP, with the auto rerun
feature activated, using dilutions of an internally prepared Prozone Control
(D-Dimer concentration >100000 ng/mL) diluted in saline containing BSA in
concentrations of 0.375-100 %. Each dilution was assayed five times on two
lots of HemosIL D-Dimer HS reagents. Results supported the linearity claims
in the product insert for HemosIL D-Dimer HS with the auto rerun feature on,
on the ACL TOP of 150-69000 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls used in the performance studies were previously FDA cleared under
K972696. The calibrator was cleared under K032419.
Stability data was presented that compared fresh vs. frozen samples (n=91).
Aliquots of each fresh sample were prepare and frozen at <-70ºC for 11 days
and then tested with HemosIL D-Dimer HS. Slope and intercept were
calculated by Passing and Babcock and the correlation coefficient was
calculated by Pearson (y=1.099x -0.781).
d. Detection limit:
20 replicates of HemosIL Factor Diluent (physiologic saline) ran on ACL
TOP using two different lots of HemosIL D-Dimer HS reagents. The mean
plus three standard deviations were calculated, and the maximum value was
considered the limit of detection.
Lot 1 Lot 2
Mean ± 3SD 21 ng/mL 20ng/mL
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed in accordance with NCCLS Document
EP6-A on ACL TOP by spiking the highest concentration of each interfering
to be claimed into two samples (low and High D-Dimer concentrations) and
comparing the results against the unspiked sample results. All samples were
tested in ten replicates with a single lot of HemosIL D-Dimer HS reagents.
Results supported labeling claims for no significant interference by
hemoglobin up to 500 mg/dl, bilirubin up to 18 mg/dL, triglycerides up to
1327 mg/dL, and rheumatoid factor up to 1400 IU/mL

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
An in-house clinical study was performed comparing the HemosIL D-Dimer
HS to the predicate (n=264). Samples were analyzed in duplicate. 35 of the
samples were removed form the study based on the following: 7 samples
reported “baseline average alarm fail” errors with the predicated device due to
turbidity, and 28 of the samples reported RF results above 10 IU/mL (a
labeled interferent). Total number of samples used in final calculations = 229.
Slope and intercept were calculated by Passing and Babcock and the
correlation coefficient was calculated by Pearson (y=0.949x-50.298).
To demonstrate lack of variation between the mean results and the single
value results, the correlation data were also calculated using the first replicate
of the new test versus the first replicate of the predicate test. Single results
(new vs. predicate) are comparable to the mean results (y=0.957x – 50.254).
A field study was conducted comparing the HemosIL D-Dimer HS to the
predicate using 166 frozen samples. Samples were analyzed in singlet. Slope
and intercept were calculated by Passing and Babcock and the correlation
coefficient was calculated by Pearson (y=1.054x-4.2985).

4. Clinical cut-off:
The study involved 100 frozen samples from non-consecutive outpatients
suspected of VTE. The samples were selected to include ~a 30% prevalence of
positive VTE samples and then sent to Biokit (HemosIL D-Dimer HS
manufacturer) blinded, without the diagnosis information. Of the 100 samples 32
were confirmed positives for PE, and 68 were confirmed negatives. Each of the
samples was evaluated with the HemosIL D-Dimer HS on the ACL TOP. Based
on a cut-off of 230ng/mL, a sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of
100% was obtained.
