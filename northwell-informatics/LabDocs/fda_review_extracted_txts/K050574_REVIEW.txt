The device is for in vitro diagnostic prescription use. It is also intended for Point-of-Care
(POC) use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The reagents may only be used on the Afinion AS100 Analyzer.
I. Device Description:
Afinion AS100 Analyzer
The Afinion™ test system is a closed system consisting of the Afinion™ AS100 Analyzer
and the Afinion™ Test Cartridges. The AS100 is a multi-assay analyzer for point-of-care
use.
The analyzer utilizes a digital camera and Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) to perform two
kinds of measurements; reflection measurement (amount of light reflected from a membrane)
2

--- Page 3 ---
and transmission measurement (amount of light propagating through a liquid). The analyzer
comes to the user already calibrated, and the calibration information is placed on the
cartridge bar code.
The analyzer performs optical, electronic and mechanical checks on the capillary tube, the
test cartridge, and individual processing steps. If the analyzer detects an error the assay will
be interrupted and patient results are not reported. An error message will be displayed. The
operator refers to the User Manual for interpretation of the error message.
To perform a test the capillary-like collection device is used to draws up either a patient or
control sample. The collection device is inserted into the test cartridge then placed in the
cartridge chamber of the analyzer. The lid is closed and the cartridge is transported into the
analysis compartment. Test and lot specific information read from the barcode label tells the
analyzer how to process the cartridge. The sample and reagents are automatically transferred
between the wells of the cartridge. A monochrome solid-state camera monitors the entire
process. When the assay is completed, LEDs illuminate the final reaction area, which can be
either a colored membrane or a reaction well. The camera detects the reflected or transmitted
light, which is converted to a test result and displayed on the screen. When the user accepts
the result, the lid opens and the used cartridge is removed and discarded.
Afinion HbA1c Test Cartridge
The cartridge consists of the sampling device and the reagent container. The cartridge has a
barcode label with lot specific information and an ID area for the user to record the sample
ID.
Reagents contained within the cartridge include:
Conjugate- blue boronic acid conjugate
Membrane tube- tube with a polyethersulfone membrane.
Washing solution- morpholine buffered sodium chloride
Reconstitution reagent- HEPES buffered sodium chloride with lysis and precipitation
agents.
Sodium azide is also present (< 0.1%).
Afinion HbA1c Control
There are 2 assayed liquid ready-for-use preparations designed for use on the Afinion
Analyzer. They consist of porcine whole blood (Control C I) and human whole blood
(Control C II) with stabilizers added.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
DCA2000 Hemoglobin A1c Reagent kit.

--- Page 4 ---
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
k951361
3. Comparison with predicate:
Both devices are for measurement of the same analyte, have the same intended use,
utilize whole blood samples, and both are read on an automated instrument. Both utilize
single-use cartridges and are calibrated in-house by the manufacturer.
The test principles vary; the candidate device is a colorimetric assay measured by
reflectance, whereas the predicate is an immunoassay utilizing latex agglutination. They
are analyzed by different instruments. (The predicate uses the DCA 2000 Analyzer.)
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
The sponsor referenced the following guidance document(s) or standards:
NCCLS document EP5-A. Method Comparison of Precision Performance of Clinical
Chemistry Devices; Approved Guideline.
L. Test Principle:
Afinion™ HbA1c is a fully automated boronate affinity assay. The test Cartridge contains
all of the necessary reagents. The sample is collected with the integrated sampling device and
the Test Cartridge is placed in the cartridge chamber of the analyzer. The blood sample is
then automatically diluted and mixed with a solution that releases hemoglobin from the
erythrocytes. The hemoglobin precipitates. This sample mixture is transferred to a blue
boronic acid conjugate, which binds to the cis-diols of glycated hemoglobin. This reaction
mixture is soaked through a filter membrane and all precipitated hemoglobin, conjugate-
bound and unbound (i.e. glycated and non-glycated hemoglobin) remains on the membrane.
Any excess of conjugate is removed with washing reagent.
The analyzer evaluates the precipitate on the membrane. By measuring the reflectance, the
blue (glycated hemoglobin) and the red (total hemoglobin) color intensities are evaluated.
The ratio between them is proportionate to the percentage of HbA1c in the sample. The %
HbA1c is displayed.
The Afinion™ HbA1c is a fully automated boronate affinity assay for the determination of
the percentage HbA1c in human whole blood.
Sample collected using the sampling device integrated in the Reagent Cartridge is diluted and
mixed with a liquid that lyses the blood cells releasing hemoglobin from the cells. The
sample mixture is transferred to a boronic-acid conjugate, which binds to the cis-diols of
glycated hemoglobin. The reaction mixture is soaked through a filter membrane and
precipitated hemoglobin, glycated and non-glycated remains on the outside of the membrane.
Any excess of conjugate is removed with the washing reagent.

External study
A precision study was performed at three physician office laboratories (site 1-3) on three
Afinion™ AS100 Analyzers. Three levels of HbA1c EDTA blood (samples A-C) were
analyzed. The study was preformed over 10 consecutive days, first 5 days using Lot 1
and the next 5 days using Lot 2. Each day six replicates of the samples were measured.
The external precision validation of the Afinion™ HbA1c assay using the Afinion™
AS100 Analyzer was performed at the three study sites. The study lasted for two weeks,
using one Afinion™ HbA1c Test Cartridge lot for each week. Each day six replicates of
each of the three EDTA blood samples A, B and C were analyzed at the three study sites.
The blood samples were stored at 2-8 °C.

A panel of 16 blood samples with HbA1c values distributed over a clinically important
range was used in addition to Afinion™ HbA1c Control C I and C II. The blood samples
and controls were analyzed in duplicates using three Afinion™ HbA1c lots on one single
Afinion™ Analyzer. The HbA1c results from analysis of the controls and 16 samples
analyzed with three Afinion™ HbA1c lots are shown in table 8.6. Two replicates of each
sample (R1 and R2) were analyzed with each lot.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Afinion™ HbA1c measures the total glycated hemoglobin and the total hemoglobin
concentration. The ratio between them is proportional to the % HbA1c of the sample. The
Analyzer calculates the ratio, and the test result is displayed as % HbA1c.
Linearity within the analytical range of 4-18 % HbA1c was demonstrated by mixing a
sample with a high HbA1c (17.9%) with a sample with a low HbA1c (5.3%). The two
native samples were analyzed 6 times, and the intermediate samples were analyzed in

triplicate. A straight line is observed in the regression plot. The correlation coefficient
r² = 1.00, slope = 1.01 and y-intercept = 0.07 % HbA1c.
The sponsor demonstrated that HbA1c levels could be quantitated accurately between 4
and 18% range when the hemoglobin levels ranged from 6-20 g/dL. The goal of the
study was to show that samples high and low in % HbA1c, but manipulated to varying
Hb concentrations, would give the same % HbA1c result, independent of the Hb
concentration. Three samples had their hemoglobin levels manipulated by removing and
adding plasma. Their hemoglobin levels ranged between 6.0 and 25 mg/dL, and the %
HbA1c levels ranged from 5.6 to 13.3. Samples were analyzed in triplicate CVs of all
replicates were less than 1%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Afinion™ HbA1c is traceable to the IFCC Reference Method for Measurement of
HbA1c6. HbA1c values are reported according to NGSP recommendations at DCCT
level.
The results from the Afinion™ HbA1c assay are traceable to the International Federation
of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) Reference Method for measurement of HbA1c in human
blood. NGSP (National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program, US) recommends
that HbA1c values are reported at DCCT-level (Diabetes Control and Complications
Trial, US). The IFCC Working Group on Standardization of HbA1c has established a
Master Equation for the Designated Comparison Method (the method used in the DCCT
study, referred to as the NGSP Master Equation by the Working Group). This master
equation (NGSP = 0.9148 IFCC + 2.152) is implemented in the Afinion™ AS100
Analyzer software and the Analyzer displays values at DCCT level.
During manufacturing the Analyzers are calibrated against a reference system. This
procedure has been established to ensure that all Analyzers operate within identical
tolerance limits.
Test specific calibration data are established for each lot of Test Cartridges and then
stored in the barcode label. When the Test Cartridge enters the Analyzer, the integrated
camera reads the barcode. The calibration data for the actual lot are transferred to the
instrument and used for calculating results. Calibration by the operator is thus not
required.
Afinion™ HbA1c meets the performance standards established by NGSP (National
Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program, USA).
Afinion™ HbA1c Controls are recommended used for quality control of the Afinion™
HbA1c assay on the Afinion™ AS100 Analyzer. For each lot of controls a target range is
assigned. The assigned % HbA1c value is traceable to the IFCC Reference Method.
To assign the HbA1c values each Afinion™ HbA1c Control lot are analyzed according
8

--- Page 9 ---
to:
1. Minimum three bottles of each control
2. Two approved lots of Afinion™ HbA1c Test Cartridges
3. Three Afinion™ AS100 Analyzers
The target value is calculated as the average of all 18 analyzes for each control.
Internal process control, self-test: A self-test is performed during start-up of the Analyzer
to ensure that the instrument is operating according to established specifications. The
self-test validates:
• Hardware and software integrity
• Test Cartridge transport system
• Liquid transport system
• Camera vision system
If the self-test fails at any point the red LED will start flashing and an information code
will be displayed on the touch screen (see “Information codes and troubleshooting”, page
29). If the Analyzer is unable to use the display, only the red LED will be flashing.
When the Analyzer is switched on for a longer period, it will automatically restart once a
day to ensure that a self-test is done regularly.
Stability studies are summarized for the controls. The sponsor specifies the method used
to analyze the material, environmental storage conditions, frequency of testing, baseline
against which measurements are compared, and acceptance criteria for the study.
Accelerated studies are being used by the sponsor to estimate the expiration date,
however, on-going real time studies are being performed.
d. Detection Limit:
The Afinion™ HbA1c reportable range is 4.0-18.0% HbA1c.
The hemoglobin measuring range is 6-20 g/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The following hemoglobin (Hb) variants have been analyzed and found not to affect the
Afinion™ HbA1c test result: HbAC, HbAE, HbAD and HbAJ10.
Carbamylated hemoglobin and pre-HbA1c do not affect the Afinion™ HbA1c test
result10.
Pre-glycated hemoglobin does not affect the Afinion™ HbA1c result 11.
Interference
A study performed according to the ERL Manufacturer Check Up Certification procedure
by ERL technical staff showed that the Hb-variants HbAC, HbAE, HbAD, HbAJ and
carbamylated Hb do not interfere with analysis of % HbA1c on Afinion AS100 Analyzer.
Blood samples with up to 22 % preglycated hemoglobin (labile form) showed ≤ 5 %
9

--- Page 10 ---
interference with the % HbA1c results when analyzed with the Afinion(cid:31) HbA1c assay.
Effect on quantification by endogenous interfering substances was tested. Bilirubin (0.2
mg/mL), glucose (5.0 mg/mL), lipids (triglycerides; 15.7 mmol/L and cholesterol; 9.1
mmol/L) or fructosamine (680 µmol/L) in EDTA blood samples gave ≤ 2 % interference
when analyzed for % HbA1c on the Afinion™ AS100 Analyzer.
Hemolysed samples cannot be analyzed by the Afinion™ HbA1c assay. Samples with a
degree of hemolysis above 6 % will result in information code 204 (Hemolysed blood
sample) displayed on the Afinion™ AS100 Analyzer and no result will occur. In samples
with a low degree of hemolysis (below 6 %) a negligible interference (<4 %) was
observed when analyzed with Afinion™ HbA1c.
f. Assay cut-off:
N/A. This is a quantitative assay.
2. Comparison studies:
Comparability of the Afinion™ HbA1c assay to the Bayer DCA 2000® Hemoglobin A1c
assay is demonstrated by an internal comparison study performed by Axis-Shield PoC
and as part of an external validation study performed at 3 study sites in the Oslo area.
Comparison to an HbA1c reference method was performed by the European Reference
Laboratory for glycohemoglobin (ERL).
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The test system was evaluated internally, externally (at three POL sites), and by a second
external certifying group (ERL Manufacturer Check Up Certification).
Forty (40) venous EDTA blood samples were analyzed internally on both Afinion™
AS100 Analyzer and Bayer DCA 2000®. The Bland-Altman method comparison showed
acceptable agreement with a bias of -0.3 % HbA1c and 95 % limit of agreement from -
1.0 to 0.4 % HbA1c.
At three external study sites 75 venous EDTA blood samples were analyzed on both
Afinion™ AS100 Analyzer and Bayer DCA 2000®. The linear regression comparison
method showed acceptable agreement with; slope = 0.91, y-intercept = 0.2 % HbA1c and
r² = 0.96.
In total capillary and venous EDTA blood samples from 75 donors were analyzed (25 at
each site). The final distribution from the three study sites based on the DCA 2000
measurements of the EDTA blood was as follows:
Group 1: < 7.0 % HbA1c; 32 samples
Group 2: 7.0-9.0 % HbA1c; 28 samples
Group 3: > 9.0 % HbA1c; 15 samples
10

--- Page 11 ---
In total 75 patients were included as blood donors. Each donor contributed with one
capillary finger prick sample and one venous EDTA sample. The capillary blood samples
were analyzed on the Afinion™ AS100 Analyzer and the EDTA venous blood samples
were analyzed on both the Afinion™ AS100 Analyzer and on DCA 2000 by the study
sites. The samples were analyzed in singleton.

Capillary and venous blood samples from 74 donors were analyzed externally with the
Afinion™ HbA1c assay. The Bland-Altman comparison showed excellent agreement
with a bias of 0.0 % and 95 % limit of agreement from -3.5 to 3.6 %. Linear regression;
slope = 0.99, y-intercept = 0.1 % HbA1c and r² = 0.99.
A method comparison study was performed at three physician office laboratories. A
capillary finger prick sample and a venous EDTA sample were collected from each
donor. The capillary blood samples were analyzed with the AfinionTM AS100 Analyzer.
The EDTA venous blood samples were analyzed with both the AfinionTM AS100
Analyzer and with another Point of Care Testing (POCT) system at the study sites (Table
1, 2). The samples were analyzed in singleton.
In a second method comparison study 39 blood samples were analyzed with an affinity
HPLC system by ERL. The samples were analyzed by Axis-Shield, using the AfinionTM
AS100 Analyzer (Table 3).
Thirtynine (39) venous EDTA blood samples from the European Reference Laboratory
for glycohemoglobin (ERL) were analyzed internally by the Afinion™ HbA1c assay and
by ERL with their reference method Primus CLC385. The Bland-Altman method
comparison showed excellent agreement with a bias of 0.0 % HbA1c and 95 % limit of
agreement from -0.3 to 0.3 % HbA1c.

ERL Manufacturer Check Up Certification
ERL (European Reference Laboratory) is certified as primary reference laboratory (PRL) and
secondary reference laboratory (SRL) in the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization
Program (NGSP). The purpose of the NGSP netword is to standardize their assays to DCCT
(Diabetes Control and Complications Trial) values and to perform certification testing to
document traceability to CDDT values.
ERL operates the Afinion system, performs a total of 78 assays on 10 samples. The samples
cover a variety of sample variables, e.g., hemoglobin S, hemoglobin C, and low and high
hemoglobin values for the purposes of determining the bias and precision of the system. Data is
entered and the software automatically issues a certificate. Other evaluations include those for
Linearity, interferences, and matrix effects. The calculations performed are described on page
115, and a summary of the performance is on the certificate. Acceptable limits for each
parameter appear on page 120. The certificate expires in one year, in this case, January, 2006.
The sponsor’s certificate appears on page 128, and displays gradings of 4 for excellence and 1
for acceptable.
Two lots were included, and the sponsor evaluated lot to lot variability. The variability is based
on the differences between the mean differences from each study site, not individual values. Lot
variability (between the mean values of the three samples evaluated in the precision studies)
were was 0.6, 2.2, and 0.4% for each of the three samples evaluated..
2, 5, and 3 operators participated at each of the three sites.
Patients signed an informed consent. (See page 93.)
b. Matrix comparison:
The assay is intended for several matrices. The sponsor demonstrated equivalence
between them by conducting the following study:
The following sample materials can be used with the AfinionTM HbA1c test:
• Capillary blood sample (from finger prick)
• Venous whole blood without anticoagulants
• Venous whole blood with anticoagulants (EDTA, heparin, citrate or NaF)
Capillary samples and EDTA, Heparin, Na-citrate and NaF blood samples were collected from
10 donors. The results show no difference between the capillary and venous blood with different
anticoagulants. The recoveries, compared to EDTA, varied between 98-103 % for each donor
and anticoagulant. The average recoveries for each anticoagulant were 100-101 % compared to
EDTA.

O. System Descriptions:
Definition of Moderate:
The level of concern is moderate if the operation of the software associated with device
function directly affects the patient and/or operator so that failures or latent design flaws
could result in non-serious injury to the patient and/or operator, or if it indirectly affects the
patient and/or operator (e.g., through the action of a care provider) where incorrect or
delayed information could result in non-serious injury of the patient and/or operator.
1. Modes of Operation:
This is a random access analyzer, employing reflectance technology. See the Principles
section, above.

The Afinion™ Test Cartridges contain all the reagents necessary for the determination of
the analyte to be measured. The sample material is collected using the integrated
sampling device with a capillary manufactured to draw the exact sample volume from a
finger-prick sample or a sample vial. The sampling device is placed directly back into the
Test Cartridge before the Test Cartridge is insert into the Afinion™ AS100 Analyzer.
The analyzing process is fully automated after inserting the cartridge into the analyzer;
the process starts by closing the analyzer lid. Only one cartridge can be run at a time.
All assay and lot specific information necessary for the analyzer to process a test is read
from the barcode fixed to the cartridge. All Afinion™ Test Cartridges are single use and
shall be disposed after use.
