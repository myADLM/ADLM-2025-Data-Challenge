For professional use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Microalbumin TIA is a “ready to use” reagent kit for clinical chemistry auto-
analyzers. Microalbumin TIA has been tested on the Hitachi 911 Clinical
Chemistry analyzer.
I. Device Description:
Microalbumin TIA consists of a “ready to use” reagent kit - Reagent 1
(reactive buffer solution) and Reagent 2 (antibody solution) in a one kit set.
The antibody consists of a duck anti-albumin from purified duck yolk. The host
ducks are domestic stock and are inoculated to prevent avian associated
diseases.
The calibrators consist of 5 levels of albumin in 2 mL bottles. They are
provided in liquid form. The calibrators are prepared from human sera which
were found to be negative for HbsAg, anti-HIV1 and 2 antibodies and anti-
HCV antibody.
The controls consist of 2 levels of albumin in 1.5 mL bottles. They are
provided in liquid form. The controls are prepared from human sera which
were found to be negative for HbsAg, anti-HIV1 and 2 antibodies and anti-
HCV antibody by FDA licensed methods.

GBC Microalbumin Controls are determined by the turbidometric
immunoassay and are traceable to the IFCC/BCR/CAP reference
material CRM 470.
The accelerated stability studies were performed to predict the shelf
life of mAlb set 200 and Microalbumin controls under recommended
storage conditions. The studies were conducted according to FDA-
documented Shelf Life of Medical Devices, FOD 415.
Stability was determined to be 28 days after opening if stored at 2oC to
10oC. Stability unopened was determined to be 9 months when stored
at recommended conditions.
Reagent R1 and R2 are stabile up to the expiration date if stored at
2oC to 10oC. R1 and R2 are stabile opened and refrigerated at 2oC to
10oC for 30 days.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit 0.3 mg/L was calculated as 2SD above the mean
response of the zero calibrator when assayed 20 times.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference was defined as above 10% difference with original assay
values. Interferents with the following concentrations did not interfere
with Microalbumin TIA.
Formalin 750 µg/dL Uric Acid 100 mg/dL
Thymol 50000 µg/dL Creatine 200 mg/dL

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
50 leftover urine samples were collected. Since extensive patient data
was not required in the study, no name or linked identification number
linked with the leftover samples was provided. Microalbumin
measurements were performed on each sample in duplicate. Each
sample was also tested using the predicate devices according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Testing was performed on the Roche
Diagnostics Hitachi 911 analyzer. The results of regression are shown
on the table below:
