ranged between 1.2 and 4.26% CV% on the RET-He parameter and meets
manufacturer specifications of ≤5%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The data showed linearity for RBC (r=1.0) across the tested range of 0.29-
7.48 (x106/µL) and for Reticulocyte (r=0.9988) across the tested range of
0.0135 – 0.6770.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability: Samples should be stored from 18 to 26o C (room temperature) or 4-
8o C (refrigerated). The variation of RET-He [pg] from 0 hour after blood
collection to 24 hours should be within +/-8% (RET#≥0.010x106/µL).

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison data was collected on RET-He parameter on the XE-2100
and compared to the CHr parameter on the Bayer Advia 120. The study
included 319 samples that included samples with high WBC counts, lipemia,
high bilirubin, platelet clumps, NRBC, atypical lymphocytes, immature
granulocytes, blast forms, left shift, atypical/abnormal lymphocytes, iron
deficiency, thalassemia, etc. Overall, the XE RET-He parameter showed
excellent correlation with the CHr parameter. The correlation (r=0.98)
concurred with other evaluation studies ranging from r-values of 0.94-0.96.
These conclusions point to the fact that the RET-He parameter on the XE-
2100 showed excellent correlation the CHr parameter, the predicate method.
