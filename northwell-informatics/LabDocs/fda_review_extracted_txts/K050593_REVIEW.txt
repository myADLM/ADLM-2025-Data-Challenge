ACON BAR II One Step Barbiturate Test Strip
ACON BAR II One Step Barbiturate Test Device
G. Regulatory Information:
1. Regulation section:
21 CFR §862.3150: Test System, Barbiturate
2. Classification:
Class II
3. Product code:
DIS
4. Panel:
Toxicology (91)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
This device is used in the diagnosis and treatment of drug use or overdose.
2. Indication(s) for use:
“The ACON BAR II One Step Barbiturates Test Strip and the ACON BAR II One
Step Barbiturates Test Device are rapid chromatographic immunoassays for the
qualitative detection of Barbiturates levels in urine at a designated cutoff
concentration of 300 ng/mL (Secobarbital). They are intended for healthcare
professionals including professionals at point-of-care sites.
This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific
alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical
result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) are the preferred
confirmatory methods.
Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of
abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.”

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
See above.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable, as the test strip and the test device are visually-read single-use
devices.
I. Device Description:
The ACON BAR II One Step Barbiturate Test has two formats: Test Strip and Test
Device. These two formats are manufactured with the same formulation, components,
and manufacturing processes. The Test Strip is labeled and has a maximum dip line
indicator. The Test Device contains a testing strip with minor cosmetic changes (no
dip indicator) in a plastic housing with a specimen well and a window to read the test
results. A dropper is included with the Test Device, but a specimen collection
container is not included with either test format.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
ACON BAR One Step Barbiturates Test Strip and Test Device
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
k012824
3. Comparison with predicate:
The device is similar to or the same as to the previously cleared predicate(s) in the
following ways: test principles, indication for use, cut-off concentration(s), use in
a professional and point-of-care setting, sample matrix, endpoint, manufacturer,
and test time. The tests use a different antibody-antigen system which, in turn,
affects the cross-reactivity and interference of the assay.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
The sponsor did not reference any standards in the submission.
L. Test Principle:
The devices employ lateral flow immunochromatographic technology and are based
on the principle of competitive binding. Barbiturates, if present in concentrations
below the cutoff level, will not saturate the binding sites of antibody-coated particles
in the device. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized
barbiturates-specific conjugate and a colored line will appear in the test line region.
A line will not form if the sample contains drug in excess of the cutoff level because
the drug will saturate all the binding sites of the drug-specific antibody. Each strip in
the device contains a procedural control. Formation of a line in the control line region
indicates that the proper volume of urine has been added and membrane wicking has
occurred. If a line does not form in the control region then the test is not valid and
users are cautioned to repeat the test. A ‘presumptive positive’ is determined by the
appearance of a procedural control line AND no line appearing next to the test region.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Drug-free urine was spiked with secobarbital to concentrations of 150, 450,
and 600 ng/mL; three lots of test strip and test device were tested in replicates
of 10 for three days. Results were read after five minutes as ‘positive’ or as
‘negative’. The tables below summarize the results for both test formats:

600 +100 % 100 100 100
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. The assay is intended for qualitative use.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device has an internal process control. A red line appearing in the control
region confirms sufficient sample volume, adequate membrane wicking, and
that the correct technique has been used. Users are informed not to interpret
the test if a line does not form in the control region.
Control standards are not supplied with this device but the manufacturer
recommends the use of commercially available controls. It is good laboratory
practice to confirm the test procedure and to verify proper test performance.
Users should follow all applicable guidelines for testing QC materials.
d. Detection limit:
See Assay Cutoff section below.

e. Analytical specificity:
A wide variety of compounds (n=251, see package insert for a complete list)
at 100 ug/mL were tested in drug-free urine and secobarbital positive urine
and showed no cross-reactivity.
f. Assay cut-off:
To test the analytical sensitivity of the test around the claimed cutoff
concentration, drug-free urine was spiked with secobarbital to concentrations
of 150, 225, 300, 375, 450, and 600 ng/mL. Thirty tests were tested from three
lots (n=90 total). Results were read after five minutes as ‘positive’ or as
‘negative’ and are shown below as the average of the three lots.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Urine samples (n=300) were collected from presumed non-user volunteers and
known positive specimens were obtained from several clinical laboratories.
Drug positive samples and about 10% of the negative samples were confirmed
by GC/MS or HPLC. Specimens were coded, randomized, and blinded for
side-by-side comparisons between ACON BAR II Test Strip, ACON BAR II
Test Device, and the Predicate. The results are shown in the tables below:
