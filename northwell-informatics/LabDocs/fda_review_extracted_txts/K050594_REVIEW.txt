2. Indication(s) for use:
The Nano-Check ™ DAT 5 Multi Drug Screening Test for Marijuana,
Opiates, Cocaine, Methamphetamine and Phencyclidine is a rapid, self-
controlled immunoassay for the qualitative detection of Cannabinoids (THC),
Opiates (OPI), Benzoylecgonine (COC), Methamphetamine (mAMP) and
Phencyclidine (PCP) compounds and their metabolites in human urine. The
detection limits (cut-off concentrations of this test are as follows:
Cannabinoids at 50 ng/ml, Opiates at 2000 ng/ml, Cocaine at 300ng/ml,
Methamphetamine at 1000 ng/ml and Phencyclidine at 25 ng/ml). This assay
is intended for Professional and Laboratory In-Vitro Use Only.
3. Special condition for use statement(s):
The Nano-Check ™ DAT 5 Multi Drug Screening Test provides only a
preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
chromatography/Mass spectrometry is the preferred confirmatory method.
Other chemical confirmation methods are available. Clinical consideration
and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result,
particularly when preliminary positive results are used.
The assay is not designated for use in point-of-care settings.
Tests for opiates cannot distinguish between abused drugs and certain
prescribed medications.
Certain foods or medications may interfere with tests for amphetamines and
opiates and cause false positive results.
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Not applicable. The device is a visually read single-use device.
I. Device Description:
The product is a single-use device in a cassette format. Operators add several drops
of the sample to the sample well. The test reaction is initiated by movement of the
sample through the test strip.

L. Test Principle:
The test employs lateral flow immunochromatographic technology.
Drug in the sample and drug-labeled conjugate (containing a chromagen) compete
for antibody binding sites in the test area of the test strip. Binding of drug in the
sample causes the absence of a line at the test area, i.e., a positive result. When
drug is not present in the sample, the drug-labeled conjugate binds at the test line,
resulting in formation of a line, i.e., a negative result. The absence or presence of
the line is determined visually by the operator.
The device also has an internal process control which indicates that an adequate
volume of sample has been added and that the immunochromatographic strip is
intact.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Drug free samples were spiked with the five drugs to achieve the
concentration of either -50% cutoff or +50% cutoff levels. Ten samples,
each containing a different set of concentration combinations for the 5
drugs and blind –labeled samples, were tested on duplicated devices by
three operators. All tests that applied the +50% cutoff urine sample were
detected positive by all three operators, and all tests of -50% cutoff urine
samples were detected negative by all three operators. Results of study
presented below.

c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
Control materials are required but are not specifically identified in
the labeling.
The device has an internal process control. Users are instructed to
follow federal, state, and local guidelines when determining when to
run external controls.
Stability studies are summarized for the controls. The sponsor
specifies the concentrations of materials evaluated in the studies, the
frequency of testing, the method for testing the materials,
environmental conditions of storage, and acceptance criteria for the
study. Accelerated studies are being used by the sponsor to estimate
the expiration date; however, on-going real time studies are being
performed.
d. Detection limit:
Sensitivity of this assay is characterized by validating performance
around the claimed cutoff concentration of the assay, including a
determination of the lowest concentration of drug that is capable of
producing a positive result.
This information appears in the table below.

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking various concentrations of
similarly structured drug compounds into drug-free urine /a negative
control. By analyzing various concentration of each compound the
sponsor determined the concentration of the drug that produced a
response approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the
assay. Results of those studies appear in the table(s) below:
