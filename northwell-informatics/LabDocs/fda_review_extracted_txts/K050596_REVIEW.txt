K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The Quantia A1-AT reagent is a goat serum anti-human alpha 1 – antitrypsin
which reacts specifically with the alpha 1 – antitrypsin of the sample to yield an
insoluble aggregate which can be measured by turbidimetry. Results are
expressed in mg/dL or g/L based on the International Reference Material CRM
470.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was performed on an AEROSET® System using the
Quantia Proteins Control (low and High) and a mixture of both, run in
duplicate twice a day over 20 days (n=80). This experiment was
performed by one operator on one site with one lot of reagent.

Linearity testing was performed on an AEROSET® System using a
serum sample containing 280 mg/dL of A1-AT diluted in physiologic
saline at 10 different dilutions. Each dilution was analyzed in
quintuplicate. Testing was done with the automatic and without
automatic rerun capability. The reported means were calculated from the
pooled results. Data showed a regression equation Y = 1.001X – 0.3, r2
of 0.9995 for the “without the automatic rerun capability.” Linearity was
set at 25 to 300 mg/dL
The AEROSET® System can automatically rerun samples with results
above the upper limit of the valid range (300 mg/dL) at 1:5 sample
dilutions. . The instrument then automatically recalculates the new
sample result. To assess the extended linearity range, a serum spiked
with partially purified Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (Sigma) was prepared. Ten
dilutions in physiologic saline were done and analyzed in quintuplicate.
The regression equation for the automatic rerun capability showed Y =
0.994X + 5, r2 = 0.9984. Linearity was set at 25 to 1261 mg/dL.
The graphs showed the curves are linear on both settings.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
The reference material is the BCR Reference Material Proteins, CRM
470. The calibrator is supplied by Strategic BioSolutions. Values are
assigned based on CRM 470 CAP/IFCC Lot 91/0619. The concentration
of A1-AT of each new lot of product is tested and reviewed by the
Quality Control Department of Biokit, using the Quantia A1-AT
reagents. Once this lyophilized material is reconstituted, it is aliquoted
and stored frozen at -20oC. Two lots of Quantia A1-AT are used to test
the concentration of each new lot of calibrators. The concentration value
of each new lot of Quantia Proteins Standard obtained has to be within
±10% of the initial value stated by Strategic solutions.
The controls are bulk manufactured by BioRad which has been cleared
(k851202/A1) under the trade name Lypochek Immunology Plus
Control. Target values and acceptance ranges are assigned to each level
of Quantia Proteins Control by the Quality Control Department of
Biokit. Two different lots of Reagent and one lot of calibrator are used.
Upon calibration, each level of the new lot of Quantia Proteins Control
to be assigned is tested 10 times with each lot of reagent. The acceptance
value is the target value ± 20% for both controls (low and high levels).
Stability studies were performed and the following conclusions were
obtained:
• On-Board Instrument Stability – The reagents Quantia A1-AT
4

--- Page 5 ---
Buffer (R1) and Quantia A1-AT Reagent (R2) are stable on –
board the instrument for 5 weeks at 15oC.
• Calibration Stability – The data and the graph indicate that the
calibration is stable for at least 30 days.
• Reconstituted Control Stability – The data indicate that Quantia
Proteins Control I and II is stable for at least 15 days at 2-8oC
after reconstitution.
• Reagent Shelf-Life Stability – Shelf life stability of the reagents
was conducted up to 18 months with three different lots.
Recovery showed minimal change from baseline and the final
shelf-life stability was 12 months at 2-8oC.
d. Detection limit:
Detection limit was calculated by running 30 replicates of physiologic
saline on an AEROSET® System. The mean and the standard deviation
were calculated. The detection limit is defined as the mean reported
value for the physiologic saline plus 2 SD. The Detection Limit was
found to be 0.38 mg/dL.
Limit of quantification was also performed on an AEROSET® System
using 5 dilutions of the 31 mg/dL Quantia Proteins Standard in
physiologic saline. Each dilution was run in quintuplicate. The data
support the claim for a limit of quantification of 25 mg/dL. A limit of
quantification is the smallest concentration of unknown that can be
reliably be quantified by the instrumental method.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference: Interference testing was performed on an AEROSET®
System by spiking a sample containing A1-AT. For each interfering
substance, the sample was split in two aliquots, one spiked with a
concentrated interfering substance and the other with the control buffer.
Each aliquot was analyzed 10 times with a single lot of Quantia A1-AT
reagent. No significant interference was observed in:
• Hemoglobin up to 460 mg/dL
• Bilirubin up to 19.6 mg/dL
• Triglycerides up to 1327 mg/dL
• Turbidity of sample up to 2.33 AU/cm at 660 nm.
• Rheumatoid Factor interference is below 10% up to 800 IU/mL.
No cross-reactivity studies have been conducted with heterophile
antibodies.
