K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI/NCCLS EP5-A, EP6-A, EP7-A and EP9-A2.
L. Test Principle:
The Quantia Beta-2-microglobulin reagent is a suspension of polystyrene latex
particles of uniform size coated with the IgG fraction of an anti-human β -M specific
2
serum. When a sample containing β -Mis mixed with the reagent, a clear
2
agglutination occurs which can be measured by turbidimetry. Absorbance readings
are taken at wavelengths of 572 nm. β -Mresults are reported in mg/L.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i. Precision:
Precision was performed on an AEROSET® system using three samples.
The samples were Quantia Proteins Control I (low control, 0.7 – 1.3
mg/L), Control II (high control, 5.0 – 7.0 mg/L) and a negative serum
sample spiked with pure β -M at 10-15 mg/L. The samples were run in
2
duplicate twice a day over twenty days (n=80) following the NCCLS EP5-
A guidelines. The precision study met the acceptance criteria for all three
samples which were < 5% for “Within Run CV” and < 6% for “Total
CV”.

The mean values given above are absorbance values. A high SD was seen
for the highest level of calibrator (16 mg/L) and high CV was seen for the
lowest level of calibrator (0.25 mg/L). The sponsor pointed out that the
quadruplicate runs performed for the linearity study gave a standard
deviation of 0.017 for the 16 mg/L sample; and a CV of 2% for the 0.25
mg/L sample.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed on an AEROSET® system using a serum
sample containing around 20 mg/L of β -M diluted in physiologic saline at
2
different % dilutions (80%, 50%, 30%, 15%, 8% and 4%). Each dilution was
analyzed in quadruplicate. The AEROSET® automatically reruns samples
above 16 mg/L using a 1:6 dilution of the sample volume and for samples
below 0.25 mg/L by adding 10 times more sample than the regular test.
Without rerun, the linearity studies together with the limit of quantification
test demonstrated acceptable CVs and inaccuracies within the interval
concentrations 0.25 – 22.2 mg/L. In order to prevent prozone problems, the
claim for the upper limit of the test range has been decreased to 16 mg/L.
Within this range, 0.25-16.0 mg/L, the test has a slope of 1.00, an intercept of
0.0 mg/L and a correlation coefficient (r2) 0.9995. With the automatic re-run,
the linearity claims were extended from 0.02 – 100 mg/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability: The reference standard for β -M is the WHO international standard
2
for β -M (1st international standard preparation).

Controls: The bulk product for the Control material is manufactured by
BioRad and the product has been 510(K) cleared (k851202/A1) under the
name LYPHOCHEK IMMUNOLOGY PLUS CONTROL. The lyophilized vials are
purchased unlabeled from BioRad. The vials are labeled and packaged at
Biokit. The target values and acceptance ranges to each level of controls are
assigned at the Quality Control Department of Biokit with an AEROSET

Instrument using one lot of calibrator and two different lots of reagents.
Calibrator: The calibrator is manufactured from commercially purified and
concentrated β -M using the Quantia Beta-2 Reagents on an ILab 600 System
2
(k980757). The purified and concentrated β -M is diluted in a buffer to a
2
concentration of 4 mg/L ± 5% by comparison with a house standard. The
house standard is traceable to the reference standard, the 1st WHO
international standard preparation. Value assignment procedure was provided.
System uses a five-point calibration curve. The analyzer automatically
prepares the 5 different concentrations of calibrator from the single calibrator
level vial provided at 4 mg/L.
Stability: On-board instrument stability was performed on reagents which
showed 5 weeks stability for both reagents (R1 and R2). The reagent shelf-
life stability at 2-8º C was also performed and the reagents were found to be
stable for 19 months at 2-8º C. The calibration was shown to be stable for 30
days. The reconstituted controls were shown to be stable for 15 days at 2-8º.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit was determined by running 30 replicates of physiological
saline on an AEROSET® system. The detection limit is defined as the mean
reported value for the physiologic saline plus 2 standard deviations. The
detection limit is claimed as 0.046 mg/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was preformed by spiking a serum sample containing β -
2
M with the various interfering substances and assayed on an AEROSET®
system. The acceptance criteria for the percent of recovery β -M in the spiked
2
sample are within 95-105% of the unspiked sample. Based on the acceptance
criteria, no significant interference was found with hemoglobin up to 482
mg/dL, bilirubin up to 20.8 mg/dL, trigylcerides up to 1327 mg/dL and
turbidity of the sample up to 2.18 AU/cm at 660 nm. Interference by
rheumatoid factor (RF) is below 10% for RF concentration up to 288 IU/ml.
No cross-reactivity studies were performed with heterophile antibodies and
have updated the package insert with the disclaimer statement “no cross-
reactivity studies have been conducted with heterophile antibodies”.
f. Assay cut-off:
No assay cut off was provided.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The Method Comparison study was performed with 105 patient serum
samples covering all the clinical range (1.01 to 101.1 mg/L of β -M) on the
2
new device and the predicate device, IL Test Beta-2 Microglobulin, (k943686)
on an ILab 900 instrument which was cleared in k932467. The samples were
obtained from two hospitals in Spain. The required specifications were: slope
1.0 ± 0.20; r (correlation coefficient) ≥ 0.950. Linear regression analysis

showed a slope of 0.876 (95% CI: 0.868 to 0.886) and an intercept of 0.59
(95%CI: 0.385 to 0.772). The correlation coefficient was 0.9986.
b. Matrix comparison:
The plasma to serum correlation data was generated with 30 paired samples
on an AEROSET® system. The recovery met the acceptance criteria which is
±15% of the serum sample result. The correlation coefficient was 0.996, the
intercept was -0.091 (95%CI: -0.154 to -0.029) and the slope was 0.977
(95%CI: 0.942 to 1.012).
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not provided
b. Clinical specificity:
Not provided
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not provided
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The package insert provides literature reference for expected values for normal
population. In the serum or plasma of apparently healthy persons, the normal
range is approximately 0.97 to 2.64 mg/L. Due to the many variables which may
affect results, each laboratory is expected to establish their own normal range.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
