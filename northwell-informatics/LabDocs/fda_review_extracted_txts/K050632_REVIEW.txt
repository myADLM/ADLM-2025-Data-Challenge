M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run precision was performed on two systems B23 and B44 for
ten days with two runs and two cups per run.

Calibrator 10 20 40 81.29 1.67 2.1 2.13 2.6
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A total of ten samples were prepared by mixing 0.9% saline and a high
serum linearity pool that was prepared in-house. From the derived
theoretical values (x) versus obtained values (y) with levels ranging
from 7 mg/dL to 85 mg/dL, the following regression equation was
obtained: y = 1.01207x – 0.22402, r = 0.9987.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
The single level ADVIA Chemistry HDL/LDL Cholesterol calibrator is
used to calibrate the ADVIA IMS DHDL method. This calibrator was
previously approved for use on the ADVIA 1650 and 2400 systems.
The calibrator is traceable via patient sample correlation to the
Designated Comparison Method established by the National
Cholesterol Education Program.

d. Detection limit:
Based upon the linearity data, the analytical range was established as
7 – 90 mg/dL
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference was evaluated by spiking human serum pools with
hemoglobin, unconjugated bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, and
triglycerides. Intermediate dilutions were determined by diluting the
spiked sample with undiluted sample. The observed recovery was
considered to be of no clinical significance if the deviation for these
potential interferences was ≤10%. Bilirubin (unconjugated) up to a level
of 30 mg/dL, bilirubin (conjugated) up to a level of 20 mg/dL,
hemoglobin up to a level of 500 mg/dL, and lipids up to a level of 1000
mg/dL did not interfere with the assay.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Correlation was evaluated with human serum or plasma as appropriate
in a protocol similar to CLSI document EP9-A. Regression data for
each method indicate the linear least-squares fit between the ADVIA
IMS system (y) and the predicate system/method (x).
