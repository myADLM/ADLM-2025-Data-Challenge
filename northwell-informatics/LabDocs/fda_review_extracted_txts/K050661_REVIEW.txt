L. Test Principle:
Factor II (prothrombin), is a vitamin K-dependent plasma protein that is synthesized
in the liver and circulates in plasma as an inactive molecule. During coagulation FII
is converted to the active form, factor IIa (thrombin), by Factor Xa.
Congenital deficiency of factor II is a very rate inherited disorder that causes in
general a mild to moderate bleeding tendency. Factor II deficiencies may also be
acquired secondarily due to other diseases such as hyperfibrinolysis, DIC and liver
disease.

Factor II activity in a patient’s plasma is determined by performing a modified
prothrombin time test. Patient plasma is diluted with Owren’s Buffer and mixed with
a substrate plasma deficient in factor II. The mixture is assayed by the PT clotting
procedure. The clotting time is dependent upon the concentration of factor II in the
patient plasma. The clotting time is compared to a standard curve prepared prior to
assay from dilutions of normal pooled plasma or commercial reference plasma mixed
with the same factor II deficient plasma.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was performed on an ACL Advance (K002400), the ACL Futura
Coagulation Analyzer (K951891), the ACL 9000 (K000053), ACL 300
(K881367), ACL 3000 (K912087), ACL TOP (K033414), ELECTRA 1400C
(K944227), ELECTRA 1600 (K931206), and the ELECTRA 1800C
(K962664) using HemosIL RecombiPlasTin (K012768) PT reagent and 2
levels of controls: HemosIL Normal Control (K021023) and the HemosIL
Special Test Control Level 2 (K040359). On the ACL 9000, ACL Futura,
ACL TOP, and ELECTRA 1600C, each control was run in replicates of four
twice a day for 10 days (n=80). On the ACL 300, ACL 3000, ACL Advance,
ELECTRA 1400C, and ELECTRA 1800C, each control was run in replicates
of four twice a day for five days (n=40). Within run, between run and total
%CV was calculated per NCCLS EP5-T2. %CV were within the acceptance
criteria (Normal <10%, Special Test Level 2 <17%).

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The following studies were presented to demonstrate the equivalent performance of
HemosIL Factor II Deficient Plasma with various PT reagents on representative IL
instruments:
1. 49 patient samples spanning in range from 7 – 171% were test on an ACL
Advance using HemosIL RecombiPlasTin (reference) vs. HemosIL PT-
Fibrinogen HS (test) (K923921) reagent. Results are statistically similar (y =
0.8916 x -18.676, r= 0.9653).
2. The same testing pool was also run on an ACL Advance using HemosIL
RecombiPlasTin (reference) vs. HemosIL PT-Fibrinogen HS Plus (test)
(K933252) reagent. Results are statistically similar (y = 1.1194 x -13.560, r=
0.9846).
3. The same testing pool was also run on an ACL Advance using HemosIL
RecombiPlasTin (reference) vs. HemosIL PT-Fibrinogen Recombinant
(K981479) reagent. Results are statistically similar (y = 1.0551 x – 1.2247, r=
0.9796).
4. 40 patient samples spanning in range from 15 – 215% were test on an ELECTRA
using HemosIL RecombiPlasTin (reference) vs. Hemoliance Brain
Thromboplastin reagent. Results are statistically similar (y = 0.9650 x -2.1467, r=
0.9633).
Results demonstrated that the performance of HemosIL Factor II Deficient Plasma is
statistically equivalent between PT reagents.
