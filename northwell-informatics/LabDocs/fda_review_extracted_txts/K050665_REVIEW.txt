K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The N Antisera to Human Complement Factors (C3c, C4) uses immunonephelometry
to measure C3 and C4 in human serum or plasma. C3 or C4 in the sample combines
with specific antibodies to C3 or C4 to form immune complexes. These complexes
scatter a beam of light passes through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light
is proportional to the concentration of the respective analyte in the sample. C3 or C4
concentrations are automatically calculated from multi-point calibration curves.

Within-run, run-to-run and total precision studies were performed
according to NCCLS Guideline EP5-A. N/T protein controls (low,
medium and high) and two serum pools (low and high) were assayed
in quadruplicate, two runs per day for 4 days. Results are
summarized in the table below.

b. Matrix comparison:
Anti-coagulant effects were evaluated by comparing EDTA and
heparin plasma samples with serum samples. Twenty paired EDTA
plasma/serum samples and 49 paired heparin plasma/serum samples
were analyzed for 3 runs using the C3 or C4 reagent on the BN II
System. Passing-Bablock regression analysis was used to evaluate
the results which are summarized below.
