K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
L. Test Principle:
Whole blood or cord blood, on a filter spot or collected into an EDTA or heparinized
tube, is treated with a Hb Elution Solution to inhibit methemoglobin formation. The
solution is then placed on an agarose gel containing RESOLVE Ampholytes pH 6-8,
and the gel is placed on the electrofocusing unit.
When an electrical current is applied to the gel, the hemoglobin variants possessing
individual isoelectric points (pl’s), migrate through the gel. When an individual
variant’s pl equals the pH in the gel, it ceases migration and forms a discrete band.
When all hemoglobin bands have focused, the gel is fixed in trichloroacetic acid.
Hemoglobin bands can be visualized by using the JB-2 Staining System. Stained or
unstained gels can be scanned by a densitometer to estimate the percentages of
normal and variant hemoglobins.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Variation was estimated by measuring the distance of certain Hb bands of
FASC controls used in the comparison studies. The analysis of variance was
used to calculate the following:
n Average Within-gel Between-gel Total precision
distance (mm) precision
Precision Within laboratory
(CV%) (%CV) (%CV)

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The RESOLVE Hemoglobin system was compared to HPLC. Samples included
60% from normal patients, 20% from hemoglobin combinations having Hb S
and 20% from other hemoglobin variants to include Hb C, D, E, G-
Philadelphia, α-thalassemia and β-thalassemia.
