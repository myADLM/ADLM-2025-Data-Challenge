I. Device Description:
The Good Biotech Corp. Duet hs-CRP reagent consists of two wet reagents. Reagent
1 is a buffering solution and reagent 2 contains latex particles coated with anti-CRP
duck monoclonal antibodies. Duck anti-CRP IgY is purified from duck yolk. The
host ducks selected for immunization are domestic stock and have been inoculated to
prevent avian-associated diseases.
The Good Biotech Duet hs-CRP is a six level calibrator kit that is composed of
stabilized human serum to which human C-reactive protein, preservatives and
stabilizers have been added. The calibrator sets are prepared from human sera which
were tested by FDA acceptable methods and found to be negative for HBsAg, anti-
HIV 1 and 2 antibodies, and anti-HCV antibody. The calibrator set is a combination
of 2 previously cleared calibrator sets - k021882 and k021757. The controls used in
this submission were previously cleared under k022725.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle:
When CRP in a sample encounters the latex microparticles sensitized with duck anti-
CRP IgY, agglutination among the latex microparticles occurs based on the antigen-
antibody reaction. Agglutination increases and is detected by the absorbance change
at 570 nm. The absorbance change is proportional to the CRP concentration of the
sample and is recorded by an autoanalyzer. The actual CRP concentration of the
sample is determined by the interpolation of the calibration curve obtained by
standard samples with known CRP concentrations.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was conducted using three quality control materials (low,
medium and high). Within-run precision was conducted by
analyzing each of the three controls in replicates of 20. Day-to-day
precision was conducted for each of the three controls in triplicate

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was conducted with dilutions of a CRP standard that
ranged from 1 to 200 mg/L. The assays were run in triplicate. The
sponsors acceptance criteria is a R2 value greater than 0.95. The
results showed that the Duet hs-CRP LIT assay was linear from 0-
200 mg/L and revealed an equation
Y= 200.47X + 1.2308 with a R2 =0.9997.
The sponsor also conducted a prozone hook effect study with the
Duet hs-CRP LIT assay using serum samples with CRP
concentrations (dilutions of a CRP standard) that ranged from 0 to
838 mg/L. There was no prozone phenomenon observed up to 800
mg/L.
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
The calibrators that are used with the Duet hs-CRP LIT assay and
are included with this submission are a merge of 2 previously cleared
calibrators, K021882 (CRPex HS CRP Calibrator Set) and K021757
(CRPex BR CRP Calibrator Set). The Duet hs-CRP calibrator set is a
six-level liquid calibrator set. Levels 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Duet hs-
CRP Calibrator Set are actually 1, 4, 5 and 6 of the CRPex HS CRP
calibrator set. Levels 5 and 6 of the of the Duet hs-CRP Calibrator
Set are actually 4 and 5 of the CRPex BR CRP calibrator set.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit was determined using the zero calibrator. The
zero calibrator was run in replicates of 20 with the Duet hs-CRP LIT
assay. The detection limit of 0.041 mg/L CRP was calculated as 2
standard deviations above the mean response of the zero calibrator.
Ten serum samples containing low concentrations of CRP ranging in
concentration from 0.1 to 0.59 mg/L were tested in replicates of ten.
The percent CV was plotted as a function of analyte concentration
and the CRP concentration (0.3 mg/L) for which the CV was 20%
was defined as the functional sensitivity.

e. Analytical specificity:
Hemoglobin (up to 805 mg/dL), bilirubin C and F (up to 45 mg/dL)
and lipemia (up to 10 g/L Liposyn) were found not to interfere with
the assay. Interference was defined by the sponsor as recovery of
more than +/- 5% of the initial measured value.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor conducted a method comparison study with the
predicate device [(K-Assay CRP (3) assay)] with a total of 93 non
traceable serum samples (64 of which fell in the high sensitivity
range of 1 to 10 mg/L). The samples ranged from 1 to 200 mg/L.
The following linear regressions were derived from the regression
analysis:
Duet hs-CRP LIT Assay= 0.955X + 0.938 with a correlation
coefficient of 0.998, where X is the predicate device for the entire 93
samples of CRP concentration ranging from 1- 200 mg/L.
Duet hc-CRP LIT Assay=1.08X + 0.226 with a correlation
coefficient of 0.996, where X is the predicate device for the 64
samples of CRP concentration ranging from 0-10 mg/L.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable because this assay is to be used with serum samples
only and should be collected in red top tubes without serum
separator.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical sensitivity:
Not Applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not Applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a and b are not applicable)
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not Applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor uses the IFCC/BCR/CAP reference material CRM 470 that states
the reference range for CRP in serum of less than 5 mg/L. The sponsor also
states that the reference interval varies with populations studies and calibrators
used and that individual laboratories should establish their own reference
interval.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
