I. Device Description:
The ABX Erytrol is an in-vitro diagnostic blood control composed of human erythrocytes
and mammalian leukocytes in a plasma-like fluid with preservatives. The ABX erythrol
is composed of stable materials that provide a means of monitoring the performance of
ABX hematology analyzers offering the nucleated red blood cell count (NRBC)
parameter.
