H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Oxycodone Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay with
100 and 300 ng/mL cutoffs. The assay is intended for use in the qualitative and semi-
quantitative analyses of oxycodone and its metabolite, oxymorphone in human urine.
The Oxycodone calibrators are used to calibrate the oxycodone enzyme immunoassay for
drug detection in human urine. The Oxycodone controls are used to validate the assay.
The assay provides a simple and rapid analytical screening procedure to detect
oxycodone and its metabolite in human urine.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Oxycodone Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay with
100 and 300 ng/mL cutoffs. The assay is intended for use in the qualitative and semi-
quantitative analyses of oxycodone and its metabolite, oxymorphone in human urine.
The Oxycodone calibrators are used to calibrate the oxycodone enzyme immunoassay for
drug detection in human urine. The Oxycodone controls are used to validate the assay.
The assay provides a simple and rapid analytical screening procedure to detect
oxycodone and its metabolite in human urine.
The assay is designed for professional use with a number of automated clinical chemistry
analyzers. Performance data submitted was obtained using the Hitachi 717 analyzer.
The Oxycodone Enzyme Immunoassay provides only a preliminary analytical test result.
A more specific alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred
confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
applied to any drug-of-abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are
used.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription, professional use only in clinical chemistry laboratories.
The assay is not designated for use in point-of-care settings.

Semi-quantitative results may be helpful in estimating the concentrations of drug(s) in
samples. This can aid users when they are preparing dilutions of the samples for further
analysis.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced
L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on competition for anti-oxycodone antibody binding sites between
oxycodone in the sample and oxycodone conjugated to glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PDH). In the absence of free drug in the sample, the antibody
binds the conjugated oxycodone thus decreasing the enzymatic activity of the
G6PDH. The G6PDH activity is measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm because
of conversion of NAD to NADH.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the qualitative and semi-quantitative assays was evaluated by assaying
calibrator and control material in replicates of 6 twice per day for 10 days (for total n =
120 per sample). All studies were performed on a Hitachi 717 analyzer. Results are
summarized below for each cutoff for qualitative and semi-quantitative protocols (units =
ng/mL).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrators and controls are prepared by spiking oxycodone into a processed, drug-
free human urine matrix to the following targeted concentrations (which are confirmed by
GC/MS analysis):
Material 100 ng/mL Cutoff 300 ng/mL Cutoff
Negative Calibrator 0 ng/mL 0 ng/mL
Low Calibrator 75 ng/mL 150 ng/mL
Cutoff Calibrator 100 ng/mL 300 ng/mL
Intermediate Calibrator 225 ng/mL 500 ng/mL
High Calibrator 300 ng/mL 800 ng/mL
Control Level I 75 ng/mL 225 ng/mL
Control Level II 125 ng/mL 375 ng/mL
Accelerated stability studies were described and support stability of > 8 months.
d. Detection limit:
Precision around the cutoff for the qualitative assays (100 and 300 ng/mL cutoffs) was
evaluated by spiking 7 negative urine samples to 25% above the cutoffs (125 and 375
ng/mL, respectively) and 7 negative urine samples to 25% below the cutoffs (75 and 225
ng/mL, respectively). All samples above the cutoff tested positive and all samples below
the cutoff tested negative.
Analytical sensitivity, defined as the lowest concentration that can be differentiated from
the negative urine with 95% confidence, was determined to be 7.5 ng/mL for the 100
ng/mL cutoff and 15 ng/mL for the 300 ng/mL cutoff.
e. Analytical specificity:
Various potentially interfering substances were evaluated to determine whether they
interfere with assay results. Test compounds were spiked into the drug-free calibrator to
various concentrations and evaluated against the cutoff calibrators. The labeling lists the
concentration of each compound that gave a response approximately equal to that of the
6
