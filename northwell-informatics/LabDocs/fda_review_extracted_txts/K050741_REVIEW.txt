510(k)s, July 22, 2000
L. Test Principle:
The urine sample is added to the sample well and migrates by capillary action along
the membrane to the test region. Specimens containing hCG will react with the
antibody-hCG-colored conjugate and form a pink line at the test line region of the
membrane. Absence of this line at the test region is interpreted as a negative result.
As a procedural control, a pink line should always appear in the control region.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To assess the precision of the assay, the sponsor analyzed urine samples
spiked with hCG at concentrations of 0, 10, 15, 20, 40, and 100 mIU/mL.
Twenty samples were tested at each concentration. Results were as follows:
Spiked
Concentration 0 10 15 20 40 100
(mIU/mL)
Negative 20 20 19 1 0 0
Positive 0 0 1 19 20 20
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This assay is standardized to the World Health Organization’s 4th International
Standard (75/589) for Chorionic Gonadotropin.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor’s claimed detection limit is 20 mIU/mL. To assess the detection
limit, the sponsor analyzed urine samples spiked with hCG at concentrations
of 0, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 mIU/mL. Twenty samples were tested at each
concentration. Results were as follows:
Spiked
Concentration 0 10 15 20 25 30
(mIU/mL)
Negative 20 20 19 0 0 0
Positive 0 0 1 20 20 20
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was tested at 0, 20, and 100 mIU/mL hCG with LH (300
mIU/mL), FSH (1,000 mIU/mL), and TSH (1,000mIU/mL) with no variation
from expected results. In addition, the sponsor investigated the effect of the
following endogenous and exogenous compounds: hemoglobin, bilirubin,
albumin, acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, ascorbic acid, atropine, caffeine,
Gentisic acid, and glucose. Again, there was no variation from the expected
results.
f. Assay cut-off:
See detection limit above.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To assess the accuracy of IND Diagnostic One-Step hCG test kit, a
commercially available qualitative test kit (ICON hCG) was used to compare
with IND Diagnostic One-Step hCG test kit in 803 unaltered clinical urine
samples. Results were as follows:
IND result
+ -
+ 484 1
ICON result
- 7 311
Agreement among positives was > 99%
Agreement among negatives was 98%
Overall agreement was 99%
The discrepant samples were further tested with a quantitative hCG method
with the following results:
