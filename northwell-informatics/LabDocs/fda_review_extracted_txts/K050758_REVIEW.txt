510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
K050758
B. Purpose for Submission:
New Device
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Chempaq A/S, Chempaq XBC Analyzer
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Quantitative, White Blood Cells (WBC), Granulocytes (GRN), Lymphocytes (LYM),
Monocytes (MON), Total Hemoglobin (Hb)
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Chempaq XBC Analyzer is an automated differential cell counter. The device
consists of the following components and accessories : (1) a single use cartride,
called the Particle Analyzer and Qualifier (PAQ) ; and (2) a stationary Reader
with a docking station, called a Cradle. The PAQ is connected to the Cradle by a
simple push fit. The PAQ includes all required reagents and will, when connected
to the Cradle, perform all simple manipulations required for the analysis. The
sample minipulation is facilitated by electrical and pneumatic connections
between the PAQ and the Cradle.
2. Principles of Operation:
The Chempaq XBC Analyzer counts and sizes blood cells by impedance cell
sizing, also known as the Coulter Sizing or Coulter Counting Principle. This
concept is broadly accepted as being used in most hematology analyzers and
particle counting equipment. The method is based on measurable changes in the
electrical impedance produced by comparatively non-conductive particles in an
electrolyte.
3. Modes of Operation:
Random access, Point of Care

4. Specimen Identification:
Not Available, Manual numbering
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The Chempaq XBC Analyzer analyzes a single drop (20 µL) of blood usually
taken from the fingertip or a well mixed sample of venous blood already taken
from the patient. Capillary blood sample from the fingertip is obtained by
standard techniques and any lancing system that provides sufficient blood.
Venous samples should be collected in containers carrying salts of EDTA as
anticoagulant in a concentration of 3.7-5.4 µmol/mL of blood. The blood sample
should be at room temperature and well mixed. A pipette capable of safely
delivering a single drop of blood should be used to apply to the blood inlet of the
PAQ.
Heparin cannot be used as an anticoagulant.
6. Calibration:
The Chempaq XBC Analyzer is factory calibrated when manufactured. The
method of calibration is traceable to Clin. Lab. Haemat., 16(2), 131-138 (1994)
for WBC and NCCLS standard H15-A3 for Hgb.
7. Quality Control:
External controls are indicated to be necessary to meet conformance with local,
state and federal regulations. An available commercial control is suggested.
8. Software:
The Chempaq XBC Analyzer software is developed only for operating the
instrument and considered to be of moderate level of concern. Algorithms for the
blood cell counts and hemoglobin measurement are included in the software and
validated accordingly.

J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
Accuracy was determined using the predicate device as comparative method.
Readings on the Compaq XBC were made in 3-7 replicates and readings on
the predicate device were made in 3 replicates. The data was collected during
15 days using one Compaq XBC Reader and PAQs stemming from 5 different
lots. The relative differences were calculated using means of both device
readings. The samples were divided into 5 concentration levels of WBC, 4
concentrations levels of LYM, 2 concentrations levels of MON, 5
concentrations levels of GRN and 3 concentrations levels of HGB. The
regression analysis is as follows:
Analyte Regression Correlation Confidence Confidence

WBC y=1.006x + 0.059 109/L r=0.99 0.012 0.094 109/L

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was performed on three blood samples (three levels of
concentration, 20 replicates) using two readers and one batch of PAQs. The
results are as follows:

concentration replicates imprecision SD imprecision CV

Additional precision was determined by analyzing three concentration levels
of a commercial liquid blood control (using one lot) and analyzed on 20
consecutive working days. One Chempaq XBC Reader and one lot of PAQs
were used. The results are as follows:

Interference studies were performed on 6 venous blood samples containing
heparin on 5 Readers. Based on the results it was concluded that there is
interference of heparin and this substance cannot be used as an anticoagulant
for samples used on the Chempaq XBC system.
