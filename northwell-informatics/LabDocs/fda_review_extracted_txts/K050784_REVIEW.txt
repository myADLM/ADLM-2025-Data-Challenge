H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications foe use below.

The Nichols Advantage Aldosterone Assay is intended for in vitro diagnostic
laboratory use with the Nichols Advantage® Specialty System for the quantitative
measurement of aldosterone in human serum, EDTA plasma and extracted urine.
Aldosterone measurements are intended for use in the diagnosis and treatment of
primary aldosteronism (a disorder caused by excessive secretion of aldosterone by
the adrenal gland), hypertension caused by primary aldosteronism, selective
hypoaldosteronism, edematous states and other conditions of electrolyte
imbalance.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
N/A
4. Special instrument requirements:
Nichols Advantage® Specialty System (k961142)
I. Device Description:
Nichols Institute Diagnostics utilizes chemiluminescence acridinium esters as the
label in its specialty chemiluminescence system. Acridinium esters emit light upon
treatment with hydrogen peroxide and an alkaline solution. Trigger 1 solution
contains hydrogen peroxide in dilute acid and the Trigger 2 solution contains dilute
sodium hydroxide. The system automatically injects Trigger 1 and 2 solutions into the
well of the cuvette, which oxidize the acridinium ester. The oxidized product is in an
excited state. The subsequent return to ground state results in emission of light, which
is quantified in two (2) seconds and is expressed in relative light units (RLU) by the
integrated system luminometer.
The human source material used in the preparation of this product has been found
negative for the presence of the antibody to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-I
and HIV-II), HCV and HBV by FDA approved methods.

L. Test Principle:
The aldosterone assay is based upon competitive binding between aldosterone in the
sample and acridinium ester labeled aldosterone (labeled aldosterone) for a specific
mouse monoclonal antibody to human aldosterone. First, sample is incubated with
biotinylated anti-aldosterone monoclonal antibody for 10 minutes at 37 ºC. Next,
labeled aldosterone is added to the reaction mixture. In the second incubation,
aldosterone from the sample competes with labeled aldosterone for binding to the
specific monoclonal antibody. In the third and final 10 minute incubation,
streptavidin-coated magnetic particles and assay buffer are added into the reaction
mixture. Because of the high affinity between biotin to streptavaidin, biotinylated
monoclonal antibody rapidly binds to the streptavidi-coated magnetic particles. The
captured complex bound to the magnetic particles is then washed by the system to
remove unbound components and labeled aldosterone. The cuvette wells containing
the washed magnetic particles are moved into the system luminometer, which
automatically adds trigger 1 and 2, initiating the chemiluminescence reaction. The
light is expressed as relative light units (RLU). The amount of RLU is proportional to
the amount of labeled aldosterone bound to the magnetic particles. The RLU signal
when read-off the stored calibration curve is inversely proportional to the aldosterone
concentration in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

method was estimated using the NCCLS EP5-A method. The data represents
one run per day over 20 days for each extracted urine pool or assay control
run in duplicate. The results are presented in the table below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls and calibrators were reviewed and previously cleared k032188 and
not reviewed with this submission. However the adjusted master curve stable
has gone from 5 days to fourteen days. This was confirmed by testing
calibrators, controls and pools over a 30 day period. Acceptance criteria is
defined as statistically insignificant slope, average change in dose from Day 0
< 10% and change in the lower or upper 95% confidence interval of the slope
< 15%. The controls and pools were within acceptable limits, supporting the
claimed stability of 14 days.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity (Limit of Detection, LOD) was determined by
reading the -2SD response from n=20 replicate measurements of the zero
standard from the stored master curve from several runs and instruments. The
analytical sensitivity for this assay was estimated to be <1.2 ng/dL.
The functional sensitivity (Limits of Quantification (LOQ)) was determined
by detecting the lowest concentration at which an acceptable CV 20% can be
obtained. The functional sensitivity for this assay was estimated to be 3 ng/dL
e. Analytical specificity:
The anti-sera for the assay are very specific for aldosterone and demonstrates
extremely low cross-reactivity to other steroidal compounds in patient
samples. Cross-reactivity in the chart below was calculated on a weight-per-
weight basis at approximately 50% binding intercept or less.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The Nichols Advantage Aldosterone assay was compared to a commercially
available aldosterone RIA method. 118 24-hour urine samples were assayed
by both methods. The range of values observed with the commercial RIA
method was 0.8–80.2 μg/24 hours; and the range of values observed with the
Nichols Advantage Aldosterone method was 0.4-66.7 μg/24 hours. Passing
Bablok regression analysis yielded an equation of y=1.23x-1.19 (95%
confidence intervals of the slope and intercept were 1.2-1.28 and -1.43 to -
0.81, respectively). Pearson’s correlation coefficient of the paired data was r =
0.96 (95% confidence interval was 0.94-0.97).
b. Matrix comparison:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Twenty-four urine samples were collected from 80 (41 females and 39 males)
apparently healthy normal adults 18 to 78 years of age. None of the females were
pregnant, taking birth control pills or on estrogen treatment and none were on any
medications. After square root transformation of the data, the 95% confidence
interval for normal 24-hour urine aldosterone results was as follows: 0.7(0.4 to
1.2) to 23.0 (18.3 to 28.6) μg/24 hours.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
