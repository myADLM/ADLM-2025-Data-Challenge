I. Device Description:
The SPOTCHEM II LDH consists of 25 reagent strips and a test specific
calibration card. The SPOTCHEM II LDH Reagent Strip is composed of a

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra Assay precision was assessed at three levels. Twenty replicates
of the same sample within one analytical run were evaluated at three
levels. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation
(CV) in percent were calculated. An intra assay CV of <5% was
determined to be acceptable.

Inter assay precision was determined by analyzing duplicates of three
different samples in each of ten different runs over ten different
occasions. An inter assay CV of <10% was determined to be
acceptable.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity/calibration curve fit data were generated for a pool that
spanned the linear range of the test. Serial dilution sets were prepared
using 7% BSA and made up fresh and assayed with each of three
calibrated runs. The results at each level of analyte were averaged and
the linear fit was assessed. The linearity claim is based on a percent
deviation of ≤ 5% at the two highest analyte concentrations. The LDH
test was found to be linear from 59.7 to 914 IU/L. Linear fit parameters
were y=1.009x -24.58 r2=0.9976.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
Calibration on the magnetic calibration card was determined by an
internal stability study. The initial shelf-life determinations were
conducted by accelerated aging studies and backed up with real time
aging studies. The shelf life of the magnetic calibration card was
conducted after exposure to real shipping conditions and labeled
storage conditions. The duration of the testing is 25% beyond the
labeled expiration date for an 80% claim.
d. Detection limit:
The minimum detectable LDH activity with an acceptable level of
precision was determined as 100 IU/L.
e. Analytical specificity:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Correlation studies were performed comparing the LDH test results
generated on the SPOTCHEM EZ SP-4430 analyzer against the
results generated from legally marketed tests. The 41 serum samples
spanned from 101 to 553 IU/L. The regression equation was y=0.955x
+ 2.946 and r=0.9964.
b. Matrix comparison:
Correlation studies were performed comparing the LDH test results

serum and whole blood. Eighteen matched samples of serum and
whole blood were analyzed. The regression equation for the 18 serum
