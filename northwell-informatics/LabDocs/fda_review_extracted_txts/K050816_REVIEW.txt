H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The VITEK® 2 Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) is intended to be used
with the VITEK® 2 Systems for the automated quantitative or qualitative
susceptibility testing of isolated colonies for the most clinically significant
aerobic gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp.,
Streptococcus agalactiae, and S. pneumoniae.
The VITEK®2 Gram Positive susceptibility Card is intended for use with the

susceptibility of Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., and Streptococcus
agalactiae to antimicrobial agents when used as instructed in the Online Product
Information.

This submission is for the addition of the antibiotic Meropenem at
concentrations at 0.5, 1, and 4 ug/mL for a calling range of <0.5- >16ug/mL to
the VITEK®2 gram positive susceptibility CARD for the testing of oxacillin
susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis on the
VITEK ®2 Systems.

laboratory aid in the determination of in vitro susceptibility to antimicrobial
agents.
3. Special condition for use statement(s):
Prescription Use only.
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Not applicable
I. Device Description:
Each VITEK® 2 test card contains 64 microwells. A control well, that contains only
microbiological culture medium is resident on all cards, with the remaining wells
containing premeasured amounts of a specific antibiotic combined with culture
medium. A suspension of organism is made in 0.45 % sterile saline from a pure
culture and standardized to a McFarland 0.5 standard using the DensiChek. The
VITEK® 2 automatically fills, seals and places the card into the incubator/reader. The
VITEK® 2 Compact has a manual filling and sealing operation. The VITEK® 2
monitors the growth by optical scanning of each well in the card over a defined
period of time (up to 18 hours) of incubation at 35.5o C. Minimum Inhibitory
Concentration (MIC) readings are performed every 15 minutes. At the completion of
the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the
interpretive category result for each antibiotic contained on the card.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) M7 (M100-S15) “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
Optics systems use visible light to directly measure organism growth. These
transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant
growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure
organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through the well. An
interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for an early reading of results with
an option to incubate up to 18 hours if necessary. The VITEK®2 Susceptibility Card
test is based on the microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration technique with
concentrations equivalent to standard method concentrations. Several parameters
based on the growth characteristics observed are used to provide appropriate input for
the MIC calculations. Discriminate analysis is used to develop the algorithm that
determines the susceptibility result for all antimicrobials on the VITEK® 2 systems.
The MIC result must be linked to an organism identification in order to determine a
category interpretation. A category interpretation will be reported.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Ten on-scale gram positive organisms were tested in triplicate at
each of three sites for three days for an overall inter and intra site
reproducibility of >95%. This testing was performed using both the
manual dilution of the inoculum and also the automatic dilution
method.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the
auto-dilution and the manual method of diluting the organisms. This
included the two recommended QC organisms with the following
results. Although the reference testing included more dilutions than
the VITEK as demonstrated in the table, all testing provided results
with the same mode.

50 results available for each organism. The clinical sites also
performed weekly standardization of the DensiChek used at that site.
All recorded calibrated values were within acceptable parameters.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A comparison of the clinical data was performed to the agar dilution reference
method as described in the CLSI M7. All of the test organisms that provided
results did so in <16 hours in the VITEK® 2 systems. Testing was performed
using the automatic and manual dilution features. In the Clinical testing both
oxacillin susceptible and oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus spp. was tested at
three sites that included both clinical and challenge isolates. A total of 382
Staphylococci were tested but only 160 were oxacillin susceptible. The VITEK
system reports Meropenem as resistant for all methicillin/oxacillin resistant
Staphylococcus spp. as recommended by CLSI and FDA. The performance is
based on evaluating methicillin/oxacillin susceptible Staphylococcus spp. only.
The data in the table below reflects the testing performed on oxacillin-susceptible
Staphylococcus species:

CA is when the interpretation of the VITEK ® 2 results agrees
exactly with the interpretation of the reference method. The CA is
acceptable when compared to the reference method as described in
the FDA guidance document, “Class II Special Controls Guidance
Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems;
Guidance for Industry and FDA”.
Essential agreement can not be determined since the VITEK® 2
system tests less than five dilutions of meropenem.
The challenge set of organisms was also tested at one site using the
manual and auto-dilution methods of inoculation with the following
performance that demonstrated that there was little or no difference
between the two inoculation methods. The table below contains the
data from the two dilution methods of testing oxacillin susceptible
Staphylococcus species:
