serum C-reactive protein analysis.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The following limitation on the use of the High Sensitivity CRP should be noted:
• Screening the entire adult population is not recommended;
• CRP is not a substitute for traditional cardiovascular risk factors;
• Acute coronary syndrome management should not depend on CRP
measurements;
• When being used for risk assessment, patients with persistently unexplained
CRP levels above 10 mg/L should be evaluated for other non-cardiovascular
origins;
• Testing for any risk assessment should not be performed while there is
indication of infection, systemic inflammation, or trauma;
• Secondary prevention measures should be based on global risk assessment and
not depend on CRP;
• Serial measurements of CRP should not be used to monitor treatment;
• The average of CRP results repeated optimally two weeks apart should be
used in performing risk assessment, on metabolically stable patients.

L. Test Principle:
Human CRP antigens in the sample bind to the specific anti-CRP antibody absorbed
onto latex particles, and agglutination occurs. This agglutination is detected as an
absorbance change when read between 550-580 nm on an automated chemistry
analyzer. The magnitude of the change in absorbance is proportional to the quantity
of CRP in the sample. The actual concentration is then determined by interpolation
from a calibration curve prepared from kit calibrators of known concentration.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was determined by serial dilution of the Wide Range CRP Calibrator
with normal saline on AEROSET, according to NCCLS EP6-A protocols.
12 dilutions were performed starting from 480 mg/L down to 3 mg/L. The
dilutions were the following: 100%, 80%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%,
5%, 2.5%, 1.25%, 0.625%. Five replicates of each dilution were tested on
AEROSET using the three methods. Average value of each dilution was
calculated. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria used for each testing point
(level) was 100% recovery ± 10% (90 – 110%), calculated as percentage of
average found/expected. Also, linear regression was performed using the
expected value as the independent variable (x) and mean observed values as
the dependent variable (y). Slope, intercept (with 95% Confidence Interval),
and Pearson (r2) were calculated through the range accepted by recovery. The
sponsor’s acceptance criteria for linear regression were: slope= 0.95 to 1.05,
Pearson (r) ≥ 0.9800.
Acceptable linearity was demonstrated as ≥160 mg/L for the High Sensitivity
method, ≥ 320 mg/L for the Standard method, and ≥480 mg/L for the Wide
Range method.
High Sensitivity Method:
Dilutions were deemed acceptable up to 192 mg/L. Linear regression was
calculated from 3 to 192 mg/L. Linearity found for this method is from 3 to
5

179 mg/L. The sponsor claims up to 160 mg/L.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Subject of k030546 and k011169 clearance
d. Detection limit:
The limit of quantitation for the CRP Vario assay on the AEROSET System is
0.1 mg/L for the High Sensitivity method, 0.2 mg/L for the Standard method
and 0.2 mg/L for the Wide Range Method. This was determined by testing 6
levels of material (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, ad 0.5 mg/L) in replicates of 10 on
the AEROSET. The limit of quantitation was defined as the lowest
concentration of analyte with imprecision equal to 20 % CV.
e. Analytical specificity:
The CRP Vario test is not affected by the presence of Rheumatoid Factor up
to 550 IU/mL, conjugated and fetal bilirubin up to 30 mg/dL, hemoglobin up
to 0.5 g/dL, and lipemia (< 5% intra-lipid approximating 1500 mg/dL of
triglycerides).
