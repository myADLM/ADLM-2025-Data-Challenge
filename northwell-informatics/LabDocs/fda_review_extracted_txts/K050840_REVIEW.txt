510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
K050840
B. Purpose for Submission:
BioView, LTD is modifying the indications for use of the Duet™ system to include
the detection and enumeration of urine specimen cells from subjects with transitional
cell carcinoma of the bladder, probed by the Vysis UroVysion™ Bladder Cancer
Recurrence Kit.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
BioView LTD., Duet™ System
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Detection and enumeration of urine specimen cells from subjects with transitional cell
carcinoma of the bladder, probed by the Vysis Uro Vysion™ Bladder Cancer
Recurrence Kit which has been cleared by the FDA.
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Duet System is a fully integrated imaging and scanning platform designed to
enable identification and examination of cells of interest using a special dual-scan
process. Cytological analysis experts can scan any slide, using both bright field
and fluorescent illumination. While each type of scanning can be run by the Duet
system independently, Duet has the ability to run both types of scans on the same
slide, without losing the important data from either of the scans. Captured images
from the first scan are saved as a “historical record” and can then be used for
comparison during the second scanning stage. The images can be displayed side-
by-side in a gallery of captured snapshots, referred to as targets.
2. Principles of Operation:
The Duet System is software controlled and includes features such as: acquisition
of images, views, editing, relocation, enhancement capabilities, automatic/manual
counting and classification, printing, export of images and backups. The Duet
System can also scan each field of view with several fluorescent filters instead of
only one, generating and displaying a combined image for each field of view.

--- Page 2 ---
3. Modes of Operation:
a. Automatic scanning provides a gallery of targets that the system
captures for all identified fields.
b. Manual scanning provides interactive control over the microscope.
This enables a user-controlled scan of any slide under either bright
field or fluorescent illumination.
4. Specimen Identification:
Individual specimen slide case details are entered in a Slide Configuration dialog
box where case details and a name are assigned to a slide. The scan process
(fluorescent or brightfield), mode of scanning (automatic or interactive), scan
task, and scan program (coordinates) details are entered.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Standardized cell preparations on peripheral blood, bone marrow, amniotic fluid,
and urine specimens, are applied to microscope slides.
6. Calibration:
Calibration is recommended at least once every 6 months by Bio View service
personnel.

G. Intended Use:
1. Indication(s) for Use:
The Duet System is an automated scanning microscope and image analysis
system. It is intended for in-vitro diagnostic use as an aiding tool to the
pathologist in the detection, classification and counting of cells of interest based
on color, intensity, size, pattern, and shape. The Duet System is intended to detect
the following cell types: 1. Hematopoietic cells stained by Giemsa stain,
Immunohistochemistry or ISH (with bright field and fluorescent) prepared from
cell suspension; 2. Amniotic cells stained by FISH (using direct labeled DNA
probes for chromosomes X, Y, 13, 18, and 21); 3. Cells in urine specimens,
stained by FISH (using the Vysis Uro Vysion™ Bladder Cancer Recurrence Kit
for chromosomes 3, 7,17, and loss of the 9p21 locus) from subjects with
transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was determined using four slides, with each slide analyzed on
three different systems and three times on one of these systems. The slides were
selected to cover the range of the intended use, to include two negative slides, one
positive slide, and one near the medical decision cutoff. Two operators performed
the study at BioView Lab, in cooperation with Meir Hospital, Kafar Saba, Israel.
System reproducibility, measured by its consistency, was demonstrated by
calculating the percentage of agreement between measurements. A high, value
indicates a small variance between different runs on the same machine, relative to
the differences between machines. The calculated results of the variance within
the measurements using the same Duet System showed 100% agreement (12 out
of 12), with 97.1% (11 out of 12) agreement between systems. The overall
agreement level was 95.0%.
