quantitative determination of antimicrobial susceptibility by minimal inhibitory
concentration (MIC) of gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria

--- Page 2 ---
belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae and non – Enterobacteriaceae and
most gram-positive bacteria isolates from pure culture belonging to the genera
Staphylococcus, Enterococcus and Streptococcus.
The BD Phoenix™ SMIC/ID and SMIC Panel is intended for the in vitro rapid
identification (ID) and quantitative determination of antimicrobial susceptibility
by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of most bacteria isolates from pure
culture belonging to the genera Streptococcus.
2. Indication(s) for use:
This submission is for the addition of the antibiotic trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole at concentrations of 0.0625/1.2 – 16/304 μg/mL for testing
Streptococcus pneumoniae.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
The use of Columbia Agar with 5% Horse Blood may produce significantly
higher MIC for SXT with Streptococcus species, which may result in false
resistance. Therefore, antimicrobial susceptibility test results should not be
reported for SXT and Streptococcus species when Columbia Agar with 5% Horse
blood is used as the primary media. Antimicrobial susceptibility test results
should be confirmed using Trypticase Soy Agar with 5% Sheep Blood.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST-S
Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and
equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™
Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST-S broth, which contains an
AST- S indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST-S broth is a non-blood, cation-
adjusted broth containing purified water, Tween 80, pancreatic digest of casein, peptones
and other additional supplements for optimization of streptococcal growth. After adding
the indicator solution to the AST- S inoculum, the color is blue, and after inoculation and
incubation, it changes to pink then colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds.
Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated
Microbiology System instrument where the panels are continuously incubated at 35°C.
The resulting AST has a final inoculum of 5 x 105 CFU/ml. The instrument incubates,
reads and records the results of the biochemical substrates and antimicrobial agents and
interprets the reactions to give an ID of the isolate and MIC value and category
interpretation of the antimicrobial agents. Organisms growing in the presence of a given
2

antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator, signaling organism growth and resistance to the
antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or inhibited by a given antimicrobic do not cause
reduction of the indicator and therefore do not produce a color change. Additional
interpretation is done using software driven “EXPERT” System using rules derived from
the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI).
Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an ID result available between 2-12 hours and
an AST result available between 4-16 hours. This is only an autoread result; there are no
manual readings possible.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S15) “Methods for
Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard.”
L. Test Principle:
The system employs conventional, colorimetric, fluorogenic and chromogenic
substrates to identify the genus and species of the isolate. The AST portion of the BD
Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth based microdilution method
that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance detection
of organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells
containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control
wells” which contains no antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Thirty two isolates were evaluated for site to site and inter site reproducibility
demonstrating >95% reproducibility. The ten isolate study described in the
guidance document was used (10 organisms tested 3 times on 3 days at 3
sites).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The FDA and CLSI recommended QC isolate, S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619
was tested on every test occasion with the reference method and the BD
Phoenix™. The reference method QC results were in range for every day
tested. The BD Phoenix™ was tested a sufficient number of times to
demonstrate that the system can produce QC results in the FDA and CLSI
recommended ranges most of the time. The modes of the BD Phoenix™ and
reference method were different where the mode of the reference method™
was one well dilution higher than the BD Phoenix™ but still in the acceptable
range.

EA-Essential Agreement maj-major discrepancies

R-resistant isolates min- minor discrepancies
Essential agreement (EA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panels agree with the
reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference
method. Category agreement (CA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panel result
interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation.
Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the BD Phoenix™ and
the reference and have on-scale EA.
There appears to be a slight trend where the reference device was more resistant
than the test device as observed in both the accuracy studies and QC but still within
essential agreement.
