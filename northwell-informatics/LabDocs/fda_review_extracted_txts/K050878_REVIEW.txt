H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Refer to Indications for use
2. Indication(s) for use:
The On-Call™ Multi-Drug Home Test Cup is a screening test for the rapid
detection of drugs in urine at a designated cut-off concentration of 50 ng/mL
for Marijuana, 300 ng/mL for Cocaine, 1,000 ng/mL for Amphetamine, 1,000
ng/mL for Methamphetamine, 500 ng/mL for Ecstasy, 2,000 ng/mL for
Opiates, and 25 ng/mL for phencyclidine. The test is intended for over-
counter (OTC) consumer use.
This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific
alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional
judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when
preliminary positive results are indicated.
3. Special condition for use statement(s):
This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific
alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional
judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when
preliminary positive results are indicated.
The test is intended for over-the-counter (OTC) consumer use.
The materials necessary for confirmation testing are provided with the
screening device. Materials, as well as confirmation testing are provided to
the consumer at no additional charge.
Tests for opiates cannot distinguish between abused drugs and certain
prescribed medications.
Certain foods or medications may interfere with tests for amphetamines and
opiates and cause false positive results.
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Not applicable. The device is a visually read single-use device.

--- Page 3 ---
Page 3 of 10
I. Device Description:
The product is a single-use device utilizing a cup format. Test strips are
incorporated into the sides of a sample cup.
After urine is added to the test cup, operators replace the cup lid. The operator
then inserts a Key into the opening on the side of the cup as far as it will go.
This will allow the urine to pass into the test chamber to begin the test. The
operator will then peel off the privacy label to view the results. The results are
read at 5 minutes. Results are not to be read after 10 minutes.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
The test card assembled with the On-Call™ Multi-Drug Home Test Cup is
identical to the ACON Spectrum Multi-Drug Multi-Line Drug Screen Test
Card with Integrated E-Z Split Key Cup (K031759) in terms of product
design, performance characteristics, construction materials, manufacturing
process, and use. The On-Call™ Multi-Drug Home Test Cup is also similar to
the Pharmatech At Home™ Drug Cup for Amphetamine, Methamphetamine,
Ecstasy, Marijuana, Cocaine, and Opiates (K030447) as well as to other
commercially available drug screening test cups, which quantitatively
measure the presence or absence of target drugs and their metabolites by one-
step lateral flow immunoassay.
2. Predicate K number(s):
K031759
k030447
3. Comparison with predicate:
Both devices are for the qualitative determination of the same analytes in the
same matrix, and utilize the same cutoff concentration. Both are visually-read
single use devices.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
The sponsor referenced the same guidance document(s) from their previous
submission (k031759) since the test card assembled with the On-Call™ Multi-
Drug Home Test Cup is identical to the ACON Spectrum Multi-Drug Multi-
Line Drug Screen Test Card with Integrated E-Z Split Key Cup.
L. Test Principle:
The test employs lateral flow immunochromatographic technology.
Drug in the sample and drug-labeled conjugate (containing a chromagen)
compete for antibody binding sites in the test area of the test strip. Binding of
drug in the sample causes the absence of a line at the test area, i.e., a positive
result. When drug is not present in the sample, the drug-labeled conjugate binds

at the test line, resulting in formation of a line, i.e., a negative result. The
absence or presence of the line is determined visually by the operator.
The device also has an internal process control which indicates that an adequate
volume of sample has been added and that the immunochromatographic strip is
intact.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor indicated that the On-Call™ Multi-Drug Home Test
Cup is identical to the ACON Spectrum Multi-Drug Multi-Line Drug
Screen Test Card with integrated EZ Split Key Cup marketed under
510(k) K031759, and the ACON Spectrum Multi-Drug Multi-Line
Drug Screen Test Card with Integrated E-Z Split Key Cup a
modified device derived from two preciously cleared ACON devices
(k020313 and k023946). The performance characteristics concerning
sensitivity, accuracy, reproducibility, stability, precision, cut-off
concentration, and specificity apply to the ACON On-Call Multi-
Drug Home Test Cup.
The ACON Spectrum Multi-Drug Multi-Line Drug Screen Test Card
with Integrated Cup was marketed for in vitro diagnostic
professional use. ACON Laboratories conducted a clinical study
using the ACON Multi-Drug Multi-Line Screen Test Card with
Integrated cup at four (4) different sites, to include physicians’
offices and testing laboratory. This previous study demonstrated that
both professional and laboratory personnel could use the test to
obtain visual, qualitative results.
Consumer Study
The objective of the study was to evaluate the ability of lay users to
correctly follow test instructions, visualize the test line, and obtain
acceptable results. The studies were conducted at four (4) separate
geographical regions, with multiple sites in each region.
Six hundred nineteen (619) consumers participated in the study for
the On-Call™ Multi-Drug Home Test Cup. Consumers were
selected based on age, gender, and educational variation.
Sample Preparation
Fresh, drug free normal human urine was added to filtered urine and
drug standard solutions. Solutions were prepared for each of the

--- Page 6 ---
Page 6 of 10
studies by spiking the drug free urine with THC, COC, AMP,
mAMP, OPI, and PCP to the concentrations of 50% below
SAMHSA cut-off, 25% below cut-off, 25% above cut-off, 50%
above cut-off and 100% above cut-off. Solutions with out drug
added were also prepared (0% cut-off).
Concentrations of the prepared drug samples were quantitated by
GC/MS analysis by and independent SAMHSA certified facility. 40
mL aliquots were dispensed in vials according to the aliquot scheme,
and a minimum number of assays targeted for each solution were
determined.

c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
Device results were compared to GCMS.
d. Detection limit:
Sensitivity of this assay is characterized by validating performance
around the claimed cutoff concentration of the assay, including a
determination of the lowest concentration of drug that is capable of
producing a positive result. The On-Call™ Multi-Drug Home Test
Cup follows SAMHSA cutoff recommendations. This information
appears in the table below.
Cut-off Levels for the On-Call™ Multi-Drug Home Test Cup
THC Marijuana/ tetrahydrocannabinol 50 ng/mL
COC Cocaine 300 ng/m
mAMP Methamphetamine 1,000 ng/mL
OPI Opiates/morphine/heroin 2,000 ng/mL
PCP Phencyclidine 25 ng/mL
AMP Amphetamine 1,000 ng/mL
MDMA Ecstasy 500 ng/mL
e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity was established with the clearance of the
ACON Spectrum Multi-Drug Multi-Line Drug Screen Test Card
with integrated EZ Split Key Cup marketed under 510(k) K031759,
and the ACON Spectrum Multi-Drug Multi-Line Drug Screen Test
Card with Integrated E-Z Split Key Cup a modified device derived
from two preciously cleared ACON devices (k020313 and k023946).
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the
claimed cutoff concentration appears in the precision section, above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Because the candidate device was compared to a reference method,
GC/MS, it was not compared to a predicate device. According to the
sponsor, accuracy was determined by analyzing spiked samples
containing THC, COC, AMP, mAMP, MDMA, OPI, and PCP. See
consumer study above.
