fecal specimen is diluted with Diluent and Conjugate is added to the diluted sample. The
diluted sample-conjugate mixture is added to the Sample Well and the device is allowed
to incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes. During the incubation, any toxin A and
toxin B in the sample bind to anti-toxin antibody-peroxidase conjugate. The toxin-
antibody complexes migrate through a filter pad to a membrane where they are captured
by the immobilized anti-toxin antibodies in the line. The Reaction Window is
subsequently washed with Wash Buffer, and the test is developed with the addition of
Substrate. After a 10 minute incubation period, the “T” reaction is examined visually for
the appearance of a vertical blue line on the “T” side of the Reaction Window. A blue
line indicates a positive test. A positive “C” reaction, indicated by a vertical blue line on
the “C” side of the Reaction Window, confirms that the test is working properly and the
results are valid.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the TOX A/B QUIK CHEKTM test was determined using
known positive (n=6) and negative (n=2) fecal specimens that were coded and masked.
Testing was performed at 3 laboratories, which tested the samples on 3 days. The
samples produced the expected results 100% of the time.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
N/A
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
N/A
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity was determined using serial two-fold dilutions of
highly purified toxins A and B. Toxins were purified using standard in-house
procedures. Six separate tests were conducted for each toxin and the test was
consistently positive at a concentration of 0.63 ng/ml for toxin A and 1.25
ng/ml for toxin B.

The TOX A/B QUIK CHEKTM test was compared with the tissue culture test at three
U.S. hospitals and in-house at TECHLAB®, Inc. Specimens included in the evaluation
were submitted to the clinical laboratory for routine testing. The tissue culture test was
done according to the in-house procedure. The table below shows a summary of the
clinical performance of the TOX A/B QUIK CHEKTM test. The test exhibited a
sensitivity and specificity of 90.2% and 99.7%, respectively. The predictive positive and
negative values were 98.6% and 97.9%, respectively, and the correlation was 98.0%.

Of the 2 tissue culture-negative/TOX A/B QUIK CHEKTM-positive samples, one was
negative in a commercial toxin A+B ELISA. Of the 15 specimens that were tissue
culture-positive/TOX A/B QUIK CHEKTM-negative, 12 were negative in commercial
toxin A+B ELISAs. There were nine specimens that were unreadable. Those specimens
were negative by PCR analysis for the genes of toxin A (tcdA) and toxin B (tcdB).
A total of 51 fecal specimens diluted in Cary Blair and 32 fecal specimens diluted in
TM
C&S Transport Media were tested in the TOX A/B QUIK CHEK test and the results
were compared to those obtained by routine testing. The test exhibited an agreement of
97.6% for the detection of C. difficile toxins in specimens prepared in Transport Media.

4. Clinical cut-off:
See limit of detection above Sec. M.1.d
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The reported incidence of C. difficile-associated disease in patients with antibiotic-
associated diarrhea is 10 to 20%. In the studies conducted with this device, the incidence
ranged from 10% to 22%. The prevalence of a positive TOX A/B QUIK CHEKTM test
will vary from location to location and hospitals may experience rates lower or higher
than those observed at the sites used in this evaluation. Clostridium difficile disease is
primarily a nosocomial disease of elderly patients, and hospitals that have higher
numbers of elderly patients may experience higher rates. It is important to consider any
test results in conjunction with clinical symptoms because some healthy adults and large
numbers of healthy infants (up to 50%) will be positive for C. difficile toxin.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
1. The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
a substantial equivalence decision.
