510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
ASSAY ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
K050928
B. Purpose for Submission:
To obtain clearance for Dade® Thrombin Reagent and Dade® Owren's Veronal Buffer
for use in the measurement of fibrinogen. Dade Behring is modifying the packaging
configuration of the Dade® Fibrinogen Determination kits so that the kit components
Dade® Thrombin Reagent and Dade® Owren’s Veronal Buffer may be sold
separately. No changes are being made to the operating principle or reagent
composition.
C. Measurand:
Fibrinogen
D. Type of Test:
Fibrinogen determination
E. Applicant:
Dade Behring, Inc.
F. Proprietary and Established Names:
Dade® Thrombin Reagent
G. Regulatory Information:
1. Regulation section:
21 CFR 864.7340
2. Classification:
Class II

3. Product code:
KQJ
4. Panel:
81 Hematology
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
For use in the quantitative determination of fibrinogen in plasma and to accelerate
coagulation of anticoagulated samples for immunohematology.
2. Indication(s) for use:
For use in the quantitative determination of fibrinogen in plasma and to accelerate
coagulation of anticoagulated samples for immunohematology.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
4. Special instrument requirements:
I. Device Description:
A quantitative assay for fibrinogen (Clauss method) is performed by measuring the
clotting time of dilute plasma when excess thrombin is added. The clotting time
obtained is then compared with that of a standardized fibrinogen preparation.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Dade® Fibrinogen Determination Reagents (pre-1976)
Dade® Thrombin Reagent
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
BK 860038

and buffers

and sold separately Buffer
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Not applicable
L. Test Principle:
The enzyme thrombin converts the soluble plasma protein fibrinogen into its
insoluble polymer fibrin. The clotting time for diluted plasma is inversely
proportional to the fibrinogen concentration of the plasma. By using this principle,
Clauss developed a simple procedure for determining fibrinogen based on measuring
the clotting time of diluted plasma after the addition of thrombin. The clotting time
obtained in this manner is then compared with that of a standardized fibrinogen
preparation.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The Dade® Thrombin Reagent assay was used to measure fibrinogen
concentrations ranging from 0.89 to 2.8 g/L in Control Plasma N (K045333),
Control Plasma P (K042209), low plasma pool (PPL), normal plasma pool
(PPN) and Dade Data Fi® abnormal fibrinogen control (aFCP) (K811069).
Eight determination per day over 5 days (n=40) were performed using a
Sysmex® CA-1500 analyzer. The following is a summary of precision data:

d. Detection limit:

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed to determine the effect of icterus, lipemia,
hemolysis, and heparin on the Dade® Thrombin Reagent assay. Normal and
abnormal plasma sample preparations were spiked with increasing
concentrations of each interferent. For each spiked level, the % recovery was
determined [%Recovery = (Test result / Baseline) x 100]. The acceptance
criterion was established as 0.25 g/L relative deviation from the base pool.

modified Dade® Thrombin Reagent assay by evaluating 80 plasma samples
with concentrations ranging from 0.50 to 8.6 g/L using reference curves
generated with two lots of Standard Human Plasma (SHP). Regression
analysis yielded the following results:
SHP lot # 502587 - r = 0.995 SHP lot # 502589 - r = 0.993
