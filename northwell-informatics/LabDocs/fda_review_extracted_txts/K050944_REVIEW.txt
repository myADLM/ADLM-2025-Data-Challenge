K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
M29-A2 and H3-A2 (NCCLS documents)
L. Test Principle:
TheK-ASSAY (cid:163) Ferritin (2) assay is a latex enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay.
When a sample containing ferritin is mixed with the reagent 2 which is a suspension
of latex particles sensitized with rabbit anti-human ferritin antibody, a clear
agglutination occurs. This agglutination is measured by turbidimetry and is detected as
an absorbance change, with the magnitude of the change being proportional to the
quantity of ferritin in the sample. The actual concentration of ferritin is then
determined by interpolation from a calibration curve prepared from calibrators of
known ferritin concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i. Precision:
Precision was performed on Hitachi 917 using three samples. The
samples were low, medium and high controls (Immuno Q sera II from
Denka Seiken, Japan). For calculating within-run precision, the samples
were assayed twenty one times on the same day. For calculating between-
day precision, samples were assayed in duplicate over twenty different
days. The precision study met the acceptance criteria for all three samples
which was < 7% CV.

ii. Lot to lot reproducibility:
Lot to lot reproducibility was performed using three different lots of
reagents. The samples were assayed in duplicate over twenty different
days. The acceptance criteria for 10-50 ng/mL and 51-1000 ng/mL are
%CV (cid:148) 15% and (cid:148) 10% respectively.

High Control 431.05 425.2 435.0 2.538 0.59
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed using serially diluted in-house controls made
from spiked serum pool (Denka Seiken, Japan) with ferritin in low, medium
and high range. The acceptance criteria for linearity is ± 10% of theoretical
value and R (cid:149)0.99
To calculate the ‘low range’ linearity, a sample with 98 ng/mL ferritin was
diluted down to zero. The theoretical measurements of the different levels of
dilutions were 88.2, 78.4, 68.6, 58.8, 49, 39.2, 29.4, 19.6, 9.8 and 0.0 ng/mL.
The regression equation for this measurement is y=0.9858x-0.0591 with an
R=0.9997.
To calculate the ‘medium range’ linearity, a sample with 630 ng/mL ferritin
was diluted down to zero. The theoretical measurements of the different levels
of dilutions were 567, 504, 441, 378, 315, 252, 189, 126, 63 and 0.0 ng/mL.
For this measurement, y=0.9888x + 3.1818 with an R=0.9998.
To calculate the ‘high range’ linearity, a sample with 1000 ng/mL ferritin was
diluted down to zero. The theoretical measurements of the different levels of
dilutions were 900, 800, 700, 600, 500, 400, 300, 200, 100 and 0.0 ng/mL.
For this measurement, y=0.9513x + 18.377 with an R=0.9993.
The linear assay range is from 2-1000 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The reference standard for Ferritin calibrator is the 1st WHO International
reference Preparation Human Ferritin, established in 1984 (BIBSC code
80/602).
Calibrator: Secondary calibrators (In-house master standards) are produced
from commercially available human ferritin prepared from human liver and
value assigned to the WHO reference standard. The secondary calibrators are
used to assign values to the product calibrators. The unopened calibrators are
stable for one year from the date of manufacturing and Opened reagents are

found to be stable for 2 months if tightly capped and stored at 2-10(cid:113)C. The
stability of the calibration curve is found to be at least 4 weeks.
d. Detection limit:
The lower limit of detection was determined by assaying the absorbance of
serial dilutions of diluted Ferritin Calibrator A (10 ng/mL Ferritin) with saline.
The lower detection limit is claimed as 2 ng/mL. This was found to be the
lowest level of ferritin that had an absorbance range (mean +2 standard
deviation (SD)) above the absorbance range (mean +2 SD) of saline. The 2
ng/mL sample has a within run precision (n=10) of CV = 2.9%. Using a
clinical acceptance criteria of CV (cid:148) 20% at the lower limit of detection, the 2
ng/mL lower limit of detection meets the clinical acceptance criteria.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was preformed by adding the interfering substances at
highest concentration to the base serum. These preparations were diluted
serially with saline. Ferritin was measured in these diluted samples and the
percent recovery calculated based on ferritin concentration of the serum
diluent. The acceptance criterion for the percent recovery is within ± 10% of
serum diluent. Based on the acceptance criterion, no significant interference
was found with hemoglobin up to 1040 mg/dL, bilirubin F up to 62 mg/dL,
bilirubin C up to 62 mg/dL, intra-fat (which contains 10% soybean oil) up to
3% and intra-lipid (which contains 10% soybean oil, different manufacturer)
up to 5%. No interference with rheumatoid factor (RF) up to 520 IU/mL.
f. Assay cut-off:
No assay cut off was provided.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The Method Comparison study was performed with 64 patient serum samples
on the new device and the predicate device, Roche Tina-Quant, both on
Roche/Hitachi 917 analyzer. The samples were obtained from clinical
laboratories by the manufacturer. The samples were from Asian patients. The
samples covered a range from 11.2 to 766.8 ng/mL. The required
specification was R value (cid:149) 0.95. Linear regression analysis showed a slope of
0.89 (95% CI: 0.872 to 0.907) and an intercept of -9.4 (95%CI: -15.846 to -
2.96). The correlation coefficient was 0.9969.
b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison was generated for serum, EDTA and sodium heparin, with
20 samples. The samples covered a range from 7.5 to 161 ng/mL. The
required specification was R value (cid:149) 0.99. Linear regression analysis (serum
vs. Na EDTA plasma) showed a slope of 0.989 and an intercept of 0.21 and
the correlation coefficient was 0.997. Linear regression analysis (serum vs.
Na heparin plasma) showed a slope of 1.0612 and an intercept of -0.5524 and
the correlation coefficient was 0.998.
