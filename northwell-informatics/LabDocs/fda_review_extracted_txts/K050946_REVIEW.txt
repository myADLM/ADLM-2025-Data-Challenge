For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST-S
Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and
equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™
Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST-S broth, which contains an
AST- S indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST-S broth is a non-blood, cation-
adjusted broth containing purified water, Tween 80, pancreatic digest of casein, peptones
and other additional supplements for optimization of streptococcal growth. After adding
the indicator solution to the AST- S inoculum, the color is blue, and after inoculation and
incubation, it changes to pink then colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds.
Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated
Microbiology System instrument where the panels are continuously incubated at 35°C.
The resulting AST has a final inoculum of 5 x 105 CFU/ml. The instrument incubates,
reads and records the results of the biochemical substrates and antimicrobial agents and
interprets the reactions to give an ID of the isolate and MIC value and category
interpretation of the antimicrobial agents. Organisms growing in the presence of a given
antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator, signaling organism growth and resistance to the
antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or inhibited by a given antimicrobic do not cause
reduction of the indicator and therefore do not produce a color change. Additional
interpretation is done using software driven “EXPERT” System using rules derived from
the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI).
Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an ID result available between 2-12 hours and
an AST result available between 4-16 hours. This is only an autoread result; there are no

manual readings possible.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S15) “Methods for
Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard.”
L. Test Principle:
The system employs conventional, colorimetric, fluorogenic and chromogenic
substrates to identify the genus and species of the isolate. The AST portion of the BD
Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth based microdilution method
that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance detection
of organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells
containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control
wells” which contains no antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Twenty four isolates were evaluated for site to site and inter site
reproducibility demonstrating >95% reproducibility. The ten isolate study
described in the guidance document was used (10 organisms tested 3 times on
3 days at 3 sites).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The FDA and CLSI recommended QC isolate, S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619
was tested on every test occasion with the reference method and the BD
Phoenix™. The reference method QC results were in range for every day
tested. The BD Phoenix™ was tested a sufficient number of times to
demonstrate that the system can produce QC results in the FDA and CLSI
recommended ranges most of the time. The BD Phoenix™ and reference
method had the same mode. Another QC organism S. pneumoniae 3951, was
also tested where the mode of the reference was one well dilution lower than
the BD Phoenix™ but still with in the expected range. However, only S.
pneumoniae ATCC 49619 will be recommended for use by the manufacturer.

Inoculum density control: The organism suspension density of the ID
broth was equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard using the BBL™
CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer which was verified each day of testing.
Internal data was used to demonstrate that the use of the BBL™
CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer would produce reproducible results.
Five different instruments were used. Five Streptococcal strains were
evaluated to demonstrate acceptable reproducibility performance.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The CLSI recommended broth dilution reference panel was prepared
according to the CLSI recommendation. Clinical testing was performed at
four sites. The broth reference panel was set up on MH supplemented with
2% to 5% lysed horse blood as recommended by CLSI. The testing included
both fresh clinical isolates and stock isolates along with a challenge set with
known results. Since Penicillin Intermediate/Resistant S. pneumoniae isolates
drive the call for the S. pneumoniae group, only Penicillin Sensitive S.
pneumoniae isolates were evaluated. The test device had a growth rate of
>95%. A comparison was provided to the reference method with the
following agreement.

Essential agreement (EA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panels agree with the
reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference
method. Category agreement (CA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panel result
interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation.
Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the BD Phoenix™ and
the reference and have on-scale EA.
Also tested but not included in the summary table above were 377 Penicillin
Intermediate/Resistant S. pneumoniae. There were 79 min errors that were all in
essential agreement and 1 maj error in this category but no vmj errors. The BD
Phoenix™ demonstrated that it can accurately detect resistance in this group.
There appears to be a trend where the reference device is slightly more resistant
than the test device as reflected in the Accuracy studies however results are still
within essential agreement.

Streptococcus spp. Other than Streptococcus pneumoniae <0.5(S)
The ability of the BD Phoenix™ system to detect resistance to meropenem in
Streptococcus spp. Other than Streptococcus pneumoniae is unknown because
resistant organisms were not available at the time of comparative testing. Strains
yielding MIC results suggestive of a “non-susceptible” category should be
submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The Interpretative criteria, QC isolates and the expected ranges are the same as
recommended by CLSI. All values will be included in the package insert.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
