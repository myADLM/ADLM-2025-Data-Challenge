--- Page 2 ---
In the test procedure, sample is added to the sample well with the aid of a transfer
pipette and sample is allowed to soak in. If hCG is present in the specimen, it will
react with the conjugate dye, which binds to the antibody on the membrane to
generate a colored line. The DXpress reader interprets the test result automatically by
comparing the intensity of the test line to the preset cutoff value.

3. Comparison with predicate:
StatusFirst™ hCG Serum/Urine Test vs. Icon 25 hCG test
Similarities:
1. Both assays measure hCG in urine or serum.
2. Both assays are in-vitro immunological assays using
immunochromatographic method.
3. Both assays give the result with the colored signal.
5. Both assays are qualitative test.
6. Both assays detect hCG at 25 mIU/mL in serum or urine.
Differences:
1. StatusFirst™ hCG Serum/Urine Test read the result by DXpress
reader, whereas Icon25 hCG read the result visually.
2. StatusFirst™ hCG Serum/Urine Test reads the result at 5 min for

membrane, and the reagents at the Control line and the conjugate-color
indicator are reactive. In addition, the clearing background in the Result
window, by providing a distinct readable result, may be considered an internal
negative procedural control.
d. Detection limit:
To evaluate the sensitivity of StatusFirst™ hCG Serum/Urine Test the
following experiment was performed.
The hCG (calibrated to the WHO 4th international standard) was spiked to the
pooled negative serum or urine and made several levels of concentration. At
each concentration the test was repeated 10 times with one lot of devices. Two
lots of devices were used for the experiment. Therefore total 20 replicates
were tested at each concentration.
The reader is tuned to read hCG levels below the cut-off, to detect hCG levels
above 5 mIU/mL and less than 25 mIU/mL however since the reader does not
identify 100% of hCG levels in this range the results are reported out as
Borderline and are considered indeterminate. The results are summarized
below (Table 1).
The results supported the sensitivity of 25 mIU/mL in both urine and serum.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 116 clinical samples (51 serum samples and 65 urine samples) were
collected and studied. Since the samples with hCG in near sensitivity level
was hard to find some samples were made by diluting clinical samples with
high hCG concentration with negative samples. These specimens were tested
with StatusFirst™ hCG Serum/Urine Test and predicate device, Icon® 25
hCG by Beckman Coulter, according to the package inserts. The summary of
the results is shown below tables (Table 3).

In serum sample testing, 6 samples showed discrepant results between the
StatusFirst test and the predicate device. All 6 of the discrepant samples
contained hCG but the amount of hCG present in these samples was less than
25mIU/mL. The predicate device gave positive results for these 6 discrepant
samples. The StatusFirst(TM) Serum/Urine test gave borderline results for 5
of the 6 discrepant samples and a negative result for 1 of the 6 discrepant
samples.
In urine sample testing, two samples gave discrepant results between the two
devices. These two samples contained hCG, but the amount of hCG present in
these samples was less than 25mIU/mL. The StatusFirst gave borderline
(indeterminate) results for these two samples, while the predicate device gave
1 positive and 1 negative result for these two samples.
All discrepant samples had less than 25 mIU/mL hCG. StatusFirst
Serum/Urine test gave correct results (borderline or negative) for all these
samples.

Preparation of Samples
The test samples were prepared by spiking hCG into the pooled negative
serum or urine. Each panel consisted of five negative (–) samples, five at 5
mIU/mL, five at 25 mIU/mL, and five at 100 mIU/mL hCG. The samples
were aliquoted for each test and numbered for the blind test.
Testing
The test protocol, data recording sheets, test devices, test samples, and a
reader were given to the operator of each site. The operator tested each sample
by following the test procedure.
Results
The results obtained at each site agreed 100% with expected results in both
serum and urine samples.

N. Instrument Name:
LifeSign DXpress™ reader
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The DXpress™ Reader is a multi-functional portable tabletop camera-based
instrument used to read results of in vitro immunodiagnostic assays manufactured
according to standards developed by LifeSign, LLC. The DXpress™ Reader uses
an LED light source to illuminate an inserted test device. The reader captures and
analyzes the reflected image. For quantitative tests, the reader converts the
intensity of the test result line into a concentration of analyte using a calibration
profile contained in a preprogrammed Data Chip provided with each lot of test
devices. For qualitative tests, the reader reports a qualitative positive or negative
result.
The barcode scanner enables rapid entry of information, including lot number,
expiration date, and operator and patient identification.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes ___X___ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Keypad alpha numeric or bar code
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Single sample
10

--- Page 11 ---
5. Calibration:
Calibration QC checks and calibrates the reader optical system using the reference
values in a 1-line Calibrator (included) to read test devices accurately. The
Calibration QC is required at preset daily intervals determined by the laboratory
supervisor. After the power-on and completion of the Self Check, the reader will
instruct when to perform a Calibration QC if more than 24 hours have elapsed
since the last calibration.
Calibration QC requires a 1-line Calibrator which is included with each DXpress.
The barcode contains the quality control parameters for the Calibrator.
After completion of the Calibration QC, the reader will print a hard copy of the
result and store it in memory.
6. Quality Control:
External QC follows the same procedure as Run Patient. The only difference is
that Run Patient requires a Patient ID, whereas External QC requires a Sample ID.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not
Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Software documentation conforms to documentation in FDA premarket guidance
and hazards identified and controlled for are similar to devices of the same type
demonstrating the device was developed using good software lifecycle practices.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
