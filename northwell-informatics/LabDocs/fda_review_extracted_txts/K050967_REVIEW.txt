K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None provided.
L. Test Principle:
Varelisa CTD screen test is an indirect non-competitive EIA. The microtiter plate
wells are coated with human recombinant and native purified nuclear antigens and
dsDNA. Antibodies specific for the nuclear antigens present in the patient sample
binds to these nuclear antigens. In the second step the conjugate binds to the complex
and converts the added substrate to form the colored solution. The amount of color
produced is proportional to the concentration of the respective antibodies in the
patient sample. Test result is expressed as ratio (OD patient sample/OD of cut off).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To determine reproducibility, variation was estimated within-run and
between-runs using 4 samples (negative, low positive, moderate and high
positive) with 8 replicates per run for 6 runs. Within one day one operator
carried out the analyses. The intra-assay variability and inter-assay variability
target values for positive samples (ratio 1.0-4.0) were <12% and <9%
respectively. No target value was specified for the negative samples. For all
samples tested, the specifications were met. Results are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
No information provided.
d. Detection limit:
The purpose of this study was to determine the detection limit. The ready-to-
use sample diluent was measured 80 times per run (2 runs per lot). Analytical
sensitivity was calculated as the mean of the optical density (OD) of the
sample diluent plus 3SD (expressed as ratios). The specification for detection
limit is <0.3. For the first run, the (mean OD + 3SD) = [0.02 +3(0.009)] =
0.047 and ratio 0.1 and for the second run, the (mean OD + 3SD) = [0.017 +
3(0.010)] = 0.046 and ratio 0.1. The results met the specifications.
e. Analytical specificity:
Diluted samples were spiked and tested to determine interference from 4
different concentrations each of Bilirubin F (4.6-18.5mg/dL), Bilirubin C (5.4-
21.6 mg/dL), Chyle (530-2120 units), Hemoglobin (116.8-467 mg/dL) and

rheumatoid factor (100-500 IU/mL). The target value for the deviation of the
value of the spiked sample with the interfering substance should be ± 20% of
the value of the sample spiked with a buffer blank. The results obtained were
within the specification. The above noted substances did not adversely affect
the results.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off is set to 1.0 based on the results of normal population study
(400 samples from Caucasian subjects), the reference sera and correlation
study. The specification was that the 95th percentile should lie below the ratio
1.0. Results are considered negative if the ratio <1.0, low positive if the ratio
is between 1.0 and 1.4, moderate to high positive if the ratio >1.4.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Substantial equivalence to the predicate was determined by testing 183 CTD
samples and 100 disease control samples. Equivocal results of predicate ANA
assay is considered as negative and CTD low and moderate positive as
positive. Analysis of agreement between the current and predicate assay is
shown below

b. Matrix comparison:
To demonstrate that serum and plasma (EDTA, heparin and citrate) samples
gave same results, four samples for the different anticoagulants were collected
from each of 10 blood donors and assayed in duplicates. The samples were
then spiked with 10 different ANA antibody positive samples. All spiked
samples were run in four replicates. The specification was set that the
difference between the serum and plasma results should be lower than ± 20 %
for positive samples. Negative samples should be negative. For EDTA and
citrate plasmas, the specifications were met. For heparin plasma, a significant
difference between serum and plasma was found. Heparin plasma samples are
not recommended for this assay and the limitation is stated in the package
insert.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Same as assay cut-off.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Expected value in the normal population was determined by measuring samples
from 400 healthy blood donors with equal numbers of both genders and equal
distribution in the defined age categories (<30 years to >60 years). The mean
ratio for the female cohort is higher than that of the male. The overall mean and
median ratios for both cohorts were 0.44 and 0.37 respectively. The mean ratio
and 2 SD was 1.08 and the 95th Percentile was 0.83.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
1. The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
a substantial equivalence decision.
