2. Indication(s) for use:
The Nano-Check AMI 3 IN 1 Test is a rapid immunoassay for the qualitative
determination of Cardiac Troponin I (cTnI), Creatine Kinase MB (CK-MB), and
Myoglobin in human serum and plasma specimens at cutoff concentrations of 0.5 ng/mL,
5.0 ng/mL, and 80 ng/mL, respectively, as an aid in the diagnosis of Acute Myocardial
Infarction (AMI).
The Nano-Check AMI 3 IN 1 Test is a qualitative assay, which can not monitor the rise
and fall of cTnI, CK-MB, and Myoglobin in single testing. Single testing is not
recommended for AMI monitoring. Test results should be interpreted by the physician in
conjunction with other laboratory test results and patient clinical findings.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The device is for in vitro diagnostic prescription use.
The sponsor has not evaluated this device in point-of-care settings, and they indicate the
product will not be marketed to point-of-care settings.
The test system utilizes heparinized plasma.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable. The device is a visually read single-use device.
I. Device Description:
The Nano-Check TM AMI 3 IN 1 Test is a one-step single-use lateral flow
immunochromatographic assay. It is a visually read in a plastic cassette housing. A
membrane strip inside the plastic housing contains immobilized antibodies for each test and
at the control line. A disposable sample dropper is provided.
No human source materials are present in the device.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
The sponsor did not reference any standards or guidance documents.
L. Test Principle:
The test is an immunochromatography assay for the qualitative determination of three cardiac
markers simultaneously in serum and heparinized plasma. The membrane strip contains
three test lines and one control line; immobilized monoclonal mouse antibody against CK-
MB, monoclonal mouse antibody against Myoglobin, streptavidin for biotinylated cTnI
antibody, and goat anti-mouse antibody for control line. A dye pad is placed at the end of the
membrane containing biotinylated cTnI antibody and gold colloidal particles coupled with
CK-MM, cTnI and Myoglobin antibodies. When a sample is applied into the sample well, the
cardiac makers present in the sample bind to the specific antibodies coupled with gold
particles. cTnI in a sample binds to both cTnI specific dye coupled antibody and biotinylated
antibody. The immune complexes move along the nitrocellulose membrane through the test
lines and bind to their corresponding capture antibodies immobilized on the test line.
Unbound immune complexes pass through the test line and are captured by goat anti mouse
antibody in the control line.
If the concentration of any of these three markers in the sample is above the cutoff level, red
bands appear at the corresponding test lines and the control line. If the concentration of the
markers in the sample is lower than the cutoff level, only the control line can be seen in the
test window. The control line is present to validate that an adequate volume of sample has

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Two Clinical sites and one in-house operator were provided with blindly labeled
serum samples. All operators had experience with in vitro device testing.
Samples were prepared by diluting patient serum samples with normal serum to
the desired concentrations. Normal human serum samples were also evaluated.
Each sample was tested using 5 devices at each testing site.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. The assay is intended for qualitative use.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The test kit has an internal control to ensure that an adequate volume of sample is
added. External Quality Controls are available from commercial sources.
Specific controls are not identified in the labeling.
The sponsor does not indicate any degree of traceability for the device. However,
the device is calibrated during the manufacturing process to working standards
prepared to known concentrations of the analytes.
d. Detection limit:
Performance around the claimed cutoff concentration of the assay is characterized
by the precision section, above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Potentially interfering endogenous substances were spiked into normal serums
and into serums containing either cTnI, CK-MB or Myoglobin at concentrations
approximately 1.5 times the cutoff concentration of the assay. The substances did
not interfere with the expected results, i.e., spiked and unspiked sample results
were the same.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
4. Clinical cut-off:
Clinical performance of this device at the chosen cutoff concentration is characterized in
the method comparison studies presented, above.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Results of the Nano-Check Cardiac 3 IN 1 Test are interpreted according to the
predetermined cutoff values of 0.5 ng/ml for cTnI, 5 ng/ml for CK-MB and 80 ng/ml for
Myoglobin. These cutoff levels were determined by comparison to the quantitative
Access assay system of Beckman Coulter, Access AccuTnI, Access CK-MB Assay and
Access Myoglobin Assay.
The cutoff values of the Nano-Check device were determined by comparison to the
Beckman Coulter quantitative assay, Access assays. Specimens containing cTnI, CK-
MB and Myoglobin, at the concentration of equal or above established cutoff levels will
give positive results using the Nano-Check test.
N. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
None
O. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
P. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
