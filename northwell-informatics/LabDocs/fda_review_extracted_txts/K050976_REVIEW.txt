laboratory aid in the determination of in vitro susceptibility to antimicrobial
agents.
3. Special condition for use statement(s):
Prescription Use only.
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Not applicable
I. Device Description:
Each VITEK® 2 test card contains 64 microwells. A control well, that contains only
microbiological culture medium is resident on all cards, with the remaining wells
containing premeasured amounts of a specific antibiotic combined with culture
medium. A suspension of organism is made in 0.45 % sterile saline from a pure
culture and standardized to a McFarland 0.5 standard using the DensiChek. The
VITEK® 2 automatically fills, seals and places the card into the incubator/reader. The
VITEK® 2 Compact has a manual filling and sealing operation. Each card is
manually transferred from the cassette to a card loader to a place into a slot on a
carousel where it remains throughout its incubation. The VITEK® 2 systems monitor
growth by optical scanning of each well in the card over a defined period of time (up
to 18 hours) of incubation at 35.5o C. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)
readings are performed every 15 minutes. At the completion of the incubation cycle,
a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category
result for each antibiotic contained on the card.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) M7 (M100-S15) “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
Optics systems use visible light to directly measure organism growth. These
transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant
growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure
organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through the well. An
interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for an early reading of results with
an option to incubate up to 18 hours if necessary. The VITEK® 2 Susceptibility Card
test is based on the microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration technique with
concentrations equivalent to standard method concentrations. Several parameters
based on the growth characteristics observed are used to provide appropriate input for
the MIC calculations. Discriminate analysis is used to develop the algorithm that
determines the susceptibility result for all antimicrobials on the VITEK® 2 systems.
The MIC result must be linked to an organism identification in order to determine a
category interpretation. A category interpretation will be reported.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Ten on-scale S. aureus isolates were tested in triplicate at each of
three sites for three days for an overall inter and intra site
reproducibility of >95%. This testing was performed using both the
manual dilution of the inoculum and also the automatic dilution
method.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the
auto-dilution and the manual method of diluting the organisms. This
included one recommended QC organism with the following results.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A comparison of the clinical data was performed to the broth
macrodilution as the reference method as described in the CLSI
M7. All of the test organisms that provided results did so in <16
hours. Testing was performed using the automatic dilution feature.
In the Clinical testing both oxacillin susceptible and oxacillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus were tested at three sites that
included both clinical and challenge isolates. A total of 405
clinical isolates were tested. Due to insufficient concentrations
tested, (< 5) a CA only can be determined. The data in the table
below reflects the testing performed using broth macrodilution as
the reference method for the evaluation criteria:
total CA %CA #R min maj vmj
Clinical 405 403 99.5 38 0 2 0
Challenge 75 75 100 4 0 0 0
Combined 480 478 99.6 42 0 0 0
CA-Category agreement min-minor discrepancies
vmj-very major discrepancies maj-major discrepancies
CA is when the interpretation of the VITEK ® 2 results agrees
exactly with the interpretation of the reference method. The CA is
acceptable when compared to the reference method as described in
the FDA guidance document, “Class II Special Controls Guidance
Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems;
Guidance for Industry and FDA”.
The challenge set of organisms was also tested at one site using the
manual and auto-dilution methods of inoculation with the following
performance that demonstrated that there was little or no difference
between the two inoculation methods. The table below contains the
data from the two dilution methods of testing Staphylococcus aureus
using broth macrodilution as the reference method:
