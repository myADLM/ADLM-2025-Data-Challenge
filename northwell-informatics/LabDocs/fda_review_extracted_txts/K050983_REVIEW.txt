c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
The IRMA TRUpoint™ Creatinine Control kit is composed of non-
biological creatine anhydrous, sucrose and dye.
The range and value assignment was based on ANSI ASQ Z1.4
standard and is dependant on lot size. For a lot size of 600, thirteen
were tested to determine the range mean. The derived mean and
range is fixed according to CAP/HCFA criteria of +/- 0.03 mg/dL or
+/-15%, whichever is greater. The assigned values are chosen to
span the expected medically relevant decision point (approximately
1.5 mg/dL) and to incorporate the upper region of the reportable
range (approximately 7.5 mg/dL).
Closed Container Stability
Closed container stability testing was conducted on 4 lots of each
control level. Each lot was stored at different temperatures 4, 10, 22
and 30 °C and analyzed at its 4 week shelf-life. The sponsor reports
significant shifts at un-refrigerated temperatures in the mean results.
The sponsor recommends refrigeration storage of 2-8 °C.
Open Container Stability
Open container stability testing was conducted on 3 lots of each
control level. Two lots were evaluated through 2 hours and one lot
through 3 days. No significant changes in mean or variability were
observed and support the sponsors’ claim of 1 hour open container
stability.
