and labeling. To operate the meter, the user presses the power button which turns
on the meter and displays the strip code number currently stored in memory. If
the code number matches the number on the vial of test strips, the user is
instructed to proceed with testing of control or whole blood samples. If the code
numbers do not match, the user is instructed to enter the “code mode” by pressing
the power button for two seconds, after which the code number will begin to
flash. The code number can be changed up or down by using a button on the side
of the meter. When the codes match, users are instructed to press and release the
power button, which saves the code number to memory.
To test control solutions, users are instructed to insert a test strip and apply a drop
of control solution to the side of the strip. After the result is displayed, it can be
marked so that it is not included with the whole blood readings. This must be
done before the strip is removed.
To test blood samples, users are instructed to collect enough blood so that the
confirmation window is filled before the meter begins to count down from 10 to
1. If insufficient sample is applied, the strip should be discarded and the test
repeated. Once a correct result is achieved, it can be marked as a “Meal”,
“Exercise”, or “Stress” result so that recalled results can be associated with these
conditions.
The lancet supplied with this device was previously cleared under k833344.

L. Test Principle:
The following reaction occurs when a blood sample is drawn into the slit of the test
strip by capillary action:
β-D-glucose + Fe(CN) 3- glucose dehydrogenase (enzyme) Glucono-δ-lactone + Fe(CN) 4-
6 6
potassium ferricyanide (mediator)
The Fe(CN) 4- produced is then oxidized, producing electrons and a measurable
6
current, which is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the original sample.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the device was demonstrated by analyzing eighteen samples
prepared in a whole blood matrix. The sponsor used three lots of strips on the
GlucoDr™ and compared the mean of 3 replicates per lot to a glucose
reference method. The eighteen samples ranged in concentration from a low
of approximately 20 mg/dL to a high of approximately 600 mg/dL.
Linear regression of the comparison data yielded the following relationships:
Lot 1 GlucoDr = 1.0096x - 3.715 mg/dL r2 = 0.9978
Lot 2 GlucoDr = 1.0061x - 5.196 mg/dL r2 = 0.9968
Lot 3 GlucoDr = 0.9989x - 3.953 mg/dL r2 = 0.9972
The reportable range of the GlucoDr meter is 20 – 600 mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Two levels of control material are provided for use with the test system and
are traceable to NIST and NBS standards. Values are assigned to the controls
by comparing to a glucose reference method. The shelf life and in use stability
were tested and verified.

d. Detection limit:
20 to 600 ng/dL (see linearity study above)
e. Analytical specificity:
The specificity of the device was assessed by preparing three venous whole
blood control samples at concentrations of 64, 143, and 249 mg/dL. Various
endogenous and exogenous compounds were then tested at the levels in the
table below:
Potential Interferent Low Concentration High Concentration
Bilirubin 0.2 mg/dL 4 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 5.0 mg/dL 500 mg/dL
Oleic Acid 0.4 mmol/L 1.4 mmol/L
Palmitic Acid 0.2 mmol/L 1.0 mmol/L
Triglycerides 190 mg/dL 300 mg/dL
Acetaminophen 2 mg/dL 6 mg/dL

Citric Acid 3.0 mg/dL 30 mg/dL
Albumin 5.0 g/dL 6.0 g/dL
Maltose 5.0 mg/dL 20 mg/dL
If the tested compound produced a change of less than ±10 mg/dL at glucose
concentrations less than 75 mg/dL or less than ±10% at glucose
concentrations greater than 75 mg/dL, this was considered no interference.
Two compounds showed slight interference in this experiment:
Glucose Concentration Interferent Concentration Bias

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor performed a consumer study that included paired whole blood
samples at three sites from a total of 115 patients. Glucose concentrations
ranged from 63 to 423 mg/dL. The consumers collected and analyzed their
own capillary blood sample from the fingertip. Within ten minutes, a
healthcare professional collected and analyzed a second fingertip sample. An
aliquot of the same sample was used for testing on a laboratory reference
analyzer. Linear regression of the data showed the following relationships:
Consumer results (GlucoDr) vs. laboratory analyzer
Slope = 0.9858 (95% confidence interval 0.9595 to 1.0121)
Y-intercept = 5.85 mg/dL (95% confidence interval 0.736 to 10.957)
Correlation Coefficient = 0.9899
Consumer results (GlucoDr) vs. Healthcare Professional (GlucoDr)
Slope = 0. 9866 (95% confidence interval 0.9690 to 1.0042)
Y-intercept = 1.03 mg/dL (95% confidence interval 0.969 to 1.004)
Correlation Coefficient = 0.9955
NOTE: The sponsor also supplemented their method comparison studies by
preparing 20 whole blood samples and comparing them on the GlucoDr and
the laboratory analyzer. This brought the total number of samples to 135,
ranging from a low of 25 mg/dL to a high of 586 mg/dL. The GlucoDr was
operated by healthcare professionals with the following results:
Healthcare Professional results (GlucoDr) vs. laboratory analyzer
Slope = 0. 9834 (95% confidence interval 0.9676 to 0.9993)
Y-intercept = 6.99 mg/dL (95% confidence interval 3.4 to 10.57)
Correlation Coefficient = 0.9956
The sponsor’s original consumer study was performed using labeling written
in Korean which was translated to English after the completion of the study.
A second, smaller consumer study was performed entirely in English to
demonstrate that the sponsor’s English labeling could be understood and the
device used appropriately by persons fluent in English. Thirty capillary whole
blood samples were compared with glucose concentrations ranging from 72 to
187 mg/dL. The consumers collected and analyzed their own capillary blood

sample from the fingertip. Within ten minutes, a healthcare professional
collected and analyzed a second fingertip sample. An aliquot of the same
sample was used for testing on a laboratory reference analyzer. Linear
regression of the data showed the following relationships:
Consumer results (GlucoDr) vs. laboratory analyzer
Slope = 1.069 (95% confidence interval 0.992 to 1.147)
Y-intercept = -6.88 mg/dL (95% confidence interval -14.55 to 0.199)
Correlation Coefficient = 0.9829
Healthcare Professional results (GlucoDr) vs. laboratory analyzer
Slope = 1.056 (95% confidence interval 0.981 to 1.13)
Y-intercept = -5.17 mg/dL (95% confidence interval -12.52 to 2.19)
Correlation Coefficient = 0.9839
Consumer results (GlucoDr) vs. Healthcare Professional results (GlucoDr)
Slope = 1.008 (95% confidence interval 0.968 to 1.049)
Y-intercept = -1.21 mg/dL (95% confidence interval -5.286 to 2.861)
Correlation Coefficient = 0.9946
b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor wishes to use both capillary and venous whole blood with their
device. Comparison of capillary whole blood vs. a laboratory reference
method was presented in 2.a above. To evaluate performance using venous
blood, 60 samples were collected by venipuncture and analyzed on the
GlucoDr. Aliquots of the same sample were analyzed with a reference
laboratory analyzer. Results were as follows:
Venous whole blood (GlucoDr) vs. laboratory analyzer
Slope = 0. 9911 (95% confidence interval 0.9580 to 1.0242)
Y-intercept = -2.5 mg/dL (95% confidence interval -8.22 to 3.21)
Correlation Coefficient = 0.9921

N. Instrument Name:
All Medicus Co. GlucoDr™ SuperSensor Blood Glucose Test Meter
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional
readings.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes X or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with venous whole blood or capillary whole
blood from the fingertip. For capillary whole blood, since the sample is applied
directly to the test strip there are no special handling or storage issues. For
venous whole blood, the sponsor recommends the use of EDTA or heparin as an
anticoagulant and has provided data demonstrating that either can be used with
the GlucoDr.

5. Calibration:
The user is instructed to check that the calibration code number displayed at
power-on matches the number on the test strip vial. If it is necessary to change
the number, the meter can be placed into “code mode” by pressing the power
button for two seconds. The new code number is then entered by using the up or
down buttons on the side of the meter. When the correct number is reached, it is
saved by pressing the power button. No further calibrations or adjustments are
required of the user until a new lot of test strips are opened.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor is providing a high and low glucose control solution with this device.
After obtaining a control reading, users are instructed to mark the result with an
“Attention icon” so that the result is not stored into memory. An acceptable
range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is
referred to the troubleshooting section of the User’s Manual if control results fall
outside these ranges.
