--- Page 2 ---
2. Indication(s) for use:
“The Opiate Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay
system to detect opiates in human saliva with a cutoff of 30 ng/mL when testing
oral fluid specimen collected with Salivette collector (manufactured by Sarstedt)
and diluted with 1 mL of buffer.
The calibrators and controls of the analyte Morphine are prepared with oral fluid
buffer so that it can be used to verify and validate the assay. The assay is intended
for use in the qualitative determination of methadone drugs. The assay is designed
for professional use with a number of automated clinical analyzers.
The Opiate Oral Fluid Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous enzyme
immunoassay system provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more
specific alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment
should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary
positive results are used.”
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription, professional use only in clinical chemistry laboratories; the assay
is not designated for use in point-of-care settings.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Roche Hitachi 717 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The device consists of two liquid reagents; an antibody/substrate reagent and an
enzyme/drug conjugate. The antibody/substrate reagent contains mouse monoclonal
anti-morphine antibody, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), NAD, stabilizers, and
preservative. The enzyme/drug conjugate contains morphine-labeled glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in buffer with preservatives. Calibrators (3
levels) and controls (2 levels) are based on oral fluid buffer with preservatives and
contain varying levels of morphine.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
LZI Opiate EIA
OraSure Opiates Intercept Micro-Plate EIA
Dade Behring Emit II Plus Opiate Assay
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
k020368
k981341
k011289

3. Comparison with predicate:
The device and the predicate devices share a similar intended use. The device
uses similar reagents and test principle as the LZI urine assay, and the device is
intended for the same matrix as the OraSure assay. The cutoff differs between the
assays.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced by the sponsor.
L. Test Principle:
Enzyme-labeled drug and drug present in the sample compete for limited monoclonal
mouse anti-morphine antibody binding sites. Binding of the enzyme-labeled drug
inhibits its reaction with the substrate, thereby influencing the rate of absorbance
change measured by the instrument. The rate of absorbance change is proportional to
the concentration of drug in the sample. Concentrations of controls and unknowns are
calculated from the standard curve. Results are read at 340 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The negative, cutoff, and high calibrators and two levels of controls were
assayed with the Hitachi 717 analyzer in replicates of 6, twice a day for 10
days. The within-run % CV ranged from 0.54 to 0.70% and the total precision
%CV ranged from 0.73 to 0.87%.
A recovery study showed that the assay correctly identified six spiked samples
at approximately 50% above the cutoff as positive and six spiked samples at
approximately 50% below the cutoff as negative.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. This is a qualitative assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
A commercially available standard solution is made into a secondary (lower
concentration) stock solution. The secondary stock solution is then spiked into
the calibrators and controls to the desired concentration. The concentrations
are confirmed by GC/MS.
Stability Studies:
Real time and accelerated studies meet the manufacture’s acceptance criteria
and support a claim of 18 months when the product is stored at 2-8 ºC
Stability of morphine in the Salivette collection device was determined by
taking a pool of negative oral fluid samples spiked at three different
concentrations and split into three hundred and thirty-three samples. On day
3

--- Page 4 ---
one, 10 samples were run to determine the baseline for comparison to
subsequent runs. Of the remaining one hundred samples for each
concentration half were stored at 2-8 ºC and the other half were stored frozen
at -20 ºC. The study was conducted over 22 days; samples were run on days 1,
2, 5, 8, 14 and 22. The results support the manufacturer’s claim that the
sample is stable for 22 days when stored at refrigerator 2-8 ºC or frozen at -20
ºC.
d. Detection limit:
See the Precision/Reproducibility section above for performance around the
stated cutoff concentration.
e. Analytical specificity:
Various morphine-related and -unrelated compounds were tested for cross-
reactivity with the assay. Test compounds were spiked into drug-free negative
oral fluid calibrator matrix and evaluated against the cutoff calibrator. The
following table lists the lowest concentration that gave a response equivalent
to that of the cutoff calibrator. Cross-reactivity was calculated by dividing the
concentration at which the compound yielded a positive result by the
designated cut-off concentration.

Potential interference caused by other substances or drugs was evaluated by
adding various concentrations of each drug to oral fluid calibrator matrix and
testing with the Opiate Oral Fluid Assay: all compounds below gave a
response less than the cutoff calibrator at the concentration specified.

the Salivette collection device, is 30 ng/mL. Characterization of how the
device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff concentration appears
in the detection limit section, above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:

compared to a Gas Chromatography/ Mass Spectrophotometer (GC/MS).
Results from the study are presented below. The table describes the agreement
between the device and the GC/MS.

contain codeine at a concentration that produces a result higher
than the cutoff calibrator.
% Agreement = 94.8%
