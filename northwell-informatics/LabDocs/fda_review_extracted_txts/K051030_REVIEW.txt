K051030
B. Purpose for Submission:
To obtain clearance for the Coag-A-Mate MTX® III Analyzer which uses a new
optical system (LED) coupled with software changes to incorporate measurement
capability at 570 nm.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
bioMerieux, Inc.
Coag-A-Mate MTX III® System
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Multi-purpose system for in vitro diagnostic coagulation studies capable of
performing clotting, chromogenic and immunoassays.
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Coag-A-Mate MTX® III (CAM-MTX) is a fully automated instrument
system which consists of the MTX III analyzer controlled by a personal computer
with a monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer and an optional handheld barcode
reader. The analyzer is equipped with three liquid containers: distilled water,
CAM-MTX Cleaning Solution and wastewater for automated probe rinsing.
The computer is loaded with a DOS Operating System, which runs application
specific software to control the analyzer, manage the assays to be performed and
provide the diagnostic results for a variety of assays.
The analyzer can operate in random access or batch mode. The instrument can be
interrupted to load emergency samples and single test methods can be combined
in panels. Results and calibration curves can be printed via an A4 printer. The
results are saved in the database.
2. Principles of Operation:
1

--- Page 2 ---
The Coag-A-Mate MTX® III uses a photo-optical detection principle. Clot based
and chromogenic assays can be run simultaneously in random access. The
measuring module consists of the measuring rotor and a photometer. The
photometer contains two channels and each channel consists of two LEDs (one
for each wavelength), 3 lenses, 405 nm and 570 nm filters and a photo-detector.
A light beam passes through the cuvette and is received by the photo-detector. As
soon as the starting reagent is added to the plasma the measuring time starts. Any
change in the light transmittance is detected and converted into an electrical signal
by the photo-detector. When the assay has been completed, the raw data (seconds
for coagulation and mE/sec extinction for chromogenic assays) are processed and
reported.
3. Modes of Operation:
Random access, batch mode from primary tubes or emergency testing
4. Specimen Identification:
Operator input or optional barcode reader
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimens should be colleted, handled and stored according to “Collection,
Transport and Processing of Blood Specimens for Coagulation Testing and
Performance of Coagulation Assays;” CLSI document H21-A2.
6. Calibration:
Test methods for which the raw data is converted into concentration/activity units
must be calibrated according to the assay procedure.
7. Quality Control:
External controls are indicated based on assays performed. Each laboratory
should establish normal ranges based on their patient population and meet
conformance with local, state, and federal regulations.
8. Software:
The software for the Coag-A-Mate MTX® III has been developed upon an
existing software package from previous applications, i.e., MTX & MTX II,
mostly by enhancing their existing functionality. The Coag-A-Mate MTX® III
software version (3.0.04) is designed by the external subcontractor, based on
functionality expressed in the software requirements specifications and system
design documents. The design also takes into account all potential hazards (as
2

--- Page 3 ---
identified in the hazard analysis report) and failure modes.
Switching on the computer automatically starts the CAM-MTX Software. The
software has a menu structure and can be controlled via the mouse or via the
keyboard. The software provides a graphical user interface. The computer is
loaded with a DOS Operating System which runs application specific software to
control the analyzer and manage the assays to be performed. The Coag-A-Mate
MTX® III firmware performs functions related to the instrument user interface,
instrument control, electro-mechanical control, error detection communication
interface and the system infrastructure.

Submission for Software Contained in Medical Devices, May 29, 1998
J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
Method comparison studies were performed as described in NCCLS
Document EP9-A2 to evaluate the performance characteristics of the included
assays. Samples from normal volunteers and clinically abnormal specimens
were analyzed over a period of 22 days on the Coag-A-Mate MTX III® system
and the Coag-A-Mate MTX II system. Normal and abnormal samples were
analyzed in duplicate within the same run. The samples tested covered the
assay reportable ranges of each assay to include those that were within or
outside the laboratory’s reference interval. Each method was proven to be
within control ranges before any unknown specimens were assayed.
In addition to performing Passing and Bablok regression, least-squares
regression parameter estimates and Pearson correlation coefficients were
performed. The correlation coefficient range for all assays is 0.902 – 0.996.
D-dimer - A method comparison study, as described by EP9-A, was
performed to determine the relationship between results obtained using
plasma from normal donors and clinically abnormal specimens for both the
MTX III and the reference instrument, the MDA 180. Test samples (183
pairs) were analyzed over a period of 22 days. Each plasma sample was
analyzed in duplicate by each instrument and tested within four hours of
collection.
Additional characterized DVT samples with traceability to identified DVT
patients were tests. Samples were a subset of stored samples from a previous
D-dimer study on the MDA analyzer.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were run in conjunction with method comparison studies.
Controls materials were prepared fresh each day for all analytes and were run
in duplicate twice per day for a period of 20 days. The same lots of control
materials were run within each site through the entire period of the precision
study. Different lots of control materials were used between sites. Precision
studies were performed to estimate within-run and total precision according to
guidelines provided in “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical
Chemistry Devices;” NCCLS Document EP5-A.
Precision of the assays on the Coag-A-Mate MTX III® system was obtained
by evaluating two levels of controls in duplicate (three levels for PT, PT/INR
and APTT), one normal and one abnormal for all other assays, twice daily on
the Coag-A-Mate MTX III® for 20 operating days for each assay. A reference
curve was generated, or a calibration was performed, at the start of the
precision study and was valid throughout the study for the assays tested.
Several of the original design requirements for precision were not met. The
requirements were taken from R&D documents; however this did not take into
account additional sources of variation not found in the R&D environment.
The sponsor proposed new precision requirements incorporating the
variability associated with the performance of complex assays in the clinical
setting. The new requirements were established to reflect the broader
precision criteria likely to be experienced by the customer.
Precision of PT, PT/INR & APTT:
Three levels of control (one normal and two abnormal) were used at three test
sites with the assays conducted as described above. Averaged results from
total and within-run precision studies for all study sites are as follows:

Precision of Factor VIII, X, Fibrinogen, Thrombin Time, AT III, and
Protein C and D-dimer:
Two levels of control (normal and abnormal) were tested at the three sites (~
40 runs per site) for these assays. Combined results from total and within-run
precision studies for factor VIII, X, fibrinogen, thrombin time, and for
chromogenic assays (antithrombin and protein C), and D-dimer are in the
tables below.
D-dimer – Precision of the D-dimer assay on the Coag-A-Mate MTX III® was
obtained by evaluating two levels of controls in duplicate, one normal and one
positive, twice daily for a minimum of 20 operating days. Precision studies
were run in conjunction with the method comparison studies.

D-dimer - Studies to evaluate linearity of the MDA D-dimer assay on the Coag-
A-Mate MTX III were performed at two sites on samples (multiple dilutions) with
known concentrations of D-dimer previously tested on the MDA analyzer to
cover the reportable range of the assay. The recovered value of the Coag-A-Mate
MTX III in terms of D-dimer concentration will be compared to a known value.
Testing was performed in quadruplicate on the Coag-A-Mate MTX III® as
referenced to EP6-A. The combined correlation coefficient for both sites was
97.85%.
d. Carryover:
A total of 61 “sandwich” testing scenarios were identified for random access
testing in the Application Validation Plan and Validation Protocol. Testing
was performed on suitable controls that were sensitive to carryover problems
for individual methods. Two replicates of controls for the “target” method
suspected of carryover were tested (1+3) and two replicates of the control for
the “source” method suspected of carryover was testing for sample 2.
The mean, SD, and CV was calculated for all duplicate measurements. For
the final test specimen, the difference between the first replicate and the mean
of the first specimen is determined. Results for the final tube must conform to
expected performance criteria (< 3 SD shift).
e. Interfering Substances:
Interference studies to characterize the effect of interfering substances on each
of the assays included on the Coag-A-Mate MTX III® system were performed
according to CLSI document EP7-A. The effects of interfering substances,
icterus and lipemia, were tested using clinical samples that contained known
interfering substances. The degree of interference substance present was
reported as slight, moderate, or marked. The results obtained from the Coag-
A-Mate MTX III® were compared to those generated with the Coag-A-Mate
MTX II system and for D-dimer studies the MDA system was used for
comparison.
When testing samples containing interference substances the Coag-A-Mate
MTX III® and the Coag-A-Mate MTX II showed a high positive correlation
(range 0.889 to 0.999).
When testing samples containing interference substances, the Coag-A-Mate
MTX III® and MDA systems showed a high positive correlation (range
0.951).
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:

--- Page 10 ---
Duplicate Precision
Duplicate precision was estimated by testing clinical specimens covering the
assay’s reportable range in duplicate on the Coag-A-Mate MTX III® at one site.
Normal Reference Intervals
Samples obtained from normal volunteers were tested on the Coag-A-Mate MTX
III® system at all three sites. The requirements document and the operator’s
manual state that each laboratory should establish its own normal reference range.
The normal reference ranges provided were included as guidance for laboratories.
D-Dimer – normal donor samples were run during the method comparison studies
to determine the reference range for D-Dimer on the MTX III® at all three sites.
Testing of normal donors extended over at least five days and the samples were
intermixed with other specimens being tested. The 95% reference interval was
estimated as described in CLSI C28-A. MDA D-dimer normal reference intervals
on the MTX III lie between the limit of detection and approximately 0.74 µg
FEU/ml. The 0.74 µg FEU/ml limit was determine by examining the results at
the 95th percentile of all results and taking all results below that point as valid for
the assay cut-off. Readings at or below the limit of detection are regarded as
being in the normal range.
The reportable range for each assay was determined based on the reportable range
of the predicate device, MTX II except D-dimer which is based on a calibrated
range (reference value).

Stability was validated for one MTX III using one lot of reagent. At site 3 only,
duplicate assays for two levels of controls at desired intervals (e.g., 0, 8, 24, 48,
72, 96, 168 h) were performed. Reagent was tested past the expected stability
claim with fresh controls prepared daily. Mean results for both levels of control
were graphed as a function of time. The point where control results shift outside
expected performance ranges was determined for each reagent. A summary table
of on-board stability was provided in the submission.
