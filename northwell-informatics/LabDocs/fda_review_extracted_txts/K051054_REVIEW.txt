L. Test Principle:
When previously diluted plasma samples are applied to the microwell plate, any Factor
IX in the sample will bind to the capture antibody coated on the microwell. Unbound
material is then washed away, and the detection antibody, is added to the wells and
incubated. The unbound detection antibody is washed away, and the TMB is added.
After another incubation, the reaction is stopped and read at 450 nm. The intensity of
the color produced is directly proportional to the concentration of Factor IX in the
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra- and Inter-assay precision was determined for 3 validation lots.
The two controls supplied with each validation lot were tested across
four plates from each lot (40 replicates per sample per plate). Intra-
assay precision was also accessed by testing 3 plasma samples at
different levels of Factor IX. 8 replicates of each sample were run
over 10 days, by 2 operators for an n = 20. Method 1 reported a
mean CV of 4.74% and Method 2 reported a mean CV of 4.70%.
Inter-assay intra-lot precision was determined by testing 8 replicates
of 3 plasma samples over 10 days, by 2 operators, for a n=20. %CV
were calculated according to NCCLS EP5-A. The mean inter-assay
intra lot CV was 4.88%.
Precision between lots was determined by testing 10 different in-
house controls on 3 Validation lots. The mean inter-assay inter-lot
for Factor IX is 2.81%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated by analyzing calibration curves prepared
from the Calibrator Plasma. Dilutions were tested in duplicated b 2
operators on 5 plates per operator in three validation lots. Each of
the 3 validation lots demonstrated good linearity (r2 ≥ 0.990).
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
The calibrator plasma is standardized against an internal secondary
standard that is traceable to the WHO International Standard for
Factor IX activity (99/826). Value assignment for each lot of

--- Page 4 ---
Page 4 of 6
calibrator plasma is determined by testing 21 vials at four dilutions
each by two operators and calculation the mean value of the
determinations.
Control A is a normal control prepared from a frozen pool of
citrated plasma from healthy donors. Control, B is an abnormal low
control prepared from a frozen pool of Factor IX deficient plasma
and normal plasma with a known Factor IX level. The normal
plasma is added to the deficient plasma to bring the Factor IX value
to within the target range. The calibrator plasma is used to assign
values to the control plasma. Ranges are assigned to the control
plasmas by testing 21 vials of each at 2 dilutions by 2 operators and
calculating the mean ± 2 stand deviations.
d. Detection limit:
2 different methods were used to determine the lower limit of the
detection range. In method 1- the calibrator plasma was serially
diluted 1/100 to 1/51200 ( ( point curve). The lower limit of
detection was determined to be the lowest amount of Factor IX that
could be distinguished from the blank by a difference of 3 std dev.
With method 2, 3 samples containing ~0.005 IU/mL Factor IX were
prepared by mixing normal plasma with a known Factor IX activity
level with Factor IX deficient plasma . % replicated per sample was
analyzed. The limit of detection was calculated according to NCCLS
EP-17-P.
Results from both methods indicate that the lower limit of detection
is 0.005 IU/mL.
The upper limit of detection would be two times the value of the
calibrator in the kit.
e. Analytical specificity:
Assay interference was determined by determining the effect of
acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, ethanol, ibuprofen,
nicotine, ε-aminocaproic acid, bilirubin, L-ascorbic acid,
bicarbonate, hemoglobin, lipemia, albumin, heparin, and thymol, on
the recovery of Factor IX in samples containing Factor IX. The
testing was conducted according to NCCLS EP7-P. Results
demonstrated no reproducible interference. Results demonstrated
that high amounts of heterophilic antibodies such as lupus
anticoagulant or rheumatoid factor cannot be excluded, and is
indicated in the labeling.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A 3 site (One internal, two external) clinical study was performed.
Samples used were commercially purchased and previously assayed
by an independent activity assay. All samples were run in duplicate
according to the product insert instructions for each kit. At the
internal site each sample was tested in duplicate on 3 validation lots
of the VisuLize™ Factor IX Antigen and in the predicate.
