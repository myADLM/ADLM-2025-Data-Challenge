.
I. Device Description:
This complete device consists of the Bio-Rad VARIANTTM nbs Sickle Cell Program
(VnbsSCP) reagent kit, the Bio-Rad VARIANTTM nbs Newborn Screening System
(VNBSS) instrument, and the Bio-Rad Genetic Data Management Software (GDM).
The VNBSS instrument consists of a VARIANTnbs Neonatal Auto Sampler (VNAS)
module for microwell plates and a VARIANTnbs Neonatal Chromatography Station
(VNCS) module containing the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
hardware. The VnbsSCP reagent kit includes a specific analytical HPLC cartridge
containing cation exchange resin, as well as two (2) buffer reagents for establishing an
HPLC gradient. The GDM software is designed to execute the VnbsSCP assay
protocol on the VNBSS instrument using the VnbsSCP reagent kit components for the
purposes of qualitatively screening for the presence of normal hemoglobins F and A, as
well as the abnormal hemoglobins S, D, C and E from neonatal heel stick blood, as
collected on filter paper that is punched and eluted with deionized water. The VNBSS
processes each sample individually. An eluted sample is aspirated directly from a
microwell plate in the VNAS module with the punched filter paper disc still present,
and transferred into the sample loop in the VNCS module. The contents of the
sample loop are subsequently injected into the flow path of the VNCS module. The
hemoglobins of interest are retained on the analytical cartridge in the presence of
Elution Buffer 1. The ionic strength is subsequently raised by adding increasing
amounts of Elution Buffer 2. The pre-programmed gradient is designed to have the
hemoglobins of interest elute from the cartridge with retention times that fall within
pre-determined windows characteristic of known normal and abnormal hemoglobins.
The eluted hemoglobins are sequentially detected with a dual-wavelength filter
photometer, which monitors hemoglobin absorbance at 415 nm and corrects for any
gradient induced absorbance changes at 690 nm. The software processed HPLC data
is outputted in a printed report that contains: 1) sample identification, 2) date and time
of analysis, 3) a table of peaks that includes: observed peak identification
(hemoglobin type) name(s), retention time(s), peak height(s), peak area(s), and
relative area percent(s), 4) total chromatogram area, 5) complete chromatographic
display and 6) any error message(s) relating (if needed) to such data. Also reported is
an optional “pattern assignment” for each hemoglobin based upon “pattern rules”
derived from diagnostic hemoglobin literature.

a.Precision/Reproducibility:
The Bio-Rad VARIANTTM Sickle Cell Program device was based on NCCLS
Protocol EP-05A (Vol. 19, No. 2 [1999]) and EP-05A2 (Vol. 24, No. 25 [2004]).
Two analytical runs were performed per day on 20 days for a total of 40 runs on each
of 3 separate systems. Each run included 4 replicates of two retention time positional
QC controls. Within-run precision and within-device precision (formerly total
precision) were determined. The reported predicate device retention time precision
protocol included the same two retention time positional QC controls. However, the
protocol did not strictly conform to NCCLS Protocol EP5-A2 guidelines, nor was
within laboratory (or within-device) precision reported, as this was strictly a qualitative
assay. The results of within run precision for both predicate and new devices was less
than 1% for Hemoglobins F, A, E, D, S and C, and are presented in the following tables:

c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
Not applicable
d.Detection limit:
The Bio-Rad VARIANTTM Sickle Cell Program new device peak area limit
of detection for hemoglobin variants (E, D, S and C) was determined using a
total of 102 sample measurements bracketing the 1% peak area limit of
detection for each variant, when the total chromatogram area was 1.5
million microvolt x second (= μvolts·sec). The reported predicate device
peak area limit of detection was 1%, when the total chromatogram area was
1.0 million μvolts·sec. The results re: peak area limit of detection for
hemoglobin variants (E, D, S and C) was 1% for both predicate and new
device, and is documented in the following table:
Variant Peak Area – Limit of Detection

2. Comparison studies:
a.Method comparison with predicate device:
Method correlation between predicate and -Rad VARIANT™nbs Sickle Cell
Program new device was evaluated using 1025 unknown samples prepared
from retrospective neonatal dried blood spot collection cards. Using a total
area range of 0.90–6.30 million μvolts·sec, there was 99.8% (1023/1025)
agreement between test and predicate devices for all sample hemoglobin
identifications. There was 100.0% (250/250) agreement between test and
predicate devices for identifying hemoglobin S (HbS) in those samples that
predicate device identified as containing HbS. In the two disagreements, the
new device identified all hemoglobins identified by the predicate as well as one
additional peak in each case. [See explanation below.] These results indicate
satisfactory correlation between the predicate and test devices. The results are
presented in the following tables

In one case of disagreement the predicate device reported FA with an “unknown” peak in the S window
while the test device reported FAS. Independent iso-electric focusing results identified FAS in support of
the test device results.

FA FAS
Predicate FA 591 1
Device FAS 0 247
In the other case of disagreement the predicate device reported FAD while the test device reported FADC
with a 2.6% peak area of HbC. Inspection of the test device chromatogram showed a low broad
background in the C window without a resolved peak suggesting baseline noise.
