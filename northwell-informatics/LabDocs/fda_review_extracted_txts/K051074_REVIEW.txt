4. Panel:
91, Toxicology
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The MAS Immunosuppressant Controls, consisting of Levels 1 through 3,
are in-vitro diagnostic devices intended for use as assayed quality control
material to monitor the precision of laboratory testing procedures for
cyclosporine, sirolimus and tacrolimus.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The MAS Immunosuppressant Controls are for professional use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
I. Device Description:
The MAS Immunosuppressant Controls are prepared from whole blood with
stabilizers added to increase stability. The MAS Immunosuppressant Controls
include three separate controls known as Level I, Level II, and Level III with
approximately 70, 200, 350 ng/mL of cyclosporine, 5.5, 10, and 15 ng/mL of
tacrolimus, and 5.5, 10 and 15 ng/mL of sirolimus.
Human source material from which this product has been derived has been
tested at the donor level for the Human Immunodeficient Virus (HIV1, HIV2)
antibody, Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HbsAg) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)
and found to be non-reactive. FDA approved methods have been used to
conduct these tests.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Bio-Rad Lyphochek Whole Blood Control
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods)
Target values are set to create three distinct levels, which are obtained
by spiking each level to different analyte concentrations. Target values
take clinical needs, assay range, imprecision profile and CEDIA
specifications into account. Control targets are traceable to
gravimetrically prepared primary reference standards and are
confirmed by LC-MS/MS.
The MAS Immunosuppressant Controls open vial stability was
established by thawing each control level and testing the controls on
day 0 and day 14 using the CEDIA Cyclosporine Plus, Sirolimus and
Tacrolimus assays. The thawed controls were stored at 2 - 80C
between days 0 and 14; Controls tested on day 14 recover within the
established range of the respective CEDIA immunoassay as compared
to day 0.
Real-time stability of the controls is established by periodically testing
samples to determine recovery. The mean of the LC-MS/MS result on
test recovery must fall within ± 2 SD of the LC-MS/MS initial value.
Real-time stability studies support a claim of 24 months when stored
as directed.
