L. Test Principle:
BUN: Urease specifically hydrolyzes urea to form ammonia and carbon dioxide. The
ammonia is used by the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) to reductively aminate α-
ketoglutarate(α-KG), with simultaneous oxidation of reduced nicotinamide-adenine
dinucleotide (NADH). The change in absorbance at 340 nm due to the disappearance of
NADH is directly proportional to the urea nitrogen concentration in the sample and is
measured using a bichromatic (340, 383 nm) rate technique.
Na+ K+ CL- methods use indirect V-LYTE™ Integrated Multisensor Technology (IMT).
There are four electrodes used to measure electrolytes on the Dimension® V-LYTE™
system. Three of these electrodes are ion selective for sodium, potassium and chloride. A
reference electrode is also incorporated in the multisensor. Diluted sample (1:10 with V-
LYTE™ Diluent) is positioned in the sensor and Na+, K+ or Cl- ions establish equilibrium
with the electrode surface. A potential is generated proportional to the logarithm of the
analyte activity in the sample. The electrical potential generated on a sample is compared to
the electrical potential generated on a standard solution, and the concentration of the desired
ions is calculated by use of the Nernst equation.
IgG: Proteins contained in human body fluids form immune complexes in an
immunochemical reaction with specific antibodies. These complexes scatter a beam of light
passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the
concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison
with a standard of known concentration.
Pheno: The phenobarbital method is based on a particle enhanced turbidimetric inhibition
immunoassay (PETINIA) technique. The phenobarbital method is a homogenous particle
enhanced turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay (PETINIA) technique which uses a latex
particle-phenobarbital reagent (PR) and phenobarbital-specific monoclonal antibody (Ab).
Phenobarbital present in the sample competes with the particles for the antibody, thereby
decreasing the rate of aggregation. Hence, the rate of aggregation is inversely proportional to
the concentration of phenobarbital in the sample. The rate of aggregation is measured using
bichromatic turbidimetric readings at 340 nm and 700 nm. The concentration is determined
by means of a mathematical function.
CKMB: The MMB method is a homogenous sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay
based on Luminescent Oxygen Channeling Immunoassay (LOCI™) technology. LOCI™
reagents include two latex bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-mass creatine kinase MB
isoenzyme monoclonal antibody fragment. The first bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with
streptavidin and contains photosensitive dye. The second bead reagent (Chemibeads) is
coated with a second anti-mass creatine kinase MB isoenzyme monoclonal antibody and
contains chemiluminescent dye. Sample is incubated with Chemibeads and biotinylated
antibody to form a bead - mass creatine kinase MB isoenzyme - biotinylated antibody
sandwich. Sensibeads are added and bind to the biotin to form bead-pair immunocomplexes.
Illumination of the complex by light at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads
which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting
signal is measured at 612 nm and is a direct function of the mass creatine kinase MB
isoenzyme concentration in the sample.

solution at target concentration. Stock solution recovered value vs. Master
Pool assigned values. Commercial Lot - Calculated quantities of stock
Solution added to drug free normal human serum to target concentrations for
two calibrator levels. The concentration of each level is within acceptable
ranges using a Vista instrument calibrated with Master Pools. A previously
released commercial lot is used as a control. Each level is tested on three Vista
instruments, N= 45 total replicates.
Shelf life
Study duration is the labeled product shelf life plus 6 days. 12 months shelf
life requires testing a minimum of 6 days past 12 months. Control Material
Identical lot of calibrator product stored at -20oC. Five replicates per level
Product is stored at 4oC throughout testing cycle and tested on days 0, 3, 7, 35,
98, 189, 280, 325, and 371. The control material is stored at -20oC and tested
at the same frequency.
Freeze – Thaw Testing
Product is frozen and thawed three times (3 cycles over three days) and then
stored at 4oC. Testing occurs on days 7, 35, 189 and 371.
Open and punctured vial
Vials are opened/punctured on day zero. A quantity sufficient for multiple
calibrations is removed and the vials are recapped and stored at 2-8oC. Open
vials are tested on Day 31 vs. freshly opened vials.
The reference material (control) is stored at -20oC. The method is calibrated
from this stored material. The 4oC material values are recovered vs. the
calibrations. Recoveries vs. time are monitored and drift determined.
Allowable drift is < 8%.
Vista MMB Calibrator
Human heart CKMB added to 6%, buffered and preserved, bovine
serum albumin. 6-levels liquid, stored at -70oC. Verification of Master Pool
recovered values vs. Master Pool assigned values. Commercial lot Stock

Solution Human heart CKMB added volumetrically to stock solution at target
concentration Verification - Stock solution recovered value vs. Master Pool
assigned values Commercial Lot - Calculated quantities of stock solution
added to calibrator base matrix to target concentrations for three calibrator
levels. Verify that the concentration of each level is within acceptable ranges
using a Vista instrument calibrated with Master Pools. Assign final bottle
values to each level of the Commercial Lot. A previously released
commercial lot is used as a control. Each level is tested on three Vista
instruments. N=45 total replicates.
Shelf life same as above, but Allowable drift is < 5%.
V-LYTE™ Standard Solutions (A&B) (NA+/K+/Cl-)
NIST certified NaCL & KCl is weighed into aqueous solutions with buffer
& preservative. Stored at 2-8 degrees C two levels (Std. A & Std. B)
Verification – Master Lot recovered values vs. Master Lot assigned values
using Atomic absorption analyzer. Commercial Lot - Reagent grade NaCL &
KCl weighed into aqueous solutions with buffer & preservative. Two levels
(Std. A & Std. B). Verify that the concentration of each level is within
acceptable ranges using a Flame Photometer and Cl titrator calibrated with
Master Lot solutions. 9 replicates each level Confirm measured concentrations
are within specification.
Shelf life same as above, but additional 30 Day Onboard Stability testing
where standards are installed on day zero. The V-LYTE™ system is
calibrated & 5 Replicates of 3 QC products are assayed. Onboard standards
are used for QC testing on Day 31 vs. freshly installed standards. Allowable
drift is < 1%.
d. Detection limit:
Except for electrolytes, detection limit is based on the analytical sensitivity
represents the lowest concentration of analyte that can be distinguished from
zero. This sensitivity is defined as the mean value (n=20 replicates) plus two
standard deviations of a zero level sample. Analytical sensitivity data is
included for applicable methods.
BUN = 1 mg/dL, IgG = 0.8 g/L, Pheno = 2.0 (cid:31)g/mL, CKMB = 0.5 ng/mL
Electrolyte detection limit is based on linearity studies.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed using guidance supplied by CLSI/NCCLS,
Document EP7-A, "Interference testing in Clinical Chemistry.” Potential
Interfering Substances section of product insert sheets for method specific
interfering substances summary information.
