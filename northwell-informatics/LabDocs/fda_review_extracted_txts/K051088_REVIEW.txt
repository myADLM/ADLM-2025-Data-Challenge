These calibrators and controls contain a known concentration of a mixture of specific
drug analytes. The Negative Calibrator is a processed, drug free urine matrix. The
Low, Cutoff, Intermediate and High Calibrators are prepared by spiking known
concentrations of drug analyte into the Negative Calibrator matrix. Control Level 1
and 2 are prepared by spiking known concentrations of drug analyte into the Negative
Calibrator matrix. The following concentrations of each drug analyte in their
corresponding calibrators and controls are summarized:

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): No Standard or
Guidance Document was referenced in this submission
L. Test Principle: N/A
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: N/A
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrators and controls are purchased from a supplier of analytical standards which
provides documented traceability to drug standards. The supplier provides a certificate of
analysis which includes the description of the material, reference material code and batch
number, the certified values, the level of homogeneity and the data generated by GC/MS
and HPLC. The concentrations of the calibrators and controls were confirmed with
GC/MS. In addition some of the calibrators and controls are compared to calibration
curves prepared from USP Reference Materials.
Stability
The calibrators and controls were split into two 15-mL vials with dropper tip and screw-
on cap. When not in use, these vials were always capped. One set of aliquots containing
the different levels of calibrators and controls were stored at 2-80 C while the other set of
aliquots were stored at room temperature, 22-250 C. The signals produced by the assays
were compared at day 1, day 143, day 189 and day 244. The data demonstrates that the
analytes are stable in the matrix; there is no significant difference in rate produced by the
two sets of calibrators/controls. Based on these studies, the stability is expected to be at
least 18 months. The sponsor specifies the concentrations of materials evaluated in the
studies, the frequency of testing, the method for testing the materials, and the
environmental conditions of storage. Accelerated studies are being used by the sponsor
to estimate the expiration date; however, on-going real time studies are being performed.

Expected Values
The Negative Calibrator is a processed, drug free urine matrix. The Low, Cutoff,
Intermediate and High Calibrators are prepared by spiking known concentrations of drug
analyte into the Negative Calibrator matrix. Control Level 1 and 2 are prepared by
spiking known concentrations of drug analyte into the Negative Calibrator matrix. The
concentrations are confirmed by GC/MS. Refer to section I for drug concentrations in the
calibrators/controls.
