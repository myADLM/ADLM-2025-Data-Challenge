determination of lactate dehydrogenase activity in heparinized plasma or
serum in a clinical laboratory setting or point-of-care location.
Lactate dehydrogenase measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment
of liver diseases such as acute viral hepatitis and cirrhosis; cardiac diseases
such as myocardial infarction; and tissue alterations of the heart, kidney, liver,
and muscle.

For prescription use only
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Piccolo Point-of-Care Chemistry Analyzer
I. Device Description:
According to the sponsor the Piccolo Chemotherapy Evaluation Panel Reagent Disc
which contains the Piccolo Lactate Dehydrogenase Test System is designed for
heparinized plasma and serum use only. The disc meters the required quantity of
sample and diluent, mixes the sample with the diluent, and delivers the mixture to the
reaction cuvettes along the disc perimeter. The diluted sample then mixes with the
reagent beads, initiating the chemical reactions that are then monitored by the
analyzer. The disc is an 8 cm. diameter single-use device. Upon completion of the
analysis, the disc, containing the diluted heparinized plasma or serum, is discarded.

L. Test Principle:
Reagents are formed into lyophilized microspheres and placed in reaction cuvettes
along the periphery of the reagent disc. In the first step, L-Lactate and Nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is oxidized to pyruvate and nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NADH) by lactate dehydrogenase. The resulting NADH is then used to
reduce p-Iodo Nitrotetrazolium Violet (INT) to formazan through the catalysis of
diaphorase. The highly colored formazan is measured at 500 nm and 630 nm bi
chromatically and is directly proportional to the lactate dehydrogenase activity of the
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
According to the sponsor, precision studies were conducted using 2
levels of a commercially available human serum-based control. The
controls were run in duplicate on the Chemotherapy Evaluation
Reagent Disc containing Lactate Dehydrogenase. The sponsor used a
total of 4 separate Piccolo Point-of-Care Chemistry Analyzers, 2 at
the clinical trial site and 2 at Abaxis. Each level of control was
assayed twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon
for 5 days for a total of 80 data points. A summary of the within-run
and total precision of Lactate Dehydrogenase (LD) assayed on the
Piccolo Point-of-care Chemistry Analyzer is shown in the table
below.
Lactate Dehydrogenase Within-Run Total Precision

%CV 3.4 5.0
Control Level 2
Mean 350.0 350.0
SD 3.8 7.0
%CV 1.1 2.0
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
According to the sponsor a human serum pool containing a low
concentration of LD (48 U/L) was spiked with LD to a concentration
of 1,143 U/L. Dilutions of this high LD sample were made into the
low LD serum pool according to NCCLS EP6-A.

Pools containing the 5 levels of LD were assayed in replicates of 4
on 4 Piccolo Point-of-Care Chemistry Analyzers. Four analyzers
were used to ensure that recoveries were not instrument-specific.
The results for Lactate Dehydrogenase were plotted and the graphic
representation is summarized in the table below.

Summary of Linearity Results
Slope 1.012
Intercept +0.253
Corr. Coefficient 0.998
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
The sponsor calibrated the LD assay to match the LD assay with an
internationally used commercial assay.
Stability was determined by real-time stability at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15,
18 and 21 months at 2-8° C. Accelerated stability testing at 25° C at
0, 14, 21 and 28 days and at 35° C at 0, 3 and 10 days. The sponsor
recommends storage for the Lactate Dehydrogenase assay at 2-8° C
for 6 months after manufactured disc date.
d. Detection limit:
According to the sponsor the concentration of Lactate
Dehydrogenase that could be differentiated above 0 mg/dL by the
Piccolo Lactate Dehydrogenase Test system with 95% confidence
(twice the standard deviation was 8 U/L) Abaxis decided to take a
conservative approach and use 50 U/L as the lowest reportable LD
value.

Dynamic Range
Calibration of the Piccolo Lactate Dehydrogenase Test System makes use
of a calibrator above 1000 U/L (the current calibrator is 1,203 U/L). The
lowest calibrator has a value of 54 U/L). Based on the above sensitivity
studies the sponsor used 50 U/L as the lowest reportable LD value. The
dynamic range is indicated in below.

levels of potential interferents (endogenous and exogenous
substances), and a control pool containing LD were tested by
running 4 replicates on different Piccolo Point-of-Care Chemistry
analyzers. The difference in mean LD concentrations between each
test pool and the control pools was determined. The below chart
indicates how values are displayed when elevated hemoglobin values
are detected.
Hemoglobin values Displayed

Greater than 150 mg/dL No LD value and “HEM” will be

The “H” indicates influence from hemolysis. The sponsor used this
annotation to help the operator interpret LD activity in the presence
of small amounts of hemolysis. The endogenous interference limits
are noted in the below chart.
