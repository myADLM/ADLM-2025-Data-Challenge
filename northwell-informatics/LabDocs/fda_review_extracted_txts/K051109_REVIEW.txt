--- Page 2 ---
belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae and non – Enterobacteriaceae and
most gram-positive bacteria isolates from pure culture belonging to the genera
Staphylococcus, Enterococcus and Streptococcus.
The BD Phoenix™ SMIC/ID and SMIC Panel is intended for the in vitro rapid
identification (ID) and quantitative determination of antimicrobial susceptibility
by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of most bacteria isolates from pure
culture belonging to the genera Streptococcus.
2. Indication(s) for use:
This submission is for the addition of the antibiotic erythromycin at
concentrations of 0.0156 - 4 μg/mL for testing Streptococcus spp. only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
Results for Streptococcus viridans group have been excluded in the BD
Phoenix™ therefore no results will be reported. An alternate method should be
performed when these combinations are identified.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST-S
Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and
equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™
Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST-S broth, which contains an
AST- S indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST-S broth is a non-blood, cation-
adjusted broth containing purified water, Tween 80, pancreatic digest of casein, peptones
and other additional supplements for optimization of streptococcal growth. After adding
the indicator solution to the AST- S inoculum, the color is blue, and after inoculation and
incubation, it changes to pink then colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds.
Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated
Microbiology System instrument where the panels are continuously incubated at 35°C.
The resulting AST has a final inoculum of 5 x 105 CFU/ml. The instrument incubates,
reads and records the results of the biochemical substrates and antimicrobial agents and
interprets the reactions to give an ID of the isolate and MIC value and category
interpretation of the antimicrobial agents. Organisms growing in the presence of a given
antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator, signaling organism growth and resistance to the
antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or inhibited by a given antimicrobic do not cause
reduction of the indicator and therefore do not produce a color change. Additional
interpretation is done using software driven “EXPERT” System using rules derived from

the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI).
Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an ID result available between 2-12 hours and
an AST result available between 4-16 hours. This is only an autoread result; there are no
manual readings possible.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S15) “Methods for
Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard.”
L. Test Principle:
The system employs conventional, colorimetric, fluorogenic and chromogenic
substrates to identify the genus and species of the isolate. The AST portion of the BD
Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth based microdilution method
that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance detection
of organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells
containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control
wells” which contains no antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Twelve strains were evaluated for site to site and inter site reproducibility
demonstrating >95% reproducibility. The ten isolate study described in the
guidance document was used (10 organisms tested 3 times on 3 days at 3
sites).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The CLSI recommended QC isolate, S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 was tested
on every test occasion with the reference method and the BD Phoenix™. The
reference method QC results were in range for every day tested. The BD
Phoenix™ was tested a sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the
system can produce QC results in the CLSI recommended ranges most of the
time. The modes of the BD Phoenix™ and reference method were different
where the mode of the reference method was one well dilution higher than the
BD Phoenix™ but still in the acceptable range.

The CLSI recommended broth dilution reference panel was prepared
according to the CLSI recommendation. Clinical testing was performed at
four sites. The broth reference panel was set up on MH supplemented with
2% to 5% lysed horse blood as recommended by CLSI. The testing included
both fresh clinical isolates and stock isolates along with a challenge set with

EA-Essential Agreement maj-major discrepancies
CA-Category Agreement vmj-very major discrepancies
R-resistant isolates min- minor discrepancies
Essential agreement (EA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panels agree with the
reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference
method. Category agreement (CA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panel result
interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation.
Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the BD Phoenix™ and
the reference and have on-scale EA.
There appears to be a trend where the reference device is slightly more resistant
than the test device as reflected in the QC and Accuracy studies however results are
still within essential agreement.
