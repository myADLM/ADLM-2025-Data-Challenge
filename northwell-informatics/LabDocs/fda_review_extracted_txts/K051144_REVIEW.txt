resulting bound complexes of labeled ARAb and autoantibody are then
immunoprecipitated with anti-human IgG. After centrifugation, the supernatant is
aspirated and the pellet containing labeled ARAb/autoantibody-bound complex is
counted in a gamma counter for 1 min. Counts are directly proportional to the
amount of autoantibody present and results are expressed as the concentration of
alpha-bungarotoxin bound (nmoles/L toxin bound). A standard curve is generated to
calculate the values. All samples with a mean cpm above the cut off are considered
positive.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:

added to serum samples with various initial acetylcholine receptor antibody
concentrations. Each sample was assayed in duplicate in one run. % recovery
rates were calculated. Mean recovery was 106% ± 19% (range 87-153%).

d. Detection limit:
The lower detection limit is 0.01nmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity with autoantibodies potentially interfering with ARAb RRA
was assessed. Nine patient serum samples containing autoantibodies (anti-
Sm, -RNP, -RO (SSA), La (SS-B), -dsDNA,-RF, and ANA) were tested. No
cross reactivities were found with any of the antibodies. In addition,
hemoglobin (0.25 and 4 mg/mL), bilirubin (0.03 and 0.5 mg/mL and
triglycerides (0.2 to 30mg/mL) were evaluated for interference. All test

results are available in the submission. Results showed no significant
interference at the concentrations tested.
f. Assay cut-off:
One hundred and thirty serum and EDTA plasma samples from blood donors
were assayed. Range of values were between 0.013 and 0116 nmol/L for
serum and 0.013 and 0.086 nmol/L for plasma The upper limit of reference
range is at 0.110 nmol/L for serum and 0.081 nmol/L for plasma. Cut off is
set at 0.25 nmol/L. Antibody titers greater than 0.4 nmol/L are indicative of
Myasthenia Gravis (positive). Values between 0.25 and 0.4 nmol/L is
considered as equivocal
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Fifty-three patient samples consisted of 38 Myasthenia Gravis positive
samples and 15 Myasthenia Gravis negative samples were tested with the
Kronus RIA test and IBL RRA test. Equivocal results are considered positive.
Comparative results are summarized below:

IBL + 37 0 0 37
Equivocal 2 0 0 2
- 0 2 12 14
Total 39 2 12 53
% Positive agreement = 95.1% (39/41) (95% CI: 83.5% to 99.4%)
% Negative agreement = 100% (12/12) (95% CI: 73.5% to 100%)
% Total agreement = 96.2% (51/53)
b. Matrix comparison:
Seven patient samples, serum and EDTA plasma, comparison showed no
significant difference. A correlation coefficent of linear regression was r =
0.984. Regression line was calculated (plasma) =0.931 (serum) + 0.062.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical sensitivity and specificity:
The same samples used in the comparison study were also used determine the
clinical sensitivity and specificity of the IBL RRA and the Kronus RIA.
