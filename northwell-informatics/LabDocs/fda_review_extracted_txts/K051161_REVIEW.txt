Toxicology (91)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Refer to Indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
“QUEST DIAGNOSTICS HairCheck-DT (Amphetamines) is a test system
that utilizes the IDS One-Step ELISA MDMA/Methamphetamine Kit for the
qualitative detection of amphetamines at concentrations at or above 300 pg/mg
hair for the purpose of identifying chronic methamphetamine use and use of
MDMA. This test system has not been evaluated for use with other populations
or with hair specimens other than head. It is an in vitro diagnostic device intended
exclusively for in-house professional use only and not intended for sale to anyone.
The QUEST DIAGNOSTICS HairCheck-DT (Amphetamines) provides only a
preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method
must be used in order to obtain a confirmed result. Gas Chromatograph - Mass
Spectrometry operating in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode or GC/MS/MS
in selected reaction mode (SRM) is the preferred method with deuterated internal
standards. Other chemical confirmation methods are available. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse
test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are obtained.”

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The assay is for Prescription In-House Use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The device is for use with an automated microplate reader capable of measuring
at 450 and 630 nm. For confirmation testing, the sponsor uses an Agilent 5973N
GC/MS in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode using deuterated internal
standards.
I. Device Description:
The test obtaining clearance consists of two parts; a pre-analytical hair treatment
procedure and the screening assay. A proscribed collection and extraction method is
used to convert the solid matrix of hair to a measurable liquid matrix. The screening
assay, International Diagnostic Systems (IDS) Corporation One-Step ELISA
(Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) Methamphetamine Kit, is purchased by
Quest.
The screening portion of the test system consists of micro strip plates coated with
rabbit anti-methamphetamine polyclonal antibody, enzyme conjugate (horseradish
peroxidase conjugated to methamphetamine), substrate (containing
tetramethylbenzidine), a proprietary diluent, and wash solution.
In-house prepared calibrators and controls are utilized. These are prepared solutions
of methamphetamine added to negative matrix tubes.
As the IDS kit is a component of the test system, the sponsor described how kit
performance is validated. IDS performs a drift and precision procedure on selected
plates, as well as visual inspection of all plates. Quest performs a linearity check on
selected plates when they are received.
The procedures and reagents are briefly described in the “Test Principle” section,
below. Trade secret information was not provided to FDA. Specific details regarding
procedures and reagents provided by the sponsor have not been reproduced here
because the product is not intended for sale to others.
If the initial screen is positive, a GC/MS test is used to confirm the screen. GC/MS
samples are considered positive if: methamphetamine is present at 300 pg/mg hair
and amphetamine is present at 50 pg/mg hair. Alternatively, MDMA must be present
at 300 pg/mg hair and MDA present at 50 pg/mg hair.
The sponsor indicates there are no human source materials in their product, except for
hair. Hair is not known to be a biological risk.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle:
Pre-Analytical:
The test utilizes a 3.9 cm sample of head hair. Approximately 120 strands are taken
from 2-3 different sites, cut as close as possible to the scalp, preferably from the back
of the head at the crown. This amount of hair should weigh approximately 100–120
mg. In the laboratory the sample is cut from the root end, then cut into smaller
lengths and mixed to ensure homogeneity.
Specimens are prepared by weighing out twenty milligram aliquots of the hair. In
preparation for the screening test, an aliquot is washed with methanol for a brief
period of time, and the wash is discarded. This pre-wash is intended to rid the sample
of external contamination. Methanol is added to the hair and it is heated for two
hours. The methanol mixture is then transferred to a new tube and evaporated under
nitrogen. The tubes are reconstituted with 0.6 mL of phosphate buffer prior to testing.
To minimize hair matrix effects, calibrator and control stock solutions are added to a
negative matrix tube prior to analysis. To prepare these tubes 10 grams of hair from
non drug-users is weighed out and methanol is added. After soaking for a period of
time the methanol is discarded. One liter of methanol is added to the methanol-
washed hair and heated for 2 hours, then filtered. The collected methanol is diluted
with methanol to 1 liter. One mL aliquots are pipetted into tubes and evaporated to
dryness. Prior to analysis, 100 µL of prepared stock solutions of calibrator and
control are pipetted into the negative hair matrix tubes, and diluted with 1.9 mL of
phosphate buffer.

Screening Assay:
Unknown samples, calibrators, and controls, as described above, are assayed using
the IDS Methamphetamine Kit. The kit is a solid-phase micro-titer plate
immunoassay where labeled and unlabeled opiates bind to antibody. The two bind in
proportion to their concentration.
Each sample is added to a well, followed by the enzyme conjugate. During this phase
of incubation the enzyme-labeled drug conjugate competes with drug in the sample
for a limited number of binding sites on the antibody-coated microwells. A wash
solution is then applied to remove any unbound materials. Enzyme substrate solution
containing a chromagen is then added for the final color development process. The
reaction is stopped with an acid and the absorbance is read using a plate reader at 450
nm. A background reading is also taken at 630 nm. Color intensity is inversely
proportional to the amount of analyte present in the sample.
Interpretation of Screening Results:
Negative: Samples with an absorbance value higher than the Cutoff Calibrator
are interpreted as negative. Either the sample does not contain amphetamines or
amphetamines are present in concentrations below the cutoff level for the assay.
Presumptive Positive: Samples with an absorbance value equal to or lower than
the Cutoff Calibrator are presumptively positive and should be confirmed by an
alternative chemical method.
Other structurally similar compounds can produce positive results. Compounds that
are not structurally similar to amphetamines have not been observed to produce
positive results, however false positive screening results may occur because of non-
specific binding or other technical problems.
Confirmatory Testing:
Negative hair matrix tubes are used in the confirmatory process. As in the screening
procedure, control and calibrator solutions are added to the tubes prior to analysis.
Negative hair matrix tubes are prepared in a similar manner to those prepared for the
screening assay.
Confirmation testing is performed utilizing another aliquot from the original hair
specimen. A 20 mg sample of each donor hair sample is washed four times prior to
analysis. The first wash is performed with hexane. This wash is saved and analyzed
along with the donor sample. (The concentration of drug in the hexane wash is
multiplied by ten, and then subtracted from the GC/MS result prior to applying the
positive reporting criteria. This step is performed to mitigate the risk of external drug
contamination.) The hexane wash is followed by 3 additional methanol washes. Each
of these methanol washes is discarded.
Methanol is then added to the sample and it is heated for 2 hours. An acid/methanol
mixture is then added, and the liquid is transferred to another tube. It is evaporated to
4

--- Page 5 ---
dryness, and reconstituted with phosphate buffer.
A solid phase extraction is then performed on each standard, control, and unknown
specimen, followed by GC/MS analysis in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode using
deuterated internal standards. The hexane wash correction procedure is performed
prior to determining the final test result.
The sponsor has indicated that the specifications of their GC/MS system are as
follows:
Compound LOD LOQ ULOL (ULOC)
(pg/mg)hair (pg/mg)hair (pg/mg)hair (pg/mg)hair
Methamphetamine 50 50 50,000 50,000
Amphetamine 50 50 50,000 50,000
MDMA 50 50 10,000 10,000
MDA 50 50 10,000 10,000
LOD -The limit of detection is the lowest concentration of analyte that exhibits acceptable
chromatography and ion ratios within ± 20% of the calibrator.
LOQ - The limit of detection (LOQ) is lowest concentration of analyte that exhibits acceptable
chromatography, ion ratios within ± 20% of the calibrator and a calculated concentration within ± 20%
of the target concentration.
ULOL- The upper limit of linearity is defined as the highest concentration of analyte that exhibit
acceptable chromatography, ion ratios within ± 20% of the calibrator and a calculated concentration of
the highest standard is within ± 20% of the target concentration.
ULOC - The upper limit of carryover is the highest concentration that would produce no carryover of
drug into the specimen injected after a specimen with this concentration.
Interpretation of Confirmatory Testing Results:
Samples are considered positive if methamphetamine is present at 300 pg/mg hair
and amphetamine is present at 50 pg/mg hair. Alternatively, MDMA must be present
at 300 pg/mg hair and MDA present at 50 pg/mg hair.
For the run to be accepted, at least one control must be within 30% of the target
value. (If only one control passes, results are treated as qualitative results, rather than
quantitative results.) Evaluation of Negative Control: For a run to be acceptable, the
negative control must not have a quantitative value of the target analyte in excess of
the LOD.
Limitations of the Assay:
Performance of this assay in specific user populations has not been characterized.
Evaluation of this assay was limited to head hair samples from a drug-free population
and a retrospective analysis of laboratory historical records. The donor population in
the historical data was not fully characterized. Interpretation of results must take into
account that drug concentrations detected in hair from a single individual can vary
extensively depending on the site of collection. Positive screening results only
indicate the presumptive presence of methamphetamine and/or MDMA, and require
additional analysis by Gas Chromatography with mass spectrometry detection to

confirm the result. A negative screening result does not necessarily rule out the
possibility of methamphetamine or MDMA use, i.e., time of collection, frequency of
use, mode of ingestion, dosage used, hair types and other factors may influence
results. It is not possible to document all possible effects due to treatments such as
bleaching, straightening and dying. There is a possibility that other substances and/or
factors not evaluated in the interference studies may interfere with the test and cause
false results that cannot be confirmed by mass spectrometry, e.g. technical or
procedural errors.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Five solutions were prepared at 0, 0.5X, 1X, 1.5X and 2X of cutoff. These
solutions were prepared by spiking test tubes containing negative hair matrix
with the appropriate concentration of methamphetamine to provide the
percentages of cutoffs listed above. On day one, 15 replicates of each solution
were pipetted into individual wells on a microtiter plate and then analyzed by
the ELISA screening method listed above. The data from day 1 was used to
establish the Within-run precision for the ELISA screening method.
From these same solutions, 15 replicates were again analyzed in individual
wells on days 2 and 3. Data from all 3 days was used to determine the
Between-run precision, i.e., 45 replicates. One experienced laboratory
employee performed this study at Quest.
A total of 180 samples were assayed:
• 15X3 - 0.0 pg/mg methamphetamine (Negative)
• 15X3 - 150 pg/mg methamphetamine (50% cutoff)
• 15X3 - 300 pg/mg methamphetamine (100 % cutoff)
• 15X3 – 600 pg/mg methamphetamine (200% cutoff)
Within-run precision was determined from Day 1 data for each concentration
by calculating the mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation for
absorbance readings of 15 samples. Between-run precision was determined
by calculating the mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation for
each concentration, 45 samples each, over three days. Precision is expressed
as the percent coefficient of variation (%CV), where the standard deviation
divided by the mean times 100% is equal to the percent coefficient of
variation.

Within-run and Between-Run Precision using pooled extracts:
Within-run precision was determined by analyzing fifteen replicate samples of
pooled sample extracts. Results were similar to those of prepared solutions,
above.
Within-Run Precision using individual samples
Studies were done to characterize precision when replicate measurements of
single hair samples were analyzed. Five hair specimens, previously found to
contain measurable amounts of methamphetamine and amphetamine by GC/MS,
were analyzed. Each hair specimen was divided into 3 three aliquots of 20 mg
each. Each 20 mg aliquot was taken through the entire ELISA screening process
and measured in one run. The following table depicts the absorbance readings
(not normalized) of the analysis.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. This is a qualitative assay. Representative absorbances are
shown in the precision section, above.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Commercially purchased materials consisting of methamphetamine in
methanol are used to prepare a working solution. Working solutions are then
used to prepare calibrator and control solutions. (Calibrators and controls are
prepared in a similar manner, however, they are made from different reference
materials, each provided with a Certificate of Analysis.)
Assigned values of the gravimetrically prepared calibrator and control stock
solutions are verified by GC/MS analysis each time a new batch is prepared.
The calibrator must fall within 20% of the targeted concentration. The
sponsor indicates they have data on file to support the one year expiration date
for these solutions.
At the time of analysis, the prepared calibrator and control stock solutions are
pipetted into a negative matrix tube, and diluted with phosphate buffer. The
final concentrations are as follows:
• Positive Calibrator containing 300 pg/mg hair of methamphetamine
• Negative Blank Calibrator (negative matrix tube containing 0.0 pg/mg
hair of methamphetamine)
• Low Control containing 400 pg/mg hair of methamphetamine
• High Control containing 600 pg/mg hair of methamphetamine
Users are instructed to follow federal, state, and local regulatory guidelines
regarding quality control procedures.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (in pg/mg) was determined by calculating the mean
negative calibrator absorbance (A ) minus two times the SD (LOD= A -2SD).

The calculation of sensitivity was determined in hair matrix samples by
calculating the mean absorbance value of each set of 18 zero calibrators (blanks)
and adding two standard deviations for the corresponding group. To convert the
value from absorbance units to pg/mg concentration, a regression line was
constructed using the mean values of the zero standard, 225 pg/mg
methamphetamine standard, 300 pg/mg methamphetamine standard, and 375
pg/mg methamphetamine standard. Using the equation of the regression line (y =
0.05x + 1.920, r2 = 0.911), the absorbance value of the mean zero calibrator minus
two standard deviations was converted to pg/mg of methamphetamine and the
LOD was determined to be 75 pg/mg hair.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-Reactivity with structurally related compounds:
To determine cross-reactivity each compound was spiked into 46 mm phosphate
buffer containing negative hair matrix. Cross-reactivity was determined relative to
the (+) methamphetamine calibrator cut-off (300 pg/mg).
Serial dilutions of each potential cross-reactive compound were prepared and
analyzed by the IDS Methamphetamine/MDMA ELISA. Resulting absorbance
readings were plotted against the prepared concentration. The concentration of
each compound that generated the same absorbance reading as the cutoff
calibrator was extrapolated from the graph. The concentration of
methamphetamine in the cutoff calibrator was divided by the extrapolated
concentration of the structurally similar compound and then multiplied by 100.
(For example if it took 1200 pg/mg of a structurally similar compound to equal
the absorbance value of 300 pg/mg of methamphetamine then the cross reactivity
would be 300/1200 x 100% = 25%.)

Cross-Reactivity with structurally unrelated compounds:
Several (163) structurally unrelated compounds were added to 46 mm phosphate
buffer to a concentration of 10,000 ng/mL then added to negative hair matrix
tubes (equivalent to 300,000 pg/mg). Samples were analyzed along with
replicates of blank negative hair matrix tubes. The mean absorbance readings
from the samples were within 5% of the mean absorbance readings of the blank
negative hair matrix tubes.
Effect of Interfering Compounds:
The same 163 structurally unrelated compounds were also tested for possible
positive and negative interference with the Amphetamine ELISA assay. Two sets
of negative hair matrix were prepared by adding Methamphetamine to achieve
concentrations of at 200, 300 and 400 pg/mg hair. The second set of tubes was
additionally spiked with the 163 structurally unrelated compounds to a
concentration of 300,000 pg/mg hair. Absorbance readings of the tubes spiked
with the structurally unrelated compound were within 5% of the absorbance
readings of the negative hair matrix tube without the compound added.
There is a possibility that other substances and/or factors not listed above may
interfere with the test and cause false results e.g., technical or procedural errors.
Additional Analytical Studies:
Recovery studies/ Effectiveness of Screening Assay Extraction Method:
The screening assay employs a 2-hour methanolic extraction at 70oC to extract
amphetamines from hair. A study was done to demonstrate the effectiveness of
this procedure.

First, a standard of 100% recovery was established. According to the sponsor,
treatment of hair overnight with a dilute acid (0.1 N HCl) extracts weak bases
(like amphetamines) with near 100% efficiency. The hair can then be extracted by
a solid phase extraction technique. Methanol extraction results are compared to
this baseline.
Recovery of amphetamines from hair samples was tested using ten hair samples
that were previously confirmed positive for amphetamines. Two aliquots of each
sample were prepared. One of the aliquot was taken through the dilute acid
recovery extraction. The matching aliquot was taken through the screening
extraction and assay procedures described in Test Principle Section up to the point
of evaporating the methanolic extract. At that point, internal standard was added
to both aliquots and the solid phase extraction procedure used during confirmation
testing was performed, followed by GC/MS analysis. The table below illustrates
the results:

Effect of Cosmetic Treatments on Positive Assay Results:
The effects of various hair treatments (i.e. bleaching, dyeing, shampooing) on the
ELISA screening and GC/MS confirmation for amphetamines was examined.
Eighty previously screened and confirmed amphetamines positive hair specimens
were randomly assigned into one of the three cosmetic treatments (16 in each
group). Each group was subjected to one of the three treatments. ELISA
absorbance readings and GC/MS measurements before and after treatment were
taken. Treated results were compared to untreated results. Amphetamine and
Methamphetamine analytes were observed separately during GC/MS analysis.
Data is presented in tables, below where a decrease in Abs correlates to an
increase in concentration:

Hair Treatment Study with Negative Samples:
In a separate study, 30 previously screened negative specimens were randomly assigned
to the same cosmetic treatment groups. GC/MS confirmation was not performed on any
specimens for this experiment. After cosmetic treatment, all 30 specimens remained
negative. The percent difference between the mean normalized absorbance values of the
treated and untreated groups was –5.6%, 1.2% and 0.2% for bleaching, dyeing and
shampooing respectively.
In both studies, dyeing had the greatest effect. Screening absorbance readings became
more negative for the positive hair samples, and slightly more negative for the negative
hair samples. Note: the decrease in absorbance reading is equal to an apparent increase in
concentration. The following table compares the normalized absorbance readings of
untreated positive samples to the untreated negative samples.

Effectiveness of the Wash Procedure (Contamination Studies):
Two studies investigated whether confirmatory testing procedures were able to
distinguish between true analytically positive samples and those that have been
externally exposed to amphetamines. The first study involved exposing drug-free
hair to amphetamine compounds, performing confirmation testing on the samples and
observing the final test result. The second study involved performing confirmation
testing on known positive samples and observing whether the methanol wash
correction changes the final result.
Study # 1
Hair specimens (black and curly hair and blonde and straight samples from different lots)
previously screened negative were exposed for amphetamines to different drugs (in
separate experiments) by different exposure modes as listed in the table below. A twenty
mg aliquot of all hair samples was then analyzed by GC/MS.

All negative hair samples remained negative by GC/MS after being exposed to the four
drugs and exposure modes described above. Due to the low cross reactivity with the
screening ELISA, both amphetamine and MDA exposed hairs failed to give positive
screening results with the ELISA assay and thus remained negative after being subjected
to the exposure modes one to three.
Study # 2
Four clinically positive hair samples were selected for this study. All hair samples were
previously screened and confirmed positive.
GC/MS analysis performed on the four samples, i.e. washes and solid phase extraction.
All four samples remained positive. Results are presented below:

f. Assay cut-off:
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)
has not made any recommendations for cutoff concentrations for drugs of
abuse testing in hair.
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed
cutoff concentration appears in the precision section, above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance of the assay was evaluated with three ways:
- a prospective study of admitted drug users
- a prospective study of self-reported non-drug users
- a retrospective analysis of historical samples
Positive Agreement Study:
This study enrolled forty-four subjects from a drug rehabilitation clinic
admitting to methamphetamine use and with a positive urine test for
amphetamines. Almost all participants reported using methamphetamine at
least two times a week to daily. The methamphetamine drug history
ranged from 9 months to 27 years. Thirty four admitted poly-drug use that
included cocaine, marijuana, and alcohol in addition to methamphetamine.
Each subject had a matched urine and head hair sample.
Of the 44 volunteer subjects: 31 were Caucasian, 10 Hispanic, 2 Asian Pacific
and 1 African American. The subjects ranged in ages from 18 to 50 years old.
Of the 44 hair samples: 10 were medium brown, 16 were dark brown, 2 were
light brown, 5 were black, 7 were blonde, 2 were gray, 1 was orange and 1
was red. The curvature ranged from 32 straight and 12 curly.
All forty four (44) volunteers were positive for Amphetamines in their urine
using EMIT (1000 ng/mL cutoff - methamphetamine) and were confirmed
positive by GC/MS. All 44 samples contained methamphetamine (above the
500 ng/mL cut-off) and amphetamine (above 200 ng/mL) by GC/MS.
Forty three (43) of the 44 hair samples screened positive by ELISA (300
pg/mg hair cutoff). Forty (40) of the hair samples were confirmed positive for

pg/mg).
Three (3) of the forty four (44) samples that screened positive by ELISA
were QNS (quantity not sufficient) for confirmation. Hair specimen that
screened negative was discarded and not available for confirmation.
Three (3) of the subjects that are included in the category of 40 subjects
below were also positive GC/MS for MDMA in hair along with
Methamphetamine and Amphetamine combinations.

Negative Agreement Study:
Fifty two (52) individuals who self-reported that they were non-drug users
were enrolled in the study. Subjects provided urine and a hair sample. No
ages or race were collected on any of the volunteers. Of the fifty-two hair
specimens: 12 were black, 14 were dark brown, 11 were medium brown, 8
were light brown, 6 were blonde and 1 was red. The curvature ranged from
30 straight, 17 curly, and 5 kinky.
All fifty-two (52) urine samples screened negative for Amphetamines. The
urines were not confirmed by GC/MS. Fifty (50) of the hair samples screened
negative using ELISA (300 pg/mg hair cutoff) while two hair specimens
screened positive for Amphetamines. None of the 52 samples contained
measurable amounts of Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, MDMA and/or
MDA by GC/MS.
