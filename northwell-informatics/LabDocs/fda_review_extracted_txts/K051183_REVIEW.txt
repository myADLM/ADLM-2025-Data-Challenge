The BD Phoenix™ SMIC/ID and SMIC Panel is intended for the in vitro
rapid identification (ID) of bacteria from pure culture belonging to the genera
Streptococcus. The BD Phoenix™ SMIC/ID and SMIC panels are also
intended for the quantitative determination of antimicrobial susceptibility by
minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of most bacteria isolates from pure
culture belonging to the genera Streptococcus when used with the BD
Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System.
2. Indication(s) for use:
This submission is for the addition of the antibiotic gatifloxacin at
concentrations of 0.0625 – 8 µg/mL to the Phoenix™ SMIC/ID and SMIC
Streptococcus Panels.
3. Special condition for use statement(s):
Prescription Use Only
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST-S
Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and
equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™
Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST-S broth, which contains an
AST- S indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST-S broth is a non-blood, cation-
adjusted broth containing purified water, Tween 80, pancreatic digest of casein, peptones
and other additional supplements for optimization of streptococcal growth. After adding
the indicator solution to the AST – S inoculum, the color is blue, and after inoculation
and incubation, it changes to pink then colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds.
Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated
Microbiology System instrument where the panels are continuously incubated at 35°C.
The resulting AST has a final inoculum of 5 x 105 CFU/ml. The instrument incubates,
reads and records the results of the biochemical substrates and antimicrobial agents and
interprets the reactions to give an ID of the isolate and MIC value and category
interpretation of the antimicrobial agents. Organisms growing in the presence of a given
antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator, signaling organism growth and resistance to the
antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or inhibited by a given antimicrobic do not cause
reduction of the indicator and therefore do not produce a color change. Additional
interpretation is done using software driven “EXPERT” System using rules derived from
the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI).

Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an ID result available between 2-12 hours and
an AST result available between 4-16 hours. This is only an autoread result; there are no
manual readings possible.

L. Test Principle:
The system employs conventional, colorimetric, fluorogenic and chromogenic
substrates to identify the genus and species of the isolate. The AST portion of the BD
Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth based microdilution method
that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance detection
of organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells
containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control
wells” which contain no antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Thirty on-scale isolates were evaluated for site to site and inter site
reproducibility demonstrating >95% reproducibility. The ten isolate
study described in the guidance document was used (10 organisms
tested 3 times on 3 days at 3 sites).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or method):
CLSI recommended Quality Control strain was tested at the
concentrations listed (see table below). The Phoenix™ results
demonstrated that the system can produce QC results in the
recommended range. The modes for the reference method and the
Phoenix™ were the same.

Inoculum density control: The organism suspension density of the
ID broth was equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard using the
BBL™ CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer which was verified each day of
testing. Internal data was used to demonstrate that the use of the
BBL™ CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer would produce reproducible
results. Five different instruments were used. Additional testing on
5 streptococcal strains was performed to demonstrate acceptable
performance for streptococcal species.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device: The CLSI
recommended broth dilution reference panel with 2 - 5% lysed horse
blood was prepared according to the CLSI recommendation and used to
compare with the Phoenix™ results. Clinical testing was performed at
four sites. The testing included both fresh clinical isolates and stock
isolates along with a challenge set with known results. The study
included 1939 isolates with the following performance.
