Values are assigned using four Elecsys® MODULAR ANALYTICS E170
Immunoassay Analyzers, four ELECSYS® 2010 Immunoassay Analyzers and
four ELECSYS® 1010 Immunoassay Analyzers. Two independent series of
analyses are performed on each instrument. Each sample is tested in
duplicate. The target value is then calculated as the median of the determined
values. Approximate target values are found in the following table. Lot-
specific target values may differ slightly after value assignment.
CA 19-9 CalCheck™ Level CA 19-9 Target Values
IU/mL
Check 1 (low) <5
Check 2 (medium) 179
Check 3 (high) 676
Stability: Two studies were performed in order to verify the stability claims
for the Elecsys® CA 19-9 CalCheck™.

Study 1: Accelerated Stability. The CA 19-9 CalCheck™ on-test material was
stored at 35º C for 3 weeks. At the end of three weeks, it was analyzed in
duplicate with a reference material (master calibrators stored at 4-8º C). The
product met the acceptance criterion (90%-110% of the reference value). The
sponsor will test for real-time stability.
Study 2: Reconstituted Material: Stability of the reconstituted product and
reconstituted reference material are tested in duplicate. The product is
reconstituted, stored for four hours at 25º C. The reference is a freshly
reconstituted set of CA 19-9 CalCheck materials. The product met the stated
acceptance criterion (90%-110% of the reference value) to support the
stability claim of 4 hours at 20-25º C.
