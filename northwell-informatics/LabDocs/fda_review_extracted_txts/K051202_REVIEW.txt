4. Panel:
83 Microbiology
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
For use with MicroScan® Dried Gram Positive MIC/Combo, Dried Gram
Positive Breakpoint Combo and Dried Gram Positive ID Type 2 panels.
MicroScan® Positive panels are designed for use in determining antimicrobial
agent susceptibility and/or identification to the species level of rapidly growing
aerobic and facultatively gram-positive cocci, some fastidious aerobic gram
positive cocci and Listeria monocytogenes. Refer to Limitation of Procedure
Section for use with fastidious streptococci.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The MicroScan® Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel is used to determine
quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies
grown on solid media of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram
positive cocci. This indication is for the addition of the antimicrobial vancomycin
at concentrations of 0.25-128 µg/mL to the test panel.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The Prompt® method of inoculation is an alternate method of inoculation
preparation that is supported in the methodology along with the turbidity method.
The stationary and log inoculum methods should not be used with this antibiotic.
4. Special instrument requirements:
These panels can be read at > 16 hours of incubation either manually,
automatically on the autoSCAN® 4, or with the WalkAway® instrument systems
but for best detection of VRSA readings should be performed after 18 hours
especially for the autoSCAN® 4 instrument read results.
I. Device Description:
The MicroScan® Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel contains microdilutions of
each antimicrobial agent in various concentrations with Mueller Hinton Broth and
various nutrients which are dehydrated and dried in panels. Each panel contains two
control wells: a no-growth control well (contains water only/no nutrients or broth),
and a growth control well (contains test medium without antibiotic). The panel is
rehydrated and inoculated at the same time with 0.1 ml of suspension prepared by the
2

--- Page 3 ---
turbidity method (inoculum prepared in water, then 0.1ml transferred to 25ml of
inoculum water containing pluronic-D/F-a wetting solution) for a final inoculum
concentration of 3-7 X 105 CFU/ml. The Prompt® method of inoculation is also
recommended as an alternate means of preparing the inoculum. The panels are
incubated at 35o C in a non-CO for 16-24 hours and read by visual observation of
2
growth. Panels may also be read automatically with the WalkAway® or the
AutoSCAN®4.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) M7 (M100-S15) “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
After incubation in a non-CO incubator for 16-24 hours, the minimum inhibitory
2
concentration (MIC) for the test organisms are read by determining the lowest
antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth. The panels are read either
manually using a touchSCAN® SR, or with the autoSCAN® 4 or the WalkAway®
instrument, which uses an optics systems with growth algorithms to directly measure
organism growth.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 5 isolates tested at 2 sites and
included the three VRSA and two QC strains. Three reading methods and two
inoculation methods were tested at one site and the other site tested in
replicates of three with each inoculation method using the manual reading
method only. The QC strains were additionally tested at 5 sites using all
methods. The following table provides the overall results for all combinations
of these variables. This represents the reproducibility of each method based
on the mode of that method and not the expected value.

Quality control results demonstrated the ability of all variables of the
procedure (reading and inoculation) to produce acceptable results.
There does appear to be slight trending in all of the methods for both
QC strains to appear one dilution more resistant than the reference
method result but still in the expected range an acceptable number of
times. This is even more apparent with the Prompt® method of
inoculation and the S. aureus QC strain.
Inoculum density control: A turbidity meter was used for the
turbidity inoculation method. The Prompt® method of inoculation
had colony counts performed periodically throughout the study to
determine the average inoculum density since there is no visual
check of the inoculum using this device. QC strains were also
included in the colony count study. The inoculum with the Prompt®
method of inoculation generally provides a higher number of CFU
with more variability than a method using turbidity meter although
the S. aureus did have more variability even in the turbidity method
but the average was still in the acceptable range for the turbidity
method but not for the Prompt®. There are limitations for the use
of the Prompt® and certain antibiotics that are more sensitive to
inoculum concentration and those are stated in the package insert.
Vancomycin will require no such statement. The chart below shows
the CFU study results.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The study was conducted at 5 sites. One hundred seventy two clinical
isolates were tested and 106 challenge isolates. Challenge set includes the
CDC Enterococci challenge set which includes 11 Van A, 19 Van B, 5
Van C1 and 5 Van C2. Also included were 53 Staphylococci from the
Network on Antimicrobial Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (NARSA)
which have interpretations near the intermediate breakpoint. This set also
included the three known VRSA strains tested at MicroScan®. The
results were compared to the reference expected results. The following
table demonstrates the performance based on essential agreement and
category agreement for the overall performance of the clinical isolates and
the challenge with the turbidity method of inoculation and manual
readings. Similar calculations for the different inoculation and reading
methods were performed with very little difference.

CA-Category Agreement vmj-very major discrepancies
R-resistant isolates min- minor discrepancies
Evaluable results are those that fall within the test range of the reference
method and could also be on-scale with the new device if within the
plus/minus one dilution variability. EA is when there is agreement
between the reference method and the MicroScan® within plus or minus
one serial two-fold dilution of antibiotic. CA is when the interpretation of
the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the
MicroScan® result.
The table below demonstrates the clinical and challenge results that were
in exact agreement with the reference method result and those that differed
by one or more dilutions.
Difference in the number of dilutions between the reference result and the MicroScan®
Result

There appears to be a slight trend of the MicroScan® to be more
resistant than the reference method (more values in the plus
category). This is even more exaggerated using the Prompt®
method of inoculation but still in EA at >95% with all read methods.
This trend to slightly more resistant results for the Prompt® method
of inoculation is consistent with the reproducibility data and also the
higher CFU/ml in the Prompt® inoculum.
