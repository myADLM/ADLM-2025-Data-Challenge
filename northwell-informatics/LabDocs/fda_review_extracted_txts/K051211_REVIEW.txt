3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The assay is to be used in conjunction with other evaluations and methods for
monitoring Zonisamide concentrations.
It may be necessary to obtain multiple samples to determine expected variation of
optimal (steady-state) concentrations for individual patients.
See expected range below.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The assay has currently only been validated on the Hitachi 717.
I. Device Description:
The device consists of ready-to-use reagents containing rabbit polyclonal zonisamide
antibodies in buffer (R1), and zonisamide-coated microparticles with (R2), both with
azide preservative.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s): Innofluor Phenytoin Assay
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s): K955562
3. Comparison with predicate: The predicate device is a fluorescence polarization
immunoassay that quantitates phenytoin in serum. Both assays are for use in
management of individuals treated with an anti-seizure drug. Both devices are for
use on automated analyzers.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
L. Test Principle: The assay is a homogeneous particle-enhanced turbidimetric assay,
based on antibody-binding competition between drug in the sample and microparticle-
bound drug. Antibody binding causes microparticle agglutination. The rate of
absorbance, measured spectrophotometrically is proportional to the rate of agglutination.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable): Performance was validated on
a Hitachi 717 instrument.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed at Seradyn and at 2 external laboratories.
The first study, performed at the manufacturer’s site, followed CLSI EP5-A.
One operator performed the evaluation, with a minimum of 2 hours between
runs. Calibration was performed once. Precision was evaluated using control
material as well as pooled samples from patients taking zonisamide. One
reagent lot was used. Results are shown below.

A second study was performed at 2 external sites. For control samples, the
protocol followed CLSI EP-5A. For patient samples, the protocol was
modified so that single measurements were taken, two times each day, over
non-consecutive days. Instruments were calibrated at the beginning of the
evaluation, and then as needed for quality control processes. Results obtained
at one of the external sites are shown below.

(both serum and plasma). A representative graph is shown below, indicating
good reproducibility between the two sites.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The assay range is 3-50 ug/mL.
Linearity across this range was demonstrated by measurements of serial
dilutions of a stock solution of pharmaceutical grade zonisamide in human
serum (negative for zonisamide). Samples ranged between 2.5 ug/ml and the
upper limit of the assay range. Solutions were assayed n=5 for each of 2
independently calibrated runs. Percents recovery were calculated as QMS®
assay concentration/target concentration. Above 4 ug/mL, recovery was
within +/-10%. Acceptance criteria for recovery at the assay limit of
quantitation is +/- 15%. Results of a calibrator dilution study confirmed
linearity within the assay range.
Samples from a zonisamide proficiency testing program were also used to
evaluate recovery. Results are tabulated below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators consist of pharmaceutical grade zonisamide gravimetrically spiked
into human serum containing preservatives. Calibrator target concentrations
are 0, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 ug/mL zonisamide. Nominal values are confirmed
by a validated HPLC method. Primary calibrators are accepted if recovered
by HPLC within +/- 10% of the nominal values. Working calibrators are
accepted if recovered (on the Hitachi 717 calibrated with primary calibrators)
within +/- 5% of the nominal value.
Ongoing real-time testing for calibrator stability is performed at 6, 12 and 18
months to ensure stability within 10% of the original HPLC value.
d. Detection limit:
Inter-assay precision at the detection limit was determined for serum samples
spiked with zonisamide at multiple concentrations near the low end of the
assay range. The evaluation was performed on 3 separate analyzers. Each
sample was run in replicates of 10, for 2 runs, for a total n=60 at each
zonisamide level evaluated. Results are shown below for concentrations near
the lower limit of the assay range. Results support the sponsor’s acceptance
criteria of CV of 20% and recovery within +/- 15% at the limit of quantitation.

e. Analytical specificity:
The assay was evaluated for potential interference from the zonisamide
metabolites NAZ (N-acetyl zonisamide) and SMAP (2-sulfamoylacetyl
phenol); commonly co-administered and OTC drugs and other compounds;
and endogenous interferents. Potential interferents were spiked into 3 serum
pools, each containing 0, 12, or 36 ug/mL zonisamide. Samples were
evaluated in triplicate and interference was evaluated by comparison to
control samples without interferent. The concentrations of metabolites and
endogenous compounds tested are shown below. The commonly co-
administered drugs tested are listed in the package insert.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Results obtained with the QMS® assay were compared to results of validated
HPLC methods performed at 3 separate clinical laboratory reference sites.
Samples were serum and plasma samples, previously received for evaluation
at the reference laboratories. No specific selection criteria (in terms of patient
demographics) were applied. Most samples were banked, frozen samples.
Minimally, 40% of the samples represent individual patients. The table below
lists results summary provided by the sponsor, using Passing Bablok analysis.

b. Matrix comparison:
Linearity, precision, sensitivity and method comparison studies used both
serum and plasma samples. Similar performance was observed for both.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity: NA. Not typically submitted for this type of assay.
b. Clinical specificity: NA. Not typical for this type of assay.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): The
sponsor provided balanced and representative literature discussing
measurement of zonisamide for clinical use.
4. Clinical cut-off: see expected values.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
A therapeutic range for zonisamide has not been well-established and there is no clear
relationship between zonisamide serum concentrations and clinical response.
Considerable overlap in zonisamide concentrations has been observed between serum
responders and non-responders as well as between serum levels associated with
seizure control and adverse effects. According to some reports (see package insert for
references), adverse effects are more commonly associated with patients with
zonisamide concentrations above 30 ug/mL.
