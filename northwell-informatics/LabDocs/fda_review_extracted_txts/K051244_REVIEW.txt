Rapid chromatographic immunoassay that differentiates influenza A from influenza B
virus
E. Applicant:

4. Panel: 83 Microbiology
H. Intended Use:
The OSOM Influenza A&B Test is an in vitro diagnostic
immunochromatographic assay intended for the qualitative detection of influenza
A and influenza B viral antigens from nasal swab specimens. It is intended to aid
in the rapid differential diagnosis of influenza A and/or B viral infections. A

evaluated. The user is responsible for determining the cross-reactivity of
other respiratory viruses with this test.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
None
I. Device Description:
The OSOM Influenza A&B Test consists of a test stick that separately detects
influenza A and B. The test procedure requires the solubilization of the
nucleoproteins from a swab by mixing the swab in Extraction Buffer. The test
stick is then placed in the sample mixture, which then migrates along the
membrane surface. If influenza A and/or B viral antigens are present in the
sample, it will form a complex with mouse monoclonal IgG antibodies to
influenza A and/or B nucleoproteins conjugated to colloidal gold. The
complex will then be bound by another mouse anti-influenza A and/or B antibody
coated on the nitrocellulose membrane. A pink to purple control line must appear
in the control region of the stick for results to be valid. The appearance of a
second and possibly a third light pink to purple line will appear in the test line
region indicating an A, B or A and B positive result.

Assay Reproducibility
A reproducibility proficiency study was conducted to demonstrate that the OSOM
Influenza A&B Test will perform acceptably in the hands of nurses, nurse practitioners
and physicians’ office personnel. A panel of swabs including negative (no virus), strong
negative (below the limit of detection), low (near the limit of detection) and mid viral
levels for influenza A and B were coded and masked to the operators. This study was
conducted with three operators at three health centers in the eastern United States (2
physician’s offices and 1 clinic site) and at Genzyme Diagnostics. The overall accuracy
was 97% for flu A and 94% for flu B. Two invalid tests were considered as incorrect
results in each analysis.

Influenza A/B Panel testing
A total of 46 human and animal influenza strains were tested with the OSOM
Influenza A&B test. Viral titers (TCID ) for A/Kitakyushu/159/93 (H3N2) and
50
B/Lee/40 were determined by inoculating MDCK cells, followed by standard
procedures for cell culture viral assays. Aliquots of these controls with known
TCID were then used to establish a standard curve in an ELISA assay. The
50
concentrations of other influenza viruses were determined indirectly using the
ELISA assay after the viruses had been inactivated. Influenza viruses were tested
at an ELISA estimated TCID as listed in the table below.
50
All influenza virus isolates gave positive results with the test line at the expected
location for the A, B and animal (positive for influenza A) isolates.

3. Clinical studies : A clinical trial was conducted during the 2004-2005 flu season
in the United States at sites located in the east, central and west regions to establish
the clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity of the OSOM Influenza A&B Test in
detecting influenza A and influenza B antigens in nasal swab specimens. Sites
included family practice and pediatric offices, emergency departments and clinics.
All clinical samples were collected from patients with flu-like symptoms including
fever, dry cough and myalgia. Nasal swab specimens were collected from a total of
383 subjects enrolled in the study. Of the 383 samples, 132 samples were from
pediatric subjects (2-19 years) and 251 samples were from adults (> 20 years). The
OSOM Influenza A&B Test was compared to cell culture to determine the
comparative clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity for detection of influenza A
and influenza B in nasal swab specimens
