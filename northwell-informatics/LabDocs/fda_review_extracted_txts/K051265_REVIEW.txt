L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA IMS BNP assay is a fully automated two-site sandwich immunoassay
using direct chemiluminescent technology, which uses two monoclonal antibodies.
The first antibody, in Reagent 1 (R1) is a FITC-labeled monoclonal mouse anti-
human BNP F(ab’)2 fragment specific to the ring structure of BNP. The second
antibody, in Reagent 2 (R2), is an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) conjugated monoclonal
mouse anti-human antibody specific to the C-terminal portion of BNP. The sandwich
complex formed by the analyte and the antibody conjugates are captured by the
magnetic particles so that the BNP concentration in the sample can be measured in
terms of enzyme activity. A direct relationship exists between the amount of BNP
present in the patient sample and the amount of relative luminescence counts detected
by the system.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three levels of control were assayed 4 times in 20 runs on 2 systems (n=160
for each sample), over a period of 20 days. The results are presented in the
table below:
Concentration Within-run SD Within-run Total SD pg/mL Total % CV
pg/mL (pmol/L) pg/mL (pmol/L) % CV (pmol/L)
71 (20.5) 2.83 (0.82) 4.0 2.89 (0.84) 4.1
716 (206.9) 11.47 (3.31) 1.65 13.77 (3.97) 1.9
2660 (768.74) 38.62 (11.16) 1.5 48.47 (14.01) 1.8
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity was assessed by mixing plasma samples with high BNP
concentration in various proportions with patient samples containing low
levels of BNP. When compared to the expected value, the measured
(recovered) values of BNP averaged 98.5% with a range of 84 to 109%. The
reportable range is <4 to 6000 pg/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ADVIA IMS BNP assay is traceable to an internal standard manufactured
using synthetic human BNP (amino acid 77-108). Assigned calibrator doses
and ranges for quality control material are traceable to this standardization.

d. Detection limit:
The Minimum Detectable Concentration (MDC) was determined based on the
mean and two times within-run standard deviations of the reaction rate for
level one calibrator. The MDC was calculated to be approximately 4 pg/mL.
The functional sensitivity is defined as the lowest BNP concentration
determined at a CV of 20%. The functional sensitivity was determined to be
10 pg/mL
e. Analytical specificity:
Less than a 10% change in results was seen in results for specimens with up to
750 mg/dL hemoglobin, 800 mg/dL triglycerides, 1000 mg/dL cholesterol,
200 mg/dL urea, 2.5 mg/dL creatinine, 25 mg/dL bilirubin, 7000 mg/dL
albumin and 4600 mg/dL IgG.
A total of 39 commonly used pharmaceutical drugs were added to human
plasma-based samples at two times the maximum therapeutic dosage and
evaluated for potential interference. The results demonstrated ≤ 10%
interference from each drug.
The drug Neseritide is a synthetic form of BNP-32 which is thought to be
virtually identical to the endogenous active hormone BNP. The Bayer BNP
assays measure Neseritide as BNP. The following statement in the labeling
addresses the use of the test with patients receiving Neseritide:
It has been reported that patients with acute decompensated heart failure who are
candidates for nesiritide (recombinant BNP) infusion should have a baseline BNP
measurement taken prior to initiation of therapy. Measurements taken during
infusion are reflective of the dose of nesiritide. Because of the short half-life of BNP
(20 minutes), measurements taken 2 hours after the cessation of treatment again
reflect the level of endogenous BNP. It has also been reported that following
infusion, endogenous BNP levels return to baseline by 1-2 hours and continue to
drop at 6 hours to about 80% of preinfusion levels, suggesting a resetting of the
neuro-hormonal axis and improvement in ventricular wall tension as a result of
treatment. The ADVIA Centaur and ACS:180 BNP assays are not approved for
nesiritide monitoring.
f. Assay cut-off:
See clinical cutoff below
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical correlation studies were performed comparing the ADVIA IMS
System to the ADVIA Centaur System using plasma samples. The correlation
is as follows: BNP y = 0.990x + 4.37, r = 0.992, n = 360, range 4-4531 pg/mL

4. Clinical cut-off:
The decision threshold for diagnosing heart failure was determined based on the
BNP level at the 95th percentile of the Reference Group. The most appropriate
decision threshold for diagnosing heart failure apparent from these distributions is
100 pg/mL. This BNP value translates into a general specificity of the test of
greater than 97 %.
The decision threshold for predicting survival and future heart failure in patients
with acute coronary syndromes is 80 pg/mL.
Prognostic Utility in Patients with Acute Coronary Syndromes:
Two independent retrospective studies have demonstrated the prognostic utility of
BNP. In the first study, BNP was assayed on 438 patients with myocardial
infarction (MI) from the ENTIRE-TIMI 23 multi-national trial. The baseline BNP
level was significantly higher in patients who died within 30 days (n=15, 89
pg/mL; 25th-75th, 40-192 pg/mL) compared to survivors (n = 423, 15 pg/mL;
25th-75th, 8.8-32 pg/mL, p<0.0001). BNP levels greater than 80 pg/mL were
associated with a substantially higher risk of death through 30 days of follow-up
(17.4% vs. 1.8%, p<0.0001). The odds ratio for death within 30 days for patients
with BNP levels greater than 80 pg/mL was 11.5. The odds ratio for death within
30 days for patients with BNP levels greater than 80 pg/mL, adjusted for age,
history of hypertension, and prior angina, was 8.3 with a 95% confidence interval
of 2.7 to 25.8. Patients with elevated BNP levels also had an increased risk of
composite end points for death and heart failure combined (23.9% vs. 5.1%,
p<0.0001). The odds ratio for death or heart failure within 30 days for patients
with BNP levels greater than 80 pg/mL was 5.8. The odds ratio for death or heart
failure within 30 days for patients with BNP levels greater than 80 pg/mL,
adjusted for age, history of heart failure, history of hypertension, and prior angina,
was 3.6 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.5 to 8.8. Elevated levels of BNP at
initial presentation are associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients
with MI.
Another study was performed on 2525 patients with acute coronary syndromes
(ACS). Patients with a BNP level of more than 80 pg/ml were significantly more
likely to die, have a new recurrent infarction, or have new or progressive heart
failure than those with a level of 80 pg/ml or less. After adjustment for other
independent predictors of the long-term risk of death, a BNP level of more than
80 pg/ml remained significantly associated with an increased 10-month mortality
rate (P= 0.04).
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected results for the ADVIA Centaur BNP assay were previously
established in k031038 and will be included in the labeling for the ADVIA IMS
BNP. The circulating BNP concentration was determined from 1521 individuals
without heart failure (785 women and 736 men). This population included
7

--- Page 8 ---
apparently healthy individuals and individuals with hypertension, diabetes, renal
insufficiency, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The descriptive
statistics for BNP concentrations in the population without heart failure are shown
in the following tables. These values are representative of the results obtained
from clinical studies. Clinical studies indicate that BNP levels increase with age
in the general population with the highest values seen in individuals greater than
75 years of age. In this subgroup of patients, age needs to be taken into
consideration for accurate interpretation of test results.

Patients with Heart Failure
To establish the expected results for the ADVIA Centaur BNP assay in
individuals with heart failure, plasma samples were obtained from 722
patients diagnosed with heart failure (264 women and 458 men). The
descriptive statistics for BNP concentrations in patients with heart failure are
presented in the following tables. These values are representative of the
results obtained from clinical studies. In addition, laboratories should be
aware of their respective institution’s current practice for the evaluation of
heart failure.
