4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST-S
Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and
equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™
Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST-S broth, which contains an
AST- S indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST-S broth is a non-blood, cation-
adjusted broth containing purified water, Tween 80, pancreatic digest of casein, peptones
and other additional supplements for optimization of streptococcal growth. After adding
the indicator solution to the AST- S inoculum, the color is blue, and after inoculation and
incubation, it changes to pink then colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds.
Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated
Microbiology System instrument where the panels are continuously incubated at 35°C.
The resulting AST has a final inoculum of 5 x 105 CFU/ml. The instrument incubates,
reads and records the results of the biochemical substrates and antimicrobial agents and
interprets the reactions to give an ID of the isolate and MIC value and category
interpretation of the antimicrobial agents. Organisms growing in the presence of a given
antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator, signaling organism growth and resistance to the
antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or inhibited by a given antimicrobic do not cause
reduction of the indicator and therefore do not produce a color change. Additional
interpretation is done using software driven “EXPERT” System using rules derived from
the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI).
Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an ID result available between 2-12 hours and
an AST result available between 4-16 hours. This is only an autoread result; there are no
manual readings possible.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S15) “Methods for
Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard.”
L. Test Principle:
The system employs conventional, colorimetric, fluorogenic and chromogenic
substrates to identify the genus and species of the isolate. The AST portion of the BD
Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth based microdilution method
that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance detection
of organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells
containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control
wells” which contains no antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Thirty three isolates were evaluated for site to site and inter site
reproducibility demonstrating >95% reproducibility. The ten isolate study
described in the guidance document was used (10 organisms tested 3 times on
3 days at 3 sites).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The FDA and CLSI recommended QC isolate, S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619
was tested on every test occasion with the reference method and the BD
Phoenix™. The reference method QC results were in range for every day
tested. The BD Phoenix™ was tested a sufficient number of times to
demonstrate that the system can produce QC results in the CLSI
recommended ranges. The modes of the BD Phoenix™ and reference method
were different where the mode of the reference method was one dilution
higher than the BD Phoenix™ but still in the acceptable range. Another QC
organism S. pneumoniae 3951 was also tested where both the BD Phoenix™
and the reference method had the same mode. However, only S. pneumoniae
ATCC 49619 will be recommended for use by the manufacturer.

CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer which was verified each day of testing.
Internal data was used to demonstrate that the use of the BBL™
CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer would produce reproducible results.
Five different instruments were used. Five Streptococcal strains were evaluated
to demonstrate acceptable reproducibility performance.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The CLSI recommended broth dilution reference panel was prepared
according to the CLSI recommendation. Clinical testing was performed at
four sites. The broth reference panel was set up on MH supplemented with
2% to 5% lysed horse blood as recommended by CLSI. The testing included
both fresh clinical isolates and stock isolates along with a challenge set with
known results. The test device had a growth rate of >95%. A comparison
was provided to the reference method with the following agreement.

EA-Essential Agreement CA-Category Agreement
NS-Not susceptible
Essential agreement (EA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panels agree with the
reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference
method. Category agreement (CA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panel result
interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation.
Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the BD Phoenix™ and
the reference and have on-scale EA.
There appears to be a trend where the reference device is slightly more resistant
than the test device as reflected in the Accuracy and the QC studies however results
are still within essential agreement.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The ability of the BD Phoenix™ system to detect resistance to linezolid in
Streptococcus spp. is unknown because resistant organisms were not available at
the time of comparative testing. Strains yielding MIC results suggestive of a
“non-susceptible” category should be submitted to a reference laboratory for
further testing.
