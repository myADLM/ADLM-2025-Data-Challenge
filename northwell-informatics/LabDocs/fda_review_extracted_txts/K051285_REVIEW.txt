L. Test Principle:
The Test Principle used by this device is electrochemical biosensor technology using
Glucose Oxidase. The strip uses the enzyme Glucose Oxidase to produce an electrical
current that will stimulate a chemical reaction. This reaction is measured by the
GlucoLab™ meter and displayed as a blood glucose result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor indicated precision studies were assessed by taking 4mL
of blood that was treated with EDTA drawn in a vacuum tube.
Glucose was added to the 4 mL of blood to generate 5 different
levels of glucose concentrations for the test. Each of the samples
was measured 5 times for precision.

--- Page 6 ---
Page 6 of 18
Day-to-Day precision also known as Between Day Precision
The sponsor prepared three control solutions of Low, Normal and
High. Each of the controls was measured twice a day, once in the
morning and once in the afternoon for a month.
Table 1 (below) shows a summary of the Within-Run Precision and
the Day-to-Day Precision Tests.

Test Procedure (Dilution Schemes)

--- Page 7 ---
Page 7 of 18
The claimed detection range for the GlucoLab Blood Glucose
Monitoring System is 10-600 mg/dL. The linearity study presented
in this submission that utilizes NCCLS EP6-A with the
recommended dilution schemes did not challenge the lower (10-40
mg/dL) or upper (550-600 mg/dL) claimed detection range. So the
sponsor performed two additional studies of 30 different paired
samples that compared the GlucoLab at the 10-40 mg/dL range and
the 550-600 mg/dL range to the YSI analyzer (reference). In the first
study the glucose range tested was 10-39 mg/dL with the following
correlation:
y = 0.9779x + 0.4296
R2 = 0.9869
n = 30
In the second study the glucose range tested was 550-598 mg/dL
with the following correlation:
y = 0.9791x + 15.162
R2 = 0.974
n = 30
The NCCLS EP6-P2 recommends dilution schemes to estimate the
linearity of the Quantitative Analytical Method.
According to the NCCLS EP6-P2 protocol, a blood sample of 25 mL
was taken, treated with the EDTA in a vacuum tube, and let set for a
day. Two glucose concentrations of 10 mL (high and low
concentrations) were prepared. As a measuring tool, nine glucose
concentrations were prepared using the following dilution schemes
(see Table 2).

Level 9(High, H) H
The meter used in this test can display below 10 mg/dL and over 600 mg/dL for checking
linear range.
Each of the glucose levels was measured 5 times to test for precision.
In order to evaluate the straight line for the Sensory Strip that was used, the following
formula was used:
1st order polynomial, y = ax + b, 2nd order polynomial, y = aX2 + bX + c
All dilution schemes start with a high and low concentration samples in which the
concentrations meet or exceed the range of interest. For the test, the highest and lowest
glucose concentration used was 661mg/dL and 8mg/dL. If a strip sensor has an ideal
linearity (r2=1) from Lowest to highest concentration, the ideal concentration of level 2
mixed with 0.875L and 0.125H volume ratio is a 99mg/dL [(0.875*37.4 +
0.125*530.2)/(0.875+0.125)].

precision.

It has been determined that the polynomial evaluation of linearity assumes that the data
set is not linear. This approach assumes that the data points fall perfectly on a line or
curve in the absence of random error. The method consists of two parts. The first part
examines whether a nonlinear polynomial fits the data better than a linear one. The
second part assesses whether the difference between the best-fitting nonlinear and linear
polynomial is less than the amount of allowable bias for the method, which should be
predefined.

The nonlinear 2nd fits the data better than a linear one, but the difference is lower than 4.3
mg/dL from 8.2 mg/dL to 661.8mg/dL. The R2 of 1st order regression is a 0.9988
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
Traceability referenced to NBS, NIST Standards
Users are directed to use the control solutions before the expiration
date printed on the bottle. The controls are stable for three months
after opened.
d. Detection limit:
Reportable range = 10 – 600 mg/dL
1.7 to 33.3 mmol/L
See linearity study above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was conducted to determine the effect of select
endogenous and exogenous substances.
Hematocrit Study
In this study, approximately 2 mL of blood was taken from 64 random diabetic
individuals. The blood samples were treated with the EDTA vacuum tube and the
glucose concentration was adjusted to approximately 50 - 580 mg/dL by adding an
adequate amount of the phosphate buffer (20mM with pH 7.4) that contains a different
level of glucose. In order to adjust the Hematocrit value (30 ~ 55%), a proper volume of
the centrifuged plasma (serum) was removed.
The Hematocrit level and glucose concentration in the blood was assessed by using the
Nova Stat Profile M and the YSI2300 STAT (respectively).

The % bias of the assay value of the GlucoLab™ system is relative to the YSI and does
not have a negative or positive correlation to hematocrit level in this experiment. 98% of
the data is within +/- 20% bias and 86% lies within +/- 10% in the overall range of
glucose and hematocrit.
The potential interference of various exogenous and endogenous substances was tested
by spiking the levels listed below in Table 5 into non-spiked control samples. The results
were compared and the % error was calculated for the highest level tested.

The sponsor states that high test concentrations were referenced to NCCLS Document
EP7-P.
The sponsor states that:
• Acetaminophen, uric acid, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and other reducing
substances (when occurring in normal blood or normal therapeutic
concentrations) do not significantly affect results. However, abnormally high
concentrations in blood may cause inaccurately high results.
• Cholesterol up to 500 mg/dL or triglycerides up to 2890 mg/dl do not
significantly affect the results. Glucose values, however, in specimens beyond
these levels should be interpreted with caution.
• Blood samples that contain a high concentration of dissolved oxygen may lower
the test result.
• Tolazamide or Gentistic acid treatment may increase the test result.
• Antiglycolytic agents and anticoagulants in blood samples may affect the test
results.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison to the predicate device was assessed with One hundred sixty
subjects with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes during a normally scheduled clinic visits. In
the study protocol, both the lay user and a trained technician obtained fingerstick

--- Page 13 ---
Page 13 of 18
glucose readings on the GlucoLab™ and ONETOUCH ULTRA, as well as alternate
site glucose testing on the forearm, palm, upper arm, thigh and calf using both the
GlucoLab™, and ONETOUCH ULTRA meters. No effort was made to determine
whether patients were in the steady state or had rapidly changing blood glucose
concentrations.
The readings were taken as close in time as possible. Within 5 minutes, a venous
whole blood sample was drawn and centrifuged for making serum. The serum sample
was tested by Hitachi 747. The sponsor indicated that during the comparison studies,
alternate sites were vigorously rubbed by the lay user and trained technician before
testing, and in some cases a warming pad was used.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a and b are not applicable):
The accuracy of the GlucoLab™ System was assessed by comparing blood glucose
results obtained by patients with those obtained using the Hitachi 747, a laboratory
instrument. Glucose levels were measured on 410 fresh capillary blood specimens by
104 diabetic patients and three healthcare professionals at three different clinical
centers.
The correlation between Hitachi 747 and GlucoLab™ were confirmed in the blood
samples with correlation coefficients of R=0.9840 (healthcare professionals) and
R=0.9830 (lay users) (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 respectively). Results indicate that the use of
the GlucoLab™ generate results similar to the Hitachi 747.
