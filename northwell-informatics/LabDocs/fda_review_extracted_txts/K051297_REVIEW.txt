CLSI Document EP5-A, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry
Devices
L. Test Principle:
The Elecsys N-MID Osteocalcin Assay is a two step sandwich immunoassay with
streptavidin microparticles and electrochemiluminescence detection. Results are
determined using a calibration curve that is generated specifically on each instrument
by a 2 point calibration and a master curve provided with the reagent bar code.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was determined using Elecsys reagents on the Elecsys® 2010
Immunoassay Analyzer, pooled human sera, and controls in a modified CLSI
replication experiment. Six replicates of each control or sample (pooled
human sera) were tested per day for 10 days. Within-run and total precision
were calculated according to EP5-A.
The mean values for the three sera were 15.5 ng/mL, 13.7 ng/mL, and 68.3
ng/mL. The mean values for the three controls were 21.9 ng/mL, 105.7
ng/mL, and 205.5 ng/mL. The within-run precision yielded CVs ranging from
1.2% to 4.0%. The total precision yielded CVs ranging from 1.7% to 6.5%.
Precision was also determined using the Elecsys E170 analyzer. The mean
values for the sera were 6.95 ng/mL, 24.8 ng/mL, and 76.4 ng/mL. The mean
values for the controls were 22.2 ng/mL, 94.9 ng/mL, and 196 ng/mL. The
within-run precision (n=21) yielded CVs ranging from 0.5% to 1.1%. The
total precision yielded CVs ranging from 1.1% to 1.6%.
Precision data on Elecsys 1010 are maintained on file at Roche.

The linearity of the Elecsys® N-MID Osteocalcin Assay was evaluated on the
Elecsys® 2010 Immunoassay Analyzer by diluting three patient samples with
varying amounts of the Elecsys® Universal Diluent.
The expected values were generated using the concentrations measured in the
diluent and the undiluted sample and then applying the dilution factors. The
percent recovery was determined by dividing the measured concentration with
the expected concentration. Three serum samples (34.1 ng/mL, 135 ng/mL,
and 211.7 ng/mL) yielded recoveries ranging from 91.3% to 102.1%.
Two additional dilution studies were performed to support linearity between
212 and 300 ng/mL, the upper limit of the measuring range. The 265.6 ng/mL
and 277.4 ng/mL samples yielded recoveries ranging from 91.8% to 105.3%.
To assess hook effect, a sample was spiked with osteocalcin to a concentration
of 4200 ng/mL diluted using Elecsys® Universal Diluent, and tested. No
high-dose hook effect was observed.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Elecsys Osteocalcin assay has been standardized against in-house
reference standards: osteocalcin in analyte-free human serum matrix.
The CalSet and CalCheck were prepared exclusively from the blood of donors
tested individually and shown by FDA-approved methods to be free from
HBsAg and antibodies to HCV and HIV.
Values are assigned using four Elecsys® MODULAR ANALYTICS E170
Immunoassay Analyzers, four Elecsys® 2010 Immunoassay Analyzers, and
four Elecsys® 1010 Immunoassay Analyzers. Two independent series of
analyses are performed on each instrument. Two-fold determinations are
made for each sample. The target value is then calculated as the median of the
determined values.
Accelerated stability data (35ºC for 3 weeks) and reconstituted stability data
were provided to support insert claims for Osteocalcin CalSet. The
acceptance criterion for each study was based on signal recovery of 95-105%
of the reference value.
Accelerated stability data (35ºC for 3 weeks) and reconstituted stability data
were also provided to support insert claims for Osteocalcin CalCheck. The
acceptance criterion for each study was recovery of 90-110% of the reference
value.
d. Detection limit:
6

--- Page 7 ---
The lower detection limit of the Elecsys® N-MID Osteocalcin Assay (0.500
ng/mL) was determined on the Elecsys® 2010 Immunoassay Analyzer by
calculating the concentration of osteocalcin that would give a response equal
to the mean of the Osteocalcin Master Low calibrator plus two standard
deviations. Three runs of twenty-one replicates each of the low calibrator
were performed. The calculated mean LDL for the three runs was 0.21
ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
To evaluate potential assay interference from endogenous substances, three
samples spiked with different amounts of an interferent (one interferent per
sample) were evaluated. Also, each of three samples with high rheumatoid
factor concentrations were diluted with one human sample and evaluated.
No interference (based on acceptable recoveries) was observed for the
following substances: biotin up to 100 ng/mL (osteocalcin 73.89 ng/mL),
lipids up to 1500 mg/dL (osteocalcin 27.3 ng/mL), bilirubin up to 65 mg/dL
(osteocalcin 39 ng/mL), and rheumatoid factor up to 2200 IU/mL (osteocalcin
20.0-252.1 ng/mL).
Various pharmaceutical compounds were spiked into a sample with
osteocalcin concentration of approximately 50 ng/mL and tested by the
Elecsys® N-MID Osteocalcin on the Elecsys® 2010 Immunoassay Analyzer.
Each of the compounds were found to be non-interfering.
The specificity of the Elecsys® N-MID Osteocalcin Assay was determined on
the Elecsys® 2010 Immunoassay Analyzer using samples spiked with
potential cross-reactant compounds. No cross-reactivity was observed with β-
Cross Laps at 15000 ng/mL and bone alkaline phosphatase at 140 U/L.
Parathyroid hormone at 3918 pg/mL exhibited 5.4% cross-reactivity.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A comparison of Elecsys® N-MID Osteocalcin with a commercially available
N-MID Osteocalcin test using 48 clinical samples (from 39 postmenopausal
women and 9 men) gave the following correlations (ng/mL): y = 1.307x + 2.0,
r = 0.966, md(68) = 0.816. Sample concentrations ranged between
approximately 2.58 and 49.79 ng/mL.

b. Matrix comparison:
Twenty-five samples each drawn into serum, K -EDTA, and Li-Heparin
3
plasma vacutainer tubes were compared to determine potential effects.
Passing/Bablok and Least Squares were calculated, and the method
comparison was found to be acceptable. Both the EDTA and heparin samples,
when compared to serum, yielded slopes between 0.9-1.1.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Elecsys® N-MID Osteocalcin (run on the Elecsys 2010) and a commercially
available N-MID Osteocalcin were used to measure retrospective samples
from 57 postmenopausal subjects participating in a clinical study involving
two Calcitonin treatments over six months. Samples were taken from patients
at weeks 0, 4, 12, and 24, yielding a total of 228 samples measured.
Sample concentrations ranged between approximately 9.19 and 93.38 ng/mL
on the subject device. Passing/Bablok linear regression results were as
follows: y = 1.120x + 4.4, r = 0.922, md(68) = 1.337.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The reference ranges are test-dependent. Completed studies with Elecsys N-MID
Osteocalcin have revealed the following ranges in ng/mL:
