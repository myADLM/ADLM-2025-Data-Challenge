H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
For use with MicroScan® Synergies plus™ Panels read on the WalkAway® -SI
System ( including upgraded WalkAway® -40 or WalkAway® -96 to meet
WalkAway® SI equivalence). MicroScan® panels are designed for use in
determining quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility
and/or identification to the species level of colonies, grown on solid media, of
rapidly growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-positive cocci and
Listeria.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The testing of levofloxacin at concentrations of 0.03 – 16 µg/mL to the gram-
positive test panel for testing Enterococcus and Staphylococcus at 4.5-16 hours
or 16-20 hours for a overnight reading.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
• Turbidity method of inoculum preparation only
• For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
Each panel contains two control wells: a negative control well, and a growth control
well (contains test medium without antibiotic). Antibiotics are diluted in water,
buffer, or minute concentrations of broth to selected concentrations prior to
dehydration of the panels. The panel is rehydrated and inoculated at the same time
with 0.1 ml of suspension prepared by the turbidity method (inoculum prepared in
0.4% saline with PLURONIC®, then 0.1ml transferred to 25ml of inoculum
Synergies plus Pos Broth with PLURONIC®) for a final inoculum concentration of
3-7 X 105 CFU/ml. Panels are incubated in a Walk-Away® System and read
periodically starting at 4.5 hours until sufficient growth to determine the MIC.
Alternately the panels may be incubated at 35o C in a non-CO for 16-20 hours and

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) M7 (M100-S15) “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
The WalkAway® SI uses a Colorimetric Optics System consisting of a color
wheel/lamp assembly and a Photosensor. There is an initial read at 2.5 hours with a
possible final read at 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 8, 12, 16, or 18 hours (overnight instrument
readings, manual readings) depending on the growth rate of the organism being
tested. The time of final read is dependent on the growth rate of the organism and
the sensitivity of the automatic reader since cell densities below 2 x 107 cells/ml are
not detected.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates tested at 3 sites on 3
separate days in triplicate. The study included the testing on the WalkAway®
SI read at <16 hours, WalkAway® 16-18 hour readings and manual readings
at 16-20 hours incubation. The WalkAway® SI had 10 results that were not
readable at <16 hours. All results were >95% reproducible. Although
reproducible results were obtained with all methods of reading the <16 hour
readings produced a slight trend for a more susceptible result if only by one
dilution.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC isolate was tested a sufficient number of times with
acceptable results on all testing days with the reference method. There
were no QC results that did not provide a result in the 4.5-16 hour
window. Quality control results demonstrated the ability of the different
reading parameters (manual and instrument) to produce acceptable results.
The following table provides the frequency of the results in each
concentration tested with the expected range stated.

There is a tendency of the <16 hours results to be one dilution more
susceptible but still be in the acceptable range. This was observed in the
reproducibility data as well.

previous testing of each isolate multiple times in the recommended reference
panel. The Synergies plus™ readings were obtained at times between 4.5 and 16
hours of incubation for >95% of the results. An additional comparison was done
with readings on the instrument after overnight incubation and also read manually
when incubated 16 - 18 hours. Performance by these alternate reading methods
was also acceptable with no apparent differences or trends. The recommended
CLSI reference method was followed with the exception of the use of a small
amount (0.1%) of Pluronic in the final inoculum. A validation of the use of
Pluronic in the frozen reference panels was conducted. Similar calculations for
the different reading methods were performed with very little difference. QC was
also performed with no difference apparent in the results.
The chart below demonstrates the performance of all three reading methods
(Synergies plus™ readings at <16 hours, overnight on the WalkAway® and
manually read at 18 hours using the touchScan®-SR) when compared to the
reference method.

Evaluable results are those that fall within the test range of the reference
method and could also be on-scale with the new device if within the
plus/minus one dilution variability. EA is when there is agreement
between the reference method and the MicroScan® within plus or minus
one serial two-fold dilution of antibiotic. CA is when the interpretation of
the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the
MicroScan® result.
