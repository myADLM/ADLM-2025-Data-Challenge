L. Test Principle:
The AxSYM B12 is a two-step microparticle enzyme intrinsic factor based on
microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA) technology. Sample and reagents
required for one test are pipetted into various wells of a reaction vessel (RV).
Extractant 1 and extractant 2 are combined in one RV well. Sample, denaturant, and a
portion of the extractant mixture are combined in another RV well. The RV is
immediately transferred into the processing center. Anti-intrinsic factor antibody
complexed with intrinsic factor coated microparticles is added to the reaction mixture.
B12 present in the sample bind to the intrinsic factor coated microparticles forming a
B12-intrinsic factor-microparticle complex. An aliquot of the reaction mixture is
transferred to the matrix cell. The microparticles bind irreversibly to a glass fiber
matrix. The matrix cell is washed to remove materials not bound to the microparticles.
The B12:alkaline phosphate conjugate is dispensed onto the matrix cell forming a
B12-intrinsic factor-microparticle-conjugate complex. The matrix cell is washed to
remove the unbound conjugate. The substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate is
added to the matrix cell and the fluorescent product is measured by the MEIA optical
assembly.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated as described in NCCLS EP-5A. Three B12 control
levels-low, medium, and high-were assayed in replicates of two at two
separate times of day for 20 days (n = 80). The targeted B12 concentration for
the low control is 200, for the medium control is 424 and for the high control
is 881. The results of the study are:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A study was conducted to evaluate the capability of the assay to recover
known concentrations of spiked B12 using ten human serum specimens
supplemented with known amounts of cyanocobalamin. Control samples were
prepared by supplementing with an equivalent volume of the diluent used to
prepare the B12 stock solution. The mean B12 concentration was calculated
for each set of four replicates. The difference between the means of each test
sample and its corresponding control sample was calculated. The percent
recovery was calculated using the following equation:
% Recovery = Difference _____ x 100
Concentration of B12 added
Where Difference = Test mean B12 concentration - Control mean concentration
The results are summarized in the following table:

A study was conducted to evaluate the capability of AxSYM B12 assay to
measure linearly diluted specimens containing B12 concentrations greater than
1200 pg/mL. Three human serum specimens with known B12 concentrations
were spiked with a 100,000 pg/mL B12 stock solution to yield a target B12
concentration of approximately 4800 pg/mL. Each spiked specimen was then
serially diluted with the diluent (Calibrator A) at 1:4, 1:8, and 1:16. Each sample
was tested in replicates of two and the mean B12 concentration was calculated for
each sample dilution. The percent recovery was calculated for each dilution using
the following equation:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (controls, calibrators, or method):
The on board reagent stability was performed using one reagent kit lot. The
time points were approximately 24 hours after the calibration run and at
approximately 8 and/or 16 hour increments thereafter. One run was performed
at each time point. A run consisted of two replicates each of the low, medium,
and high controls. The stability of the reagent kit while stored on board the
AxSYM system was determined to be 224 cumulative hours.
The stability of the reformulated microparticles was tested with the existing
reagent components (denaturant, extractant 1, extractant 2, conjugate). Three
kits of microparticles were evaluated at 2-8ºC, under onboard storage
conditions, and freeze/thaw. The stability performance was determined by
performing analysis on two lots of calibrators and controls at time points up to
12 months. The reagent pack includes the conjugate, denaturant, extractant 1
and extractant 2. The dating is determined by the component with the shortest
stable period in the reagent pack (the denaturant) which has 6 months of
stability. Therefore, the reagent pack is stable for 6 months when stored at 2-
8ºC.
NOTE: The calibrators and controls were cleared with the original 510(k) for
this device, k965186.

d. Detection limit
Analytical sensitivity, defined as 2 standard deviations above the
concentration of Calibrator A (0 pg/mL), was calculated to be 58 pg/mL at the
95th percentile. This is below the reportable range of the assay.
e. Analytical specificity:
The specificity of the assay was determined by studying the cross-
reactivity with cobinamide. A study was performed based on NCCLS
EP-7A. Normal serum specimens were supplemented with 9000 pg/mL
cobinamide. The mean observed cross-reactivity was 0.1%.
The assay has a mean potential interference from bilirubin, hemoglobin, red blood
cells, and triglycerides of ≤ 10% at the following levels as confirmed by a study
based on NCCLS EP-7A.
• Bilirubin ≤ 20 mg/dL
• Hemoglobin ≤ 500 mg/dL
• RBCs ≤ 0.4% (v/v)
• Triglycerides ≤ 1000 mg/dL
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The assay was compared to the predicate assay using a study based on NCCLS
EP-A2. The sample ranges for the 441 specimens in the study were as follows:
AxSYM (73.8 - 1177.0 pg/mL) and predicate (77 - 1210 pg/mL). Specimens
were tested once with two reagent lots on two instruments. Data was generated
using Least Squares and Passing-Bablok analyses. The results are as follows:
Regression Method n Intercept Slope
Least Squares 441 3.7 1.09
Passing-Bablok 441 -13.9 1.12
Correlation coefficient was 0.98
b. Matrix comparison:
A study was conducted to compare the results of human specimens collected
in different serum (glass, plastic, and serum separator tubes) and plasma
collection tubes (lithium heparin, lithium heparin plasma separator tubes,
sodium heparin and dipotassium EDTA). Matched draws of specimens were
obtained from 19 donors. A separate study matched draws of specimens
obtained from 20 donors in glass serum with no additive (control) and plastic
SST with clot activator. The following specimen collection tubes may be used
for the assay:

Specimen Storage: A study was conducted to compare the performance of
specimens stored under various conditions to their performance when the
specimens were freshly collected. For serum and plasma specimens removed
from cells, clot or separator gel and stored at 15-30ºC for 24 hours, the grand
mean % difference for all tube types ranged from -1.8% to 3.7%. For serum
and plasma specimens removed from the cells, clot or separator gel and stored
at 2-8ºC for 10 days, the grand mean % difference values for all tube types
ranged from -2.8% to 6.2%. The sponsor states that specimen performance is
acceptable when serum and plasma specimens are removed from the cells, clot
or separator gel or cells and stored at 15-30ºC for up to 24 hours before testing
or stored up to 10 days at 2-8 ºC.

The sponsor recommends that each laboratory establish its own reference ranges.
B12 Indeterminates
The sponsor states in the labeling that levels above 300 or 400 pg/mL are rarely
associated with B12 deficiency induced hematological or neurological diseases
respectively. Further testing for folic acid, intrinsic factor blocking antibodies,
homocysteine and/or methylmalonic acid is suggested in the labeling for
symptomatic patients with the following B12 levels:
Hematologic abnormalities 100-300 pg/mL
Neurologic abnormalities 100-400 pg/mL

N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
