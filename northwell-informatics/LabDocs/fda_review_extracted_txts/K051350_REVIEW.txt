H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
For use with MicroScan® Synergies plus™ Panels read on the WalkAway® -SI
System ( including upgraded WalkAway® -40 or WalkAway® -96 to meet
WalkAway® SI equivalence). MicroScan® panels are designed for use in
determining quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility
and/or identification to the species level of colonies, grown on solid media, of
rapidly growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-positive cocci and
Listeria.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The testing of Staphylococcus spp. with Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole at
concentrations between 0.5/9.5 to 8/152 µg/mL on the gram-positive test panel for
testing at 4.5-16 hours or 16-20 hours for an overnight reading.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
• Turbidity method of inoculum preparation only.
• For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
Each panel contains two control wells: a negative control well, and a growth control
well (contains test medium without antibiotic). Antibiotics are diluted in water,
buffer, or minute concentrations of broth to selected concentrations prior to
dehydration of the panels. The panel is rehydrated and inoculated at the same time
with 0.1 ml of suspension prepared by the turbidity method (inoculum prepared in
0.4% saline with PLURONIC®, then 0.1ml transferred to 25ml of inoculum
Synergies plus Pos Broth with PLURONIC®) for a final inoculum concentration of
3-7 X 105 CFU/ml. Panels are incubated in a Walk-Away® System and read
periodically starting at 4.5 hours until sufficient growth to determine the MIC.
Alternately the panels may be incubated at 35o C in a non-CO for 16-20 hours and
2
read by visual observation of growth.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) M7 (M100-S15) “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
The WalkAway® SI uses a Colorimetric Optics System consisting of a color
wheel/lamp assembly and a Photosensor. There is an initial read at 2.5 hours with a
possible final read at 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 8, 12, 16, or 18 hours (overnight instrument
readings, manual readings) depending on the growth rate of the organism being
tested. The time of final read is dependent on the growth rate of the organism and
the sensitivity of the automatic reader since cell densities below 2 x 107 cells/ml are
not detected.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates tested at 3 sites on 3
separate days in triplicate. The study included the testing on the WalkAway®
SI read at <16 hours, WalkAway® 16-18 hour readings and manual readings
at 16-20 hours incubation. The WalkAway® SI had 2 results that were not
readable at <16 hours. All results were >95% reproducible. Although
reproducible results were obtained with all methods of reading the <16 hour
readings produced a trend for a more susceptible result but with acceptable
performance.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended Quality Control isolates were tested a sufficient number of
times with acceptable results on all testing days with the reference method.
All results were obtained in the 4.5-16 hour window when read using the <16
hour reading requirements. Quality control results demonstrated the ability of
the different reading parameters (manual and instrument) to produce
acceptable results. The following provides the frequency of the results in
each concentration tested with the expected range stated.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical testing was conducted at three sites using fresh isolates supplemented
with stock isolates. A total of 376 gram-positive isolates were tested of which
263 were fresh isolates. There were 75 challenge isolates tested at one site and
compared to the reference broth dilution result mode that was determined by
previous testing of each isolate multiple times in the recommended reference
panel. The Synergies plus™ readings were obtained at times between 4.5 and 16
hours of incubation for >95% of the results. An additional comparison was done
with readings on the instrument after overnight incubation and also read manually
when incubated 16 - 18 hours. Performance by these alternate reading methods

was also acceptable with little differences except for a slight trend for the <16
hour readings to be slightly more susceptible. The recommended CLSI reference
method was followed with the exception of the use of a small amount (0.1%) of
Pluronic in the final inoculum. A validation of the use of Pluronic in the frozen
reference panels was conducted, demonstrating little or no difference.
The chart below demonstrates the performance of all three reading methods
(Synergies plus™ readings at <16 hours, overnight on the WalkAway® and
manually read at 18 hours using the touchScan®-SR) when compared to the
reference method. For the <16 hour read results, all of the major and very major
errors except for one were within EA. Since there is no intermediate range the
category error will either be a major or a very major error. Considering the error
of the reference method and test (both with a +/- one dilution) these would be
acceptable.

Evaluable results are those that fall within the test range of the reference
method and could also be on-scale with the new device if within the
plus/minus one dilution variability. EA is when there is agreement
between the reference method and the MicroScan® within plus or minus
one serial two-fold dilution of antibiotic. CA is when the interpretation of
the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the
MicroScan® result.
