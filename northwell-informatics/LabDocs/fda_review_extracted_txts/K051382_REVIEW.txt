K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced in this submission.
L. Test Principle:
The Elecsys® proBNP Immunoassay is an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay
(ECLIA). The test uses the sandwich principle. In the first incubation, antibody from
the sample, biotinylated polyclonal NT-proBNP-specific antibody and polyclonal
NT-proBNP-specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium complex form a sandwich
complex. In the second incubation, after addition of streptavidin labeled
microparticles, the complex produced is bound to the solid phase via biotin-
streptavidin interaction. The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell
where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode.
Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission
which is measured by a photomultiplier. Results are determined via a calibration
curve. This curve is instrument-specifically generated by a 2-point calibration and a
master curve provided via the reagent barcode.
