I. Device Description:
The SpotChem II Total Bilirubin, Total Protein and Albumin assays are in vitro
diagnostic procedures intended to measure Total Bilirubin, Total Protein and
Albumin quantitatively in human serum and plasma (whole blood) on the SpotChem
EZ Analyzer.
The device is composed of a plastic strip to which a multi-layered test field is affixed.
The layers consist of a sample-retention layer, a layer containing the reagent and a
support layer.
A fixed amount of serum or plasma is placed on the test field of the reagent strip. The
serum or plasma spreads in a uniform fashion across the entire surface of the sample
retention layer. The serum or plasma then permeates into the reagent layer where the
reaction is initiated.

L. Test Principle:
Both indirect and direct bilirubin in serum or plasma reacts with diazonium salt in the
presence of dyphylline and an acidic buffer to form a red azobilirubin as a final
product. During the reaction, the reagent layer is completely dissolved and absorbed
by the sample-retention layer. These two layers thus form a single detection layer.
The intensity of the red color at 550 nm by reflectance spectrophotometry is
proportional to the concentration of Total Bilirubin in the sample.
Protein in serum or plasma reacts with copper ion at high pH to form a blue-purple
color. During the reaction, the reagent layer is completely dissolved and is absorbed
by the sample-retention layer. These two layers thus form a single detection layer.
The intensity of the blue-purple color as measured at 550 nm by reflectance
spectrophotometry, is proportional to the concentration of Total Protein in the sample.
Albumin in serum or plasma is combined with bromcresol green (BCG) in acidic
conditions to form a blue-green complex. During the reaction, the reagent layer is
completely dissolved and is absorbed by the sample-retention layer. These two layers
thus form a single detection layer. The intensity of the blue-green color as measured
at 610 nm by reflectance spectrophotometry, is proportional to the concentration of
Albumin in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra-assay precision was assessed by three control samples. Twenty replicates
of each sample within one run. Acceptance criteria is a CV of <5%. Inter-
assay precision was assessed by assaying three control samples in duplicate in
ten runs over five days. Acceptance criteria is a CV<10%. The results are
presented in the tables below:

Intra assay precision was assessed using a whole blood sample. Ten replicates
of the same sample within one run. Acceptance criteria is a CV of <5%. The
results are presented in the table below:
Analyzer SpotChem Mean SD % CV
Total Bilrubin 4.09 0.166 4.1%
Total Protein 8.92 0.326 3.7%
Albumin 5.37 0.263 4.9%
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity was assessed by assaying serial dilutions. The linearity claim is
based on a percent deviation of < 5% at the two highest analyte
concentrations. The results obtained were as follows: Total Bilirubin up to
16.4 mg/dL, Total Protein up to 10.7 g/dL and Albumin up to 6.6 g/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibration set points are fixed by the manufacturer and are unique with
each reagent lot and stored on the magnetic card provided with each kit lot.
The principle of the calibration is to fix a two-point calibration curve for a
given lot into the memory of the instrument. The sample absorbances are then
read off this fixed curve by the instrument and the concentration is calculated
and the results are provided by the software.
The magnetic card has values of the basic calibration curve (Cal-Low (a) and
Cal-High (b)) and its own measured value (Cal-Low (A) and Cal-High (B)).

During calibration, the SpotChem EZ reads these 4 values from magnetic
card, and calculates the calibration to be A->a, B->b. To assign A and B:
average on n=18 tests x High (for B) and Low (for A) in each lot with
Calibrator (A and B indicated value of calibrator).
The value of the calibrator is assigned by the manufacturer by assessing the
mean value of 3 lots x n=6 x 5 days x 2 instruments x High (for b) and Low
(for a).
Control values are determined using previously cleared control material
(k942458). The value assignment protocol is as follows: a minimum of five
vials of each control level is required for value assignment. One vial is
required for each day and will be tested on three different instruments to
produce a minimum of 10 replicates on each instrument. Each instrument will
be calibrated each testing day for five testing days.
d. Detection limit:
Functional sensitivity was assessed by diluting a pool to 10 different
concentrations below the lower limit of the analyte range. Each dilution was
assayed in replicates of ten. The mean, standard deviation and percent
coefficient of variation were calculated for the ten replicates of each dilution.
The functional sensitivity of the test was defined at the value of the dilution
where the CV is approximately 20% (taking into consideration that the actual
mean was within +10% of the expected target). It was determined that
functional sensitivity was 0.3 mg/dL with a CV of 0.0% for Total Bilirubin,
2.7 g/dL with a CV of 2.5% for Total Protein and 0.6 g/dL with a CV of 0.0%
for Albumin.
e. Analytical specificity:
Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could
interfere with the method. A summary of the data for know interferents
appears for the common interferents in the table below:
Total Bilirubin Total Protein Albumin
Sample Highest Level Tested Highest Level Tested Highest Level Tested
