H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use
2. Indication(s) for use:
The i-STAT CK-MB test is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative
measurement of creatine kinase MB mass in whole blood or plasma samples.
CK-MB measurements can be used as an aid in the diagnosis of myocardial
infarction (MI), re-infarction, and the sizing of infarction. CK-MB measurements
can also be used in monitoring reperfusion during thrombolytic therapy and
perioperative myocardial infarction (poMI) after cardiac surgery.
The i-STAT Cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) test is an in vitro diagnostic test for the
quantitative measurement of cardiac troponin I in whole blood or plasma.
Measurements of cardiac Troponin I are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
myocardial infarction and as an aid in the risk stratification of patients with acute
coronary syndromes with respect to their relative risk of mortality.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
for prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
i-STAT 1 Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The i-STAT CK-MB and cTnI tests are contained in single cartridges. In use, the user
scans a bar-code and then places approximately 16 microliters of fresh whole blood in
the cartridge. The cartridge is inserted into the thermally controlled i-STAT
Analyzer, and all analytical steps are performed automatically. Patient and user
information may be entered into the analyzer via a keypad during the automated
analysis cycle. The CK-MB and cTnI test cartridges are assembled from plastic
components that provide the conduits for fluid handling and house the sensor chips
and heating elements necessary for temperature control and signal measurement.
Upon insertion of the cartridge into the analyzer, it performs several quality checks.
The sample and enzyme-linked antibody conjugate are incubated for a predetermined
period of time under temperature control. The sample is discarded and the
substrate/wash solution is brought over the alkaline phosphatase captured on the
CK-MB or cTnI sensor. The enzyme cleaves the substrate giving rise to an
amperometric signal which the analyzer measures. The result is displayed and stored
in memory for possible transfer via infra red to a printer or to electronic databases.

L. Test Principle:
Thei-STAT CK-MB test is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with
amperometric detection of the alkaline phosphatase enzyme signal, similar in
principle to the i-STAT cTnI cartridge.
Antibodies specific to an epitope unique to the MB subunit, that therefore do not bind
to CK-MM nor CK-BB, are patterned on the gold sensor via partial drop
microprinitng of a carboxylated polystyrene latex microsphere suspension. The
CK-MB capture antibodies are covalently bound to the microspheres prior to their
deposition on the spheres. The gold sensor is situated on a silicon chip positioned in
the microfluidic channel of the cartridge.
An alkaline phosphatase-CK-BB Fab conjugate is also printed on the silicon chip.
This conjugate is formulated with antibody fragments that are specific to an epitope
on the B subunit of creatine kinase, in a matrix of materials which aid in the
stabilization of enzyme conjugate and aid in decreasing immunological interferences
during the CK-MB assay. The specificity of the conjugate antibody to the B subunit
allows this conjugate to recognize CK-MB and CK-BB but not CK-MM.
i-STAT cTnI Two Site Elisa. The analyte, cardiac Troponin I is captured by a probe
impregnated with a monoclonal anti-cTnI antibody. The sample is discarded. The
probe is treated with a second reagent composed of anti-cTnI polyclonal antibodies
which are tagged with Alkaline Phosphatase. After washing, the sandwich complex is
treated with a substrate which upon being cleaved by the captured alkaline
phosphatase produces and electronic signal which is read by the i-STAT analyzer.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
i-STAT Cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) - subject of k031739 except for matrix studies below
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
An imprecision study involving twenty test events, three lots of i-STAT CK-
MB test cartridges, seven i-STAT 1 analyzers and a single lot of control fluids
was performed by hospital personnel at the clinical site. A second
imprecision study was performed at i-STAT Canada Limited, Ottawa, by
i-STAT personnel. Six different i-STAT 1 analyzers and the same cardiac
marker control fluid lot were used in this study. In each event of these
precision studies, different vials of three levels of controls were run in
duplicate in each of three sub-lots of i-STAT CK-MB test cartridges. The
hospital imprecision data was collected over a 23-day period while the study
at i-STAT ran for 20 days.

--- Page 4 ---
The results of these studies are summarized below. The arithmetic mean of
the total imprecision across all studies/sites is 10.5%, 10.4%, and 9.9% for
level 1, 2 and 3 controls respectively.

An important property of a CK-MB assay is its selectivity for the MB
isoform of the creatine kinase enzyme. To demonstrate this selectivity, a
plasma sample containing a low CK-MB level was measured pairwise
using three different lots of CK-MB assay cartridges in the presence and
absence of the other major isoforms of the CK enzyme.

O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Single use cartridge
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Bar code reader is incorporated into the system.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Whole blood samples are applied directly into the sample well of the cartridge.
5. Calibration:
Factory set
6. Quality Control:
Quality control is material available. The reliability of the result is maintained
through a combination of user testing and instrument self-checks. The self-checks
occur with every cartridge run and verify performance of the analyzer and
cartridge sub-systems. This includes checks on the individual sensor’s
performance, the integrity of the calibrant fluid, the response of the pressure and
thermal transducers, and the flow of calibrant and sample within the cartridge.
Any values that are statistically deviant from the factory-established expectation
values would cause the test results to be suppressed.
