L. Test Principle:
The eSensor® CFCD System uses a solid-phase electrochemical method for determining the
carrier status of a defined panel of CF mutations. Purified genomic DNA is isolated from the
patient specimen according to defined laboratory procedures. The CFCD System generates
single stranded target DNA from the genomic DNA by multiplex PCR amplification
followed by exonuclease digestion. This specimen is combined with allele-specific (wild
type and mutant) oligonucleotide signal probes, each labeled with a different ferrocene
derivative, and loaded on a cartridge containing single-stranded capture probes bound to
gold-plated electrodes. The cartridge is inserted into the 4800 Instrument where the single
stranded targets hybridize to the complementary sequences of the capture probes and signal
probes. Each mutation’s carrier status is determined by voltammetry, which generates
specific electrical signals from the wild type and mutant signal probes.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Two reproducibility studies were performed. The Clinical trial reproducibility study
used banked and prospectively collected patient samples and the Supplemental
reproducibility study used cell lines.

Supplemental reproducibility study - Twenty genomic DNA samples derived from
cell lines carrying one or two of each of the 23 mutations detectable by the eSensor®
CFCD System, and one non-carrier control cell line genomic DNA sample were
tested. All samples were subjected to DNA sequencing to confirm the expected
genotypes. Reproducibility testing was performed at three sites (including 2 external
sites) with three manufacturing lots of eSensor® CFCD Assay Kits and three
instruments in 5 independent runs per site per lot. Eighty-one samples (7.8%) gave
an initial no-call result, but upon retesting, 79 of these gave the expected result. One
sample gave an incorrect call (carrier instead of non-carrier) for the R553X mutation,
and one sample did not give a result.

Sponsor repeated the No-call samples and provided the additional testing information.
After repeat testing of no-call samples, the agreement between the eSensor assay and
bi-directional sequencing for all mutations was between 99.9% to 100%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The reference method is bi-directional sequencing.
Assay Controls: The assay contains positive and negative controls to assure proper
test results.
Positive Control: Each cartridge contains a capture probe that is complementary to a
synthetic target DNA present in the hybridization mixture. The target is in turn
complementary to a control signal probe in the hybridization mixture, and thus
generates an appropriate signal in the assay. The positive control is designed to
detect a systematic failure of the hybridization and/or detection processes, or any
failure to meet the required A or B combination of signal buffer, cartridge, and/or
scanning protocol. A lack of signal for the positive control indicates a genotyping
assay failure. If a correct signal is observed for the positive control, but one or more
genotyping assays are invalid due to low signals, then a failure of DNA isolation,
PCR amplification, or exonuclease digestion is indicated. The positive control signal
probes for the set A and B cartridges contain different ferrocene labels, so an
incorrect genotyping score for the positive control indicates that the set A assay
mixture was added to a set B cartridge or vice-versa.

Negative Control: A negative control is present on each cartridge, consisting of a
capture probe that does not hybridize to any sequence within the target DNA or signal
probes. A positive signal on the negative control indicates an assay system failure.
The locations of the negative and positive control electrodes are swapped in the A and
B cartridges, so a signal on the negative control electrode and no signal on the
positive control electrode of the same cartridge indicates the A cartridges were
scanned with the B protocol and/or vice versa.
Stability: Stability studies support a shelf life of 6 months for cartridges (stored at 10
to 25°C), PCR reagents and genotyping reagents (stored at -20°C).
d. Detection limit:
The package insert recommends that the concentration of genomic DNA should be at
least 1.7 ng/µL (10 ng/PCR) and no more than 100 ng/µL (600 ng/PCR). Samples
containing up to 1,200 ng DNA/PCR has been tested and has found to give accurate
results in the CFCD system as compared to DNA sequencing.
e. Analytical specificity:
The following interfering substances were added separately to whole blood at the
concentrations indicated, and no effect was observed on yield of extracted DNA,
multiplex amplification of CFTR gene sequences, or genotyping of mutations in the
CF carrier screening panel: triglycerides (3,000 mg/dL), high-density lipoprotein (70
mg/dL), cholesterol (250 mg/dL), bile salts (a mixture of cholate and deoxycholate;
6.4 µg/mL), human albumin (3 g/dL), human IgG (3 g/dL), bilirubin (15 mg/dL),
acetaminophen (30 µg/mL), ascorbic acid (30 µg/mL), diphenylhydantoin (phenytoin;
20 µg/mL), gentamicin (12 µg/mL), N-acetylsalicylic acid (200 µg/mL), nicotine (100
µg/mL), theophylline (20 µg/mL), valproic acid (100 µg/mL), vancomycin (100
µg/mL), NaCl (150 mM), KCl (5 mM), CaCl (1.08 mM), FeCl (9.25 µM).

f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
In a clinical trial method comparison study, three external sites tested a total of 359
genomic DNA samples extracted from freshly-collected, prospective whole blood
specimens and 127 banked genomic DNA samples from clinical laboratories using
the eSensor® CFCD System and DNA Sequencing. Samples were retested only if
they gave a no-call result.
Per sample: Before retesting, the percent agreement of the eSensor® CFCD System
compared to sequencing was 96.3% (468/486). Following retesting of no-call
samples, the percent agreement increased to 98.6% (479/486). CFCD System
genotyping results were not obtained for 5 samples. For samples which gave a valid
genotyping result, the agreement of the eSensor® CFCD System compared to
sequencing was 99.6% (479/481). Two samples gave incorrect carrier calls by the
eSensor® CFCD System; one of these (call of 2184delA carrier) occurred in a sample
carrying the non-panel mutation 2183AA>G.
Per mutation: In the above method comparison studies, 11,178 (486 x 23) individual
mutations were analyzed. For all mutations, before retesting, the percent agreement
between the eSensor® CFCD System and DNA sequencing was 96.7%
(10,808/11,178). Following retesting no-call samples, the percent agreement
7

--- Page 8 ---
increased to 99.0% (11,061/11,178). Genotyping information was not obtained for
115 mutations (5 samples). For samples which gave a valid genotyping result, the
agreement between the eSensor® CFCD System and DNA sequencing was 99.98%
(11,061/11,063). Detailed mutation-by-mutation agreement results are provided in
Table 5 (before retesting) and Table 6 (after retesting no-call samples). No carrier
sample for mutation 2184delA was tested during the method comparison studies.
However, during the supplemental reproducibility study, genomic DNA from a cell
line heterozygous for the 2184delA mutation was tested in three laboratories using
three kit lots. All 45 assay replicates with this sample gave the correct genotypes for
all mutations.

N. Instrument Name:
eSensor® 4800 System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The eSensor® 4800 Instrument operates in a batch mode only. Sample ID’s and test
protocols can only be entered while the instrument is in the stand-by mode, and once a
run of up to 48 cartridges (24 cystic fibrosis tests) is begun, it cannot be interrupted
without invalidating the run.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes __√______ or No ________
The operator software is installed on an off-the-shelf Windows PC running Windows
2000. Access to the software is first controlled by secure Windows logon and then by
username/password identification in the operator software. The Windows account under
which the software runs is highly restricted and does not give the user an ability to install
or remove other Windows applications.
The operator software is a compiled graphical application written in the LabVIEW
programming language from National Instruments. The software communicates with the
instrument via RS-232 and RS-485 serial communications. The data collected from the
instrument is analyzed by the software and stored in a secure Oracle 8i database.
The system runs entirely stand-alone including the attached printer. The software allows
the user to export reports in an HTML or Tab-Delimited file format which can then be
transferred to a client LIMS (if any) using a USB memory drive. The software also
allows the user to export the data used to generate the reports.
3. Specimen Identification:
Specimens are identified by manual or bar-code entry of the sample ID during run set-up.
The sample ID is entered using a graphical user interface representing the layout of slots
(cartridge locations) on the instrument. Two slot locations, corresponding to one Set A
cartridge and one Set B cartridge, must be associated with one unique sample ID. The

software links the sample ID and the results from the two cartridges in the final report.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Genomic DNA is extracted from whole blood samples by the laboratory’s validated
method. The extracted DNA sample is the starting point for the eSensor CFCD System.
5. Calibration:
The instrument does not require calibration. Voltages and currents are determined versus
industry-standard internal fixed references produced by highly reliable components.
Quality control testing during instrument manufacture is performed to confirm that
measurement and control of temperature and electrical current are within specification:
The operator software allows the user to confirm the thermal and electrical performance
of the system at will:
• The thermal tests cycle all slots through their useful temperature range, and
confirm that they reach thermal equilibrium within defined time limits.
• The electrical test characterizes the electronics for its linearity at many different
frequencies and voltages spanning its operational capabilities. This test is first
run during manufacturing and results of this characterization are stored in the
instrument’s permanent memory. The user may then run the same test. If the
results of the user test agree with the permanently stored data, this indicates that
the electronics have not drifted from their original state since manufacturing.
In addition to the QC and user tests, the instrument performs functional self tests each
time it is turned on. These tests confirm that the thermal sensors are functional and
communicating, that the on-board memory is working, that the switching electronics is
functional and the embedded firmware is not corrupted. If any of the tests fail, the
corresponding elements are locked out from use by the operator software.
6. Quality Control:
The CFCD System has a number of built-in controls on every cartridge to assure proper
system function and test validity. In addition, the Product Insert requires that a nuclease-
free, deionized water sample be included in each PCR run, and the resulting product be
subjected to exonuclease digestion and genotyping by the CFCD System.
Routine testing of quality control samples should be performed as recommended by the
appropriate professional organizations. In the case of CF, approximately 96% of samples
will be non-carriers, and so an additional negative control is not necessary for use with
the CFCD System. Given the number of mutations in the CF panel, it is not practical to
run positive controls for every mutation. To address this issue, both the American
College of Medical Genetics and the College of American Pathologists have published
recommendations that a bank of samples containing individual mutations be obtained,
and that a single positive control be selected from the bank in rotation and tested with
each run.
