K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced
L. Test Principle:
This is an enzymatic, colorimetric two step assay. In the incubation step, the activity
of the human salivary α-amylase is inhibited by two different monoclonal antibodies
without affecting the pancreatic α-amylase. In the reaction step, defined
oligosaccharides such as 4, 6-ethylidene (G7)p-nitrophenyl-pNP (G1) α, D-
maltohepatoside (ethylidine-G PNP) are cleaved under the catalytic action of α-
7
pancreatic amylases. The G PNP, G PNP and G PNP fragments that are formed are
2 3 4
completely hydrolyzed to p-nitrophenol (pNP) and glucose by α-glucosidase. The
increase of absorbance due to pNP formation is proportional to the pancreatic α-
amylase activity in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra-assay precision on the Aeroset was assessed by assaying three control
samples twenty times in one run. Intra-assay precision on the c8000 was
assessed by assaying two control samples twenty times in one run. The
sponsor states the acceptance criterion for the precision studies is: CV <6%.

control in duplicate in 2 runs for 14 days.
Inter-Assay Precision was assessed on the c8000 by assaying two levels of
control in duplicate, one run, for 15 days.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity was assessed by testing serial dilutions. The High Standard was
prepared by adding a commercially marketed pure enzyme to an albumin
matrix. Eight amylase linearity solutions were prepared by quantitatively
diluting this stabilized stock standard. Linearity was assessed from duplicate
testing of these solutions on the Aeroset system. The sponsor’s studies show
that the assay is linear to 2200 IU/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor verifies the traceability of the assay using an internal standard.
The sponsor establishes the reagent shelf life by performing real-time
performance studies that support the 18 months stability claim.

The sponsor establishes reagent “on board” stability through real-time
measurement of five control materials that are tested in triplicate at time 0 and
30 days. The studies support the 30 day stability claim of the reagent “on
board” the analyzers.
d. Detection limit:
The sensitivity of the assay is 1 U/L. The sensitivity is determined on twenty
replicates of normal saline and represents the lowest pancreatic ά-amylase
activity that can be distinguished from zero. It is calculated as 3 SD of the
twenty replicates. The company also performed a precision study with a
sample value of approximately 1 U/L. The sample was run ten times and has a
%CV of 16.1%.
e. Analytical specificity:
Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could
interfere with the method. A summary is presented in the table below:
Compound Concentration-No

Bilirubin 40 mg/dL
Triglycerides 1500 mg/dL
f. Assay cut-off:
