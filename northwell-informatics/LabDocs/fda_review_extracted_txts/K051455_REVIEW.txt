The Wieslab™ Cap MPO ANCA test kit is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
for detection and semi-quantitation of IgG antibodies to myeloperoxidase (MPO) in human
serum. The wells of the microtiter plate strips are coated with a capture complex of
monoclonal antibody to myeloperoxidase and purified MPO antigen. Antibodies specific to
MPO in diluted serum bind to the capture antigen during the first incubation. The wells are
then washed to remove unbound antibodies. An enzyme labeled anti-human IgG conjugate is
added to bind the capture antigen- antibody complex in the well during the second incubation
step. After a further washing step, detection of the specific antibodies is obtained by
incubation with substrate solution. The amount of bound antibodies correlated to the color
intensity and is measured in terms of absorbance (optical density, OD). The absorbance is
then calculated against the calibrator curve and the results are given in arbitrary Units/mL.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The intra-assay reproducibility was determined by testing one sample 36 times and
six samples 24 times. Four samples with high anti-MPO concentrations (89-125
U/mL) had a CV of 2.6-8.0% and three samples close to the assay cut-off (29-44
U/mL) had a CV of 11-15%.
The inter-assay reproducibility was determined by testing seven samples in duplicate
for four times. Four samples with high anti-MPO concentrations (51-89 U/mL) had a
CV of 4-15%. Three samples close to the assay cut-off (18-35 U/mL) had a CV of 5-
15%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Three positive sera were diluted serially from neat, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16 and 1:32
dilutions. The values were compared to log 2 of dilution by standard regression. The
values indicate that the assay has a linear relationship with serum dilutions.
The assay reportable range is from 10-320 U/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no reference standard for anti-MPO. The calibrators and controls (positive
and negative) are prepared in-house and arbitrary units are assigned during the
development process.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference by endogenous substances: No data provided. The package insert states
to avoid sera which are icteric, lipemic, and hemolyzed; and heat-inactivated sera
should not be used.
Crossreactivity with heterophile antibodies: Since one of the capture antigen
component is a monoclonal antibody, some in-house interference studies (~12000
samples) were performed. The effect was determined to be very low (0.025%). The
package insert states that ‘individuals receiving mouse anti-human antibodies for
treatment or diagnosis, or those patients who have otherwise exposed to mouse
immunoglobulin, may produce Human Anti-Mouse Antibodies (HAMA). These
antibodies can interfere with assays using mouse monoclonal antibodies and may
cause falsely elevated levels’.

f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off value of >20 U/mL was based on testing 120 normal blood donor sera,
and 61 non-vasculitis disease samples (17 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) samples; 29
systemic lupus erythematous (SLE); 8 Ulcerative colitis; 3 Celiac disease; and 4
Crohn’s disease). All of the normal donors and non-vasculitis disease samples were
negative.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Testing was performed on 102 samples. The positive percent agreement was 97.0%
(32/33); the negative percent agreement was 97.0% (64/66) and the Overall
Agreement was 97.0% (96/99).

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical sensitivity and specificity:
The clinical sensitivity and specificity study were evaluated on 337 clinically
characterized sera from patients with the following diagnosis: 53 Microscopic
polyangiitis (MP); 52 WG (Wegener’s granulomatosis); 29 SLE; 17 RA; 51
Glomerular basement membrane (GBM); 8 Ulcerative colitis; 3 Celiac disease; 4
Crohn’s disease; and 120 healthy blood donors. Sensitivity for MP was 98.1%, which
was higher than the predicate device sensitivity of 66.6%. The overall specificity of
the new device (healthy and disease controls) was 91.8%.
