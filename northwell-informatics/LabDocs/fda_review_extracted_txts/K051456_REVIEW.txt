K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The determination of ceruloplasmin is based on the specific immunoturbidimetric
reaction which occurs between the anti-ceruloplasmin polyclonal antiserum and its
corresponding antigen under optimal pH conditions and in the presence of
polyethylene glycol (PEG). The turbidity of the immune complex is proportional to
the concentration of the analyte in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision on the AEROSET system (within-run, between-run and total), was
determined by analyzing three control levels in duplicate twice a day, over a
period of 10 days (n=40) using one reagent/calibrator lot and one operator.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed on an AEROSET® System using a serum
sample containing 120 mg/dL of Ceruloplasmin diluted in physiologic saline
at 6 different dilutions (10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%). Each dilution
was analyzed in quadruplicate. Data generated indicate acceptable linearity up
to 120 mg/dL, with a regression equation y = 1.2041x + 0.7786, r2 = 0.9995.
The claim for this assay is 2 to 110 mg/dL.

An additional linearity study was done on the ARCHITECT c8000 per the
reviewer’s request but due to the lack of a highly concentrated sample, a
serum sample with a concentration of 86 mg/dL was used. The spline
calibration method was used which would linearize the response in
absorbance of the reactive against the actual concentration. The serum sample
was diluted in physiologic saline at10 different dilutions (5%, 10%, 20%,
30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100%). Each dilution was
analyzed in triplicate. Median of the result was compared with the expected
calculated value. % recovery of the median result found against the expected
value must be within 10% (90-110%). The following results were obtained.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The traceability of the method is verified using CRM 470 (Certified Reference
Material) from BCR (EC Community Bureau of Reference) corresponding to
RPPHS (Reference Preparation for Protein in Human Serum) lot numbers
91/06 19. Once this lyophilized material is reconstituted, it is aliquoted and
stored frozen at -20 o C (master lot). The Sentinel Plasmaproteins Cal 3x value
assignment is assessed by testing a new lot of calibrator with a master lot. In
the assignment testing, five replicates per 3 runs are assessed for
ceruloplasmin assay. The assigned value is calculated as the average of all
replicates for the assay. Quality control materials are used to verify the assay
performance at every step of the test.
d. Detection limit:
Sensitivity was determined on the AEROSET and ARCHITECT c8000 from 6
serial dilutions (2.5%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 25%, and 50%) of a sample containing
26.44 mg/dL ceruloplasmin with normal saline. Each dilution was tested over
20 replicates for the AEROSET and 10 replicates for the ARCHITECT c8000.
For immunoturbidimetric methods, the sensitivity represents the lowest
measurable concentration of analyte that can be distinguished from the zero
standard. Results showed sensitivity to be less than 1.0 mg/dL for both
instruments. The claim for this assay is 2.0 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering substances
Interference testing was performed by spiking a sample containing
ceruloplasmin. For each interfering substance, the sample was split in two
aliquots, one spiked with a concentrated interfering substance and the other
5

with normal saline. Each dilution was assayed in triplicate. %Recovery of
spiked samples vs. non-spiked was calculated. An acceptance criterion is 100
± 10%. No significant interference was observed in:
• Bilirubin up to 30 mg/dL
• Hemoglobin up to 500 mg/dL
• Triglycerides up to 1000 mg/dL
• Rheumatoid Factor up to 70 IU/mL
