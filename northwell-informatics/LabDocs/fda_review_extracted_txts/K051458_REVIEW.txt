of the microtiter plate strips are coated with a capture complex of monoclonal antibody to
proteinase 3 and purified PR3 antigen. Antibodies specific to PR3 in diluted serum bind to the
capture antigen during the first incubation. The wells are then washed to remove unbound
antibodies. An enzyme labeled anti-human IgG conjugate is added to bind the capture antigen-
antibody complex in the well during the second incubation step. After a further washing step,
detection of the specific antibodies is obtained by incubation with substrate solution. The amount of
bound antibodies correlated to the color intensity and is measured in terms of absorbance (optical
density, OD). The absorbance is then calculated against the calibrator curve and the results are
given in arbitrary Units/mL.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The intra-assay reproducibility was determined by testing eight samples 24 times.
Five samples with high anti-PR3 concentrations (102-141 U/mL) had a CV of 6-9%
and three samples close to the assay cut-off (24-42 U/mL) had a CV of 3-13%.
The inter-assay reproducibility was determined by testing seven samples in duplicate
for four times. Three samples with high anti-PR3 concentrations (77-138 U/mL) had
a CV of 6-7%. Four samples close to the assay cut-off (23-49 U/mL) had a CV of 4-
14%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Three positive sera were diluted serially from neat, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16 and 1:32
dilutions. The values were compared to log 2 of dilution by standard regression. The
values indicate that the assay has a linear relationship with serum dilutions.
The assay reportable range is from 10-320 U/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no reference standard for anti-PR3. The calibrators and controls (positive
and negative) are prepared in-house and arbitrary units are assigned during the
development process.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference by endogenous substances: No data provided. The package insert states
to avoid sera which are icteric, lipemic, and hemolyzed; and heat-inactivated sera
should not be used.
Crossreactivity with heterophile antibodies: Since one of the capture antigen
component is a monoclonal antibody, some in-house interference studies (~12000
samples) were performed. The effect was determined to be very low (0.025%). The
package insert states that ‘individuals receiving mouse anti-human antibodies for
treatment or diagnosis, or those patients who have otherwise exposed to mouse
immunoglobulin, may produce Human Anti-Mouse Antibodies (HAMA). These
antibodies can interfere with assays using mouse monoclonal antibodies and may
cause falsely elevated levels’.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off value of >30 U/mL was based on testing 120 normal blood donor sera, 17
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) samples, 46 systemic lupus erythematous (SLE). All of the
3

--- Page 4 ---
normal donors were negative. One of the RA and one of the SLE samples were
equivocal (23 and 27 U/mL respectively).
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Testing was performed on 180 samples. The positive percent agreement was 97.6%
(40/41); the negative percent agreement was 98.5% (133/135) and the Overall
Agreement was 98.3% (173/176).

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical sensitivity and specificity:
The clinical sensitivity and specificity study were evaluated on 363 clinically
characterized sera from patients with the following diagnosis: 50 WG; 50
microscopic polyangiitis (MP); 45 SLE; 18 RA; 80 glomerular basement membrane
antibody (GBM); and 120 healthy blood donors. Sensitivity for WG was 97%.
Sensitivity for MP patients was 31.2% because PR3-ANCA antibodies are only found
in approximately one third of the MP patients. The overall specificity of the new
device (healthy and disease controls) was 97.3%.
