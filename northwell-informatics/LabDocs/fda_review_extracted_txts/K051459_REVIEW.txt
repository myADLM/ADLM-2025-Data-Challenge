510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
K051459
B. Purpose for Submission:
Extension of Mean Cell Volume (MCV) parameter stability to 48 hours
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Sysmex America, Inc., Sysmex XE-2100DC Automated Hematology Analyzer
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Quantitative, Mean Cell Volume (MCV)
E. System Descriptions:
1. Devise Description:
The Sysmex XE-2100DC is an automated hematology analyzer which can
analyze 21 parameters in whole blood. These parameters include: WBC, RBC,
HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW-CV, RDW-SD, PLT, MPV, and
NEUT%/#, LYMP %/#, MONO %/#, EO%/#, and BASO %/#.
The XE-2100DC system consists of four principle units and three printers, which
are: (1) Main unit, which analyzes and controls samples, (2) Sampler Unit, which
supplies samples to the Main Unit automatically, (3) Information Processing Unit
(IPU), which processes data which gets from the Main Unit, (4) Pneumatic Unit,
which supplies pressure and vacuum used by the Main Unit, (5) Color Graphic
Printer, which prints a hadcopy of analysis results for screen of histograms,
scattergrams, etc, (6) Data Printer, which prints analysis data in the examination
ticket format, and (7) Page Printer, which prints lists of analysis information or
results. Operator interface with the IPU is accomplished with the use of a 22-key
panel keyboard. The analyzer processes approximately 113 to 150 samples per
hour, depending on the mode used.
2. Principles of Operation:
The XE-2100DC performs hematology analyses using the following methods :
Sheath Flow DC Detection Method, Flow Cytometry Methods using a
Semiconductor Laser and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) hemoglobin Method.

WBCs, are analyzed by the opitcal detector block based on the flow cytometry
method using a semiconductor laser. RBCs and platelet count are analyzed by the
RBC detector using the Hydro Dynamic Focusing (DC Detection) method.
Hemoglobin(HBG) is analyzed by the HGB detector based on the SLS-
hemoglobin detection method. Analysis data is displayed on the panel keypad
LCD screen and IPU.
3. Modes of Operation:
Manual, Capillary, Sampler (Automatic), Manual Closed
4. Specimen Identification:
Specimen information is managed by four menu lists and specimen identification
input is manual (by operator) or by barcode reader.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Whole blood tubes (corresponding to the amount of EDTA anticoagulant) are
manually mixed by inversion before sampling.
6. Calibration:
The manufacturer’s instructions are to be followed for materials and frequency of
calibration. Following installation calibration, it is requested to verify instrument
calibration every six months or on an “as needed “ basis, and maintain good QC
practices, to ensure the accuracy of the system.
7. Quality Control:
The manufacturer’s instructions are to be followed for materials and frequency of
quality control analysis.
8. Software:
The role of the software on the XE-2100DC analyzer is to operate the instrument
in order to analyze whole blood samples and to provide a way to store and review
data. One of the software programs allows the user to set user-definable flags
according to their laboratory protocol. The XE IPU PIM (Patient Information
Manager) software analyzes the data and works in conjunction with the Windows
2000 operating system, which serves as an administrative function.

Each sample collected was split into 2 aliquots, one held at room temperature
(18o-26oC) and the other held at low temperature (4oC). Each sample was
analyzed on the XE-2100DC and the designated Reference instrument at baseline
(immediately or within 4 hours after blood collection), 24, 48 and 72 hours post
collection. MCV results were expressed as percent deviation from the baseline
measurement.
