4. Panel:

H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
For use with MicroScan® Synergies plus™ Panels read on the WalkAway® -SI
System (including upgraded WalkAway® -40 or WalkAway® -96 to meet
WalkAway® SI equivalence). MicroScan® panels are designed for use in
determining quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility
and/or identification to the species level of colonies, grown on solid media, of
rapidly growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-positive cocci and
Listeria.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The testing of rifampin at concentrations of 0.25 – 8 µg/mL to the gram-positive
test panel for testing Staphylococcus spp. at 4.5-16 hours or 16-20 hours for a
overnight reading.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
• Turbidity method of inoculum preparation only.
• For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
Each panel contains two control wells: a negative control well, and a growth control
well (contains test medium without antibiotic). Antibiotics are diluted in water,
buffer, or minute concentrations of broth to selected concentrations prior to
dehydration of the panels. The panel is rehydrated and inoculated at the same time
with 0.1 ml of suspension prepared by the turbidity method (inoculum prepared in
0.4% saline with Pluroinc®, then 0.1ml transferred to 25ml of inoculum Synergies
plus Pos Broth with Pluronic®) for a final inoculum concentration of 3-7 X 105
CFU/ml. Panels are incubated in a Walk-Away® System and read periodically
starting at 4.5 hours until sufficient growth to determine the MIC. Alternately the
panels may be incubated at 35o C in a non-CO for 16-24 hours and read by visual
2
observation of growth.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) M7 (M100-S15) “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
The WalkAway® SI uses a Colorimetric Optics System consisting of a color
wheel/lamp assembly and a Photosensor. There is an initial read at 2.5 hours with a
possible final read at 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 8, 12, 16 or18 hours (overnight instrument Deleted: , or
readings, manual readings) depending on the growth rate of the organism being
Deleted: )
tested. The time of final read is dependent on the user customization, the growth rate
Deleted:
of the organism, and the sensitivity of the automatic reader since cell densities below
2 x 107 cells/ml are not detected.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 270 isolates, tested at 3 sites on 3
separate days in triplicate. The study included the testing on the WalkAway®
SI read at <16 hours, WalkAway® 16-18 hour readings and manual readings
at 16-20 hours incubation. The WalkAway® SI had 3 results that were not
readable at <16 hours. All reading methods were overall reproducible at
>95%, except for the <16 hour readings. The result from one site was lower
than expected providing results just below the acceptable criteria.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC isolate was tested a sufficient number of times with
acceptable results on all testing days with the reference method. All Synergy
Plus panels, which are configured to produce readings at <16 hours, provided
QC results in the 4.5-16 hour window. Quality control results demonstrated
the ability of the different reading parameters (manual and instrument) to
produce acceptable results. The following table provides the frequency of the
results in each concentration tested with the expected range stated.

isolates tested at one site and compared to the reference broth dilution result
mode that was determined by previous testing of each isolate multiple times in
the recommended reference panel. The Synergies plus™ readings were
obtained at times between 4.5 and 16 hours of incubation for > 95% of the
results. An additional comparison was done with readings on the instrument
after overnight incubation and also read manually when incubated 16- 18
hours. Performance by these alternate reading methods was also acceptable
with no apparent differences or trends.
The recommended CLSI reference method was followed with the exception of
the use of a small amount (0.1%) Pluronic® in the final inoculum. A
validation of the use of Pluronic® in the frozen reference panels was
conducted. Similar calculations for the different reading methods were
performed with very little difference. QC was also performed with minimal
difference apparent in the results.
The chart below demonstrates the performance of all three reading methods
(Synergies plus™ readings at <16 hours, overnight on the WalkAway® and
manually read at 18 hours using the touchScan®-SR) when compared to the
reference method.

Evaluable results are those that fall within the test range of the reference
method and could also be on-scale with the new device if within the
plus/minus one dilution variability. EA is when there is agreement
between the reference method and the MicroScanMicroScan® Synergies
plus® within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of antibiotic. CA
is when the interpretation of the reference method agrees exactly with the
interpretation of the MicroScan® Synergies plus result.
