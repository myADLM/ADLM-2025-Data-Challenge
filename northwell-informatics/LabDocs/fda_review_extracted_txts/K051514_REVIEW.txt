4. Special instrument requirements:
Assure Pro Glucose Meter
I. Device Description:
The Advance Micro-Draw Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of a hand-held
blood glucose meter, test strips, and control materials. Each lot of test strips has a
code chip containing lot-specific calibration information that the machine reads
automatically. The meter is turned on by strip insertion; the user then supplies finger-
tip blood or control solution to the strip and the meter starts the assay, which
completes in 15 seconds. The meter’s software converts the results read off the test
strip into a plasma glucose concentration and displays the value on the meter’s LCD
screen.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
This submission covers modifications to the glucose meter. The original meter
and the control materials were previously cleared under k020232 as the
Hypoguard Advance. A strip modification was cleared under k031388. An
alternate site claim was added under k041881 but alternate site testing is not
claimed in this submission.
1. Predicate device name(s):
Hypoguard Advance Micro-Draw
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
k020232, k031388, k041881
3. Comparison with predicate:
Certain features of the glucose meter have been modified from the predicate:
- the test strip port is now on the top of the meter
- a strip-ejection mechanism has been added
- an adjustable backlight feature has been added
- alarm features have been added
The indications for use, the calculation algorithm, the test strips, and the control
solutions are unchanged.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Precision studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP5-A.
L. Test Principle:
The test is based on the release of electrical potential after a two-step reaction where
glucose and ferricyanide, in the presence of glucose oxidase, are converted into
gluconolactone and ferrocyanide. Ferrocyanide, when electrical current is applied,
becomes ferricyanide and releases electrons; the increase in current measured by the
meter is proportional to the glucose concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was tested in the manufacturer’s facility based on CLSI EP5-A.
Whole blood samples from non-diabetic volunteers were spiked to yield 6
glucose concentrations ranging from 30 – 600 mg/dL. The lowest level of
blood was allowed to glycolyze; all other samples were tested within four
hours of collection. Results were compared to YSI values. One strip lot was
tested. Within-run precision was tested on twenty replicates of each glucose
level; between-day precision was tested by six independent runs of within-day
precision. The sponsor set acceptance criteria as total CV% not to exceed 9.5
%. Testing results are summarized in the table below:
Summary of Precision Testing: Hypoguard Assure Pro
Target Range (mg/dL)
30-50 51-110 111-150 151-250 251-400 500-600 Avg
Within Run CV (%) 5.7 4.7 5.5 4.6 5.1 4.8 5.1
Between Run CV (%) 18 7.4 4.7 6 7 4.8 8
Total CV (%) 18.8 7.8 5.2 6.5 8.1 7.1 8.9
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The data from the precision study was used to determine linearity by plotting
the average YSI value against the average meter value for each glucose level
for each of the six days of testing. The regression analysis showed a linear
relationship between the Assure Pro and the YSI method: y = 0.92x + 23.5,
R = 0.98.
The sponsor conducted another linearity study using seven levels of glucose-
spiked blood covering the same range as the previous testing; two different
test strip lots were tested on three Assure Pro meters (n = 12 per level). The
regression analysis showed a linear relationship between the Assure Pro and
the YSI method: y = 0.96x + 6.6, R = 0.99.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
These parameters were established in the original submission (k020232).
d. Detection limit:

	Target Range (mg/dL)						
	30-50	51-110	111-150	151-250	251-400	500-600	Avg
Within Run CV (%)	5.7	4.7	5.5	4.6	5.1	4.8	5.1
Between Run CV (%)	18	7.4	4.7	6	7	4.8	8
Total CV (%)	18.8	7.8	5.2	6.5	8.1	7.1	8.9

The low and high detection limits for the Assure Pro system have been set at
20 and 600 mg/dL glucose. Twenty blood samples < 20 mg/dL (by YSI) and
20 samples between 800-900 mg/dL generated the expected “LO” and “HI”
result respectively.
e. Analytical specificity:
These parameters were established in the original submission (k020232).
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
See Clinical Studies section below.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. The meter’s software adjusts the whole-blood glucose reading
to a plasma-equivalent reading.
3. Clinical studies:
One hundred diabetics participated in a study to establish the clinical
characteristics of the Assure Pro System. Testing included men and women,
both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics, who span a wide range of education, and
spanned an age range from 18 to 81. Each participant was given the product
labeling, asked to read it, and then perform the test without the help of the
clinical study staff. The clinical staff collected capillary blood for YSI testing
and obtained results on two Assure Pro meters and the predicate meter. Ten
additional people with blood glucose levels below 100 mg/dL were tested at
the sponsor’s facility; some of these were not diabetics.
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The relationship between the glucose value obtained from YSI testing and the
average of the finger-stick values is described below:
Comparison of Assure Pro Glucose Values in Clinical Studies
Regression Analysis r value
Participant vs. YSI y = 0.89x + 15.6 0.94
Professional vs. YSI y = 0.91x + 12.0 0.96
Professional vs. Predicate y = 0.94x + 9.7 0.97
One method of comparing the significance of variability between finger-stick
values and YSI values is to determine how close the values are to each other.
Bias describes the difference as a percent of the finger-stick value. The more
tests that have a low percent bias suggests that the two tests give similar
readings:

However, differences between the two measurement systems may or may not
affect clinical decisions; the Clarke Error Grid method was used to determine
if differences between the methods might affect clinical outcome.

* YSI value = 63 mg/dL, Assure Pro value = 78 mg/dL. The cut-off for the D-
zone at 63 mg/dL is a meter value of 76 mg/dL or higher.

Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The normal fasting adult glucose range for a non-diabetic is 70 – 105 mg/dL. One
to two hours after a meal, normal blood glucose levels should be less than 140
mg/dL. A medical professional should determine the range that is appropriate for
diabetes patients.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
