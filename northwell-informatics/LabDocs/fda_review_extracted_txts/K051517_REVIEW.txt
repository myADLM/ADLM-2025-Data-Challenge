standards. The Elecsys® PreciControl products are assayed and compared to
these reference preparations and target values and ranges are assigned. Values
are assigned using Elecsys® MODULAR ANALYTICS E170, Elecsys®
2010 and Elecsys® 1010 Immunoassay Analyzers. Two independent series of
analyses are performed on each instrument for each analyte. Each sample is
tested in duplicate. The target value is calculated as the median of the
determined values.
Stability: Five studies were performed to verify the stability claims for
Elecsys® PreciControl Anemia. The acceptance criterion for Ferritin and
Vitamin B12 is recovery of 90%-110% of the concentration based on
unstressed material. The acceptance criterion for Folate II is for samples with
concentrations of ≤5 ng/mL, a SD ≤0.5 ng/mL and for concentrations >5
ng/mL is recovery of +/- 10%.
