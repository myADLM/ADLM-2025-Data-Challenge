K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced
L. Test Principle:
Not applicable
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Each control level is tested on a total of twelve Elecsys immunoassay
analyzers. Two series of measurements are performed on each instrument with
samples tested in duplicate. The method has been standardized against an in-
house reference standard: osteocalcin in analyte-free human serum matrix.
The target values for Osteocalcin are set at approximately 20, 100 and 205
ng/mL. Lyophilized control material is stable up to the stated expiration date.
Reconstituted control material is stable at 2-8º C for 5 days. Stability data at 5
days supports the package insert claim of 5 days. Percent recoveries at 5 days
meet the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of 90 – 110 % of concentration based
on unstressed material.
Reconstituted control material is stable frozen at -20º C for 1 month. Stability
data at one month supports the package insert claim of stability frozen at -20º
C for 1 month. Percent recoveries at 1 month meet the sponsor’s acceptance
criteria of 90 – 110 % of concentration based on unstressed material.
Reconstituted control material is stable for up to 8 hours at 20-25º C. Stability
data supports the package insert claim that the control is stable for up to 8
hours at 20-25º C. Percent recoveries meet the sponsor’s acceptance criteria
of 90-110%.
