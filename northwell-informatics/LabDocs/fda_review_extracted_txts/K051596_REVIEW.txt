L. Test Principle:
The StatusFirst™ CHF test device utilizes biotin coupled anti-NT-proBNP
antibody/streptavidin solid-phase chromatographic immunoassay technology to
quantitatively determine the concentration of NT-proBNP in human EDTA plasma
specimens. After a sample has been dispensed into the sample well, the StatusFirst™
CHF test device is placed in the DXpress™ Reader. The DXpress™ Reader displays
the NT-proBNP concentration 15 minutes after sample addition. The DXpress™
Reader is programmed to convert the intensity of the test band (as indicated by the
“pBNP” line on the test device) into a concentration of NT-proBNP automatically by
using lot specific calibration factors supplied with each box of test devices. The NT-
proBNP concentration in the sample correlates with the intensity of the test band.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Each plasma sample having an elevated NT-proBNP concentration (hi pool)
was diluted with a sample pool with a low NT-proBNP concentration (<20
pg/mL) for a total of nine values spanning the measuring range of the
StatusFirst™ CHF test device. Each undiluted and diluted sample was tested
in 15 replicates. The results are shown in the table below.

d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection, (LoD), represents the lowest known concentration of
NT-proBNP that can be reliably differentiated from zero. The LoD of of the
StatusFirst™ CHF test is 20 pg/mL, determined according to Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, formerly NCCLS) guideline EP17-A
and with proportions of false positives (α) less than 5% and false negatives (β)
less than 5% based on 120 determinations, with 60 blank and 60 low-level
samples (limit of blank = 5pg/mL).
e. Analytical specificity:
The following proteins and peptides were tested for potential cross-reactivity
in the StatusFirst™ CHF test device at the maximum concentration of
substance indicated. No substance demonstrated significant cross-reactivity
(all cross-reactivities < 0.1%) when added to sample containing a recombinant
NT-proBNP concentration of approximately 200 pg/mL. The results are
shown in the table below.

Patients 75 years of age and older: 450 pg/mL
NT-proBNP results less than or equal to the decision threshold values are
considered normal values representative of patients without CHF
Results greater than the above stated decision threshold values are considered
abnormal and suggestive of patients with CHF.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A substantial equivalence study was performed between the StatusFirst™
CHF and the Roche Elecsys® 2010 proBNP assays using clinical samples
within the measuring range of both assays (n=648). When plotting the
StatusFirst™ results versus the Roche Elecsys® results, the data showed a
slope of 0.956 and intercept of 9.4 pg/mL (Passing Bablok regression), and a
Spearman Rank correlation of 0.973.
b. Matrix comparison:
EDTA plasma is the only sample type indicated
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Cut off levels of 125 pg/mL for subjects under 75 years of age and 450 pg/mL
for subjects over 75 years of age were used to calculate the sensitivity (for
CHF subjects) and specificity (for non-CHF subjects) values of the
StatusFirst™ CHF assay. The results are shown in the table below.
