The values for the Direct HDL Cholesterol were derived from human serum
correlation studies versus the Designated Comparison Method of the National
Cholesterol Education Program.
Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found
acceptable. Stability is performed on 3 lots of material. After real time
stability studies, the product was assigned 24 months stability. After
reconstitution, the calibrator is stable for 3 days at 2 – 8˚C.
