containing the enzyme glucose oxidase. A blood sample is applied to the blood collection
area at the tip of the strip and is automatically drawn into the reaction zone, where the
glucose oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of glucose to produce gluconic acid. During the
reaction, a mediator transfers electrons to the electrode surface and generates a current. The
amount of the current is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the blood sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The sponsor conducted performance studies according to ISO 15197 (see section K above).
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intermediate precision testing was conducted with 3 levels of glucose prepared from
control solutions. Each sample was measured daily for 12 days using ten meters
across multiple strip lots (each assigned a meter). The glucose concentration ranges
were 30 to 50 mg/dL, 96 to 144 mg/dL and 280 to 420 mg/dL. The results are shown
in the chart below.
Range (mg/dL) N Mean (mg/dL) SD CV %
30-50 120 44.1 2.2 4.9
96-144 120 134.9 5.9 4.4
280-420 120 353.6 18.6 5.2
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was conducted by comparing nine prepared whole blood samples on
the G4 test strip (one lot) and a glucose reference method (YSI 2300 STAT Plus) that
spanned the range of 15 to 710 mg/dL. The mean value of each aliquot was
calculated. The linear regression equation for the linear regression analysis of results
form the G4 device and the YSI method was Y= 1.0x – 17.976 with an R of 0.993.
The measuring range is 20 to 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor conducted both a real time shelf-life and use time (open vial) stability
study for the G4 Control solutions. The real-time shelf-life stability study was
evaluated every 60 to 120 days for 540 days. The use time stability study was
evaluated every 7 to 10 days for 90 days. Both studies were conducted in a cool, dry
place with a temperature of 8 to 30° C.
Real-time shelf-life studies performed by the manufacturer indicate that unopened G4
Control Solutions have a shelf-life period of 18 months and a use- life (open-vial) of
3 months.

280-420	120	353.6	18.6	5.2

--- Page 5 ---
The G4 test strips were evaluated for shelf-life stability (closed vial) in an accelerated
study. A continuing real-time study is being conducted on three lots that are tested
weekly for 540 days. The accelerated study shows stability of 18 months for
unopened test strips and 3 months for open test strips.
Value assignments for three lots of both levels of control solutions (6 lots total) were
determined using 5 replicates of one test strip lot read on a G4 meter.
d. Detection limit:
The low and high detection limits for the G4 Meter Device have been set at 20 and
600 mg/dL. Readings below or above these values will generate a “Lo” or “Hi” result
respectively.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study that evaluated heparinized whole blood samples was conducted
with the G4 device. The YSI 2300 STAT Plus was used as the reference method.
Two interferent levels were tested (n=5) in two blood glucose concentrations (~ 87
and 200 mg/dL) with one lot of test strips. The difference, average, standard
deviation, CV and % bias were calculated and the interference results met the
sponsor’s acceptance criteria. Interferences were tested at two levels shown in the
chart below.

• High concentrations of acetaminophen and other reducing substances in the blood
may cause inaccurately high results.
• Blood samples that contain a high concentration of dissolved oxygen may lower
the test result.
• Antiglycolytics and anticoagulants in blood samples may affect the test results.
Hematocrit Effect
The effect of sample hemoglobin variation on the G4 device was tested
experimentally by preparing samples of three known hematocrit values (20, 40%
(normal) and 60%) at four blood glucose concentrations in replicates of ten. The YSI
2300 STAT Plus served as the reference instrument. The difference, average, SD, %
CV and bias were calculated. The results from the hematocrit study met the
sponsors’ acceptance criteria.

Altitude Effect
The monitors and strips were tested at 3050 meters to determine performance at low
oxygen levels and low atmospheric pressures. This study used sixty -six G4 devices.
The results were obtained and compared with sea level and YSI results taken in
triplicate. The sponsor found that the percent error of the G4 device (both at sea level
and 3050 meters) was less than 15%. The sponsor states that altitudes of up to 3050
meters do not affect the device.
Temperature and humidity study
The sponsor conducted temperature and humidity studies according to ISO 15197.
Two studies that tested the strip results at specified temperature and humidity ranges
were conducted. The temperatures tested were 8, 12, 20, 25, 38 and 42° C and the
humidity tested were 35% and 85%.
The G4 device has available a temperature correction program that enables the device
to obtain consistent results if obtain between 12 and 38° C. Blood with glucose
concentrations of 55, 90, 145, 265 and 400 mg/dL (kept at 37° C) were tested in
replicates of 10 at six different temperatures. The G4 device was tested for its ability
to give consistent results if measurements are taken when humidity is between 35 and
85%. Blood with glucose concentrations of 150, 264 and 400 mg/dL (kept at 37° C)
were tested in replicates of 10 in 2 different humid environments. The results for
both studies are listed below.

The sponsor studies showed that the program of temperature correction allows users
to obtain correct results between 12 and 38° C. The results also showed that the error
message”Er3” works when the temperature is outside of the sponsors claimed range.
The humidity results also showed that the device gives correct results when the
measurements are taken within the sponsors claimed humidity range (35 – 85%).

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Three separate clinical studies of the G4 device performance were performed.
A method comparison study was conducted with the G4 device against 2 predicates:
LifeScan, Inc. SureStep and Roche Accu-check advantage. Three trained technicians
collected capillary blood from 110 patients (68 men and 42 women). One of the
results was excluded because the measurement fell outside the device range. The
equation for the G4 versus the SureStep was y=1.0565x- 10.329 and r= 0.9923. The
equation for the G4 versus the Accu-check was y=1.0224x + 1.4685 and r= 0.9852.
A consumer field study was performed in which the results obtained by 50
participants (in triplicate gave n=150) were compared to trained healthcare
professional results and values obtained with YSI values. The study used test strips
from 3 different lots. The lay-users ranged in age, education, and appropriately
divided between female and male. The questionnaire and training materials were
provided in English. Each participant performed their own finger stick and tested
their blood using the instructions provided with the G4 system. After the user’s self-
test, the investigation site’s trained healthcare professional performed another finger
stick and tested the blood on the same meter. Capillary blood was collected and the
YSI values were obtained.

N. Instrument Name:
G4 Meter Device
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Test strips can only be used once. Users must replace the strip before taking additional
readings.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes __X______ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended for use with fresh capillary whole blood. Since the sample is
applied directly to the test strip there are no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
Each bottle of test strips has a test code on the vial. The code numbers on the G4 Meter
display and G4 Test strips must match. The user must compare the code number printed
on the test strip vial with the user interface of the meter.
6. Quality Control:
The company provides two levels of glucose control solutions (also sold separately) with
the device. To access the accuracy of the meter in combination with the strips, glucose
control solutions that contain a known amount of glucose are tested with the meter. The
company also provides a check strip to help users determine if the meter is functioning
