L. Test Principle:
The OPTIGEN assay employs a small plastic device known as a pette or test chamber
to expose patient serum simultaneously to a number of allergens or allergen mixes.
The pette contains polystyrene solid phase and integrated lenslets, as well as one
Negative Blanking Control and one Positive Procedural Control.
The OPTIGEN assay is run by filling a pette with patient serum after a pre-wash step.
As the serum incubates, IgE in the patient serum binds to the allergen coated wells.
After an incubation period, the pette is washed with buffer solution to remove
unbound serum. Next, an enzyme labeled anti-IgE antibody is added to the pette and
the antibody couples with the serum IgE bound to the wells. After a second wash, the
pette is filled with a photo-reagent mixture which reacts with the enzyme labeled

antibody to produce chemilumniscence. The amount of light emitted is proportional
to the amount of allergen-specific IgE in the patient serum. The light emitted is read
in the CLA-1 Luminometer and reported as Light Units (LU).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within Assay: Ten serum replicates were run in one batch. The average mean
coefficient of variation of the responses was calculated per class.
Class % CV
1 31
2 16
3 16
4 5
Between Assays: Ten replicates of a serum were run on five different days.
The mean coefficient of variation of the responses of all allergens tested was
calculated per class.
Class % CV

2 15
3 9
4 1
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Assay reportable range is 0-300 LU
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
No claim was made for traceability to a reference standard.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit was calculated by running negative patient sera in the
OPTIGEN assay with different lots of devices. The detection limit was
calculated from the average signal obtained with all the sera in all the
allergens wells plus 3 times the Standard Deviation (Std) as shown below:
N = 273
Average = 2.4 LU
Std = 7.95 LU
Average +3(Std) = 26.25 LU
The detection limit of the assay is 26 LUs.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity: The manufacturer states there is no detectable cross-
reactivity with human serum immunoglobulins IgG, IgM, IgA or IgD at
normal physiological levels.
f. Assay cut-off:
To calculate patient’s IgE response, the Luminometer automatically subtracts
the emission level of the Negative Control from the emission level of each

allergen. CLA Class Values are assigned based on the amount of light emitted
by the individual allergens in the pette. The concentrations of IgE associated
with CLA class values and instrument readings are listed in the table below.
Class cut-offs for the OPTIGEN Assay are the following:
Class LU
0 0-26
1 27-65
2 66-142
3 143-242
4 243-300
CLA Class 0 represents absence of non-detectable levels of allergen-specific
antibodies.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Comparison studies were performed in 3 sites (France, Germany, and USA)
with the OPTIGEN Universal Panel 20 Allergen Specific IgE Assay and the
predicate device Pharmacia CAP System Specific IgE Assay. A total of 1753
determinations were made and results are summarized in the comparison table
below.
