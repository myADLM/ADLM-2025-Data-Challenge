c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Roche Diagnostics maintains a set of master calibrators for each assay that
have values assigned that are traceable to the various method “gold
standards.” Elecsys® PreciControl products are assayed and compared to
these reference preparations and target values and ranges are assigned.
Values are assigned using a total of 12 analyzers except for hCG; hCG
values were assigned using 8 analyzers. Two independent series of analyses
are performed on each instrument for each analyte. Each sample is tested in
duplicate. The target value is calculated as the median of the determined
values.
Four studies were performed on reconstituted material to verify the stability
claims.
Elecsys PreciControl Universal material and reference material are evaluated
in triplicate. The Elecsys PreciControl Universal material is stressed. The
reference material is an unstressed set of Elecsys PreciControl Universal. One
