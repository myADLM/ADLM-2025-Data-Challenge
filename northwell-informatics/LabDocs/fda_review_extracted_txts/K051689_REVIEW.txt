rapid identification (ID) and quantitative determination of antimicrobial
susceptibility by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of gram-positive aerobic
and facultative anaerobic bacteria belonging to the genera Staphylococcus and
Enterococcus.
2. Indication(s) for use:
This submission is for the addition of the antibiotic daptomycin at concentrations
of 0.125 – 32 μg/mL to the gram positive susceptibility panel.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST
Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and
equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™
Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST broth, which contains an AST
indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST broth is a cation-adjusted formulation
of Mueller-Hinton broth containing 0.01% Tween 80. After adding the indicator solution
to the AST inoculum the color is blue and after inoculation and incubation goes to pink to
colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned
and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System instrument where
the panels are continuously incubated at 35°C. The AST has a final inoculum of 5 x 105
CFU/ml. The instrument incubates, reads and records the results of the biochemical
substrates and antimicrobial agents and interprets the reactions to give an ID of the isolate
and MIC value and category interpretation of the antimicrobial agents. Organisms
growing in the presence of a given antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator, signaling
organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or inhibited
by a given antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do not
produce a color change. Additional interpretation is done using software driven
“EXPERT” System using rules derived from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI).
Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an ID result available between 2-12 hours and
an AST result available between 4-16 hours. This is only an autoread result; there are no
manual readings possible.

of organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells
containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control
wells” which contains no antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Forty gram-positive on-scale organisms were evaluated for site to site and
inter site reproducibility demonstrating >95% reproducibility. The ten isolate
study described in the guidance document was used (10 organisms tested 3
times on 3 days at 3 sites).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The FDA and CLSI recommended QC isolates, E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and
S. aureus ATCC 29213 were tested on every test occasion with the reference
method and the BD Phoenix™. The reference method QC results were in
range for every day tested. The Phoenix™ was tested a sufficient number of
times to demonstrate that the system can produce QC results in the CLSI
recommended ranges most of the time. Two additional QC organisms were
also tested, S. aureus ATCC 25923 and S. sciuri ATCC 29062 with results
included in the QC table below. All QC organisms had the same mode with
the reference and the BD Phoenix™ however, only the FDA and CLSI
recommended QC isolates will be included in the package insert.

CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer which was verified each day of testing.
Internal data was used to demonstrate that the use of the BBL™
CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer would produce reproducible results.
Five different instruments were used.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The CLSI recommended broth dilution reference panel was prepared
according to the CLSI recommendation. Clinical testing was performed at
four sites. The concentration of calcium on the Mueller Hinton Broth was
adjusted to 50 ug/mL as recommended by the CLSI and FDA. The testing
included both fresh clinical isolates and stock isolates along with a challenge
set with known results. The test device had a growth rate of >95%. A
comparison was provided to the reference method with the following
agreement.

agreement (CA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panel result interpretation agrees exactly with
the reference panel result interpretation. Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale
for both the BD Phoenix™ and the reference and have on-scale EA.
There appears to be a trend where the test device is slightly more resistant than the test
device as reflected in the Accuracy studies however results are still within essential
agreement.

The current absence of data on resistant strains precludes defining any results
other than “Susceptible”. Strains yielding MIC results suggestive of a “non-
