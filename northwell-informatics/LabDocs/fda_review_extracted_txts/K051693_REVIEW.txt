510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
K051693
B. Purpose for Submission:
Addition of new parameter
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Bayer HealthCare LLC, Diagnostics Division, ADVIA 2120 with Autoslide System
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Nucleated Red Blood Cells (nRBC) Method, quantitative
E. System Descriptions:
1. Devise Description:
The technological and methodological principles of the ADVIA 2120 with
Autoslide used for the measurement of blood cells in whole blood specimens will
be used without change except for the addition of a new methodology to
quantitate nucleated red blood cells and correct white blood cells in peripheral
whole blood.
The ADVIA 2120 nRBC method reports nRBC counts for whole blood with
either 200 or more nRBC/µL, or with at least 2% nRBCs with a WBC count of at
least 3,000/ul.
The method reports both an absolute nRBC count (109/L) and a percentage count
(#nRBC/100 WBC). The software corrects the WBC count for nRBC, recalculates
the WBC differential, and recalculates %MN and %PMN. The uncorrected counts
are also available and are designated by a lower case “u.”
2. Principles of Operation:
The ADVIA 2120 nRBC method uses histogram analysis routines to analyze the
unstained region of the Peroxidase channel as well as arithmetic an algorithm that
combines counts from the Peroxidase and Basophil/Lobularity channel to
enumerate nRBCs.

The analysis corrects the White Blood Cell Count (WBC) for the presence of
nRBCs, as well as the WBC Differential. It reports the corrected WBC count and
the corrected differential.
3. Modes of Operation:
Not applicable.
4. Specimen Identification:
Not applicable.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The ADVIA 2120 nRBC method requires whole blood collected in an evacuated
tube containing EDTA as an anticoagulant. Samples requiring nRBC count should
not be refrigerated and must be analyzed within eight hours of phlebotomy.
6. Calibration:
Proper calibration of the ADVIA 2120 Baso WBC and Perox WBC counts are
required for accurate nRBC counts. Calibration is as necessary using the
instructions provided by the ADVIA 2120 Hematology System Operator’s Guide.
7. Quality Control:
Quality control of the ADVIA 2120 nRBC method can be performed with
commercially available control materials. In the event that control materials are
not available, the method should be controlled following agency requirement for
the user’s laboratory.
8. Software:
The ADVIA 2120 software updates the Run Screen options and provides unit set
options to support nRBC analysis. The customer is to refer to the ADVIA
Hematology System Operator’s Guide for detailed instructions on configurations.
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and Software Development

I. Special Control/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
H20-A Reference Leukocyte Differential Count (Proportional) and Evaluation of
Instrument Methods, Approved Standard, NCCLS
J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
Systematic bias of the ADVIA 2120 nRBC count was evaluated by comparing
ADVIA 2120 nRBC counts to reference manual counts for 744 samples
collected at clinical trial sites. Regression statistics are found in the table that
follows:
Manual ADVIA
Parameter r Slope Intercept Mean 2120 Mean Bias
nRBC% 0.970 0.98 -0.6 11.9 11.1 -0.8
#nRBC 0.992 0.98 -0.15 1.91 1.82 -0.09
(x109/L)
Corrected 0.997 1.02 -0.14 11.54 11.64 0.10
WBC
The ADVIA 2120 only provides an accurate nRBC count for samples with
≥ 2% nRBC.
b. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run precision was evaluated by performing duplicate assays of 45
samples with nRBC counts of 2% or more. Precision results are as follows:
Parameter Mean SD CV
nRBC% 26.7 4.6 17.2
#nRBC (x10o/L) 4.0 0.4 10.0
Corrected WBC 14.7 0.5 3.4
c. Linearity:
The analytical range or range of reportable values for nRBC% is 2 –
300%. #nRBC values are reportable if the nRBC% associated with the
#nRBC value falls within those limits.
In a study to evaluate the performance of the ADVIA 2120 nRBC% over
the analytical range the nRBC method was found to have a specificity of
92% at a level of 2% nRBCs.

d. Carryover:
The ADVIA 2120 nRBC method uses hydraulic cycles that are identical to
those contained in software versions prior to version 5.2.x. Therefore, the
expected carryover remains the same when using version 5.2.x (< 1% for
all parameters).
e. Interfering Substances:
• Unlysed RBCs: The RBCs from peripheral blood samples from newborns
and patients with certain disorders (e.g. thalassemia) may be resistant to lysis.
The unlysed RBCs occupy the same region of the Peroxidase cytogram as the
nRBCs and interfere with the count.
• Large platelets: In certain disease states the peripheral blood may contain
many large platelets that also occupy the same region of the Peroxidase
channel as nRBCs. The large platelets will interfere with nRBC enumeration.
• Lipids: Samples from patients undergoing total parenteral nutrition may
contain lipids of high enough concentration to interfere with sample analysis
on the ADVIA 2120. The effect is observed in both the ADVIA 2120
Peroxidase and Basophil/Lobularity channels and could compromise the
nRBC count.
The ADVIA 2120 software provides four sample/system flags to help
identify samples that may have invalid nRBC counts due to interfering
substances.
