The JBAIDS Anthrax Detection System is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test
system intended for the qualitative in vitro diagnostic (IVD) detection of target DNA sequences
on the pXO1 plasmid (Target 1) and the pXO2 plasmid (Target 2) from Bacillus anthracis. The
system can be used to test human whole blood collected in sodium citrate from individuals
suspected of having anthrax, positive blood cultures, and cultured organisms grown on blood
agar plates. The JBAIDS Anthrax Target 2 assay is used as a supplementary test only after a
positive result with the Target 1 Assay.
The JBAIDS Anthrax Target 1 and Target 2 Assays are run on the JBAIDS instrument using the
Diagnostic Wizard.

Results are for the presumptive identification of B. anthracis, in conjunction with culture and
other laboratory tests. The following considerations also apply:
(cid:131) The diagnosis of anthrax infection must be made based on history, signs, symptoms,
exposure likelihood, other laboratory evidence, in addition to the identification of pXO1
and pXO2 targets either from cultures or from direct blood specimens.
(cid:131) The assays have not been evaluated with blood from individuals without clinical signs or
symptoms who were presumed exposed and who subsequently developed anthrax
(inhalation or other forms of the disease), or from individuals with any form of anthrax
(inhalational, cutaneous, or gastrointestinal).
(cid:131) The level of plasmid targets that would be present in blood from individuals with early
systemic infection is unknown.
(cid:131) The definitive identification of B. anthracis from colony growth, liquid blood culture
growth, or from blood specimens requires additional testing and confirmation procedures
in consultation with public health or other authorities for whom reports are required.
The safety and effectiveness of other types of tests or sample types (not identified as “For in
vitro diagnostic use”) have not been established.

4. Special instrument requirements:
The JBAIDS Anthrax Target 1 and Target 2 Assays are run on the JBAIDS instrument using the
Diagnostic Wizard and the JBAIDS software.
I. Device Description:
2

--- Page 3 ---
The JBAIDS Anthrax Detection System is an integrated in vitro diagnostic (IVD) system
composed of the JBAIDS instrument with laptop computer, software and two different freeze-
dried sets of reagents (in one kit) for the detection of the pXO1 plasmid (Target 1) and the
pXO2 plasmid (Target 2) from B. anthracis.
The JBAIDS Anthrax Detection System is designed to detect virulent forms of B. anthracis by
detecting sequences within two plasmids, pXO1 and pXO2, that carry genes encoding for the
organism’s two major virulence factors, the anthrax toxin complex and the capsular polypeptide.
All samples are initially tested for Target 1, and only specimens that are positive are
subsequently tested for Target 2. Both of these plasmids are required for virulence. Since non-
plasmid containing B. anthracis have been isolated from the environment and these plasmids can
be transferred to other bacteria, definitive identification of B. anthracis and discriminating it
from other Bacillus species requires detection of specific chromosomal signatures and
characteristic phenotypic features in consultation with the appropriate public health authorities.
The JBAIDS instrument, using PCR technology, is a portable thermocycler and real-time
fluorimeter. The JBAIDS System Manual for the JBAIDS instrument and the software has a
clearly defined workflow for diagnostic assays. The diagnostic workflow is accessed using the
Diagnostic Wizard, which can only be used with legally marketed assays that are intended for in
vitro diagnostic (IVD) use. When using the Diagnostic Wizard, the software ensures that the
assays are conducted according to the product specifications, including the appropriate use of
controls and application of the correct instrument settings. Data related to clinical assays are
stored in a separate database used only for diagnostic test runs and results.
The JBAIDS Anthrax Detection Kit is specially designed for PCR in glass capillaries using the
JBAIDS instrument and hydrolysis probes for detection of Target 1 and Target 2 DNA
sequences. Amplicon is detected using a specific hydrolysis probe, which is a short
oligonucleotide that hybridizes to an internal sequence of the amplified fragment during the
annealing phase of the PCR cycle. This probe has the 5’ and 3’ ends labeled with a reporter dye
and a quenching dye, respectively. When the probe hybridizes to the specific DNA target, the
Taq polymerase enzyme replicating the target-specific DNA hydrolyzes the probe, separating the
two fluorophores, thus allowing the reporter dye to fluoresce.
The characteristics of the amplification curves from the positive control (PC), negative control
(NC), inhibition controls (IC) and from each unknown sample are analyzed using mathematical
algorithms by the JBAIDS Software. Results are reported as Positive, Negative, Inhibited or
Uncertain. When PCs or NCs are unacceptable, the test result for all samples in the JBAIDS run
are considered Invalid and must be repeated.

L. Test Principle:
DNA is initially extracted and purified from whole blood specimens using the Idaho Technology
IT 1-2-3TM FLOW Sample Purification Kit (or validated equivalent), and from blood culture
and direct culture samples using the Idaho Technology IT 1-2-3TM SWIPE Sample Purification
Kit (or validated equivalent). The purified sample is added to the freeze-dried reagent vial along
with reconstitution buffer, and centrifuged into the tips of composite glass/plastic reaction
capillaries. The JBAIDS Anthrax Detection Kit is specially designed for PCR in glass capillaries
using the JBAIDS instrument and hydrolysis probes to detect pXO1 plasmid (Target 1) and
pXO2 plasmid (Target 2) DNA sequences. Amplicon is cumulatively detected using a specific
hydrolysis probe, a short oligonucleotide that hybridizes to an internal sequence of the amplicon
during the annealing phase of the PCR cycle. This probe has the 5’ and 3’ ends labeled with a
reporter dye and a quenching dye, respectively. When the probe hybridizes to the specific DNA
target, the Taq polymerase enzyme replicating the target-specific DNA hydrolyzes the probe,
separating the two fluorophores, and allowing the reporter dye to fluoresce.
The characteristics of the amplification curves from the positive control (PC), negative control
(NC), inhibition controls (IC) and from each unknown sample are analyzed by the JBAIDS
Software, and results are reported as Positive, Negative, Inhibited or Uncertain. When PCs or
NCs are unacceptable, the test result for all samples in the JBAIDS run are considered Invalid
and must be repeated. PCR-based methods are well-established; approaches for software
modeling of growth curves are not well-established. Genotypic characterization of B. anthracis
is better understood than 10 years ago. However, culture-based methods remain the reference
approach for detecting the organism in clinical samples.

A multi-center reproducibility study was assessed precision between-site using sample panels
prepared by spiking either the whole blood or simulated blood culture matrix with inactivated B.
anthracis Ames vegetative cells to represent a matrix blank (no organism), low, medium or high
levels of organism. The samples were tested at 3 external sites and at Idaho Technology’s
facility on 3 different days. One apparent false positive and one apparent false negative were
recorded at one site and attributed to carousel misloading. Training and experience is required
for performing the testing. The testing algorithm (Target 2 as a supplementary test) and
requirement for use with blood culturing is designed to mitigate such errors.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
5-1000 Genomic equivalents/reaction (both Target 1 and 2); approximately 1,000-
50,000 bacterial cells/mL
One genomic equivalent (GE) is defined as the molecular weiht of 1 genome of B.
anthracis DNA. Because the number of plasmids is variable between organisms, one
GE is the total number of base pairs (5.23 x 106) that encompasses one copy of
chromosomal DNA plus one copy each of the pX01 and pX02 plasmids or 5.78
femtograms DNA.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The following table provides information about the Cp (crossing point) values obtained for
positive amplification curves, including the PCs, during the clinical and selected non-clinical
evaluations of this product. The Cp value is the approximate PCR cycle number when the signal
for a positive amplification curve rises above the background fluorescence. Cp values are not
assigned to negative amplification curves.

a These IC Cp values are representative of testing negative samples. The Cp values for IC associated with positive sample will be
earlier (smaller number) due to the additional DNA added to the IC reactions.
The early Cp values associated with culture samples (blood culture and direct culture) are indicative of the high
concentration of B. anthracis in these sample types.
d. Detection limit:
The analytic sensitivity (limit of detection) of the test system was determined by spiking 68
whole blood samples (obtained from 68 different healthy donors) with live vegetative B.
anthracis at 1,000 CFU/mL and testing them using both the Target 1 and Target 2 assays. Sixty
seven (67) out of 68 spiked whole blood samples were successfully detected (positive for both
assays) resulting in a limit of detection of 1,000 CFU/mL of vegetative B. anthracis cells in
whole blood samples. The sensitivity of the test system using B. anthracis spores was not
evaluated.
e. Analytical specificity:
Panels of well-characterized non-B. anthracis were tested using both the Target 1 and Target 2
assays. The results of the JBAIDS test were considered negative only if both the Target 1 and
Target 2 assays were negative. This evaluation was performed with three different sample types,
genomic DNA (DNA panel), organism grown on sheep blood agar plates (Direct culture panel)
and positive blood cultures (Blood culture panel). The testing was performed as described in the
previous section.

a One isolate of B. anthracis Sterne was excluded from the analysis because it gave uncertain and negative test results with the
Target 2 assay when it should have been negative. The mostly likely explanation for this result was that this DNA sample
became contaminated with very low levels of DNA that reacted with the Target 2 assay.
b Three B. cereus strains causing anthrax-like illness tested positive
c. Two of these organisms, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, initially tested positive for both
the Target 1 and Target 2 assays. Retesting of a newly prepared blood culture yielded the expected negative results.
For the direct culture and blood culture panels, the non-virulent B. anthracis included in the test
panel gave the expected microbiology results, including a positive gamma phage result, and also
gave the expected JBAIDS result. In the direct culture panel, the three unexpected findings were
B. cereus 03BB102 which tested positive for both B. anthracis Target 1 and Target 2, and B.
cereus 03BB87 and B. cereus G9241, both of which tested positive with the Target 1 assay. All
three of these B. cereus organisms have been associated with anthrax-like illnesses and/or
death.7,8 Follow-up testing using other pXO1 and pXO2 real time PCR assays yielded results
that were in agreement with the JBAIDS results.
f. Assay cut-off:
A data analysis module within assay-specific software applies mathematical modeling
of expected amplification curve shapes to each individual capillary. When fixed
thresholds with a quadratic formula or crossing point determination are matched,
samples are called negative or positive. For undecided samples, an expert system
approach is applied that uses filters to assess the fluorescence change around the
crossing point.
2. Comparison studies: NA
a. Method comparison with predicate device: NA
b. Matrix comparison: NA
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Due to the rare incidence of systemic anthrax disease, evaluating performance with
blood specimens from infected patients was not possible. Testing with surrogate
samples can be used to infer effectiveness with such samples, along with mitigating
risk of a false negative by performing in conjunction with blood culture procedures.
b. Clinical specificity:
A multi-center clinical evaluation was conducted over a 4-month period and included
150 patients exhibiting symptoms consistent with systemic anthrax. Patients were
selected from those who were hospitalized, exhibited the clinical definition of Systemic
Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and for whom a blood culture had been
ordered. The study subjects ranged in age from 18-90 years (mean 48.5), and 56%

were male. The study was conducted at three U.S. military medical installations in
Texas, Washington DC, and Egypt. The clinical specificity of the JBAIDS Anthrax
Detection System was assessed by comparing the JBAIDS results (positive/negative) to
the results obtained by established culture and microbiology follow-up methods. With
the evaluation of clinical blood specimens, no patients with B. anthracis bacteremia
were sampled during the study period. This is not unexpected for a rare human
disease. Because sensitivity of the test system for B. anthracis in blood samples from
individuals with systemic anthrax cannot be determined, the intended use advises that
the test system must be considered presumptive and done in conjunction with other
microbiology testing particularly blood cultures. For inhibited, uncertain or invalid results
were obtained with testing on the direct blood samples, following the repeat algorithm
and use of the Target 2 assay as supplementary to the initial Target 1 assay, mitigated
the potential for a false positive result being reported.

product insert.
With recommended follow-up testing, all 150 samples included in the study gave the expected
negative results for both the Target 1 and Target 2 assays and none of the blood cultures taken
from the 150 patients grew B. anthracis. The clinical specificity of the JBAIDS Anthrax
Detection System is at least 98% (lower bound of 95% confidence interval).

During the clinical evaluation there was one failure of the Target 1 PC (1/76 or 1.3%) and no
failures of the Target 2 PC (n=72). All NCs were successful (76 Target 1 NCs and 72 Target 2
NCs). Of the 76 JBAIDS runs performed in the clinical trial, one (1.3%) had to be repeated due
to an instrument failure.

3. Specimen Identification:
Specimen information is a pre-defined protocol that guides a user through entering
sample information, loading the JBAIDS carousel, and starting the testing sequence.
Data, result call displays and generation of final reports is managed through the traceable
database using the Diagnostic Wizard. Capillaries are identified by their position number
in the carousel.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Blood specimens must be collected in tubes with sodium citrate anticoagulant. Other
anticoagulants are not indicated and may contribute to unreliable results. DNA is initially
extracted and purified from whole blood specimens using the Idaho Technology IT 1-2-
3TM FLOW Sample Purification Kit (or validated equivalent), and from blood culture
and direct culture samples using the Idaho Technology IT 1-2-3TM SWIPE Sample
Purification Kit (or validated equivalent). Purified samples must be diluted prior to
adding to reagent vials.
5. Calibration:
The fluorimeter is factory-calibrated. Internal self-check procedures are run with each
startup. Cycling temperatures are monitored continuously during a run. The internal
control and positive control must meet specific criteria for a successful run.
6. Quality Control:
The NC (a reagent blank) detects contamination from target specific amplicon, genomic
DNA (as found in the PC and IC reagent vials) or organism. One NC (2 capillaries) must be
included for each assay in a test run (Target 1 or Target 2). Both of the NC capillaries must
be negative or the JBAIDS software will assign Invalid results to all the associated samples
and the run will need to be repeated. Frequent or repeated failures of NCs may indicate
significant contamination of the work area.
The PC (containing purified B. anthracis DNA) serves as an amplification and detection
control. One PC (2 capillaries) must be included for each assay in a test run (Target 1 or
Target 2). Both PC capillaries must be positive or the JBAIDS software will assign Invalid
results to all the associated samples and the run will need to be repeated. In addition, the
operator should manually evaluate the Crossing point (Cp) values for the PC capillaries. If
the Cp for any of the PC capillaries is greater than 36, the run should be considered invalid.
Failure of the PCs may indicate errors in sample set-up, degradation of the reagents or a
malfunction of the JBAIDS instrument. If the IC capillaries in the same test run are Positive,
then the failure is most likely caused by an isolated error with the set-up of the PC. If the IC
capillaries are also Negative, possible causes for the failure are (1) a systematic error in
sample set-up, (2) degradation of the reagents or (3) a malfunction of the JBAIDS
instrument.
The IC demonstrates that the purified sample does not interfere with, or inhibit, the PCR
reaction. Each purified sample is tested using an Unknown vial and an IC vial (for a total of
4 capillaries). If either of the IC amplification curves demonstrates inhibition then the result
12

--- Page 13 ---
for that sample will be Inhibited. IC amplification curves are called Inhibited by the JBAIDS
software if (1) the Cp value for the IC is significantly delayed (more than 3 cycles) compared
to the amplification curve of the PC or (2) if the shape of the amplification curve
demonstrates reduced PCR efficiency as evidenced by a flattening of the amplification curve.
Each laboratory can trend Cp values for the Positive Control, and maintain records according
to standard laboratory quality control practices. Any trend variations should be investigated.
A procedure to monitor the sample extraction/purification component of the test system can
be used for training or for verification of user technique. Well characterized strains of B.
anthracis and other Bacillus species may be used as external negative and positive controls in
accordance with guidelines or requirements of local, state and/or federal regulations or
accrediting organizations. However, use of B. anthracis strains containing either, or both, of
the pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids is not feasible in many settings. Studies conducted at Idaho
Technology demonstrate that the use of Baker’s Yeast may be considered as a surrogate
control for monitoring extraction/purification of the FLOW and/or SWIPE components.
Bakers Yeast is readily available, does not pose a biosafety risk and has a cell-wall, making it
a suitable sample purification control for purification of samples containing B. anthracis. In
addition, ITI provides a Training kit that contains freeze-dried reagents for detecting yeast
DNA.
