L. Test Principle:
In the presence of Tion-NAD, the enzyme 3-α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3-
α-HSD) converts bile acids to 3-keto steroids and Thio-NADH. The reaction is
reversible and 3-α-HSD can convert 3-keto steroids and Thio-NADH to bile acids
and Thio-NAD. In the presence of excess NADH, the enzyme cycling occurs
efficiently and the rate of formation of Thio-NADH is determined by measuring
specific change of absorbance at 405nm.
The assay mechanism is shown below:

d. Detection limit:
To demonstrate the limit of quantification of the total bile acid measurement by the
Diazyme TBA Enzymatic Assay, test sample with bile acids of 10 µΜ was diluted with
Solution A to obtain the sample concentrations of 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.5 µΜ. The limit of
quantification is defined as the lowest concentration having a CV < 15%. The samples
were analyzed by the Diazyme TBA Enzymatic Assay by eight replicates.
Sample type: human serum dilution with 50mM MES buffer
Target concentrations/range: 1-6
Number of measurements per concentration: 8
Solution A: 50 mM MES buffer, pH 6.0

e. Analytical specificity:
To study the effect of potential interferences in the Diazyme TBA Enzymatic assay,
agents like bilirubin, hemoglobin, triglyceride, and ascorbic acid were spiked into normal
human serum to be used as samples. In this study, 3 replicates of each agent were
evaluated.
% interference is calculated using the following equation:
Spiked sample – non-spiked sample X 100 = % interference
Non-spiked sample
Acceptance criteria: calculated % interference must be less than 5%
Interference Agents:
1. To study the effect of bilirubin on the bile acid measurement, a serum sample
with bile acid level of 22 µM, was spiked with bilirubin to achieve bilirubin
serum level of 50 mg/dL. This concentration is in addition to the bilirubin
concentration found in the normal serum sample.
2. To study the effect of hemoglobin on the bile acid measurement, a serum sample
with bile acid level of 22 µM, was spiked with hemoglobin to achieve a
hemoglobin serum level of 500 mg/dL. This concentration is in addition to the
hemoglobin concentration found in the normal serum sample.
3. To study the effect of ascorbic acid on the bile acid measurement, a serum sample
with bile acid level of 22 µM, were spiked with ascorbic acid to achieve serum
level of 50 mg/dL. This concentration is in addition to the ascorbic acid
concentration found in the normal serum sample.
4. To study the effect of lipid on the bile acid measurement, a serum sample with
bile acid level of 22 µM, was spiked with lipid to achieve lipid serum level of 750
mg/dL. This concentration is in addition to the lipid concentration found in the
normal serum sample.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The accuracy study comparing the Diazyme Total Bile Assay with the Predicate
Trinity’ s Bile Acid method presented a slope of 1.15, correlation coefficient 0.99,
and y intercept of 0.89. I felt the 15% bias compared to the predicate device was
an issue because the Diazyme method did not show good correlation with the
predicate device in the normal expected range of 0-10 µM.
There were 8 samples (sample # 4, 5, 6, 8, 14, 16, 19, and 23 in the correlation
data list) whose TBA values were significantly different from the values
determined by the predicate method. The sponsor indicated that they were aware
of this discrepancy and additional studies were performed. The sponsor came to
the conclusion that the discrepancies noted were not caused by the inaccuracy of
the Diazyme TBA method but was because of the poor anti-interference capacity
and low sensitivity of the NBT/formazan based predicate method.
The sponsor presented the following 5 points to demonstrate that the new
enzymatic cycling based total bile acids assay gives more accurate results for
lipemic and hemolytic samples than does the predicate method.
1. Difference in assay mechanisms: enzyme cycling versus non-cycling and rate
assay versus end point assay.

It is well known that there are two major drawbacks of the enzymatic, colorimetric bile
acids assay method (the predicate method) using nitro blue tetrazolium as color indicator
coupled with NAD. One is low sensitivity and the other is significant interferences from
hemolytic and lipemic serum samples. The assay mechanism of the predicate method is
depicted as below:
3HO-bile acids + NAD+ 3a-SHD 3-Oxo-bile acids + NADH + H+
NADH + H+ + tetrazolium salt diaphorase NAD + formazan (540 nm)
To overcome these drawbacks of the NBT/formazan based enzymatic bile acids assay, a
more sensitive and high capacity of anti-interference method has been developed. This
new method (the Diazyme method) utilizes an enzyme cycling based mechanism that
allows each bile acid molecule in the patient serum to produce multiple molecules of
Thio-NADH for detection. Through repeatedly oxidation and reduction reaction cycles,
the indicator Thio-NADH is significantly amplified. This rate based assay significantly
reduced lipemic and hemolytic interferences in comparison with the end point based
predicate assay. The assay mechanism is shown below:
Thio-NAD+ Thio-NADH
3HO-bile acids 3a-SHD 3-Oxo-bile acids
NAD+ NADH
2. Drawbacks of the predicate method described in the literatures
The two major drawbacks, low sensitivity and significant interferences by lipemic
and hemolytic samples are well documented in the literatures. For example, in Ueda
et al’s 1994 patent (U.S. 5,286,627), it is described that the enzymatic colorimetric
total bile acids assay (the predicate method) is liable to be influenced by bilirubin,
and is low sensitivity (see the attachment #1).
In another literature published in 1991 in the Journal of bioluminescence and
chemiluminescence, Lekhakula et al described a discrepancy of total bile acids levels
determined by two different methods. Lekhakula found that the BNT method
(predicate method) gave 4 times higher TBA values for those hypertriglyceridemic
and hypercholesterolemic sera (see the attachment #2). This observation was similar
to what Diazyme has observed.
3. Direct interference comparison between the enzyme cycling method and the
predicate method
Diagnostic Chemicals Limited (DCL), a Canada based major clinical diagnostic
reagent company who currently distribute Diazyme’s total bile acids reagent in U.S.
11

--- Page 12 ---
has made a head to head comparison of interferences by hemoglobin and triglycerides
on TBA assays. As shown in the attachment #3, the predicate method is significantly
affected by hemoglobin and triglycerides. The former causes under estimation of
TBA value whereas the later causes over estimation of TBA values. In contrast, the
enzyme cycling method is not significantly affected by both hemoglobin and
triglycerides
4. The cause of the discrepancy was confirmed experimentally
We measured the triglycerides and hemoglobin contents of the 8 problematic serum
samples, and found that all the samples showed higher TBA values in the predicate
method were lipemic samples and all the samples showed lower TBA values in the
predicate method were the hemolytic samples as shown in the table below. These
observations are consistent with the literature descriptions and DCL’s experimental
findings.
