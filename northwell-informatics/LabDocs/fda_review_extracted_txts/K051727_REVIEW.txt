L. Test Principle:
Glucose: The assay for glucose is based on the enzymatic glucose oxidase/peroxidase
(GOD/POD) method. Glucose oxidase catalyzes the formation of gluconic acid and
hydrogen peroxide from the oxidation of glucose. A second enzyme, peroxidase,
catalyzes the reactions of hydrogen peroxidase with a potassium iodide chromogen to
oxidize the chromogen to colors ranging from green to blue.
Bilirubin: The test is based on the coupling of bilirubin with diazotized

dichloroaniline in a strongly acid medium. The color produced on the reagent pad
ranges through various shades of beige or tan.
Ketone: The test is based on the reaction between acetoacetate and sodium
nitroprusside in an alkaline medium. A positive result produces a violet color.
Specific Gravity: The test is based on the release of protons in the presence of cations.
The reaction produces hydrogenous ionogen, which reacts with a pH indicator that
causes a color change.
Blood: This test is based on the peroxidase activity of hemoglobin and myoglobin
creating a green color with oxidation of a chromogen. Intact erythrocytes which
hemolyze on the test paper will produce a green dot.
pH: This test is based on the indicators methyl red and bromthymol blue that give a
broad range of colors covering the entire urinary pH range.
Protein: The test is based on the protein-error-of-indicators principle. Anions in the
specific pH indicator attracted by cations on protein molecules make the indicator
further ionized, which changes its color. A positive reaction is indicated by a color
change from yellow to light green to darker greens.
Urobilinogen: The test is based on the Ehrlich reaction in which p-diethylamino
benzaldehyde in conjunction with a color enhancer reacts with urobilinogen in a
strong acid medium. A positive reaction is indicated by a light pink to pink color.
Nitrite: The test is based on the conversion of nitrate to nitrite. The nitrate in the urine
and aromatic amino sulphanilamide are diazotized to form a diazonium compound.
The diazonium compound reacting with tetrahydro benzo(h) quinolin 3-phenol causes
the color change. A positive reaction is indicated by a light pink to pink color.
Leukocytes: The test is based on the reaction of esterases, present in granulocytic
leukocytes, which catalyze the hydrolysis of an indoxylcarbonic acid ester to indoxyl.
A positive reaction is indicated by a light purple to dark purple color.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Studies to assess the reproducibility of AimStick Urine Reagent Strips were

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability studies are performed using two levels of commercially marketed
urinalysis controls. The results of the study support the claim that the product
is stable at room temperature for 18 months.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor validates the sensitivity range of the AimStick Urine Reagent
Strips by testing negative urine samples on a commercially available urine
chemistry analyzer. Each urine sample is tested with three lot numbers of the
AimStick Urine Reagent Strips. Each test is repeated 20 times with each lot
number. The results of the studies supporting the sponsor’s sensitivity claims
are described below.
Glucose:
Negative urine samples are spiked with glucose at concentrations of 0, 50, 72
and 100 mg/dL. The results obtained from the study demonstrate a sensitivity
of 50-100 mg/dL. The reagent pad does not react with lactose, galactose, or
fructose.
Blood:
Negative urine samples are spiked with erythrocytes from venous blood. at
concentrations of 0, 5, 10, 15 and 21 Cells/μL. The results obtained from the
study demonstrate a sensitivity of 5-15 RBCs. (10 lysed RBCs is equivalent to
0.3 mg/dL of hemoglobin).
Bilirubin
Negative urine samples are spiked with bilirubin at concentrations of 0, 0.2,
0.3 and 0.5 mg/dL. The results obtained from the study demonstrate a
sensitivity of 0.2-0.5 mg/dL.

Ketone:
Negative urine samples are spiked with acetoacetic acid at concentrations of 0,
5, 10, and 15 mg/dL. The results obtained from the study demonstrate a
sensitivity of 5-10 mg/dL.
Protein
Negative urine samples are spiked with human albumin at concentrations of 0,
12, 15, 24 and 30 mg/dL. The results obtained from the study demonstrate a
sensitivity of 15-30 mg/dL.
Urobilinogen:
Negative urine samples are spiked with urobilinogen at concentrations of 0,
0.2, 0.7, and 1.0 mg/dL. The results obtained from the study demonstrate a
sensitivity of 0.2-1.0 mg/dL.
Nitrite:
Negative urine samples are spiked with nitrite at concentrations of 0, 0.09,
0.124, and 0.152 mg/dL. The results obtained from the study demonstrate a
sensitivity of 0.09-0.52 mg/dL.
Leukocytes:
A urine sample with a high concentration of leukocytes is diluted with
negative urine to produce three concentration levels-0, 5, 15, and 25 Cells/μL.
The results obtained from the study demonstrate a sensitivity of 5-15
Cells/μL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Artificial urine is spiked with the following twenty seven possible interfering
substances, one at a time. Each spiked urine sample is tested five times with the
AimStick Urine Reagent Strips. None of the substances at the concentration
tested interfered with the AimStick Urine Reagent Strips. The results are
presented in the table below.
