K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced
L. Test Principle:
The DRG Salivary Cortisol ELIA KIT is based on the competitive principle and the
microplate separation. An unknown amount of Cortisol present in the sample and a fixed
amount of Cortisol conjugated with horse-radish peroxidase compete for the binding sites
of rabbit polyclonal Cortisol-antiserum coated onto the wells. After one hour incubation
the microplate is washed to stop the competition reaction. After addition of the substrate
solution the concentration of Cortisol is inversely proportional to the optical density
measured.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The Intra-Assay variation was determined by replicate measurements of 4 saliva samples
using DRG ELISA kit. The within assay variation is shown below:
Sample 1 Sample 2 Sample 3 Sample 4
Mean (ng/mL) 3.21 ng/mL 19.09 ng/mL 32.51 ng/mL 1.19 ng/mL
SD 0.188 1.085 1.806 0.083
CV (%) 5.85 5.68 5.55 6.96
n = 20 20 20 20
The Inter-Assay (between-run) variation was determined by quadruplicate measurements
of commercial control samples in three different day runs. The inter-assay variation is
shown below:
Mean 24.29 ng/mL 40.85 ng/mL
SD 1.81 ng/mL 2.38 ng/mL
CV (%) 7.47 5.82
n = 12 12
The Inter-Lot (between-lot) variation was determined by duplicate measurements of five
saliva samples in three different kit lots. The between run variability is shown below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Three samples (saliva) containing different amounts of analyte were serially
diluted 1:16 with zero standard and assayed with the DRG ELISA. The
percentage recovery was calculated by comparing the expected and measured
values for the SLV cortisol. An assay linearity of 1.04 – 77 ng/mL has been
identified as the usable range. Samples above this range must be diluted and
re-run.

Average 107 99.1 97.5
Recovery %
Range of from 101.1 97.8 90.8
Recovery % To 114.1 99.6 104.4
The Linearity study has been expanded to include additional higher samples to
yield an upper detection level. As can be seen in the Table below the test is
linear through to the highest Calibrator. Previous data demonstrated the
lowest level of detectability.
Upper Linearity Study
In order to identify the upper level of detectability, three (3) native saliva
samples, containing different amounts of analyte, were spiked with purified
cortisol to obtain a starting level (undiluted) around and above the highest
Calibrator. The spiked saliva were serially diluted with zero standard and
assayed to determine upper end of detectability with the DRG ELISA. The
percentage recovery was calculated by comparing the expected and measured
values for SLV cortisol.
Percentage recovery is calculated as follows:
Measured values x 100

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
The calibrators are buffer based (artificial saliva matrix). The calibrators
were prepared by appropriate dilution from the maximum standard
(Smax.: 80 ng/mL). The Cortisol for the Calibrators was purchased from a
commercially available source and is weighed in to make the 80 ng/mL.
The reference values (calibrators/controls) were established using (Gas
chromatography-mass spectrophotometry) methods as per the guidelines

compounds listed in the table.
The cross reactivity is defined as:
Concentration of cortisol at 50% B/BO x 100

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Two studies were performed to evaluate the performance of the SLV Cortisol
Saliva ELISA versus two commercially available saliva Cortisol kits.
One study evaluated saliva samples from 41 male and female subjects between
ages 40 – 70 years. The samples were run in duplicate on the DRG test and
another commercially available LIA method to determine the concentration of
Cortisol in the samples. An overall correlation of 0.9876 and a regression
formula of y = 0.9726x + 0.095 was obtained versus this method. The samples
ranged in concentration from 3.10 to 13.01 ng/mL.
A second study was performed using 30 saliva samples collected from men and
women ages 40 – 65 years and run in duplicate on DRG and another
commercially available EIA test. A correlation of 0.95742 with a regression
formula of y = 0.9812x + 0.1515 was observed. The samples ranged in
concentration from < 0.5 to 11.86 ng/mL.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
109 saliva samples from apparently health adult male and female subjects,
ranging in age from 20 to 80 years were collected in the morning and analyzed
using the DRG SLV Cortisol ELISA kit. The salivary cortisol concentration did
not show any significant differences based on age. Hence the normal range was
calculated for the entire group. The normal range of salivary cortisol analyzed
using DRG SLV Cortisol ELISA Test.
Adults: 0.12 – 1.47 µg/dL or 1.2 – 14.7 ng/mL (AM collection)
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
