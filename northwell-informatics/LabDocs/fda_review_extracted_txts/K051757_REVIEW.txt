M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run precision was assessed by measuring two levels of commercially
available control sera, two levels of commercially available urine controls,
and two concentrations of laboratory-prepared plasma. Each material was
assayed 20 times:
Matrix Conc. Level (mg/dL) Standard CV(%)
Deviation (mg/dL)
Serum Control 9.0 0.05 0.5%
11.9 0.06 0.5%
Urine Control 5.3 0.07 1.3%
11.3 0.11 1.0%
Plasma 8.9 0.06 0.6%
14.8 0.12 0.8%
Between run precision was assessed by measuring two samples per run, two
runs per day for twenty days for each matrix material:
Matrix Conc. Level (mg/dL) Standard CV(%)
Deviation (mg/dL)
Serum Control 9.0 0.11 1.2%
12.1 0.17 1.4%
Urine Control 5.3 0.08 1.6%
11.4 0.18 1.6%
Plasma 8.7 0.1 1.1%
14.3 0.15 1.1%
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linear range for this assay is 0.2 – 20 mg/dL Ca.
The lower limit of the assay range was established following EP17-A. The
company opted to apply a requirement of 3 standard deviations above their
blank value as their lower limit of detection. This criterion corresponded to a
concentration of 0.2 mg/dL total Ca.

To determine the upper limit of the linear range of this assay, the company
used an Allowable Total Error of 1.0 mg/dL Ca, the HCFA limit for
proficiency testing, and a systematic error budget of 33%. This gave an
Allowable Systematic Error of 0.3 mg/dL. The residuals were calculated as
the difference between the mean measured value and the estimated value
obtained by linear regression. If the absolute value of the residual was less
than the Allowable Systematic Error, the sample was considered to be within
the linear range of the assay. The results of this analysis supported a linear
range in excess of 20 mg/dL. The company rounded down to 20 mg/dL Ca as
the upper limit of this assay.
For samples with concentrations above 20 mg/dL, the company recommends
diluting the samples with saline.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The stability (shelf life) of the reagent was determined from accelerated aging
studies. Aging of the product at 37 °C for 7 days induced a 2.5% variance in
the performance of the product. Aging of the product at 37 °C for 7 days,
followed by subsequent storage at 50 °C for 7 days, induced at 2.7% variance
in the performance of the product. These observations support the claimed
shelf life of two years.
d. Detection limit:
The lower limit of the assay range was established following EP17-A. The
company opted to apply a requirement of 3 standard deviations above their
blank value as their lower limit of detection. This criterion corresponded to a
concentration of 0.2 mg/dL total Ca.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were conducted according to CLSI EP07-A: Interference
Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Proposed Guideline. Each potential interferent
was tested once. At the concentrations in the table below the interferents
induced less than a 10% variation in total Ca in urine, serum, and plasma
samples in the clinically relevant concentration range.
Interfering Species Concentration (mg/dL)
Lipemia 1000 mg/dL
Bilirubin 40 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 1000 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid 3000 mg/dL

Bilirubin	40 mg/dL
Hemoglobin	1000 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid	3000 mg/dL

In addition, the company tested potential cation interference in serum, finding
the cations in the table below would induce less than a 10% variation in total
Ca for measurements made on samples in the clinically relevant concentration
range:
Interfering Species Concentration (mg/dL)
Cu+2 6.4
Mn+2 0.55
Mg+2 12.6
Sr+2 43.8
Zn+2 0.65
MRI contrast agents
Gadodiamide (Gd-DTPA-BMA) 14.4
Gadoversetamide (MP-1177) 16.5
Finally, the company demonstrated that the assay was linear in the presence of
6 g/dL Albumin following the procedure outlined in the “Linearity/assay
reportable range”, above.
The company determined that anti-coagulants that complex calcium – citric
acid, oxalates, EDTA, and NaF – would interfere with this assay. These
agents should not be used on samples intended for measurement with this
device.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable to this type of device.
