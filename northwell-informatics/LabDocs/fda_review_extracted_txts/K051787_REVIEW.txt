H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The BNP test system is an in vitro diagnostic device intended to measure BNP in
whole blood and plasma.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Triage BNP Test is a rapid, point of care fluorescence immunoassay to be
used with the Triage Meter or Triage MeterPlus for the quantitative measurement
of B-Type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) in EDTA anti-coagulated whole blood or
plasma specimens. The test is intended to be used as an aid in the:
• Diagnosis of heart failure
• Assessment of heart failure severity
• Risk stratification of patients with acute coronary syndromes
• Risk stratification of patients with heart failure
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The device is for prescription use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Triage Meter or Triage MeterPlus
I. Device Description:
The Triage BNP Test is a ready-to-use, single use device. All reagents necessary to
run the test are contained within the device. The device contains anti-BNP
monoclonal antibodies (mouse) and anti-BNP polyclonal antibodies labeled with a
fluorescent dye and immobilizied on a solid phase and stabilizers.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Triage® BNP Test
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
de novo classified as Class II (k003475)

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Not applicable
L. Test Principle:
The Triage BNP Test is a single-use fluorescence immunoassay designed to
determine the concentration of BNP EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood or plasma
specimens. The specimen is added to the sample port of the test device with a
transfer pipette that is designed to deliver the appropriate amount of sample. After the
specimen is added, the device is inserted into the Triage Meter. The meter is
programmed to automatically perform the BNP analysis after the sample has reacted
with the reagents within the BNP device. The reaction and analysis time take about
15 minutes. The BNP measurement is based on the amount of fluorescence the meter
detects within the measurement zone of the device. A greater amount of fluorescence
detected by the meter indicates a higher amount of BNP in the specimen.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
In support of the new intended use, the sponsor provided five peer-reviewed
articles from the scientific literature assessing the clinical utility of BNP
measurements as an aid in the risk stratification of patients with heart failure.
All five studies utilized the Biosite Triage BNP device in their test method.
In one additional paper titled “How well does B-type natriuretic peptide
predict death and cardiac events in patients with heart failure: systematic
review,” J.A. Doust et al. (British Medical Journal, volume 330, 19 March
2005) performed a systematic evidence-based medicine review of the
literature. The review included 24 studies in all. While the review included
studies with various study designs and test methods (BNP and NT-proBNP),
the five articles previously mentioned were part of the review. The authors
concluded that BNP was a strong prognostic indicator for patients with heart
failure.
All literature references are cited in the sponsor’s labeling.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Previously demonstrated for k021317 and k032235. The data/information is

5. Expected values/Reference range:

N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
