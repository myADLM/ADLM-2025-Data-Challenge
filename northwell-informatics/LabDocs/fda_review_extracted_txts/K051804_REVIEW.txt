Refer to Indications for Use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
The ABL80 FLEX is a portable, automated system that measures pH, blood
gases, electrolytes, glucose, and hematocrit in whole blood. The ABL80
FLEX system is intended for use by trained technologists, nurses, physicians
and therapists. It is intended for use in a laboratory environment, near patient
or point-of-care setting. These tests are only performed under a physicians
order:
pH: pH is the indispensable measure of acidemia or alkalemia and is therefore
an essential part of the pH/Blood gas measurement.
pO : The arterial oxygen tension is an indicator of the oxygen uptake in the
2
lungs.
pCO : pCO is a direct reflection of the adequacy of alveolar ventilation in
2 2
relation to the metabolic rate.
Potassium (cK+): The potassium level is the predominant intracellular cation.
It is fundamental for correct neuromuscular activity.
Sodium (cNa+): The sodium ion is the most abundant cation in plasma. It is
the foremost agent involved in maintenance of osmolality and body fluid
volumes.
Calcium (cCa2+): The calcium ion is the most abundant mineral element in
the human body and is involved in numerous enzymatic processes, blood
coagulation, cell growth, and membrane transport mechanisms as well as
plays an important role in nervous impulse conduction, neuromuscular
transmission, and muscular contraction and relaxation.
Chloride (cCl-): The chloride ion is the main extracellular anion and plays an
important role in maintaining electrical neutrality.
Hematocrit (Hct): The hematocrit measurement is the ratio of the volume of
red blood cells in whole blood in comparison to the total volume.
Glucose (cGlu): The glucose measurements are used to screen for, diagnose
and monitor glycemic levels in potential pre-diabetic, diabetic, hypoglycemic
patients.
3. Special condition for use statement(s):
For prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:

L. Test Principle:
There are three different measuring principles employed.
Potentiometry: A potential is recorded using a voltmeter, which relates to the
concentration of the sample. A reference electrode is used to provide a stable, fixed
potential against which other potential differences can be measured. This
measurement technique is used for pH, pCO and electrolytes.
2
Amperometry: The magnitude of an electrical flow of current is proportional to the
concentration of the substance being oxidized or reduced at an electrode. This
measurement technique is used for pO and Glucose.
2
Conductivity: The specific impedance of a sample as measured by two conducting
electrodes held at a constant voltage is directly proportional to the conductive
properties of the sample. This technique is used for hematocrit and air-in-sample
detection.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility
The precision study was performed using 5 ABL80 analyzers.
Samples used for testing were heparinized blood samples from
healthy, voluntary donors. The blood was prepared to obtain high,
mid, and low concentration levels of each measured parameter. For
pH, pCO and pO , the blood was tonometered with certified gas
2 2
mixtures traceable to NIST to attain test levels. For sodium,
potassium, calcium, chloride, and glucose, the blood sample was
spiked with concentrated stock solution of analyte or diluted to
adjust analyte level. For hematocrit, the plasma volume of the
sample was adjusted to attain test levels. Five replicates per level and
analyte were measured on each ABL80. The test was repeated for
each of 3 days. The total number of samples tested was 75 per
analyte level.
Precision is a measure of the standard deviation (SD) of results from
repeated measurements within a short interval of time using: the
same instrument and location, the same measurement procedure,
identical portions of the same sample, and one operator per
instrument. The standard deviationfor eachlevel is pooled for all
test instruments and test days
Below are listed tables showing SD and %CV for the parameters of
the ABL80 analyzer: For comparison, SDis also shown for the
ABL77 for pH, pCO , pO , Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl-, and Hct and for the

The ABL80 demonstrated bias equivalent to that of currently
marketed instruments, the ABL77 and ABL725.
The assay reportable range was chosen to include high, normal and
low values for each parameter based on clinical decision points. To
achieve these levels, blood from normal human donors was
adjusted per internal standard operating procedures. These
procedures include tonometry with reference gas mixtures to
obtain varying blood levels for pH, pCO2 and pO2, and plasma
spiking to obtain varying hematocrit, glucose and electrolyte
levels. Results for the assay reportable range are summarized
below.

solution calibration/QC pack similar to the cal pack currently used in
the ABL77 analyzer. This new cal pack contains four pouches of
liquid solutions, each from an independent manufacturing lot. Each
of the four solutions contains varying concentrations of each
measured analyte. The exact formulations are chosen and the
measurements analyzed in a coordinated system to provide a low,
normal, and high clinical value for each measured parameter. The
range of values is similar to commercially available external QC
ampoule systems.
During each automatic cycle, all four solutions are analyzed. The
results of these measurements are used to calculate calibration values
and QC results for all parameters. For each parameter, two of the
solution measurement results are used to calculate a value for that
parameter. This value is then used to calculate a quality control
result from the measurement of a third solution analyzed in the same
cycle. This QC result is compared to acceptable ranges established at
the time of manufacturing of the solution pouch.
At manufacture, the pouch solutions are tested on a reference
analyzer to obtain the known values for each solution and analyte.
These target values and acceptance range spans are stored on a cal
pack smart chip and are read into ABL80 analyzer memory at the
time of cal pack installation. The acceptance range for each solution
is calculated by the system software from the values read from the
smart chip. In use, the four solutions are pumped into the sensor
flow cell in succession such as L4 – L3 – L2 – L 1. After each
solution is pumped, stability endpoints are saved and then the next
solution is pumped. From known solution analyte concentrations
and stability endpoints, calibration and QC results are calculated
using different combinations of solution endpoints. All levels of QC
are calculated at each calibration/QC interval. Calibration and
quality control reagents package, Calpack, shelf life is 3 months
from date of manufacture.
d. Detection limit:
Detection limits for the ABL80 FLEX are defined as the linear range
of each assay. As part of the whole blood method comparison
testing minimum and maximum test values were obtained. The
minimum values obtained for each tested parameter are near the
limit of detection for the system.

o The method comparison for pH, sodium, potassium, calcium,
and chloride was against ABL725 analyzers.
o The method comparison for blood gases (pCO and pO ) was
2 2
against tonometry. Blood gas target values were calculated
from certified tonometry gas mixtures traceable to NIST.
o The method comparison for glucose was against serum
standard per CLSI Publication RS1-A.
o The method comparison for hematocrit was against the
microhematocrit method using centrifugation per CLSI
standard H7-A3. The blood samples used for testing are
heparinized blood samples from healthy, voluntary donors.
Blood samples were prepared to obtain the different
concentration levels of each measured parameter. Measurements
of every parameter were taken on the analyzers with 5 samples
tested per level. Each sample was split between the ABL80 and
reference/method. The results from these tests are summarized as
following:
· pH, ABL 80 / ABL725: y = 0.998x + 0.023 R = 1.00 n = 25
· pCO ABL80 / Target Value: y = 0.995x+ 0.229, R = 1.00 n = 25

· pO , ABL80 / Target Value: y = 1.030x – 4.004 R = 1.000 n = 25

· cNa+ ABL 80 / ABL 725: y = 1.016x - 2.461 R = 0.999 n = 15
· cK+, ABL 90 / ABL 725: y = 1.014x + 0.111 R = 1.000 n = 15
· cCa2+, ABL80/ABL725: y = 1.001x - 0.008 R= 0.999 n = 15
· cCl-, ABL 80 / ABL 725: y = 1.010x - 1.484 R = 0.999 n = 15
· Glu, ABL 80 / Serum Standard : y = 0.9994x - 0.013 R = 1.000 n
= 15
· Hct, ABL 80 / Spun: y = 1.021x – 0.489 R = 0.999 n = 25

Method comparison shows good agreement between the ABL80
and comparative method. Results from linear regression analysis
of the data show slopes ranging from 0.994 – 1.030 and correlation
ranging from 0.999 – 1.000.
b. Matrix comparison:
The ABL 80 FLEX utilizes the same sample types as the previously
cleared on the predicate device.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a and b are not applicable):
Point-of-care studies were conducted to assess the reproducibility of
sample measurement in the ABL80 when samples are performed by
end-users in the point-of-care area.
The method used for this study was repeat measurements on several
levels of aqueous samples in analysis mode. There were 20 samples
of unlabeled ampoules consisting of 5 ampoules of each of 4 levels.
Each ampoule was chosen at random and analyzed once.
This study was performed in-house at SenDx Medical Inc. and at
three field sites. The in-house user was experienced with performing
sample measurements on the ABL80. The field site users had no
previous experience with the ABL80.
Results from each site were tabulated separately. The mean,
standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variance (% CV) were
calculated for each test level and parameter. The data were not
pooled due to small biases between sites. The biases are largely due
to the nature of the test samples. The test samples were aqueous
quality control materials packaged in glass ampoules with an
included gas phase. The gas phase produces a temperature
dependency of the gas tensions and pH which, if not equilibrated to
the same temperature at each site, will produce small biases of the
gas and pH measurements between sites due to the temperature
differences at the test sites. Also, because the test samples were
aqueous control materials run in the sample analysis mode of the
analyzer, small carry over effects were noted between sites which
contributed to the inter-site biases. Results from the Point-of-care
study are summarized in the following tables:

Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
In the labeling the sponsor states: "Reference ranges are valuable guidelines
for the clinician, but they should not be regarded as absolute indicators of
health and disease. Reference ranges should be used with caution since values
for 'healthy' individuals often overlap significantly with values for persons
afflicted with disease. In addition, laboratory values may vary significantly
due to methodological differences and mode of standardization" Reference:
Siggaard-Andersen O, Thode J, Wandrup JH. The concentration of free
calcium ions in the blood plasma ionized calcium. In: Siggaard-Andersen O,
ed. Proceedings of the IFCC expert panel on pH and blood gases held at
Herlev Hospital 1980. Copenhagen: Radiometer Medical A/S, 1981: 163-90.”.
The reference ranges given in this section are mainly taken from above
reference. In some cases the values are taken from other sources marked by
their reference number.
“When possible the reference ranges for arterial blood have been listed.
Reference ranges must be used with caution as they depend on a number of
factors, such as sex, age, and normal physiological condition.”

Conductance: Hematocrit
4. Calibration:
The ABL 80 analyzer is equipped with solution pack which contains
tonometered fluids. A 2-point calibration is performed at preset intervals using
solution 1 and solution 2 from the solution pack. The precise vales for these
solutions ae recorded in the smart chip on the solution pack.
5. Quality Control:
External quality control samples were tested on ABL80 FLEX each test day. In
addition, internal quality control solutions were tested. These internal quality
