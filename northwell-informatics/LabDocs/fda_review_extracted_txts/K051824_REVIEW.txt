The information provided from this test may supplement therapeutic decision-making and should
only be used in conjunction with routine monitoring by a physician. Because of the variability in
the knowledge of clinical utility with certain drugs that are metabolized by UGT1A1, clinicians
should use professional judgment in the interpretation of results from this type of test. The
Invader® UGT1A1 Molecular Assay should not be used: 1) as the only test to determine specific
drug dose. Other clinical information and patient history should primarily be considered, 2) to
aid in predicting a patient’s drug response for drugs that are not metabolized by the enzyme
encoded by UGT1A1, and 3) to aid in predicting a patient’s response to drugs for which the
mutant UGT1A1 phenotype has not been clearly established.

I. Device Description:
The Invader® UGT1A1 Molecular Assay is an in vitro diagnostic test that utilizes sequence-specific
DNA probes, a structure-specific cleavage enzyme and a universal fluorescent resonance energy
transfer (FRET) system combined with interpretative software and third party microtiter plate reader
instrumentation. The assay is designed to identify specific nucleic acid sequences and query for the
presence of known sequence polymorphisms through analysis of structure-specific cleavage of a
series of probes that are specifically complementary either to wild type or mutant sequences of the
“TATA Box” promoter region of the UGT1A1 *1 (TA6) and *28 alleles (TA7) of the UDP
glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) gene.

L. Test Principle:
The Invader® UGT1A1 Molecular Assay permits the analysis of specific nucleic acid sequences and
a query for the presence of known sequence polymorphisms. The basis of the Invader assay is the
ability of an enzyme, provided with the test, to recognize and cleave specific structures formed by
the addition of two oligonucleotides. The two oligonucleotides, a discriminatory primary probe and
an invader probe, hybridize in tandem to the target DNA to an overlapping structure. The 5’-end of
the discriminatory probe includes a 5’-flap that does not hybridize to the target DNA. The 3’-
nucleotide of the bound invader probe overlaps the primary probe, but need not hybridize to the
target DNA. A specific enzyme (the cleavase enzyme) recognizes this overlapping structure and
cleaves off the unpaired 5’-flap of the discriminatory probe, releasing it into the buffer. The
discriminatory probe is designed to have a melting temperature close to the reaction temperature.
Thus, under the assay conditions, the discriminatory probe cycles on the target DNA isothermally.
This allows for multiple round of discriminatory probe cleavage for each target DNA, and therefore
to an amplification of the number of released 5’-flaps.
In a second reaction within the same reaction tube, each released 5’-flap can serve as an invader
oligonucleotide on a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) cassette to create another
overlapping structure that is recognized and cleaved by the same enzyme mentioned above (cleavase
enzyme). When the FRET cassette is cleaved, a fluorophore is separated from a quencher and
detectable fluorescence signal is generated. Similar to the initial reaction, the released 5’-flap and
FRET cassette cycle, results in amplified fluorescence signal. The initial and secondary reactions
run concurrently in the same well.
The biplex format of the assay enables simultaneous detection of two DNA sequences in a single
well. It allows the detection of the UGT1A1 genotype specified in the indication for use and an
alpha actin internal control in each well. The biplex format uses two different discriminatory
probes, each with a unique 5’-flap, and two different fluorescence resonance energy transfer
cassettes, each with a spectrally distinct fluorophore.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the Invader UGT1A1 Molecular Assay was evaluated with a panel of
®
20 blinded whole blood samples that represented UGT1A1 *1 (TA ) (n = 6), UGT1A1 *28
6/6
heterozygous (TA ) (n = 4), UGT1A1 *28 homozygous (TA ) (n = 4), and other genotypes
6/7 7/7
(n = 5), at a concentration of 100 to 700 ng per reaction. The testing was conducted at three
different sites, including two external sites and a laboratory at Third Wave Technologies Inc.
using one lot or reagents. The samples underwent DNA extraction (in triplicate) using the
Qiagen QIAamp DNA Extraction methodology. DNA from the samples underwent
subsequent Invader analysis at each site on each of five days. Each site utilized a different
fluorometer to determine the performance of the assay. The genotype of the different blood
samples was determined by bi-directional DNA sequence analysis. The results from this
study are summarized below:

all 3 replicates on day 5).
4Correct call rate for all runs is based on 883/900 genotype calls.
Correct genotype calls for UGT1A1 were obtained for 840/900 (93.3%) samples after the 1st
run. After retesting 49 samples, 43/49 were correctly identified after the 2nd run. The total
correct genotype calls for the combined first and second runs was 883/900 (98.1%). Nine
samples were mis-ordered in the reaction plate at site 1 on day 5. As a result, the 3 replicates
for each sample produced genotype results that were inconsistent with the bi-directional
sequencing result for those samples. Discrepancy resolution by sequencing of the template
in the original Invader® assay plates confirmed that the genotypes present in the assay wells
were consistent with the reported genotypes of the assay.
From the 49 invalid calls after the 1st run, 20 were due to an invalid “Positive Control”
result, 20 were due to an invalid “Negative Control” result, and the remaining nine were due
to “Low Signal” as a result. After retesting, 6 genotype reactions were still reported as “Low
Signal.”
Lot-to-Lot reproducibility:
Whole blood samples (n = 40) underwent DNA extraction and subsequent bi-directional
DNA sequence analysis. The same DNA samples were then analyzed using the Invader®
UGT1A1 Molecular Assay using three different lots of the reagents. The observed
agreement between all three lots of the Invader® UGT1A1 Molecular Assay and bi-

directional DNA sequencing was 100% (120/120). The 95% one-sided lower confidence
limit was 92.8%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Assay Shelf Life Stability: Archived genomic DNA samples representing UGT1A1*1,
UGT1A1*28 (heterozygous) and UGT1A1*28 (homozygous) genotypes were used for
testing. These samples were derived from whole blood samples anticoagulated with
tripotassium EDTA, subjected to genomic DNA extraction using the Qiagen QIAamp 96
Blood Kit method, and quantitated using the PicoGreen method. The DNA had been stored
at +4-8°C in AE buffer for ~3 months in a monitored refrigerator, according to Qiagen’s
recommended storage conditions. The stability of the Invader UGT1A1 Molecular Assay
®
was evaluated using three different lots of assay components. Each lot was tested for
Standard Storage conditions (unopened kit stored at -20°C until time of testing). The assay
demonstrated 100% agreement with bi-directional DNA sequencing genotypes up to the
expiration date of 30 days, when stored at -20ºC.
d. Detection limit:
Lower Limit of Detection: The lower limit of detection of the Invader®UGT1A1 Molecular
Assay was determined by analysis of dilutions of genomic DNA samples to 150, 100 and 50
ng DNA/reaction. Forty (40) replicates of genomic DNA samples representing the *1, *28
heterozygous, and *28 homozygous UGT1A1 alleles were tested and compared to bi-
directional DNA sequencing results. There was 100% agreement between the Invader®
UGT1A1 Molecular Assay and bi-directional DNA sequencing for all samples at each of
tested concentrations. The ability of the assay to detect UGT1A1 *1, UGT1A1 *28
(heterozygous) and UGT1A1*28 (homozygous) genotypes is not adversely affected by lower
than recommended patient sample DNA concentrations. The lower limit of patient sample
DNA is defined as 100 ng per reaction, or 10 ng/μL.
Upper Limit of Detection: The upper limit of detection of the Invader®UGT1A1 Molecular
Assay was determined by analysis of genomic DNA samples at 800 ng DNA/reaction. Forty
(40) replicates of genomic DNA samples representing the *1, *28 heterozygous, and *28
homozygous UGT1A1 alleles were tested at a concentration of 800 ng/reaction and
compared to bi-directional DNA sequencing results. There was 100% agreement between
the Invader® UGT1A1 Molecular Assay and bi-directional DNA sequencing demonstrating
the capability to accurately detect UGT1A1 TATA box sequences at DNA concentration
levels at the recommended upper DNA concentration limit of 700 ng per reaction, or 70
ng/µL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering Substances
The potentially interfering substances Bilirubin, Lipids, K2 EDTA, 5% Qiagen Buffer AW2,
1% Qiagen Buffer AW2, and Hemoglobin were either added to the blood sample or directly

to the purified genomic DNA, depending on the nature of the proposed interferent.
Compounds added to the blood samples include endogenous substances and those associated
with blood collection. Specifically, the substances included bilirubin, lipids, and dipotassium
EDTA. Bilirubin and lipids were added to blood samples to evaluate assay performance with
samples acquired from individuals with "high-test" levels of either substance. Dipotassium
EDTA was added to blood samples to represent an incomplete blood draw, resulting in an
increased amount of anticoagulant in the whole blood sample. Compounds that were added
directly to purified genomic DNA include Qiagen Buffer AW2 and hemoglobin. Buffer
AW2 was added directly to the purified DNA sample, to mimic the impact of incomplete
removal of residual wash buffer. While hemoglobin is endogenous to the original blood
sample, it was added to the purified DNA to determine its direct impact on assay
performance. Sixteen samples of known UGT1A1 genotype (as determined through bi-
directional DNA sequence analysis) underwent genomic DNA isolation using the Qiagen
QIAamp methodology, and were tested along with four subtractive blanks, two controls, and
a No Target Control (NTC). Interference was measured by calculation of percent agreement
of genotype calls between spiked and non-spiked samples. The sponsor reports that the
percent agreement of the genotype between the spiked and non-spiked samples varied
between 87.5% and 100%. The Invader® UGT1A1 Molecular Assay performance was not
adversely affected by higher than normal blood levels of bilirubin (5-fold, or 8 mg/dL) or
lipids (mono-, di-, and triglycerides, 2-fold, or 150 mg/dL). Hemoglobin (2-fold, or 0.025%)
or 1% residual Qiagen AW2 DNA extraction buffer also did not affect the assay. Decreased
performance was seen with DNA samples containing 5% residual Qiagen DNA extraction
AW2 buffer. 5% AW2 buffer resulted in 1 incorrect genotype call and 1 ˝low signal˝.

b. Matrix comparison:
Component Tolerance Study
Whole blood samples (n=20) anticoagulated with dipotassium EDTA were subjected to the
Qiagen QIAamp DNA extraction procedure. An aliquot of the DNA samples were tested
using the Invader® UGT1A1 Molecular Assay with non-standard reaction conditions by
manipulating the parameters of both sample and reagent volume addition to the reaction.
The reagents, Oligo Mix and the Enzyme-Buffer Mix, were manipulated separately. A
second aliquot of the DNA samples were PCR amplified and analyzed by bi-directional
sequencing to assign a reference genotype. Twenty genomic DNA samples, 2 sample
controls, and a NTC sample were tested in singlicate with each assay Oligo Mix. Four
Subtractive Water Blank (Blank) samples were also included on each plate. Standard reagent
and sample volumes and +/–10% or +/–20% of the standard sample or reagent volume were
added to the appropriate reaction mixes. One reaction mix condition was tested per plate.
The percent agreement of final calls between each non-standard and standard reaction
condition was determined by comparison of the Invader® UGT1A1 Molecular Assay result to
the genotype as confirmed using bi-directional DNA sequencing. The sponsor determined
100% agreement (86.1% at one sided 95% confidence lower limit) across all reagent and
sample manipulations between the reference genotypes and the Invader genotypes for the 20
samples tested. The Invader® UGT1A1 Molecular Assay performance was not adversely
affected by ±20% variation in reagent or sample volumes.
Freeze –Thaw Stability
The Freeze-Thaw Stability of the Invader® UGT1A1 DNA Assay was evaluated using
identical sets of assay components from a single lot. Whole blood samples (n=20)
anticoagulated with potassium EDTA were subjected to the Qiagen QIAamp DNA extraction
procedure and tested in singlicate using Invader® UGT1A1 DNA Assay kits that were
subjected to differing numbers of freeze thaw cycles (1, 3, 5, 10). Two controls and an NTC
sample were also included in the test sample set. Four Subtractive Water Blank (Blank)
samples were also included on each plate. For each freeze thaw cycle, all components were
stored at -20°C until frozen solid (excluding the Enzyme/Buffer mix which does not freeze
due to the presence of glycerol as an ingredient) and then thawed at room temperature until
liquid. The percent agreement of final calls between reagents subjected to each freeze thaw
cycle (3, 5, 10) and reagents subjected to 1 cycle (baseline) was determined. The sponsor
observed that the Invader® UGT1A1 Molecular Assay accurately detected each of the
UGT1A1 genotypes present in the test samples. Performance was not adversely affected
after being subjected to 10 freeze-thaw cycles, supporting the recommendation in the
package insert of no more than five (5) cycles. Agreement between the Invader® UGT1A1
Molecular Assay and the bi-directional DNA sequence comparison genotype was 100%.
The-sided 95% Confidence Lower Limit for the agreement of the 20 samples at each cycle
point (1, 3, 5, & 10 freeze-thaw cycles) was 86.1%.

Sample preparation Equivalency Study:
The performance of the Invader® UGT1A1 Molecular Assay was evaluated with samples
extracted with both the Qiagen QIAamp® 96 DNA Blood Kit and the Qiagen QIAamp® DNA
Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA). Sixty (60) human whole blood samples
anticoagulated with dipotassium EDTA, representing UGT1A1 *1 (TA ) (n = 13),
(6/6)
UGT1A1 *28 heterozygous (TA ) (n = 24), homozygous (TA )(n = 10), and other
(6/7) (7/7)
genotypes (n = 13). The listed genotypes were again established through bi-directional
sequence analysis, and were processed using both extraction methods. The resultant
genomic DNA samples from both extraction methods were tested in singlicate using the
Invader® UGT1A1 Molecular Assay. In addition to the processed blood samples, two
positive control samples, a No Target Control, and four Subtractive Blanks (Blank) were also
included on each plate. Genomic DNA from each sample was previously quantified by the
PicoGreen methodology (Molecular Probes-Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The ranges of
genomic DNA concentrations obtained from the two Qiagen QIAamp® extraction methods
were recorded and assessed for suitability for use in the Invader® UGT1A1 Molecular Assay.
Results: There was 100% agreement, with a 1-sided 95% confidence lower limit of 95.1%,
between the Invader® UGT1A1 Molecular Assay results obtained for each sample
preparation method on all 60 samples. The results demonstrate that either DNA
extraction/purification methodology provides genomic DNA samples suitable for use with
the Invader® UGT1A1 Molecular Assay. DNA concentrations ranged from 13 ng/µL to 78
ng/uL, covering most of the range of 10 – 70 ng/µL recommended in the package insert.
