I. Device Description:
The FreeStyle Freedom™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System is an electrochemical biosensor
consisting of a glucose-oxidizing enzyme on a disposable test strip (the electrochemical
sensor) and a hand-held current measuring device. Software internal to the hand-held device
converts the measured current into glucose concentration using an algorithm that depends on
the ambient temperature and the activity of the enzyme on the test strip. The user has the
ability to validate the operation of the system by using glucose control solutions provided
with the system.
The FreeStyle Freedom™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of a hand-held blood
glucose meter, test strips, and two levels of control materials. Each lot of test strips has a
code number implying lot-specific calibration. The strip characteristics associated with each
code number are pre-programmed and permanently stored in the hand-held meter.
The meter is turned on by strip insertion. The user must select a code number corresponding
to their vial of strips via the meter’s interface. After selecting the correct code, the user
applies blood or a drop of control solution to the strip. The meter completes the glucose
assay in 5 or more seconds. The meter’s software converts the charge read off the test strip
into a plasma glucose concentration and displays the value on the meter’s LCD screen. The
user has the ability to validate the operation of the system by using glucose control solutions
provided with the system.

The FreeStyle Freedom™ meter utilizes coulometric biosensor technology to quantify glucose
concentrations. Specifically, it correlates the total charge produced by the glucose oxidation
reaction to a glucose concentration. Since complete oxidation of glucose in a sample can take
in excess of 100 seconds, the total charge derived from the reaction is estimated from a
partial reaction profile.
A mediator molecule shuttles electrons between a glucose-oxidizing enzyme and the working
electrode on the strip. This rapid electron transport by the mediator maintains the enzyme in
an oxidized state capable of reacting with glucose. Unlike the predicate, the re-oxidation of
the mediator is accelerated and allows the glucose oxidation to proceed faster.
Software internal to the hand-held device uses the charge collected during the measurement
time and the measured ambient temperature to project an estimated time course for the
reaction. The software converts the estimate of the total amount of glucose to a
concentration which is then displayed to the user.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The company demonstrated the repeatability of their meter by performing within run
precision studies on venous blood. One venous blood sample was adjusted to five
different concentrations of glucose spanning the range claimed by the meter (20
mg/dL – 500 mg/dL). The company conducted the within-run precision study
following guidelines in ISO 15197 and CLSI EP5-A2. The YSI was used as the
reference standard for comparison. The company multiplied the YSI measurements
by 1.12 to determine the plasma equivalent glucose values.
For the within-meter, within-vial precision studies, the company made 10 replicate
measurements at each glucose concentration for each meter-vial pair. The company
used vials from 3 different manufacturing lots in this study. A summary of the results
is presented in the table below:

The average standard deviation for measurements made within the same lot of strips
at concentrations below 100 mg/dL was 3.3 mg/dL with a corresponding CV of 5.9%.
For measurements above 100 mg/dL, the average standard deviation for
measurements made within the same strip lot was 8.6 mg/dL with a corresponding
CV of 4.0%.
The company assessed their day-to-day precision using measurements on 3 different
concentrations of control solutions. The study involved 2 measurements per meter
per day for 20 days using 3 lots of strips. A summary of these measurements:
Average

High 328.6 10.8 11.6 12.8 11.7 3.6
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The company followed CLSI EP6-A in demonstrating the linear response of their
device. They adjusted the unpooled blood of three different donors to 9 different
YSI glucose concentrations. The average YSI glucose values obtained were as
follows: 28, 78, 140, 192, 265, 320, 376, 438, 489 mg/dL. Each concentration of
each blood sample was measured 3 times on 2 different lots of strips across 6 meters
for a total of 972 measurements. Readings from the YSI were scaled by 1.12 for
comparison. The proposed device demonstrated a linear relationship to the YSI with a
slope of 0.8266, intercept of 9.6057 and a r-squared value of 0.9909.
In the clinical studies using fresh capillary blood, a linear regression of fingerstick
measurements using the Freedom device vs. a YSI capillary fingerstick measurement
yielded a line with a slope of 0.971, an intercept of 8.620 mg/dL, and an r-value of
0.981. The samples ranged from 50 mg/dL to 500 mg/dL by the YSI method.
In the clinical studies using fresh venous blood, a linear regression of 198 venous
blood measurements using the Freedom device vs. a YSI venous measurement
yielded a line with a slope of 0.922, an intercept of 19.063 and an r-value of 0.994.
The samples ranged from 65 mg/dL to 490 mg/dL by the YSI method.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Data on expected values, traceability, and stability for the glucose control solutions
used with this device was supplied in a previous submission, k050500.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The company performed a clinical study to assess the ability of lay users to use the
device to measure their glucose. A total of 186 subjects divided across 3 sites
participated in the study. For each subject, the lay user performed a single finger
stick measurement. For comparison, a trained operator also performed a single finger
stick measurement. The trained operator also obtained additional fingerstick blood
for measurement by a YSI 2300 STAT Plus Blood Glucose analyzer. Measurements
on the YSI were performed twice. Six subjects were dropped from the subsequent
data evaluation. Four were dropped due to missing YSI reference measurements.
Two were excluded due to varying YSI reference measurements.
A linear least squares regression of the lay users’ measurements versus the YSI 2300
STAT reference had a slope of 0.92, an intercept of 14.3 mg/dL, and an r-value of
0.99. A linear least squares regression of the trained operator measurements versus
the YSI 2300 STAT reference had a slope of 0.95, an intercept of 12.9 mg/dL, and an
r-value of 0.97. A linear least squares regression of the lay user measurements using
the Freedom meter versus the trained operator measurements using the Freedom
meter had a slope of 0.97, an intercept of 2.7 mg/dL, and a r-value of 0.98.

The company conducted a clinical study to demonstrate the accuracy of meter when
used on the finger and forearm. 229 subjects in two sites participated in the study. A
total of 7 patients were dropped from the study due to deviations in protocol.
Measurements made by a medical technologist were compared to capillary and
venous YSI plasma results. Two different lots of strips were used at one site. Three
different lots of strips were used at the other. The level of testing varied at the two
sites. After exclusions, a total of 955 fingerstick measurements and 190
measurements of the forearm were performed. In addition, a venous blood sample
was obtained.
A linear regression of fingerstick measurements using the Freedom device vs. YSI
capillary fingerstick measurement yielded a line with a slope of 0.971, an intercept of
8.620 mg/dL, and an r-value of 0.981. The samples ranged from 50 mg/dL to 500
mg/dL by YSI method.
A linear regression of forearm measurements using the Freedom device on subjects
who had not eaten in more than 2 hours vs. YSI fingerstick measurement yielded a
line with a slope of 0.98, an intercept of 1.893 mg/dL, and an r-value of 0.97.
A linear regression of forearm measurements using the Freedom including subjects
who had recently eaten (72 of 190 forearm measurements) vs. YSI fingerstick
measurement yielded a line with a slope of 0.931, an intercept of 8.634 mg/dL, and an
r-value of 0.968.
A linear regression of 198 venous blood measurements using the Freedom device vs.
YSI venous measurement yielded a line with a slope of 0.922, an intercept of 19.063
and an r-value of 0.994.
The company tested the performance of their device on the alternate sites claimed in
their user manual. A YSI 2300 served as the reference method. After exclusions, 51
subjects participated in the trial. Subjects were tested by a technician first on a
fingertip, then palm, forearm, upper arm, calf, thigh, and then an additional finger tip.
For testing on the palm, participants were evenly divided for testing on the thenar
region and hypothenar region.
The company used a Passing Bablok regression to calculate the slope and intercept of
their alternate site data using scaled YSI measurements as a reference. The results of
this analysis is as follows:

Alternate Site Slope Intercept R-value N
Upper Arm 0.999 1.897 0.821 51
Thenar 1.056 -2.208 0.891 24
Forearm 1.067 -2.735 0.806 51
Hypothenar 1.069 -2.427 0.946 27
Thigh 1.154 -16.380 0.756 51

To evaluate the use of the back of the hand (base of the thumb and fore finger) as an
alternate site, glucose values from 52 subjects were compared to scaled YSI
measurements, ranging from 77 mg/dL to 246 mg/dL. 50/52 or 96% of the values
were within 20% of the scaled YSI values.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable for a device of this type.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The normal fasting glucose range for a non-diabetic adult is 70 to 110 mg/dL. (3.9 to 6.1
mmol/L)1. One to two hours after meals, normal glucose values should be less than 120
mg/dL (6.7 mm0l/L)2.

3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended for use with fresh capillary whole blood. Since the sample is
applied directly to the test strip there are no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
Each bottle of test strips has a code number which is used to calibrate the meter. The user
confirms that the code number on the test strip bottle matches the code number in the
instrument. If the bottle and meter codes do not match, the user must change the meter’s
code setting by depressing the “c” and “m” buttons on the meter until the correct number
is displayed. No further calibration is required of the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor provides two levels of glucose control solutions with this device. To mark a
test result as a control, the user depresses the “c” button on the meter for 2 seconds.
Measurements marked as a control are excluded from supplemental data analysis
supported by the meter (e.g., 14 day average glucose). An acceptable range of
measurement for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. If control results
fall outside these ranges, the user is referred to a list of troubleshooting steps and the
customer care line.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
The meter supports memory for storing 250 measurements and supplemental data analysis,
such as the 14 day average glucose concentration mentioned above. The user can program
the meter with up to 4 timed alarms. By inserting an interface cable into the meter, users can
download their measurement history to a personal computer. Verification and validation
information supplied by the company supports these performance claims.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
