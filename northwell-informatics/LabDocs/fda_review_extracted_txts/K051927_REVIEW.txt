EP7-A CLSI (NCCLS) Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry, Vol. 6 No.13
L. Test Principle:
The microwells are pre-coated with immobilized antigens of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. An aliquot of fecal specimen is emulsified in the diluent. The diluted
specimen, the ready to use positive control, and the 1X diluent negative control are
transferred to the microwell. If ASCA are present in the specimen, they will bind to
the immobilized antigens. After incubation, the wells are washed and the conjugate
added. The conjugate binds to the ASCA captured by the immobilized antigens. A
second series of wash steps remove any unbound material. Following the addition of
the substrate, a color is detected spectrophotometrically due to the enzyme-antibody-
antigen complexes that form the presence of ASCA.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The intra-assay reproducibility was determined by testing 18 fecal specimens
in replicates in one run. Thirteen ASCA positive samples with OD of 0.157 to
0.918 had %CV of 3.6-15.2%. Eight of these samples were close to the cut-off
(≤0.150 OD) with OD ranged from 0.157 to 0.501 had a CV of 3.6-15.2%.
Five ASCA negative samples with OD of 0.026 to 0.048 had CV of 6.0-9.6%.
The inter-assay precision was determined by testing 12 fecal specimens three
times over a 6-day period with one kit lot. Eight ASCA positive samples with
OD of 0.193 to 1.341 had %CV of 6.0-27.5%. Three of these samples were
close to the cut-off (≤0.150 OD) had OD ranged from 0.193 to 0.382 had a
CV of 18.8-22.0%. Four ASCA negative samples with OD of 0.033 to 0.081
had %CV of 6.6-18.0%.

Day to day ASCA-CHEK fecal test result variation:
A single subject with Crohn’s disease was screened for fecal ASCA using the
ASCA-CHEK test and then followed for a 4 day period. A single specimen
was obtained each day for the analysis. The fecal ASCA result was positive on
day 1 and remained positive during the 4 day test period. The OD results
450
ranged from 0.893 to 1.371 with a mean ± SD of 0.1.136 ± 0.211 and 95% CI
of 0.801 to 1.471 for the 4- day period.
In a second evaluation, a female subject suffering with Crohn’s disease for the
presence of fecal ASCA over a 122 day period using the ASCA-CHEK test
was followed. A single fecal specimen was collected at sampling points
ranging from day 1 to day 122 and tested by the ASCA-CHEK test. A total of
5 fecal specimens, two of which were close to the OD cut-off of 0.150 (0.211
and 0.350), remained ASCA-CHEK test positive during the 4-month period.
The OD results ranged from 0.211 to 0.722 with a mean ± SD of 0.500 ±
450
0.212 and 95% CI of 0.237 to 0.763 for the 122 day period.

specimens) were spiked with potential interfering substances and were tested
seven times. The interfering substances were listed as follows: mucous, fecal
fat, Mylanta®, Blood, Protein, Pepto-Bismol®, Imodium®, Kaopectate®,
Leukocytes, and Bilirubin. The studies were designed according to the CLSI
EP7-A guidance document. None of the substances listed above interfered
with the ASCA-CHEK test results.
Cross-reactivity: No cross-reactivity was observed the ASCA-CHEK test on
ASCA-negative fecal specimens spiked with media cultures of the following
intestinal organisms: Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus
subtilis, Bacteroides fragilis, Campylobacter coli, Campylobacter jejuni,
Candida albicans, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium difficile (non-
toxigenic) VPI 11186, Clostridium difficile (toxigenic) VPI 10463,

Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
The package insert ‘Cross-reactivity Section’ states that “The ASCA-CHEK
test was not evaluated for potential cross-reactivity with enteric viruses.”
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off at ≤0.150 OD was established by analyzing 24 fecal specimens
(12 from Crohn’s disease and 12 from non-Crohn’s disease). The 24 fecal
specimens were diluted at 1:10 and tested at 2 different OD cut-off values of
0.200 and 0.150. The same 24 fecal specimens were also diluted at 1:20 and
were tested at the same 2 OD cut-off values of 0.200 and 0.150. The OD
results generated from both specimen dilutions and at the 2 different OD cut-
offs at 0.200 and 0.150, were statistically analyzed. The analysis was to
determine the optimal combination (specimen dilution and OD cut-off) that
provided the best correlation to clinically confirmed Crohn’s disease. The
1:10 dilution in combination of the OD cut-off at 0.150 provided the highest
correlation (75%) to Crohn’s disease. The sensitivity and specificity were
58% and 92% respectively.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Comparison was determined against the predicate ASCA EIA kits using 82
samples (45% were from adult patients and 55% from pediatric patients ≤ 18
years old) consisted of: 47 Crohn’s Disease; 23 Ulcerative colitis; 7
IBS/cancer/other; and 5 healthy persons. Results are summarized in the table
