I. Device Description:
The AutoCheck6+ quality control system includes control material at four different
levels (Levels 1-4). The controls are aqueous and consist of a buffer with salts,
metabolites, enzymes, dyes and preservatives, equilibrated with carbon dioxide and
oxygen. The controls do not contain any animal or biological components.
The controls are supplied in 0.7 mL ampoules, 30 ampoules per box of each control
level. The ampoules are used only once after being opened.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
AutoCheck5+
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The different parameters contained within AutoCheck6+ are
traceable to various chemistry standards, with most parameters traceable to a
NIST SRM. A Certificate of Traceability was provided for each level of
control. The added parameter, creatinine, is traceable to NIST SRM 914.
The control ranges are determined by using an established protocol that
includes performing runs on six different analyzers and with several different
operators over a number of days. The final ranges for each level of the control
are lot specific and found on the Control Ranges data sheets provided with the
product. Additionally, the controls can only be used on the Radiometer
analyzers listed on the data sheets.
Stability: The stability of the closed ampoules was established using both
real-time and accelerated stability studies. Only closed container stability was
performed since the control is used only one time after the ampoule is opened.
Since the stability in the labeling is stated to be 24 months at 2-8°C, 4 weeks
at up to 25°C, or 15 days for up to 32°C, several different stability studies are
performed. These included storage at 6°C, 10°C, and 25°C for 103 weeks as
well as storage at 32°C and 40°C for 39 weeks and 26 weeks respectively.
Upon testing at the various time points, the measured results must fall within
the preset acceptable performance limits for each parameter.
