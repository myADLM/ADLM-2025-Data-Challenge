H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The MP RapidBUP Test Strip is an immunochromatography based one step in
vitro test. It is designed for qualitative determination of the major metabolite
of buprenorphine, buprenorphine-3-β-d-glucuronide, in human urine
specimens at cut-off level of 10 ng/ml.
The MP RapidBUP Test Strip may be used in a point-of-care (POC) setting
and will provide preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative
chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result.
Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) has been established as the
preferred confirmatory method by the Substance Abuse Mental Health
Services Administration (SAMHSA). Clinical consideration and professional
judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when
preliminary positive results are indicated.
The MP RapidOXY Test Strip is an immunochromatographic one-step in-vitro
test designed for qualitative determination of oxycodone in human urine
specimens above a cut-off level of 100 ng/ml.
The MP RapidOXY Test Strip may be used in a point-of-care (POC) setting
and will provide preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative
chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result.
Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) has been established as the
preferred confirmatory method by the Substance Abuse Mental Health
Services Administration (SAMHSA). Clinical consideration and professional
judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when
preliminary positive results are indicated.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The device is for in vitro diagnostic prescription use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable. The device is a visually read single-use device.
I. Device Description:
The device is a one-step immunochromatographic test intended for the detection of major
metabolite of buprenorphine, buprenorphine-3-β-d-glucuronide, or oxycodone in human
urine. The test device contains a membrane strip, which is pre-coated with drug-protein
2

--- Page 3 ---
conjugate at the test band region of the membrane strip. A wicking pad containing anti-drug
monoclonal antibody-colloidal gold conjugate is placed at one end of the membrane. The
device contains a control region which has a different antigen/antibody from the test region.
The device is for single-use and visually read.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
ACON® OXY One Step Oxycodone Test Strip
For Sure One Step Buprenorphine Test Strip
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
k033047 k042990
3. Comparison with predicate:
Both subject and predicate devices are qualitative immunochromatographic visually read
single-use tests for measurement of the same analyte(s) in the same matrix. Both subject
and predicate devices are competitive immunoassays.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
The sponsor did not reference any guidance documents or standards.
L. Test Principle:
The MP RapidBUP Test Strip and MP RapidOXY Test Strip are based on the principle of
specific immunochemical reaction between antibodies and antigens to analyze particular
compounds in human urine specimen. The assay relies on the competition for binding
antibody between drug conjugate and free drug that may be present in the urine specimen
being tested. When drug is present in the urine specimen, it competes with drug conjugate
for the limited amount of antibody-dye conjugate.
When the amount of drug is equal or more than the cut-off, it will prevent the binding of drug
conjugate to the antibody. Therefore, a positive urine specimen will not show a colored band
on the test line zone, indicating a positive result, while the presence of a colored band
indicates a negative result.
A control line is present in the test window to work as procedural control. This colored band
should always appear on the control line regardless the presence of drug or metabolite.

--- Page 4 ---
A precision study was conducted to assess the precision at the cut-off level for the
MP RapidBUP Test Strip in a point-of-care setting. The control materials used in the
study were commercially purchased, aqueous-based controls (GC/MS calibrated),
spiked with the targeted drug. The precision study was designed to evaluate the
random error of visual interpretation by multiple observers (2 per site) at 3 different
point of care settings (total=3 sites/6 observers) over a period of two (2) days.
Each site tested 60 samples for the presence of buprenorphine using GCMS calibrated
urine controls at three levels: above cutoff, near cutoff, and below cutoff; results are
listed below. Note that samples at the cut-off level were all reported as “POS” or “+”.
NOTE: Samples at <25% of cut-off will give negative results, samples at cut-off
level may give either positive or negative results, samples at >25% cut-off level will
give positive results.
