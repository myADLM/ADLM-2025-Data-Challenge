The ABL837 FLEX is an analyzer used as an in vitro diagnostic tool for measuring
creatinine in whole blood, plasma, and serum. Users measure samples by injection into the
instrument port. The device measures creatinine concentrations using two immobilized
enzyme electrochemical sensors. One sensor responds to the total creatine and creatinine
concentration in the patient sample, [creatine + creatinine]. The second only responds to the
concentration of creatine, [creatine]. The instrument reports the difference of these two
measurements as the concentration of creatinine, [creatinine].

Quantitation”
L. Test Principle:
The measuring system is comprised of two electrodes. The first electrode contains the
enzymes creatinase and sacrosin oxidase immobilized on the middle membrane of a three
membrane diaphragm. Creatine from whole blood diffuses through the first membrane and
decomposes to sarcosine, a reaction catalyzed by the creatinase trapped in the middle
membrane. Sarcosine undergoes a second decomposition catalyzed by entrapped sarcosin
oxidase to produce glycine, formaldehyde, and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide
diffuses through the 3rd backing membrane into an electrolyte solution where it is oxidized to
O at a Pt electrode. The resulting current is proportional to the [creatine] in the patient
2
sample.
The second electrode responds to both creatine and creatinine concentrations through the
addition of creatininase to the middle enzyme-containing membrane. Creatininase catalyzes
the conversion of creatinine to creatine which undergoes a subsequent creatinase catalyzed
reaction to sarcosine. Sacrosine is converted to glycine by sarcosin oxidase with the
production of H O . The hydrogen peroxide diffuses through the 3rd backing membrane
2 2
where it is oxidized on a Pt electrode. Since the patient sample contains endogenous creatine
which also produces H O through sarcosin oxidase catalyzed decomposition, this electrode
2 2
responds to the total concentration of creatine and creatinine, [creatine + creatinine].
Creatinine concentrations are determined as a difference measurement between these two
electrodes.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The company assessed the precision of their device on fresh whole blood using 5
different and freshly prepared creatinine concentrations. The company measured
each concentration 5 times per day over 9 machines for a total of 45 measurements
per day for each concentration, 624 measurements in total. Because creatinine
samples were prepared each day during the 3 day evaluation period, the company
assessed their precision on a total of 15 different concentration preparations of
creatinine. The following is a graphical representation of the company’s findings:

The company followed CSLI EP5 “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical
Chemistry Devices” in assessing the precision of their device using plasma. The
company measured 3 different concentrations of creatinine in plasma in two separate
runs of 2 measurements (four measurements/day) for 20 days. The company repeated
this study on two different analyzers. Creatinine samples were created via spiking
and kept frozen until measurement to prevent change in [creatinine] via the
creatinine-creatine equilibrium. The following is a summary of the company’s
findings:

The company further assessed the variability in their device by performing repeated
measurements on three levels of quality control material. The company measured
each level of material 3 times a day for 20 days on 10 different analyzers. As
creatinine in the QC material was in equilibrium with creatine, the material was
refrigerated but not frozen. The following is a summary of the company’s findings:

The data supplied by the company supports the precision claims made by the
company in their product labeling.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The company demonstrated the linearity of their proposed device by comparison to
HPLC measurements. Because the proposed device determines [creatinine] – over
the 0.3 – 20.4 mg/dL measurement range - indirectly through a difference
measurement, the company first demonstrated the linearity of their device in the
determination of creatinine against three background concentrations of creatine in
serum. The company used HPLC as the comparator to independently assess the
creatinine concentrations. After demonstrating the impact of varying creatine on
creatinine measurements, the company demonstrated the linearity of proposed device
vs. HPLC on serum and plasma samples. The company demonstrated the linearity of
their proposed device on whole blood by comparison to measurements made on their
device using plasma.
ABL 837 versus HPLC on Serum
Using a dialyzed serum pool, the company prepared test samples at seven different
concentrations of creatinine. Creatinine concentrations for these samples were
assigned as the mean of HPLC measurements. The company performed 3

measurements per day for 3 days across 9 analyzers at each creatinine concentration.
A total of 492 measurements were reported. The company determined that the slope
of their proposed device versus the reference method was 0.9935, the intercept was -
0.007 mg/dL creatinine, and the r-squared value of the fit was 0.9989. Deviations
from linearity were not judged to be statistically significant.
ABL 837 versus HPLC on Plasma
Using a dialyzed plasma pool, the company prepared test samples at seven different
concentrations of creatinine. Creatinine concentrations for these samples were
assigned as the mean of HPLC measurements. The company performed 3
measurements per day for 3 days across 9 analyzers at each creatinine concentration.
A total of 184 measurements were reported. The company determined that the slope
of their proposed device versus the reference method was 0.9772, the intercept was
0.019 mg/dL creatinine, and the r-squared value of the fit was 0.9994. Deviations
from linearity were not judged to be statistically significant.
ABL 837 (whole blood) versus ABL 837 (plasma)
The company used split clinical samples, whole blood and plasma, to demonstrate the
linearity of their proposed device using whole blood. The company compared the
performance of their proposed device on whole blood to that of their proposed device
measuring the matched plasma samples. Measurements of the plasma samples were
treated as the reference values in this comparison. The company performed a total of
596 comparisons on clinical samples ranging in concentration from 0.46 to 23.16
mg/dL creatinine. Measurements were made in duplicate on both matrices. The
company determined that the slope of their proposed device versus the reference
method was 0.9888, the intercept was 0.045 mg/dL creatinine, and the r-squared
value of the fit was 0.9989. Deviations from linearity were not judged to be
statistically significant.
The company noted that their proposed device uses a pre-programmed, algorithmic
transformation to convert the reported whole blood measurements to their plasma
equivalent.
The data provide by the company supports their claim for linearity on whole blood
over the concentration range of 0.28 – 20.36 mg/dL creatinine.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The company validated the claimed shelf life of their calibrators through accelerated
aging studies. Calibrators were stored at different temperatures and withdrawn
periodically for measurement. A total of 50 bottles for each level of calibrator were
stored at varying temperatures. Withdrawn material was assayed using both the
proposed device and a third party analyzer. The sponsor claims a 3 month shelf life
for the calibrator solutions when stored at room temperature.
6

--- Page 7 ---
The company validated their claim for an “on-board” stability of their calibration
using real-time data. The company provided data that demonstrated that their
calibrators and device provided consistent results for the full 14 day period claimed in
their product literature.
The company’s cleaning solution contains creatinine and, as such, could change in
performance due to the creatitine/creatine equilibrium. The company assessed the
stability of their cleaning solutions through accelerated aging studies.
The company claims a 3 month shelf life for their cleaning solution when stored at
room temperature.
d. Detection limit:
The company followed CLSI EP17 “Protocols for Determination of Limits of
Detection and Limits of Quantitation” in assessing the lower measurement limit of
their device. The company determined their limit of the blank, limit of detection, and
limit of quantitation for their proposed device using serum. Serum was dialyzed to 0
mg/dL creatinine and creatine and then adjusted by spiking.
To determine the limit of the blank, the company spiked 0 mg/dLcreatinine serum to
0, 0.57, and 1.41 mg/dL creatine. The company measured these creatine samples 4
times at each concentration on 7 ABL837 analyzers over 2 days. From the mean and
standard deviation of this set of measurements, the company determined that their
limit of the blank was 0.04 mg/dL creatinine
To determine their limit of detection, the company assayed 0.11 mg/dL creatinine
samples containing backgrounds of 0, 0.57, and 1.41 mg/dL creatine. Samples were
measured 4 times over 2 days on 7 different ABL837 analyzers. Samples were kept
at -20 °C and thawed before analysis. From the mean and standard deviation of this
set of measurements, the company determined that their limit of detection was 0.06
mg/dL creatinine
The company determined the lower limit of quantitation, the lowest concentration
where the device yielded clinically acceptable results, from an analysis of their total
error and measurements on 0.11 and 0.28 mg/dL creatinine samples containing
backgrounds of 0, 0.57, and 1.41 mg/dL creatine. As before, samples were measured
4 times over 2 days on 7 different ABL837 analyzers. Samples were kept at -20 °C
and thawed before analysis. Both the 0.11 and 0.28 mg/dL creatinine measurements
showed a consistent 0.02 mg/dL offset. The total error, defined by the company as
the absolute bias plus twice the standard deviation, was 0.05 mg/dL, less than the
limit of detection of 0.06 mg/dL.
The company opted to claim a lower limit for their device of 0.11 mg/dL. Based on
the information supplied by the company, errors at this claimed lower limit will incur
7

--- Page 8 ---
a total error of approximately 40%. The sponsor’s claimed measuring range is 0.3 -
20.4 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The company followed CLSI EP-7A “Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry,
Approved Guideline” in assessing the impact of endogenous and exogenous
chemicals on the performance of their device. Testing was performed on serum
samples derived from one large pool derived from a single healthy donor. Serum
samples were frozen and thawed immediately before use. Prior to measurement, 2
samples were thawed. The test sample was spiked to the target concentration with the
interfering analyte. The control sample was spiked with an equal volume of saline.
Measurements on both the sample with the interferant and the unadulterated control
were conducted in triplicate.
The company set their maximum tolerated interference at an absolute change in
concentration of 0.09 mg/dL. With their criteria, the company did not note any
interference. The following is a summary of the company’s findings:
