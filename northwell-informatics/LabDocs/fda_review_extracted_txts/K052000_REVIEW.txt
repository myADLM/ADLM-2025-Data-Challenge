L. Test Principle:
The ARCHITECT® CA 19-9™ assay is a two-step immunoassay to determine the
XR
presence of 1116-NS-19-9 reactive determinants in human serum or plasma, using
CMIA technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex®. In the
first step of the assay, sample and anti-CA 19-9 coated paramagnetic microparticles
are combined. CA 19-9 reactive determinants present in the sample bind to the anti-
CA 19-9 coated microparticles. After washing, anti-CA 19-9 acridinium-labeled
conjugate is added in the second step. After another wash cycle, pre-trigger and
trigger solutions are then added to the reaction mixture; the resulting
chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). A direct
relationship exists between the quantity of CA 19-9 reactive determinants in the
sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT i optical system.

Study 2 – Four representative human serum pools spiked with various
concentrations of CA 19-9 (50.06, 288.16, 719.38 and 677.26 U/mL) were
tested in replicates of four, two runs per day for 13 nonconsecutive days
on two instruments with two lots of reagents. The total %CV ranged from
3.7% to 6.2%.
ii. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated according to CLIS EP6-P2. Aliquots of 10 human
serum samples were spiked with CA 19-9 to concentrations within the
assay dynamic range. Each sample was automatically diluted by the
ARCHITECT instrument with wash buffer. The undiluted and diluted
samples were assayed in duplicate and the percent recoveries determined.
The expected value was obtained by dividing the undiluted observed value
by a dilution factor. The average percent recovery of each sample ranged
from 98% to 117% with a mean average of 105%. Acceptance criterion
for mean recovery was 100±15%.
Auto-dilution verification was assessed by assaying aliquots of 10 human
serum samples spiked with CA 19-9 to concentrations within the assay
dynamic range and manually diluted 1:10 with the wash buffer. The
undiluted and diluted samples were tested in replicates of two. The
undiluted samples were also tested in replicates of two using the 1:10
auto-dilution protocol of the assay. The percent recoveries of the manual
and auto-diluted samples were calculated and compared. The average
recovery of the auto-dilution protocol to manual dilution was 93%.
Spike recovery – Aliquots of 10 normal human serum specimens with
known endogenous CA 19-9 levels were spiked with various
concentrations of CA 19-9 (124.2, 175.7, 629.9 and 884.7 U/mL) and
assayed in duplicate. The percent recovery was calculated. The percent
recoveries ranged from 94% to 128% and the mean recovery was 105%.
The assay measuring range is from 0 U/mL to 1200 U/mL.
iii. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
There is no known reference standard for CA 19-9. The ARCHITECT®
CA 19-9™ Calibrators were standardized against the Fujirebio
XR
Diagnostics, Inc. CA 19-9 reference preparation. The ARCHITECT® CA
19-9™ primary calibrators are manufactured gravimetrically by diluting
XR
the CA 19-9 antigen stock in Calibrator Standard Matrix and assayed

using the Fujirebio Diagnostics Inc. CA 19-9™ RIA assay. The values
were validated by a panel of patient serum samples on two lots of
ARCHITECT® CA 19-9™ reagent kit and three ARCHITECT
XR
instrument systems. The same panel was also tested on three lots of the
Fujirebio Diagnostics Inc. CA 19-9™ RIA kit.
iv. Detection limit (functional sensitivity):
The minimal detectable dose (MDD) was determined by testing the
ARCHITECT® CA 19-9™ Calibrator A (0 U/mL) in replicates of 10
XR
followed by two replicates of ARCHITECT® CA 19-9™ Calibrator B
XR
(30 U/mL), on three instruments using two lots of calibrators and two lots
of ARCHITECT® CA 19-9™ reagents. The mean values and the
XR
standard deviations (SD) of the 18 sets of Calibrator A and the mean
values of the 18 sets of Calibrator B were used to calculate the MDD for
each run. MDD = [(2 x SD ) x Conc ]/(Mean RLU – Mean
CalA CalB CalB
RLU ). Limit of detection (LOD) is defined as the lowest measurable
CalA
CA 19-9 concentration that can be distinguish from zero and equal to
(MDD + 2SD). The mean LDL claim is ≤ 2.0 U/mL.

v. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous substances - Interference was determined by spiking a known
amount of an interfering substance into serum samples supplemented with
CA 19-9. Interfering substances tested included hemoglobin (600 mg/dL),
bilirubin (22 mg/dL), triglycerides (5100 mg/dL) and total protein (10
g/dL). Five samples were used for bilirubin, hemoglobin and triglycerides
and four samples for total protein. Spiked and non-spiked samples were
tested in duplicate and percent recoveries were calculated. Percent mean
recoveries ranged from 91% for total protein to 102% for hemoglobin at
the levels tested.
Pharmaceutical compounds – Interference was determined by spiking the
following pharmaceutical compounds into serum samples and assayed:
Leucovorin (11.4 mg/dL), Gemzar/Gemcitabine HCl (38.2 mg/dL),
Streptozotocin/Zanosar (28 mg/dL), Doxorubicin (4 mg/dL).
Cyclophosphamide/Cytoxan (37.5 mg/dL), Cisplatin (5.7 mg/dL), 5-
Flourouracil/Adrucil (39 mg/dL), Methotrexate/Amethopterin-Hydrate (91
mg/dL), Tamoxifen (2.28 µg/dL), Cytarabine (3 mg/dL) and
Paclitaxel/Taxol (6.7 mg/dL). Spiked and non-spiked samples were tested
in replicates and percent recoveries were calculated. At the concentrations
tested, the percent mean recoveries ranged from 97% to 104%.
Human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) - To assess interference due to
HAMA, five HAMA positive samples and one normal sample were
studied. Each sample was split into three aliquots. One aliquot was

spiked with CA 19-9 antigen to achieve 35 U/mL while the second aliquot
was spiked with the same volume of antigen to achieve 250 U/mL. The
third aliquot was spiked with an equivalent volume of antigen free matrix
and served as the control. All aliquots were run in duplicate in the same
run. Percent recoveries were calculated and for the HAMA samples with
35 U/mL CA 19-9, the % recovery ranged from 84% to 95% (mean =
91%) and for samples with 250 U/mL CA 19-9, the % recovery ranged
from 74% to 104% (mean = 94%).
Rheumatoid factor (RF) - To assess interference due to RF, five RF
positive samples and one normal sample were tested. Each sample was
split into three aliquots. One aliquot was spiked with CA 19-9 antigen to
achieve 35 U/mL while the second aliquot was spiked with the same
volume of antigen to achieve 250 U/mL. The third aliquot was spiked
with an equivalent volume of antigen free matrix and served the control.
All aliquots were run in duplicate in the same run. Percent recoveries
were calculated and recoveries for samples with 35 U/mL CA 19-9 ranged
from 82% to 95% (mean = 88%) and for samples with 250 U/mL CA 19-
9, % recovery ranged from 74% to 104% (mean = 99%).

2. Comparison studies:
i. Method comparison with predicate device:
Two hundred fifty nine serum samples were tested on the ARCHITECT®
CA 19-9™ assay and the Fujirebio CA 19-9™ RIA Assay. All samples
XR
with values outside the dynamic range of either assay were diluted per
package inserts. Excluded from analysis were 41 samples with values
below the limit of detection (< 2.0 U/mL) and 23 samples with values
above the dynamic range even after auto dilution (> 12,000 U/mL) of the
ARCHITECT® CA 19-9™ assay. In addition, one sample with
XR
discrepant results on both assays and one with an invalid CV in the
Fujirebio assay were excluded. The remaining 193 samples were analyzed
by Passing-Bablok linear regression analysis. The CA 19-9 concentrations
of the specimen as determined by the Fujirebio CA 19-9™ RIA ranged
from 1.17 to 10,782 U/mL. The Passing-Bablok linear regression analysis
yielded a slope of 1.2 (99% CI 1.08, 1.37) and y-axis intercept of -5.1
U/mL (99% CI -7.4, -3.4) with a Spearman Correlation coefficient of 0.96.
In addition to regression analysis, samples were also evaluated to the
percent agreement with the predicate device (see table below):

Serial Monitoring Analysis
Two hundred and sixty one serum samples from 74 patients with
confirmed pancreatic cancer collected and banked at two US clinical sites
were analyzed. The average number of sample pairs per patient was 3.5
(see table below)

3 2 36 48.6
4 3 37 50.0
5 4 1 1.4
The average age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 61.8 years
ranging from 41 to 85 years. Fifty-five percent were males and forty-five
percent females. Majority of the patients (80%) were Caucasians, the
remaining 20% consisted of African-Americans (11%), Hispanics (8%)
and Asians (1%). Only 9% of the patients were current smokers, 51%
were past smokers and 38% nonsmokers (smoking status of one patient
was unknown). At the time of diagnosis, 30% of the patients had diabetes
and 27% had other medical conditions. Of the diabetic patient subset,
64% were males.

Sixty-nine of the 74 patients had disease stage information: 4.34% were
Stage I, 7.25% Stage II, 44.9% Stage III, and 43.5% stage IV. Ninety-five
percent of the pancreatic tumors were adenocarcinomas with 65%
involving the head of the pancreas. In addition, histology stratification
showed that 13.51% were as well differentiated, 22.97% moderately
differentiated, 5.41% poor to moderately differentiated, 12.16% poorly
differentiated and 45.95% as other.
Changes in CA 19-9 concentrations and changes in disease state were
analyzed on a per-visit basis. A significant change in CA 19-9 was
defined as greater than 14% (2.5 times the total precision %CV). The
following tables show the association between CA 19-9 concentrations
and disease status for the 187 evaluable observation pairs. The 95%
confidence intervals for the concordance statistics were based on General
Estimable Equations and calculated using the GENMOD procedure of
SAS.

Serial monitoring results were also analyzed on a per-patient basis as
shown below. Concordances and 95% CI were determined. Confidence
intervals for these estimates were determined using binomial distribution.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The normal reference range was established by testing serum samples from
360 apparently healthy subjects consisted of 180 females and 180 males. Of
the 180 female subjects, 56 were post-menopausal and 124 premenopausal.
No age or ethnicity information was provided. No analysis was performed
according to age, gender or ethnicity. A cumulative distribution was
established and the 99th percentile was determined to be 64.39 U/mL and the
95th percentile was 37.83 U/mL. The table below shows the distribution of
CA 19-9 results.
