c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
A master calibrator is developed that has values assigned that are traceable to
the method “gold standard”. Iron Standard is a gravimetrically prepared
product with a target value of 500 μg/dL. This product is assayed and
compared to a NIST standard prepared from SRM 937, Iron Metal (Clinical).
Values are confirmed on Hitachi analyzers using the Iron or UIBC reagent kit.
The reagent is calibrated using the 500 μg/dL NIST standard. Replicates of the Deleted: 25 r
new batch of Iron Standard are run, followed by replicates of the NIST Deleted: 5
standard and replicates of a previously released lot of Iron Standard. The new
Deleted: 10
product, the NIST Standard, and the previously released lot of Iron Standard
met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria.
Two studies were performed in order to verify the stability claims for Deleted:

Study 1: Real Time Stability. The Iron product is stored at 15-25Cº for 6
months, 9 months and 12 months. The Iron reagent is calibrated using the 500
μg/dL NIST standard. Using a Hitachi 917, testing is performed at 6, 9 and 12
months on replicates of the new batch of Iron Standard, followed by replicates Deleted: 25
of the NIST standard and replicates of a previously released lot of Iron
Deleted: 5
Standard. The new product, the NIST Standard, and the previously released
Deleted: 10
lot of Iron Standard met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria.
Study 2: Accelerated Stability: At the 11th month of a 12 month shelf life, the
Iron product is incubated for 5 days at 45º C and equilibrated to the labeled
storage temperature, 15-25Cº. The Iron reagent is calibrated using 500 μg/dL
NIST standard. Using a Hitachi 917, replicates of the new batch of Iron Deleted: 25
Standard are run, followed by replicates of the NIST standard and replicates
Deleted: 5
of a previously released lot of Iron Standard. The new product, the NIST
Deleted: 10
Standard, and the previously released lot of Iron Standard met the sponsor’s
acceptance criteria.
The results of the real time and accelerated stability studies support the claim Deleted:
of a 12 month expiration date.
