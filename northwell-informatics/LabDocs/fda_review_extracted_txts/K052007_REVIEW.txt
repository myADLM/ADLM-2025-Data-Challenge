6. Quality Control:
The Quality Control allows the user to check the quality of measurements
performed by the instrument. Statistical analyses of the control results are
performed. These statistical analyses consist in calculating the average, the
standard deviation and the coefficient of variation of the measurement over a
defined period. They can be carried out over the following periods:
- the current Worklist
- a specific month
- a specific year.
The Quality Control is done by reviewing either the results and statistical analyses
of a selected control for each test controlled with this control or the results and
statistical analyses of all controls used for a selected test.
