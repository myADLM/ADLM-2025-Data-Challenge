H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Hemoglobin A1c Linearity is intended for use as quality control material to
demonstrate linearity throughout the reportable range of Hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c%) for immunoassay and HPLC test methods using protocols established
by individual laboratories.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Prescription Use Only
For In vitro diagnostic use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Immunoassay and HPLC analyzers
I. Device Description:
Cone Bioproducts’ Hemoglobin A1c Linearity Set is provided in liquid form and is
prepared from human blood to which stabilizers are added. The product consists of
four levels that are manufactured to include target ranges that are of clinical
significance and test the dynamic range of Hemoglobin A1c Immunoassay and HPLC
determination methods.
Levels 1 and 4 are prepared so that Level 1 meets the lower limit of the instrument
manufacturer’s claimed linearity and Level 4 the upper limit. Admixtures of levels 1
and 4 are made to create levels 2 and 3. All levels of the product are run in triplicate
on the Immunoassay or HPLC test method for which the product is designed.
Each donor unit used in the manufacturing of this product was tested by FDA
approved methods and found to be non-reactive for Human Immunodeficient Virus
(HIV-1, HIV-2) antibody, Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HbsAg) and Hepatitis C
Virus (HCV) antibody.

L. Test Principle:
Not applicable
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This product is certified by National Glycohemoglobin Standardization
Program for traceability to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial
Reference method. The assigned values are traceable to a commercially
available HbA1c Calibrator Set.
Each level is assayed in triplicate on the Immunoassay or HPLC test method
for which the product is designed. The sponsor defines acceptance criterion
as values being within 10% of the target concentration.
Accelerated stability studies are conducted to determine closed vial stability
for the product. Vials are stored at -20°C and 25ºC and one sample of each
level is tested by HPLC at 0, 6, 24, and 30 hours. The sponsor defines
acceptance criterion as results falling within ± 20% from the initial value. The
sponsor has determined that the Hemoglobin A1c Linearity Set is stable for 2
years when stored at -20ºC.
Real time stability studies are conducted to determine the open vial stability
for the product. Vials are stored at 2-8ºC and tested by HPLC at 0, 7, 14, 21,
27 and 35 days. The sponsor defines acceptance criterion as results falling
within ± 20% of the initial value. The sponsor has determined that the
Hemoglobin A1c Linearity Set is stable for 14 days when stored at 2-8ºC in
tightly closed containers.
