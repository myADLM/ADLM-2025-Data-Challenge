L. Test Principle:
The automated Dimension® CSAE method uses an immunoassay technique in which
free and CSA-bound antibody-enzyme species are separated using magnetic particles.
The assay is performed using a method-specific Flex® reagent cartridge. The Flex®
cartridge contains a pretreatment reagent, ß-galactosidase-CSA antibody conjugate,
CSA immobilized on chromium dioxide particles, chlorophenol red ß-d-
galactopyranoside(CPRG) substrate, and diluent to hydrate the tablets.
To perform the CSAE assay, a sample cup containing the whole blood sample to be
analyzed and a CSAE Flex® reagent cartridge are placed on the Dimension® system.
The Dimension® system mixes and lyses the whole blood sample. The lysed sample
is then mixed with the antibody conjugate reagent to bind CSA present in the sample.
Magnetic particles coated with CSA are added to bind free (unbound) antibody-
enzyme conjugate. The reaction mixture is then separated magnetically. Following
separation, the supernatant containing the CSA-antibody-enzyme complex is
transferred to another cuvette and mixed with the substrate. ß-galactosidase catalyzes
the hydrolysis of CPRG (chlorophenol red ß-d- galactopyranoside ) to produce CPR
(chlorophenol red) which absorbs light maximally at 577nm. The change in
absorbance at 577nm due to the formation of CPR is directly proportional to the
amount of CSA in the patient sample and is measured using a bichromatic
(577,700nm) rate technique.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Imprecision studies were based on CLSI Guideline EP5-A. CSA spiked whole
pooled blood and commercial control materials were used in a total of two
assays per day, two replicates per assay, over 20 days, calibrated twice.
Imprecision results were within the acceptance criteria set by the sponsor.
Results are summarized in the table below:

QC Level 3 1301.9 34.4 2.6 68.9 5.3
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Standard solutions were prepared by sequential mixing to create equally
spaced sample pools starting with a high and low pool of known analyte
concentration. Theoretical concentrations were computed for all intermediate
pools based on the initial concentrations of the high and low pools.
The linearity of cyclosporine A on the Dimension® RxL by the Dimension®
CSAE assay was evaluated by comparing observed versus expected values
across the assay range. A linear regression analysis was performed on the data
and plotted. The observed linearity across the reportable range has a
correlation coefficient of 0.998, slope of 1.01, an intercept of -23.26, and a
deviation from the estimated line of 0.054 ng/mL [0.045 nmol/L] with 95%
confidence. The assay range claim is 350.0 ng/mL [291.7 nmol/L] to 2000
ng/mL [1664.0 nmol/L].
To test recovery, known amounts of CSA were added to human whole blood
samples with concentrations of 610.0, 1232.2, and 1861.8 ng/mL [507.5,
1025.2, 1861.8 nmol/L]. Final CSA concentrations were measured. The
calculated percent recovery ranged from 94.3% to 105.6% with a mean
recovery of 101.0%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The shelf life of the Dimension CSAE flex reagent cartridge is 12 months
based on real time stability testing of three lots of product.
Calibrators for this assay were evaluated in k052015. The assay method is
traceable to an internal protocol described in that submission.
d. Detection limit:
The functional sensitivity of the assay was demonstrated to be below the
lower end of the assay range (<350 ng/mL). Patient samples greater than 2000
ng/mL CSA will generate an “Above Assay Range” test result. The
manufacturer recommends manual 1:1 dilution of the sample with CSAE
Calibrator Level 0 (diluent) and re-assaying the diluted sample. Laboratory
experiments showed that the method had a consistent linear dilution profile

and acceptable recovery of diluted samples.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity of CSAE with the six major metabolites of CSA (M1, M8,
M17, M21, AM1c, and AM1c9) was established by spiking the metabolites
into whole blood containing 500 ng/mL CSA. Cross-reactivity was between
2.1% and 4.7%, within the manufacture’s specifications.
Dimension® CSAE was evaluated for interference according to CLSI EP7-A
where bias is defined as the difference between the control sample (without
the interferent) and the test sample that contains the interferent expressed as a
percentage. Bias exceeding 10% was considered interference. Whole pooled
blood spiked with 800 ng/mL CSA was used to demonstrate that the

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Two clinical studies were run at two large university hospitals. Patients
(n=140 total) enrolled were heart, liver, or kidney transplant patients receiving
cyclosporine therapy with CSA concentration ranges between 350ng/mL and
2000ng/mL. Studies were performed using routine methods for quality
control, maintenance and calibration as described in the instrument
instructions for use. Samples were tested with the Dimension® CSAE assay
on a Dimension® clinical chemistry systems located at both external sites. All
samples were also tested at one site with the predicate assay and at the other
site by LC/MS technology.
Results presented in the graphs and table below include all organ types and
both clinical sites. There was some variability between organ types.
Regression analysis was comparable between the two clinical sites.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor provides the following statement in the labeling regarding Expected
Values:
There is no universally established therapeutic range for cyclosporine in whole
blood. Values obtained with different assay methods cannot be used
interchangeably due to differences in assay methods and reagent specificity.
Individual cyclosporine values cannot be used as the sole indicator for making
changes in the treatment regimen. Each patient should be thoroughly evaluated
clinically before treatment adjustments are made and each user must establish his
or her own ranges based on these clinical experiences. Because of varying
patterns of cross-reactivity with metabolites, the consistent use of one assay for
individual patients is recommended. Conversion factors obtained from assay
method comparisons should not be used to predict values for individual patients.
The complexity of the clinical state, individual differences in sensitivity to
immunosuppressive and nephrotoxic effects of cyclosporine, co-administration of
other immunosuppressants, type of transplant, time post-transplant, and a number
of other factors contribute to different requirements for optimal blood levels of
cyclosporine.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
