The Osmetech OPTI LION Electrolyte Analyzer is intended to be used for the
measurement of sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium and pH in samples of
whole blood, serum and plasma as appropriate in either a traditional clinical laboratory
setting or point-of-care locations by personnel minimally qualified to perform and report
these results. For Professional Use Only. For In Vitro Diagnostic Use.
Sodium
Sodium is the major cation of extracellular fluid. Its primary functions in the
body are to chemically maintain osmotic pressure and acid-base balance and to
transmit nerve impulses. Sodium functions at the cell membrane level by creating
an electrical potential between different cell membranes causing the transmission
of nerve impulses and neuromuscular excitability to be maintained. Sodium is
involved in some enzyme catalyzed reactions as a cofactor. The body has a
strong tendency to maintain a total base content, and only slight changes are
found even under pathologic conditions.
Low sodium values, hyponatremia, usually reflect a relative excess of body water rather
than a low total body sodium. Reduced sodium levels may be associated with: low
sodium intake; sodium losses due to vomiting or diarrhea with adequate water and
inadequate salt replacement, diuretics abuse, or salt-losing nephropathy; osmotic diuresis,
metabolic acidosis; adrenocortical insufficiency; congenital adrenal hyperplasia; dilution
type due to edema, cardiac failure, hepatic failure; and hypothyroidism.
Elevated sodium values, hypernatremia, are associated with conditions with water loss in
excess of salt loss through profuse sweating, prolonged hyperpnea, severe vomiting or
diarrhea, diabetes insipidus or diabetic acidosis; increased renal sodium conservation in
hyperaldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome; inadequate water intake because of coma or
2

--- Page 3 ---
hypothalamic diseases; dehydration; or excessive saline therapy.
The sodium value obtained may be used in the diagnosis or monitoring of all disturbances
of the water balance, infusion therapies, vomiting, diarrhea, burns, heart and kidney
insufficiencies, central or renal diabetes insipidus, endocrine disturbances and primary or
secondary cortex insufficiency of the adrenal gland or other diseases involving electrolyte
imbalance.
Potassium
Potassium is the major cation in the intracellular fluid and functions as the primary buffer
within the cell itself. Ninety percent of potassium is concentrated within the cell, and
damaged cells release potassium into the blood. Potassium plays an important role in
nerve conduction, muscle function, and helps maintain acid-base balance and osmotic
pressure.
Elevated potassium levels, hyperkalemia, can be found in oligouria, anemia, urinary
obstruction, renal failure due to nephritis or shock, metabolic or respiratory acidosis,
renal tubular acidosis with the K+/H+ exchange and hemolysis of the blood. Low
potassium levels, hypokalemia, can be found in excessive loss of potassium through
diarrhea or vomiting, inadequate intake of potassium, malabsorption, severe burns and
increased secretion of aldosterone. High or low potassium levels may cause changes in
muscle irritability, respiration and myocardial function.
The potassium value obtained may be used to monitor electrolyte imbalance in the
diagnosis and treatment of infusion therapies, shock, heart or circulatory insufficiency,
acid-base imbalance, therapy with diuretics, all kinds of kidney problems, diarrhea and
hyper- and hypo-function of adrenal cortex and other diseases involving electrolyte
imbalance.
Chloride
Chloride is an anion that exists predominantly in extracellular spaces. It maintains
cellular integrity through its influence on osmotic pressure. It is also significant in
monitoring acid-base balance and water balance. In metabolic acidosis, there is a
reciprocal rise in chloride concentration when the bicarbonate concentration drops.
Decreased levels are found in severe vomiting, severe diarrhea, ulcerative colitis, pyloric
obstruction, severe burns, heat exhaustion, diabetic acidosis, Addison’s disease, fever and
acute infections such as pneumonia.
Increased levels are found in dehydration, Cushing’s syndrome, hyperventilation,
eclampsia, anemia and cardiac decompensation.
Ionized Calcium
Calcium in blood is distributed as free calcium ions (50%) bound to protein, mostly
albumin (40%) and 10% bound to anions such as bicarbonate, citrate, phosphate and
lactate. However, only ionized calcium can be used by the body in such vital processes as
muscular contraction, cardiac function, transmission of nerve impulses and blood
clotting. The OPTI LION measures the ionized portion of the total calcium. In certain
disorders such as pancreatitis and hyperparathyroidism, ionized calcium is a better
indicator for diagnosis than total calcium.
3

--- Page 4 ---
Elevated calcium, hypercalcemia, is found in patients with increased intestinal
absorption, increased mobilization from bone (osteolysis), decreased renal elimination,
hyperparathyroidism and Addison’s disease. Hypercalcemia may also be present in
various types of malignancy, and calcium measurements may serve as biochemical
markers. In general, while ionized calcium may be slightly more sensitive, either ionized
or total calcium measurements have about equal utility in the detection of occult
malignancy. Hypercalcemia occurs commonly in critically ill patients with abnormalities
in acid-base regulation and losses of protein and albumin, which gives a clear advantage
to monitoring calcium status by ionized calcium measurements.
Decreased calcium, hypocalcemia, is found in patients with decreased intestinal
absorption, increased renal elimination, increased deposition of Calcium in the bones,
increased binding to proteins when the pH increases or binding to citrate, and
hypoparathyroidism.
Patients with renal disease caused by glomular failure often have altered concentrations
of calcium, phosphate, albumin, magnesium and pH. Since these conditions tend to
change ionized calcium independently of total calcium, ionized calcium is the preferred
method of accurately monitoring calcium status in renal disease.
Ionized calcium is important for diagnosis or monitoring of: hypertension management,
parathyroidism, renal diseases, malnutrition, kidney stones, multiple myeloma and
diabetes mellitus.
Ionized calcium may be reported either as the actual ionized calcium, referred to actual
pH of the patients, or as normalized ionized calcium, to a standard pH at pH 7.40. The
binding of calcium by protein and small anions is influenced by pH and because of this
relationship specimens should be analyzed at the pH of the patient’s blood.
For more detailed information about the preanalytical variables affecting ionized calcium,
please refer to the most current edition of CLSI document C31- Ionized Calcium
Determinations: Precollection Variables, Specimen Choice, Collection, and Handling.
pH
The pH value is an indicator of the balance between the buffer (blood), renal (kidney) and
respiratory (lung) systems, and one of the most tightly controlled parameters in the body.
The causes of abnormal blood pH values are generally classified as:
• primary bicarbonate deficit metabolic acidosis
• primary bicarbonate excess metabolic alkalosis
• primary hypoventilation respiratory acidosis
• primary hyperventilation respiratory alkalosis
An increase in blood, serum or plasma pH, alkalemia, may be due to increased plasma
bicarbonate, or a feature of respiratory alkalosis due to an increased elimination of CO
2
due to hyperventilation.
A decrease of pH value, academia, in blood, serum or plasma may occur due to an
increased formation of organic acids, an increased excretion of H+-ions in certain renal
disorders, an increased acid intake such as in salicylate poisoning or loss of alkaline body
fluids. Respiratory acidosis is the result of a decreased alveolar ventilation and may be
acute, as the result of pulmonary edema, airway obstruction or medication, or maybe be
chronic, as the result of obstructive or restrictive respiratory diseases.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies were carried out based upon the CLSI guideline EP6-A. Linearity
(aqueous)
The linearity of the OPTI LION analyzer for Na+, K+, and Ca2+ was tested using a
dilution sequence of HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid)
buffers. Nine different concentrations were tested with three replicate measurements
at each level being carried out on two LION instruments (SN 6104 and 6105) and the
9181 predicate.
The linearity of the OPTI LION analyzer for Cl-, was tested using a dilution sequence
of phosphate based buffers containing NaCl. A different buffer was required for
evaluating chloride linearity because the HEPES species interferes with the OPTI
chloride fluorescent sensor. Nine different concentrations were tested with three
replicate measurements at each level being carried out on two LION instruments and
the 9181 predicate.
The linearity of the OPTI LION analyzer for pH was tested using a dilution sequence
of HEPES based designed to cover the pH range 6.5 to 8.0. Nine different
concentrations were tested with three replicate measurements at each level being
carried out on two LION instruments and the 9181 predicate.
To analyze the data, linear, quadratic and cubic regressions were carried out for each
data set.

Linearity (plasma)
To evaluate linearity from of the OPTI LION Analyzer when running plasma
samples, plasma was pooled from a single donor and either spiked, diluted or
tonometered to generate 7 different levels of each analyte. The linearity study was
carried out following the CLSI guideline EP6-A.
The linearity of the OPTI LION analyzer for Na+, K+, and Ca2+ was tested using
pooled plasma which was either spiked with a salt mixture or diluted with deionized
water. Seven different concentrations were tested with three different replicate
measurements at each level being carried out on two LION analyzers (SN 6104 and
SN 6105) and the predicate.

Linearity (whole blood)
To evaluate linearity from of the OPTI LION Analyzer when using whole blood
samples, tubes of heparinized blood was collected and pooled from a single donor and
either spiked, diluted or tonometered to generate 7 different levels of each analyte.
The linearity study was carried out following the CLSI guideline EP6-A.
The linearity of the OPTI LION analyzer for Na+, K+, and Ca2+ was tested using
blood samples which were either spiked with a salt mixture for elevated samples or
diluted with plasma mixed with a buffer and then added to the original samples
packed red cells. Seven different concentrations were tested with three different
replicate measurements at each level being carried out on two LION analyzers (SN
6104 and SN 6105) and the predicate.

The response of the OPTI LION analyzer was evaluated against NIST human serum
reference materials 956b and 909b and was found to recover the values of the NIST
standards for Na and Ca and is indirectly traceable to the reference materials for K
and Cl.
The OPTI LION cassette is designed for storage at 15 – 35oC for 6 months. To assure
OPTI LION stability, a validation of the OPTI LION disposable was tested in final
configuration. Specifically, OPTI LION cassettes are stored over the labeled
temperature range for the duration of the shelf life period. Periodically, measurements
were performed to demonstrate that the system is capable of maintaining accuracy
throughout the shelf life period. Stability testing was performed on a representative
prototype system. The data supports six months shelf life stability.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit for the OPTI LION was determined based on the linearity ranges
established with gravimetrically prepared aqueous standard solutions:
Linearity Range
pH 6.8 – 8.0
Na+ 100mM –
194mM
K+ 1.0mM – 9.6mM
Cl- 63mM – 147mM
Ca2+ 0.3mM – 2.0mM
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were conducted following the experimental protocol
recommended in CLSI EP7-A. Plasma was spiked with known interferents and
compared against control samples. The following effects are caused by the
interferents at the levels listed below.
