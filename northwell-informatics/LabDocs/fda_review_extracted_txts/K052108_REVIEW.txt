I. Device Description:
This device combines the functions of a blood glucose meter and a blood pressure
measurement system in one unit. Supplied with the meter are the test strips, lancets, lancing
device, control solutions and storage case. To measure blood glucose, the user inserts a test
strip. A numerical code appears on the screen and the user compares this number to the
number located on the test strip bottle to ensure the two numbers match. Once the user
confirms that the code number in the meter matches the strip bottle, glucose testing can
proceed. The sponsor has provided instructions and illustrations explaining that the blood
drop will be pulled into the strip sample entry by capillary action and that the confirmation
window must be completely filled with blood to obtain an accurate result. Results are stored
in the meters memory for tracking purposes. The blood pressure monitor system was
previously cleared (k042138). The controls can be purchased separately.
To measure blood pressure, the user is instructed to wrap the cuff around the left wrist with
the palm facing up approximately ¼ to ½ inch below the ball of the thumb. The user is
instructed not to move or talk during the measurement. The sponsor has also provided
instructions and illustrations explaining that the user must be sitting and the blood pressure
cuff must be at the same level as the user’s heart to obtain an accurate reading. Results are
stored in the meters memory for tracking purposes.

Devices, May 2005
FDA Guidance for Industry In Vitro Diagnostic Glucose test System. July 1998
L. Test Principle:
Glucose: the glucose oxidase in the strip reacts with the glucose in the sample to produce an
electrical current proportional to the glucose concentration. The meter measures the current
and converts it to the corresponding glucose concentration in mg/dL or mmol/L.
Blood pressure: the pressure sensor in the cuff detects small changes in pressure and converts
them to electrical signals. The meter analyzes the singles and converts them to standard
measurements of pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated the intra precision of the device by running 5 whole blood
specimens of different concentration (30-400 mg/dL) within one run using 10 meters.
The acceptance criterion is SD < 7.7 mg/dL for glucose values <100 mg/dL and CV
<7.5% for glucose values > 100 mg/dL. The results are presented in the table below:
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Level 5

SD 2.3 2.4 6.3 7.9 19.4
%CV 5.2 2.8 4.7 3.8 5.5
Accuracy was based on the ISO International Standard 15197. Acceptable accuracy
for results shall be: 95% of the individual results shall fall within +15 mg/dL at
glucose concentration <75 and within 20% at glucose concentration >75 mg/dL.
Three hundred and four (304) capillary blood samples were collected and run on the
BGP -100 glucose meter and then run on the reference method (YSI 2300). The
sample range was from 26 to 530 mg/dL. Results are shown in the tables below:
Accuracy results for glucose concentration <75 mg/dL (4.2 mmol/L)
Within + 5 mg/dL Within + 10 mg/dL Within + 15 mg/dL
(Within + 0.28 mmol/L) (Within + 0.56 mmol/L) (Within + 0.83 mmol/L)

A linear regression was also performed and has the following results, y= 1.047x +
4.4358, r =0.994, n=250.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the glucose measurements was demonstrated by comparing prepared
blood samples on the Sein Blood Glucose meter and a glucose reference method
(YSI). The nine samples ranged in concentration from a low of approximately 19
mg/dL to a high of approximately 700 mg/dL. The test results of all values, except for
the 700 mg/dL, satisfy the ISO International Standard 15197. Acceptable accuracy for
results shall be: 95% of the individual results shall fall within +15 mg/dL at glucose
concentration <75 and within 20% at glucose concentration >75 mg/dL. The linear
regression equation obtained with samples ranging from 18 to 108 mg/dL was Y =
0.9894X – 13.3, R2 = 0.9989 and the linear regression equation obtained with samples
ranging from 19 to 600 mg/dL was Y = 1.0X – 21.35, R2 = 0.999.

The reportable range for glucose measurements is 20-600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Two levels of control material are provided for use with the test system and are
traceable to NIST and NBS standards. Values are assigned to the controls by
comparing to a glucose reference method. Stability is assessed by performing real-
time studies for the shelf life and in use stability. Stability is evaluated with the
criterion that all values fall with the established range during the time period tested.
Shelf life is 18 months and in use stability is 90 days when stored between 8 – 30 ºC.
d. Detection limit:
20 mg/dL – See linearity study above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Specificity of the glucose meter was assessed by spiking various endogenous and
exogenous compounds into prepared whole blood samples. The sponsor first prepared
a low whole blood control at approximately 80 mg/dL and a high whole blood control
at approximately 200 mg/dL glucose and confirmed these concentrations prior to the
addition of the interferents. The sponsor then added the interfering substance and ran
each control solution on the BGP-100 system. If the change in glucose measurement
from the control solution was less the 15% this was considered no interference.
Results of the testing were as follows:
Interferent Highest Concentration Where
No Interference Seen (mg/dL)
Acetaminophen 20
Ascorbic Acid 30
Bilirubin 20
Dopamine 15
L-dopa 5
Methyldopa 3
Tolbutamide 150
Triglycerides 3000
Uric Acid 80
The meter was tested at different altitudes to assess the effect of low oxygen levels on
the meter performance. No effect on performance was found when three different
levels of blood were tested up to 10,000 ft., higher elevations were not tested. The
sponsor presented data that supported using the test system between 10ºC to 40ºC.

Hematocrit Effect:
The effect of sample hematocrit variation on the BGP-100 test system was tested
experimentally by preparing samples of known hematocrit and spiking aliquots of
these samples with four different levels of glucose. These samples were run on the
BGP-100 and YSI; there was less than a +15% bias across the claimed range of
20~60% Hematocrit.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
See clinical studies section below.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. The glucose meter is intended to be used with capillary whole blood
from the finger only.
3. Clinical studies:
Two separate clinical studies of the BGP-100 System performance were performed.
The results of these studies are presented in the Clinical Sensitivity section below.
The consumer study was performed at two POC sites with a total of 110 lay-users.
The lay-users ranged in age, education and were about equally divided between males
and females. Each participant performed their own fingerstick and tested their blood
using the instructions in the User’s guide. A trained professional then performed
another fingerstick and tested the blood on the same meter. Blood was collected and
measured on an YSI analyzer.
Another study was performed by Health care professionals at three POC sites. Fifty
patient volunteers participated at each site. A fingerstick was performed for testing on
the BGP-100 and blood was collected for testing on the YSI analyzer.

O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be placed replaced with a new strip for additional
readings. There are no disposable components used to measure blood pressure.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger only. Since
the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no special handling or
storage issues.
5. Calibration:
Each bottle of test strips as a code number which is used to calibrate the meter. The user
confirms that the code number on the test strip bottle matches the code number in the
instrument. If they are different then the user changes the number by depressing the code
key on the meter until the correct number is displayed. No further calibrations are
required of the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor is providing a high and low glucose control solution with this device. To
mark the test result as a control the user is instructed to press and hold the C button for
three seconds. Check will appear on the display. This prevents control results from being
stored in the internal memory. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the
test strip vial label. If control results fall outside these ranges, the user is referred to a list
of troubleshooting steps and the customer care line.
