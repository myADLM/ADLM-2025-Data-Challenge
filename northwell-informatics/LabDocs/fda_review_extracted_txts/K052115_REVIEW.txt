H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Refer to the Indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The First Check® Multi Drug Cup 12 for Marijuana (THC), Cocaine (COC),
Amphetamine (AMP), Methamphetamine (MET), Ecstasy (MDMA), Opiates
(OPI), Phencyclidine (PCP), Benzodiazepine (BZO), Barbiturates (BAR),
Methadone (MTD), Tri-cyclic Antidepressants (TCA) and Oxycodone (OXY)
is a screening test for the rapid detection of the twelve drugs listed above in
human urine. The designated cut-off concentrations of these drugs are as
follows: Marijuana at 50 ng/mL, Cocaine at 300 ng/mL, Amphetamine at
1000 ng/mL, Methamphetamine at 1000 ng/mL, Ecstasy at 500 ng/mL,
Opiates at 2000 ng/mL, Phencyclidine at 25 ng/mL, Benzodiazepine at 300
ng/mL, Barbiturates at 300 ng/mL, Methadone at 300 ng/mL, Tri-cyclic
Antidepressants at 1,000 ng/mL and Oxycodone at 100 ng/mL.
The BAR, BZO, TCA, OXY assay will yield preliminary positive results
when BAR, BZO, TCA and OXY is ingested at or above therapeutic doses.
There are no uniformly recognized drug levels for barbiturate,
benzodiazepine, tricyclic antidepressant and oxycodone in urine. The Multi
Drug Cup 12 shows the drug was or was not present at the cutoff level.
This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific
alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the
preferred confirmatory method for most drugs (HPLC is the preferred
confirmatory method for Tri-cyclic Antidepressants). Clinical consideration
and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result,
particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.
This device is not intended for workplace testing.
The test is intended for over-the-counter (OTC) consumer use as the first step
in a two step process to provide consumers, including but not limited to
concerned parents, with information concerning the presence or absence of the
above stated drugs or their metabolites in a urine sample. Information
regarding confirmatory testing – the second step in the process, along with the
materials for shipping the urine specimen to the laboratory, is provided.
3. Special condition for use statement(s):
The BAR, BZO, TCA, OXY assay will yield preliminary positive results

I. Device Description:
The device is a two piece plastic cup consisting of a plastic specimen collection cup
and a plastic lid with between one and twelve test strips sealed in plastic housing
which is attached to the underside of the lid. To perform the test, you collect a urine
sample with the collection cup provided. Secure the test list lid onto the specimen
collection cup and rest the cup on its side to activate testing. The product also
includes an instruction booklet, a numbered sticker for confidential confirmation
testing, a transportation pouch and a pre-addressed mailing box.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
The sponsor did not reference any standards or guidance documents in their pre-
market submission.
L. Test Principle:
This device uses a one step, rapid chromatographic immunoassay which operates
under the principle of competitive binding. The device contains a nitrocellulose
membrane strip pre-coated with drug-protein conjugate (or antibody) band in the test
region and a pad containing colored antibody (or the drug-protein) colloidal gold
conjugate. A drug-positive urine specimen will not generate a colored line in the test
line region because of drug competition, while a drug-negative urine specimen will
generate a line in the test region because of the absence of drug competition. To serve
as a procedural control, a colored line will always appear at the control line region if
the test has been performed properly. If a control line does not appear for any reason,
the results are considered invalid and should not be interpreted. The sample should

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
See Clinical studies section below to see performance data for
samples around the cutoff.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
The device has an internal process control. Users are informed that
the control indicates that sufficient urine was added to the test. This
is typical of OTC tests. Users are also informed not to interpret the
test if the control line does not form.
d. Detection limit:
Performance Characteristics have been addressed in k050186
(Ameditech Immutest Drug Screen Cup).
e. Analytical specificity:
Performance Characteristics have been addressed in k050186
(Ameditech Immutest Drug Screen Cup).
f. Analytical specificity:
Performance Characteristics have been addressed in k050186
(Ameditech Immutest Drug Screen Cup).
g. Assay cut-off:
The cutoff concentrations for methamphetamine, THC, cocaine
metabolites, amphetamines, opiates and PCP are recommended by
the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
(SAMHSA).
SAMHSA has not recommended a cutoff concentration for
barbiturates, benzodiazepines, methadone, tricyclic antidepressants,
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, and oxycodone. The cutoff
concentrations for these drugs are the same as the cutoff
concentrations in k050186, the predicate device.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a and b are not applicable):
A consumer study was conducted to determine the device’s
performance when used by untrained users following the instructions
in the labeling. A questionnaire was used to determine if the
untrained users understood the purpose of the test, the conditions for
its use, the test’s limitations, and the meaning of the results. 250
untrained users read a total of 5,760 assays during the study and
5,731 of 5,760 assays (99.5%) was interpreted correctly. 480 unique
tests with sample solutions containing benzoylecgonine, morphine,
secobarbital, oxazepam, THC, nortriptyline, phencyclidine,
methadone, MDMA, amphetamine, and oxycodone were performed
by consumers using drug-free urine spiked with various
concentrations and combinations of drugs. Each drug was tested at
0%, 50%, 75%, 125%, 150%, and 200% of the target concentration.
Drug concentrations except for TCA were confirmed by GC/MS at a
SAMHSA laboratory; recovery ranged between 85.3 to 138.0% of
the target concentration. TCA was confirmed by HPLC at an
independent laboratory; recovery ranged between 84.3 to 121.2% of
the target concentration. Approximately 6.9% of the consumers had
used a home drug kit. 10.7% had not finished high school; 42.6%
were high school graduates; 34.3% had completed one year of
college; and 12/4% of the lay users were college graduates. The ratio
of female to male was approximately 2:1. The ages ranged from 18
to over 45 years. The study was conducted at three different
locations (Phoenix, AZ; Johnson City, NY; and Bemidji, MN)
The results of the study are summarized below:

*Twenty-six of twenty-nine incorrectly interpreted results that
were at target concentrations of ±25% (either 75% or 125% of the
cutoff). Three of twenty-nine incorrectly interpreted results
(amphetamines, opiates and methadone) that were at -50% of the
cutoff.
250 consumers were recruited. A consumer questionnaire was
administered to evaluate their experience with home drug tests and
labeling effectiveness. The following questions were asked: “Have
you purchased a home drug test?” Have you previously used a
home drug test?” “Was the test easy to run and were the results
easy to read?” “Does it matter how light or dark the colored line
is?” “If a sample tests positive for a prescription drug like TCA,
does that mean for certain that an individual is abusing that
prescription drug?” 2.8 % of the participants had purchased a
home drug test. 6.8% previously used a home drug test. 95.2% of
the participants said the test was easy to run and the results were
easy to read. 90.6% correctly stated that it does not matter how
dark or light a colored line is. 94.7% said if a sample tests positive
for a prescription drug it does not mean for certain that an
individual is abusing that prescription drug.
