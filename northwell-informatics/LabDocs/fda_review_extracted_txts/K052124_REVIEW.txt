K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
L. Test Principle:
The ACTICLOT dPT is a coagulation assay that identifies the presence of LA in plasma. Clotting is
initiated by activating the tissue factor (extrinsic) coagulation pathway with tissue factor in the presence of
calcium ions. Tissue Factor binds to Factor VIla resulting in the activation of Factor IX and Factor X.
Factor Xa converts prothrombin to thrombin which initiates clot formation by cleaving fibrinogen to fibrin.
Activation of the tissue factor pathway bypasses the activation of the contact intrinsic pathway and excludes
any interference from deficiencies of Factors XI and XII.
In the Screening Protocol, the patient plasma is mixed with the ACTICLOT LA Buffer" and ACTICLOT
dPT Activator". The clot time is determined by semi-automated or automated methods. A positive result is
indicated by a prolonged clot time relative to an established normal range, In the Confirmatory Protocol,
the patient plasma is mixed with the ACTICLOT LA Phospholipids" and ACTICLOT dPT Activator. A
positive result is indicated by a significant reduction of the clot time relative to the clot time in the screening
protocol.

Plasmas are identified as possessing LA when both the Screening and Confirmatory Protocols are performed
and both tests are positive.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
ACTICLOT dPT reagent precision studies were performed on two sites using LAtrol
Normal Control, LAtrol™ Abnormal Control, and various coagulation analyzers:
ACL® 300R centrifugal analyzer, BCT®, MLA® 900C coagulation analyzer, and the STA
Compact®. Testing involved multiple runs over several days. Results are as follows:

e. Analytical specificity:
Testing demonstrated interference with lipemic, icteric and
hemolysed samples.
Testing demonstrated no interference from unfractionated heparin up to
and including 1.0 U/mL.
The ACTICLOT® dPT™ screening time may be prolonged in patients
with congenital or acquired factor deficiencies. Eighteen known
Factor Deficiency patient plasmas were tested with ACTICLOT^ dPT
