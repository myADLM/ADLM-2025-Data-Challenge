The Bayer ADVIA IMS® Glucose method is for in vitro diagnostic device for use
to measure glucose in human serum, plasma (lithium heparin), urine and
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on the ADVIA IMS® system. Such measurements are
used as an aid in the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of carbohydrate
metabolism disorders including diabetes mellitus and neonatal hypoglycemia.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
This device is for prescription use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
ADVIA IMS® system
I. Device Description:
The ADVIA IMS® Glucose Assay is the same as that cleared under K000921. The
only change was to allow use of cerebrospinal fluid as a matrix.
The ADVIA IMS Glucose method reagent pack is sufficient for 1250 tests. The
reagent pack consists of R1, R2, and DIL 2. R1 is 20.5 mL solution containing
adenosine triphosphate and surfactant. R2 contains hexokinase (yeast), glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (L. mesenteroides), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide,
supplied lyophilized. DIL 2 is 21.0 mL of surfactant.

L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA IMS Glucose method is a colorimetric endpoint chemistry. The method
is based on the combination of hexokinase (HK) and glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PD) for the specific measurement of glucose. HK catalyzes the
phosphorylation of glucose using adenosine-5’-triphosphate (ATP). G6PD catalyzes
the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-mediated oxidation of glucose-6-
phosphate (G-6-P) to 6-phosphoglucono-δ-lactone (6-PG) with the concomitant
production of NADH. The amount of NADH produced is in direct proportion to the

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Imprecision was evaluated at specific analyte levels using control materials in
a protocol similar to that recommended in CLSI document EP5-A. The
controls were tested over 11 days and included 17 runs. The results were as
follows:
N Mean Within Run Total
(mg/dL) SD %CV SD %CV
Control 1 64 35.6 0.74 2.1 0.82 2.3
Control 2 65 60.2 1.28 2.1 1.35 2.2
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The assay range is 1 to 600 mg/dL (0.1 to 33.3 mmol/L). Five samples from
individual donors were pooled and divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was
spiked with pure glucose to achieve a final concentration of approximately
500 mg/dL. The two aliquots were then codiluted to produce three additional,
equally spaced levels. The five samples were then tested in duplicate on the
ADVIA IMS. A least squares fit was generated for the first three points. The
percent difference between the theoretical line and the actual recovery for the
five samples was then determined. The results showed -3.6% to 1.2%
deviation from the predicted value for all five samples (observed values: 65-
532 mg/dL).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ADVIA IMS Glucose method is traceable to the CDC Reference Method
using reference materials from the National Institute of Standards and
Technology via patient sample correlation.
Assigned values for calibrators and ranges of Assayed Chemistry Controls are
traceable to this standardization.
d. Detection limit:
The minimum detectable concentration (sensitivity) is 0.1 mmol/L (1 mg/dL).
This is based on 2 times the within-run standard deviation from at least 20
replicates of a sample containing no glucose.

e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity was established in predicate submissions. Also, the
sponsor noted that interfering substances are not expected in cerebrospinal
fluid samples.
f. Assay cut-off:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Correlation was evaluated with human CSF samples in a protocol similar to
that recommended in CLSI document EP9-A. A total of 64 samples, with
glucose concentrations ranging from 31 to 132 mg/dL (1.7 to 7.3 mmol/L),
were tested on both platforms. The regression equation was as follows:
y = 0.92 + 2.3 mg/dL, r = 0.997, (y = 0.92x + 0.13 mmol/L, r = 0.997)

to 80 mg/dL (3.3 to 4.4 mmol/L). The expected values/reference range for serum
or plasma is 60 to 121 mg/dL (3.3 to 6.7 mmol/L). The expected values/reference
range for urine is < 0.5 g/day (< 2.78 mmol/day).
