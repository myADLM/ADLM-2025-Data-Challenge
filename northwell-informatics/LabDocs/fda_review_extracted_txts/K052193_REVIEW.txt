I. Device Description:
The ISE Compensator is a ready-to-use calibrator. It is composed of a buffered
human serum matrix with defined concentrations of sodium, potassium, and chloride,
and added stabilizers. It is supplied in 10, 1 mL sized bottles.
The human serum used in the preparation of the ISE Compensator has been screened
by FDA approved methods and found to be negative for HBsAg and antibodies to
HCV and HIV.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: ISE Compensator is traceable to the reference material NIST-
SRM909b. The reference method is flame photometry for the sodium and
potassium analytes and coulometry for the chloride analyte. The value
assignment process takes place using multiple external laboratories and using
different Hitachi analyzers with ion selective electrodes. The final value
assigned to each analyte is lot specific and is found on the Value Sheet that is
provided with the product.
Stability: The shelf-life and open-vial stability of ISE Compensator when
stored at 2-8°C have been demonstrated using real time stability data and
predetermined acceptance criteria.
