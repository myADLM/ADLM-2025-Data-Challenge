The Accurex Test Strip, used together with the One Touch® Basic®, One Touch®
Profile®, and One Touch® II Meters, measures the blood glucose levels using a
membrane technology that employs a glucose oxidase/peroxidase reaction. The user
turns on the meter, enters the calibration code into the meter, removes a test strip
from the vial and inserts it in the meter, and applies a fresh sample of whole blood to
the test spot. The result is displayed on the One Touch meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Fifteen replicates from each of five glucose contrived whole blood samples
were analyzed on the One Touch Basic wide screen meter. As a control, each
whole blood sample was analyzed on the YSI clinical analyzer before and
shortly after replicate testing. The results were as follows:
YSI Accurex
mg/dL mg/dL %CV
42 44 3.2
135 135 3.2
254 257 3.5
377 361 2.3
486 469 3.1
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The assay reportable range is 3 to 600 mg/dL.
The linearity of the test strips was determined by testing ten replicates each of
five heparinized blood glucose levels contrived with glucose stock solution on
five randomly selected One Touch Basic meters. The true glucose values
were determined with the YSI 2300D clinical analyzer, with average levels of
6, 132, 304, 407, and 515 mg/dL.
The following regression resulted: y = 0.95x + 0.46, r2 = 0.99. The average
levels on the Accurex strips were 9.3, 121, 289, 394, and 489 mg/dL. All the
data points reside within the A zone of the Clarke error grid.
An additional study to support linearity between 489 and 600 mg/dL and to
include a sample between approximately 50-70 mg/dL was performed per
FDA’s request. As before, ten replicates each of two samples were tested.
The average reference results were 67 and 573 mg/dL, which were similar to
the average Accurex strip results of 67 and 563 mg/dL. The recalculated

regression including the additional data is as follows: y = 0.97 – 0.72, r2 =
0.996.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Accurex Control Solution is an aqueous material containing d-glucose,
preservatives, and pigment. The assigned glucose range is established in the
bulk and filled solutions. The assigned glucose range is based on the values
from single use vial testing data with a batch of strips run on ten One Touch
meters. The upper limit is equal to the average glucose value + 3SD. The
lower limit is equal to the average glucose value – 3SD. The labeled range is
71-105 mg/dL.
Accelerated and real time stability data were provided. Three lots of control
solution are stored at 40ºC and 75% relative humidity (accelerated) and 25ºC
and 50% relative humidity (real time) and tested at several time points.
Average glucose values and %CVs were calculated for up to 34 weeks.
Accelerated and real time data were adequate, with average glucose values
within the assigned range and CVs less than 5%.
The sponsor recommends in their labeling a second, higher, level of control
material that has been validated for use with this system.
d. Detection limit:
The minimum detection limit is 3 mg/dL. To evaluate low range sensitivity of
the Accurex strip, one lot was tested with five One Touch Basic meters.
Three replicates of four patient samples were run on each meter, and the
results were compared to the YSI 2300D clinical analyzer. The reference
values ranged from 3 to 46 mg/dL. Using the Accurex strips, the values
ranged from 3 to 43 mg/dL. The following regression resulted: y = 0.95 +
0.16, r2 = 0.99.
e. Analytical specificity:
Heparinized blood was first adjusted to a normal glucose level with a glucose
stock solution. Then an aliquot of the resulting blood sample was spiked with
various concentrations of commonly known interfering substances
(endogenous and exogenous). The potential interference was evaluated with
five randomly selected One Touch Basic meters.
No interference was observed with Gentisic, Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen,
Salicylate, bilirubin, uric acid, Tolbutamide, Tolazamide, L-dopa, and lipids.
The results showed that sodium fluoride causes a significant drop in glucose
values at an elevated level. Therefore, tubes containing sodium fluoride or
other forms of fluoride salts or conjugates are not appropriate for collection of
5

specimen to be used with this test. Strong antioxidants such as ascorbic acid
also showed notable decreases in glucose values at high levels.
Hematocrit values between 30% and 55% do not interfere with the results of
this assay.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
A clinical study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the Accurex
Glucose Test Strip in comparison to the predicate device. One hundred and
forty (140) subjects, with 1 month to 57 years of experience using a
glucometer to monitor their glucose levels, participated in the study. Subjects
were given a box of predicate strips, a box of Accurex strips, and two One
Touch Basic glucometers (strips and glucometers included instructions) and
instructed to perform testing with both strips. A capillary sample was also
obtained by the clinic personnel to perform a reference assay using the YSI
2300D clinical analyzer. Subjects and a trained observer were asked to fill out
a questionnaire recording the results they obtained and comments.
The results were as follows:

Accurex Predicate
# Patients 124 125
Correlation Coefficient (r) 0.98 0.96
Slope 0.96 0.89
Intercept 2.1 mg/dL 7.4 mg/dL
For the subject device, 7% of the samples were not included due to low blood
sample, incorrect strip insertion or incorrect blood application. Three percent
(3%) of the samples were not included due to low sample volume errors with
the clinical analyzer.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected whole blood glucose levels that the sponsor provides in the labeling
for people without diabetes are based on literature.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
