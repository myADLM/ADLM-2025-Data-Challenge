1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Glucose Pilot Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for the quantitative
measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from a fingerstick, for the lay-
user. It is also intended for the professional use, which include fresh capillary whole
blood. It is intended for use outside the body (in vitro diagnostics use) by diabetics at
home and clinical settings as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Not to be used for neonatal testing
4. Special instrument requirements:
Glucose Pilot Meter
I. Device Description:
The Glucose Pilot Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the Glucose Pilot meter,
Glucose Pilot test strips, lancet device and control solutions and user manual. To measure
blood glucose, the user inserts a test strip. A numerical code appears on the screen and the
user compares this number to the number located on the test strip bottle to ensure the two
numbers match. Once the user confirms that the code number in the meter matches the strip
bottle, glucose testing can proceed. The user applies a blood drop from the fingerstick to the
test strip. The meter initiates the test which completes in five seconds. Results are stored in
the meters memory for tracking purposes.

L. Test Principle:
The Glucose Vision Meter measures the electronic current generated from the reaction of
glucose with the chemical reagents impregnated into disposable electrode. Glucose in the
blood sample reacts with glucose oxidase in the test strip, liberating electrons that produce a
micro-current. The intensity of the current, as measured by the meter, correlates with the
concentration of glucose in the sample. The measured current is electronically converted and
displayed digitally on the meter’s LCD as units of glucose in mg/dL (or mmol/L).

Repeatability (within run) was assessed by taking venous blood samples that were
treated with EDTA and spiking these samples to generate 5 different levels of glucose
concentration for the test. Each sample was measured 10 times by one operator on 10
different meters using one lot number in one day. Results are summarized below:
Samples N Mean mg/dL SD CV %
Level 1
100 45.4 4.3 9.5%
30-50 mg/dL

The sponsor prepared three control solutions of Low, Normal and High. Each of the
controls was measured 10 times a day for 10 days using 10 meters and multiple
operators. Results are summarized below:
Control Sample N Mean mg/dL SD CV %
Low 100 45.4 4.2 9.3%
Normal 100 119.5 4.3 3.6%
High 100 347.5 16.7 4.8%
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the glucose measurements was demonstrated by comparing six
prepared whole blood samples on the Glucose Vision meter and a glucose reference
method. The six samples ranged in concentration from a low of approximately 22.7
mg/dL to a high of approximately 579 mg/dL. Linear regression of the comparison
data yielded the following relationship:
Glucose Vision = (0.986 X Reference Method) -0.154 mg/dL
r2 = 0.9987
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Two levels of control material are provided for use with the test system and are
traceable to NIST and NBS standards. Values are assigned to the controls by
comparing to a glucose reference method. The shelf life and in use stability were
tested and verified.

exogenous substances. A summary of the data is presented below:

Hemoglobin 2.5 50
Triglyceride <190 500
Uric Acid 7.0 10
The meter was tested at a higher altitude to assess the effect of low oxygen levels on
the meters performance. No effect on performance was found when twenty five finger
stick samples of different levels of blood were tested up to 11,967 ft. higher
elevations were not tested. The sponsor presented data that supported using the test
system between 10ºC to 40ºC.
Hematocrit Effect:
The effect of sample hemoglobin variation on the Glucose Pilot test system was
tested experimentally by preparing samples of known hematocrit and spiking aliquots
of these samples with three different levels of glucose. These samples were run on the
Glucose Pilot and YSI; there was less than a +13% bias across the claimed range of

3. Clinical studies:
The consumer study was performed at five POC sites with a total of 257 lay-users. The
lay-users ranged in age, education and were equally divided between males and females;
and equally divided between type-1 and type-2 diabetes, although not all participants
have diabetes. Each participant performed their own fingerstick and tested their blood
using the instructions in the User’s guide. A trained professional then performed another
fingerstick and tested the blood on the same meter. Blood was collected and measured on
an YSI analyzer. The results are presented below.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The normal fasting adult glucose range for a non-diabetic is 70 -110 mg/dL. One-hour
after a meal, normal blood glucose results should be less the 160 mg/dL. A medical
professional should determine the range that is appropriate for diabetes patients.
N. Instrument Name:
Glucose Pilot Blood Glucose Monitoring System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes __X___ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip. For
capillary whole blood, since the sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no
special handling or storage issues.

--- Page 8 ---
5. Calibration:
Each bottle of test strips as a code number which is used to calibrate the meter. The user
confirms that the code number on the test strip bottle matches the code number in the
instrument. If they are different then the user changes the number by depressing the S
button on the meter until the correct number is displayed. No further calibrations are
required of the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor is providing a high and low glucose control solution with this device. To
mark the test result as a control the user, after the units of measure is displayed is
instructed to press and hold the S button until CTL appears on the display. This prevents
control results from being stored in the internal memory. An acceptable range for each
control level is printed on the test strip vial label. If control results fall outside these
ranges, the user is referred to a list of troubleshooting steps and the customer care line.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
