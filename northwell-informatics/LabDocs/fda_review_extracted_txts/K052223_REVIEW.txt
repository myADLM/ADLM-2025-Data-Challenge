H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Access EPO assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent
immunoassay for the quantitative determination of erythropoietin levels in human
serum and plasma (heparin) using the Access Immunoassay Systems. This assay
is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of anemias and polycythemias. With the
advent of the administration of recombinant erythropoietin as a biologic therapy
to increase red blood cell mass, an erythropoietin assay may be used also to aid in
the prediction and monitoring of response to recombinant erythropoietin treatment
in persons with anemias.
The Access EPO calibrators are intended to calibrate the Access EPO assay for
the quantitative determination of EPO levels in human serum and plasma
(heparin) using the Access Immunoassay Systems.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as above.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Not applicable.
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use with the Access family of Immunoassay analyzers (Access, Access 2,
Synchron LX®i 725, UniCel DxI 800, UniCel DxC 600i)
I. Device Description:
The AccessEPO assay consists of the reagent pack and calibrators. The reagent pack
consist of three specific reagents; (1) Paramagnetic particles coated with goat anti-
mouse IgG: mouse anti-recombinant human EPO monoclonal antibody, BSA, sodium
azide and ProClin 300, (2) Chicken anti-recumbent mouse alkaline phosphatase
(bovine) conjugate, BSA, 0.1% sodium aide and 0.7% ProClin 300, (3) TRIS saline
buffer containing BSA, proteins (chicken, bovine, mouse), <0.1% sodium azide and
0.17% ProClin 300. Two reagent packs containing 50 tests per pack are provide for a
total of 100 assay determinations. The calibrator kit provides calibrators at 6 levels:
zero (S0) and approximately 5, 25, 125, 375, 750ml mIU/ml (S1 – S5) and one
Calibration Card. The S0 calibrator vial contains 10 ml and each S1 – S5 vial contains

2.5mL. Other items needed to perform the assay include the Access substrate and
wash buffers for use with the Access family of Immunoassay Analyzers in the clinical
laboratory.

L. Test Principle:
The Access EPO assay is a two-site immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay. A sample
is added to a reaction vessel along with the paramagnetic particles coated with mouse
monoclonal anti-EPO blocking reagent and the alkaline phosphatase conjugate. After
incubation in a reaction vessel, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a
magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the
chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phos 530 is added to the vessel and light generated
by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is directly
proportion to the concentration of EPO in the sample. The amount of analyte in the
sample is determined from a stored, multi-point calibration curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was performed using patient samples and three levels of
controls (0-10, 10-100, 100-500 mIU/mL), in duplicate, for 20 runs,
completing 2 runs per day, for at least 10 day. The assay exhibits total
precision of < 10% CV at EPO concentrations greater than 3 mIU/mL. Assay
precision was tested at concentrations from approximately 9 to 475 mIU/mL.
The within-run imprecision ranged from 1.8% CV to 8.7% CV. Total
imprecision ranged from 2.6% CV to 8.7% CV.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Dilution recovery studies were performed by diluting multiple human serum
and plasma (heparin) samples at various levels with Access EPO Calibrator
S0. Sample mean recovery values for all serum and plasma samples were
within the range of 100 ± 15%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
EPO reagents are stable for 28 days after opening and calibrators are stable for
90 days after opening. The calibration curve is stable for 28 days.
The measurand in the Access EPO Calibrators is traceable to the WHO
Second IRP (67/343) a urine-derived form of human erythropoietin.
Tractability process is based on EN ISO 17511.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit was determined by processing a six point calibration
curve, controls, and ten replicates of zero calibrator in multiple assays. The
lowest detectable level of EPO distinguishable from zero (Access EPO
Calibrator S0) with 95% confidence is ≤0.6 mIU/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The Access EPO assay was tested using spiked samples for interference of
normal human blood constituents [hemoglobin, triglycerides (triolein),
bilirubin and human serum albumin], heparin, and commonly encountered
medications (acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, multi vitamins).
A cross-reactivity study was also performed of compounds with similar
molecular structure. The assay exhibited no significant interference or cross
reactivity with these substances or compounds.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
An internal and external study was performed with the Access EPO and RDS
Quantikine ELISA assays. The internal study included apparently healthy
adults and adults with elevated EPO concentration levels. The external study
included normal subjects, subjects diagnosed with anemia or polycythemias,
subjects on erythropoietin therapy, and procured or spiked samples. Samples
6

--- Page 7 ---
for both tests were selected to cover the predicate assay range (2.5 – 200
mIU/mL). The results are as follows:
Internal Site Study: Slope of 1.0511, intercept of –1.3595, and correlation
coefficient (r) of 0.988. For this study N=103 with an EPO concentration
range of approximately 3 to 182 mIU/mL.
External Site Study: Slope of 1.1216, intercept of –2.4168, and correlation
coefficient (r) of 0.995. For this study N=113 with an EPO concentration
range of approximately 3 to 193 mIU/mL.
b. Matrix comparison:
A comparison study was performed using matched serum and plasma
(heparin) samples and three matched serum and plasma samples, each spiked
with four different concentrations of erythropoietin to obtain samples with
concentrations throughout the analytical range of the assay. The results as
follows met the design specification.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Serum and plasma (heparin) samples were obtained from 122 apparently healthy
adults in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area in Minnesota and analyzed.
The result below was based on 95% non parametric analysis of normal samples:

It is noted in the package insert that “the EPO concentration is in normal
individuals can be affected by altitude, pregnancy and other factors” and
recommended that each laboratory establish its own reference ranges to assure
proper representation of specific populations.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
