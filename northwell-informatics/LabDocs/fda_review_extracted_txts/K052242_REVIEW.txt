Stability Reconstituted, capped Reconstituted urine
and stored at 2-8º C stable controls are stable for 8
for 28 days hours at 25º C and 5 days
24 months shelf life at 4º C if kept capped in
original container and
free from contamination
or 14 days at -20º C
Levels Two levels Same
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were referenced in the submission.
L. Test Principle:
Not Applicable
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The value assignment of the Controls for the two levels were done by a
Fitness-For-Use (FFU) study over a period of 4 days. The FFU data was
collected with two lots of the Reagents, Calibrators and Controls on two
ADVIA ® 1650 systems for a total of 128 replicates.
The mean System Specific Values (SSVs) of the two Controls, Level 1 and 2,
were then validated by value assignment using a nested testing protocol on the
ADVIA ® 1650. The nested tested derived mean SSVs compared well with
FFU derived mean SSVs and were within 4.8%.

The FFU study was also done on the ADVIA ® 2400 and 1200 systems to
compare the 1650 derived mean SSVs with the SSVs derived on the ADVIA ®
1200 and the ADVIA ® 2400.
Shelf life stability: 24 months.
Open vial stability: 28 days at 2 to 8º C.
