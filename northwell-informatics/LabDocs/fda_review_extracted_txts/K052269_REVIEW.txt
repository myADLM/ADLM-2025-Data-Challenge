bacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae and non –
Enterobacteriaceae and gram-positive bacteria belonging to the genera
Staphylococcus and Enterococcus.

For prescription use only
Results for S. maltophilia have been excluded in the BD Phoenix™ therefore no
results will be reported. An alternate method should be performed when this
combination is identified.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST
Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and
equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™
Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST broth, which contains an AST
indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST broth is a cation-adjusted formulation
of Mueller-Hinton broth containing 0.01% Tween 80. After adding the indicator solution
to the AST inoculum the color is blue and after inoculation and incubation goes to pink to
colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned
and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System instrument where
the panels are continuously incubated at 350C. The AST has a final inoculum of 5 x 105
CFU/ml. The instrument incubates, reads and records the results of the biochemical
substrates and antimicrobial agents and interprets the reactions to give an ID of the isolate
and MIC value and category interpretation of the antimicrobial agents. Organisms
growing in the presence of a given antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator, signaling
2

organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or inhibited
by a given antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do not
produce a color change. Additional interpretation is done using software driven
“EXPERT” System using rules derived from the NCCLS documentation.
Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an ID result available between 2-12 hours and
an AST result available between 4-16 hours. This is only an autoread result; there are no
manual readings possible.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S15) “Methods for
Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard.”
L. Test Principle:
The system employs conventional, colorimetric, fluorogenic and chromogenic
substrates to identify the genus and species of the isolate. The AST portion of the BD
Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth based microdilution method
that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance detection
of organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells
containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control
wells” which contains no antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Ten isolates were evaluated for site to site and inter site reproducibility and
demonstrated >95% reproducibility. The ten isolate study described in the
guidance document was followed, (10 organisms tested 3 times on 3 days at 3
sites).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The FDA and CLSI recommended QC isolates, E. coli ATCC 25922 and P.
aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were tested on every test occasion with the
reference method and the BD Phoenix™. The reference method QC results
were in range for every day tested. The BD Phoenix™ was tested a sufficient
number of times to demonstrate that the system can produce QC results in the

CLSI recommended ranges. The BD Phoenix™ and reference method had the
same mode for E. coli ATCC 25922 but had a different mode with P.
aeruginosa ATCC 27853 where BD Phoenix™ was one dilution higher than
the reference method but still in the acceptable range.

EA-Essential Agreement maj-major discrepancies
CA-Category Agreement vmj-very major discrepancies
R-resistant isolates min- minor discrepancies
Essential agreement (EA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panels agree with the
reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference
method. Category agreement (CA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panel result
interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation.
Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the BD Phoenix™ and
the reference and have on-scale EA.
There appears to be a trend where the test device is slightly more resistant than the
reference device as reflected in one of the QC studies and the Accuracy studies
however results are still within essential agreement.
