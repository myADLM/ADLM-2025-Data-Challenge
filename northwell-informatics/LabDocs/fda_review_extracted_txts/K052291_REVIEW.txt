4. Panel:
Hematology (81)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The CAPILLARYS HEMOGLOBIN(E) kit is designed for the separation of the normal
hemoglobins (A, F and A2) and for the detection of the major hemoglobin variants
(especially S, C, E or D), by electrophoresis in alkaline buffer (pH 9.4) with the
CAPILLARYS System. The CAPILLARYS performs all sequences automatically to
obtain a complete hemoglobin profile for qualitative or quantitative analysis of
hemoglobins. The assay is performed on red blood cells.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The CAPILLARYS HEMOGLOBIN(E) kit is designed for the detection and the
characterization of hemoglobins in human blood with the Sebia CAPILLARYS system,
for capillary electrophoresis. The CAPILLARYS performs all procedural sequences
automatically to obtain a hemoglobin profile. The CAPILLARYS system automatically
mixes the blood sample with hemolysing solution. The hemoglobins, separated in silica
capillaries, are directly detected by their absorbance at 415 nm. The electrophoregrams
are evaluated visually for the pattern abnormalities. Direct detection of the hemoglobins
provides relative quantification of individual hemoglobin fraction of the normal
hemoglobin fractions A, A2, F and for the detection of major hemoglobin variants as S,
C, E and D using Capillarys electrophoresis. For in vitro diagnostic use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Not applicable.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable.
I. Device Description:
The CAPILLARYS HEMOGLOBIN(E) kit consist of five components; (1) CAPILLARYS
HEMOGLOBIN(E) buffer contains alkaline buffer (pH 9.4),supplied in 700mL vials, (2)

L. Test Principle:
The CAPILLARYS system uses the principle of capillary electrophoresis in a free solution.
With this technique, charged molecules are separated by their electrophoretic mobility in an
alkaline buffer with a specific pH. Separation also occurs according to the electrolyte pH and
electroosmotic flow. The CAPILLARYS system has capillaries functioning in parallel
allowing 7 simultaneous analyses for hemoglobin quantification. A sample dilution with
hemolyzing solution is prepared and injected by aspiration at the anodic end of the capillary.
A high voltage protein separation is then performed and direct detection of the hemoglobins
is made at 415 nm at the cathodic end of the capillary. The resulting electrophoregrams are
evaluated visually for pattern abnormalities. By using alkaline pH buffer, normal and
abnormal (or variant) hemoglobins are detected.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Five different blood samples (normal blood 1; blood 2 with increased Hb A2; bloods
3 and 4 with Hb F; blood 5 with increased Hb A2, Hb F and S component) were run
seven times with two lots of analysis buffer.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was conducted using two blood samples (Control 1: normal Hb A and Hb
A2 and Control 2: abnormal elevated Hb A2, Hb S and Hb F). The two control
samples were mixed at different concentration. Linearity was determined for each
fraction (Hb A, Hb A2, Hb S and Hb F). In addition, two blood samples were
obtained containing different total hemoglobin concentration values of 10.6 g/dl and
12.5 g/dl. The samples were run neat, diluted 2, 3, and 5. The results demonstrated
satisfactory linearity within the entire range of 2.1 – 12.5 g/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability studies were performed with the CAPILLARYS HEMOGLOBIN(E) kit for
samples containing anticoagulants, EDTA, citrate and heparin. Samples were stored
for up to 7 days between 2 – 8o C. The percent of each fraction (HbA, HbF, HbS,
HbA2 and Hb delta A’2) was measured. All three anticoagulants were found
acceptable.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Comparison studies were preformed, with the use of the HPLC system, for Hb A2,
Hb F, and Hb S on blood samples (with normal and elevated levels). The results are
as follows:
Hb N R2 y-intercept Slope Range of %
fraction values
Hb A2 66 0.947 0.146 0.908 1.6 – 6.0
Hb F 74 0.995 -0.339 0.968 0.0 – 44.9
Hb S 43 0.994 1.769 1.005 9.1 – 92.7
An additional study was performed on seventy (75) blood samples with
hemoglobin variants, such as hemoglobin S, C, and E. This study also
included the comparison of Hemoglobin A (Hb A). Gel confirmation studies
were conducted on all samples tested.
Hemoglobin D studies were not conducted due to infrequency of the hemoglobin
variant and sample availability.
All abnormal hemoglobins or abnormal levels detected were in agreement with the
comparative method, hospital results and clinical diagnosis.
The blood samples and their diagnostic assessment used for all studies were provided
by hospitals in Europe. The diagnosis was based on HPLC and/or on a routine
alkaline gel and acid gel electrophoresis.
