K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
L. Test Principle:
A mixture of biotinylated TSH-specific antibody and TSH antibody labeled with alkaline
phosphatase reacts with TSH from the patient’s sample forming a “sandwich” complex in
the mixture. Streptavidin-coated paramagnetic particles are added to the reaction
mixture. Wash steps remove unbound materials. Chemiluminogenic substrate is added
to the bound complex and results in “glow” chemiluminescence measured in the
FastPack® System. The amount of “glow” from the bound labeled-antibody is directly
proportional to the concentration of TSH in the sample. The concentration is
extrapolated from a standard curve generated from calibrators (sold separately) and
verified by controls (sold separately).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three patient plasma pools were assayed over 10 days. The assays were run in duplicate
on three analyzers using two lots of reagents. Results for precision are summarized
below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
For the calibrator, a master curve is generated in the factory for each lot of the FastPack
reagents. The 6-point master curve is generated using master calibrators referenced to the
WHO 2nd IRP 80/558 standard. The master curve information is transferred to the
FastPack System through the barcode on the FastPack.
For the control, TSH antigen is procured as a purified powder (>90%). An antigen stock
is prepared by adding the purified powder to a Tris buffer containing bovine serum
albumin, and sucrose. The intermediate stock is used to prepare the final concentration of
TSH in the calibrator/control matrix. The values are assigned using standards
(Monobind, Inc.) traceable to the WHO 2nd IRP 80/558 standard.
The calibrator and control stability was tested using five different accelerated stability
testing groups each with samples being tested at 30°C and 37°C. Based on the
accelerated stability data, twelve month stability at 2-8°C is claimed for the TSH
calibrators and controls. Real-time studies will continue to confirm and extend the
dating.
d. Detection limit:
Functional sensitivity was determined by measuring twenty-seven plasma samples on
three FastPack instruments using two lots of TSH FastPack assayed over a period of one
week. The concentration at which assay imprecision was calculated to be 20 % CV (by
interpolation) is 0.13 µIU/mL.
The analytical sensitivity, defined as the lowest signal that can be distinguished from the
zero standard by 2 standard deviations, was assessed by measuring 10 replicates on three
FastPack instruments using two reagent lots of the zero level calibrator. The analytical
sensitivity was determined to be 0.01 µIU/mL.
The potential for a high dose hook effect was evaluated for this assay by spiking a human
serum standard that had been completely depleted of TSH. Spiking ranged from 0

µIU/mL to 5000 µIU/mL. No effect was observed at 5000 µIU/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
To test the crossreactivity of this device to similar endogenous analytes, plasma samples
were spiked with hCG, LH, and FSH at 200000, 500, and 500 mIU/mL, respectively, and
compared to a non-spiked base pool. No analytes tested significantly cross-reacted in this
analysis as the cross-reactivity was shown to be 0.00% for all analytes.
A patient sample was spiked with specific concentrations of potential interfering
substances, and the TSH values were obtained using the FastPack® TSH Immunoassay.
No interference was found. Results are summarized below.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical samples (n=96 obtained as frozen plasma samples through outside laboratories)
were tested using the device and the predicate and compared. Results were determined
using linear regression and are summarized below.
Device = 1.03(Predicate) + 0.83; r = 0.97
b. Matrix comparison:
A heparin plasma pool from four patients was aliquoted into four equal portions which
were then spiked with TSH to produce final concentrations of 0.5, 2.5, 5.0, and 20.0
µIU/mL. These samples as well as the original pool were then assayed for TSH using the
FastPack System and the FastPack TSH Immunoassay to determine the percent
recoveries of the spiked TSH. Results are summarized below.
