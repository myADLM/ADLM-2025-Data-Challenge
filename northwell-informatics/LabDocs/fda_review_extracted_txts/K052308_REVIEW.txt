K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle:
The ARCHITECT Anti-Tg assay is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative
determination of the IgG class of thyroglobulin autoantibodies (anti-Tg) in human
serum and plasma using CMIA technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to
as Chemiflex®. In the first step, sample, assay diluent and Tg coated paramagnetic
microparticles are combined and incubated. Anti-Tg present in the sample binds to
the Tg coated microparticles. After washing, anti-human IgG acridinium labeled
conjugate is added in the second step. Following another incubation and wash, pre-
trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting
chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). A direct
relationship exists between the amount of anti-Tg in the sample and the RLUs
detected by the ARCHITECT i* system optics.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The ARCHITECT Anti-Tg assay was design to have an assay precision of ≤
10% CV for samples ≥ 4.0 IU/ml. ARCHITECT Anti-Tg positive control and
four human panels (covering the analytical range) were assayed using three
lots of reagents in replicates of two at two separate times per day for 20 days
in 3 instruments (n=5). Each reagent lot used a single calibration curve
throughout the study. Samples concentrations are described below:
Control = ~ 150 IU/ml
Panel 1 = ~ 4 IU/ml
Panel 2 = ~ 17 IU/ml
Panel 5 = ~ 400 IU/ml
Panel 6 = ~ 750 IU/ml
The replicate measurements statistically determine the product’s precision of
reproducibility and repeatability: total and within-run precision statistics for
the assays label claim. The values for within-run % CV were 2%-6% and for
the Total % CV values were 2.8%-6.1%. The results indicated that all three
reagent lots on each instrument performed within the acceptance criteria on
assay precision of ≤ 10% CV.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Three high sample pools (1000, 300, and 30 IU/mL) were each combined with
a low pool (ARCHITECT Anti-Tg Calibrator A) to prepare nine sets of test
dilutions extending to 1/10th the starting concentration. All of these dilutions

were analyzed with the ARCHITECT Anti-Tg assay using a single reagent lot.
Based on this study, the ARCHITECT Anti-Tg assay is linear between 3.0 and
1000.0 IU/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ARCHITECT Anti-TG Calibrators are standardized to the NIBSC 65/093
reference preparation. The ARCHITECT Anti-TG Primary Reference
Calibrator was produced by gravimetric dilutions of NIBSC 65/093. The
Anti-Tg Stock Concentrate with an assigned NIBSC value is used to produce
the ARCHITECT Anti-Tg Master Calibrator.
d. Detection limit:
The ARCHITECT Anti-Tg assay is designed to have an analytical sensitivity
of ≤ 1.0 IU/mL. The analytical sensitivity of the ARCHITECT Anti-Tg assay,
defined as the concentration at two standard deviations above the
ARCHITECT Anti-Tg Calibrator A (0.0 IU/mL) was calculated to be 0.07
IU/mL at the 95% level of confidence (n=48 runs, 10 replicates of Calibrator
A and 4 replicates of Calibrator B per run).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference
Interference from elevated levels of bilirubin, hemoglobin, triglycerides,
and total protein in the ARCHITECT Anti-Tg assay is designed to be
≤15% at the levels indicated. Specimens with anti-Tg levels between
53.41 and 320.25 IU/mL were supplemented with the potentially
interfering compounds described below. The average amount of
interference observed during the study ranged from 3.8% to +1.7%.
Potential interference from autoimmune disease specimens and high titer
IgG samples in the ARCHITECT Anti-Tg assay is designed to be ≤20%.
In a study, the ARCHITECT Anti-Tg assay was evaluated by testing
specimens with known autoimmune diseases and elevated IgG.
Specimens were evaluated with anti-Tg levels spiked between 175.58 and
235.86 IU/mL. Mean absolute % interference is summarized in the
following table:

f. Assay cut-off:
A cut-off value of 4.11 was observed for ARCHITECT as established in the
Normal Range Study.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
This specimen data (n=204) along with data from 30 specimens above 1000
IU/mL are the basis for the Concordance table summarized in the proposed
Package Insert. The agreement between the new device and the predicate is
97.0%. The Concordance Table conveys the relationship between the
ARCHITECT anti-Tg and the Nichols.

b. Matrix comparison:
The new device and the predicate were compared using serum as the matrix.
However, the new device can also use plasma.
Serum vs. Plasma Anticoagulant Studies
Plasma samples were collected in different anticoagulants in either glass or
plastic collection tubes (glass and plastic) and compared to matched serum
samples from the same donor. Twenty-Two donors were evaluated in each of
the nine listed tube types:
• EDTA Glass Tube vs. Serum Uncoated Tube
• EDTA Plastic Tube vs. Serum Uncoated Tube
• Lithium Heparin Glass Tube vs. Serum Uncoated Tube
• Lithium Heparin Plastic Tube vs. Serum Uncoated Tube
• Plasma Separator Lithium Heparin Glass Tube vs. Serum Uncoated Tube
• Plasma Separator Lithium Heparin Plastic Tube vs. Serum Uncoated Tube
• Sodium Heparin Glass Tube vs. Serum Uncoated Tube
• Sodium Heparin Plastic Tube vs. Serum Uncoated Tube.
The mean percentage interference was less than 10% for all anticoagulant
collection tube types when compared to glass serum tubes. The average
absolute interference of the individual specimens across all anticoagulants
ranged from 1.1 to 1.9% for all twenty-one-donor specimens within the assay

range. One donor produced values that exceeded the upper end of the assay
range (>1000 IU/mL) and was eliminated from further analysis. The actual
interference with anticoagulants ranged from -5.1% to 4.0% for all 21 donor
specimens within the assay range.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Clinical Specificity:
Two hundred and thirty four serum samples from individuals with Grave’s
disease (n=85) and Hashimoto’s disease (n=68), including 81 serum samples
from apparently normal individuals were tested with both the ARCHITECT
Anti-Tg assay and the Nichols Advantage Thyroglobulin Autoantibodies
Assay. Using a cutoff of 4.11 IU/ml for the ARCHITECT and 1 IU/ml for the
Nicholas Advantage, the following clinical sensitivities and specificities were
found:

To determine the Clinical Specificity 81 serum samples from normal
individuals were tested in the ARCHITECT. The results indicated that the
Clinical Specificity of the ARCHITECT Anti-Tg assay is 97.5%.
b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Same as assay cut-off.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Human serum specimens were collected from a population of 234 apparently
healthy individuals. All specimens delivered TSH values within the normal
reference range. Of this study population, 6 specimens delivered positive results
on a commercially available anti-Tg assay device and were excluded from further
analysis. The 97.5 percentile concentration of the remaining population was 4.11
IU/mL. On the basis of this study population, the expected normal range is <4.11
IU/mL. A total of 97.8% (223/228) of the population gave values within this
expected normal range. This normal range is suggested as a guideline and each
laboratory should establish a normal range appropriate to their patient
populations, giving due consideration to age, gender, geographical location and
their clinical practice.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
