866.1645 Short-Term Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test System
2. Classification:

3. Product Code:
LON System, Test, Automated, Antimicrobial Susceptibility, Short Incubation
4. Panel:
83 Microbiology
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Tigecycline at concentrations at 0.75, 2, and 4 is intended to be used on the
VITEK®2 Gram Negative susceptibility Card with the VITEK® 2 Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Test (AST) on the VITEK 2 System in clinical laboratories as an
in vitro test to determine the susceptibility of clinically significant aerobic gram
negative bacilli to antimicrobial agents.
The VITEK® 2 Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) with the VITEK® 2
System is intended for the automated quantitative or qualitative susceptibility
testing of isolated colonies for the most clinically significant aerobic gram-
negative bacilli, and gram positive organisms: Staphylococcus spp.,
Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, and S. pneumoniae when used as
instructed in the Online Product Information.
2. Indication(s) for use:
This submission is for the addition of the antibiotic Tigecycline at
concentrations at 0.75, 2, and 4 for a calling range of <0.5->8ug/mL to the

Page 2 of 5
VITEK®2 gram negative susceptibility CARD for the testing of appropriate
Enterobacteriaceae.
3. Special condition for use statement(s):
Prescription Use only.
The ability of the AST card to detect resistance among Enterobacteriaceae with
Tigecycline is unknown because resistant strains among the Enterobacteriaceae
tested were not available at the time of comparative testing.
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Not applicable
I. Device Description:
Each VITEK® 2 test card contains 64 microwells. A control well, that contains only
microbiological culture medium is resident on all cards, with the remaining wells
containing premeasured amounts of a specific antibiotic combined with culture
medium. A suspension of organism is made in 0.45 % sterile saline from a pure
culture and standardized to a McFarland 0.5 standard using the DensiChek. The
desired card (s) are placed in the cassette along with an empty tube for the
susceptibility card. The cassette is placed into the VITEK® 2 instrument where a
susceptibility test will be automatically diluted from the ID suspension by the
VITEK® 2. The cards are then automatically vacuum filled; the tubes are cut and the
cards sealed prior to proceeding to the incubator/reader for incubation (35.5o C) and
optical scanning during testing. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) readings
are performed every 15 minutes.
There is also an alternate manual dilution method of the organism that is
recommended in the package insert.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S15) “Methods
for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
Optics systems use visible light to directly measure organism growth. These
transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant
growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure
organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through the well. An
interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for an early reading of results with
an option to incubate up to 18 hours if necessary. The VITEK®2 Susceptibility Card
test is based on the microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration technique with
concentrations equivalent to standard method concentrations. Several parameters
based on the growth characteristics observed are used to provide appropriate input for
the MIC calculations. Discriminate analysis is used to develop the algorithm that
determines the susceptibility result for all antimicrobials on the VITEK® 2 system.
The MIC result must be linked to an organism identification in order to determine a
category interpretation. A category interpretation will be reported.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Ten on-scale gram negative organisms were tested in triplicate at
each of three sites for three days for an overall inter and intra-
reproducibility of >95%. This testing was performed using both the
manual dilution of the inoculum and also the automatic dilution
method with acceptable results for both.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the
auto-dilution and the manual method of diluting the organisms. This
included the one recommended QC organism with the following
results.

Inoculum density control: Internal verification of the DensiChek
was performed using 2 ATCC organisms and five instruments with
50 results available for each organism. The clinical sites also
performed weekly standardization of the DensiChek used at that site.
All recorded calibrated values were within acceptable parameters.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A comparison of the clinical data was performed to the agar
dilution reference method described in the CLSI M7 Standard.
Enterobacteriaceae were tested at three sites that included both
clinical and challenge isolates. All of the test organisms that
provided results did so in <16 hours. Testing was performed using
the auto dilution feature. The overall performance is listed in the
table below:
total CA %CA #R min maj vmj
Clinical 321 302 94.1 5 17 2 0
Challenge 73 60 82.2 2 11 2 0
Combined 394 362 91.9% 7 28 4 0
maj - major discrepancies
CA-Category Agreement vmj-very major discrepancies
R-resistant isolates min- minor discrepancies
CA is when the interpretation of the VITEK ® 2 result agrees exactly
with the interpretation of the reference method. Essential agreement at
the time of clearance was not established because less than five discrete
dilutions of the antibiotic were evaluated. A minimum of five dilutions
is necessary to perform essential agreement (EA) based on +/- one two
fold dilution. The CA was acceptable for a break-point [sensitive-
intermediate-resistant (SIR)] categorization.
Challenge testing:
The challenge set of organisms was also tested at one site using the
manual and automated methods of inoculation with the following
performance that demonstrated that there was little or no difference
between the two inoculation methods.
