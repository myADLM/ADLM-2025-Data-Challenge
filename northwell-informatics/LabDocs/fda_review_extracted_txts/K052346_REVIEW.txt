H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Penicillin at concentrations of 0.03 to 4 µg/mL for Staphylococci and 0.5 to 64
µg/mL for Enterococci on the MicroScan® Synergies plus ™ Gram-Positive
MIC/Combo Panel is intended for use with MicroScan® Synergies plus™ Panels
read on the WalkAway® -SI System (including upgraded WalkAway® -40 or
WalkAway® -96 to meet WalkAway® SI equivalence).
MicroScan® panels are designed for use in determining quantitative and/or
qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility and/or identification to the species
level of colonies, grown on solid media, of rapidly growing aerobic and
facultative anaerobic gram-positive cocci and Listeria.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The addition of penicillin at concentrations of 0.03 to 4 µg/mL for testing
Staphylococci and 0.5 to 64 µg/mL for testing Enterococci to the gram-positive
test panel at 4.5-16 hours or 16-20 hours for an overnight reading.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
• Turbidity method of inoculum preparation only.
• For prescription use only.
• S. saprophyticus will not be reported
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
Each panel contains two control wells: a negative control well, and a growth control
well (contains test medium without antibiotic). Antibiotics are diluted in water,
buffer, or minute concentrations of broth to selected concentrations prior to
dehydration of the panels. The panel is rehydrated and inoculated at the same time
with 0.1 ml of suspension prepared by the turbidity method (inoculum prepared in
0.4% saline with PLURONIC®, then 0.1ml transferred to 25ml of inoculum
Synergies plus Pos Broth with PLURONIC®) for a final inoculum concentration of
3-7 X 105 CFU/ml. Panels are incubated in a Walk-Away® System and read
periodically starting at 4.5 hours until sufficient growth to determine the MIC.
Alternately the panels may be incubated at 35o C in a non-CO for 16-24 hours and
2
read by visual observation of growth.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) M7 (M100-S15) “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
The WalkAway® SI uses a Colorimetric Optics System consisting of a color
wheel/lamp assembly and a Photosensor. There is an initial read at 2.5 hours with a
possible final read at 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 8, 12, 16, or 18 hours (overnight instrument
readings, manual readings) depending on the growth rate of the organism being
tested. The time of final read is dependent on the growth rate of the organism and
the sensitivity of the automatic reader since cell densities below 2 x 107 cells/ml are
not detected.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 20 isolates tested at 3 sites on 3
separate days in triplicate. The study included the testing on the WalkAway®
SI read at <16 hours, WalkAway® 16-18 hour readings and manual readings
at 16-20 hours incubation. The WalkAway® SI had 3 results that were not
readable at ≥16 hours. All results were >95% reproducible.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC isolates, E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and S. aureus ATCC
29213 were tested a sufficient number of times with acceptable results on all
testing days with the reference method. The reference and the three different
read methods had the same mode with E. faecalis ATCC 29212. However,
the mode of the reference method was different from the 3 different read
methods with the S. aureus ATCC 29213 but still within essential agreement
therefore this QC is acceptable. The main purpose of the S. aureus ATCC
29213 QC organism is to demonstrate that it is a penicillinase producer with
an expected range of ≥0.25. E. faecalis 29212 appears to be a better indicator
of the activity of penicillin.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical testing was conducted at 3 sites using fresh isolates supplemented
with stock isolates. A total of 534 gram-positive isolates were tested of which
469 were fresh isolates and 65 were stock isolates. There were 138 challenge
isolates tested at one site and compared to the reference broth dilution result
mode that was determined by previous testing of each isolate multiple times in
the recommended reference panel. The Synergies plus™ readings were
obtained at times between 4.5 and 16 hours of incubation for > 99% of the
results. An additional comparison was done with readings on the instrument
after overnight incubation and also read manually when incubated 16- 18

hours. Performance by these alternate reading methods was also acceptable
with no apparent differences or trends. The recommended CLSI reference
method was followed with the exception of the use of a small amount (0.1%)
PLURONIC® in the final inoculum. A validation of the use of PLURONIC®
in the frozen reference panels was conducted. Similar calculations for the
different reading methods were performed with very little difference. The test
device had a no growth rate of <10%.
The charts below demonstrated the performance of all three reading methods
(Synergies plus™ readings at <16 hours, overnight on the WalkAway® and
manually read at 18 hours using the touchScan®-SR) when compared to the
reference method.

NA – No intermediate range therefore no minor errors possible
Evaluable results are those that fall within the test range of the reference
method and could also be on-scale with the new device if within the
plus/minus one dilution variability. EA is when there is agreement
between the reference method and the MicroScan® within plus or minus
one serial two-fold dilution of antibiotic. CA is when the interpretation of
the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the
MicroScan® result.
