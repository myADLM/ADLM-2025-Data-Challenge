CLSI (NCCLS) EP5-A, EP6-A, EP7-A, EP17-A.
L. Test Principle:
Chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) referred as Chemiflex. It is a two
step assay. In the first step sample and assay diluent (MES buffer) and TPO coated
paramagnetic particles are mixed and incubated. Anti-TPO in the sample binds to the
microparticles. After a wash step anti-human acridinium labeled conjugate is added in the
second step. Following an incubation and wash cycle pre-trigger and trigger solutions are
added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as
relative light units(RLU). A direct relationship exists between the amount of anti-TPO in the
sample and the RLUs detected by the Architect i system optics.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed using Positive Control and 3 human panels (serum
pools with low, medium and high concentrations), 3 lots of reagents in replicates of
two at 2 separate times per day for 20 days on 3 instruments (according to CLSI
EP5-A).
ARCHITECT Anti-TPO assay is designed to have an assay precision of ≤ 10% total
CV for samples ≥ 5.61 IU/mL. Each reagent lot used a single calibration curve
throughout the study. Data from this study are summarized in the following table.*

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The assay was shown to be linear from 3.0 to 1000.0 IU/mL by the following study:
three high sample pools (1000, 300, and 30 IU/mL) were combined with a low pool
calibrator A to provide 9 test points. All test points were analyzed in replicates of 5
using a single reagent lot. Automated dilution was compared to a manual 1:2 dilution
using 9 human specimens with anti-TPO levels that were greater than calibrator E
(250 IU/mL). The manual dilution was done with Anti-TPO calibrator A. Summary
of results is shown in the following table.

hook effect was observed.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The anti-TPO reference calibrator is traceable to the NIBSC 66/387 reference
preparation. The anti-TPO reference calibrators are produced from the NIBSC 66/387
reference preparation with individual levels at 30.0, 15.0, 5.0, 1.5, 0.75, and 0.0
IU/mL. The proper weight fractions of the stock concentrate and calibrator diluent
were mixed to form the individual levels anti-TPO master calibrator at 0.00, 5.0, 20.0,
62.5, 250.0, and 1000.0 IU/mL. The calibrators and controls are manufactured from
human anti-TPO positive plasma pools.
Stability – Stability was established based on accelerated and real time studies on
three lots of Calibrators at various temperatures (5, 25, 30, 35, -20 and -50° C).
Stability test results and graphs are in the submission. The results indicate storage
stability for 12 months when stored at -10°C. On-board stability is 30 days. Stability
of reagents stored at 2-8° is shown as 9 months.
d. Limit of Blank:
Limit of Blank was tested using 10 replicates of calibrator A and 4 replicates of
calibrator B per run. The acceptance criterion was ≤ 1.0 IU/mL. 36 total runs were
made across 3 instruments ( i 2000) using 3 different reagent lots. The Limit of Blank
was calculated as mean of all calculations plus 2 SDs for type 1 error of 2.5 %. The
Limit of Blank is 0.159 IU/mL for all 3 lots.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference from elevated levels of bilirubin (20mg/dl), hemoglobin (1000 mg/dl)
triglycerides (1000mg/dl) and total protein 10g/dl) were tested. A study was
performed based on CLSI EP7-A. Specimens with anti-TPO levels between 45.07
and 361.64 IU/mL were used. Specimens were spiked between 133.44 and 568.78
IU/mL. The average interference observed ranged from -3.6% to + 3.7% (within
≤15% acceptable range).
f. Assay cut-off:
Values greater than 5.6 IU/mL are considered positive.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The performance of the Architect Anti-TPO was compared to AxSYM Anti-TPO
assay. A total of 500 specimens (236 samples from healthy individuals and 264
samples from patients with autoimmune thyroid disease- 125 Graves’ disease and 139
Hashimoto’s Disease) were evaluated. Specimens were tested in replicates of one
using the Architect Anti-TPO assay with three reagent lots. 446 samples were < 1000
IU/mL. The remaining 54 samples were not included in the correlation since their
anti-TPO concentrations were greater than the assay range (> 1000 IU/mL). Data
from this study are summarized in the following table.
