I. Device Description:
The Alcohol Tester (PB2000) is a self-contained unit with an inlet for breath
sampling near the top left of the unit. The two models are identical except for
packaging. Users are instructed to press and hold the single button on the side of
the unit for 5-15 seconds to power on the unit and warm up the sensor. There are
also three LEDs on the front of the device. The green or “Ready” LED lights
when the battery power is sufficient and the device is ready to take a reading. The
user provides a breath sample by exhaling into the inlet for 3 seconds. The green
LED will remain lit if the breath alcohol content (BAC) is less than 0.04%, the
yellow LED will light if the BAC is from 0.04 and 0.08%, and the red LED will
light if the BAC is greater than 0.08%. The unit is powered by two “AAA”
batteries which are installed into the battery compartment on the back of the
device.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
The sponsor states conformance to the following standards:
1. EN 55022: 1998, Information Technology Equipment - Radio Disturbance
Characteristics - Limits and Methods of Measurement-Includes Amendment
A1:2000
2. EN 61000-4-2: 1995+A1: 1998+A2: 2001, Electromagnetic compatibility
(EMC) - Part 4-2 : Testing and measurement techniques - Electrostatic
discharge immunity test
3. EN 61000-4-3: 1996+A1:1998+A2:2001, Electromagnetic Compatibility
(EMC) Part 4: Testing and Measurement Techniques Section 3: Radiated,
Radio-Frequency, Electromagnetic Field Immunity Test-IEC 1000-4-3
L. Test Principle:
The Alcohol Tester (PB2000) is designed to measure deep lung air to test for the
presence of alcohol in the blood. The relationship between alcohol concentration in
deep lung air and blood is established by Henry’s Law in a ratio of 1:2100. The tin
dioxide semiconductor gas sensor is sensitive to changes in conductivity due to the
presence of alcohol in the breath. This change in conductivity due to the alcohol can
be quantitated and converted to % concentration of alcohol.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The Connectables’ device was not eligible for testing by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration (Department of Transportation). In lieu of NHTSA
testing, the sponsor collected performance data to support a claim of substantial
equivalence for the device.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed precision and accuracy testing for three BACs using a
Breath Alcohol Sample Simulator (BASS), which provides an alcohol-in-air
test sample with known alcohol concentrations, flow rate, and air
composition.
The sponsor performed 20 tests at 0.02% BAC, 20 at 0.06% BAC, and 20 at
0.010% BAC. Summary results were as follows:

0.02% BAC 20 0 0
0.06% BAC 0 20 0
0.10% BAC 0 0 20
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Since this device reports a range and not an actual concentration, it is not
possible to evaluate linearity.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device is traceable to a commercially available certified alcohol reference
solution at a concentration of 0.06% BAC. This solution is used to calibrate
the devices when manufactured.
d. Detection limit:
The NHTSA guidelines do not specifically address the detection limit of
breath alcohol device but require testing at a % BAC of zero (blank reading)
to assess the possibility of false positives. The sponsor tested twenty “zero”
concentration samples using non-alcoholic human breath. No false positives
were produced using these samples.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor evaluated the possibility of cigarette smoke interference with the
device. An alcohol-free individual was asked to smoke approximately one
half of a cigarette. Within one minute after smoking, the subject took a breath
alcohol reading. The subject then smoked another inhalation and repeated the
test to produce a total of five trials. Overall, the study involved two
participants and two different cigarette brands for a total of 200
measurements. The Connectables device produced no false positives in this
experiment. Other potential interferents were not evaluated with this device.
f. Temperature
The sponsor assessed the effect of temperature at 10 and 40o C. Twenty
different devices were tested at each temperature. The concentrations chosen
for testing were 0.02, 0.06, and 0.10% BAC. According to the User’s Manual,
if the device has been inactive for more than 24 hours, the user should take
three readings and disregard the first two. Only the third reading should be
used. When this instruction was followed, the following results were
obtained:

10o C 0.06 0/20/0
10o C 0.10 0/0/20
g. Vibration/Drop Testing
The sponsor performed vibration testing per NHTSA specifications at
concentrations of 0.02, 0.06, and 0.10% BAC. Twenty separate devices were
used for each trial. Trial A involved vibrating the devices through a frequency
range of 10 to 30 Hz at an amplitude of 3.0 mm. Results were as follows:
Concentration (%BAC) Green/Yellow/Red
0.02 20/0/0
0.06 0/20/0
0.10 0/0/20
Trial B involved vibrating the devices through a frequency range of 30 to 60
Hz at an amplitude of 1.5 mm. Results were as follows:
Concentration (%BAC) Green/Yellow/Red
0.02 20/0/0
0.06 0/20/0
0.10 0/0/20
h. Assay cut-off:
The colored lights on the Breathalyzer (PB1000) and Alcohol Tester
(PB2000) are interpreted as follows:
No lights illuminated: Battery low
Green light illuminated: BAC is less than 0.04%
Yellow light illuminated: BAC is in the range of 0.04 to 0.08%
Red light illuminated: BAC is greater than 0.08%
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor conducted a consumer study comparing the Alcohol Tester
PB2000 to the predicate device. The purpose of the study was to determine if
consumers could correctly operate and interpret the device using only the
supplied User’s Manual, and to compare the results to the predicate device.
There were 27 paired comparisons, and the reported age range of the
volunteers was from 21 to 56 years of age. There were 18 men and 9 women
who participated in the trial. Each participant took their own breath alcohol

reading with the Alcohol Tester and recorded the result. Immediately
afterward, the participants provided another breath sample, which was
analyzed using the predicate device operated by a trained individual. The
breath alcohol concentrations ranged from a BAC of 0.00% to 0.35% by the
predicate device.
Based on the interpretation chart in the labeling, 21 out of 27 samples
produced a concentration range on the Alcohol Tester that included the
specific concentration measured by the predicate. For 5 samples the
Connectables device gave a concentration range lower than the predicate
device result. For 1 sample, the Connectables device gave a concentration
range higher than the predicate. The six discrepant results are presented in the
table below:
Predicate Device Connectables vs.

Yellow 0.09 Lower
Yellow 0.09 Lower
