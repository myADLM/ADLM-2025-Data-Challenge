GlucoPack™ Meter
I. Device Description:
GlucoPack™ Meter
Components
This glucose-meter is composed of a strip sensor analog circuit unit, step perception
unit, micro controller unit, and communication unit.
• Strip sensor analog circuit unit
Once the blood sample is injected into the strip sensor, the electricity is on;
voltage amplification is generated through the electric current-voltage
converter. The signal amplified is filtered and sent to AD input unit of MCU
and then digitalized.
• Step perception unit
When a person moves his or her body, the movement is captured and the
counter in MCU counts it.
• Micro controller unit
This unit digitalizes the signal which is an input from the analog signal
process circuit on the A/D input terminal, and counts the signal which is
transmitted through step perception unit and transfers that signal to external
display device.
• Communication unit
This unit communicates with an external display device and transmits data to
the display device.
• External display device
This unit displays data and test results transmitted from the communication
unit.
Features of product
• Type and extent of protection against the electric shock: internal power supply
system device, type B device
• Safety device: power protection circuit, which is applied for safe use of the
Lithium Polymer battery, has following functions;
o Over charge protect function: when the battery is overcharged by an
external charger due to defective performance, this function shuts off the
circuit and protects the device from overcharge.
o Over discharge protect function: this function protects the battery from

over discharge under the critical voltage.
o Over current shut off function: this function shuts off the over current flow
as a result of the internal/external abnormal condition.

L. Test Principle:
The principle of the test relies on glucose in the blood sample to react to the
electrodes in the test strip. The test strip employs an electrochemical signal
generating an electrical current that will stimulate a chemical reaction. This reaction
is measured by a glucose module integrated in the battery pack of the cell phone and
the results of the blood glucose are displayed on the cell phone.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-Run precision
The procedure was conducted by taking 4mL of blood that was treated with
EDTA through a vacuum tube. Glucose was added to the 4 mL of blood to
generate 5 different levels of glucose concentration for the test. Each of the
samples was measured 50 times.
Between-Run precision
Three different control solutions of Low, Normal and High were measured
twice a day, once in the morning (Run 1) and once in the afternoon (Run 2)
during a month’s time. For each Run, two measurement readings were taken
in which the mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient variation percent
(CV %) were calculated.
Mean (mg/dL) SD CV %

56.6 2.1 3.7
Between-run/Total
110.4 3.6 3.3
(control solution)
300.2 9.7 3.2
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Samples with equally spaced concentrations were evaluated. The linear range
is defined by the highest and lowest measured concentrations where the
response is linear.
The GlucoPack phone used in this test can display below 10 mg/dL over 600
mg/dL for checking linear range. The planed GlucoPack phone for sale
displays “Low” below 10 mg/dl, “Hi” over 600 mg/dL.
Each of the glucose levels were measured 5 times to test for precision.
In order to evaluate the straight line for the Sensory Strip that was used, the
following formula was used:
1st order polynomial, y = ax + b, 2nd order polynomial, y = aX2 + bX + c
In all dilution schemes, the applicant started with high and low concentration
samples in which the concentrations meet or exceed the range of interest. For

the test, the highest and lowest glucose concentration used was 611.8mg/dL
and 8.8mg/dL. If a strip sensor has an ideal linearity (r2=1) from lowest to
highest concentration, the ideal concentration of level 2 mixed with 0.875L
and 0.125H volume ratio is a 84mg/dL [(0.875*8.8 +
0.125*611.8)/(0.875+0.125)].

The polynomial evaluation of linearity assumes that the data set is not linear.
This approach assumes that the data points fall perfectly on a line or curve in
the absence of random error. The method consists of two parts. The first part
examines whether a nonlinear polynomial fits the data better than a linear one.
The second part assesses whether the difference between the best-fitting
nonlinear and linear polynomial is less than the amount of allowable bias for
the method, which should be predefined.
The nonlinear 2nd fits the data better than a linear one, but the difference is
lower than 1.8 mg/dL from 8.8 mg/dl to 611.8 mg/dL. The R2 of 1st order
regression is a 0.9997

d. Detection limit:
10 – 600 mg/dL (linearity study above)
e. Analytical specificity:
Approximately 2 mL of blood was taken from 64 random diabetic individuals.
The blood samples were treated with the EDTA vacuum tube and the glucose
concentration was adjusted to < 50 ~ < 580 mg/dL by adding an adequate
amount of the phosphate buffer (20mM with pH 7.4) that contains a different
level of glucose. In order to adjust the Hematocrit value (30 ~ 55%),
appropriate volumes of the centrifuged plasma was removed.

The Hematocrit level and glucose concentration in the blood was assessed by
using the YSI2300 STAT PLUS.
The sponsor’s acceptance criteria are that all the data should be within +/- 30

The % bias of the assay value of the GlucoPack system is relative to the YSI
and does not have a negative or positive correlation to hematocrit level in this
experiment. 99% of the data is within +/- 20% bias in the overall range of
glucose and hematocrit.
Interferences (see k043512):
• GlucoPack™ Test Strips are specific to D-glucose and do not react with
other sugars which may be present in the blood.
• GlucoPack™ Test Strips do not interfere with the hematocrit at a normal
range (30-55%) of blood glucose.
• Extreme levels in hematocrit may affect test results. Hematocrit levels
less than 30% may cause falsely high readings. Hematocrit levels
greater than 55% may cause falsely low readings.
• Blood samples that contain large amounts of ascorbic acid and uric acid
may cause a slightly higher result than the actual glucose level.
• High concentrations of bilirubin, gentistic acid and other reducing
substances in the blood may cause inaccurately high results.
• Lipemic samples; cholesterol up to 500mg/dL or triglycerides up to
3000 mg/dL do not significantly affect the results. Glucose values,
however, in specimens beyond these levels should be interpreted with
caution.
• Blood samples that contain a high concentration of dissolved oxygen
may lower the test result.
