4. Panel: 83
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s): aid in the identification of B. anthracis
2. Indication(s) for use:
The MIDI Sherlock Microbial Identification System for BioDef™ is intended to aid in the
identification of Bacillus anthracis through the analysis of membrane fatty acids derived from
cultured bacterial samples, using gas chromatography and pattern recognition software.
Warnings:
• The Sherlock BioDef system is not intended for use with spore preparations or materials
other than colonies from trypticase soy agar (with 5% defibrinated sheep blood) that have
been presumptively identified as Bacillus spp. BioDef cannot assess presence or absence of
virulence factors.
• Accurate identification of B. anthracis is dependent on purity of isolates, length of incubation
(24 h) at 35º C, and media type, along with well-trained and experienced technicians. Only

BBL™ 5% sheep blood agar has been validated for identifying B. anthracis with the MIDI
Sherlock Microbial Identification System for BioDef™.
• The definitive identification of B. anthracis from colony growth requires additional testing
and confirmation procedures in consultation with public health or other authorities to whom
reporting is required.
• Identification of organisms other than B. anthracis in the Sherlock BioDef’s system’s BTR
library database has not been evaluated.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription Use
4. Special instrument requirements: Gas chromatograph equipped with a 25 m capillary
column having dimensions of 0.2 mm internal diameter and 0.33 film thickness of 5% phenol
methyl siloxane as the liquid phase. Requires hydrogen as carrier gas and a flame ionization
detector using air and nitrogen. Oven temperature must increase linearly from 170 to 270°
during analysis and an autoinjector to inject 2μL.
I. Device Description:
MIDI Sherlock Microbial Identification System for BioDef™ is based on gas chromatorgraphy
(GC) with a 25 x 0.2 mm capillary column (0.33-film thickness of 5% diphenyl-95%-dimethyl
siloxane), an oven with 170-270°C increase range during analysis, an autoinjector, and MIDI
Sherlock Microbial Identification System software that includes the BTR library [installed on a
PC, HP or Dell, with 8 gb HD, 128 mb RAM, 450MHz, Pentium III or higher, CD ROM drive
and LAN interface (Lan card or GPIB card); GPIB communication, NT 4.0, SP 5 or higher, 2000
or XP]. H carrier gas and N makeup gas (both 99.999% pure) is needed along with industrial
2 2
grade air. B. cereus (ATCC 14579) is run as a control. Reagents must be prepared using ACS
NaOH and NaCl with HPLC grade methanol, hexane, and methyl-tert-butyl ether.
The BTR library is used with the standard clinical (CLIN) database. The program is written in
Microsoft Visual Basic vrs 6.0.
A calibration standard (made and sold by Microbial ID (a sister company to MIDI) is also
needed to perform the testing procedure. The standard is a mixture of fatty acids used to
characterize peaks based on retention time.
Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) composition of bacterial cell membranes are distinctive. For B.
anthracis, 13:0 ISO and 17:0 ANTEISO are unique and distinguishing from other Bacillus spp.
The BTR library contains approximately 150 Bacillus spp. and is used to match similarity of an
unknown to the library profiles. A Similarity Index (SI) is calculated that expresses the relative
distance of an unknown’s profile from the population mean for a particular species. The SI
reflects both distance and variance from the mean (4.69 standard deviations is maximum for a
4.0 SI).

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): NA
L. Test Principle:
Growth from 24 h 5% SBA is treated to saponify and methylate fatty acids, followed by
extraction into an organic solvent. Fatty acid methyl esters are characterized by gas
chromatography, using retention times to calculate ECLs (equivalent chain length) based on
comparison to a calibration standard containing a mixture of saturated fatty acids (9-20
carbons length). Software compares ECL values of straight chain and branched chain acids
to those of known isolates. Capillary columns are calibrated for variations and long-term
drift to center ECLs of polar hydroxy fatty acids with expected ECLs in the library.

Temperatures and gas pressures may be adjusted to calibrate drift. Samples must be prepared
from sufficient growth to allow detection of smaller fatty acid peaks. Contaminating peaks
can occur from a faulty injection port liner or septum. Testing is designed to be run on the
Agilent 6850 or 5890 gas chromatographic systems.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
B. anthracis and non-B. anthracis samples were tested at 11 different laboratories. The %
correct identifications overall in these labs for the B. anthracis samples was 96.3% and for
non-B. anthracis was 99.7%.

Samples B. anthracis@ B. anthracis@
Bacillus-anthracis 383 369 14 96.3%
Near Neighbors* 381 1 380 99.7%
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: NA
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrator standard is a mixture of fatty acid methy esters (n-hexane, normal hexane,
hexyl hydride).
d. Detection limit: NA, a sufficient amount of growth must be used (40 mg or one
heaping 4 mm loopful).
e. Analytical specificity: 169 samples of 8 non-anthracis Bacillus species most closely
similar phenotypically to B. anthracis were correctly separated
f. Assay cut-off: A BA similarity index must be >0.400 to correctly identify as B.
anthracis
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not done
b. Matrix comparison: NA
3. Clinical studies: NA – the MIDI test uses solid culture media growth and is dependent on
culture for recovery of growth from clinical specimens or other sample types. Evaluations
were performed with B. anthracis and near-neighbor isolates, some of which were obtained
originally from clinical specimens

a. Clinical Sensitivity:
b. Clinical specificity:
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The B. anthracis entry of the Sherlock BioDefTM library contains 116 analyses of 66 strains of
the pathogen and 169 analyses of 8 near neighbor Bacillus species. It was earlier determined
that only B. cereus, B. thuringiensis and B. mycoides are sufficiently close in FAME profile to
potentially give rise to problems of discrimination. The comparison species, and numbers of
strains and analyses are as follows.
B. cereus (38 analyses) B. megaterium (11 analyses)
B. circulans (37 analyses) B. mycoides (10 analyses)
B. coagulans (31 analyses) B. subtilis (16 analyses)
B. licheniformis (8 analyses) B. thuringiensis (18 analyses)
By comparison to more than 400 species entries in the clinical (Sherlock CLIN version 5.0)
library, no other species was likely to give FAME profiles similar to B. anthracis.

For 48 calibration standard determinations, the average SI was 0.998 with a range of
0.989-1.00. The manufacturer recommends a B. cereus and B. anthracis Sterne as
control organisms for adequate saponification and methylation of fatty acids, and also for
correct identification.
