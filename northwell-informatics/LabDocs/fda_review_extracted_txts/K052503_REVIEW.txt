L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA IMS® Troponin I Ultra (TnI-Ultra) assay is a heterogenous sandwich
immunoassay using magnetic separation. Reagent 1 (R1) contains a fluoresceinated
monoclonal antibody to troponin I and Reagent 2 (R2) contains a polyclonal antibody
to troponin I conjugated to the enzyme alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The sandwich
complex formed by the analyte and the antibody conjugates is captured by the
magnetic particles so that the troponin I concentration in the sample can be measured
in terms of enzyme activity. The enzyme substrate used for this assay is a dioxetane
phosphate derivative, which is dephosphorylated by ALP resulting in photon
emission. Luminescence is measured by a photomultiplier tube. The dose response
curve is proportional to the analyte concentration in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Imprecision was evaluated in a protocol similar to CLSI EP5-A. Studies were
performed over a 10-day period on two instruments with serum pools and
Bayer Cardiac Control materials. The protocol consisted of five replicates of
each control or pool and one run per day per system.
Samples N Mean Within Run Within Run Total SD Total CV
(ng/mL) SD CV (%) (%)
Control Level 1 50 1.55 0.02 1.2 0.09 5.7
Control Level 2 50 14.06 0.08 0.6 0.32 2.2
Control Level 3 50 32.93 0.53 1.6 0.90 2.7
Pool Level A 49 0.04 0.002 5.1 0.002 5.8
Pool Level B 49 0.21 0.01 2.9 0.01 5.4
Pool Level C 50 9.05 0.10 1.1 0.24 2.7
Pool Level D 50 38.69 0.59 1.5 0.94 2.4
To determine the functional sensitivity of the assay, a series of low serum
pools was prepared by sequential dilutions of a low sample with a negative
serum pool and run on two instruments over a ten day period. Recoveries for
the low serum pools from the two instruments were combined and the total
CV was calculated. The level for the 10% total CV was estimated to be 0.03
ng/mL. The upper 99th percentile of normal distribution was found to be 0.04
ng/mL for serum (n = 337).

The assay meets the guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology and
American College of Cardiology that the 99th percentile of a reference group
is used as the cutoff for increased troponin levels and that the assay should
have the imprecision (total CV) at the 99th percentile cutoff of 10% or less.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To determine the high dose hook effect, high levels of troponin I antigen were
spiked into negative serum pool. The reaction rates of the spiked samples
were obtained from the ADVIA IMS. There was no drop in rates for TnI
concentrations up to 1200 ng/mL.
Serum samples with high troponin I concentrations were mixed in various
proportions with serum samples containing low levels of troponin I with
expected concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 36.2 ng/mL. When compared to
the expected value, the measured (observed) values of troponin I averaged
103% with a range of 98.9 to 108.8%. Linearity was also evaluated by spiking
troponin I in the calibrator serum base. These pools were then mixed in
various proportions to prepare five levels with expected concentrations
ranging from 0.2 to 50 ng/mL and tested on two ADVIA IMS systems. When
compared to the expected value, the measured (observed) values averaged
100.5% with a range of 96 to 106%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ADVIA IMS® TnI-Ultra method is traceable to an internal standard
manufactured using purified material. Assigned values of the calibrators are
traceable to this standardization. The calibrator value is assigned through a
two step process. The Master Lot value is assigned via serum sample
correlation between the ADVIA IMS TnI and the ACS:180 TnI assays. The
assigned calibrator values are based on in-house and external clinical trial
correlation data. The future lots are value assigned through a nested testing
protocol.
Calibrators, after storage at the recommended storage condition are tested
through the recommended shelf life. Data from calibrators stored at stress
temperatures are utilized to ensure lot to lot consistency and provide
information for product stability during shipping. The ADVIA IMS® TnI-
Ultra Calibrator is stable at ≤ 20º C until the expiration date on the vial.
Thawed calibrators should be stored at 2-8ºC for up to 7 days. Aliquots can
be stored frozen for up to 30 days.
d. Detection limit:
The minimum detectable concentration (MDC) was determined by running 20
replicates of a serum pool from normal donors. The mean rate and standard
5

--- Page 6 ---
deviation from the normal serum pool were calculated. The concentrations
corresponding to mean rate +2 times S.D. was determined to be 0.01 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Potential cross reactants to troponin I were spiked into serum pools and tested
for cross-reactivity. Cardiac troponin T, troponin C and skeletal troponin I all
showed negligible cross-reactivity. Serum pools spiked with hemoglobin up
to 500 mg/dL, triglyceride up to 1000 mg/dL, bilirubin up to 20 mg/dL and
albumin up to 6500 mg/dL showed less than 5% interference.
f. Assay cut-off:

b. Matrix comparison:
Lithium heparin and serum sample pairs were assayed with the ADVIA IMS®
TnI-Ultra assay. The linear regression equation is: y (Heparinized plasma) =
0.8908 x (serum) + 0.2327; R = 0.993, n = 45, with values ranging from 0.03
to 19.4 ng/mL. The dose recoveries for the plasma samples were about 11%
lower than the corresponding serum samples. The labeling contains the
instructions that plasma samples showed an 11% reduction in dose compared
to serum samples and to not use heparinized plasma and serum samples from
the same patient interchangeable with this test.
