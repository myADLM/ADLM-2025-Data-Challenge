H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Spectral West Nile virus IgM STATus™ test is a rapid
immunochromatographic lateral flow assay that utilizes recombinant West Nile
virus (WNV) antigen (E glycoprotein) for the qualitative detection of IgM
antibodies to WNV in human serum or plasma (sodium heparin or sodium
citrate). This test is for the presumptive laboratory diagnosis of West Nile virus
infection in patients having signs and symptoms of meningoencephalitis. Positive
results must be confirmed by the PRNT (Plaque Neutralization Reduction Test),
or by using the current CDC guidelines for diagnosis of this disease.
2. Indication(s) for use:
See Intended Use above
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
This device is for prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:

I. Device Description:
The Spectral WNV IgM STATusTM test employs solid-phase
immunochromatographic assay technology to qualitatively detect the presence of
WNV IgM antibodies in serum or plasma. See Test Principle below for more details.

L. Test Principle:
The Spectral WNV IgM STATusTM test employs solid-phase
immunochromatographic assay technology to qualitatively detect the presence of
WNV IgM antibodies in serum or plasma. When the specimen to be tested is
dispensed into the sample well of the Spectral device, anti-WNV IgM in the sample
will bind to the recombinant WNV antigen (envelop glycoprotein (E) of West Nile
virus, NY99 strain) to form a tertiary complex with gold-labeled monoclonal murine
antibody against flavivirus family glycoprotein E. This tertiary complex will migrate
through reaction strip and be captured by goat anti-human IgM antibodies at the Test
area. Excess, unreacted gold complex detector is captured by immobilized anti-mouse
IgG antibodies at the Control area. Assay results are determined by visual assessment
of the presence or absence of control and test bands.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility studies were performed using 15 patient serum samples at 3
study sites over a three day period. Each day a new lot was used and a
different operator was employed. The 15 member reproducibility panel
consisted of 6 clinical specimens with a mean index value 25% above the
cutoff, 6 clinical specimens with a mean index value 15% below the cutoff,

Interfering Substances
The following constituents of human blood were tested to ensure that they did not
interfere with the performance of the Spectral device. The concentration of the serum
proteins or lipids shown in Table below were added to positive and negative serum
specimens and tested with the Spectral device. No interference up to the concentrations
listed below was observed.
Potential Interferents and Concentrations
Potential Interfering material Concentration
Human serum albumin 16 g/dL
Bilirubin (unconj.) 60 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 25 g/dL
Triglycerides 1.3 g/dL
Human IgM 300 mg/dL
IgM Specificity:
The IgM specificity of the Spectral WNV IgM test was assessed in 14 paired positive
samples by treating with 5mM dithiothreitol (DTT) solution for one hr at room
temperature (22-24°C). All 14 treated samples produced negative results following the
treatment with DTT and their respective untreated paired samples remained positive,
indicating the presence of IgM class antibodies in the positive samples (10).
Cross Reactivity:
Cross- reactivity studies with sera that were sero-positive to other potentially cross-
reactive pathogens were conducted at a Public Health Laboratory in the North Eastern
USA (site 1). Three out of seven Dengue post infection samples were tested at Public
Health Laboratory at Mid-West Canada (site 3); 29 out of 33 RF positive sera and 23 out

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Study sites 1-3: Negative agreement of Spectral device with comparator in non-
flavivirus IgM samples:
Studies were performed at three sites on clinical serum specimens collected prospectively
from patients with a variety of non-flavivirus ailments (rash, febrile, bronchitis, diarrhea,
drug, neuropathy, acute coronary syndrome etc) and from endemic normal populations
either at emergency departments of hospitals or at in-house collection. Site 1 represents
an endemic region at the South-Western State of America; sites 2 and 3 represent
endemic regions of South Eastern Provinces of Canada. These specimens were tested at
individual sites concomitantly with the Spectral and a commercially available comparator
device. The results are tabulated as “Pos” (positive), or “Neg” (negative). Indeterminate
results produced by the comparator device are listed as equivocal (“Eqv”)

Study Site 4: A provincial health laboratory located at South Eastern Province of Canada
assessed the performance of the Spectral device with randomized retrospective patient
serum specimens (n=90) that were sent to the laboratory with suspected WNV infection
based on clinical signs and symptoms. This batch of samples constituted 40 WNV PRNT
confirmed and 50 CDC WNV IgM ELISA negative specimens. All specimens were
randomized and tested blinded with the Spectral device.

Study Site 5:
Spectral device reactivity was assessed at a public health laboratory located in a prairie
Province at Central Canada using a banked panel of clinical serum specimens that were
drawn from patients (n=79) with clinical symptomlogy consistent with the West Nile
virus infection. These samples also included symptomatic acutely infected patients
(PRNT confirmed, n= 24) exhibiting either febrile illness or neuro-invasive disease such
as meningitis or encephalitis and, others specimens from asymptomatic patients (n=25)
that were sent to the laboratory to detect previous West Nile virus exposures. All these
samples were then randomized, blinded and tested with the Spectral device.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Serum specimens from a total of 346 presumably healthy individuals (n=67) or non-
WNV ailments (n=279) including 61 febrile patients were tested with the Spectral WNV
IgM STATusTM test (henceforth referred to as the Spectral device) in a general population
from endemic regions of USA and Canada. The samples were about equally distributed
between male (47.1%) and female (52.9%) populations. Positive results were observed
and determined to be positive due to heterophile antibodies interferences.
