Qualitative immunoassay
E. Applicant:
Tianjin New Bay Bioresearch Co., Ltd.
F. Proprietary and Established Names:
Forsure One Step Multiple (Up to Six) Drug Screen Test Card
G. Regulatory Information:
1. Regulation sections:
21 CFR 862.3100, 862.3610, 862.3250, 862.3640, 862.3870

4. Panel:
Toxicology (91)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Refer to Indications for use.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Forsure One Step Multiple (Up to Six) Drug Screen Test Card is a
prescription assay intended for professional use in central laboratories only. It
provides qualitative screening results for Amphetamine (AMP),
Methamphetamine (MET), Bezoylecgonine (BEG/COC), 11-nor-Δ-9-
Tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid (THC), Morphine (MOR/OPI) and
Phencyclidine (PCP) in human urine at cut off concentrations of AMP 1000
ng/ml, MET 1000 ng/ml, BEG 300 ng/ml, THC 50ng/ml, MOR 2000 ng/ml

and PCP 25ng/ml. The device may include as few as one and as many as six
individual assays. For In Vitro Diagnostic Use.
This assay provides only a preliminary result. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be applied to any drugs of abuse test result,
particularly in evaluating a preliminary positive. To obtain a confirmed
analytical result, a more specific alternate chemical method is needed. Gas
chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) is the recommended
confirmatory method.
3. Special condition for use statement(s):
This assay provides only a preliminary result. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be applied to any drugs of abuse test result,
particularly in evaluating a preliminary positive. To obtain a confirmed
analytical result, a more specific alternate chemical method is needed. Gas
chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) is the recommended
confirmatory method.
Certain foods or medications may interfere with tests for amphetamines and
opiates and cause false positive results.
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Not applicable. The device is a visually read single-use device.
I. Device Description:
The product is a single-use device in which one or two strips are inserted into a
cassette. Each of the strips contains reagents that test for one to three drugs; therefore
the device can test as few as one or as many as six drugs at a time. Operators add
several drops of the sample to the sample well. The test reaction is initiated by
movement of the sample through the test strip.
Description of the test antibodies: monoclonal mouse antibody against amphetamine,
methamphetamine, benzoylecgonine, morphine, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and
phencyclidine (PCP).
Description of the control line antibody: monoclonal goat anti-mouse
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Branan Medical Corporation Monitect Multiple Drug Screen
2. Predicate K number(s):
k004034
3. Comparison with predicate:
Both devices are for the qualitative determination of the same analyte(s) in the
same matrix, and utilize the same cutoff concentration. Both are visually-read
single use devices.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
The sponsor did not reference any standards in their submission.
L. Test Principle:
The test employs lateral flow immunochromatographic technology.
Drug in the sample and drug-labeled conjugate (containing a chromagen) compete for
antibody binding sites in the test area of the test strip. Binding of drug in the sample
causes the absence of a line at the test area, i.e., a positive result. When drug is not
present in the sample, the drug-labeled conjugate binds at the test line, resulting in
formation of a line, i.e., a negative result. The absence or presence of the line is
determined visually by the operator.
The device also has an internal process control which indicates that an adequate
volume of sample has been added and that the immunochromatographic strip is intact.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed a precision study in which they compared
results from a single-analyte device to the same assay as part of a
six-drug card. For example, single benzoylecgonine results were
compared to benzoylecgonine results when included as part of a six-

Sensitivity of this assay is characterized by validating performance
around the claimed cutoff concentration of the assay, including a
determination of the lowest concentration of drug that is capable of
producing a positive result. This information appears in the
precision section, above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking various concentrations of
similarly structured drug compounds into drug-free urine. By
analyzing various concentration of each compound the sponsor
determined the concentration of the drug that produced a response
approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay.

The following compounds were evaluated for potential positive and/or
negative interference with the assay. To evaluate for interference the
sponsor added potentially interfering compounds to drug-free urine (to test
for positive interference) and to urines at the cutoff concentration (to test
for negative interference). All potential interferents were added at a
concentration of 100 µg/mL. There were no deviations from the expected
results.

There is the possibility that other substances and/or factors not listed
above may interfere with the test and cause false results, e.g., technical or
procedural errors.
The following endogenous compounds were evaluated for potential
positive and/or negative interference with the assay. To evaluate for
interference the sponsor added potentially interfering compounds to drug-
free urine (to test for positive interference) and to urines at the cutoff
concentration plus 25% (to test for negative interference). There were no
deviations from the expected results.

f. Assay cut-off:
The identified cutoff concentrations of the assays are the cutoff
concentrations recommended for use by the Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the
claimed cutoff concentration appears in the precision section, above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Because the candidate device was compared to a reference method,
GC/MS, it was not compared to a predicate device.
Sample description: Unaltered clinical urine samples were evaluated.
Sample selection: Samples were purchased from a commercial
laboratory, which supplied the GC-MS concentration for all negative
and positive samples.
The studies included an adequate number of samples that contained
drugs near to the cutoff concentration of the assay. Approximately
10% of the study samples are evenly distributed between plus and
minus 50% of the claimed cutoff concentration.
Number of study sites: one
Type of study site(s): clinical setting
Operator description: clinical site staff
