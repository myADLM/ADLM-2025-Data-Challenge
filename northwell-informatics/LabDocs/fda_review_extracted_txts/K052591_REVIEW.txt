L. Test Principle:
CRP present in serum reacts with anti-human CRP (mouse) monoclonal antibody-coated
latex particles. The antigen-antibody reaction results in agglutination of the latex particles
and is detected as an absorbance change at 578 nm. The change in absorbance is
proportional to the concentration of CRP in the sample when compared to a standard curve
generated by the analysis of known CRP standards.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Serum pools were prepared and run in triplicate over 20 days to determine within
run and run-to run precision using CLSI/NCCLS EP5-A protocol
Within Run Run-to-Run
Sample N Mean 1 Std. Dev. %CV 1 Std. Dev. %CV

1 60 0.886 0.16 1.83 0.022 2.46
2 60 6.71 0.05 0.76 0.089 1.31
3 60 38.88 0.24 0.61 0.430 1.11
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The usable range of this reagent is from 0.1 to 400 mg/L. Samples that exceed 400
mg/L should be diluted with saline and the analysis repeated with correction of the
results for the dilution factor.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrator value assignment to IFCC CRM470 and stability testing is described.
Calibrators are of human source material, tested and found to be negative for
Hepatitis B surface antigens, anti-Hepatitis C virus antibodies, and anti-human
immunodeficiency virus antibodies with FDA approved assays.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of blank, limit of detection, and limit of quantitation was determined using
CLSI/NCCLS EP-174. The limit of quantitation was 0.024 mg/L. The limit of
blank and limit of detection were found to be 0.015 and 0.030 mg/L, respectively.
e. Analytical specificity:
Serum pools spiked with Bilirubin up to 50 mg/dL, hemoglobin up to 1000 mg/dL,
lipid up to 2000 formazin turbidity units, ascorbic acid up to 100 mg/dL, and
rheumatoid factor up to 500 IU/mL do not change from the unspiked serum by
more than 3%. No hook effect was observed with concentrations up to 500 mg/L.
Human anti-mouse antibody testing (HAMA) was not performed.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Wide Range Correlation
Comparison of 98 serum samples analyzed using the Nanopia CRP on the Hitachi
917 with a commercially available assay using least squares regression analysis.
These studies showed a full range (0 – 320 mg/L) correlation coefficient (R2) of
0.9992 with a regression equation y = 1.015x – 0.035 where x was the predicate
method and y was the Nanopia CRP.

Low Range Correlation
Additional correlation with patient samples with CRP concentrations below 10
mg/L was compiled from 71 paired samples. At this low range recovery of the
Nanopia CRP compared to the predicate demonstrated a correlation coefficient (R2)
of 0.9981 and a regression equation of y = 1.015x – 0.14 where x was the predicate
method and y was the Nanopia CRP.
