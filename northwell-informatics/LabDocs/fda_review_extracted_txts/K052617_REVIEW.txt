L. Test Principle:
The GBF Ferritin LIT assay is a latex particle enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay
to quantify ferritin in human serum. When ferritin in the sample is mixed with the
latex microparticles sensitized with duck anti-ferritin IgY (ΔFc), agglutination among
the latex microparticles occurs based on the antigen-antibody reaction. The
agglutination increases the turbidity of the sample and the degree of agglutination is
detected by the absorbance change at 570 nm. The value of the absorbance change is
proportional to the ferritin concentration of the sample and is recorded by a general
chemistry autoanalyzer. Then, the actual ferritin concentration of the sample is
determined by interpolation of the calibration curve obtained by standard samples
with known ferritin concentrations.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Total Precision and Within-run Precision:
A precision study was performed on a Hitachi 717 using GBT kit. Test
samples with the following ranges (Level I: 300-350 ng/mL, Level II: 50-60
ng/mL and Level III: 15-30 ng/mL) were prepared by pooling different patient
samples.
Total precision performance was assayed in all 3 pools in duplicates twice a
day for 10 different days (n=60). The acceptance criterion for precision was
CV: ≤10%. The results are summarized in the table below.
# Days Mean(ng/mL) SD CV (%)
10 328.6 2.98 0.91
10 58.2 3.19 5.48
10 23 1.73 7.53
Within-run precision performance was measured 15 times on the 3 level
pools. The acceptance criterion for precision was CV: ≤10%. The results are
summarized in the table below.
# Tests= 15 Sample I Sample II Sample III
Mean (ng/ml) 333.5 54.9 19.9
S.D. 3.78 2.49 1.75
CV (%) 1.13 4.54 8.79
Max (ng/mL) 339 59 22
Min (ng/mL) 325 50 16
Additional precision testing was performed at the low end of the assay range
using a pooled serum sample. The mean was 10.8 ng/mL, with a within-run %
CV of 17.89% and a total % CV of 12.3 %. The within run, between run and

10	23	1.73	7.53

[Table 2 on page 3]
# Tests= 15	Sample I	Sample II	Sample III
Mean (ng/ml)	333.5	54.9	19.9
S.D.	3.78	2.49	1.75
CV (%)	1.13	4.54	8.79
Max (ng/mL)	339	59	22
Min (ng/mL)	325	50	16

total % CV were calculated according to NCCLS protocol.
Inter-lot variability:
The consistency and reproducibility between 5 production lots was tested with
three pools of patient samples with different ferritin concentrations (Low: 125
ng/mL, Medium: 500 ng/mL and High: 1000 ng/mL) were serially diluted
(dilution fold of 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1). All results fall within the
acceptance criterion of R2 >0.99.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was performed by diluting six high ferritin patient samples with
ferritin concentration of about 1000 ng/mL using normal saline as diluent
(dilution folds of 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1) to cover the assay range. GBC
Ferritin LIT Assay was linear from 0 to 1000 ng/mL with a slope=1053.1,
intercept = -29.56 ng/mL and R2 value = 0.9979.
The analytical range of Ferritin LIT Assay is 5-1000 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Ferritin Calibrator Set is standardized to the WHO Third International
Standard 94/572.
Stability studies were performed and the shelf-life of the reagents was found
to be stable for six months at 2-10oC.
d. Detection limit:
The definition of the detection limit is the lowest value differentiated from
zero. The concentration corresponding to a signal 2 SD above the mean for
zero ferritin calibrator is 5 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Interference
Interference is defined as when recovery is more than ±10% of the initial
value measured. No significant interference was found up to 60 mg/dL
bilirubin C and bilirubin F. In addition, no significant hemolysis was
found up to 500 mg/dL hemoglobin and for lipemia (chyle), no significant
interference was present up to 2940 turbidity.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not provided
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The assay was compared to the predicate on a study conducted on 50 serum
patient samples collected from hospital. By linear regression: (GBC Ferritin
LIT) = 1.072 (quantex Ferritin) – 17.729 ng/mL. R2=0.9808.
Instrument-instrument comparison:
A correlation study was performed using 50 patient samples with Ferritin
values covering the assay measuring range (5-1000 ng/mL) with
representative analyzers from the Beckman CX and Hitachi analyzer families
namely, Beckman CX5 and Hitachi 7150. The results are represented in the
chart below.
