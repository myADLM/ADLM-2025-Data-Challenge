L. Test Principle:
The DRG Salivary Testosterone ELISA Kit is based on the competition principle and the
microplate separation. An unknown amount of free testosterone present in the sample and a
fixed amount of testosterone conjugated with horseradish peroxidase compete for the binding
sites of mouse monoclonal testosterone antiserum coated onto the wells. After one-hour
incubation the microplate is washed to stop the competition reaction. After addition of the
substrate solution the concentration of testosterone is inversely proportional to the optical
density measured.

The upper end detectability of SLV testosterone is 4410 pg/mL. These results demonstrate that the test
system is performing equivalent to original.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The standards prepared for the SLV Testosterone kits are buffer based (artificial
saliva matrix). The range of calibrators were prepared by appropriate dilution from
the maximum standard (Smax: 5000 pg/mL). The testosterone for the standards is
purchased from a commercially available source, and is weighed in to make the 5000
pg/mL.
The reference values (calibrators/controls) were established using (Gas
chromatography-mass spectrophotometry) GC-MS methods, as per the guidelines for
quality assurance in medical laboratories, Instand E.V. Germany (L.D. Dikkesche. Et
al. 1988: De toepassing kwaliteitcontroleprogramma’s voor progesterone-, cortisol-,
testosterone- en oestradiolbe[alingen in serums. Tijdschr NVKC 13: 148-155).
WHO standard is not available.
The functional quality of the kit lots were tested using the Lyphochek controls from
BioRad, but controls are not included in the kit. These controls are commercially
available and can be purchased by the customers.
Real time stability, Accelerated stability, and Saliva sample stability were validated
for this assay.

The analytical sensitivity of SLV Testosterone ELISA was calculated from the mean
minus 2SD of 20 replicate analyses of the zero standard.

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity was tested with the following compounds whose chemical structure
could potentially cause interference with the SLV Testosterone ELISA. The
specificity of the antiserum used for the ELISA was evaluated by determination of the
cross-reactivity at 50% displacement of various compounds listed in the table below.
The cross-reactivity is defined as:
Concentration of testosterone at 50% B/BO x 100
Concentration of cross-reactant giving 50% B/BO
Steroid % Cross reaction
