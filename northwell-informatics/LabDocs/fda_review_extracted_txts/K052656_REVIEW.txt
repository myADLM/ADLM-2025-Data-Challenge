Qualitative growth based detection algorithm using optics light detection
E. Applicant:
bioMerieux, Inc.
F. Proprietary and Established Names:
VITEK® 2 Gram Positive Daptomycin
G. Regulatory Information:
1. Regulation section:
866.1645 Short-Term Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test System
2. Classification:
II
3. Product Code:
LON System, Test, Automated, Antimicrobial Susceptibility, Short Incubation
4. Panel:
83 Microbiology
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The VITEK®2 Gram Positive Daptomycin at concentrations of 0.5, 2, 4, and
8ug/mL is intended for use with the VITEK 2 System in clinical laboratories as
an in vitro test to determine the susceptibility of Enterococcus faecalis,
Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus epidermidis
and Staphylococcus haemolyticus to antimicrobial agents when used as
instructed in the Online Product Information.
The VITEK® 2 Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) is intended to be used
with the VITEK® 2 System for the automated quantitative or qualitative
susceptibility testing of isolated colonies for the most clinically significant
aerobic gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp.,
Streptococcus agalactiae, and S. pneumoniae.
2. Indication(s) for use:
This submission is for the addition of the antimicrobial agent Daptomycin at
concentrations at 0.5, 2, 4, and 8ug/mL with a calling range of <0.25- >4ug/mL

to the VITEK®2 gram positive susceptibility (GPS) CARD for the testing of
appropriate gram positive isolates.
3. Special condition for use statement(s):
Prescription Use only.
The current absence of data on resistant strains precludes defining any results
other than “Susceptible”. Strains yielding MIC results suggestive of a “non-
susceptible” category should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further
testing.
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Not applicable
I. Device Description:
Each VITEK® 2 GPS test card contains 45 microwells. A control well, that contains
only microbiological culture medium is resident on all cards, with the remaining
wells containing premeasured amounts of a specific antimicrobial agent combined
with microbiological culture media. A suspension of organism is made in 0.45-0.5%
sterile saline from a pure culture and standardized to a McFarland 0.5 standard using
the Vitek Colorimeter. The desired card (s) are placed in the cassette along with an
empty tube for the susceptibility card. The cassette is placed into the VITEK® 2
instrument where a susceptibility test will be automatically diluted from the ID
suspension by the VITEK® 2. The cards are then automatically vacuum filled; the
tubes are cut and the cards sealed prior to proceeding to the incubator/reader for
incubation (35.5o C) and optical scanning during the 6-15 hour incubation cycle.
Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) readings are performed every 15 minutes.
There is also an alternate manual dilution method of the organism that is
recommended in the package insert.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute) M7 (M100-S15) “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
VITEK GPS Daptomycin contains aliquots of microbiological culture media that
contain the equivalent of individually weighed, premeasured portions of Daptomycin.
A suspension of the isolate to be tested is diluted with 0.45-0.5% sterile saline. The
VITEK Card is inoculated with the diluted suspension using a vacuum filling process
in the VITEK Filling Module. The VITEK® System determines when a well
demonstrates growth (positive) based on the attenuation of light measured by an
optical scanner. Organism growth is expressed as increased turbidity in the wells.
Optical measurements are taken on an hourly basis. If during the 6-15 hour
incubation cycle, bacterial growth occurs at levels equal to or greater than a
predetermined threshold, regression analysis is utilized, along with the organism’s
identification, to determine the appropriate MIC value for the antimicrobial. The MIC
result must be linked to organism identification in order to determine an MIC value.
An MIC value along with a category interpretation will be reported.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Ten on-scale gram positive organisms were tested in triplicate at
each of three sites for three days for an overall inter and intra
reproducibility of >95%. This testing was performed using the
manual dilution method of the inoculum.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
Quality Control was performed during the studies using the manual
method of diluting the organisms. The two recommended QC
organisms were tested with the following results.

Inoculum density control: Internal verification of inoculum density
was performed on each of the first five days of testing and then
weekly for the duration of the study using 3 ATCC organisms and
five instruments with 50 results available for each organism. The
clinical sites also calibrated the colorimeter used at that site. All
recorded calibrated values were within acceptable parameters.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A comparison of the clinical data was performed to the broth
microdilution reference method as described in the CLSI M7.
Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus
agalactiae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus
haemolyticus were tested at three sites that included both clinical
and challenge isolates. All of the test organisms that provided
results did so in <16 hours. Results of testing performed using the
manual dilution feature are presented in the table below:

Since the Staphylococcus and Beta Streptococcus have a different

EA- essential agreement NS-non-susceptible
CA-Category Agreement maj-major error
min-minor error vmj-very major error
CA is when the interpretation of the VITEK ® 2 results agrees
exactly with the interpretation of the reference method. EA was
not established at the time of testing because a minimum of five
discrete dilutions is necessary to perform essential agreement (EA)
based on +/- one two fold dilution. The CA was acceptable for a
break-point [sensitive-intermediate-resistant (SIR)] categorization
as described in the FDA guidance document, “Class II Special
Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”.
The challenge set of organisms was also tested at one site using the
manual method of inoculation with the following performance:
Manual testing:

Enterococcus spp. < 4 (S)
The expected value range, interpretive criteria and QC are the same as
recommended in CLSI and FDA.
The current absence of data on resistant strains precludes defining any results
other than “Susceptible”. Strains yielding MIC results suggestive of a “non-
susceptible” category should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further
testing.
N. Proposed Labeling
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirement of 21 CFR Part 809.10
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
