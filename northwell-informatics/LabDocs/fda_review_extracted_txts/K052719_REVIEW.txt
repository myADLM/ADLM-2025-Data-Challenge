I. Device Description:
URITEST 10 Urinalysis Reagent Strips provide qualitative and semi-quantitative for
pH, specific gravity, ketones, blood, protein, nitrite, leukocytes, glucose, bilirubin,
and urobilinogen in urine. URITEST 10 Urinalysis Reagent Strips are firm plastic,
dry reagent strips. The reagent areas are dipped into the urine sample and read
visually according to a color chart or are read instrumentally with a Bayer® Family of
Clinitek Urine Analyzers. The results are available within 120 seconds. To obtain
optimal results, it is necessary to use fresh, well-mixed and uncentrifuged urine.

L. Test Principle:
The device is composed of multiple chemically reactive spots separate from each
other on a plastic strip. Read-out is accomplished by visually matching the position
and color of an exposed spot to a color coded chart provided with the device.
For the detection of urobilinogen, the device employs a modified Ehrlich’s reaction.
Urobilinogen reacts with Ehrlich’s reagent to form a red-colored compound. Color
changes from light orange-pink to dark pink.
For the detection of glucose, the device employs glucose oxidase to catalyze the
oxidation of glucose to form hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide thus formed
then oxidizes a chromogen on the reaction pad by the action of peroxidase.
For the detection of bilirubin, bilirubin reacts with a dichlorobenzene diazonium salt
in acid media to produce a colored product vie an azo coupling. Bilirubin
concentration is proportional to the intensity or the resulting purple color.
The device uses Legal’s test-nitroprusside reaction for the detection of ketones.
Acetoacetic acid in an alkaline medium reacts with nitroferricyanide to produce a
color change from beige to purple
The device uses a correlation between the concentration of ionic species and the
sample’s specific gravity to report an estimated specific gravity. Electrolyte (M+ X-)
in the form of salt in urine reacts with poly-methyl vinyl ether and maleic acid which
is a weak acid ionic exchanger. The reaction produces hydrogen ions which react with
a pH indicator that causes a color change.
To detect blood, the device exploits the pseudo-peroxidase activity of the haem
moiety of hemoglobin and myoglobin. A chromogen is oxidized by a hydroperoxide
in the presence of haem and produces a green color.
To qualitatively estimate protein concentration, the device uses the “error of
indicators” principle. Proteins interact with an ionizable electrolyte driving the release
of protons which in turn interact with a spectator indicator. The color change in the
indicator is correlated with the protein concentration.
The device detects nitrite through a reaction with an aromatic amino sulphanilamide
4

--- Page 5 ---
to form a diazonium compound. The diazonium compound reacting with tetrahydro
benzo(h)quinolin-3-phenol causes the color change.
One location on the strip contains an indoxyl ester and diazonium salt. Leukocytes
contain an esterase that hydrolyzes the indoxyl ester. The liberated compound reacts
with the diazonium salt on the strip to generate a purple compound. The concentration
of leukocytes is correlated with the production of a purple color.
The device used two indicators to measure pH in a broad range of urinary pHs.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The company demonstrated the precision of their device using 2 levels of
commercial urine control. The company referenced CLSI EP10-A2
“Preliminary Evaluation of Quantitative Clinical Laboratory Methods” in
determining the precision of their device. The company made 10
measurements per concentration level two times a day for 10 days for each of
3 lots of strips. Strips were read using a Clinitek 100 Urine Analyzer.
For the Level I material, the company found:

The company did find that high levels of ketones ( > 10 mg/dL ) and ascorbic acid
(>8.8 mg/dL ) would interfere with the measurements of glucose in urine using
this device. The company noted this interference in their product literature.
The company also noted that ascorbic acid at concentrations of 8.8 mg/dL or
higher interfered with the device’s detection of blood. The company noted this
interference in their product literature.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable in this submission.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The company substantiated their claim for equivalence by direct comparison
using clinical samples in four hospitals. The company compared the
performance of their device to their predicate using visual comparison and on 4
different models of Clinitek analyzers. Each sample was measured in duplicate
for a total of 10 measurements across the 5 platforms, i.e. visual reading by eight
users and 4 analyzers, for a total of 1514 measurements. The company made
measurements over 3 different manufacturing lots of the proposed device.
For glucose, the company determined:
