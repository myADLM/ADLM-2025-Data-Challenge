b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
According to the sponsor the evaluation of analytical performance of the Liberty
blood glucose monitoring system consists of several parts and the evaluation of the
linearity of readings is one of these parts. The method to assess the accuracy of
measurements on blood samples with a wide range of standard properties is defined
in the Liberty Linearity Evaluation Protocol. Included in this testing protocol are
descriptions of how the results it generates are to be assessed.
High and Low samples were prepared to glucose concentrations slightly higher than
that desired before being placed in the tonometer. The prepared samples had dropped
to near the desired values by the time they had equilibrated, and were mixed to
generate the desired range of linearity samples. There were six data points collected
for every sample prepared. The data, presented below shows neither extreme non-
linearity nor outliers.
Linearity data plotted as test method (y-axis) against sample glucose (x-axis). Linear- and 3rd-order
polynomial -least-squares regression curves are fitted to the data (solid and dotted lines respectively): see
below. The data is shown as individual points (crosses) with error bars marking the standard error limits of the
mean.

Difference plot
The difference between the meter reading and the sample glucose concentration is subject
to system accuracy limits within the Test Range of the meter. The system accuracy is
assessed according to the Liberty Product Requirements Document (PRD) the section of
the PRD relevant to this work is listed in the table below. This section defines
performance requirements according to ISO requirements:

Parameters determined for use in the t-test are listed in the above table and show that both
the second- and third-order polynomials have significant coefficients of non-linearity and
are therefore candidates for description of system performance. Of these two
polynomials, the standard error of regression shows the third-order polynomial to be the
better candidate. The difference between the linear (first-order) and third-order
polynomial are calculated in the table below for all sample concentrations encountered:

0.99 17.8 10.5 15. 8 5.2
The differences between the linear and non-linear models, when judged against the
criteria set for system accuracy, show deviations to be small. The final step defined in
NCCLS EP6-A to establish linearity is to check the repeatability for these measurements.
Repeatability is expressed in absolute terms for concentrations below 75 mg/dL and
relative terms above, in line with the system accuracy requirements defined in ISO
15197, which require less than 15 mg/dL error below this point and less than 20% error
above it.

Summary of linearity
For measurement of plasma glucose concentrations in whole blood by the AgaMatrix
Liberty Blood Glucose Monitoring System the method has been demonstrated to be linear
from 20 mg/dL (1.1 mM) to 600 mg/dL (33.3 mM), within the accuracy limits of 4.5%
above 75 mg/dL (4.2 mM) and 6 mg/dL (0.83 mM) below this point.
Summary of system accuracy
The results for system accuracy for glucose concentrations between 20 and 75mg/dL are
tabulated below:
Within + 5mg/dL Within + 10mg/dL Within + 15mg/dL
2/6 (33 %) 6/6 (100%) 6/6 (100%)
And the results for system accuracy for glucose concentrations between 75 and 600
mg/dL are:
Readings
Within + 5% Within + 10% Within + 15% Within + 20%
6/48 (13%) 19/48 (40%) 43/48 (90%) 48/48 (100%)
Combining these results gives 100% of data within the required limits (within ± 15
mg/dL of the results of the manufacturer’s measurement procedure at glucose
concentrations < 75 mg/dL and within ± 20 % at glucose concentrations < 75 mg/dL).
Success of the assessment
The plasma glucose concentration requirement, that the meter and test strip shall be able
to test blood glucose levels between 20-600 mg/dL (1.1 – 33.3 mmol/L), has been
satisfied.
The requirement for system accuracy defined in section 6.2.3 of the PRD and section 7.4
of ISO15197:2003 are met because 100% of data recorded as part of the protocol falls
within the required limits.
Linearity has been demonstrated according to the method defined in NCCLS EP6-A
Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical
Approach; Approved Guidelines.

The traceability of the AgaMatrix Liberty Blood Glucose Monitoring System is
referenced to the YSI 2300 Stat Plus glucose analyzer. The YSI 2300 glucose
reference method was used by AgaMatrix to calibrate the Liberty system to yield
plasma equivalent glucose concentrations when measuring capillary whole blood
samples. The YSI 2300 is also the reference method used in this study to assess the
accuracy with which glucose results are obtained using the Liberty system.
The glucose standard is referenced to the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Material (SRM) 917A, NIST-certified
volumetric glassware, and balances calibrated with NIST traceable mass standards.
Additional traceability of the Liberty Blood Glucose Monitoring System to the
primary reference method for plasma glucose is accomplished by periodic analysis at
AgaMatrix of NIST SRM 965a serum glucose controls (4 levels) which contain
NIST-certified isotope dilution mass spectrometry target values. Data available at
AgaMatrix demonstrate a high level of agreement between the methods. The
precision of the YSI 2300 analyzer observed suring analyses of SRM 965a is
typically between 0.5 to 2.0% CV at all levels of glucose tested.
d. Detection limit:
According to the sponsor High and Low blood samples were prepared to glucose
concentrations slightly higher than that desired before being placed in the tonometer.
The prepared samples had dropped to near the desired values by the time they had
equilibrated, and were mixed to generate the desired range of (20 – 600 mg/dL).
Readings were taken on the Low sample first because it was already just beyond the
limit of the meter’s test range. However, when measuring the Low sample, the screen
readings all displayed “LO”, indicating values below 20 mg/dL, and values had to be
recorded electronically off the meter. YSI measurements of the final sample
properties confirmed the samples had values below the test range of the meter. The
sponsor prepare a ninth sample by mixing aliquots from the Low and High blood
sample, and reading were obtained as listed in the table below.

The ascorbic acid interference requirement is not satisfied.
* Based on the results of the ascorbic acid interference test, the results indicate
that the maximum level of ascorbic acid interference that may be tolerated to
result in at most 10% bias is 2.0 mg/dL at a glucose level of 85 mg/dL. The
recommendation based on this test is to change the Product Requirement
Document (PRD) to reflect that the maximum level of ascorbic acid interference
that should be claimed is 2.0 mg/dL.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
According to the sponsor the lay user blood glucose results obtained with the Liberty
System were compared to the Health Care Provider (HCP) results obtained with the
Liberty System and linear regression analysis was performed. The number of data
points (n), the slope and its 95% confidence interval (95%CI), the y-intercept and its
95% confidence interval, the standard error of the estimate (Sy.x), and the correlation
coefficient (r) are summarized for all three sites in the table below.
In a similar manner, the lay user blood glucose results obtained with the Liberty
System were compared to the YSI reference method results, and the HCP results
obtained with the Liberty System were also compared to the YSI reference results.
Linear regression analyses were performed and the results for both comparisons at
each of the three sites. The table below was expanded to include range of x-value
(YSI) and range of y-values (Liberty) for all method comparisons. All the

b. Matrix comparison:
Liberty Glucose from Palm by User vs. Liberty Glucose from Fingertip by HCP
Alternate site comparisons studies obtained by the lay users on blood samples taken
from the palm of the hand were compared to glucose results obtained by Health Care
Provider (HCP) on blood samples taken from the fingertip. It was found that 98% of
the results obtained by users on blood samples taken from the palm of their hands
(51/52*) were within the clinically accurate zone A on consensus error grid analysis
when compared to the results obtained by (HCP) on blood taken from the fingertip.
The remaining result fell into the clinically acceptable zone B.
Linear regression analysis was performed and the linear regression equation and 95%
confidence interval for the slope and y-intercept for this Liberty user palm vs. Liberty
HCP fingertip comparison data are:
y = 0.98x (0.92 to 1.03) + 6.8 (-2.4 to 16.1), with Sy.x = 14.7 and r = 0.982.
There was a between method outlier detected in this data set according to NCCLS
EP9-A2: for the sample of ID# 14 the user palm and HCP finger results were 194
mg/dL and 293 mg/dL respectively. The point was excluded from the linear
regression but was included in the consensus error grid analysis.

Glucose results obtained by a HCP on blood samples taken from the palm of the hand
were compared to the glucose results obtained by a HCP on blood samples taken from
the fingertip. It was found that 96% of the results obtained by the HCP on blood
samples taken from the palm of the hand (50/52*) were within the clinically accurate
zone A on consensus error grid analysis when compared to the results obtained by the
HCP on blood obtained from the fingertip. The 2 remaining results fell into the
clinically acceptable zone B. Linear regression analysis was performed and the linear
regression equation and 95% confidence interval for the slope and y-intercept for this
Liberty HCP palm vs. Liberty HCP fingertip comparison data are:
y = 0.97 x (0.89 to 1.05) + 5.0 (-7.8 to 17.7), with Sy.x = 16.0 and r = 0.962.
There is missing data for one sample in this data set: for one sample (ID# 10) an
insufficient sample was applied to the test strip as visually detected for the HCP palm
measurement and on a second attempt an Er4 message was obtained for this HCP
palm result. The Er4 message is displayed when insufficient blood is applied to the
test strip.
Liberty Glucose from Palm by Lay User vs. YSI Fingertip by HCP
Glucose results obtained by lay users on blood samples taken from the palm of the
hand were compared to the plasma glucose results obtained using the YSI reference
method by an HCP on blood samples taken from the fingertip. It was found that 96%
of the Liberty results obtained by the user on blood samples taken from the palm of
the hand (48/50) were within the clinically accurate zone A on consensus error grid
analysis when compared to the YSI plasma glucose results obtained by an HCP on
blood taken from the fingertip. The remaining 2 results fell into the clinically
acceptable zone B. Linear regression analysis was performed and the linear regression
equation and 95% confidence intervals for the slope and y-intercept for this Liberty
user palm vs. YSI plasma glucose from fingertip comparison data are:
y = 0.95x (0.90 to 1.01) + 9.3 (-0.8 to 19.3), with Sy.x = 16.0 and r = 0.979.
There is missing data for three samples in this data set: for two samples (ID# 21 and
ID# 40) there was insufficient sample for YSI measurement; for one sample (ID# 8)
an ER4 message was obtained for the user palm result. The ER4 message is displayed
when insufficient blood is applied to the test strip.

Glucose results obtained by the HCP on blood samples taken from the palm of the
hand were compared to the plasma glucose results obtained using the YSI reference
method by a HCP on blood samples taken from the fingertip. It was found that 98%
of the Liberty results obtained by the HCP on blood samples taken from the palm of
the hand (49/50*) were within the clinically accurate zone A on consensus error grid
analysis when compared to the YSI plasma glucose results by an HCP on blood taken
from the fingertip. The remaining 1 result fell into the clinically acceptable zone B.
Linear regression analysis was performed** and the linear regression equation and
95% confidence intervals for the slope and y-intercept for this Liberty HCP Palm vs.
YSI plasma glucose from fingertip comparison data are:
y = 0.96x (0.89 to 1.04) + 6.4 (-6.4 to 19.1), with Sy.x = 15.9 and r = 0.963.
**While there were no statistical outliers in this data set, inspection of the data
reveals that one data point is influential on the linear regression analysis. This point
(ID# 5: 409 mg/dL for HCP palm and 526 mg/dL for YSI fingertip) had a higher
glucose concentration than all of the rest of the points in the data set (next highest
glucose concentration for YSI fingertip was 278 mg/dL). It was determined that the
better estimate of slope and intercept for this comparison data would be obtained by
exclusion of this data point from the linear regression analysis. This point was
included in the error grid analysis. See summary chart below.

N. Instrument Name:
Liberty™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Liberty™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System used with the Liberty™ Test Strips is a
single use test system used to quantitatively measure blood glucose levels, also known as
blood sugar, from fresh capillary whole blood samples taken from the fingertips or the
palm. The Liberty™ Test Strips are for in vitro diagnostic use only. The Liberty™ Blood
Glucose Monitoring System is not intended for use with neonates.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
The Liberty™ meter stores the last 300 test results with time and date. If the memory is
full, the oldest test result will be deleted and a new test result will be stored in its place.
The Liberty™ Meter calculates averages of all the test results during breakfast, lunch,
dinner and bedtime. Control solution, Hi and Lo test results, out-of-temperature range

results, and results without a valid date/time are not included in the average. This system
does not provide sample identification, but provides real time single use results to the
user. The Liberty™ Meter can provide 14, 30, and 90 Day Trend Graphs.
Breakfast averages include glucose measurements between 4:00 am and 10:00 am, lunch
averages are between 10:00 am and 4:00 pm, dinner averages are between 4:00 pm and
10:00 pm, and bedtime averages are between 10:00 pm and 4:00 am.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Testing on Fingertips – Wash hands with warm soapy water and dry before every
glucose test. Lightly touch the lancing device against the site to be lanced. Press the
release button. Gently squeeze the lanced site, and wipe away the first blood drop that
appears. Squeeze you finger until a second small blood drop forms. Bring test strip to
blood sample. The meter now display the blood drop and test strip symbols. This means
your Liberty™ System is now ready for you to apply blood. Immediately bring the
Liberty™ Test Strip to the blood sample. The test strip fills from the tip. Do not try to
smear blood o the top surface.
The Liberty™ Test Strip acts like a sponge and draws the blood into the test strip through
the sample area. The visual fill window of the Liberty™ Test Strip will now turn red. If
the volume is enabled in SET Options, the meter will beep once when blood is applied to
the Liberty™ Test Strip. On the display, blood drop symbols appear on the test strip
symbol to indicate that blood is filling the Liberty™ Test Strip. The beep (if the volume
is enabled in SET Options) or the moving dot bar indicates that you can remove your
finger from the Liberty™ Test Strip.
As the meter is calculating your results, the 1-2-3 symbol and the graphing area will
progressively appear until your results are displayed. Your test is completed when your
blood glucose test result with time and date is shown on the display. If the volume is
enabled in SET Options, you will hear a beep. Your test result is now stored in the
memory.
Testing on Your Palm – Wash hands with warm soapy water and dry before every
glucose test. Prepare the lancing device by replacing the gray lancing device cap with the
clear cap. You may need to adjust the depth setting of the lancing device to produce a
sufficient blood drop. To increase the blood flow in your palm, rub the area at the base of
your thumb. Press the tip of the clear cap against your skin on the palm of your hand (at
the base of the thumb). Hold the tip to your palm for a few seconds before pressing the
release button. After lancing, hold the lancing device against your skin until a blood
droplet forms. Make sure the blood droplet is large enough to completely fill the visual
fill indicator window of the test strip.
IMPORTANT: When testing on the palm (at the base of the thumb), you may require 28
gauge Liberty™ Lancets in order to obtain enough blood to perform a test. Consult your
physician for a recommendation.

5. Calibration:
Lot Specific adjusted calibration with pre-set test strip code number.
6. Quality Control:
Shake the control solution bottle. Discard the first drop of control solution and wipe of
the bottle tip to ensure a good sample. Gently wet the sample area of the Liberty™ Test
Strip with the control solution. The Liberty™ System will automatically detect if a test is
performed with Liberty™ Control Solution. When the control solution is applied, the
visual fill window on the Liberty™ Test Strip turns blue.
If the volume is enabled in DET Options, the meter will beep once when you should
remove the control solution bottle from the tip of the Liberty™ Test Strip. On the
Liberty™ Meter display, drop symbols appear on the test strip symbol to indicate that the
control solution is filling the Liberty™ Test Strip. The result will appear on the display
screen and, if the volume is enabled, your meter will beep once. The word “control” will
also appear on the display screen. Compare the results of our control solution test to the
range printed on the Liberty™ Test Strip vial label. Your control solution results should
fall within this range. The control solution test result is stored in memory. Two levels of
control material are available.
