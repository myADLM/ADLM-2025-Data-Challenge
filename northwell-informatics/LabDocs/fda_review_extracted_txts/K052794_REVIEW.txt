510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
k052794
B. Purpose for Submission:
New Device
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
DiaSorin Inc.
DiaSorin ETI-MAX 3000™
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
For qualitative and semi-quantitative assays. The instrument performance was
validated using three 510(k) cleared devices (ENA Screen, ANA Screen and Anti-SS-
A (Ro) from Euro-Diagnostica).
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The ETI-MAX 3000™ is a fully automated, EIA microtiter plate laboratory
analyzer performing the complete sample processing (barcode scanner,
predilution station, pipetting station, plate transport, wash station, incubators
and photometric measurement). The instrument is controlled by the Windows
PC software ETI-MAX 3000™. This software allows the user to process the
pre-defined assays of DiaSorin.
The ETI-MAX 3000™ consists of 3 main components; sample processing,
management system and software.
The sample processing system automates the steps required to process
microplate assays from barcode reading, sample distribution, sample dilution,
incubation, washing, reagent addition and detection using absorbance
technology. The plate loading is managed with time scheduling, the plate
capacity is 4, but can be up to 7 in continuous loading mode. There is also the
capability to run multiple assays per plate.
The management system (computer) is a Pentium III, 500MHz, 64 Mbytes
RAM or equivalent with a 3.5” Floppy drive, a 6.4 Gbyte Hard Disk, an
Alphanumeric keyboard, standard Mouse, 15” color monitor, and Standard
Inkjet printer.
The software (Operating system) uses Microsoft Windows® 95, 98 or 2000
32-bit application, for all operations, including assay creation and worklist
generation, time scheduling, data reduction and reporting of results, and has
multi-language capabilities. The software also provides in-process control,
validation and verification.
2. Principles of Operation:
The ETI MAX and its predicate devices share the same principle of operation.
The device consists of pipetting, washing and incubation station and uses the
same basic technology to provide specimen pipetting and dilution, reagent
pipetting, microplate washing and incubation.
1

--- Page 2 ---
The instrument is programmed to mimic the steps of the manual assay procedures
for EIA/ELISA microtiter plate assays.
3. Modes of Operation:
The ETI-MAX 3000™ Analyzer is an open tube, batch mode analyzer with a
continuous load option. The reagent bottles used from the test kit are placed on
the instrument with the caps removed. The sample tubes can be the primary tubes
with stoppers removed or the serum/plasma can be poured off into identified test
tubes.
4. Specimen Identification:
There are multiple ways to identify the patient. Each ETI-MAX 3000™ sample
rack holds 20 patient specimens. The sample rack has a barcode label at each
position which identifies the rack and the unique sample position (1-20). There
are 12 spaces (channels) numbered 1-12 which holds 1 sample rack each. The
samples are placed in the rack and then put onto the instrument where the barcode
scanner reads the barcodes on the rack.
1. The customer can use patient barcode identifiers if so desired. Patients are
placed into samples racks, put on the instrument and the barcode scanner
scans the rack, the rack barcode identifiers and the patient sample barcode
identifier in each position.
2. LIS system – patient ID’s and test requests can be sent to the instrument
through the lab LIS.
3. Manual identification
Patient names/ID’s can be entered via Patient Editor
The ETI-MAX 3000™ Analyzer can be set to pipette the samples in ascending
order, descending order or None (no order).
-Ascending order – the samples will be pipetted in ascending order whether they
are in the same rack or spread throughout several racks.
-Descending order – the samples will be pipetted in descending order whether
they are the same rack or spread throughout several racks.
-None – if this option is selected, the instrument will pipette the all the samples in
positions 1-20, starting in channel 12 (which is always the 1st position loaded)
then once all the samples are pipetted in that rack, it will move to the next rack
(channel 11) and pipette those samples (1-20).
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The DiaSorin assays programmed on the ETI-MAX 3000™ do not use whole
blood. All the DiaSorin assays use either serum or plasma as the sample type.
Samples can be loaded onto the instrument in their primary tubes, or they can be
poured off into test tubes ranging in size from 10 -16 mm in diameter.
If a dilution step is required, the instrument dispenses sample into the specimen
diluent. Once this is completed the samples is then aspirated and dispensed into
2

--- Page 3 ---
the dilution tube a couple of times to ensure a good mixing of the sample and
diluent.
The ETI-MAX 3000™ also performs a shaking of the microtiter plate once the
specimens and reagents are added to the wells.
The operator is responsible for placing samples in the sample racks and loading or
unloading the racks from the ETI-MAX 3000™ analyzer.
6. Calibration:
Each of the instrument modules require calibration. The calibration procedure is
described in the Service manual of the instrument. The calibration procedures do
not use whole blood or commercial calibration materials.
The calibration procedures use a Dye Test that is performed by the Service
Engineers at the time of Installation, whenever service to one of the modules is
performed and at the 6 month PM intervals.
Each assay also has its own calibration (assay verification) to ensure the assay is
valid. Each of these verification specifications that are used for the manual assay
are programmed into the ETI-MAX™ 3000 protocol and are used to ensure the
Validity of the assay on the ETI-MAX 3000™.
7. Quality Control:
The ETI-MAX 3000™ Analyzer in and of itself does not require quality control
procedures or commercial quality control materials. Each individual assay that is
programmed on the ETI-MAX 3000™ follows the quality control information as
recommended in the Instructions for Use for that assay. The quality control used
on the ETI-MAX 3000™ would be the same as required for running the assay by
the manual method.
Additional commercial quality control materials are used by the operator for the
assay as required by their laboratory or regulating agency.
A quality control analysis report (Levy-Jennings plot), are available for tracking
the results of a selected quality control material over a period of time. The QA
Analysis report has to be activated on the ETI-MAX 3000™ by defining QA
Labels in the Lot specific Values dialogue box, while preparing a worklist.
The QA-Label must match the label which is used in the assay layout definition.

d. Carryover:
Study Design
A Reference Plate consisting of 5 strips of Negative samples (n=40) was
tested in each assay (ANA Screen, ENA 6 Screen, and Anti-SS-A (Ro) to
establish the baseline for comparison during the carry over tests. The mean,
SD and +/- 3SD range of the negative sample on the reference plate were
calculated.
Pipettor and Washer Carryover Tests
One high dose sample was tested in replicates of four, followed by a negative
sample tested in replicates of eight (in 3 separate sequences) to evaluate
Pipettor carryover.
Two high dose sample strips (n=16) followed by 2 negative sample strips
(n=16) were tested to evaluate washer carryover.
Acceptance Criteria: The mean of the negative samples on the Pipettor and
Washer Carry Over Test plates within the 3SD range of the Negative Sample
on the Reference Plate.

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
Analytical Sensitivity:
Analytical sensitivity was established using parametric methods for the
determination of Limit of Detection (LOD) according to NCCLS EP17-A. Limit
of Blank (LOB) was estimated from a minimum of 60 measurements of multiple
blank (analyte-free) samples. The Blank standard deviation was multiplied by
1.645 (95th percent of the standard Gaussian distribution) and added to the Blank
average. In order to establish LOD, a sample standard deviation was obtained
from repeated measurement of several low-concentration samples; a minimum of
60 results were then used to calculate a pooled standard deviation. The pooled
standard deviation was multiplied by a term C , representing the 95th percentile of
β
the standard Gaussian distribution and a correction factor, and then added to LOB
to establish LOD.

Assay Drift:
Eight replicates of a low positive sample were tested at the beginning of the plate
in strip 2 (just after the reference sample and assay controls) and again at the end
of the plate in strip 12 to evaluate assay drift. The mean, SD and +/-2SD range
for S/CO and OD were calculated. OD and U/mL were calculated for the
Quantitative Anti-SSA assay.

Acceptance Criteria: The low positive S/CO, U/mL and OD results from strip 12
must fall within the 2 SD range (S/CO, U/mL and OD) calculated for strip 2. If
the results from strip 12 do not fall within the 2SD ranges the assay will need to
be repeated.
