I. Device Description:
The OmegaPoint Systems BreathKeyTM Model g10 and Model g30X are
identical, except that the Model g30X contains an additional internal component
that transmits the breath alcohol level to a remote receiver that is intended to
control the ignition of a motor vehicle.
On the front of both devices is a small speaker, a single ON/OFF button, and the
LCD display. The mouthpiece is located at the top of the unit, and the battery
access cover is located on the back. To perform a breath test, the user presses the
single button on the front of the device. The unit turns on and displays the results
of the previous breath test. WAIT may be displayed for a few seconds while the
device prepares for a reading. When the device displays BLOW, the user is
instructed to blow into the mouthpiece for four seconds in order to obtain a valid
deep lung breath sample. If an appropriate breath sample is provided, the device
will display WAIT for a few seconds while the blood alcohol concentration is
calculated.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
AlcoMate CA2000 Digital Alcohol Detector
Intoxilyzer S-D5
2. Predicate K number(s):
k041334
The Intoxilyzer S-D5 is an evidential breath alcohol device which has been
tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and
appears on their Conforming Products List. It has not been cleared through
the FDA 510(k) process but is considered a “gold standard” and is therefore
an appropriate predicate device.

L. Test Principle:
The sensor has two electrodes in which platinum is fixed to a porous substrate. The
porous substrate operates as a gas permeable membrane and structural support for the
electrode. The electrodes are located on the inside surface of the membrane where they
make contact with sulfuric acid as an electrolyte. When ethanol from a deep lung air
sample diffuses through the porous membrane to reach the working electrode, the ethanol
is oxidized or reduced at the interface of the working electrode and the electrolyte. That
reaction generates an electrical current that is proportional to the concentration of the
ethanol.
The amplifier on the circuit board of the device converts the electrical current from the
alcohol sensor into a voltage, and then sends the voltage to the microprocessor. The
microprocessor converts this voltage into a number that the internal software can then use
as a basis for the calculation of the blood alcohol concentration (BAC). Once the BAC is
calculated, the microprocessor sends the BAC value to the LCD display.
This device uses an algorithm to convert deep lung breath alcohol concentration to blood
alcohol concentration according to the relationship established by Henry’s Law.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The g10 and g30X devices were not eligible for testing by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration. In lieu of NHTSA testing, the sponsor collected
performance data to support a claim of substantial equivalence for the devices.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed precision and accuracy testing using a Breath
Alcohol Sample Simulator (BASS), which provides an alcohol-in-air
test sample with known alcohol concentrations, flow rate, and air
composition.
g10 model
The sponsor performed 20 tests at 0.00% BAC, 20 at 0.02% BAC,
and 20 at 0.08% BAC. Summary results were as follows:
BASS Concentration (% BAC) 0.00 0.02 0.08
Number of Replicates 20 20 20
Mean 0.00 0.020 0.084
Standard Deviation 0.00 0.004 0.005
Coefficient of Variation (%) 0.0 18.3 5.6

[Table 1 on page 4]
BASS Concentration (% BAC)	0.00	0.02	0.08
Number of Replicates	20	20	20
Mean	0.00	0.020	0.084
Standard Deviation	0.00	0.004	0.005
Coefficient of Variation (%)	0.0	18.3	5.6

--- Page 5 ---
Page 5 of 9
g30X model
The sponsor performed a more extensive study based on CLSI
guideline EP10-A2. Summary results were as follows:
BASS Concentration (% BAC) 0.00 0.02 0.08
Number of Replicates 20 20 20
Mean 0.000 0.018 0.072
Standard Deviation 0.00 0.002 0.007
Coefficient of Variation (%) 0.0 11.7 9.2
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
This device will report concentrations from 0.00 to 0.20% BAC.
Since accuracy and precision testing was conducted at
concentrations of 0.00, 0.020, and 0.080 only, true linearity was not
evaluated.
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
This device is traceable to a commercially available certified alcohol
reference solution at a concentration of 0.08% BAC. This solution is
used to calibrate the devices during manufacture.
d. Detection limit:
The NHTSA guidelines do not specifically address the detection
limit of breath alcohol device but require testing at a %BAC of zero
(blank reading) to assess the possibility of false positives. The
sponsor included a zero concentration sample in their precision
studies above. Non-alcoholic human breath was used as the sample.
Neither model produced any false positives when measuring zero
concentration samples.
.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor evaluated the possibility of cigarette smoke interference
with the device. An alcohol-free individual was asked to smoke
approximately one half of a cigarette. Within one minute after
smoking, the subject took a breath alcohol reading. The subject then
smoked another inhalation and repeated the test to produce a total of
five trials. The OmegaPoint device had no positive results.
Other potential interferents were not evaluated with this device.

Coefficient of Variation (%)	0.0	11.7	9.2

f. Temperature:
The sponsor assessed the effect of temperatures over the operating
range (10 to 40o C) of the devices. (If the device is powered on at a
temperature outside the operating range, an error code “HOT” or
“COLD” will be displayed and the device will not operate.) Ten
different devices were tested at each temperature. All testing was
done at a BAC of 0.08%. Summary results were as follows:
Temperature (oC) 10 20 30 40
Number of Replicates 10 10 10 10
Mean 0.088 0.077 0.075 0.072
Standard Deviation 0.009 0.007 0.010 0.009
Coefficient of Variation
9.8 9.0 13.6 13.5
(%)
g. Vibration/Drop Testing:
Drop testing was performed on the g10 model at a BAC of 0.08%.
Prior to testing, the device was dropped 10 times from a height of 5
feet onto a hard surface. After the 10 drops, 10 readings were taken.
Summary results were as follows:
Mean 0.082
Standard Deviation 0.006
Coefficient of Variation (%) 7.4
Drop testing was not performed separately on the g30X model.
h. Assay Cutoff:
In their labeling, the sponsor states that drivers may be impaired at a
BAC of 0.04% or even lower and that it is never safe to drink any
amount of alcohol and drive.
The g30X model can be used in conjunction with a remote receiver
(interlock device) that is intended to control the ignition of a motor
vehicle. The cutoff concentration is set by the interlock device. The
sponsor states that the cutoff concentration will be set at 0.02%
BAC.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The accuracy of this device is addressed in the precision section
above. In addition, the sponsor conducted a method comparison
study comparing the Model g10 to a professional breath alcohol
device. The purpose of the study was to determine if the participants
could operate the device correctly and interpret the results using only
the supplied Operation Manual, and to compare the results to the
professional device. There were 5 participants and a total of 9 paired
comparisons Each participant took their own breath alcohol reading
with the Model g10 and recorded the result. Immediately afterward,
the participants were administered a breath alcohol test using an
Intoximeter S-D5 operated by a trained individual. The breath
alcohol concentrations ranged from a BAC of 0.000 to 0.066 (by the
professional device). Simple linear regression analysis of the data
shows a slope of 0.99, a y-intercept of 0.00, and a correlation
coefficient of 0.99.
The sponsor also conducted a usability and readability study in
which participants were asked to use the device and read the
Operation Manual prior to filing out a questionnaire. There were 51
participants including the 5 participants who provided a breath
sample above. The results are presented below:
