H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
The QMS® Amikacin assay is intended for the quantitative determination of
amikacin in human serum or plasma on automated clinical chemistry analyzers.
The results obtained are used in the diagnosis and treatment of amikacin overdose
and in monitoring levels of amikacin to ensure appropriate therapy.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
This device was used on the Roche Hitachi 717 Analyzer (k872494).
I. Device Description:
The QMS® Amikacin assay consists of separately packaged reagents (R1 and R2)
and calibrators. R1 is the antibody reagent that contains anti-Amikacin monoclonal
antibody (mouse ascites) in a buffer with sodium azide as a preservative. R2 is
Amikacin micro-reagent that contains Amikacin coated microparticles in buffer
containing stabilizers and sodium azide as a preservative. Both reagents are supplied
in liquid form. The calibrators that are provided with the assay were previously
cleared in k903101 as the Innofluor Amikacin Calibrator Set. The calibrators consist
of six levels of one mL liquid form.
The human serum used for the already cleared calibrators were tested by FDA
approved methods and confirmed to be non-reactive for Hepatitis B surface Ag
(HBsAg), HIV Type 1 and 2 antibodies and Hepatitis C antibodies.

L. Test Principle:
The QMS Amikacin assay is a homogeneous particle-enhanced turbidimetric
immunoassay. The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample and
drug coated onto a microparticle for antibody binding sites of the amikacin antibody
reagent. The amikacin-coated microparticle reagent is rapidly agglutinated in the
presence of the anti-amikacin antibody reagent and in the absence of any competing
drug in the sample. The rate of absorbance changed is measured photometrically.
When a sample containing amikacin is added, the agglutination reaction is partially
inhibited, slowing down the rate of absorbance change. A concentration-dependent
classic agglutination inhibition curve can be obtained with maximum rate
agglutination at the lowest amikacin concentration and the lowest agglutination rate at
the highest amikacin concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was determined as described in CLSI protocol EP5. Precision was
run on the Hitatch 717, using QMS Amikacin Calibrators and commercially
available controls. Each sample was run in duplicate for 20 non-consecutive
days. Additionally, within run precision was conducted by re-running the
samples again after two hours. The acceptance criterion was a total CV of
<10%. The results are shown in the tables below:

Accuracy by Recovery was determined by spiking human serum that was
negative for amikacin with USP traceable amikacin to achieve concentrations
of 18.4 and 9.2 µg/mL. The samples were analyzed in duplicate with the QMS
Amikacin assay. Acceptance criterion is 100 + 10 % recovery. The overall
recovery was 94.02%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was conducted and assessed according to CLSI EP6. The sponsor
claims the reportable range of the assay is 1.5 μg/mL to 50 μg/mL. Each level
of calibrator was diluted with equal volumes of the next higher level calibrator
to obtain mid-point concentrations (μg/mL) of 1.5, 6.5, 15.0, 27.5 and 42.5.
Samples were run in duplicate and the mean recovered concentration used.

Mean Percent Recovery 100.41
A linear regression analysis plot of USP Amikacin against recovered amikacin
resulted in a line with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9998, demonstrating
that the assay is linear.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The QMS Amikacin assay does not include amikacin controls or calibrators.
Calibrators were cleared under k903101. The controls used with this assay are
commercially available.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity, or lowest detectable dose (LLD), is defined as the
concentration at which the lowest concentration is distinguishable from zero
with 95% confidence. Sensitivity was established by determining the average
concentration of analyte present in 21 replicated of the zero calibrator. The
analytical sensitivity for this assay was determined to be 0.54 µg/mL which
supports the sponsors claim of 0.8 µg/mL.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Fifty-six serum and plasma samples were tested and compared to the predicate
method. Samples ranged from 2.38 to 37.58 μg/mL. Passing-Bablok
regression analysis yielded an equation of y=1.00x + 0.245 (95% confidence
intervals of the slope and intercept were 0.977 to 1.022 and -0.049 to 0.544,
respectively). The correlation coefficient of the paired data was r = 0.992
b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor demonstrated equivalence between serum and plasma by
conducting the following studies: performance characteristics of the assay for
serum and plasma studies and interferences when using different types of
collection tubes and stability at 2 to 8 ºC and <-10 ºC storage conditions.
Blood was drawn from 10 healthy donors (no amikacin therapy) for each of
the following tube types; plastic K2 and K3 EDTA, glass plasma separator
lithium heparin, glass sodium heparin, glass lithium heparin, glass serum
separator, plastic tube with clot activator, glass tube no additive (served as the
control) and plastic tube no additive. Amikacin was spiked into each of the
samples which were then run in duplicate and the resulted were averaged to
obtain a mean. The results as shown in the table below indicate no significant
differences between the recovery of amikacin in serum or plasma. The
collection tubes evaluated showed no adverse effects on the amikacin
recovery and support the claim for both serum and plasma samples with the

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Therapeutic peak serum values of 20 to 25 µg/mL and tough level of 5 to 10
µg/mL are generally accepted for therapeutic effectiveness. The most serious
toxic effect is permanent damage to the vestibular division of the eighth cranial
nerve, which has been reported to occur most frequently in patients with renal
failure. Toxicity is associated with peak levels greater than 35 µg/mL and trough
values greater than 10 µg/mL. Each laboratory should investigate the
transferability of the expected values to its own patient population and, if
necessary, determine its own reference range.

et al: Amikacin/kanamycin: Therapeutic use and serum concentration monitoring,

Applications of Drug Monitoring. New York, Gross, Townsend, Frank, Inc, 1981:

N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
