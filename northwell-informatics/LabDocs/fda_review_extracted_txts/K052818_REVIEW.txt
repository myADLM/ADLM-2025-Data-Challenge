L. Test Principle:
The Test Principle used by this device is electrochemical biosensor technology using Glucose
Oxidase. Glucose is oxidized to gluconic acid and electrons are produced from the reaction.
The electrons are then trapped by a chemical mediator, potassium ferricyanide. Once the
enzymatic reaction is complete, a potential is provided by the meter for a further
electrochemical reaction in order to generate a current from the release of trapped electrons.
This current is then measured and correlated to the glucose concentration in the whole-blood
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
According to the sponsor precision studies were based on CLSI Document EP5-A2,
The following precision results were obtained from spiked venous blood specimens
assayed at Tyson Bioresearch, Inc. This study included a measurement of strip-to-
strip (within-run) reproducibility by calculating the mean, standard deviation, and %
CV for tests conducted on strips from different lots (between-run).
Whole blood samples from volunteers were collected with heparinized tubes and
were spiked with β-D-Glucose to the desired glucose concentration of 30-50 mg/dL,
51-110 mg/dL, 111-150 mg/dL, 151-250 mg/dL, and 251-400 mg/dL. The YSI 2300
glucose analyzer was used to measure the glucose concentrations in venous samples.
All measurements were done in “Normal Mode” and a calibration mode of “5/15”
(calibrating every 5 measurements or every 15 minutes)
Results:
Within Run and Between Run precision of the EZ SMART-168 Test Strips were
measured with venous blood samples in the laboratory. The precision data for fifty
test strip lots (n = 50) is shown in the tables below:

Document, EP6-A. Venous blood was drawn from healthy volunteers and collected
into lithium heparin tubes. The blood was then placed in a room temperature
environment overnight, until glycolysis occurred and reduced the glucose
concentration to nearly zero. The blood was then pooled and allocated to lithium
heparin tubes. A small amount of high concentration glucose (10,000 mg/dL) was
added to each tube to obtain the desired blood glucose levels needed to perform the
test.
Recovery tests were performed by confirming the blood glucose concentration with
the YSI 2300. Blood samples with glucose concentrations ranging from 20 to 600
mg/dL were then tested with the EZ Smart Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Three
lots of EZ Smart Test Strips, chosen at random, were used during the test. The test
results were evaluated to describe recovery over the entire range of blood glucose
values. A linear regression analysis was performed by the method of least squares (Y
= 0.98X + 3.1, r2 = 0.9986).
The sponsor’s acceptance criteria were: All measurements determined by the EZ
Smart System are within a 15% bias of the reference (YSI 2300) results (glucose
concentration > 100 mg/dL) and a 15 mg/dL bias of the reference (YSI 2300) results
(glucose concentration < 100 mg/dL) see table below:

Closed Vial Stability of Control Solution
Control solution stability studies were assessed by the sponsor using accelerated and
real time aging studies. Five EZ Smart-168 meters and the YSI 2300 Stat Plus
analyzer were used during the testing procedure. The shelf life of closed vial stability
claim is 24 months.
Opened Vial Stability of Control Solution
The sponsor conducted open vial stability studies of control solutions (Level 1, 2, and
3) that were stored at room temperature (15°-28° C). Samples were tested every week
for 4 consecutive weeks, then every other week for the second month, and every
month for the 3 rd to 6th months. Five EZ Smart-168 glucose meters and the YSI 2300
STAT PLUS were used during the testing procedure. The open vial stability claim of
the control solutions is 3 months after opening.
Closed Vial Stability of Test Strips
According to the sponsor the EZ Smart-168 Test Strips are identical to the previously
cleared EZ Smart Test Strips (k040848) that utilize glucose oxidase technology. The
test strip stability was assessed using accelerated and real time aging studies. The
closed vial glucose test strip stability claim is 24 months.
Open Vial Stability of Test Strips
The open vial stability of Test Strips stored at room temperature (15°-28° C) were
performed every week for 4 consecutive weeks, then every other week for the second
month, and every month for the 3 rd to 6th months. The open vial stability claim for the
EZ Smart Test Strips is 3 months when stored as indicated.
d. Detection limit:
The detection range from 20 – 600 mg/dL was demonstrated by measuring recovery
at the low and high end of the range. See linearity/assay detection limit above.
e. Analytical specificity:
According to the sponsor, data were analyzed for chemical interference according to
the guidelines given by CLSI document EP7-P. Several compounds were studied to
determine if their presence affected the reporting of glucose results in whole blood.
Blood samples drawn from healthy donors were collected in to lithium heparin tubes,
pooled and mixed. Drugs were added to whole blood to obtain the desired test
concentrations. Control samples were made by substituting an equal amount of saline
for the volume of drug added to the whole-blood sample, so that the dilutions of the
spiked and control samples were identical. The sponsor’s results are shown in the
table below.

Acetaminophen, Uric Acid, Ascorbic Acid (vitamin C), and other reducing
substances when occurring in normal blood or normal therapeutic concentrations do
not significantly affect results. However, abnormally high concentrations in blood
may cause inaccurately high results.
Lipemic samples: Cholesterol up to 500 mg/dL or Triglycerides up to 2000 mg/dL
do not significantly affect test results. However, glucose values in specimens beyond
these levels should be interpreted with caution.
Temperature and humidity studies were conducted by the sponsor to evaluate the
EZ SMART-168 meter for acceptable performance after exposure to environmental
conditions of 44 °F (7 °C) or 109 °F (43 °C) and 90% relative humidity for 0-12
hours. The sponsors environmental studies were conduced over a temperature range
from (10-40 °C) to (50-104 °F) with increasing and decreasing intervals of 5 °C.
Samples containing four levels of glucose concentrations (68 mg/dL), (156 mg/dL),
(329 mg/dL), and (446 mg/dL) were used. Values obtained were averaged and
standard deviations were calculated and the results were compared with those from
the YSI 2300 glucose analyzer performed at room temperature (23 °C). The sponsor
defined a significant deviation from the reference result as a result larger than 10%
bias from the YSI result. The claimed operating range is 10 – 40 ˚C and 10 – 90%
relative humidity.

Altitude studies were conducted by the sponsor at 164 feet, 7545 feet and 9875 feet
above sea level. Venous samples from healthy volunteers were collected into EDTA
tubes and allocated into 2 ml vials. A small amount of glucose high concentration
(10,000 mg/dL) was added to each vial to obtain the desired glucose levels of 70
mg/dL, 150 mg/dL, 330 mg/dL, and 400 mg/dL. The samples were then tested using
the EZ SmART-168 Blood Glucose Monitoring System and YSI 2300 analyzer. A
linear regression analysis was performed by the method of least squares. The Bias %
results of the EZ SMART-168 Test Strip by venous blood at different altitudes are
shown in the table below.
Altitude 70 mg/dL 150 mg/dL 250 mg/dL 330 mg/dL 400 mg/dL

9875 16.3% 6.8% 14.0% 16.3% 22.1%
The sponsor determined from the above results that the Bias % is below ± 15% when
the altitude is below 7545 feet. Based on the sponsor’s criteria the EZ SMART-168
Blood Glucose Monitoring System should not be used at altitudes above 7545 feet.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable for this type of device.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor compared the clinical accuracy of the EZ Smart-168 Blood Glucose
Monitoring System to the predicate EZ Smart Blood Glucose Monitoring System
(k040848) and the YSI 2300 Stat Plus Glucose Analyzer. A 100 patient in house
consumer study was performed at QC laboratory in Tyson Bioresearch Inc. to assess
the readability of the user's manual, testing accuracy, and user’s satisfaction of the EZ
Smart-168 Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
The patient profiles were recorded by the technician consisting of sex, age and
education. The technician provided the subject with the EZ Sart-168 User’s Manual
and quick reference guide and asked the subject to perform a glucose test based on
the instructions provided. The subject then performed their own finger stick and ran
the test with the EZ Smart-168 glucose meter and the predicate EZ Smart meter from
the original finger stick and record their results on the questionnaire provided.
The technician then performed the test with the EZ Smart-168 and predicate EZ

The Normal fasting blood glucose range for a non-diabetic adult is 70-110 mg/dL (3.9 to
6.1 mmol/L). One to two hours after meals, normal glucose values should be less than
120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L). Consult your physician or healthcare professional for the target
glucose values that are right for you.
Expected blood glucose levels for people without diabetes:
Time Range mg/dL Range mmol/L
Before breakfast 70-105 3.9-5.8
Before lunch or dinner 70-110 3.9-6.1
1 hour after meals Less than 160 Less than 8.9
2 hours after meals Less than 120 Less than 6.7
Between 2 and 4 AM Greater than 70 Greater than 3.9

6. Quality Control:
The EZ Smart-168 control solutions are used to check the performance of the EZ Smart-
168 meter, Test Strips, and testing technique. The EZ Smart-168 Blood Glucose
Monitoring System is performing correctly if the control solution test results fall within
the specific control solution range listed on the EZ Smart-168 Test Strip Vial.
Note: EZ Smart-168 Control Solutions are required but not supplied with Test Strips for
checking the system. There are three aqueous EZ Smart-168 Control Solutions (Low,
Normal, and High) that are available for the user to choose from. The sponsor
recommends the use of at least a normal and high control solution to check the accuracy
of the system. For more information about the EZ Smart-168 Control Solution, see the
EZ Smart-168 Control Solution package insert.
