c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
The controls are manufactured by processing human whole blood and
extracting purified A1C concentrate. Level 1 is made entirely from base
material (hemolysate). Levels 2 and 3 are made with base blood
material blended with purified A1C until the HbA1C value of the blend
is within the target ranges for %HbA1c listed below (as assayed on the
Bio-Rad Variant II):
Level 1 4.6 - 6.0
Level 2 9.5 - 11.0
Level 3 14.0 - 16.0
Total hemoglobin values are endogenous. Values for both analytes are
assigned by replicate analyses.
Open vial stability study time is defined to be at least 20% longer than
the claimed open vial stability for the product and determined at a
minimum of three time points (T , T and T ). Controls are
zero final final+20%
assayed to ensure the accuracy and precision of the testing methods.
Failure criterion is defined as the T being ± 10% of the T . Claim:
final zero

Accelerated stability testing studies are performed on pilot lots at
elevated temperatures (ie 47 oC, 41 oC, 35 oC, etc.) in order to observe
changes in product performance more rapidly than would be seen
under normal conditions of -10 to -70 oC. Controls are assayed to

ensure the accuracy and precision of the testing methods. Several time
points (T and other regular interval points) are generated for each
zero
temperature to predict shelf life using a stability model with activation
energy of the 20-kCal/mol or Arrhenius Model predictions. Claim: 3
years when stored tightly capped at -10 to -70 oC or 6 months when
stored tightly capped at 2 oC to 8 oC.
Real time stability testing is determined by storing the product under
the recommended storage conditions (-10 to -70 oC and 2 oC to 8 oC)
for the life of the product. These studies are conducted on production
lots and are long term studies. Several vials of each lot are tested at
each time point and the results of the real time samples are compared
to the results of several reference vials stored at -70oC. Failure is
assumed to have taken place when the product’s analyte concentration
has changed by greater than or equal to the established recovery
criteria.
