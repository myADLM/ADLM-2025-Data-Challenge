4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable, as the device is a visually-read single-use device.
I. Device Description:
The Forsure Rapid One Step Multiple (X) Abuse Drug Screen Test Cup Device and
holder are designed to hold one or up to twelve individual chromatographic absorbent
strips in which the drug or drug metabolites in the sample compete with a drug
conjugate immobilized on a porous membrane support for the limited antibody sites.
The method employs unique monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to selectively
identify the drug or drug metabolite in the sample. The membrane on the strip is
coated with goat anti-mouse antibody and a specific drug-protein conjugate. The
sample pad contains a colloidal gold labeled mouse monoclonal anti specific drug
antibody. The device is for single-use and visually read.

Department of Health and Human Services, Mandatory Guidelines for Federal
Workplace Drug Testing Program, Fed Register. 53(69): 11970-11979, 1988

Monograph 73, 1986
L. Test Principle:
The Forsure Rapid One Step Multiple (X) Abuse Drug Screen Test Cup Device and
holder are designed to hold one or up to twelve individual chromatographic absorbent
strips in which the drug or drug metabolites in the sample compete with a drug
conjugate immobilized on a porous membrane support for the limited antibody sites.
As the sample flows through the absorbent device by chromatography, the labeled
antibody-Gold sol conjugate binds to the free drug in the sample forming an
antibody-antigen complex. This complex competes with immobilized antigen
conjugate in the test zone. If the concentration of drug is above the cutoff
concentration no magenta colored band will form, indicating a positive result. If the
concentration of drug in the sample is below the cutoff, a magenta colored band will
form, indicating a negative result. Unbound dye conjugate binds to the reagent in the
control zone, producing a magenta colored band, regardless of the presence or
absence of drug or drug metabolite in the urine sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed using in house drug standards. The standard
was diluted in drug-free urine to give drug concentrations at the following
levels: 0, 50%, 75%, 100%, 125% and 150% of the cutoff. A total of 15
determinations were made at each concentration for each analyte. Testing was
performed on one day by one operator. All samples at 0 and -50% yielded
negative results and all samples 150% yielded positive results. Within lot
precision study data for 75%, 100%and 125% is summarized below:

Inter Lot precision:
To test inter lot precision, drug-free urine was spiked with commercially
available drug standard to the following levels: 0, 50%, 75%, 100%, 125% and
150% of cutoff. Testing was performed using three different lot numbers, 15
samples of each lot were run at each of the concentrations for each drug over 20
days. All samples tested at 0, -50% yielded negative results and all samples at
150% yielded positive results. Inter lot Precision Study data for 75%, 100% and

laboratory practice to confirm the test procedure and to verify proper test
performance. User should follow local, state and federal guidelines for testing
QC material.
Stability:
Real time and accelerated studies have been conducted. Protocols and
acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The
manufacturer claims the following expiration date:
When stored at 15 – 28 ºC product is good until expiration date which is 18
months.
Storage of sample:
To determine if there was any effect on the specimen from prolonged
exposure to the device the following study was performed. An in-house
positive urine control containing drug for each analyte in the test device was
tested on the Chromatograph Mass Spectrometry GC/MS to obtain an initial
value. The sample was then aliquot into the test device and moderately shaken
for 10 minutes, then stored at room temperature (15-30 ºC) for total of 60
hours. Samples for GC/MS analysis were taken at times 0, 12, 36 and 60
hours. The results demonstrate that the test device did not affect the expected
or accuracy of the results.
d. Detection limit:
A drug-free urine pool was spiked with specific drug at the following
concentrations: 25% and 50% below the cutoff, cutoff and 25% above the
cutoff. The results are presented in the table below:

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking various concentrations of similarly
structured drug compounds into normal human urine. By analyzing various
concentration of each compound the sponsor determined the concentration of
the drug that produced a response approximately equivalent to the cutoff
concentration of the assay. Results of those studies appear in the tables
below:

The following list of substances showed no interference at the following

Bilirubin 0.2 -1.0 mg/dL
Creatinine 500 mg/dL
Glucose 1500 mg/dL

Potassium 10-110 mEq/dL
Human Serum Albumin 500 mg/dL
Globulin 1500 mg/dL
Sodium chloride 0-6000 mg/dL
Uric Acid 23 mg/dL
Cholesterol 500 mg/dL
Specific Gravity:
Two drug free urines, one with a specific gravity of 1.030 and the other 1.003.
The sample was divided into two and one was spiked with drug concentration
at 25% above the cutoff for all the analytes. Each sample was run in duplicate.
The results demonstrate that a specific gravity range of 1.003 – 1.030 did not
affect the expected or accuracy of the results.
pH:
The pH of an aliquot negative urine pool was adjusted to a pH range of 4 to 9
in 1 pH increments for a total of six samples. Each of the samples was split
into two samples to form a pair for each pH level. One of the paired samples
from each set was spiked with drug concentration at 25% above the cutoff for
all the analytes. Each sample was run on the device and the results
demonstrate that varying ranges of pH dose not interfere with the performance
of the test.

f. Assay cut-off:
The identified cutoff concentrations for amphetamine, cocaine,
methamphetamine, opiates 2000, Phencyclidine and THC are those
recommended by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA). The SAMHSA has not recommended a cutoff
concentration for Barbiturate, Benzodiazepine, Oxycodone, Propoxyphene
and Tricyclic Antidepressant (TCA).
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed
cutoff concentration appears in the precision and detection limit sections,
above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
83-110 urine samples, depending on the drug type were evaluated. Specimens
obtained from a reference laboratory were tested using the Forsure Rapid One
Step Multiple (X) Abuse Drug Screen Test Cup Device and the Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). For each tested,
approximately 10% of samples had drug concentration between 50% below
the cutoff and the cutoff concentration, another 10% of samples had drug
concentration between the cutoff and 50% above the cutoff concentration.

During the accuracy for Amphetamine and Methamphetamine testing one
discordant result was observed. A sample was run for both analytes, during
the Amphetamine testing the PCP was recorded as positive and in the
Methamphetamine the PCP was recorded as negative. The results were not
confirmed by a reference method.
During the accuracy of the other analytes there were positive results recorded
for analytes other then the one being tested. None of the other results were
confirmed by a reference method.
