2. Indication(s) for use:
Indicated for the serial measurement of CA 19-9 to aid in the management of
patients diagnosed with cancers of the pancreas. Serial testing for patient CA
19-9 values is used in conjunction with other clinical methods in the
management of pancreatic cancer patients.
3. Special condition for use statement(s):
Patients must be Lewis blood group antigen positive. Patients known to be
genotypically negative for Lewis blood group antigen are unable to produce
the CA 19-9 antigen even in the presence of malignant tissue. Phenotyping

Special guidance “Guidance Document for the Submission of Tumor Associated
Antigen premarket Notifications (510(k)s) to FDA”. CLSI guidelines include EP5-A
(Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices),EP7-A
(Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry Devices), EP9-A2 (Method Comparison
and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples), EP6-P2 (Evaluation of the Linearity of
Quantitative Analytical Methods – Proposed Guideline),C28-A2 (How to Define and
Determine reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory) and EP14-A (Evaluation of
Matrix Effects).
L. Test Principle:
The VITROS CA 19-9™ assay is a two-step immunometric assay. CA 19-9 antigen
present in the sample reacts with a biotinylated mouse monoclonal anti-CA 19-9
antibody. The antigen-antibody complex is captured by streptavidin on the wells and
unbound materials are removed by washing. After washing, HRP-labeled anti-CA
19-9 conjugate is added and binds to the CA 19-9 on the immobilized
antigen/antibody complex. Unbound conjugate is removed by washing. When a
reagent containing luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt)
and an electron transfer agent is added, the HRP in the bound conjugate catalyzes the
oxidation of the luminal derivative and produces light. The electron transfer agent
increases the level of light produced and prolongs the light emission. The light
signals are read by the VITROS ECi Instrument System. The amount of HRP
conjugate bound is directly proportional to the concentration of CA 19-9 in the
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
i. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated according to CLSI EP5-A2. Three patient serum
pools were tested in duplicate, two runs per day for 20 nonconsecutive
days over 28 days on two instruments and two lots of CA 19-9 reagents
and calibrators. Singleton determinations of the calibrators were
performed on the first run of Day 1 (a) and again on the first run of the
first day of each subsequent week (b). CA 19-9 values were determined
by calibration curve established in (a) and (b). Results are summarized
below.

Linearity was evaluated according to CLIS EP6-P2. A low (7.38 U/mL
CA 19-9) and a high (1091 U/mL CA 19-9) serum pool were mixed to
give 7 pools of intermediate CA 19-9 concentrations. Ten singleton
determinations of pool 1 and 9 and three singleton determinations of each
of pool 2 to 8 were tested using two reagent and calibrator lots on one
VITROS instrument. The concentrations of pool 2 to 8 were calculated
using the following equation:
(L x Conc. Pool 1) + (H x Conc. Pool 9)
10
Where L = Ratio of Pool 1 used for blending, e.g. 9 for Pool 2
H = Ratio of Pool 9 for blending, e.g. 1 for Pool 2
The means of Pools 1 and 9 were determined using 20 replicates from the
combinations of Reagent/Calibrator. The means of Pools 2 to 8 were
determined using the 6 replicates from both reagent/calibrator
combinations and expressed as a percentage of the calculated
concentrations. The percentage ranged from 96.9% to 102% with a mean
of 99.3%. Linear regression analysis of the measured and calculated
concentrations yielded a slope of 1.01, a y-intercept of -5.87 and r2 = 1.
High sample dilution was assessed by assaying diluted series of 12 serum
samples in singleton using two reagent and calibrator lots on two VITROS
systems. The samples were diluted manually to 1/2, 1/5, 1/10, 1/15 and
1/20 with VITROS High Sample Diluent B. For samples with neat
concentration above the assay range, the neat concentration was calculated
from the first dilution. When compared to the neat sample, the overall
mean percent recovery for all samples was 101% ranged from 97% to
108%.
Spike recovery – Ten normal human serum samples with known
endogenous CA 19-9 leves were used. Aliquots of each sample were
spiked with a different concentration of CA 19-9 (120.8, 249.47, 528.3
and 832.0 U/mL). Each sample was assayed in duplicate. The mean
percent recovery across all concentrations and all samples was 93.1%
(ranged from 90.4% to 96.8%) and met the acceptance criterion of 100 ±
15%.
The assay measuring range is from 0 U/mL to 1000 U/mL.
iii. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
There is no known reference standard for CA 19-9. The VITROS CA 19-
9™ reference calibrators were standardized against the Fujirebio
Diagnostics, Inc. CA 19-9 reference preparation. The VITROS CA 19-
9™ reference calibrators are manufactured volumetrically and assayed
using the Fujirebio Diagnostics Inc. CA 19-9™ RIA assay. The values
were validated by a panel of patient serum samples measured by both

--- Page 6 ---
Page 6 of 11
VITROS and Fujirebio Diagnostics Inc. CA 19-9™ assays. The VITROS
reference calibrators are used for manufacture of the calibrator kits.
iv. Detection limit (functional sensitivity):
The minimal detectable dose (MDD) was determined by testing two lots
of VITROS CA 19-9™Calibrator Matrix (0 U/mL) and each of 5 serum
samples with CA 19-9 values < 5 U/mL in replicates of 10 on three
instruments using two lots of calibrators and two lots of VITROS CA 19-
9™ Reagents. The LOD was defined as the limit of the blank (LOB) plus
one tailed-95% confidence range for a low sample, i.e. 1.645 (SD of low
sample). Two lots of the low range verifier were used to determine LOB.
Since the instrument only reports positive results, results were pooled and
the rank order method was used to determine the 95th percentile for the
assay and LOB was determined to be 1.05 U/mL. Five samples were used
to determine the sample SD. Samples with average values below zero
were excluded from analysis. The pooled SD of the remaining samples
was 0.277 U/mL. The LOD is equal to (LOB + 1.645SD ) which is
sample
1.42 U/mL.
v. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous substances - Interference was determined by spiking a known
amount of an interfering substance into aliquots of five serum samples
supplemented with CA 19-9. Interfering substances tested included
hemoglobin (150, 300 and 600 mg/dL), bilirubin (22 mg/dL), triglycerides
(3000 mg/dL), biotin (10 ng/mL) and total protein (10 g/dL). Spiked and
non-spiked samples were tested in duplicate and percent recoveries were
calculated. Except for hemoglobin which is a known interferent, the
percent mean recoveries for the other substances ranged from 97.2% for
total protein to 100.2% for bilirubin at the levels tested. The average
recoveries for hemoglobin levels 150, 300 and 600 mg/mL were 114.4%,
133.2% and 156.4% respectively. A warning is included in the package
insert under Limitations of the Procedure.
Chemotherapeutic substances – Interference was determined by spiking
the following pharmaceutical compounds into aliquots of five CA 19-9
supplemented serum samples and assayed: Leucovorin/Folinic Acid (11.4
mg/dL), Gemzar/Gemcitabine HCl (38.2 mg/dL), Streptozotocin/Zanosar
(28 mg/dL), Doxorubicin (40 µg/mL). Cyclophosphamide/Cytoxan (37.5
mg/dL), Cisplatin-Dichloride (5.7 mg/dL), 5-Flourouracil/Adrucil (39
mg/dL), Methotrexate/Amethopterin-Hydrate (91 mg/dL), Tamoxifen
(2.28 µg/dL), Cytarabine (3 mg/dL) and Paclitaxel/Taxol (6.7 mg/dL).
Spiked and non-spiked samples were tested in replicates and percent
recoveries were calculated. At the concentrations tested, the percent mean
recoveries ranged from 96.8% to 105.5%.
Human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) - To assess interference due to
HAMA, five HAMA positive samples and one normal sample were
studied. Each sample was split into three aliquots. One aliquot was

--- Page 7 ---
Page 7 of 11
spiked with CA 19-9 antigen to achieve 35 U/mL while the second aliquot
was spiked with the same volume of antigen to achieve 250 U/mL. The
third aliquot was spiked with an equivalent volume of antigen free matrix
and served as the control. All aliquots were run in duplicate in the same
run. Percent recoveries were calculated and for the HAMA samples with
35 U/mL CA 19-9, the % recovery ranged from 88.9% to 100% (mean =
96.7%) and for samples with 250 U/mL CA 19-9, the % recovery ranged
from 92.1% to 100.6% (mean = 97.5%). The following table summarizes
the results.

Rheumatoid factor (RF) - To assess interference due to RF, five RF
positive samples and one normal sample were tested. Each sample was
split into three aliquots. One aliquot was spiked with CA 19-9 antigen to
achieve 35 U/mL while the second aliquot was spiked with the same
volume of antigen to achieve 250 U/mL. The third aliquot was spiked
with an equivalent volume of antigen free matrix and served the control.
All aliquots were run in duplicate in the same run. Percent recoveries
were calculated and recoveries for samples with 35 U/mL CA 19-9 ranged
from 84.6% to 98.4% (mean = 93.4%) and for samples with 250 U/mL
CA 19-9, % recovery ranged from 90.9% to 98.3% (mean = 95.6%).

values outside the dynamic range of the Fujirebio assay were diluted per
package inserts. Twenty-four samples were excluded from analysis
because the CA 19-9 values were below the LOD of the VITROS (23)
and/or Fujirebio assay (10). Twenty-five samples with CA 19-9 values
above 1000 U/mL were also excluded. The remaining 176 samples were
analyzed by Passing-Bablok linear regression analysis. The CA 19-9
concentrations of the specimen as determined by the Fujirebio CA 19-9™
RIA ranged from 2.36 to 892 U/mL as compared to 1.7 to 653 U/mL on
the VITROS assay. The Passing-Bablok linear regression analysis yielded
a slope of 0.83 (95% CI 0.80, 0.88) and y-axis intercept of -0.40 U/mL
(95% CI -1.3, -0.27) with a Spearman Correlation coefficient of 0.93.
In addition to regression analysis, samples were also evaluated to the
percent agreement with the predicate device using 37 U/mL as the cut-off
(see table below):

ii. Matrix comparison:
Matched human serum and plasma samples were collected in the
following tube types: serum clot, serum separator tube (SST),
EDTA, lithium heparin and sodium heparin. Twenty-six sample sets
were assayed unchanged. Sample sets from 24 subjects were
subdivided into 4 groups and each group was spiked with different
concentrations of CA 19-9 (final concentrations of 50, 100, 200 and
650 U/mL). All samples were tested in duplicate and within 36
hours of sample draw. Results of the average recovery for each

Serial Monitoring Analysis
Two hundred and sixty one serum samples from 74 patients with
confirmed pancreatic cancer collected and banked at two US clinical sites
were analyzed. The average number of sample pairs per patient was 3.5
(see table below)
Number Number of Frequency Percent
in Series Observation Pairs
3 2 36 48.6
4 3 37 50.0
5 4 1 1.4
The average age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 61.8 years
ranging from 41 to 85 years. Fifty-five percent were males and forty-five
percent females. Eighty percent of the patients were Caucasians, the
remaining 20% consisted of African-Americans (11%), Hispanics (8%)
and Asians (1%). Only 9% of the patients were current smokers, 51%
were past smokers and 38% nonsmokers (smoking status of one patient
was unknown). At the time of diagnosis, 30% of the patients had diabetes
and 27% had other medical conditions. Of the diabetic patient subset,
64% were males.
Seventy of the 74 patients had disease stage information: 3 Stage I, 5
Stage II, 31 Stage III, and 31 Stage IV. Ninety-five percent of the
pancreatic tumors were adenocarcinomas with 65% involving the head of
the pancreas. In addition, histology stratification showed that 13.51%
were well differentiated, 22.97% moderately differentiated, 5.41% poor to
moderately differentiated, 12.16% poorly differentiated and 45.95% as
other.
Changes in CA 19-9 concentrations and changes in disease state were
analyzed on a per-visit basis. A significant change in CA 19-9 was
defined as greater than 12.5% (2.5 times the total precision %CV). The
following tables show the association between CA 19-9 concentrations
and disease status for the 187 evaluable observation pairs. The 95%
confidence intervals for the concordance statistics were based on General
Estimable Equations and calculated using the GENMOD procedure of
SAS.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The normal reference range was established by testing serum samples from
200 subjects (100 males and 100 females). No other demographic information
was provided. Samples were assayed in singleton. The mean CA 19-9
concentration was 11.53 U/mL (SD = 11.67 U/mL) and median of 7.955
U/mL. A cumulative distribution was established and the 99th percentile was
determined to be 62.71 U/mL, the 97.5th percentile was 37.3 U/mL and the
95th percentile was 31.58 U/mL. The table below shows the distribution of
CA 19-9 results.
