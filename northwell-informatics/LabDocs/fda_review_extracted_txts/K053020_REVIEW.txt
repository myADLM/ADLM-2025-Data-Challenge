utilizes direct chemiluminometric technology. The Binary Lite reagent includes a
polyclonal goat anti-troponin I antibody labeled with acridinium ester and two
biotinylated monoclonal anti-troponin I antibodies. The solid phase reagent is
magnetic latex particles conjugated with streptavidin. The antibodies in the Binary
Lite reagent bind to troponin I in the sample. The biotin contained in the immune
complex then binds to the streptavidin-labeled magnetic particles. A direct
relationship exists between the amount of troponin I present in the patient sample and
the amount of relative light units (RLU) detected by the system.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Imprecision studies were conducted over a 20 day period on two instruments
with commercially available control materials and patient pools. The
following samples were run in duplicate in one run per day per system.

To determine the functional sensitivity of the assay, a series of low serum
pools was prepared by sequential dilution of a low sample with a negative
serum pool and run on two instruments over a 20 day period. Recoveries for
the low serum pools and controls from the two instruments were combined
and the total % C.V. was calculated. The level for the 10% and 20% total CV
was estimated to be 0.042 ng/mL and 0.022 ng/mL respectively. The upper
99th percentile of normal distribution was found to be 0.044 ng/mL for serum
(n=648).
The assay meets the guidelines from the European Society of Cardiologist and
American College of Cardiology that the assay demonstrate an imprecision
(total % CV) of 10% or less at the 99th percentile of a normal reference
population.

To determine the high dose effect related with the ADVIA Centaur® TnI-
Ultra Assay, high levels of troponin I antigen was spiked into negative serum
pools. The reaction rates of the spiked samples were obtained from the
ADVIA Centaur® TnI-Ultra Assay. There was no drop in rates for TnI
concentrations up to 1000 ng/mL.
Serum samples with high troponin I concentrations were diluted with negative
serum and obtained expected concentrations ranging from 0.724 ng/mL to
44.35 ng/mL. When compared to the expected value, the measured
(observed) values of troponin I averaged 103% with a range of 91.6 to 113%.
In addition, linearity was also studied in a high dose dilution recovery study.
A high patient pool was created by diluting a patient sample (> 50ng/mL) with
a negative patient sample. The observed concentrations ranged from 8.59 to
49.76 and the recoveries ranged from 96% to 100%. The linearity (from 8.59
to 49.76 ng/mL) equation for observed (y) and Theoretical (x) was y=0.999x -
0.42 with a R2 of 0.999.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ADVIA Centaur TnI-Ultra method is standardized to an internal standard
manufactured using purified materials. Assigned values of the calibrators are
traceable to this standard. The calibrator value is assigned through a two step
process. The lyophilized calibrators are value assigned as zero to
approximately 40 ng/mL. All future lots of calibrators will be value assigned
against the master lot via nested testing procedures. The test lot and the
master lot, together with previous lots, are value assigned through nested
testing in the same run using ten replicates for each control level. The
ADVIA Centaur system uses 2-point calibration of a master curve that is
distributed with the reagent as a printed master curve card. The system uses
the RLU’s of the calibrators to adjust the master curve and this adjusted
master curve is used for all calculations of patient sample and control doses.
The sponsor suggests that calibration should occur with every new reagent lot
and/or every 28 days within a lot.
Calibrators, after storage at the recommended storage condition are tested
through the recommended shelf life. Shelf life was determined by analyzing
calibrators throughout the time frame. The calibrators are assessed with dose
determinations from the gold master curve as well as in its ability to calibrate
an assay and recover appropriate control doses. The calibrators are stable for
10 months or until the expiration listed on the calibrator.
d. Detection limit:
The minimum detectable concentration (analytical sensitivity) was determined
by running twenty replicated of a negative serum pool. The mean RLU’s and
SD from the negative serum pool were calculated. The concentration
5

--- Page 6 ---
corresponding to rate + 2xSD was determined to be 0.008 ng/mL. The
analytical determination was calculated on a base pool by assaying in five
replicates on the three instruments over four days using two lots.

e. Analytical specificity:
Potential cross reactants to troponin I were spiked into negative serum pool
and tested for cross reactivity. Cardiac troponin T, troponin C, skeletal
troponin I, actin, CK-MB and myoglobin all showed negligible cross
reactivity.
Serum pools spiked with hemoglobin up to 500 mg/dL, triglyceride up to
1000 mg/dL, bilirubin up to 20 mg/dL and albumin up to 6500 mg/dL showed
less than 10% interference.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Correlation of the ACS:180 cTnI assay versus the ADVIA Centaur® TnI
Ultra assay was evaluated with serum samples. Two sets of ranges were
analyzed and calculated in order to capture medically relevant doses: 0.1 to
approximately 35 ng/mL and 0.1 to approximately 4.0 ng/mL. The results
were analyzed with the Passing-Bablok regression in addition to the least-
squares regression method. The results for both ranged are summarized
below.

b. Matrix comparison:
Lithium heparin and serum sample pairs were assayed with the ADVIA
Centaur® TnI-Ultra Assay. The linear regression equations are below:
y(Heparinized plasma)= 0.91x(serum) +0.67 ; r=0.964 and n=53.
Y(EDTA plasma)= 0.81x(serum) + 0.15 ; r=0.964 and n=31.
Evaluation of heparinized and EDTA plasma samples resulted in a mean 1%
and 4% decrease in observed values, respectively, compared to serum. The
labeling contains the instructions that plasma and serum samples from the
same patient should not be used interchangeably with this test.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The clinical sensitivity based on the ACS:180 assay, to which this assay is
equivalent, was determined to be 97.3%.
b. Clinical specificity:
The clinical specificity based on the ACS:180 assay, to which this assay is

4. Clinical cut-off:
Using the definition of MI as described by the World Health Organization
(WHO), evaluation of a population consisting of patients from multiple clinical
sites was previously performed using the ACS:180 cTnI assay. The patient
population which included both males and females consisted of 112 individuals
who ruled-in for AMI and 166 individuals who ruled-out for AMI. Results from
clinical data were analyzed based on Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC)
plots using the guidelines presented in CLSI document GP10-A. A 0.9 ng/mL
diagnostic cutoff was determined.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The upper 99th percentile of normal distribution was determined using 648 healthy
individuals ranging from 17 to 91 years of age. The samples were assayed with
the TnI-Ultra method and the troponin values were numerically ranked. The 99th
percentile was found to be 0.04 ng/mL.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
