H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Acro Rapid Methamphetamine Urine Test is a lateral flow, rapid immunoassay
for the qualitative detection of Methamphetamine in human urine at a cutoff of
500 ng/mL. The test is used to obtain a visual qualitative result and is intended for
laboratory use only.
This assay provides only preliminary result. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment must be applied to a drug test result, particularly in
evaluating a preliminary positive result. In order to obtain a confirmed analytical
result, a more specific alternate chemical method is needed. Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy (GC/MS) analysis is preferred.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable, the device is a visually-read single-use device
I. Device Description:
The device consists of a strip within a cassette. (See Test Principle, below.)
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Ameditech Immutest Drug Screen Methamphetamine
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
k012585
3. Comparison with predicate:
The intended use and general methodology is similar for both devices. The cutoff
concentration is lower for this device (500 ng/mL) than for the predicate device
(1000 ng/mL).

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced
L. Test Principle:
The Acro Rapid Methamphetamine Urine Test is based on the principle of
competitive immunochemical reaction between an immobilized drug-protein
conjugate and the drug or drug metabolites, which may be present in the urine sample
for limited binding sites of a labeled antibody. The test contains a nitrocellulose
membrane strip pre-coated with drug-protein conjugate in the test region and a
wicking pad containing colored antibody-colloidal gold conjugate. During the test,
the urine sample migrates on the strip and hydrates the antibody-colloidal gold
conjugate. The mixture then migrates along the membrane chromatographically by
capillary action to the immobilized drug-protein band in the test region. When drug is
absent in the urine, the colored antibody-colloidal gold conjugate and immobilized
drug-protein bind specifically to form a visible line in the test region (test line). When
methamphetamine is present in the urine sample, it will compete with the drug-
protein for the limited antibody binding sites. When the drug is present in sufficient
concentration in the urine sample, it will fill the limited antibody binding sites, which
will inhibit attachment of the colored antibody-colloidal gold conjugate to the drug-
protein conjugate in the test region. Therefore the presence of the test line indicates a
negative result for methamphetamine and the absence of the test line indicates a
preliminary positive result for methamphetamine.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the device was evaluated at multiple biotech company
sites, and one hospital site. Each site tested the device against masked urine
control samples containing 0, 250, 375, 625, 750 and 1000 ng/mL
Methamphetamine. Similar performance was observed at the various sites.
Composite results are shown below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Procedural controls are included in the test strip of the device. A line
appearing in the control region confirms that sufficient specimen volume was
added to the device.
External control materials are not supplied with this test; however the labeling
includes a recommendation that external positive and negative controls be
tested to ensure proper kit performance. Users should follow local, state and
federal guidelines for testing QC material.
d. Detection limit:
See Precision/Reproducibility (section 1a), above.
e. Analytical specificity:
The following compounds were serially diluted 1:1 and added to
methamphetamine-negative urine. They produced positive results with the
Acro Rapid Methamphetamine Urine Test at the concentrations indicated in
the table below:
Compound Concentration
(ng/mL)
d-Methamphetamine 500
d-Amphetamine 50,000
l-Amphetamine >100,000
(+/-)3,4-MDEA 50,000

(+/-)3,4-MDMA 2,000
l-Methamphetamine 10,000
Ephedrine 100,000
Mephentermine 50,000
Note: Drugs or drug metabolites not listed may interfere with
methamphetamine assays and cause false results.
The compounds listed below were added to a pool of urine samples containing
amphetamine spiked to 250 ng/mL, and 1000 ng/mL. These substances did
not alter expected results at the indicated concentrations.
Acetaminophen (100 ug/mL) Hemoglobin (500 ug/mL)
