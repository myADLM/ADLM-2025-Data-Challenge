H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Acro Rapid THC (Marijuana) Urine Test is a lateral flow, rapid immunoassay for
the qualitative detection of tetrahydrocannabinol in human urine at a cutoff of 50
ng/mL. The test is used to obtain a visual qualitative result and is intended for
laboratory use only.
This assay provides only a preliminary result. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment must be applied to a drug test result, particularly in
evaluating a preliminary positive result. In order to obtain a confirmed analytical
result, a more specific alternate chemical method is needed. Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy (GC/MS) analysis is preferred.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable, the device is a visually-read single-use device
I. Device Description:
The device consists of a strip within a cassette. (See “Test Principle” below.)
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Ameditech Immutest Drug Screen THC
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
k011813
3. Comparison with predicate:
The intended use and general methodology is similar for both devices.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced
L. Test Principle:
From the package insert: Acro Rapid THC (Marijuana) Urine Test is based on the
principle of competitive immunochemical reaction between an immobilized drug-
protein conjugate and THC, which may be present in the urine sample for limited
binding sites of a labeled THC antibody. The test contains a nitrocellulose membrane
strip pre-coated with drug-protein conjugate in the test region and a wicking pad
containing colored antibody-colloidal gold conjugate. During the test, the urine
sample is allowed to migrate upward and hydrate the antibody-colloidal gold
conjugate. The mixture then migrates along the membrane chromatographically by
capillary action to the immobilized drug-protein band in the test region. When drug is
absent in the urine, the colored antibody-colloidal gold conjugate and immobilized
drug-protein bind specifically to form a visible line in the test region (test line). When
THC is present in the urine sample, it will compete with the drug-protein conjugate
for the limited antibody binding sites. The test line will be less intense with increasing
drug concentration. When the drug is present in sufficient concentration in the urine
sample, it will fill the limited antibody binding sites, which will inhibit attachment of
the colored antibody-colloidal gold conjugate to the drug-protein conjugate in the test
region. Therefore the presence of the test line indicates a negative result for THC and
the absence of the test line indicates a preliminary positive result for THC.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the device was evaluated at multiple biotech company
sites, and one hospital site. Each site tested the device against masked urine
controls containing 0, 25, 37.5, 62.5, 75 and 100 ng/mL THC. Similar
performance was observed at the various sites. Composite results are shown
below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. The assay is intended for qualitative use.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Procedural controls are included in the test strip of the device. A line
appearing in the control region (C) is internal procedural control; it confirms
sufficient specimen volume was added to the device.
External control materials are not supplied with this test; however the labeling
includes a recommendation that external positive and negative controls be
tested to ensure proper kit performance. Users should follow local, state and
federal guidelines for testing QC material.
d. Detection limit:
See the Precision/Reproducibility Section (1a), above.
e. Analytical specificity:
The following structurally related compounds were serially diluted (1:1),
added to drug-free urine and observed to yield positive results at the
concentrations listed below.
Compound Concentration in ng/mL
11-nor-Δ -9-THC-9-COOH 50
11-hydroxy-Δ -9-THC 1,000
Δ-8-tetrahydrocannabinol 5,000
Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol 5,000
Cannabinol 10,000
Cannabidiol >100,000
The compounds shown below were added to a pool of urine samples
containing THC at 25 ng/mL, and 100 ng/mL. At concentrations of 100
ug/mL the substances listed below did not alter the expected results.
Acetaminophen Acetone Hemoglobin

f. Assay cut-off:
The identified cutoff concentration for marijuana metabolites (50 ng/mL) is
the one recommended by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA). Analytical performance of the device around the
cutoff is described in Section 1.a., above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Negative specimens: 70 urine specimens were donated by sixty self-declared
non-drug users and were determined negative by testing with the predicate
device. In addition, 60 urine specimens, pre-screened by GC/MS for THC,
were evaluated. Results are shown below.
