L. Test Principle:
The Emit 2000 Cyclosporine Specific Assay is based on the competition
immunoassay principle. Cyclosporine in the sample competes with cyclosporine in
Enzyme Reagent B that is labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PDH). Active (unbound) enzyme converts the oxidized
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in Antibody Reagent A to NADH,
resulting in a kinetic absorbance change that can be measured spectrophotometrically.
Enzyme activity decreases upon binding the antibody, allowing the cyclosporine
concentration in the sample to be measured in terms of enzyme activity.
The assay requires the use of whole blood. Samples, calibrators, and controls must
first be pretreated with the Emit Cyclosporine Pretreatment Reagent. The reagent
lyses the cells, extracts the cyclosporine, and precipitates most of the blood proteins.
The pretreated samples are then centrifuged and an aliquot of the resulting
supernatant containing the cyclosporine can be assayed using the Emit 2000
Cyclosporine Specific Assay.
The assay may either be run to measure cyclosporine concentrations from 40-500
ng/mL or as the extended range application from 350-2000 ng/mL. Separate
calibrators are required for each application.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP5-A (formerly
NCCLS). Whole blood pools at three different levels were prepared by spiking
cyclosporine into EDTA whole blood, resulting in samples ~400 ng/mL(Level 1),
~900 ng/mL (Level 2), and ~1400 ng/mL (Level 3). The study was conducted for
20 days, with 2 runs per day with samples run in duplicate. For the duplicate
measurements, the sample was first pretreated as per the Instructions for Use, and
then split for each replicate measurement.
Within run imprecision ranged from 3.3-4.8% c.v. and total imprecision ranged
from 5.9-8.7%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was performed according to CLSI EP6-P. Cyclosporine-free EDTA
whole blood was spiked with cyclosporine at concentrations covering the
extended application range (250, 350, 500, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500, 1750, and
2000 ng/mL). Four separate runs of each level were pretreated and assayed five
times (n=20 at each concentration) on the V-Twin analyzer.

--- Page 5 ---
The data was analyzed by linear regression and yielded a slope of 1.02, intercept
3.80 and r2 0.996. The data supports the assay range of 350-2000 ng/mL.
The accuracy of diluting samples with high cyclosporine concentration was
evaluated by spiking five patient samples with cyclosporine (2000-2400 ng/mL),
and then diluting 1:2 and 1:4 with either cyclosporine-negative EDTA whole
blood or Emit 2000 Cyclosporine Specific Calibrator 0. The diluted samples were
pretreated and then assayed on the V-Twin analyzer. The result for each diluted
sample was compared to the nominal concentration of the spiked patient samples.
All diluted samples quantitated within the established acceptance criteria of 90-
110% compared to the reference.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The shelf-life of the assay was previously established for the PMA submission
P920031. No changes were made to the reagents for the extended range claim.
Calibrators were reviewed under k053108.
d. Detection limit:
In order to describe the functional sensitivity, whole blood pools and control
samples with values near the lower end of the measuring range were tested over a
20 day period. The functional sensitivity of the assay is considered to be
concentration at which the inter-assay coefficient of variation is ≤20%. For this
assay, a whole blood pool with a mean value of ~360 ng/mL had a %CV of 10.2
demonstrating a functional sensitivity of <350 ng/mL
e. Analytical specificity:
The effects of major cyclosporine metabolites, potential endogenous interferents,
and co-administered common or immunosuppressive drugs on assay performance
were evaluated.
In order to assess cross-reactivity of cyclosporine metabolites, 1000 ng/mL of
each metabolite (AM1, AM4n, AM9, AM19, AM1c, AM1c9, AM4c9) were
spiked into whole blood samples containing 800 ng/mL of cyclosporine. AM1c9
was also tested at 800 ng/mL. The reference was the same sample without
metabolite. The cross-reactivity of the metabolites ranged from -5.9% to 5.5%
and met the manufacturer’s specification of values within ±10% of the reference
sample.
The effects of bilirubin (60 mg/dL), cholesterol (500 mg/dL), uric acid (20
mg/dL), albumin (12 g/dL), IgG (12 g/dL), triglycerides (1500 mg/dL),
rheumatoid factor (500 IU/ml), hematocrit (66.5%), and HAMA were evaluated.
A sample containing the interferent was spiked with 800 ng/mL cyclosporine and
compared to the same sample with cyclosporine alone. Interference is considered
to be any sample that shows greater than 10% bias. The endogenous compounds
tested did not interfere with the cyclosporine assay.

--- Page 6 ---
Commonly co-administered drugs, including immunosuppressive drugs, were
evaluated for interference. Samples were prepared by adding each drug to a
whole blood sample containing 800 ng/mL cyclosporine. The control was the
sample without the added drug. Sixty drugs that were tested and the list can be
found in the package insert under Specificity section. Interference was defined as
values greater than ±10% of the control sample. Each drug tested did not
interfere with the cyclosporine assay at the level described for each drug.

Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Studies for the extended range application were conducted at two hospitals:
Methodist Medical Center of Illinois (MMCI) and University of Maryland
Medical Center (UMMC). A total of 138 banked retrospective samples from
heart, liver, or kidney transplant patients on cyclosporine therapy were included in
the study. Samples from both male and female patients, with varying ranges of
time post-transplant, and varying ranges of time of blood draw with respect to
drug administration were collected. Samples were distributed across most of the
assay range however supplemental samples from kidney transplant patients were
included to cover the range from 1500-2000 ng/mL. Whole blood EDTA samples
were kept frozen until testing. At each site samples were tested using the EMIT
2000 Cyclosporine extended range application on the V-Twin analyzer, on the
Abbott TDx/TDxFLx Cyclosporine Monoclonal Whole Blood assay, and on
LC/MS following established protocols.
Results are presented in the following summary table and regression graphs. All
three organ types and both clinical sites are included.
