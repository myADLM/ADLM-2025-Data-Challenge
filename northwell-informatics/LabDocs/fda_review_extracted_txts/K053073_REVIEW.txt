K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None provided.
L. Test Principle:
Proteins contained in human body fluids form immunochemical reaction with specific
antibodies. These complexes scatter a beam of flight passed through the sample. The
intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the relevant
protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of
known concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision Study
The N Antisera to Human α -Macroglobulin assay was used to measure
2
α -Macroglobulin concentrations ranging from 1.06 to 5.13 g/L in N/T Protein
2
Control SL-L/M/H, a low serum pool, and a high serum pool. Four
determinations per day over 10 days (n=40) were performed using a BN™
System. A summary of the precision data is presented in the Table below.

e. Analytical specificity:
Potentially interfering endogenous substances
Interference testing was performed to determine the effect of icterus, lipemia,
and hemolysis, on the N Antisera to Human α -Macroglobulin assay. Normal
2
serum samples preparations (1.70-2.06 g/L) were spiked with increased
concentrations of bilirubin, hemoglobin, and triglycerides. For each spiked
sample, the % recovery was determined [% Recovery = (Test result/Baseline)
x 100]. The acceptance criterion was ±20 relative deviation from the base
pool. No interference was seen up to: 0.6 g/L bilirubin, 10 g/L hemoglobin,
and 5.7 g/L triglycerides.
Normal serum samples (1.41-2.21 g/L) were compared to sera spiked with 5%
of lithium, sodium, or ammonium heparin to determine potential interference
by heparin anticoagulants for plasma samples. No interference was seen.
Percent deviation between the mean recoveries of
Lithium/Sodium/Ammonium Heparin was ± 7%. (Lithium vs. Sodium: -
2.81%, Lithium vs. Ammonium: -6.13% and Ammonium vs. Sodium: 4.21%)
f. Assay cut-off:
No change.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:
Fresh and frozen serum and heparinized plasma samples covering the
reportable range (1:20 dilutions, α -Macroglobulin: 0.2-6.4 g/L) were
2
compared to determine if any significant bias between matrices. The heparin
samples were a mixture of heparin types, however since the percent deviation
between the heparin types was low, this was acceptable.
