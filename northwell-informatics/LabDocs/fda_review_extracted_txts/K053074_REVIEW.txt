K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None
L. Test Principle:
Proteins contained in human body fluids form immunochemical reaction with specific
antibodies. These complexes scatter a beam o flight passed through the sample. The
intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the relevant
protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of
known concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
No change.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
No change.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference by endogenous substances:
Ceruloplasmin: Normal serum samples (0.175-0.43 g/L) were spiked with
increasing concentrations of bilirubin, hemoglobin, and triglycerides. The
percent recovery was determined for each sample relative to a reference
sample (± 20%). No interference was seen up to: 0.6 g/L bilirubin, 10 g/L
hemoglobin, and 2.4 g/L triglycerides. Normal serum samples (0.258-0.466
g/L) were compared to sera spiked with 5% of lithium, sodium, or ammonium
heparin to determine potential interference by heparin anticoagulants for
plasma samples. No interference was seen. Percent deviation (± 7%) between
the mean recoveries of the heparin types was (-)0.305 to (+)0.386%.
Hemopexin: No data was provided for interference from bilirubin,
hemoglobin, or triglycerides. Normal serum samples (0.82-1.22 g/L) were
compared to sera spiked with 5% of lithium, sodium, or ammonium heparin to
determine potential interference by heparin anticoagulants for plasma
samples. No interference was seen. Percent deviation (± 7%) between the
mean recoveries of the heparin types was (-)2.301 to (-)0.907%.
f. Assay cut-off:
No change.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison: Fresh and frozen serum and heparinized plasma samples
covering the reportable range (1:20 dilutions, Ceruloplasmin: 0.07-2.2 g/L;
Hemopexin: 0.2-6.4 g/L) were compared to determine if any significant bias
between matrices. The heparin samples were a mixture of heparin types,
however since the percent deviation between the heparin types (see
Interference studies above) was low, this was deemed acceptable.
