DAD, Haptoglobin, antigen, antiserum, control
4. Panel:
Immunology 82
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
In vitro diagnostic reagents for the quantitative determination of transferrin and
haptoglobin in human serum, heparinized and EDTA plasma, as well as
transferrin in human urine by means of immunonephelometry on the BN™
systems.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None
L. Test Principle:
Proteins contained in human body fluids form immunochemical reaction with specific
antibodies. These complexes scatter a beam o flight passed through the sample. The
intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the relevant
protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of
known concentration.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
No change.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
No change.
d. Detection limit:
No change.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference by endogenous substances
Transferrin: Normal serum samples (2.14-3.17 g/L) were spiked with
increasing concentrations of bilirubin, hemoglobin, and triglycerides. The
percent recovery was determined for each sample relative to a reference
sample (± 20%). No interference was seen up to: 0.6 g/L bilirubin, 8.2 g/L
triglycerides and 10 g/L hemoglobin. Normal serum samples (2.17-2.94 g/L)
were compared to sera spiked with 5% of lithium, sodium, or ammonium
heparin to determine potential interference by heparin anticoagulants for
plasma samples. No interference was seen. Percent deviation (± 7%) between
the mean recoveries of the heparin types was (-)1.06 to (+)0.528%.
Haptoglobin: No data was provided for interference from bilirubin,
hemoglobin, or triglycerides. Normal serum samples (0.6-2.11 g/L) were
compared to sera spiked with 5% of lithium, sodium, or ammonium heparin to
determine potential interference by heparin anticoagulants for plasma
samples. No interference was seen. Percent deviation (± 7%) between the
mean recoveries of the heparin types was (-)1.59 to (+)0.403%.
f. Assay cut-off:
No change.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:
Fresh and/or frozen serum and plasma samples, covering the reportable range
(1:20 dilutions, Transferrin: 0.35-5.6 g/L; Haptoglobin: 0.26-8.3 g/L) were
compared to determine if any significant bias existed between matrices. The
heparin samples were a mixture of heparin types, however since the percent
deviation between the heparin types (see Interference studies above) was low,
this was deemed acceptable.
