ISO 15197: Requirements for blood-glucose monitoring systems for self-testing in managing
diabetes mellitus
L. Test Principle:
The test is based on the release of electrical potential after a two-step reaction where glucose
and ferricyanide, in the presence of glucose oxidase, are converted into gluconolactone and
ferrocyanide. Ferrocyanide, when electrical current is applied, becomes ferricyanide and
releases electrons; the increase in current measured by the meter is proportional to the
glucose concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The company followed ISO 15197 in quantifying the precision of their glucose system.
The company made measurements on pooled venous blood spiked to 5 different glucose
concentrations on 10 different meters using strips from 10 different vials taken from one
manufacturing lot for a total of 100 measurements per glucose concentration, 500
measurements per manufacturing lot. The company repeated this procedure on 3
different production lots for a total of 1500 measurements. Five values were excluded
when the meter produced no result because of technician error.

The company used accelerated aging further substantiated by comparison to the
storage behavior of their predicate device to determine the shelf life of their device.
Three manufacturing lots of meter strips were stored at 45°C, 50°C, 60°C, and 70°C.
Sets of 36 strips were periodically withdrawn from environmental storage and used
for measurements. For each time point, the company made 6 replicate measurements
at 6 different glucose concentrations spanning the claimed range of their device. The
company used a 20% change in behavior as a criterion for determining when a strip
was over-aged.
From their accelerated aging studies, the company concluded that the shelf life of
their measurement strips was at least 36 months when stored at 30 °C. The company
noted that the a comparative aging study of the new and predicate measurement strips
indicated the proposed device demonstrated a factor of 3 greater shelf life when
compared to the predicate. The predicate device has a shelf life of 21 months as
confirmed by real-time studies.
The data supplied by the company supports the room temperature shelf life of 21
months claimed for the proposed device.
Control solutions for this device were cleared previously in the predicate.
d. Detection limit:
The company demonstrated the performance of their device near their high glucose
limit using 2 test suites. Below the 600 mg/dL limit for the device, the company
performed measurements on glucose enriched venous blood with glucose ranging
from 573 mg/dL to 580 mg/dL as determined by a plasma YSI measurement. 88.8%
of the measurements fell within 10% of the plasma YSI reference. 100% of the
measurements fell within 20% of the plasma YSI reference. There were no non-
numeric “HI” results.
The company challenged 8 meters with venous blood enriched to a glucose
concentration of 698 mg/dL as determined by a YSI. All meters reported a “HI”
reading instead of a numeric value.
The company validated the performance of their device at their low glucose limit
using 2 test suites. In the first, the company challenged the performance of 8
production meters and 1 lot of strips using venous blood depleted to a glucose
concentration of 6 mg/dL as determined by a plasma YSI reading. All meters
reported a “LO” concentration.
The company further validated the performance of their device at low glucose
concentrations using a meter whose software reporting limit was disabled for the test.
The company made 32 measurements distributed evenly over 4 lots of strips with
venous blood adjusted to a glucose of 21.7 mg/dL as determined by a YSI. They
made an additional 8 measurements using an additional lot of strips (5 lots total)
6

--- Page 7 ---
using blood adjusted to a glucose concentration of 23.4 mg/dL. Of these 40
measurements, one point or 2.5% fell outside the ± 15 mg/dL range specified by ISO
15197. 11 of 40 measurements or 27.5% would have yielded numerical results to the
user. All 11 of these numeric results were within IS 15197 limits.
The data provided by the company substantiates their claims for performance at the
lower and upper limit, 20 mg/dL and 600 mg/dL respectively, and the measuring
range of their device.
e. Analytical specificity:
Impact of Chemical Interference
The company assessed the impact of endogenous and exogenous chemicals on the
performance of their device. The company followed CLSI EP07-A2 “Interference
Testing in Clinical Chemistry” in assessing the impact of analytes on their device.
The company used 3 lots of strips to measure the impact of added analytes at 2
different glucose concentrations: 70 mg/dL and 240 mg/dL. Chemicals tested for
interference were added by spiking. The company used ISO 15197 guidelines as a
limit for assessing interference. Additives that altered the devices response by more
than 15 mg/dL for the 70 mg/dL solution or by more than 20% (48 mg/dL) for the
240 mg/dL were found to interfere.

The company opted to limit their claimed temperature range to 15 – 35 °C.
The data supplied by the company supports the claimed operating temperature range for
this device.
Impact of Hematocrit
The company used fresh venous blood from non-diabetic volunteers to assess the impact
of variations in hematocrit on the device. Concentrations of glucose were adjusted by
spiking. Hematocrit levels were adjusted across the 30-55% range via centrifugation and
re-suspension of the packed cells. Measurements were made on 7 different meters and
across 4 lots of strips.
Using a total of 238 measurements, the company determined that in a glucose range of 74
– 121 mg/dL, variations in hematocrit introduced a linear change in their device’s
response that could be described by a line: Bias = -1.52 (%Hematocrit) +65.7. This met
the company’s acceptance criteria of bias less than ±20% across the claimed range for the
device, 30%-55% hematocrit.
Using a total of 259 measurements, the company determined that in a glucose range of
411 – 466 mg/dL, variations in hematocrit introduced a linear change in their device’s
response: Bias = -1.27 (%Hematocrit) + 55.0. This met the company’s acceptance
criteria of bias less than ±20% across the claimed range for the device, 30%-55%

1. Modes of Operation:
Test strips can only be used once. Users must replace the strip before taking an
additional reading.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___Y____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended for use with fresh capillary whole blood. Since the sample is
applied directly to the test strip, there are no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
Each bottle of test strips is accompanied by an electronic key which contains information
necessary to customize the performance of the meter to each lot of strips. The user
changes the key on opening a new vial of test strips. The user has the option of
comparing the code number for the key against the code number printed on the vial either
through the user interface of the meter or by comparing the number printed on the key.
No further calibration is required of the user.
6. Quality Control:
The company provides two levels of glucose control solutions with this device. To
perform a test on a control solution, the user first inserts a test strip into the meter’s
receptacle for strips. After confirming that the displayed numeric code matches the code
for the key printed on the strip vial, the user presses the navigation keys until they enter

the control solution mode. This mode prevents the meter from automatically storing the
results of the measurement of the control. The user then measures the glucose
concentration of the control solution as described in the user manual. The user compares
the output of this measurement to the acceptable range of measurements for each control
level printed on the label of the test strip vial. If control results fall outside these ranges,
the user is referred to a list of troubleshooting steps and the customer care line.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
The meter supports memory for storing 250 measurements. Once stored in memory,
measurement values are independent of the calibration key currently loaded in the meter.
When the memory of the device is full, additional measurements automatically overwrite the
oldest stored reading. Saved results are stored with the date of the measurement and a
number, e.g. 1,2,3 … , indicating the “nth” measurement of the day. In addition, the meter
supports a 7, 14, and 30 day moving average calculation for glucose concentrations. The
device provides audible alarms to alert the user to low glucose measurements and to remind
users to monitor their glucose.
Information on software and device testing provided by the company support their
performance claims for this feature.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports substantial
equivalence decision.
