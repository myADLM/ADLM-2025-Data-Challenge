L. Test Principle:
The Dri-STAT® Enzymatic Bilirubin Reagent employs an enzymatic method, in
which bilirubin oxidase catalyses the oxidation of bilirubin and produces a loss in the
characteristic yellow absorption band. In the assay medium provided, total bilirubin is
determined by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 479 nm and 520 nm. The total
absorption change is proportional to the concentration of bilirubin in the sample.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Imprecision was assessed by three control samples and one serum pool.
Four randomized runs were performed five times over twenty days. Each
run contained two replicates. Acceptance criteria is a SD of <0.15 for the
within run and a SD <0.225 for the total imprecision. The results are
presented in the table below:
Sample Number Mean SD (mg/dL) %CV
(mg/dL)
Within-Run Imprecision
Serum Control 1 80 0.7 0.03 4.8
Serum Control 2 80 4.0 0.05 1.1
Serum Control 3 80 7.3 0.08 1.1
Human Pool 80 19.7 0.12 0.6
Total Imprecision
Serum Control 1 80 0.7 0.03 4.8
Serum Control 2 80 4.0 0.06 1.4
Serum Control 3 80 7.3 0.11 1.5
Human Pool 80 19.7 0.47 2.4
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the bilirubin measurement was demonstrated by taking a
pooled serum sample and splitting into two samples. One sample is spiked
with purified bilirubin to a concentration of 25 mg/dL. The two samples were
inter-diluted to make a total of seven levels spanning the range of the assay 0-
25 mg/dL. Each sample was tested in triplicate and the average recovery was
calculated and plotted against the targeted recoveries. Linear regression of
comparison data yielded the following relationship:
y = 1.002x – 0.007, r = 1
The reportable range for bilirubin measurements is 0.2-25 mg/dL

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrators were previously cleared under k791141. The traceability
process is based on prEN ISO 17511.
The configuration and formulation of the bilirubin reagent is the same as the
predicate, therefore the shelf life stability of the assay was determined in the
predicate submission k843174 and not repeated for this submission.
On-board stability was determined by calibrating the instrument and running
controls solutions. The controls were periodically run over 18 days and the
values were compared to the original values. Acceptance criterion is + 1.3
times the within run Imprecision SD (0.15 mg/dL) or CV% (3%). On-board
stability demonstrated acceptable stability of 14-days.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity of the assay was evaluated by testing 20 replicates of
saline (zero) and a patient sample diluted (with saline) to achieve a
concentration less than the claimed sensitivity. Assay sensitivity is
distinguishable with 95% confidence + 2 SD. The analytical sensitivity of the
assay is 0.2 mg/dL.
The functional sensitivity is defined as the lowest bilirubin concentration
determined at a CV of less than 20%. The functional sensitivity was
determined to be 0.2 mg/dL
e. Analytical specificity:
Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could
interfere with the method. A substance was considered to show no significant
interference if the test sample was within 0.3 mg/dL or 6% of the control
specimen recovery. A summary of the data for know interferents appears for
the common interferents in the table below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical correlation studies were performed comparing the Dri-STAT
Enzymatic Bilirubin reagent results on the Synchron LX and CX systems
against the results from the Cobas Fara using serum samples. The correlations
are as follows:
LX Platform – y = 1.031x + 0.016, r = 0.9997, n = 70
CX Platform – y = 1.004x + 0.004, r = 0.9997, n = 70
b. Matrix comparison:
A serum and plasma comparison study was conducted to substantiate the use
of EDTA anticoagulant for bilirubin testing. Paired samples were analyzed by
the assay on the Synchron Systems. The correlation was as follows:
y = 0.952x – 0.038, r = 0.999, n=58

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The following reference range was obtained from the literature and verified by
drawing blood from 20 apparently non-smoking healthy adults. All samples were
run in duplicate. The acceptance criteria required at least 90 % of the samples to
have bilirubin values within the cited reference interval. The reference range was
determined to be 0.3 – 1.2 mg.dL.
