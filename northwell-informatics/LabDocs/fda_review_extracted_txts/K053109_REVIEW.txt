The Dimension® CardioPhase® high sensitivity C-reactive protein method for
the Dimension® clinical chemistry system with the heterogeneous immunoassay
module is an in vitro diagnostic test intended to quantitatively measure C-reactive
protein levels in human serum and heparinized plasma.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Dimension® CardioPhase® high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CCRP)
method for the Dimension® clinical chemistry system with the heterogeneous
immunoassay module is an in vitro diagnostic test intended to quantitatively
measure C-reactive protein levels in human serum and heparinized plasma.
In acute phase response, increased levels of a number of plasma proteins,
including Creactive protein, is observed. Measurement of CRP is useful for the
detection and evaluation of infection, tissue injury, inflammatory disorders and
associated diseases. High sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) measurements may be used as
an independent risk marker for the identification of individuals at risk for future
cardiovascular disease. Measurements of hsCRP, when used in conjunction with
traditional clinical laboratory evaluation of acute coronary syndromes, may be
useful as an independent marker of prognosis for recurrent events, in patients with
stable coronary disease or acute coronary syndromes.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription
4. Special instrument requirements:
The Dimension® CardioPhase® high sensitivity C-reactive protein method
requires one of the following instruments: the Dade Behring Dimension® RxL
clinical chemistry system (K944093), the Dade Behring Dimension® RxL Max
clinical chemistry system (K 944093), the Dade Behring Dimension® Xpand
clinical chemistry system (K010061) or the Dade Behring Dimension® Xpand
PLUS clinical chemistry system (K010061). All require the heterogeneous
module.
I. Device Description:
The Dimension® CardioPhase® high sensitivity CRP Flex® reagent cartridge
(CCRP- RF434) is an in vitro diagnostic device that consists of prepackaged reagents
in a plastic eight well cartridge for use on the Dade Behring Dimension® clinical
chemistry system for the quantitative determination of C-reactive protein in human
serum and plasma.

L. Test Principle:
The CCRP method is a one step enzyme immunoassay based on the “sandwich”
principle. Sample is incubated with chromium dioxide particles and a ß-galactosidase
conjugate reagent; each coated with a monoclonal antibody specific for the C-reactive
protein molecule. A chrome particle/C-reactive protein/conjugate sandwich forms
during the incubation period. Unbound conjugate is removed by magnetic separation
and washing. After separation and washing, the particle/ C-reactive protein /conjugate
sandwich is transferred to the cuvette where the sandwich bound ß-galactosidase is
combined with the chromogenic substrate o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside
(ONPG). ß-galactosidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of ONPG to o-nitrophenol (ONP).

The change in absorbance due to the formation of ONP is directly proportional to the
concentration of C-reactive protein present in the patient sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing was done in accordance with the CLSI/NCCLS (EP5-
A2) Approved Guideline for Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical
Chemistry Devices. Commercial controls and human serum and plasma pools
were analyzed in duplicate, once a day, for 20 days. The within-run
(repeatability) and total (within-lab) standard deviations were calculated by
analysis of variance (ANOVA) method. Commercially available Bio-Rad
Liquichek® Lipid Controls were used. Human serum and plasma pools
prepared and aliquoted by Dade Behring Inc. were used.
Reproducibility
Standard Deviation (%CV)
Material mg/L Repeatability Within-Lab
Serum pool 1 3.07 0.05 (1.5) 0.07 (2.4)
Serum pool 2 10.83 0.14 (1.3) 0.18 (1.7)
Plasma pool 1 11.15 0.18 (1.7) 0.21 (1.9)
Control1 0.84 0.02 (2.9) 0.05 (5.6)
Control 2 4.40 0.07 (1.6) 0.11 (2.4)
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by testing mixtures of a high
and low sample. Observed CRP values were plotted vs expected CRP values.
A linear regression analysis was performed on the data and plotted. The
observed linearity across the reportable range has a correlation coefficient of
0.997, slope of 0.989 and an intercept of -0.686. The Dimension® CCRP
assay is linear across the claimed assay range claim of 0.0 mg/L to 15.0 mg/L.
To test recovery, an experiment was performed using the following protocol.
Known amounts of CRP were added to human serum and plasma samples.
CCRP concentrations on these samples were then measured and the calculated
percent recovery ranged from 101% to 105%.
CRP results greater than 15 mg/L will generate an “Above Assay Range” test
result message. According to the CCRP Instructions for Use, readings in
excess of 15 mg/L may be repeated after diluting the sample with Purified
Water to produce a sample concentration within the assay range. The resulting
readout will then be multiplied by the dilution factor entered into the system
to give the concentration of the undiluted sample. The Dimension®

instrument also has the capability to “auto dilute” samples above the assay
range by re-sampling with a reduced sample volume (2 µL) resulting in a 1:6
dilution of the sample.
A parallelism experiment was performed to demonstrate the ability of the
method to show a consistent linear dilution profile between its calibrator and
test specimens.
The possibility of hook effect occurring when using the Dimension® CCRP
assay was evaluated with samples above the assay range that ranged from 400
to 2500 mg/L. See the attached document entitled "Hook Effect".
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended reference material for the Dimension® CCRP method is
the Dimension® CCRP Calibrator (Cat. No. RC434). The assigned values of
this product are standardized to the International Federation of Clinical
Chemistry (IFCC) International Reference Preparation for Plasma Proteins,
the Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) and the College of American
Pathologists (CAP). The basis of this international standardization is the
IFCC/BCR/CAP reference preparation for 14 human serum proteins (Lot No.
91/0619=CRM470=RPPHS 91/0619) (lot V).
Subject of k053104
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity of the Dimension® CCRP method is 0.10 mg/L .
The analytical sensitivity is defined as the mean value (n=20) plus two
standard deviations of the low level 1(0mg/L)CCRP Calibrator. The Lower
Limit of Quantification (LoQ) or functional sensitivity of the Dimension®
CCRP method is 0.17mg/L. The functional sensitivity represents the lowest
concentration with an observed 10% coefficient of variation.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed according to the CLSI/NCCLS Protocol
EP-7A. A summary of the substances that do not interfere with the
Dimension® CCRP method when present in serum at the concentrations
indicated can be found in the package insert. Inaccuracies (biases) due to these
substances are less than 10% at a CRP level equivalent to 3.0 mg/L/mL.
f. Assay cut-off:
The AHA/CDC Scientific Statement provides the following risk assessment
guidelines:

b. Matrix comparaison:
Serum vs. Plasma Comparison
Serum, lithium heparinized or sodium heparinized plasma are the recommended
specimens for the Dimension® CCRP assay. A split sample comparison was
performed at Glasgow Research Laboratory. Fifity-five samples were drawn and
run randomly on the Dimension® RxL clinical chemistry system.
Matched specimens of serum and heparinized plasma were drawn from volunteers
and processed by the CCRP method on the Dimension®. Linear regression
analysis showed excellent agreement between serum, lithium heparin plasma and
sodium heparin plasma specimens.

Expected values for healthy individuals as noted in the literature are typically ≤3
mg/L. As CRP is a nonspecific indicator for a wide range of disease processes,
and as the reference intervals are affected by many factors that may differ for each
population studied, each laboratory should determine its own reference interval
for CCRP as performed on the Dimension® clinical chemistry system.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
