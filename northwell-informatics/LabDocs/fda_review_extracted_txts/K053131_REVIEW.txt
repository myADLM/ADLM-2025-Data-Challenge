L. Test Principle:
The Wako Total Bilirubin V uses an enzymatic method for bilirubin detection. Total
bilirubin reacts with vanadate under acidic conditions, and is oxidized to biliverdin.
The resulting absorbance change is colorimetrically measured at 451 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All studies were conducted on the ADVIA 1650 analyzer unless stated otherwise.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision was conducted with Wako Total Bilirubin V with 22
and/or 23 replicates of five sample concentrations.

Sample 4 22 20.06 0.13 0.63
Sample 5 22 36.84 0.26 0.71
Total precision was conducted on two levels of pooled sera, in the abnormal
and normal ranges. Samples were run in duplicate for 20 days.

An accuracy of recovery study was conducted with the Wako Total Bilirubin V
by running dilutions of pooled serum with saline or calibrators in replicates of 5.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A dilution linearity study was conducted and the sponsor claims a reportable
range of 0.1 to 40 mg/dL. When total bilirubin concentration exceeds 40
mg/dL, a 1:1 sample dilution with saline is required and the result is
multiplied by 2. Seventy two plasma and serum pairs that ranged from 0.46
to 38.99 mg/dL were analyzed and the linear regression equation was reported
as y=0.981x + 0.044 and r=0.999.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Wako Total Bilirubin is stable when stored at 2 to 35° C until its
expiration date.
d. Detection limit:
The minimum level of detection is 0.1 mg/dL and was calculated by running a
known zero sample (water) for 21 replicates. The mean plus 2 SD was used to
calculate the minimum level of detection of 0.1 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
No interference was observed by ascorbic acid up to 50 mg/dL, hemoglobin
up to 500 mg/dL and intrafat up to 2%. Anticoagulants were also studied and
no interference was detected with EDTA, citrate, oxalate, sodium flouride and

f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The Wako Total Bilirubin V was compared to the Wako Total Bilirubin V that
was previously cleared in 1997. A comparison of bilirubin measurements by
the current device (y) and the predicate device (x) was performed using 89
serum samples. The equation of y= 0.990x + 0.005 with an r=0.999 was
obtained with using the ADVIA 1650 instrument.
b. Matrix comparison:
A comparison of 36 matched serum and plasma samples (31 patient samples
and 5 spiked samples run in duplicate) that ranged from 0.46 to 38.99 mg/dL
was performed. Of the 36 matched serum and plasma samples, 5 were spiked
with a concentrated form of human bilirubin calibrator to evaluate the
comparison at the high end of the linear range. The 31 patient samples were
drawn fresh daily and run in duplicates for 7 days. The comparison was
preformed on the ADVIA 1650 analyzer and gave the following equation:
y=0.981x + 0.43 and r=0.99.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:

--- Page 6 ---
The sponsor states that the expected value of total bilirubin in serum and plasma
is 0.2 to 1.0 mg/dL as recommended in Tietz Textbook of Clinical Chemistry by
Carl A. Burtis and Edward R. Ashwood.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
