L. Test Principle:
The Wako Direct Bilirubin V uses an enzymatic method for bilirubin detection.
Direct bilirubin reacts with vanadate under acidic conditions, and is oxidized to
biliverdin. The resulting absorbance change is colorimetrically measured at 451 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All studies were conducted on the ADVIA 1650 analyzer unless stated otherwise.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision was conducted with Wako Direct Bilirubin V with 22 or
23 replicates of five sample concentrations.

Sample 4 22 9.9 0.07 0.73
Sample 5 22 19.9 0.16 0.83
Total precision was conducted on two levels of pooled sera, in the abnormal
and normal ranges. Samples were run in duplicate for 20 days.

An accuracy study was conducted with the Wako Direct Bilirubin V by running 6
human serum samples in replicates of 5.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A dilution linearity study was conducted and the sponsor claims a linear range
of 0.1 to 20 mg/dL. The labeling informs user that if the direct bilirubin
concentration exceeds 20 mg/dL, a 1:1 sample dilution with saline is required
and the result is multiplied by 2. Seventy two plasma and serum pairs that
ranged from 0.07 to 22.17 mg/dL were analyzed and the linear regression
equation was reported as y=0.985x + 0.055 and r=0.999.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Wako Direct Bilirubin is stable when stored at 2 to 10° C until its
expiration date.
d. Detection limit:
The minimum level of detection is 0.1 mg/dL and was calculated by running a
known zero sample (water) for 21 replicates. The mean plus 2 SD was used to
calculate the minimum level of detection of 0.1 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
No interference was observed by ascorbic acid up to 50 mg/dL, hemoglobin
up to 500 mg/dL and Intrafat up to 2%. Anticoagulants were also studied and
no interference was detected with EDTA, citrate, oxalate, sodium flouride and
heparin.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The Wako Direct Bilirubin V was compared to the Wako 30R Bilirubin V that
was previously cleared in 1991. A comparison of bilirubin measurements by
the current device (y) and the predicate device (x) was performed using 84
serum samples. The equation of y= 0.971x + 0.020 with a r=0.912 was
obtained with using the Hitachi 911.
b. Matrix comparison:
A comparison of 36 matched serum and plasma samples (31 patient samples
and 5 spiked samples run in duplicate) that ranged from 0.07 to 22.2 mg/dL
was performed. Of the 36 matched serum and plasma samples, 5 were spiked
with a concentrated form of human bilirubin calibrator to evaluate the
comparison at the high end of the linear range. The 31 patient samples were
drawn fresh daily and run in duplicates for 7 days. The comparison was
preformed on the ADVIA 1650 analyzer and gave a correlation coefficient of
r=0.9989 and a regression equation of y = 0.985x +0.05.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor states that the expected value of direct bilirubin in serum and plasma
is 0.0 – 0.2 mg/dL as recommended in Tietz Textbook of Clinical Chemistry by
Carl A. Burtis and Edward R. Ashwood.
