H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The HemoCue Albumin is a quantitative rapid turbidimetric immunoassay of albumin in
human urine using a specially designed analyzer, the HemoCue Albumin 201 System.
The system is designed to be used for the quantitative determination of low levels of
albumin in urine at the point of care for the purpose of screening for, diagnosing,
monitoring and to supplement the clinical evidence in the treatment of microalbuminuria.
The system is designed for testing using spot samples or timed collections. A quantitative
result is obtained within 90 seconds. HemoCue Urine Albumin Microcuvettes are for in
vitro diagnostic use only. The HemoCue Albumin 201 Analyzer is only to be used with
the HemoCue Urine Albumin Microcuvettes.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
HemoCue Albumin 201 Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The HemoCue Albumin 201 Analyzer system consists of a small, portable analyzer, software
and plastic microcuvettes containing dried reagent (rabbit anti-human albumin antibody).
The HemoCue Albumin 201 Analyzer is factory calibrated against a turbidimetric method.
The main parts are the cuvette holder (brings the microcuvette in the correct measuring
position, vibrates the microcuvette to speed up the reaction), the optronic unit (performs a
measurement of turbidity in the microcuvette), a display, power adaptor and embedded
software.
The HemoCue Urine Albumin Microcuvette is made of polystyrene and contains a cavity
that holds approximately 18 μL of specimen. The cuvette cavity contains the following
reagents 11% w/w rabbit anti-human antibody (polyclonal), 355 w/w PEG, 18% w/w
Tris/HCL-buffer, 2% w/w polymer and 33% w/w non-reactive ingredients.

L. Test Principle:
The microcuvette contains dried reagents deposited on its inner walls. The urine sample is
drawn into the microcuvette cavity by capillary action. The cuvette contains a specific rabbit
anti-human albumin antibody (polyclonal) which forms an agglutinate with human albumin
in the sample. The agglutination is enhanced by polymers. Within 90 seconds, the
immunochemical reaction is completed and the turbidity is measured photometrically at 610
nm. The albumin concentration is proportional to the turbidity. When the end point is
reached, the result is displayed in mg/L.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The within-run and total precision for urine albumin was estimated using the
CLSI/NCCLS EP5-A method. The data represents samples run in duplicate, twice a
day over 20 days on five instruments. Two levels of urine albumin control (Albutrol),
low = 27 + 9 and normal = 79 + 23. The acceptance criterion is an SD <3 mg/L or CV
< 10% in the range 10-150 mg/L. The results are presented in the table below:
Within-run Total Precision
Control N Mean SD % CV SD % CV
Sample (mg/L) (mg/L) (mg/L)
1 400 27.9 2.41 8.6 2.58 9.2
2 400 81.8 3.20 3.9 3.48 4.3
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the albumin measurement was demonstrated by comparing ten
prepared urine samples on the HemoCue Albumin 201 System and a commercially
available method. The predicted difference between the first order of regression and

2	400	81.8	3.20	3.9	3.48	4.3

--- Page 5 ---
the best-fitting order shall be less than 10 mg/L for albumin concentrations <10 mg/L
and less than 15% for albumin concentrations 50-200 mg/L. The ten samples ranged
in concentration from 0-200 mg/L. The method is linear from 0-200 mg/L with non-
linearity less than 0.9 mg/L for albumin concentration 3.12 mg/L and less than 3.6%
for albumin concentrations 50-200 mg/L. The measuring range of the assay is 7-150
mg/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The HemoCue Albumin 201 System is factory calibrated against a turbidimetric
method with the calibration level traceable to the certified reference material CRM
470.
Shelf life Stability:
Three lots of the HemoCue Albumin cuvettes stored at 2-8 ºC, for the following time
periods, one lot stored for 6 months, one at 9 months and the last for 12 months were
used to assess stability. Artificial urine samples with the concentration 0, 25, 50 and
150 mg/L were assayed on each lot and each lot was assayed on five analyzers.
Acceptance criteria are that the analytical performance is + 20%, compared with the
theoretical value for the artificial urine sample. All three lots showed analytical
performance within the + 20%. Shelf life was determined to be 9 months from the
date of manufacture when stored at 2-8 ºC.
External control materials are recommended but not supplied.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of the blank of the assay was evaluated by testing 20 replicates of three
individual urine samples and 60 replicates of a urine pool prepared from ten
individual samples. Assay sensitivity is distinguishable with 95% confidence interval
was determined to be 7 mg/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Studies were performed to assess interference of different applicable chemical,
protein and pH values. A substance was considered to show no interference if the
results are within the clinical acceptable performance criteria + 15%. Two urine
samples at two different concentrations (25 and 75 mg/L) of albumin and two
different pH values (4.5 and 9.0) were used to test interference. The following
showed no interference at the concentrations tested:
