g. Cross-Contamination Testing
This study evaluated the potential for cross contamination / carryover of the
COBAS AMPLICOR™ CT/NG for N. gonorrhoeae assay with automated sample
preparation directed by the Roche Scripts; in comparison to manual sample
preparation. This test was designed to observe the effects of potential
aerosolization / splash over the entire A-ring. Positive specimens or M4 media
blanks were prepared as samples.
Positive samples were prepared from stock cultures of Chlamydia trachomatis
(ATCC strain Vr 885, Serovar D) at 1.44 x 107 IFU/mL and Neisseria
gonorrhoeae (ATCC 19242) at 1.0 x 108 IFU/mL diluted in M4 media. High
concentration of ~ 10,000 IFU/mL of C. trachomatis alone and ~10,000 IFU/mL
of both C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae combined were utilized. An
additional set of rings was prepared and run containing all blanks in the sample
positions. Data from rings containing all blanks were not included in the
calculations. Testing was performed on three instruments using 8 rings once a
day over five days. The overall false positive rate was 0.4% (1/270) with
automated specimen preparation and 0.8% (2/263) with manual preparation,
Seven blank samples returned an inhibitory result. The difference in the false
positivity rates are not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level,
and the results are equivalent.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
This method comparison study was designed to demonstrate the equivalency
between the automated specimen preparation technique directed by the Roche
Scripts and the manual specimen preparation method for 600 samples. The
acceptance criteria were based on a concordance of the initial test results;
inhibitory or equivocal results were not repeated.
The two methods should agree in their performance where at least 90% positive

O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Genesis RSP 150 Workstation is a multiple task liquid handling system that
combines a system of microprocessor-controlled liquid handling and other components to
one instrument. The User controls the system via a personal computer, equipped with the
Genesis Instrument Software, Gemini Software v4.2, and the Roche Scripts. Genesis
RSP is designed to handle liquid volumes ranging between 0.5 µL and 5 µL depending
on the installed configuration.
The liquid system is the central component of Genesis pipetting function. It transmits the
precise movement of the diluter pistons to the tips through the system liquid. The system
liquid is delivered to the system in a container and is aspirated and distributed in the
whole system via tubes, valves and connectors. The distribution of the system liquid is
effected by the movement of the diluter pistons in several strokes. Disposable tips with
filter shall be used where no carry over is tolerable.
2. Software:

Yes __X_ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
The Positive Identification (PosID2) reads Barcodes on Carriers, Racks and Containers
on both, the primary, e.g. sample tube, as well as the secondary side, e.g. microplates by
means of a scanner. With its gripper, it pulls carriers towards the rear of the instrument
for barcode identification on tubes and microplates, and then, pushes the carrier back into
operating position. To use the PosID2, all carriers, racks and containers (sample tubes,

microplates, reagent bottles, troughs) must be labeled with barcodes. Exact positioning
of these labels is required for optimal function.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
To minimize the potential for well-to-well carryover, the Roche Scripts direct the liquid
handling arms of the Tecan RSP 150 to discard the pipet tip immediately after any
pipetting step involving contact with a sample- or control containing well. Design
features intended to minimize the potential for cross-contamination via aerosolization and
splashing are listed below:
• Use of disposable pipet tips with aerosol barrier filters
• Low disposable tip eject option: tips are ejected into a narrow slit box to
reduce aerosolization during the ejection step
• Use of a deep well plate for extraction steps
The Gemini 4.2 software and the Tecan Genesis RSP 150 have liquid class settings which
control the accuracy of the aspiration and dispense functions of the liquid handling arm.
These liquid classes have several sub-options which are configured to the liquid being
handled. The sub-options include:
• LAG, STAG, TAG (air gap settings at specific places within the pipet tip)
• Rate / speed of aspiration and dispense settings
• Position of pipet tip in well to optimize liquid aspiration
• Mixing characteristics
5. Calibration:
Liquid class handling settings are determined for each liquid by performing volumetric
test cases. The documentation for the test cases is provided in the submission.
6. Quality Control:
An on-line interactive Troubleshooting guide normally detects problems and offers
immediate advice for corrective actions pertaining to operations, communication,
positioning, and identification errors. Daily, weekly, and periodic preventative
maintenance schedules are provided in the Tecan User Manual.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
The sponsor acknowledges that the analytical studies cited in the risk assessment as
controls for the Tecan functions are more properly identified as verification activities.
Roche audited Tecan, and confirmed that Tecan validated the Gemini v4.2 software.
The Roche Scripts CD’s are standalone software designed to run on Off-the-Shelf (OTS)
Tecan equipment. Roche Scripts are installed at the user site in read-only mode, and
cannot be altered by the User.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
