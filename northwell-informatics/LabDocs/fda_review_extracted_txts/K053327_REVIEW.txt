H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Please see indications for use.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Oxicom Control is intended to be used to monitor and evaluate the analytical
performance of the Waters Oxicom model 2000, 2100 and 3000 oxygen saturation
meters for the measurement of oxygen saturation. The use of quality control
materials is indicated as an objective assessment of the precision of methods and
techniques in use and is an integral part of good laboratory practice. The three
levels of oxygen saturation provided by the controls allow performance
monitoring with the clinically important range. For In Vitro diagnostic Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Prescription Use Only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Waters Oxicom oxygen saturation meters: models 2000, 2100, 3000.
I. Device Description:
The Oxicom Control is a liquid solution with dyes and polystyrene beads used to
mimic the absorbance of whole blood at a range of oxygen saturation levels. The
concentration of beads and dyes are designed to simulate the behavior of whole blood
at the wavelengths used by Waters Oxicom Systems. These liquid controls can be
handled as normal patient samples and can be incorporated into the clinical workflow.

L. Test Principle:
The product under submission is used to verify the performance of Oxicom analyzers.
The control is treated as a typical sample. Processing is done per instrument
instructions.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The performance of this control was verified by comparing it to the existing
Oxicom 2100 QC Filters used for quality control on the required Waters
Oxicom Systems instruments. Samples were run once a day for 30 days. The
results are presented in the table below.

The proposed device will serve as a quality control material for Waters
Oxicom oxygen saturation meters. The stability of the device is one of the
primary criteria for acceptance.
The company assessed the opened shelf life of the device through real-time
studies designed to mimic the behavior of device in the hands of the users.
The company evaluated the performance of open but capped material by
comparing measurements on this opened material to material that had not
been unsealed. Both the opened and unopened material were measured on 5
Oxicom instruments. Measurements were made weekly. All material
demonstrated significantly less that a 10% change in behavior, the
performance criteria set for the product. The data supplied by the company
supports the 2 month opened shelf life claimed by the company.
The company assessed the shelf life of the product through a series of
accelerated aging studies. The data supplied by the company supports the 3
year shelf life claimed by the company.

The company demonstrated their equivalence by direct comparison to the
existing Oxicom 2100 QC Filters on the required Waters Oxicom Systems
instruments.. Measurement comparisons were made across all 3 model lines
and on multiple instruments within in each product line. Samples were run
once a day for 30 days. The results are presented in the table below.
