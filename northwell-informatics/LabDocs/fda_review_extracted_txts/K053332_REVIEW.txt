510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
k041334
B. Purpose for Submission:
New Device for the US Market (This device has met the US Department of
Transportation requirements for breath alcohol devices)
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Sentech Korea Corp., AlcoScan AL-2500
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Quantitative (Oxide Semiconductor Alcohol Sensor)
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The AlcoScan AL-2500 is a self-contained unit with semiconductor-based gas
sensor, 3 digit LCD display, and power button. The 3 digit LCD display window
displays the alcohol concentration in increments of 0.01%. The display is also
capable of displaying “Wait”, “Low Battery”, “Calibration”, “Warn” states,
corresponding to warm up, low battery, calibration, and warn conditions,
respectively. If the alcohol concentration is greater than or equal to 0.05%, the
“WARN” light will be displayed on the unit. The unit is powered by two AA
batteries. An on/off power switch on the front of the unit toggles the unit on and
off.
2. Principles of Operation:
The sample is analyzed by a semiconductor-based gas sensor in order to calculate
Breath Alcohol Concentration (BrAC), which is then converted to an equivalent
Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC).
The STK3100 semiconductor sensor consists primarily of a sensing layer and
heating element, which is formed by an n-type semiconductor powder and heater,
respectively. When the heater is powered in clean air, oxygen molecules in the air
trap electrons in the semiconducting material after which they are chemically
absorbed on the surface of the powder particles. When the STK3100 is exposed
to ethanol vapor, the absorbed oxygen (O- or O -) reacts with the gas and is
2
reduced. By this reaction, the electrons trapped by the oxygen are released and
flow through the semiconductor, which means that resistance decreases and
electrical conductivity increases.
This method of operation was used in the predicate device (AlcoMate CA2000).

3. Modes of Operation:
Modes of operation include “Concentration”, “Wait”, “Low Battery”,
“Calibration”, “Warn” states, corresponding to warm up, reading the BAC
concentration, indicating low battery, calibration mode, and warning conditions,
respectively.
4. Specimen Identification:
BAC is calculated on a per-use basis.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The device takes a breath sample of at least (3) seconds in order to capture an
accurate “deep-lung air” sample.
6. Calibration:
Manufacturer recommends recalibration of the AlcoScan AL-2500 every six
months to one year to maintain accuracy. Calibration is performed by opening the
device and initiating the calibration mode, then blowing/spraying a prepared
0.04% BAC (0.40g/L BAC or 0.20mg/L BrAC over the sensor for 2 seconds. If
the device is to be calibrated by the user, the manufacturer strongly recommends
that a high quality breath alcohol tester such as police enforcement equipment or
better be used to ensure that an ethanol solution is the proper concentration, when
prepared by the consumer.
7. Quality Control (QC):
In order to ensure that the device functions properly, the manufacturer instructs
the user to:
a. Wait at least 20 minutes after eating or drinking before testing.
b. Avoid testing in high wind or enclosed spaces.
c. Do not blow smoke, saliva, or other contaminants into the mouthpiece.
d. Keep out of extreme temperatures.
e. Recommendation of professional recalibration of the device every six months
to one year.
8. Software:
The sensor contained in the AL-2500 detects alcohol by associating specific
voltage ranges to corresponding levels of alcohol. The data is passed as a simple
analog signal to an embedded CPU which converts the signal to a digital signal.
This digital reading is displayed by the LCD module as a BAC index (in %). All
processing is done by the embedded CPU.

J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
The precision and accuracy of this device has previously been demonstrated
through testing required by the US Department of Transportation. For
precision and accuracy, these requirements (referred to as Model
Specifications) consist of 20 trials at a Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of
0.008, 20 trials at a BAC of 0.032, and 20 trials at a BAC of 0.000. Blood
Alcohol Concentrations are simulated in breath by a Breath Alcohol Sample
Simulator (BASS), which provides an alcohol-in-air test sample with known
alcohol concentrations, flow rate, and air composition. The acceptance
criteria for the Model Specifications are: not more than one negative result at
0.032 BAC, not more than one positive result at 0.008 BAC, and not more
than one negative greater than zero and no positives at 0.000 BAC. NOTE:
for the purposes of this study, a BAC of 0.020 is used to distinguish a positive
from a negative result. The AL-2500 device had no negatives at 0.032 BAC,
no positives at 0.008 BAC, and no positives or non-zero negatives at 0.000
BAC.
b. Precision/Reproducibility:
See section a. above.
c. Linearity:
This device will report concentrations from 0.00 to 0.40%. However, DOT
Model Specifications require accuracy and precision testing at concentrations
of 0.008 and 0.032 only; therefore true linearity was not evaluated. This
device demonstrated acceptable performance according to the DOT Model
Specifications as described above.
d. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
This device uses an algorithm to convert deep lung breath alcohol
concentration to blood alcohol concentration.

--- Page 5 ---
e. Detection limit:
The DOT Model Specifications do not specifically address the detection limit
of breath alcohol devices. However, the devices must be tested at a BAC of
zero (blank reading) to assess the possibility of false positives. This consists
of 20 trials under normal laboratory conditions using fluorescent light at a
BAC of 0.000. Non-alcoholic human breath is to be used as the sample. For
devices capable of providing a reading of greater than 0.000 BAC and less
than 0.020 BAC, the acceptance criteria is as follows: not more than one such
result. The AL-2500 device had no false positives in this trial.
f. Interfering Substances:
The DOT Model Specifications require testing with cigarette smoke to assess
any possible interference. Five trials are required at 0.000 BAC. An
alcohol-free individual who smokes cigarettes is appropriate for this trial. The
subject is asked to smoke approximately one half of a cigarette. Within one
minute after smoking, or after a waiting period specified in the manufacturer's
instructions, the subject performs the breath alcohol test according to the
manufacturer's instructions. The subject is then asked to smoke another
inhalation and repeat the test to produce a total of five trials. The acceptance
criterion for this trial is as follows: no positive results. The AL-2500 device
had no positive results. Other potential interferents were not evaluated with
this device.
g. Temperature:
The DOT Model Specifications require testing 10 and 40 C to assess any
possible effects of temperature. At 10 C, 20 trials are required at 0.008 BAC
and 20 trials are required at 0.032 BAC. Acceptance criteria are: not more
than one positive result at 0.008 BAC, and not more than one non-positive
result at 0.032 BAC. The AL-2500 device had no positive results at 0.008
BAC and no non-positive results at 0.032 BAC. At 40 C, the requirements
are identical. At 40 C the AL-2500 device had no positive results at 0.008
BAC and no non-positive results at 0.032 BAC.
h. Vibration:
The DOT Model Specifications require vibration testing to assess any possible
vibrational effects. Twenty trials are required at 0.008 BAC and 0.032 BAC.
Acceptance criteria are: not more than one positive result at 0.008 BAC, and
not more than one non-positive result at 0.032 BAC. The AL-2500 device had
no positive results at 0.008 BAC and no non-positive results at 0.032 BAC.
i. Assay Cutoff:
For the purposes of performance testing, a BAC cutoff of 0.020 was used to
distinguish positive from negative samples. The sponsor states that drivers
may be impaired at a BAC of 0.05% and recommends they not operate a
motor vehicle at or above this concentration.

j. Method comparison with predicate device:
The accuracy of this device is addressed in the precision section above. In
addition, the sponsor conducted a consumer study comparing the AL-2500 to
a professional breath alcohol device. The purpose of the study was to
determine if consumers could correctly use and interpret the device using only
the supplied User's Manual, and to compare the results to the professional
device. There were 108 paired comparisons, and the volunteers ranged in age
from 20to 69 years of age. Each participant took their own breath alcohol
reading with the AL-2500 and recorded the result. Immediately afterward, the
participants were administered a breath alcohol test using an AlcoMate
CA2000 operated by a trained individual. The breath alcohol concentrations
ranged from a BAC of 0.00 to 0.31 (by the professional device). Linear
regression analysis of the data shows a slope of 1.05, a y-intercept of 0.001,
and a correlation coefficient of 0.96.
j. Consumer use study:
After the method comparison study, participants were asked questions about,
the device labeling, device operation, correlation between device labeling
instructions and operation, and interpretation of the display. Through survey
questions, device labeling, device operation, correlation between device
labeling instructions and operation, and interpretation of the display was
found to be favorable as shown in the table below. StrAgr = Stongly Agree,
SomAgr = Somewhat Agree, Nei = Neither Agree or Disagree, SomDis =
Strongly Disagree, StrDis = Strongly Disagree.
