K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
FDA Draft Guidance :Review Criteria for Assessment of Laboratory Tests for the
detection of antibodies to Helicobacter pylori. Sep. 1992
L. Test Principle:
The Premier Platinum HpSA PLUS test utilizes a mixture of monoclonal anti-H.
pylori capture antibodies adsorbed to microwells. Diluted patient samples and a
conjugate (peroxidase conjugated to monoclonal antibodies) are added to the wells
and incubated for one hour at room temperature. A wash is performed to remove
unbound material. Substrate is added and incubated for ten minutes at room
temperature. Color develops in the presence of bound enzyme. Stop Solution is
added and the results are interpreted visually or spectrophotometrically
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Assay precision, intra-assay variability and inter-assay variability were assessed with a
reference panel prepared from high positive samples (n = 2), low negative samples (n =
2), and low positive and high negative specimens (n = 1 each). The latter were diluted to
near the assay limit of sensitivity. Nine replicates each of the low positive and high
negative samples were included in the panel to bring the total cohort to 22 reference
specimens. Each reference specimen was coded to prevent its identification during
testing. Each was evaluated twice per day for three consecutive days by three different
laboratories. High negative samples (OD value just below 0.100) produced weakly positive
results (OD values just above 0.100) in 42 out of 162 tests. It is expected that high negative
samples prepared at the cut-off will produce weakly positive results 50% of the time. (See
EP12-A, User protocol for evaluation of qualitative performance; approved guideline;

NCCLS/CLSI, Vol. 22, no.14, 2002.) Low positive, high positive and low negative samples
produced the correct results 100% of the time. Reproducibility was 100% with no intra-assay
and inter-assay variability for samples prepared above or below the limit of analytical
sensitivity.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
N/A
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
N/A
d. Detection limit:
Serial dilutions of purified H. pylori flagellar antigen and a H. pylori bacterial strain
(ATCC 43504) were prepared in stool or Sample Diluent and used to determine the
lowest concentration of antigen that would still yield a definitive positive result (A
450/630
> 0.100 on Premier Platinum HpSA PLUS). Final concentrations were calculated from
the data points using linear regression analysis. The analytical limit for H. pylori flagellar
antigen is 4.67 ng/mL in stool and 0.69 ng/mL in sample diluent. The limit for H. pylori
bacterial strain is 1.0 X 106 organisms/mL in stool and 4.4 X 104 organisms/mL in
Sample Diluent.
e. Analytical specificity:
The specificity of Premier Platinum HpSA PLUS was tested by utilizing the following
bacterial, yeast or viral strains. Positive and negative stools were spiked with ≥ 1.2 X 109
bacterial or yeast organisms/mL and tested by Premier Platinum HpSA PLUS. The
concentration of viral organisms was not calculated. None of the organisms affected
positive or negative test results.

TESTS FOR INTERFERING SUBSTANCES
The following substances, that may be present in human stool do not interfere with
positive or negative test results at the stated concentrations per 500 uL human stool:
TUMS - 10 mg, Mylanta - 0.84 mg, Pepto Bismol - 0.35 mg, Tagamet - 1 mg, Prilosec
OTC - 1 mg, barium sulfate - 10 mg, whole blood - 100 uL, mucin - 6.7 mg, human
hemoglobin (ie, dark stool) – 15 mg steric + palmitic acids (ie, fatty stool) – 7.9 mg.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off value of 0.100 was established on a lot-to-lot basis with specific
procedures for optimizing solid phase and conjugate reagents. The validity of
selection of this cut-off was proven in verification studies and clinical studies
performed on three lots of fully manufactured product. The histogram
provided below plots the values of samples tested during the clinical studies.
The histogram shows that most samples consistently produce values that fall
well above the cut-off, or well below that value.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Tests with 291 samples from symptomatic patients collected either prior to or following
treatment were used to demonstrate that Premier Platinum HpSA PLUS performed
similarly to Premier Platinum HpSA. Thirty three of these samples were originally
evaluated in an earlier trial to demonstrate the effectiveness of Premier Platinum HpSA.
Test performance is detailed in the following table.

Negative Test 183/193 = 94.8%
Overall 277/287 = 96.5%
Eight of the ten samples that were positive by Premier Platinum HpSA PLUS, but
negative by Premier Platinum HpSA, were positive by CLO, histology or UBT testing.
The three samples that were positive by Premier Platinum HpSA PLUS but indeterminate
by Premier Platinum HpSA were positive by CLO, histology or UBT testing. The one
sample, that was negative by Premier Platinum HpSA PLUS but indeterminate by
Premier Platinum HpSA, was negative by CLO, histology or UBT testing.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Studies on the epidemiology of H. pylori have shown that this organism is present
worldwide. Gastritis caused by H. pylori has been shown to correlate with age, ethnic
background, family size and socioeconomic class. The prevalence of H. pylori infection
in a given population can vary from 20% to 90%. In patients diagnosed with duodenal
ulcers, however, it has been shown in every age group to be approximately 80%.
Currently recommended eradication treatments have an efficacy rate between 75% and
90%.
The Premier Platinum HpSA PLUS test detects the presence of H. pylori antigens in
human stool. Expected values for a given population should be determined for each
laboratory. The rate of positivity may vary depending on geographic location, method of
specimen collection, handling and transportation, test employed and general health
environment of patient population under study. As demonstrated by Premier Platinum
HpSA in tests conducted in the United States, Canada and Italy, incidence of disease
ranged from 34% to 53% to 69% respectively.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
