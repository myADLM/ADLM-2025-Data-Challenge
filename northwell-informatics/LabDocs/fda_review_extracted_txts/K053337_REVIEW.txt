H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Refer to Indications for use.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The EXTC Flex® reagent cartridge used on the Dimension® clinical chemistry
system provides reagents for an in vitro diagnostic test intended for the
qualitative and semi-quantitative determination of
methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and closely related drugs in
human urine using a cutoff of either 300 or 500 ng/mL. Measurements
obtained with the EXTC method are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
ecstasy use or overdose.

Page 2 of 16
The EXTC method provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more
specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a
confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)
is the preferred confirmatory method. Other chemical confirmation methods
are available. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive
results are used.
1. Special condition for use statement(s): Formatted: Bullets and Numbering
Semi-quantitative results may be helpful in estimating the concentrations of
drug(s) in samples. This can aid users when they are preparing dilutions of
the samples for further analysis.
The assay is not designated for use in point-of-care settings.
Certain foods or medications may interfere with tests for
methylenedioxymethamphetamine and cause false positive results.
For professional use only.
2. Special instrument Requirements: Formatted: Bullets and Numbering
The device is for use on automated clinical chemistry analyzers. Instruments
must be capable of maintaining a constant reaction temperature, pipetting
samples and reagents, mixing reagents, timing reactions, and measuring
enzyme rates precisely.
Performance was demonstrated in this submission on the Dimension® RxL
and Xpand® clinical chemistry systems.
F. Device Description: Formatted: Bullets and Numbering
The Dimension Urine Ecstasy Screen Flex reagent cartridge is an in vitro diagnostic
device that consists of prepackaged reagents in a plastic eight-well cartridge for use
on the Dade Behring Dimension clinical chemistry system. Wells 2 and 3 contain
enzyme conjugate. Wells 5, 6, and 8 contain antibody substrate. Wells 1 and 7 are
empty.
Syva®Emit®II Plus Ecstasy reagents are contained in the EXTC Flex® reagent
cartridge. The EXTC cartridge is used on the Dimension® system to provide an
automated application of this assay. It is based on the competition of antibody
binding sites between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the enzyme glucose-
6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH).
Matched lots of polyclonal antibody reactive to MDMA and MDA-glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase conjugate are used in the Syva®Emit®II Plus
methodology.

I. Test Principle: Formatted: Bullets and Numbering
The test is an enzyme immunoassay for use on automated clinical chemistry
analyzers. Syva® Emit® II Plus Ecstasy reagents are contained in the EXTC Flex®
reagent cartridge. The EXTC cartridge is used on the Dimension® system to provide
an automated application of this assay. It is based on the competition for antibody
binding sites between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the enzyme glucose-
6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH).
The concentration of drug in the sample determines the amount of MDA-glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase conjugate that is bound to the antibody. The unbound
conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate with the simultaneous
reduction of NAD+ to NADH, more rapidly than does the bound conjugate. The rate
of increasing absorbance at 340 nm due to the increase in NADH is related to the
concentration of drug in the sample by a mathematical function.
J. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable): Formatted: Bullets and Numbering
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
All performance was established on the Dimension® RxL and
Xpand® clinical chemistry systems.
Reproducibility was determined by assaying the cutoff calibrator
and ± 25% controls for 20 days, 2 runs per day in duplicate (n = 80).
The data were calculated according to the Clinical Laboratory
Standard Institute (CLSI) Guideline EP5-A2. Results of the studies
are presented below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Support for the lower limit of the reportable range is characterized
by the sensitivity studies.
Recovery for the EXTC Flex® reagent cartridge was assessed both
qualitatively and semi-quantitatively.
Qualitative Recovery
A qualitative recovery study was performed using negative human
urine samples spiked with MDMA at the cutoff concentration and at
-75%, -50%, -25%, +25%, +50%, +75% and +100% of the cutoff
concentration. Samples were assayed in two separate runs, with an
n=5 in each run (total of n=10). The mean rate was calculated and
compared to the rate of the cutoff calibrator.
The EXTC Flex® reagent cartridge correctly identified each of the
mean rates of spiked samples containing less than the cutoff as
negative, and each of the mean rates of spiked samples containing
greater than the cutoff as positive. Results are shown below.

c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
The Emit II Plus Ecstasy Calibrators/Controls that are referenced in
this submission were cleared under 510(k), k043028. Five levels of
calibrator/control material, ranging in concentration from 0 to 1000
ng/mL, are specified in the labeling but are supplied separately.
Calibrators/controls are drug free urine based materials spiked with
known concentrations of MDMA.
Stability studies are summarized for the EXTC Flex® reagent
cartridge.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity of the EXTC method is 25 ng/mL for the
300 ng/mL cutoff (13 uL sample size) and it represents the lowest
concentration of EXTC that can be distinguished from zero. The
sensitivity of the EXTC method is 75 ng/mL for the 500 ng/mL
cutoff (8 uL sample size). The sponsor defines analytical sensitivity

e. Analytical specificity:
The tables below list the compounds and the levels at which the
compounds have been found to give a response approximately
equivalent to that of the selected cutoff (300 or 500 ng/mL
methylenedioxymethamphetamine). Each concentration represents
the reactivity level for the stated compound when it is added to a
negative urine specimen. If a sample contains more than one
compound detected by the assay, lower concentrations than those
listed below may combine to produce a rate approximately
equivalent to or greater than that of the cutoff calibrator.

Interference Testing
Each of the following compounds when added to urine containing
methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) at +/- 25% concentration of
the cutoff do not yield a false response relative to the 300 and 500 ng/mL
cutoff levels:
Compound Concentration
Acetone 1.0 g/dL
Ascorbic Acid 1.5 g/dL
Bilirubin 2.0 mg/dL
Creatinine 0.5 g/dL
Ethanol 1.0 g/dL
Gamma Globulin 0.5 g/dL
Glucose 2.0 g/dL
Hemoglobin 115 mg/dL
Human Serum Albumin 0.5 g/dL
Oxalic Acid 0.1 g/dL
Riboflavin 7.5 mg/dL
Sodium Chloride 6.0 g/dL
Urea 6.0 g/dL
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the
claimed cutoff concentrations, 300 or 500 ng/mL, appears in the
precision section, above.
