K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
FIDIS™ CELIAC kit is a multiplexed semi-quantitative, fluorescent
immunoassay performed on the FIDIS ™ Instrument (Luminex 100™) with the
MLX Booster software. Each antigen required for the assay is covalently
coupled to an individual set of microspheres through its surface functional
groups. The different sets of antigen-coupled microspheres are mixed together
to constitute the final microspheres reagent and put into wells of a microtiter
plate. CELIAC IgA allows the detection of anti-gliadin and anti-t TG IgA
isotype antibodies. CELIAC IgG allows the detection of anti-gliadin and anti-t
TG IgG isotype antibodies. Prediluted controls and diluted patient sera are
added to separate wells allowing autoantibodies to bind to the immobilized
antigens on the beads. After incubation, a wash step through a filtration process
will remove the unbound antibodies. Then a phycoerythrin labeled anti-human
IgG or IgA is added to each well and binds to any patient antibodies/antigen
complexes on the microspheres. The samples are subsequently measured in the
FIDIS Instrument. The flow cytometer discriminates the different bead sets as
well as measures the fluorescent intensity of the conjugate on each bead. For
each sample, the antibody titer for each antigenic specificity is interpolated
against a calibration system.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To evaluate intra-assay and inter assay reproducibility, eight samples
were analyzed on the FIDIS™ CELIAC. For within-run, the eight
samples were assayed 10 times in one run and for between-run; the eight
samples were assayed 4 times per run for 6 runs. Results were as
follows:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity is not claimed for this assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or

e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering substances
To evaluate the system for potential cross reactivity to other antibodies
and interference from blood components, 24 samples for IgA and 25
samples for IgG isotypes were tested. High level of complement
proteins were used but the specific kind of complement was not
provided. A statement to avoid the use of abnormal concentration of
these samples was added to the Limitations of the Procedure. The
following results were obtained.

f. Assay cut-off:
Eighty (80) samples for the IgA isotype evaluation including 56 normal
blood donor samples and 24 samples with potential biological
interferences (see analytical specificity)and 99 samples for the IgG
isotype evaluation including 74 normal blood donor and 24 samples with
potential biological interferences (see analytical specificity) were run to
establish the cut-offs for the assays. The following results were obtained
and between these thresholds, results are considered borderline:
