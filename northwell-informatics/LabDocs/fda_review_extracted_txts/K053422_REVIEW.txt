H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
RapidOne Cocaine 150 Test is a one-step lateral flow immunoassay for the
qualitative detection of benzoylecgonine in human urine.
RapidOne Cocaine 150 Test is intended for professional use. It is not intended for
over the counter sales to nonprofessionals. The assay is easy to perform, but
should not be used without proper supervision. The immunoassay is a simplified,
qualitative screening method that provides only a preliminary result for use in
determining the need for additional or confirmatory testing, i.e., gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).
RapidOne Cocaine 150 Test provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more
specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a more
confirmed result. GC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical and
professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For professional use.
RapidOne Cocaine 150 Test provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more
specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a more
confirmed result. GC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical and
professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable
I. Device Description:
The test device consists of a membrane strip onto which a drug conjugate has been
immobilized. A colloidal gold antibody is dried at one end of the membrane. The test
kit contains instructions for use, 50 test devices to which 2 absorbent pads are
attached. The lower pad contains anti-benzoylecgonine monoclonal antibody
complex. The test line, comprised of a BSA-drug conjugate for the specific analyte, is
dried in a thin band on the membrane. A second band (control line) containing goat-
anti-mouse IgG is placed above the test line. The uppermost absorbent pad acts as a
reservoir to collect the urine sample after it migrates through the membrane.

Item Device Predicate
Cut-off 150 ng/mL 300 ng/mL
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The assay is a one-step immunoassay in which a specially labeled drug (drug
conjugate) competes with drug which may be present in the sample for the limited
number of binding sites on an antibody.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility studies were performed using commercially available
benzoylecgonine standards. Each sample at each concentration (0, 75, 113,
150 and 187 ng/mL) was tested 4 times, twice daily for 5 days. The results are
presented in the following table:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor conducted real time and accelerated studies. The protocols and
acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The sponsor
claimed the following expiration date: 1 year when stored at room temperature
or 4 - 25˚C.
The device has an internal process control. Users are instructed to
follow federal, state, and local guidelines when determining when to
run external controls.
d. Detection limit:
A drug-free urine pool was spiked with benzoylecgonine at the following
concentrations: 25% and 50% below the cutoff, cutoff and 25% above the
cutoff. The results are presented in the table below:

interference at concentrations of 100 ug/mL when tested with the RapidOne
Cocaine 150 Test:
Heroin (Diacetylmorphine)
11-Hydroxy-Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol
11-Nor-Δ8-Tetrahydrocannibinol-9-Carboxylic Acid
11-Nor-Δ9-Tetrahydrocannibinol-9-Carboxylic Acid
11-Nor-Δ9-THC-9-Carboxylic Acid Glucuronide
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking various concentrations of drug
free urine with similarly structured drug compounds that produced a positive
result. The data is presented in the table below:
Compound Concentration ng/mL
Benzoylecgonine 150
Cocaethylene 150
Cocaine 100
Metoclopramide 80,000
Procaine (Novacaine) 75,000
pH: Drug free urine was adjusted to pH values from 3 – 11. Exogenous
benzoylecgonine was added to these specimens to give a final
concentration of 150 ng/mL. The spiked, pH-adjusted urine was tested with
the RapidOne Cocaine 150 Test and interpreted according to the package
insert instructions. The results demonstrate that varying ranges of pH did not
interfere with the performance of the test and the ability of the device to detect
150 ng/mL of benzoylecgonine.
Specific Gravity: A drug free urine (specific gravity 1.020) was diluted to
produce various lower specific gravity values. Exogenous benzoylecgonine
was added to these specimens to give a final concentration of 150 ng/mL. In
addition an aqueous solution (specific gravity 1.000) of 150 ng/mL of
benzoylecgonine was evaluated. These specimens with a specific gravity
values ranging from 1.000 – 1.020 were tested with the device and
demonstrated that varying ranges of specific gravity did not interfere with the
performance of the test.
f. Assay cut-off:
Studies demonstrating assay performance around the cutoff (150 ng/mL
benzoylecgonine) are described in the precision section above. Currently, the
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)
recommends 300 ng/mL as the screening cutoff for cocaine positive
specimens.
