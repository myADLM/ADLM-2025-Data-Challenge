I. Device Description:
The Guava EZCD4 System is an optimized cell analysis system consisting of the Guava PCA
instrument, CytoSoft software for data acquisition and analysis and an EZCD4 Reagent Kit
consisting of optimized reagent and protocols. The Guava PCA instrument incorporates a
new technology termed micro capillary cytometry. The device is a 3-parameter flow
cytometer that utilizes a solid state 532 nm green laser, a fixed optical and fluidic system, a
self-aligning flow cell and a micro capillary delivery system to perform cell analysis. The
micro-syringe stepper pump allows the use of small sample volumes and volumetric
measurement for the determination of absolute counts per microliter. The instrument includes
a laptop computer. The Guava EZCD4 Reagent Kit is a two-color direct immunofluorescence
kit used for the enumeration of mature CD4+ T lymphocytes in human blood. It consists of a

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Control Guidance Document: Premarket Notification for Automated
Differential Cell Counters for Immature or Abnormal Blood Cells Final Guidance for
Industry and FDA, December 4, 2001
L. Test Principle:
The Guava EZCD4 Kit is a two-color direct immunofluorescence reagent kit for enumeration
of mature CD4+ T lymphocytes in human blood. The kit consists of a monoclonal anti-
human CD3 antibody conjugated to the tandem dye phycoerythrin (PE)-Cy5 (PECy5), a
monoclonal anti-human CD4 antibody conjugated to PE, Guava 1X Lysing Solution to lyse
erythrocytes and Guava Fixative to preserve the cells. The CD3 antibody uniquely identifies
T cells and recognizes an epitope that is expressed on the epsilon chain of the CD3/T cell
antigen receptor (TcR) complex. The CD4 antibody allows the identification of human
helper/inducer CD4+T cell (HLA Class II reactive) and recognizes a 60,000 Da MW surface
antigen. CD4 is also present on monocytes but at much lower density and lack co-expression
of the CD3 molecule. The prepared specimen is acquired by the PCA instrument. The cells
travel past a laser beam and scatter the laser light. The stained cells fluoresce and both the
scatter and fluorescence signals are detected by the instrument and analyzed to give the final
result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra-Laboratory reproducibility was established by testing at four independent
geographically distributed sites in the US. At each site, 10 replicate whole blood
samples were analyzed from each of 3 abnormal donors representing each of three

EZCD4+ absolute count ranges. These ranges were Low range (0-200), Mid range
(201-500) and High range (501-2000). Means, standard deviations (SD) and
coefficients of variation (CV) were determined for each site in each range.
The results are as follows (Intra-laboratory Reproducibility):
Study Site Range Mean SD CV n

Mid 373.20 13.79 3.69 10
High 559.65 18.07 3.23 10
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
In the linearity study, Expected versus Observed values of absolute CD4 T cell counts
were determined by the preparation of a series of blood cell aliquots, each aliquot
consisting of a decreasing volume of a bulk blood sample of known “high range
absolute CD$+T cell count and an increasing volume of a bulk blood sample of
known “low range” absolute CD4+ T cell counts. All cell aliquots were prepared in
duplicate and a total of 22 aliquots (11 pairs) were prepared.
The linear regression analysis results are as follows:
y = 1.011x – 45.237 r2 =0.9866
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Open vial stability testing was performed and determined to be up to five weeks when
stored at 2o to 8o C.
d. Detection limit:
Special indications were included in the linearity study protocol for the concentration
if absolute CD4+ T cells required of the “low bulk blood sample (<50 CD4+ T
cells/µL) and of the “high range” bulk blood sample (>2000 CD4+ T cell/µL), to
