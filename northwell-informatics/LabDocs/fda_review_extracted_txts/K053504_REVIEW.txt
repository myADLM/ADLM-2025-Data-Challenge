H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Erythromycin at concentrations of 0.12 to 16 µg/mL (Long Dilution); 0.5 – 4
µg/mL (4 Dilution Sequence BP); or 0.5-1, 4 μg/mL (3 Dilution Sequence BP) on
the MicroScan® Synergies plus ™ Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel is intended
for use with MicroScan® Synergies plus™ Panels read on the WalkAway® -SI
System (including upgraded WalkAway® -40 or WalkAway® -96 to meet
WalkAway® SI equivalence).
MicroScan® panels are designed for use in determining identification to the
species level of colonies, grown on solid media, of rapidly growing aerobic and
facultative anaerobic gram-positive cocci and Listeria; the panels also provide
quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility for staphylococci
and enterococci.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The addition of erythromycin at concentrations of 0.12 to 16 µg/mL (Long
Dilution); 0.5 – 4 µg/mL ( 4 Dilution Sequence BP); or 0.5-1, 4 μg/mL (3
Dilution Sequence BP) to the gram-positive test panel for testing Staphylococcus
spp. at 4.5-16 hours or 16-20 hours for an overnight reading.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
• Turbidity method of inoculum preparation only.
• For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
Each panel contains two control wells: a negative control well, and a growth control
well (contains test medium without antibiotic). Antibiotics are diluted in water,
buffer, or minute concentrations of broth to selected concentrations prior to
dehydration of the panels. The panel is rehydrated and inoculated at the same time
with 0.1 ml of suspension prepared by the turbidity method (inoculum prepared in
0.4% saline with PLURONIC®, then 0.1ml transferred to 25ml of inoculum
Synergies plus Pos Broth with PLURONIC®) for a final inoculum concentration of
3-7 X 105 CFU/ml. Panels are incubated in a Walk-Away® System and read
periodically starting at 4.5 hours until sufficient growth to determine the MIC.
Alternately the panels may be incubated at 35o C in a non-CO for 16-24 hours and
2
read by visual observation of growth.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) M7 (M100-S16) “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
The WalkAway® SI uses a Colorimetric Optics System consisting of a color
wheel/lamp assembly and a Photosensor. There is an initial read at 2.5 hours with a
possible final read at 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 8, 12, 16, or 18 hours (overnight instrument
readings, manual readings) depending on the growth rate of the organism being
tested. The time of final read is dependent on the growth rate of the organism and
the sensitivity of the automatic reader since cell densities below 2 x 107 cells/ml are
not detected.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates tested at 3 sites on 3
separate days in triplicate. The study included the testing on the WalkAway®
SI read at <16 hours, WalkAway® 16-18 hour readings and manual readings
at 16-20 hours incubation. The WalkAway® SI read at <16 hours had 4
results that did not grow in ≤16 hours for a no growth rate of 1.5%. All
results were >95% reproducible.
There are two breakpoint (BP) dilutions included in this submission using
different reading algorithms namely 3 Dilution sequence and 4 Dilution
sequence. Both BP dilutions were done on the same 10 isolates with
reproducibility reading based only on category agreement. Less than 16 hour
readings resulted in a no growth rate of 1.5%. The other 2 methods did not
have any isolates that did not grow. All three read methods had an acceptable
reproducibility of >95%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC isolate, S. aureus ATCC 29213 was tested a sufficient

number of times with acceptable results on all testing days with the reference
method. All results grew in the 4.5-16 hour window on the Synergies Plus.
Quality control results demonstrated the ability of the different reading
parameters (manual and instrument) to produce acceptable results.
The following table provides the frequency of the results in each
concentration with the expected range stated.

inoculation method.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical testing was conducted at 3 sites using fresh isolates supplemented
with stock isolates. A total of 301 Staphylococci spp isolates were tested of
which 263 were fresh isolates and 38 were stock isolates. There were 75
challenge isolates tested at one site and compared to the reference broth
dilution result mode that was determined by previous testing of each isolate
multiple times in the recommended reference panel. The Synergies plus™
readings were obtained between 4.5 and 16 hours of incubation for > 95% of
the results. An additional comparison was done with readings on the
instrument after overnight incubation and also read manually when incubated

16- 18 hours. Performance by these alternate reading methods was also
acceptable with no apparent differences or trends. The recommended CLSI
reference method was followed with the exception of the use of a small
amount (0.1%) PLURONIC® in the final inoculum. A validation of the use
of PLURONIC® in the frozen reference panels was conducted. Similar
calculations for the different reading methods were performed with very little
difference. The test device had a no growth rate of <10%.
The charts below demonstrated the performance of all three reading methods
(Synergies plus™ readings at <16 hours, overnight on the WalkAway® and
manually read at 18 hours using the touchScan®-SR) with the long dilution
sequence when compared to the reference method.

Evaluable results are those that fall within the test range of the reference
method and could also be on-scale with the new device if within the
plus/minus one dilution variability. EA is when there is agreement
between the reference method and the MicroScan® within plus or minus
one serial two-fold dilution of antibiotic. CA is when the interpretation of
the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the
MicroScan® result.
Similar results were obtained when the algorithm for reading the 3
