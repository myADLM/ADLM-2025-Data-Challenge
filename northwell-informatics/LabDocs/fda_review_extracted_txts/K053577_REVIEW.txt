immunoassay based on Luminescent Oxygen Channeling Immunoassay (LOCI)
technology. The LOCI reagents consists of two latex bead reagents and a reagent
containing a biotinylated anti-cardiac troponin I monoclonal antibody fragment. The
first bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains
photosensitizer dye. The second bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a second
anti-cardiac troponin I monoclonal antibody and contains chemiluminescent dye. The
sample is incubated with Chemibeads and biotinylated antibody to form a
particle/cardiac troponin I/biotinylated antibody sandwich. Sensibeads are then added
and bind to the biotin to form bead-aggregated immunocomplexes. Illumination of
the complex by light at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads, which
diffuses into the Chemibeads and triggers a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting
chemiluminescent signal is measured at 612 nm and is a direct function of the cardiac
troponin concentration in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was performed over a period of 20 days following a
protocol similar to CLSI EP5-A2 and included commercial controls as well as
normal human sera spiked with TnI at 3 different levels (0.12, 0.55, and 31.4
ng/mL). Repeatability ranged from 1.5-5.8% CV and within lab imprecision
ranged from 2.9-6.6% CV.
Limit of Quantitation (Functional Sensitivity) was evaluated by determining
the total imprecision of natural TnI samples. Two replicates of each sample
were tested once per day for 20 days. The limit of quantitation was
determined to be 0.04 ng/mL and corresponds to a coefficient of variation
(CV) of 10%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range of the assay is 0.015 to 40 ng/mL.
Linearity was evaluated by comparing the observed versus expected values
obtained with the Dimension Vista CTNI method. A high concentration
natural troponin I sample was mixed with a normal serum in different
proportions across the range of the assay. The observed results recovered in
the range of 95-99.9% of the expected TnI values.
High dose hook effect was evaluated by testing normal human sera spiked
with troponin I at high concentrations up to 1280 ng/mL. No hook effect was
observed with samples up to this level.
Accurate dilution of samples using Dimension Vista SDIL CTNI sample
diluent was demonstrated by diluting multiple elevated samples (17-40
4

--- Page 5 ---
ng/mL), at a 1:5 ratio. The sponsor determined the results to be acceptable if
recovery was within 10% of the expected value and all diluted samples met
this criterion.
The Dimension Vista system will report an error code to the user when the
signal generated by high level TnI samples exceeds 40 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and Value Assignment:
Dimension Vista CTNI calibrators are traceable to Primary Reference
Calibrators that are prepared from native human sera and assigned values
using the Dade Behring Stratus® CS system. Manufacturers Working
Calibrators (Master Pools) are prepared from a normal human serum pool
spiked with human troponin complex. Their value is measured from the
Primary Reference Calibrators tested on the Dimension Vista system, using
several instruments and reagent lots. The Master Pool value is assigned from
the mean of all test results.
The commercially available Dimension Vista CTNI calibrators consist of
troponin complex spiked into troponin I negative serum pool at three levels of
TnI. The values of these calibrators are measured from the Master Pool
calibrators tested on the Dimension Vista CTNI system, using several
instruments and reagent lots. The calibrator value is assigned for each of the
three levels from the mean of all test results.
Stability: The shelf life of the product is stated to be 12 months when stored
frozen between -10°C and -20°C. The calibrators are stable for 7 days, once
thawed if stored unopened at 2-8°C or opened and re-capped immediately.
The thawed calibrator is also stable for 7 days when stored on-board the
Dimension Vista system, once the stopper of the vial is punctured.
Stability studies were performed to support these claims. The sponsor’s
acceptance criterion was that value at each testing point should recover within
5% of the assigned bottle value.
Stability studies for the CTNI Sample Diluent were performed to support the
claim of 12 months for the unopened product when stored at 2-8°C and the
claim of 30 days for the opened product.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity was defined as the concentration corresponding to
two standard deviations above the mean of a sample containing no troponin I
(n=20). Twenty replicates of the Dimension Vista CTNI calibrator Level A (0
ng/mL) were evaluated in the CTNI assay and resulted in an analytical
sensitivity ~0.015 ng/mL.

--- Page 6 ---
The Limit of Quantitation is 0.04 ng/mL (see Precision section above).
e. Analytical specificity:
Evaluation of analytical specificity (cross-reactivity) was done by spiking
each cross-reactant to target concentration into a troponin I negative serum as
well as a serum spiked with human troponin complex to approximately 1.0
ng/mL. A control for each cross-reactant was prepared by spiking the samples
with the same volume of the solvent used for reconstituting the cross-reactant.
The cross-reactant test samples and the control samples were measured on the
Dimension Vista and the cross-reactivity was calculated.
Cross-reactant Concentration % Cross-reactivity
Troponin-C (cardiac) 1000 ng/mL None
Troponin-T (cardiac human) 1000 ng/mL 0.06
Troponin-I (skeletal human) 1000 ng/mL 0.12
Troponin-I (skeletal human) 280 ng/mL 0.13
The effect of potentially interfering substances, including endogenous
substances, commonly ingested substances and cardiac drugs were tested by
spiking a sample containing approximately 1 ng/mL TnI with the appropriate
concentration of the test substance and comparing the TnI recovery of the
sample to that of a control sample. The control sample was prepared by
spiking the TnI sample with an equal volume of the solvent used to dissolve
the test substance. The sponsor defined interference as a difference in
recovery between the test sample and control greater than 10%.
Hemoglobin hemolysate (up to 500 mg/dL), conjugated and unconjugated
bilirubin (up to 40 mg/dL), lipid (up to 3000 mg/dL), and cholesterol (up to
500 mg/dL) did not interfere with the test. A panel of commonly ingested
substances, over-the-counter drugs and cardiac drugs did not interfere with the
assay. A list of these substances can be found in the package insert.

4. Clinical cut-off:
A cut-off range of 0.6-1.5 ng/mL was established for the Dade Behring Stratus
Cardiac TnI assay in k951890. A previous method comparison study (k973650)
with the Cardiac Troponin I method for the Dimension RxL demonstrated
substantial equivalence of that assay to the Stratus Cardiac TnI assay. A method
comparison of the current device to Dimension RxL was performed to support the
current Dimension Vista TnI assay (see method comparison above).
5. Expected values/Reference range:
In a study of 199 serum samples from apparently healthy individuals, the upper
limit of the 99th percentile for the Dimension VISTA™ CTNI method was
determined to be 0.045 ng/mL.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
