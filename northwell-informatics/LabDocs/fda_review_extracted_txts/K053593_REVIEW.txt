L. Test Principle:
When a whole blood sample is applied to the sample chamber of the test strip, glucose
measurement commences. Glucose measurement is based on electrical potential caused by
the reaction of glucose with the reagents contained on the strip’s electrodes. The glucose in
the sample is oxidized by the enzyme glucose oxidase, producing gluconolactone. The
current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured and converted to glucose
concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is proportional to the concentration
of glucose in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within day imprecision was evaluated by assaying five spiked whole blood samples
of differing concentrations in one run using 10 meters and three lots of test strips
(n=300). The results are summarized below:

summarized below (units = mg/dL):

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the glucose measurements was demonstrated by comparing blood
samples on the Prodigy glucose meter and the glucose reference method (YSI) across
the reportable range of the device (20-600 mg/dL). Whole blood samples were spiked
with D-glucose to nine targeted glucose concentrations (20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 200, 320,
420, and 600 mg/dL). For each concentration, ten consecutive tests were performed
(5 tests per lot) on each meter. The linear regression of the data yielded the following
2
relationship: y = 0.998x + 2.989, R = 0.999.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Two levels of control material (normal and high) are provided for use with the test
system. The controls are prepared gravimetrically in an aqueous matrix. Expected
values are verified for each manufactured lot. The mean value for a typical lot is 137
mg/dL (normal) and 347 mg/dL (high). The open, closed, and transport stability were
tested. The sponsor’s protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
20 mg/dL – see linearity section above M.1.b
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor tested the effects of hematocrit (20-60%), temperature, humidity,
resistance to drop and vibration and altitude on the meter’s performance. The meter
was tested at different altitudes to assess the effect of low oxygen levels on the meter
performance. No effect on performance was found when three different levels of
controls were tested at 10,000 ft. Higher elevations were not tested. The sponsor
presented data that supported using the test system between 10ºC to 40ºC.
The effect of sample hematocrit variation on the Prodigy system was tested by
preparing samples of known hematocrit and spiking aliquots of these samples with six
different levels of glucose. These samples were assayed on the Prodigy and YSI
systems. The results showed less than a +20% bias at glucose concentrations >75
mg/dL and less than a ±15 mg/dL bias at glucose concentrations <75 mg/dL across the
claimed range of 20-60% Hematocrit.
Specificity of the assay was assessed by spiking various endogenous and exogenous
compounds into prepared whole blood samples. The sponsor prepared a low whole

blood control (approximately 80 mg/dL) and a high whole blood control
(approximately 300 mg/dL) glucose and confirmed these concentrations prior to the
addition of the interferents. The sponsor added the interfering substance and assayed
each control solution on the Prodigy system. If the change in glucose measurement
from the control solution was less the 10%, the sponsor considered this as no
interference. The results of the study are presented in the table below:

f. Assay cut-off:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
One hundred and twenty capillary blood samples were collected and assayed on the
Prodigy system and then assayed on the predicate device. The sample range was 27-
389 mg/dL. The resulting linear regression is as follows: y=1.03x -2.98; R2 =0.98.
The accuracy of the assay was evaluated by testing one hundred and thirty five
capillary blood samples on the Prodigy system and compared to a reference method
(YSI). The sponsor’s acceptance criteria were based on ISO 15197
recommendations: 95% of the individual results shall fall within +15 mg/dL at
glucose concentration <75 mg/dL and within 20% at glucose concentration >75
mg/dL. The results are presented in the tables below:

O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Single use device for the test strips.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes _X___ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger only. Since
the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no special handling or
storage issues.
5. Calibration:
A code strip is supplied with each vial of test strips to calibrate the meter for the vial. No
further calibrations are required of the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor is providing a normal and high glucose solution with this device. After
inserting the test strip press the M (memory) key, “CtL” will be displayed and the control
mode is activated. This prevents the control results from being stored in the internal
memory. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label.
If the control results fall outside these ranges, the user is referred to a list of
troubleshooting steps and a customer care number.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
