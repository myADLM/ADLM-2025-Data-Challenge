K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI Guideline EP7-A; CLSI Guideline EP9-A2; CLSI Guideline C-28-A2
L. Test Principle:
The i-STAT BNP test cartridge uses a two-site enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay
(ELISA) method. Antibodies specific for BNP are located on an electrochemical sensor
fabricated on a silicon chip. Also deposited in another location on the sensor silicon chip is
an antibody/alkaline phosphatase enzyme conjugate specific to a separate portion of the BNP
molecule. The whole blood or plasma sample is brought into contact with the sensors
allowing the enzyme conjugate to dissolve into the sample. The BNP within the sample
becomes labeled with alkaline phosphatase and is captured onto the surface of the
electrochemical sensor during an incubation period of approximately seven minutes. The
sample is washed off the sensors, as well as excess enzyme conjugate. Within the wash fluid
is a substrate for the alkaline phosphatase enzyme. The enzyme bound to the
antibody/antigen/antibody sandwich cleaves the substrate releasing an electrochemically
detectable product. The electrochemical (amperometric) sensor measures this enzyme
product which is proportional to the concentration of BNP within the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision data were collected as follows: duplicates of each control were tested daily
for a period of 20 days for each of 3 lots of cartridges, resulting in a total of 434
replicates. The average statistics are presented below.
Aqueous Control Mean % CV (within-run) % CV (total)
Level 1 126 9.0 11.1
Level 2 1551 6.6 8.1
Level 3 3337 8.0 9.8
Whole blood imprecision data were collected as follows: whole blood samples from 5
healthy donors were spiked to low, intermediate and high BNP concentrations
affording 15 samples, each of which was measured in 10 i-STAT BNP cartridges
from a single cartridge lot; three lots of cartridges were employed. The mean within-
sample BNP concentration ranged from 84 – 3925 pg/mL and the within-sample
imprecision (%CV) ranged from 3.4 to 9.4%; the average BNP concentration and
imprecision were 1464 pg/mL and 6.5% respectively. The individual results are
presented in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The dilution linearity of the i-STAT BNP test was studied using EDTA whole blood
and plasma samples derived from 3 separate donors. For each donor, the original
BNP negative sample and a BNP spiked sample were prepared. This process yielded
three BNP positive whole blood samples that were then assayed in duplicate for each
of 3 separate i-STAT BNP cartridge lots. These whole blood samples were then
diluted using an equal mass of the original unspiked whole blood and assayed in
duplicate. From this whole blood data, the BNP recovery was calculated.
Whole blood Concentration Diluted concentration % recovery
A 590 312 106%
B 2765 1429 103%
C 5123 2803 109%
The plasma derived from these three donors was combined in all pair-wise
combinations in equal volumes. These combinations were then assayed in duplicate
for each of 3 separate i-STAT BNP cartridge lots. The BNP recovery for each pair
was calculated using the average of the 6 results.

A plasma sample was spiked with BNP to a value of approximately 5000 pg/mL. This
sample was subjected to a series of dilutions with fresh, un-spiked plasma in order to
prepare a range of concentrations. The concentration of each sample/dilution was
calculated based on the measured concentration of the initial solution and the
dilutions performed. The diluted samples were then measured in i-STAT BNP test
cartridges (N = 6-10). The procedure was repeated with a whole blood sample. The
results of these experiments are summarized in the following table:
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The i-STAT BNP calibrators are traceable to an internal reference standard that has
been prepared gravimetrically with synthetic BNP. The internal reference standard
underwent a one-time value assignment to align with the ARCHITECT BNP assay
with a decision threshold of 100 pg/mL. Manufacturers working calibrators are
prepared by gravimetric manipulation of the standard and incorporate a one-time
value assignment for alignment of methods. The i–STAT, AxSYM and ARCHITECT
assays have been designed, by virtue of their calibration, to report comparable values.
The i-STAT vs. ARCHITECT method comparison data exhibits a correlation slope of
0.97 (see method comparison section). Similar data for the ARCHITECT vs.
AxSYM exhibited a slope of 1.03.
Stability studies were performed to evaluate the intended storage (open and closed
vial) for the i-STAT controls and calibration verification materials. The real-time
frozen stability of BNP control/calibration verification materials was established for 3
lots of material, each comprised of 3 levels. Stability was judged to be acceptable
provided that the mean BNP concentration measured at each test event be within ± 20
% of the original mean concentration. The stability was acceptable over 5 months
frozen storage. The stability studies are ongoing.
6

--- Page 7 ---
The labeling for the i-STAT controls and calibration verification materials states that,
after thawing, the opened or unopened vial is stable for 4 hours when capped and
stored at 2 – 8 º. Stability studies performed support the 4 hour time limit.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of the blank for the BNP method is 15 pg/mL, which is the lowest BNP
level that can be distinguished from zero. The value was estimated using a control
material with < 5 pg/mL BNP during a 20 day precision study in which 3 separate
lots of BNP test cartridges were tested in duplicate using a pool of 6 i-STAT 1
analyzers for a total of 147 test results.
e. Analytical specificity:
The following muscle proteins were tested at both 1000 pg/mL and 20,000 pg/mL
concentrations and found to have no detectable cross-reactivity for BNP: ANP, CNP,
and N-terminal pro-BNP.
The i-STAT BNP assay employs electrochemical rather than optical detection. An
electrogenic substrate is cleaved by an enzyme label giving rise to an electroactive
product that can be oxidized at a sensor electrode generating a signal comprised of
electrical current, therefore optical interferents, including hemoglobin, bilirubin, and
chylomicrons, do not interfere with this mode of detection.
The following substances were found to have no significant effect (less than 10%) on
the BNP method, when added to a plasma pool containing approximately 1000 pg/mL
of B-type natriuretic peptide at the concentrations indicated:
7

--- Page 8 ---
f. Assay cut-off:
BNP results less than or equal to 100 pg/mL are representative of normal values in
patients without CHF. See Clinical cut-off section below.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison data were collected using CLSI guideline EP9-A2. Venous blood
samples were collected in EDTA evacuated tubes and analyzed in duplicate on the i-
STAT System. A portion of the specimen was centrifuged and the separated plasma
was analyzed in duplicate on the i-STAT 1 System and on the comparative method,
the Abbott ARCHITECT BNP assay, within 1 hour of collection. Deming regression
analysis was performed on the first replicate of each sample. In the method
comparison table, n is the number of specimens in the first data set, Sxx and Syy refer
to estimates of imprecision based on the duplicates of the comparative and the i-
STAT methods respectively. Sy.x is the standard error of the estimate, and r is the
correlation coefficient. The samples had BNP values ranging from 5-5000 mg/dL.
8

--- Page 9 ---
b. Matrix comparison:
EDTA plasma is the only sample type indicated. The labeling states that performance
characteristics have not been established for samples taken from capillary tubes and
direct skin punctures (e.g. fingersticks) so these sample types should not be used with
the BNP cartridge.
3. Clinical studies:
Clinical studies performed with the Abbott AxSYM BNP assay are included in the
labeling for the i-STAT BNP assay. The applicant provided the following to support the
transfer of reference ranges:
• The AxSYM, ARCHITECT and i-STAT BNP assays employ an identical
antibody set. The average imprecision is similar for the 3 assays as follows:
AxSYM average %CV = 7.9 %; ARCHITECT average %CV = 5.2 %; i-STAT
average %CV = 9.7 %.
• The i–STAT, AxSYM and ARCHITECT assays have been designed, by virtue of
their calibration, to report comparable values.
• The CLSI document C28-A2, How to Define and Determine Reference Intervals
in the Clinical Laboratory, provides guidance concerning the transferability of
reference ranges from one measurement system to another. The i-STAT vs.
ARCHITECT method comparison data exhibits a correlation slope of 0.97 (see
method comparison section above). Also, similar data for the ARCHITECT vs.
AxSYM exhibited a slope of 1.03 (see k060964).

a. Clinical Sensitivity:
In studies performed with the AxSYM BNP Assay, age-matched analysis of the heart
failure and non-heart failure populations was performed based on the data published
by the American Heart Association in the 2000 Heart and Stroke Statistical Update
and according to the age structure of the United States population. The age
distributions in the intended use population are approximately as follows: individuals
less than 45 years old comprise 9%, individuals 45-54 years old comprise 11%,
individuals 55-64 years old comprise 22%, individuals 65-74 years old comprise
26%, and individuals 75 years and older comprise 32%. The resulting combined AUC
is 0.87 (0.85 to 0.90, 95%CI). The clinical sensitivity and specificity using a decision
threshold of 100 pg/mL is presented in the table below.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Data from the clinical studies performed with the AxSYM BNP assay were used to
generate The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of BNP decision thresholds
versus clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity. At a decision threshold of 100 pg/mL,
the BNP assay demonstrated a clinical sensitivity and specificity of 74.2% and 91.5%
respectively. The area under the curve is 0.90 (0.86 to 0.92, 95% CI).
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Plasma samples from 890 individuals (465 females, 425 males) who had not been
diagnosed with heart failure were tested with the AxSYM BNP assay. This population
included non-hospitalized patients with renal disease (not on dialysis), diabetes,
hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. BNP levels for these patients
were not statistically different from the population of apparently healthy individuals. The
data are summarized below.
