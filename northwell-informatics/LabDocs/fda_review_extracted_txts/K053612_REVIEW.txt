1. Predicate device name(s):
Dri-STAT® Reagent ACP on Cobas Fara
2. Predicate K number(s):
k821674
3. Comparison with predicate:
The devices have the same intended use and methodology. The instrument

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI EP5-A - Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry
Devices
CLSI EP-17A - Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of
Quantitation
L. Test Principle:
The reagents include α-naphthylphosphate, which is converted to α-naphthol in
the presence of ACP; and FAST RED TR, which reacts with α-naphthol to
produce a chromogen. The increase in absorbance at 405 nm is proportional to
the concentration of ACP in the sample. The test is run in the absence and
presence of tartrate. The difference between the two values for each sample is
attributed to the prostatic isoenzyme.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Evaluations were performed on the Synchron CX and LX.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated at the manufacturer's site using the manufacturer’s
serum control material as well as serum pools spiked with (potato) acid
phosphatase. Calculations, based on 2 runs/day, with 2 replicates per run,
over 20 consecutive days, were performed according to CLSI (NCCLS) EP-
5A.
Data presented in the 510(k) was obtained from a single instrument. The
manufacturer reports that results form 4 instruments were similar. Results in
the 510(k) met the following manufacturer’s acceptance criteria:

--- Page 3 ---
Page 3 of 5
Within-run: SD < 1.0U/L (below 33.3U/L) or < 3.0% CV (above 33.3 U/L)
Total: SD < 1.5 U/L (below 33.3 U/L) or < 4.5% CV (above 33.3 U/L)
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Evaluations were based on multiple inter-dilutions of spiked patient
specimens with zero-level serum samples. Seven dilution levels across the
range of the assay were prepared and each level was evaluated in triplicate.
Linearity of non-prostatic acid phosphatase (NPAP) and total acid
phosphatase (TACP) were measured separately. Target values were defined
based on the middle dilution levels and the dilution factors. The assay range
is 2.0-38.0 ug/ml. Average recovery (of triplicates at each level), relative to
the target value, was near 100% for TACP and within +/- 5% of 100% for
NPAP.
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
Controls were cleared under k82264 and were not reviewed in this 510(k).
The assay is a non-calibrated enzymatic assay.
The following are used to evaluate comparison across lots:
i. Each new lot of reagent is tested for recoveries using 3 levels of control
materials, and a previous lot of reagent is tested at the same time as a
reference. The manufacturer’s acceptance criteria for new lots is to recover
within insert range of the Level 1 control, within ± 2 U/L of the insert mean
for Level 2 and within ± 3 U/L of the insert mean for Level 3 control values.
ii. Acceptance criteria for the methods comparison studies are slopes of 1.0 ±
0.15, intercepts of within ± 2 S.D or ± 2 U/L and an R of ≥ 0.990.
d. Detection limit:
The evaluation of limit of detection was based on the CLSI Protocol EP-17A.
A saline blank and a low level sample, were evaluated. Results are shown
below. Additional sensitivity testing, performed using human albumin in
saline as a blank yielded similar results.

e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous compounds were spiked into pooled patient serum samples
containing three levels of ACP. Samples at each level were spiked with
interferent to concentrations as high as 30 mg/dL bilirubin, 500 mg/dL
Intralipid, and 500 mg/dL hemoglobin and results were compared to those of
control samples without interferent. Recovery relative to the control were
within +/-2 U/L, or 6% of expected results for samples containing intralipid
and bilirubin. Reduced recovery was observed in some samples containing
hemoglobin near 125 mg/dL, though all results were within +/-4U/L.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device
Samples were evaluated on the Cobas Fara (predicate) and on the Synchron
CX and LX Systems. Patient samples were evaluated and also
supplemented with spiked samples, especially at the high range. Results of
analysis by Deming regression are shown below.
