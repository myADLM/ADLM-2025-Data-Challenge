L. Test Principle:
The glucose oxidase and potassium ferricyanide in the strip react with the glucose in the
sample to produce an electrical current which is proportional to the amount of glucose in the
sample. The meter measures the current and converts it to the corresponding glucose
concentration. See k042678 for more information.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated the precision of the device using replicate measurements of
glucose control solutions and anticoagulated venous whole blood. For a more
detailed description, see k042678.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the device was demonstrated by comparing eleven prepared whole
blood samples on the Rightest and a glucose reference method. The eleven equally
spaced samples ranged in concentration from a low of approximately 50 mg/dL to a
high of approximately 550 mg/dL. Linear regression of the comparison data yielded
the following relationship: Rightest = (1.02 X Reference Method) - 15 mg/dL, r2 =
0.9957. The reportable range of the Rightest meter is 20 - 600 mg/dL. For a more
detailed description, see k042678.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The controls supplied with this device were previously cleared under k012431. The
sponsor has shown traceability of the Rightest meter to a laboratory analyzer. For a
more detailed description, see k042678.
d. Detection limit:
20 mg/dL. For a more detailed description, see k042678.
e. Analytical specificity:
The specificity of the device was assessed by preparing five venous whole blood
samples ranging in concentration from approximately 50 - 300 mg/dL. The five
samples were divided into aliquots and spiked with twenty potential interferents,
including endogenous and exogenous substances, anticoagulants, and preservatives.
This was designated the test sample. A control sample was also prepared, which
consisted of the venous whole blood sample and the solvent for the interferent, but
not the interferent itself. For a more detailed description of the interference results,
see k042678.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor did two method comparison studies. The first study compared capillary
blood from finger, palm, and forearm tested by a technician on the Rightest Blood
Glucose Monitoring System and comparing each test to the blood drawn from the
same areas and analyzed on YSI 2300D for each patient. The second study compared
capillary blood from finger, palm, and forearm tested by the patient on the Rightest
Blood Glucose Monitoring System and comparing each test to the blood drawn from
the same areas and analyzed on YSI 2300D. All patients blood glucose levels were in
a steady state for these studies. The two studies are summarized below:

N. Instrument Name:
Bionime Corporation Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes X or No ________ See k042678 for more information.
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm, or
forearm only. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are
no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
A Smart Code Key is provided with each batch of test strips to calibrate the meter for that
batch. No further calibrations are required of the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor is providing a high and low glucose control solution with this device. When
the Check Key is inserted into the meter, the control mode is activated. This prevents
control results from being stored in the internal memory. An acceptable range for each
control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is referred to the
troubleshooting section of the User’s Manual if control results fall outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
