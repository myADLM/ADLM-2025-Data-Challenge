L. Test Principle:
FIDIS™ Connective 10* is a multiplexed semi-quantitative, fluorescent
immunoassay performed on the FIDIS ™ Instrument (Luminex 100™) with the MLX
Booster software. Each antigen (dsDNA, SSA [60 kDA and 52 kDA], SSB, Sm,
Sm/RNP, Scl-70, Jo-1, ribosome and centromere) is covalently coupled to an
individual set of microspheres through its surface functional groups. The different
sets of antigen-coupled microspheres are mixed together to constitute the final
microspheres reagent and put into wells of a microtiter plate. Prediluted controls and
diluted patient sera are added to separate wells allowing autoantibodies to bind to the
immobilized antigens on the beads. After incubation, a wash step through a filtration
process will remove the unbound antibodies. Then a phycoerythrin labeled anti-
human IgG is added to each well and binds to any patient autoantibodies/antigen
complexes on the microspheres. The samples are subsequently measured in the FIDIS
Instrument. The flow cytometer discriminates the different bead sets as well as
measures the fluorescent intensity of the conjugate on each bead. For each sample,
the antibody titer for each antigenic specificity is interpolated against a calibration
system.
FIDIS™ Connective 10* was optimized by flow cytometry for the average binding
capacity at the given dilution (1:200) from the median fluorescence value using 200
microspheres per parameter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To evaluate intra-assay and inter assay reproducibility, five samples covering
the reportable range of the assay were analyzed on the FIDIS™ Connective
10*. For within-run, the five samples were assayed 10 times in one run and for
between-run; the three samples were assayed 2 times per run for 6 runs.
Results were as follows:

• 50 samples from blood donors
• 48 samples selected from their potential biological interferences and
according to WHO standard for dsDNA specificity

The negative thresholds (30 AU/mL or 30 IU/mL) correspond to the 97.9th
percentile for dsDNA, SSA, Sm/RNP; 99.0% for centromere and ribosome, and
100% for SSB, Sm, Scl70 and Jo1 for the populations studied.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
