L. Test Principle:
Not applicable. This submission is for calibrators and controls.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Primary calibrators and controls are prepared gravimetrically by adding Synthetic
DHEA-S obtained from a commercial source to a human serum-based matrix. The
secondary calibrators and controls are also prepared gravimetrically by adding Synthetic
DHEA-S obtained from a commercial source to a human serum-based matrix. Relative
light unit (RLU) testing is performed and RLU values are compared to the corresponding
Primary Calibrator or Control. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria is that RLU variation
must be within +/- 1.5%.
Target values for secondary calibrators are 0, 5, 12, 60, 300, and 1500 μg/dL DHEA-S.
Target values for secondary controls are 10, 100, and 1000 μg/dL DHEA-S.
The DHEA-S Calibrators and Controls are stable for 6 months if stored at 2 to 8 ºC.
Protocols and acceptance criteria for stability testing were described and found to be
acceptable.
