H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Ampicillin at concentrations of 0.12-64 µg/mL on the MicroScan® Synergies
plus ™ Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel is intended for use with MicroScan®
Synergies plus™ Panels read on the WalkAway® -SI System (including upgraded
WalkAway® -40 or WalkAway® -96 to meet WalkAway® SI equivalence).
MicroScan® panels are designed for use in determining identification to the
species level of colonies, grown on solid media, of rapidly growing aerobic and
facultative anaerobic gram-positive cocci and Listeria; the panels also provide
quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility for Staphylococci
and Enterococci.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The testing of Ampicillin at concentrations of 0.12-64µg/mL or 6-8 µg/mL
(Breakpoint Dilution Sequence) on the gram-positive test panel for testing
Enterococcus spp. at 4.5-18 hours for either an earlier reading or an overnight
reading
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
• Turbidity method of inoculum preparation only.
• For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
Each panel contains two control wells: a negative control well, and a growth control
well (contains test medium without antibiotic). Antibiotics are diluted in water,
buffer, or minute concentrations of broth to selected concentrations prior to
dehydration of the panels. The panel is rehydrated and inoculated at the same time
with 0.1 ml of suspension prepared by the turbidity method (inoculum prepared in
0.4% saline with PLURONIC®, then 0.1ml transferred to 25ml of inoculum
Synergies plus Pos Broth with PLURONIC®) for a final inoculum concentration of
3-7 X 105 CFU/ml. Panels are incubated in a Walk-Away® System and read

periodically starting at 4.5 hours until sufficient growth to determine the MIC.
Alternately the panels may be incubated at 35o C in a non-CO for 16-24 hours and

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) M7 (M100-S16) “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
The WalkAway® SI uses a Colorimetric Optics System consisting of a color
wheel/lamp assembly and a Photosensor. There is an initial read at 2.5 hours with a
possible final read at 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 8, 12, 16, or 18 hours (overnight instrument
readings, manual readings) depending on the growth rate of the organism being
tested. The time of final read is dependent on the growth rate of the organism and
the sensitivity of the automatic reader since cell densities below 2 x 107 cells/ml are
not detected.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates tested at 3 sites on 3
separate days in triplicate. The study included the testing on the WalkAway®
SI read at <16 hours, WalkAway® 16-18 hour readings and manual readings
at 16-20 hours incubation. The WalkAway® SI had 9 results that were not
readable at <16 hours for a no growth rate of 3%. Results were >95%
reproducible for all read methods.
Breakpoint readings were performed on the same 10 Enterococci isolates with
reproducibility based on a category reading. Less than 16 hour readings
resulted in > 95% reproducibility with 3% no growth at <16 hour. Overnight
readings performed on the same panels for the WalkAway® 16-18 hour
readings and manual readings at 16-20 hours incubation were also > 95%
reproducible with no isolates that did not grow.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended Quality Control isolate was tested a sufficient number of
times with acceptable results on all testing days with the reference method.
All results grew in the 4.5-16 hour window. Quality control results
demonstrated the ability of the different reading parameters (manual and
4

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical testing was conducted at 3 sites using fresh isolates supplemented
with stock isolates. A total of 306 Enterococci spp. were tested of which 213
were fresh isolates. There were 75 challenge isolates tested at one site and
compared to the reference broth dilution result mode that was determined by
previous testing of each isolate multiple times in the recommended reference
panel. The Synergies plus™ results were obtained at read times between 4.5
and 15 hours of incubation for >95% of the results. An additional comparison
was done with readings on the instrument after overnight incubation and also
read manually when incubated 16- 18 hours. Performance by these alternate
reading methods was also acceptable with no apparent differences or trends.

Comparison was made to the recommended CLSI reference method which
was followed with the exception of the use of a small amount (0.1%)
PLURONIC® in the final inoculum. A validation of the use of PLURONIC®
in the frozen reference panels was conducted. Similar calculations for the
different reading methods were performed with very little difference. The
chart below demonstrates the performance of Synergies plus™ readings at
<16 hours when compared to the reference method.

Evaluable results are those that fall within the test range of the reference
method and could also be on-scale with the new device if within the
plus/minus one dilution variability. EA is when there is agreement
between the reference method and the MicroScan® within plus or minus
one serial two-fold dilution of antibiotic. CA is when the interpretation of
the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the
MicroScan® result.
Similar results were obtained when the algorithm for reading a breakpoint
panel with 2, 4 and 8 µg/mL wells with no difference in CA. EA was not
calculated for these readings since insufficient numbers of concentrations
were available for the evaluation.
