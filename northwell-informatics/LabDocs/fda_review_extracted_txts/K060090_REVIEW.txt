I. Device Description:
The TSH method is a homogeneous, sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based
on Luminescent Oxygen Channeling Immunoassay (LOCITM) technology. The
LOCITM reagents include two latex bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-TSH
monoclonal antibody fragment. The first bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with
streptavidin and contains photosensitizer dye. The second bead reagent
(Chemibeads) is coated with a second anti-TSH monoclonal antibody and contains
chemiluminescent dye. Sample is incubated with biotinylated antibody and
Chemibeads to form bead-TSH-biotinylated antibody sandwiches. Sensibeads are
added to bind to the biotin to form bead-pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the
complex at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the
Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is
measured at 612 nm and is a direct function of the TSH concentration in the sample.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linear range of the Dimension VistaTM Thyroid Stimulating Hormone
Flex® reagent cartridge was confirmed by assaying samples prepared from
dilutions of the Level C calibrator. The TSH concentrations observed in the
samples ranged from 0.008 to 102.9 μIU/mL. The means of the observed
values for each sample were plotted versus the expected values. The linear
relationship appeared acceptable by visual examination. Results are
summarized below.
Sample Expected Value, Observed Value,
μIU/mL μIU/mL
1 0.000 0.008
2 26.4 25.2
3 52.9 51.0
4 79.3 77.7
5 105.7 102.9
Least squares regression analysis gave the following: Observed =
0.98(Expected) – 0.32; r = 0.9999
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The LOCI I calibrator (k053531), is used to calibrate the Dimension Vista™
flex® reagent cartridge. The calibrator is referenced to the WHO 2nd IRP
80/558 standard. See k053531 for more information.
Dimension VistaTM Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Flex® reagent cartridges
were stored in a controlled environment at 2-8°C. QC materials (3 levels of
Bio-Rad Lyphochek Immunoassay Plus Control, lot 40150) and a human
serum pool were aliquotted and frozen at -70°C. On each measuring day, one
aliquot was thawed, the Dimension Vista TSH method was calibrated, and the
QC material and serum pool run in 5 replicates. The analyte values obtained
on each day were averaged over the replicates. At the end of the study, the
mean values for each day were graphed against the day, inspected visually,
and analyzed by linear regression. The Dimension VistaTM Thyroid
Stimulating Hormone Flex® reagent cartridge was shown to be stable up to
366 days.
d. Detection limit:
Functional sensitivity was determined by measuring eight serum pools
ranging in concentration from 0.004 to 0.021 μIU/mL. Each sample was
tested twice a week for approximately six weeks. The concentration at which
assay imprecision was calculated to be 20 % CV (by interpolation) is 0.005
μIU/mL.

e. Analytical specificity:
To test the crossreactivity of this device to similar endogenous analytes, serum
samples were spiked with hCG, LH, and FSH at 200000, 1000, and 1000
mIU/mL, respectively, and compared to a non-spiked base pool. No analytes
tested significantly cross-reacted in this analysis.
A patient serum sample was spiked with specific concentrations of potential
interfering substances, and the TSH values were obtained using the
Dimension VistaTM Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Flex® reagent cartridge
then compared to a non-spiked control sample. Bias exceeding 10% is
considered interference. No interference was found. Results are summarized
below.
Substance Amount [TSH] Bias
μIU/mL
Hemoglobin 1000 mg/dL 4.32 -8.2
(hemolysate)
Bilirubin 60 mg/dL 4.32 -2.6

Biotin 500 ng/mL 4.32 -4.9
Dextran 40 3 g/dL 4.32 9.4
The potential for a high dose hook effect was evaluated for this assay by
spiking a human serum pool that was initially 0.80 μIU/mL TSH to 30,000
μIU/mL TSH. The spiked pool was serially diluted into the assay range. Data
shows no overlap in instrument response demonstrating thatthere is no high
dose hook effect up to 30,000 μIU/mL.

b. Matrix comparison:
Samples from 55 patients were then used to compare serum results to sodium
heparin plasma (with TSH levels ranging from 0.299-97.0 μIU/mL), lithium
heparin plasma (with TSH levels ranging from 0.266-97.0 μIU/mL), and
EDTA plasma samples (with TSH levels ranging from 0.259-97.0 μIU/mL) in
order to demonstrate that serum results match plasma results. Results are
summarized below.
Comparison Slope Y-Intercept r
Serum vs Na heparin plasma 1.01 0.36 0.997
Serum vs Li heparin plasma 1.02 0.19 0.998
Serum vs EDTA plasma 0.99 0.05 0.999
3. Clinical studies:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Serum samples from 297 apparent healthy adult blood bank donors (187 males
and 110 females, ages 18 to 65) were commercially purchased and assayed with
the Dimension VistaTM Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Flex® reagent cartridge.
The expected normal range for the Dimension VistaTM Thyroid Stimulating
