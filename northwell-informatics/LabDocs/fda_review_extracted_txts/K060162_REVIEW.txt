510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
K060162
B. Purpose for Submission:
Special submission for a software modification to the PT and APTT test parameters
of two new ACL 9000 family members- the ACL Elite and ACL Elite Pro.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Instrumentation Laboratory ACL Elite and ACL Elite Pro
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Coagulometric tests (PT-FIB, APTT, TT, Single Factors)
Absorbance Tests (Antithrombin, Heparin, Protein C, Plasmin Inhibitor, Plasminogen
Fibrinogen C –Clauss method)
Immunological Tests (D-Dimer, free Protein S, von Willebrand Factor-Activity and
Antigen)
Special Tests (Protein S, Factor V Leiden, LAC Screen and Confirm, ProClot C-
clotting Protein C)
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description: The ACL is a family of fully automated computer-
controlled, microcentrifugal analyzers. The ACL Elite/Elite Pro system incorporates
a liquid crystal display (LCD) unit that shows the status of the instrument, permits the
user to select desired procedures, and through the use of menus and options guides
the operator through these procedures. Information and instructions are entered into
the system either via a touch screen device or through a standard PC keyboard or
mouse.
2. Principles of Operation:
When sample testing is initiated, the samples and reagents are sequentially
pipetted into a 20-cuvette polystyrene rotor (loading process). A centrifugation
process then mixes sample and reagents. The mixing is carried out by a
combination or rapid acceleration and braking actions, which are effective in
1

--- Page 2 ---
thoroughly mixing the liquids. Reaction measurements (data acquisition) via the
photometer are made while the rotor is spinning.
The ACL measures the parameters at 37°C ± 1° C, at ambient temperature from
15°C to 32°C. However, if the ACL is in a temperature –controlled environment
where temperature is held constant, the measurements are made within a narrower
temperature range: 37°C ± 0.25° C.
The results are displayed on the LCD and optionally printed by the external
printer, and/or sent to a host computer. The ACL performs automatic calibration,
offers a series of utility programs for the operator and manages a complete quality
control program.
3. Modes of Operation:
The user may program single or multiple tests on patient samples to be performed
on a random access basis. Users also have the capability to pause the system
during an analytical session for STAT samples.
4. Specimen Identification:
On-board and external barcode reader, manual entry.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Samples are collected, centrifuged, and loaded onto one of three different sample
trays. The ACL contains an autosampler system that pipettes samples and
reagents into the loading and analysis area.
6. Calibration:
When required, the ACL Elite/Elite Pro prompts the user to perform a calibration.
Calibration is performed with commercially available calibration material either
prior to or simultaneously with sample analysis.
7. Quality Control:
Commercial quality control material is available for daily monitoring of the
instrument.
8. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and Software Development
processes for this line of product types:
