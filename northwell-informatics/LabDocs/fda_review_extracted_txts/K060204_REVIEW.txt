L. Test Principle:
The method for the qualitative determination of specific IgG to EBV viral antigens early
antigen-diffuse [EA(D)] recombinant polypeptide as an indirect chemiluminescence
immunoassay (CLIA). The principal components of the test are magnetic particles (solid
phase) coated with EBV synthetic peptides and a conjugate of mouse monoclonal
antibody to human IgG or linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-antibody
conjugate). During the first incubation, EA(D) antibodies present in calibrators, samples
or controls bind to the solid phase. During the second incubation, the antibody conjugate
reacts with EBV IgG antibodies that are already bound to the solid phase. After each
incubation, unbound material is removed with a wash cycle. Subsequently, the starter
reagents are added and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is thus induced. The light
signal, and hence the amount of isoluminol-antibody conjugate, is measured by a

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
This study was conducted at three external US laboratories and at the applicant
address (Stillwater, MN). A nine-member serum coded panel was prepared at
DiaSorin, Italy and provided to each site for testing by the applicant device
(LIAISON® EA IgG assay). Seven of the nine samples were selected or
prepared so as to exhibit a low- to mid-positive Analyte level (i.e. samples
demonstrating an expected analyte level approximately two to five times the
cutoff). All panel members were divided into aliquots and stored frozen prior to
testing. Samples EAS1-3 were tested at sites #1, #3, and #5, while EA1-6 were
tested at sites #2, #3, and #5. The same coded panel was tested at all three sites,
in three replicates per run for ten runs. LIAISON® EA IgG results were
expressed in U/ml. The mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation
(%CV) of the results were computed by the total and different components of
variability for each of the tested specimens for each of the sites and across sites..
The results are summarized in the following tables.

e. Analytical specificity:
The cross-reactivity studies for the LIAISON® EA IgG assay were designed to
evaluate potential interference from IgG immunoglobulins directed against
closely-related members of the herpes virus family (e.g. HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV,
CMV), from other organisms that may cause symptoms similar to EBV
(Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus) and from other conditions that may result
from atypical immune system activity (rheumatoid factor (RF)). Samples for
these studies were selected using commercially available devices.

f. Assay cut-off:
The cutoff for the LIAISON® EA IgG assay was determined during European
clinical trials in which 519 samples were run at two different sites. The samples
consisted of either single samples or serial panel from different selected
populations (subjects never infected by EBV, patients affected by primary EBV
infection, subjects with past EBV infection, patients with suspected EBV
reactivation and transplant recipients). The samples were tested in parallel with
the LIAISON® EA IgG assay and a commercially available ELISA assay as the
comparison method. Consensus with the serological data such as the combined
EBV patients was applied to define the expected results: 208 samples were
expected to be EA IgG positive and 291 samples were expected to be EA IgG
negative, while 20 specimens were equivocal either by the comparison method
or the original classification and therefore were not included in the data
analysis.
The analysis of the data determined that the best sensitivity and specificity
balance was obtained using a cutoff at 10 U/ml. Therefore, in the LIAISON®
EA IgG assay, a sample is defined as positive if the level is equal or greater than
10 U/ml, and defined as negative of the level is lower than 10 U/ml.
The selected cutoff was validated in the US clinical trials. To account for
observed assay imprecision, an equivocal zone was established about the cut-
off. A nominal equivocal zone of + 10% (dose) was assigned to this assay (for
more detail on the establishment of this zone, see the response to question 4 on
page 2 of 13 within the second deficiency response). Typical total imprecision
(%CV) across the range of the assay is approximately 10%. Based upon the
observed separation of the infected and non-infected patient responses, it is not
likely that a significant percentage of samples will be affected by the equivocal
zone. A total of 70 selected archive samples and 823 unselected prospectively
collected samples were tested in the US trials. The resulting data clearly
indicated separation for positive and negative results provided by the selected
cutoff.

Clinical Studies
The objective was to obtain sufficient data from a well-controlled clinical trial
to support the intended use statement and product claims. Specific objectives
were:
i. Evaluate the substantial equivalence of the LIAISON® EA IgG assay to an
FDA cleared method (DiaSorin ETI-EA-G; K992191).
ii. Describe the ability of the LIAISON® EA IgG assay to discriminate
between samples from subjects not previously infected by EBV and those
that have had either previous or current contact with EBV.
iii. Verify the precision of the assay using coded panels supplied by the
DiaSorin.
iv. Verify the quality control procedures of the assay using the LIAISON® EA
IgG Control Sera.
Four external US laboratories and DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN performed testing.

i. 460 residual specimens prospectively collected from non-selected subjects
that were sent to the laboratory for EBV testing. These were excess serum
drawn from patients for whom EBV testing was requested, with sufficient
volume to perform all testing required. Collection followed an IRB-
approved protocol, with a waiver of informed consent, as there was no link
to patient identity. The samples were stored frozen at –20oC prior to testing.
ii. 363 residual specimens prospectively collected from non-selected subjects
that were sent to the laboratory for heterophile antibody (Monospot) of VCA
IgM Testing. These were excess serum drawn from patients for whom EBV
testing was requested, with sufficient volume to perform all testing required.
Collection followed an IRB-approved protocol, with a waiver of informed
consent, as there was no link to patient identity. The samples were stored
frozen at –20oC prior to testing.
iii. 70 single samples from patients with serologic results suggesting an acute
EBV infection. The sample selection was based on a specific EBV
serological profile: VCA IgG positive, VCA IgM positive.
Study Analysis: LIAISON® EA IgG results were expressed in U/ml. Samples
returning values < 9.0 U/ml were classified as negative, samples between 9.0
and 10.9 U/ml as equivocal and those greater than > 11.0 U/ml as positive. The
DiaSorin ETI-EA-G kit is an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in
which the results were expressed in AU and the threshold for negative samples
is 20 AU. There is no equivocal zone in the predicate device. The performance
of the LIAISON® EA IgG assay was determined by the percent agreement
amount negative samples, percent agreement among positive samples, and
overall percent agreement with the reference method in specific populations.
The relevant 95% confidence limits were computed by applying the extract
method. Results are detailed below:
Retrospective Samples: 70 frozen archived (retrospective) single samples with
a serological pattern consistent with acute EBV infection (based on IgG and
IgM anti-VCA positive). The group was 50% female. Approximately 31% (22)
were below 18 years of age and the other 69% (48) ranged between 19 and 42
years of age. Comparison is identified below.

N. Proposed labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirement of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS:
1. For in vitro diagnostic use.
2. The human blood source material used to produce the components provided in
this kit is derived from donations found to be non-reactive for HBsAg,
antibodies to HCV, HIV-1 and HIV-2 when tested by an FDA-approved method
and found to be non-reactive for syphilis when tested by a serological test.
Because no test method can offer complete assurance that laboratory specimens
are pathogen-free, specimens should be handled at the Biosafety Level 2 as
recommended for any potentially infectious human serum or blood specimen in
the CDC-NIH manual, Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical
Laboratories, 4th Edition, May 1999, and CLSI Approved Guideline M29-A,
Protection of Laboratory Workers from Instrument Biohazards and Infectious
Disease Transmitted by Blood, Body Fluids, and Tissue (9, 10, 11).
3. Some reagents contain sodium azide as a preservative. Because sodium azide
may form explosive lead or copper azide in plumbing, it is recommended that
drains be thoroughly flushed with water after disposal of solutions containing
sodium azide.
4. Do not eat, drink, smoke or apply cosmetics in the assay laboratory.

5. Do not pipette solutions by mouth.
6. Avoid direct contact with all potentially infectious materials by using protective
clothing such as lab coats, protective glasses and disposable gloves. Wash hands
thoroughly at the end of each assay.
7. Avoid splashing or forming an aerosol. Any reagent spills should be washed
with a 5% sodium hypochlorite solution and disposed of as though potentially
infectious.
8. All samples, biological reagents and materials used in the assay must be
considered potentially able to transmit infectious agents. They should therefore
be disposed of in accordance with the prevailing regulations and guidelines of
the agencies holding jurisdiction over the laboratory, and the regulations of each
Country. Disposable materials must be incinerated; liquid waste must be
decontaminated with sodium hypochlorite at a final concentration of 5% for at
least 30 minutes. Any materials to be reused must be autoclaved using an
overkill approach (USP 24, 2000, p. 2143). A minimum of one hour at 121°C is
usually considered adequate, though the users must check the effectiveness of
their decontamination cycle by initially validating it and routinely using
biological indicators.
9. Specimens with elevated lipids (3000 mg/dL) may give erroneous results.
10. Assay interference due to circulating antibodies against Hepatitis A and
Hepatitis C viruses has not been evaluated. The user is responsible for
establishing cross-reactivity performance with these infectious agents.
11. Assay cross-reactivity has been noted with some specimens containing antibody
to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Reactive results must contain a
caution statement regarding possible cross-reactivity with HIV. HIV disease
must be excluded before confirmation of diagnosis.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted material in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
