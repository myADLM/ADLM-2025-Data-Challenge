c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Protocols and acceptance criteria for on-board and shelf life stability studies were
described and found to be acceptable.
ABX Pentra CO Control traceability
2
The ABX Pentra CO Control is gravimetrically prepared to a concentration of
2
20mmol/l sodium bicarbonate. The value of the ABX Pentra CO Control is
2
assigned using a biochemistry analyzer, e.g. Hitachi 911.
ABX Pentra CO Calibrator traceability
2
ABX Pentra CO Cal is made from a secondary reference material, traceable to
2
NIST 723c to a concentration of 30 mmol/l sodium bicarbonate. The Master Lot
is stored under the same conditions as a normal production lot, and has the same
expiration date: 15 months after production at 2-8°C. The target value is
determined by the median of all results yielded from the 6 devices (150
measurements/parameter).
d. Detection limit:
Method: Based upon the Valtec guideline (Vassault et al., Ann. Biol. Clin.,
1986, (44), 686-745)
Minimum Detection Limit (MDL) was calculated from 30 measurements of
saline water (0.9 g/l)
Formula : MDL = mean of measurements + 4.65 SD (mean of measurement =
0 when negative
Using the above criteria, the following minimum detection limits were
determined:
ABX PENTRA ALP CP - 6 U/L
20

--- Page 21 ---
ABX PENTRA Calcium CP - 0.16 Mg/dL
ABX PENTRA CO2 RTU - 1.8 mmol/L
ABX PENTRA Creatinine CP - 0.11 Mg/dL
ABX PENTRA Iron CP - 7.42 ųg/dL
ABX PENTRA Magnesium RTU - 0.17 Mg/dL
ABX PENTRA Phosphorus CP - 0.28 Mg/dL
ABX PENTRA Urea CP - 0.9 Mg/dL
ABX PENTRA Uric Acid CP - 0.19 Mg/dL
e. Analytical specificity:
Substances were added to pooled Human serum samples at two different
measurand concentrations (normal and high). The base serum with each
interfering substance was then serially diluted with the same base serum
containing saline instead of interfering substance to adjust for analyte
concentration.
Method: Based upon the Valtec guideline (Vassault et al., Ann. Biol. Clin.,
1986, (44), 686-745)
