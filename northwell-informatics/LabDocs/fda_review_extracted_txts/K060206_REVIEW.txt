I. Device Description:
The Mission CompleteTM Linearity Control are assayed materials used for confirming
the calibration and linearity of blood gas, electrolyte, and metabolite instruments
measuring pH, pCO , pO , Na+,K+, Cl-, Ca+2, glucose, and lactate. The device is
2 2
intended to confirm the calibration of an instrument. The device is not intended for
use as a calibrator.
The control material is provided in 5 levels of control chosen to cover the clinically
relevant range of each analyte. The control material is packaged in sealed glass
ampules. Each ampule contains 1.8 ml of solution. The material is stable for 3 years
if stored at 2-8 °C.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Blood gas, electrolyte, lactate, and BUN controls
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
k943754

L. Test Principle:
Not applicable.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable of a device of this type.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable of a device of this type.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The control material is prepared gravimetrically from analytic grade material.
CO and O are introduced into the solute by bubbling. Confirmation of the
2 2
analyte concentration is obtained through comparison to a NIST standard.
The company uses NIST 919a as reference material for Na+ and Cl-. For K+,

the company compares to NIST 918a. For Ca+2, the company compares to
NIST 915a. The company confirms the glucose concentration of their
controls by comparison to NIST 917b. The concentration of lactate is
obtained via comparison to a Pointe Lactate standard.
The company substantiated their claim for a 3 year shelf life via accelerated
aging studies. Samples demonstrated a change in concentration of less that +/-
5%, the acceptance criteria used by the company. The data supplied by the
company supports the 36 month shelf life if stored at 2-8 °C.
