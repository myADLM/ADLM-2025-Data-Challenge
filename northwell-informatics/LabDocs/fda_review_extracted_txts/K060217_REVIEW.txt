Negative ID/AST or AST only panel is intended for use with the BD Phoenix
Automated Microbiology System for the quantitative determination of

aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria belonging to the family
Enterobacteriaceae and non – Enterobacteriaceae and gram-positive bacteria
belonging to the genera Staphylococcus and Enterococcus.

This submission is for the addition of the antibiotics Moxifloxacin at 0.125 – 8
µg/mL on the Phoenix™ Gram Positive ID/AST or AST only panel, and
Ciprofloxacin at 0.25 – 4 µg/mL on the Phoenix™ Gram Negative ID/AST or

For prescription use only
Results for S. maltophilia with ciprofloxacin have been excluded in the BD
Phoenix™ therefore no results will be reported. An alternate method should be
performed when this combination is identified.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST
Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and
equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™
Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST broth, which contains an AST
indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST broth is a cation-adjusted formulation
of Mueller-Hinton broth containing 0.01% Tween 80. After adding the indicator solution
to the AST inoculum the color is blue and after inoculation and incubation goes to pink to
colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned
and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System instrument where
the panels are continuously incubated at 350C. The AST has a final inoculum of 5 x 105
CFU/ml. The instrument incubates, reads and records the results of the biochemical
substrates and antimicrobial agents and interprets the reactions to give an ID of the isolate
and MIC value and category interpretation of the antimicrobial agents. Organisms
growing in the presence of a given antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator, signaling
organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or inhibited
by a given antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do not
produce a color change. Additional interpretation is done using software driven

Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an AST result available between 4-16 hours.
This is only an autoread result; there are no manual readings possible.

organism growth.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S16) “Methods for
Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard.”
L. Test Principle:
The AST portion of the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth
based microdilution method that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-
reduction) to enhance detection of organism growth. The MIC is determined by
comparing growth in wells containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the
growth in “growth control wells” which contains no antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intersite and Intrasite testing demonstrated >95% reproducibility. The ten
isolate study described in the guidance document was used (10 organisms
tested 3 times on 3 days at 3 sites).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality Control was performed on every test occasion with the following
results. BD Phoenix™ produced acceptable QC results as compared to the
reference method results >95% of the time.
