3. Special condition for use statement(s):
Prescription Use Only
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST
Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and
equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™
Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST broth, which contains an AST
indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST broth is a cation-adjusted broth
containing Tween 80. After adding the indicator solution to the AST inoculum, the color
is blue, and after inoculation, incubation and organism growth, it changes to pink then
colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned
and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System instrument where
the panels are continuously incubated at 35°C. The resulting AST has a final inoculum
of 5 x 105 CFU/ml. The instrument incubates, reads and records the results of the
biochemical substrates and antimicrobial agents and interprets the reactions to give an ID
of the isolate and MIC value and category interpretation of the antimicrobial agents.
Organisms growing in the presence of a given antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator,
signaling organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or
inhibited by a given antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do
not produce a color change. Additional interpretation is done using software driven
“EXPERT” System using rules derived from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI). Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an ID result available
between 2-12 hours and an AST result available between 4-16 hours. This is only an
autoread result; there are no manual readings possible.
