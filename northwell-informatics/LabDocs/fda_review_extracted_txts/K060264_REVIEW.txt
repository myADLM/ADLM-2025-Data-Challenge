L. Test Principle:
Under acidic conditions, iron (Fe+++) bound to the protein transferrin is released. In
the presence of the reducing agent ascorbic acid, (Fe+++) is reduced to (Fe++). (Fe ++)
forms a blue complex with 3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-bis-2-(5-furyl sulfonic acid)-1,2,4-
triazine, disodium salt (Ferene® ). The absorbance of the complex, measured using a
bichromatic (600, 700 nm) endpoint technique, is directly proportional to the
concentration of transferrin-bound iron in the serum.
Fe+++ -- Transferrin → Fe+++ + Transferrin
2 Fe +++ + Ascorbic Acid → 2 Fe++ + Dehydroascorbic Acid + 2 H+
Fe++ + 3 Ferene® → Fe++ -- Ferene®3 complex (absorbs at 600 nm)
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Commercially available Bio-Rad Controls and serum and plasma pools were
analyzed in duplicate twice a day for 20 days in accordance with the
CLSI/NCCLS EP5-A2 Guidelines. All specific performance characteristic tests
were run after normal recommended equipment quality control checks were
performed on the Dimension® RxL clinical chemistry system. Five samples were
run externally at the Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis,
Missouri, using the Dimension® IRON method on the Dimension RxL® clinical
chemistry system. These samples are designated in the summary chart below
with an (E). Seven samples were run internally at Dade Behring research
laboratory facility located in Glasgow, Delaware using the Dimension® IRON
method on the Dimension RxL® clinical chemistry system. These samples are
designated in the summary chart below with an (I). The following sources of
variability existed at each of the testing locations: External Site (E): one
instrument, one operator, one reagent lot, one calibration interval, samples
analyzed n=1 in two separate cups twice a day for 20 days. Internal Site (I): one
instrument, one operator, one reagent lot, one calibration interval, samples
analyzed n=1 in two separate cups twice a day for 20 days. The repeatability and
within-lab precision coefficients of variation (%CV) were calculated by the
analysis of variance method according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) Guideline EP5- A2. The sponsors acceptance criteria for
Repeatability %CV is less than or equal to 3% and for Within-lab %CV the

these sites is shown in the table below.

hydrochloric acid then diluted with deionized water to a concentration of 5190
μg/dL. Test concentrations were prepared by dilution of this stock and then
sequential mixing to create equally spaced samples ranging from 0 to 2000 μg/dL
iron. The linearity of iron on the Dimension® RxL by the Dimension® IRON
assay was evaluated by comparing observed versus expected values across the
expected range. A linear regression analysis was performed on the data and
plotted. The observed linearity (using least squares regression analysis) gave the
following: Observed = 0.999(Expected) + 0.178; r = 0.9999 from 0 to 2000
μg/dL.

The assay range claim is 5 to 1000 μg/dL. The sponsor indicates that values
detected as >1000 μg/dL should be manually diluted according to the package
insert to obtain results within assay range.
To ascertain device performance over the clinically relevant levels between 5 to
250 μg/dL, data with values in this range from the method comparison study were
used (n=107). The observed least squares regression statistics were the following:
Observed = 1.003(Expected) – 2.64; r = 0.9986 from 9 to 251 μg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrator set points are traceable to NIST SRM 937. The calibrator was
approved under k060264 as a kit component required but not provided. The
shelf-life of the calibrator is 12 months.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity (limit of the blank) represents the lowest concentration
of iron that can be distinguished from zero. This analytical sensitivity was defined
as the mean value (n=20) plus two standard deviations of the Level 1 (0mg/L)
IRON Calibrator. The Level 1(0mg/L) IRON calibrator was run n=20 on one
Dimension® RxL clinical chemistry system using one reagent lot on one
instrument at both the 40uL and 25 uL sample size. The analytical sensitivity of
the IRON method is stated as 5 μg/dL using a 40 μL sample size and 5 μg/dL
using a 25 μL sample size.

e. Analytical specificity:
Dimension® IRON was evaluated for interference according to CLSI/NCCLS
EP7-A. Bias is the difference in the results between the control sample (without
the interferent) and the test sample (contains the interferent) expressed in percent.
The sponsor considered bias exceeding 10% to be interference. Iron dextran at a
concentration of 60 ug/mL increases the IRON result by 63 μg/dL at an IRON
concentration of 36 μg/dL [and by 69 μg/dL at an IRON concentration of 131
μg/dL. The following substances do not interfere with the IRON method when
present in serum in the amounts indicated. Systematic inaccuracies (bias) due to
these substances are less than 10% at an iron concentration of 26 to 38 μg/dL and
118 to 136 μg/dL.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 147 serum samples were run using the IRN and IRON methods on the
Dimension® RxL clinical chemistry system. Ninety-nine (99) individual native
serum patient samples were tested. Due to the difficulty to obtain native
individual samples containing iron concentrations that adequately span the entire
assay range of the Dimension IRON assay, some spiked samples were added to
the method comparison study. 48 different individual serum samples were spiked
with various amounts of NIST-937 reference iron material.
The distribution of samples included 10 visibly icteric and 10 visibly lipemic
samples. Samples containing hemoglobin have been identified as a known
interferent for the Dimension® IRON method and were not included in this study.
This limitation is described in the “Specimen Collection” section of the package
insert. The following represents the sample breakdown across the assay range.

50-150 µg/dL 51
150-300 µg/dL 18
300-1000 µg/dL 37
Total 147
Linear regression analysis gave the following relationship:
Device = 0.980(Predicate) – 0.488; r = 0.9996
b. Matrix comparison:
One hundred and twenty nine (129) matched sets of serum and plasma specimens

were analyzed to estimate bias between serum and either lithium or sodium
heparin plasma sample types.
Serum and heparinized (lithium or sodium heparin) plasma are the recommended
specimens for the Dimension® Automated iron (IRON) assay (DF85). In order to
compare specimen types with analyte values that span the assay range, fifty (50)
of the samples were spiked with varying amounts of FeCl .

No clinically significant difference was observed between serum and plasma
samples. Results are summarized in the table below.
Comparison Slope Y-Intercept r
Serum vs Na heparin plasma 0.988 0.804 0.999
Serum vs Li heparin plasma 0.985 1.42 0.999
Li heparin vs Na heparin plasma 1.00 -0.590 0.9997
To determine the effect of freezing and thawing on iron in 20 serum and 20
lithium hepranized plasma samples, samples were run fresh, in duplicate, on the
Dimension® RxL clinical chemical system. The samples were frozen, thawed
and then run in duplicate on the Dimension® RxL clinical chemical system. A
bias was calculated by subtracting the mean of the frozen results from the mean of
fresh results. The average bias for both serum and lithium heparinized samples
was -2. No statistical difference was observed for either serum or plasma.

a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The reference range for total iron is indicated to be:
Males: 65-175 μg/dL [11.6-31.3 μmol/L]
Females: 50-170 μg/dL [9.0- 30.4 μmol/L]

Normal reference intervals can differ by as much as 35% between commercial
iron methods, therefore the sponsor advises customers that each laboratory
establish its own expected values for iron as performed on the Dimension®
system.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
