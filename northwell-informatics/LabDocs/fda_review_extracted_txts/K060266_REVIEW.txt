b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrator set points are traceable to NIST SRM 937.
Calibrator shelf life was determined by comparing results of three different
lots of the product stored at 2-8°C with product stored at -20°C over 13
months. Product was stored at 2-8 °C throughout testing cycle and tested at
month 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 18, 24, 25 (using 5 replicates per calibrator
level). The control material was stored at -20 °C and tested at the same
frequency. Stress testing was also performed using one lot of product stored
at 2 -8 °C throughout testing cycle and tested at days 7, then months 6,7,12
and 13 (using 5 replicates per calibrator level) under hot (stressed shipping)
conditions ((a) Store product at 30°C for 36 h, 35°C for 12h, then 45°C for 4 h
then stored long term at 4°C. (b) Store product at 25°C for 48h, then 30°C for
6 h then store long term at 4°C. (c) Store product at 15°c for 54h, then store
long term at 4°C.) and cold (stressed shipping) conditions (three freeze/thaw
cycles then stored long-term @ 4°C). Calibrator shelf life was determined by
comparing results of the product stored at 4°C with product stored at -20°C to
ensure that analytical system drift is dissociated with calibrator drift. The drift
at each test level must meet the following sponsor-set criteria:
Less than or equal to 5ug/dL for Level 1 (0 μg/dL)
Less than or equal to 5% CV Level 2 (500 μg/dL) and
Less than or equal to 8% CV for level 3 (1075 μg/dL).
Using this criteria, the sponsor claims the time frame which the criteria are
met and applies that time frame as the stability for unopened product stored at
2-8°C.
The Dimension® IRON Calibrator is in a single-use glass ampule product.
According to the Dimension® IRON Calibrator Instructions for Use, opened
ampules should be used immediately and any portion not used should be
discarded. As such, no “Opened Product” stability studies were performed.
The target concentrations will be 0, 500 and 1075 μg/dL. This strategy
supports a preference by the customer to have an assay range that is never
lower than the lowest level of calibrator and never higher than the highest
level of calibrator in order to be in compliance accrediting agencies and
demonstrate linearity with each lot of reagent. The intermediate level was
chosen based on a level to achieve the best linear curve fit.
Assay Range: 5 – 1000 μg/dL
