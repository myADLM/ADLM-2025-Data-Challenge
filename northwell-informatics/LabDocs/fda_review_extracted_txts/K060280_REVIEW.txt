510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
k060280
B. Purpose for Submission:
Modified 510(k): The sponsor wishes to establish clear ownership of their earlier cleared test
system which will now be marketed under a new name. Additionally, the analyzer software
was modified since the initial clearance of the product.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Iris Diagnostics facility in Marburg, Germany, iChem 100 Urine Chemistry Analyzer
(IRIS is an abbreviation for International Remote Imaging Systems.)
D. Type of Test(s) Performed:
Qualitative and Semi-quantitative urine chemistry assays
E. System Description
1. Device Description:
This is a semi-automated benchtop instrument, intended exclusively for use with the
sponsors earlier cleared test strips (k030600). Components include a keyboard, transport
mechanism, display screen, printer, and barcode reader.
Test strips are manually dipped into the urine sample and placed on the instrument
transport belt. The strip is transported into the instrument where readings of each
chemistry are taken at timed intervals. Readings are converted to concentrations which
are displayed to the operator. There are also options to print results or to transmit them to
a Laboratory Information System.
2. Principles of Operation:
The technology utilized in the instrument is reflectance spectroscopy. The reflectance
densitometer reads at three wavelengths; 450, 530, and 625 nm. Instead of using a
photodiode detector to measure the reflected light, the instrument utilizes a
complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor. This technology is
1

--- Page 2 ---
well established and is the same as the sponsor’s earlier cleared instrument.
3. Modes of Operation:
The instrument allows both batch and stat modes.
4. Specimen Identification:
Specimens are identified by a barcode reader or by manual input via the keyboard. A
work list can also be created by the operator.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The iChem reagent strip is manually dipped into a urine specimen then placed on the
instrument transport belt. All steps that follow are automatically controlled by the
instrument’s software.
6. Calibration:
No external calibration strips or procedures are required. Prior to each measurement the
device is calibrated using a one-point optics alignment calibration. If readings fall
outside of acceptable limits, a secondary standard is moved into place to perform a two-
point calibration. The approach to calibration is appropriate for the CMOS image sensor
technology.
7. Quality Control (QC):
A control file may be set up by the operator to record the lot and expiration of the control
material, and to establish the frequency for running controls. The software also allows
manual microscopic examination results to be entered into the system.
Commercially available control materials (negative and known positive concentrations)
are recommended for use according to local, state, and federal regulatory guidelines.
Specific controls are not identified.
8. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
Two levels of commercially available control (normal and abnormal concentrations of
each analyte) were analyzed to estimate precision of the test system. Testing was
performed in the sponsor’s own laboratory by their employees.
To estimate total imprecision, 23 abnormal samples and 20 normal samples were run over
a 13 day period. To estimate within-run imprecision 20 normal and 20 abnormal samples
were analyzed in a single run. Testing was performed on the candidate device, and the
candidate device prior to the software modifications. Testing was done in the sponsor’s
laboratory by trained laboratory technicians.

See the method comparison section above for performance of spiked
samples with the other analytes.
d. Carryover:
There are no apparent carryover issues with this test system/ instrument. Strips are
unitized devices. They are manually dipped, with excess liquid being removed. Strips
are then placed in a horizontal position for analysis. There is little chance for run over,
and no problems were observed during studies.
e. Interfering Substances:
Because test strips have not been changed, and only minor modifications have been made
to the instrument which should not affect performance, these studies were not repeated.
