L. Test Principle:
According to the sponsor the Abbott Carbon Dioxide Reagent is a quantitative
enzymatic assay based on the PEP Carboxylase methodology. Carbon Dioxide, as
bicarbonate (HCO -), and phospho (enol) pyruvate (PEP) are converted to oxalacetate
3
and phosphate in the reaction catalyzed by phosphor (enol) pyruvate Carboxylase
(PEPC). Malate dehydrogenase (MDH) catalyzes the reduction of oxalacetate to
malate with the concomitant oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NADH) analog. The resulting decrease in absorbance at 404 nm is proportional to
the CO content in the sample.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To determine the within-run, between-run, between-day, and total precision of the
Carbon Dioxide assay on the AEROSET and ARCHITECT c8000 Systems, the total
precision as well as the precision for each component of variation (between-day,
between-run, and within-run) was estimated in accordance with CLSI EP5-A. The
sponsor indicated that two control levels (Level 1 and Level 2) at normal and
abnormal analyte concentrations were tested. These controls were evaluated over 20
days, two runs per day, and two replicates per run. The sponsor determined that
precision was considered acceptable if the total SD is < 1 mEq/L or total %CV is
< 5.5%, whichever is greater. Precision was reported as the total percent CV. The
precision results are summarized in the below tables.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor indicated that the linear range of analyte concentrations of the Carbon
Dioxide assay on the AEROSET and ARCHITECT c8000 Systems linearity was
evaluated in accordance with a modified protocol based on CLSI EP6-A. Ten (10)
samples at various concentrations spanning the desired linear range of the assay were
run in four replicates. At least one level was included which exceeded the desired
linear range. The percent recovery for each sample was determined by dividing the
mean observed result by the predicted value. Results are presented below.

The data generated above indicate the Carbon Dioxide assay is linear from 5 to 50
mEq/L (mmol/L), with recovery within + 4.3% or ± 1 mEq/L of the predicted value
with 95% confidence.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
The reagent calibration stability was determined by the recovery method on multiple
lots of Carbon Dioxide reagent. Fresh reagent was calibrated with fresh calibrators on
Day 0. Control material (normal and abnormal) and a prepared test sample near the
linear high were analyzed on Day 0, 2, 7, 14, 15, and 17. The sponsor’s acceptance
criteria for recovery on each day are the Mean value of the samples < 4.3% or < 1
mEq/L, whichever is greater, of the Day 0 results. All test points up to and including
Day 17 met the target for recovery. The resulting calibration stability claim is 14
days.
The reagent open onboard stability was also determined by the recovery method on
multiple lots of Carbon Dioxide reagent. Fresh reagent was calibrated with fresh
calibrators on Day 0. Control material (normal and abnormal) and a prepared test
sample near the linear high were analyzed on Day 0, 2, 7, 14, 15, and 17 without
recalibration. Day 17 testing was repeated after re-calibration with both the onboard
and fresh reagent.
All test points up to and including Day 17 met the target for recovery. The resulting
open on-board stability claim is 14 days. The sponsor claims a product shelf-
life/expiration of 12 months. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed.

d. Detection limit:
The sponsor determined the Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) on the AEROSET and the
ACHITECT c8000 Systems. The LOQ is the analytical concentration at which the
CV = 20%. An internal verification study by the sponsor produced a CV of 10.5% at
a CO concentration of 3.7 mEq/L (3.7 mmol/L).
2
The Limit of Detection (LOD) testing for Carbon Dioxide was performed using a
study design based on CLSI EP17-A. An internal verification study by the sponsor
produced an LOD for Carbon Dioxide of 1.5 mEq/L (1.5 mmol/L). The proportions
of false positives (α) and false negatives (β) were less than 5% and the limit of blank
(LOB) was 1.3 mEq/L (1.3 mmol/L).
The sponsors claim an LOQ of 4 mEq/L and an LOD of 2 mEq/L for the Carbon
Dioxide assay.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor conducted studies to evaluate interferences in the Carbon Dioxide assay
caused by bilirubin, hemoglobin, and intralipid on the AEROSET and ARCHITECT
c8000 Systems. Interference effects were assessed at medical decision levels of the
analyte. Human serum samples (reference) at two Carbon Dioxide concentrations
(Lower Decision Level and Upper Decision Level) were spiked with various levels of
interferents.
According to the sponsor, four replicates of each interferent level and four replicates
of reference sample were run. The percent recovery was determined by dividing the
mean result of replicates for each interferent level by the mean result of the replicates
of the reference sample. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria were the level of
interference was considered acceptable if there was no more than ± 4.3% or ± 1
mEq/L, whichever greater, difference between the interferent result and the reference
result.
Testing was performed using the AEROSET System. The tables below summarize the
results for serum samples at each level, indicating the highest interferent
concentration at which the degree of interference was within ± 4.3% or ± 1 mEq/L.

Twenty-six (26) subjects were tested using each of the collection tubes to be
evaluated. The serum tube used for the baseline was the only glass tube; all other
specimen tubes were plastic. Data were analyzed for statistical differences between
different tube types. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria were acceptability of each
anticoagulant is based on a difference of less than ± 4.3% or + 1 mEq/L, whichever is
greater, between the mean values of all samples / replicates for each tube type in
question and the plain glass serum tube.
Testing was performed using the AEROSET System. The table below summarizes the
