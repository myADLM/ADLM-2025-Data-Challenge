--- Page 2 ---
1. Intended use(s):
Vancomycin at concentrations of 0.25 to 64 µg/mL on the MicroScan® Synergies
plus ™ Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel is intended for use with MicroScan®
Synergies plus™ Panels read on the WalkAway® -SI System (including upgraded
WalkAway® -40 or WalkAway® -96 to meet WalkAway® SI equivalence).
MicroScan® panels are designed for use in testing colonies, grown on solid
media, of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-positive cocci;
the panels also provide quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent
susceptibility for staphylococci and enterococci.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The addition of vancomycin at concentrations of 0.25 to 64 µg/mL to the gram-
positive test panel for testing Staphylococcus and Enterococcus spp. at < 16 hours
or >16 hours for an overnight reading.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
• S. aureus isolates with MICs of 8 – 16 µg/mL on MicroScan® Synergies
plus™ Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panels will be incubated for 16-18 hours
for overnight instrument or visual reporting of vancomycin.
• MicroScan® Synergies plus ™ Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel detects
vancomycin resistance in the VRSA S. aureus strains available at the time of
comparative testing. The ability of the MicroScan® Synergies plus ™ Gram-
Positive MIC/Combo Panel to detect resistance in other S. aureus strains is
unknown due to the limited number of resistant strains available for
comparative testing.
• Turbidity method of inoculum preparation only.
• For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
Each panel contains two control wells: a negative control well, and a growth control
well (contains test medium without antibiotic). Antibiotics are diluted in water,
buffer, or minute concentrations of broth to selected concentrations prior to
dehydration of the panels. The panel is rehydrated and inoculated at the same time
with 0.1 ml of suspension prepared by the turbidity method (inoculum prepared in
0.4% saline with PLURONIC®, then 0.1ml transferred to 25ml of inoculum
Synergies plus Pos Broth with PLURONIC®) for a final inoculum concentration of
3-7 X 105 CFU/ml. Panels are incubated in a Walk-Away® System and read
periodically starting at 4.5 hours until sufficient growth to determine the MIC.
Alternately the panels may be incubated at 35o C in a non-CO for 16-24 hours and

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) M7 (M100-S16) “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
The WalkAway® SI uses a Colorimetric Optics System consisting of a color
wheel/lamp assembly and a Photosensor. There is an initial read at 2.5 hours with a
possible final read at 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 8, 12, 16, or 18 hours (overnight instrument
readings, manual readings) depending on the growth rate of the organism being
tested. The time of final read is dependent on the growth rate of the organism and
the sensitivity of the automatic reader since cell densities below 2 x 107 cells/ml are
not detected.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates tested at 3 sites on 3
separate days in triplicate. The study included the testing on the WalkAway®
SI read at <16 hours, WalkAway® >16 hour readings and manual readings at
>16 hour incubation. All results were >95% reproducible.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC isolates, S. aureus ATCC 29213 and E. faecalis ATCC
29212 were tested a sufficient number of times with acceptable results on all
testing days with the reference method. The E. faecalis ATCC 29212 isolates
grew in the range of 6.5 – 24 hours read times while all QC results of S.
aureus ATCC 29213 grew in the 4.5-16 hour window on the Synergies Plus.
Quality control results demonstrated the ability of the different reading
parameters (manual and instrument) to produce acceptable results.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical testing was conducted at 3 sites using fresh isolates supplemented
with stock isolates. A total of 549 gram positive Enterococci and
Staphylococci were tested of which 476 were fresh isolates and 73 were stock
isolates. There were 78 challenge isolates tested which included the 3 VRSA
(Vancomycin Resistant S. aureus). All challenge isolates were tested at one
site with the exception of the 3 VRSA (Vancomycin Resistant S. aureus)
which were tested at a different site. These challenge isolates were compared
to the reference broth dilution result mode that was determined by previous
testing of each isolate multiple times in the recommended reference panel.
The Synergies plus™ readings were obtained between 4.5 and 16 hours of
incubation for > 90% of the results. An additional comparison was done with

readings on the instrument after overnight incubation and also read manually
when incubated >16 hours. Performance by these alternate reading methods
was also acceptable. The recommended CLSI reference method was
followed with the exception of the use of a small amount (0.1%)
PLURONIC® in the final inoculum. A validation of the use of PLURONIC®
in the frozen reference panels was conducted. Similar calculations for the
different reading methods were performed with very little difference. The test
device had a no growth rate of <10%.
The charts below demonstrated the performance of all three reading methods
(Synergies plus™ readings at <16 hours, > 16 hours on the WalkAway® and
manually read at >16 hours using the touchScan®-SR) with the long dilution
sequence when compared to the reference method.

Evaluable results are those that fall within the test range of the reference
method and could also be on-scale with the new device if within the
plus/minus one dilution variability. EA is when there is agreement
between the reference method and the MicroScan® within plus or minus
one serial two-fold dilution of antibiotic. CA is when the interpretation of
the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the
MicroScan® result.
The <16 Hour Read Method had 42 isolates that did not grow in 16 hours

for a no growth rate of 7.7% (48/627) but provided results at >16 hour.
There appears to be a slight trend where the test device is more resistant
than the reference device as reflected in the number of maj errors for each
read method. This observation was also noted in the QC organisms where
results are at the higher end of the expected range.
