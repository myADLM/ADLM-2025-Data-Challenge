686-745); 2 controls and 3 specimens of low, medium and high concentrations
were tested 20 times in a single run for each sample.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies across the measuring range of the assay were performed via
protocols based upon CLSI EP6-A. The studies demonstrated linearity of the
assays and the linear regression statistics listed below. In addition, post
dilution studies were performed to validate the automated dilution function
and range.
ABX PENTRA AST CP
The measuring range of the assay is 4 – 600 U/L; Post dilution up to 1800
U/L.
Linear regression statistics: y = 1.0133x + 1.2633 r2 = 0.9998
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
ABX PENTRA AST CP
Reagent Shelf-life: Real time stability of the reagent stored at 2-8°C has been
evaluated on 3 different lots. Results support a real time stability of at least 24
months.
Reagent Stability on board: Reagent stability on-board has been evaluated by
testing accuracy and linearity periodically. From the results, the reagent
stability on-board (refrigerated area) after opening is 55 days.
ABX PENTRA N Control & ABX PENTRA P Control traceability
The values of the ABX PENTRA Controls are assigned from the ABX
PENTRA calibrator, reagents and analyzers. The target value is determined by
the median of results from 150 measurements/parameter. Confidence range is
determined as the calculated range in percent which is based on the
experimental results from the previous target value trials. The range declared
in the target value sheet is equal to the assigned value +/- 3 standard
deviations (3 SD).

ABX Pentra Multical is prepared from reference materials. Commercial
calibrators are standardized by means of a Master Lot which is stored at -
80°C. Two controls are used to ensure that the calibration values of the
Master Lot, as well as the entire measurement system (calibrator, reagent, and
analyzer), remain stable during the storage period. The target value is
determined by the median of results from 150 measurements/parameter.
ABX PENTRA N Control, ABX PENTRA P Control, and ABX PENTRA
Multical
Protocols and acceptance criteria for open and closed stability of the controls
and calibrators were described and found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
ABX PENTRA AST CP
Minimum Detection Limit (MDL) was calculated from 30 measurements of
saline water (0.9 g/l) using the Valtec guideline (Vassault et al., Ann. Biol.
Clin., 1986, (44), 686-745).. The claimed MDL value is 4 U/l.
e. Analytical specificity:
ABX PENTRA AST CP
Hemoglobin up to 95 mg/dl, total bilirubin up to 24.7 mg/dl (415 mmol/L),
direct bilirubin up to 20.3mg/dl (362 mmol/L) and triglycerides (as Intralipid
®, representative of lipemia) up to 4.6 mmol/l (402.5 mg/dl) do not interfere
with AST determination by this test.
Study materials: Substances were added to pooled Human serum at two
different AST activities (normal and high). The base serum with each
substance was then serially diluted with the same base serum that was added
saline instead of substance to adjust AST activity.
Method : Based upon the Valtec guideline (Vassault et al., Ann. Biol. Clin.,
1986, (44), 686-745)

--- Page 8 ---
A total of 103 samples were compared with the Roche Direct AST Bilirubin
reagent (predicate) on the Roche MIRA Plus. Regression statistics were as
follows:
y = 0.9654x + 4.0431, r2 = 0.9963
Additional studies were performed to provide complementary data covering
the low end of the AST assay range.
Sample range 3.6 – 9.6 U/L, n=10, y=0.8821x=1.3841, r2=0.9183.
b. Matrix comparison:
To demonstrate equivalence of AST in serum and Plasma Heparin-Lithium
samples, comparison study was performed. 43 samples were evaluated on
ABX Pentra 400 analyzer using ABX Pentra AST CP reagent. Y = 0.9927x +
0.4334 r2 = 0.9979. The results show that there is no significant difference
between serum specimens and Heparin-Lithium Plasma.
