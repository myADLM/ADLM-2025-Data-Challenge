ABX PENTRA Bilirubin Direct CP
Reagent Shelf-life: Real time stability of the reagent stored at 2-8°C has been
evaluated on 3 different lots. Results support a real time stability of 18 months.
Reagent Stability on board: Reagent stability on-board has been evaluated testing
accuracy and linearity periodically. The results support reagent stability on-board
(refrigerated) after opening of 25 days.

ABX PENTRA N Control & ABX PENTRA P Control traceability
The values of the ABX PENTRA Controls are assigned from the ABX PENTRA
calibrator, reagents and analyzers. The target value is determined by the median of
results from 150 measurements/parameter. Confidence range is determined as the
calculated range in percent which is based on the experimental results from the
previous target value trials. The range declared in the target value sheet is equal to
the assigned value +/- 3 standard deviations (3 SD).
ABX Pentra Multical traceability
ABX Pentra Multical is prepared from reference materials. Commercial calibrators
are standardized by means of a master lot which is stored at -80°C. Two controls are
used to ensure that the calibration values of the master lot, as well as the entire
measurement system (calibrator, reagent, and analyzer), remain stable during the
storage period. The target value is determined by the median of results from 150
measurements/parameter.

Protocols and acceptance criteria for open and closed stability of the controls and

d. Detection limit:
ABX PENTRA Bilirubin Direct CP
Minimum Detection Limit (MDL) was calculated from 30 measurements of saline
water (0.9 g/l) using the Valtec guideline (Vassault et al., Ann. Biol. Clin., 1986,
(44), 686-745). The claimed MDL value is 0.69 mg/dl.
ABX Pentra Bilirubin, Total CP
Minimum Detection Limit (MDL) was calculated from 30 measurements of saline
water (0.9 g/l) using the Valtec guideline (Vassault et al., Ann. Biol. Clin., 1986,
(44), 686-745). The claimed MDL value is 0.20 mg/dl.
e. Analytical specificity:
ABX PENTRA Bilirubin Direct CP
Study materials: Hemoglobin and triglycerides (as Intralipid ®, representative of
lipemia) were added to pooled Human serum at two different direct bilirubin
concentrations (normal and high). The base serum with each substance was then
serially diluted with unspiked base serum to adjust direct bilirubin concentration.
Method: Based upon the Valtec guideline (Vassault et al., Ann. Biol. Clin., 1986,
(44), 686-745); specimens of low, medium and high concentrations were tested 20
times in a single run for each sample.
Due to hemoglobin interference, hemolyzed samples should not be used.
ABX Pentra Bilirubin, Total CP
Study materials: Hemoglobin up to 220 µmol/L (380 mg/dL) and triglycerides (as
Intralipid ®, representative of lipemia) up to 7 mmol/L (612.5 mg/dL) were added to
pooled Human serum at two different direct bilirubin concentrations (normal and
high). The base serum with each substance was then serially diluted with unspiked
base serum to adjust direct bilirubin concentration
Method: Method: Based upon the Valtec guideline (Vassault et al., Ann. Biol. Clin.,
1986, (44), 686-745); specimens of low, medium and high concentrations were
tested 20 times in a single run for each sample.
Hemoglobin up to 220 µmol/L (380 mg/dL) and triglycerides (as Intralipid ®,
representative of lipemia) up to 7 mmol/L (612.5 mg/dL) do not interfere with total
bilirubin determination by this test.
