H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Refer to Indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:

The MEDTOX® OXYCODONE assay provides only a preliminary analytical
test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to
obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
(GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result.
3. Special condition for use statement(s):
The MEDTOX® OXYCODONE provides only a preliminary analytical test
result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to
obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
(GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result.
The assay is intended for prescription use in point-of-care settings.
Tests for oxycodone cannot distinguish between abused drugs and certain
prescribed medications.
Certain foods or medications may interfere with tests for oxycodone and cause
false positive results.
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Not applicable. The device is a visually read single-use device.
I. Device Description:
The product is a single-use device in a cassette format. The device includes the
immunochromatographic strip enclosed in plastic, a plastic dropper for dispensing
urine, and the package insert. At one end is the sample well where the urine sample
is applied. The test reaction is initiated by movement of the sample through the test
strip. In the middle of the device is a read window with a test line for oxycodone and
a control line. Above the read window are interpretations for negative or non-
negative for the test line and valid or invalid for the control line.
Description of the test antibody: monoclonal mouse antibody against oxycodone.
Description of the control line antibody: rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
The sponsor did not reference any standards in this submission.
L. Test Principle:
The test employs lateral flow immunochromatographic technology.
Drug in the sample and drug-labeled conjugate (containing a chromagen) compete for
antibody binding sites in the test area of the test strip. Binding of drug in the sample
causes the absence of a line at the test area, i.e., a positive result. When drug is not
present in the sample, the drug-labeled conjugate binds at the test line, resulting in
formation of a line, i.e., a negative result. The absence or presence of the line is
determined visually by the operator.
The device also has an internal process control which indicates that an adequate
volume of sample has been added and that the immunochromatographic strip is intact.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. The assay is intended for qualitative use.
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
External control materials are recommended but are not specifically
identified in the labeling.
The device has an internal process control. Users are instructed to
follow federal, state, and local guidelines when determining when to
run external controls.
d. Detection limit:
Sensitivity of this assay is characterized by validating performance
around the claimed cutoff concentration (100 ng/mL) of the assay,
including a determination of the lowest concentration of drug that is
capable of producing a positive result.
This information appears in the precision section, above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking various concentrations of
similarly structured drug compounds into drug-free urine. By
analyzing various concentration of each compound the sponsor
determined the concentration of the drug that produced a response
approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay.
Results of those studies appear in the table(s) below:

The following compounds were evaluated for potential positive
and/or negative interference with the assay. To evaluate for
interference the sponsor prepared two control samples that consisted
of drug-free urine spiked with 25 ng/mL (to test for positive
interference) and 150 ng/mL (to test for negative interference) of
oxycodone. Next, 100 µg/mL of all of the potentially interfering
compounds were added to separate aliquots of the control samples
and analyzed. There were no deviations from the expected results
for the following compounds:
Acetylsalicylic Acid Doxylamine
Acetaminophen Dextromethorphan
Brompheniramine 5,5 Diphenylhydantoin
Caffeine Ibuprofen
Carbamazepine Phenobarbital
Chlorpheniramine d-Pseudoephedrine

There is the possibility that other substances and/or factors not listed
above may interfere with the test and cause false results, e.g., technical or
procedural errors.
To test for potential positive/and or negative interference from
endogenous conditions the sponsor performed the following studies:
To assess the effects of pH on the assay, the sponsor prepared samples
from a pH of 4-9 and then to separate aliquots spiked in oxycodone at
concentrations of 25 and 150 ng/mL. There were no deviations from the
expected results.
The sponsor did a similar study with specific gravity values of 1.003,
1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025, 1.030, and 1.035 with urine samples
spiked at 25 and 150 ng/mL. There were no deviations from the expected
results.
For other endogenous substances, the sponsor performed a study which
tested for positive interference only. It is noted that these compounds
were spiked into drug-free urine (zero concentration oxycodone) only.
The following table lists the compounds, the concentration that was spiked
into drug-free urine, and the result.

f. Assay cut-off:
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
(SAMHSA) has not recommended a cutoff concentration for
oxycodone. The sponsor’s claimed cutoff is 100 ng/mL.
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the
claimed cutoff concentration appears in the precision section, above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The candidate device was compared both to a reference method,
GC/MS, and to the predicate device.
A total of 161 samples (116 negative and 45 positive) were evaluated
by the candidate device and by GC/MS and/or the predicate device.
Sample description: Unaltered clinical urine samples were evaluated.
37 additional diluted samples were also included in the study. The
samples were prepared by diluting clinical samples with high drug
concentrations with drug-free urine. This was done in order to
obtain samples near the cutoff concentration of the assay, because
the sponsor was not able to obtain unaltered samples near the cutoff.
Sample selection: Samples previously analyzed by the predicate
device were selected to be analyzed by the candidate device.
Samples were chosen for the study based on whether they screened
positive or negative by the predicate device.
Only those samples found positive by the predicate device were
analyzed by GC/MS. A portion of samples having drug
concentrations that were below the cutoff concentration of the assay
were also evaluated by GC/MS.
The study included an adequate number of samples that contained
drugs near to the cutoff concentration of the assay. Approximately
10% of the study samples are evenly distributed between plus and
minus 50% of the claimed cutoff concentration
Number of study sites: three

The sponsor also performed a method comparison study at their own
facility using many of the same samples as in the POC study above.
Results between the two studies were similar.
