See Indications for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
Calibrators
The Architect Insulin Calibrators are for the calibration of the Architect i System
when used for the quantitative determination of human insulin in human serum
and plasma.
Controls
The Architect Insulin Controls are for the verification of the accuracy and
precision of the Architect i System when used for the quantitative determination
of human insulin in human serum or plasma.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Architect i System
I. Device Description:
Calibrators
The Architect Insulin Calibrators consist of six calibrators (A-F). Calibrator A
contains acetate buffer. Calibrators B-F contain insulin in acetate buffer. The
calibrators are preserved by sodium azide and other antimicrobial agents. Each
Insulin Calibrator kit contains 6 bottles of Calibrators (4.0 mL fill volume) at the
following Insulin concentrations: 0, 3, 10, 100 and 300 μU/mL.
Controls
The Architect Insulin Controls contain insulin prepared in acetate buffer. The controls
are preserved by sodium azide and other antimicrobial agents. Each Insulin Control
kit contains 3 bottles of controls (Low, Medium and High) at the following
concentrations: 8, 40, and 120 μU/mL.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The primary calibrators and controls were manufactured from the WHO
Insulin 1st International Reference Preparation (IRP) 66/304. The Architect
Insulin Calibrators and Controls were manufactured by matching to the
primary calibrators and controls. Relative light unit (RLU) testing was
performed on the Architect i system and RLU values were compared to the
corresponding primary calibrators and controls. The sponsor’s acceptance
criteria: RLU variation between the Architect Insulin Calibrators and
Controls and the primary calibrators and controls must be within +/- 1.5%.
The sponsor’s studies show that the Architect Calibrators and Controls are
stable for 12 months when stored at 2-8˚C. Protocols and acceptance criteria
for stability testing were described and found to be acceptable.
