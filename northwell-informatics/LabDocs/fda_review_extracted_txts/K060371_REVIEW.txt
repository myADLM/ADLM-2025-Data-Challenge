For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable (N/A)
I. Device Description:
The calibrators contain tacrolimus in preserved whole blood hemolysate. The
calibrator kit consists of one vial of each calibrator level with target
concentrations of 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 30 ng/mL of tacrolimus.
The calibrators contain human blood components. Each lot was tested and found
to be non-reactive for Hepatitis B Suface Antigen (HBsAg), Antibody to Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV 1/2), Antibody to Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and
Antibody to Syphilis.

Assay. The Abbott Calibrators are prepared in preserved human whole blood with preservatives.
There are 6 calibrator levels with nominal values of 0, 3, 6, 12, 20 and 30 ng/mL tacrolimus.
Similarites
Both devices are calibrators intended for use as a reference in measuring tacrolimus with their
respective assays.
Both devices contain tacrolimus in preserved whole blood hemolysate.
Both devices contain 6 levels of calibrators.
Differences
The Emit® 2000 Tacrolimus Calibrators consist of 6 calibrator materials with concentrations of – 0,
2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 30 ng/mL while the Abbott IMx® Tacrolimus II Calibrators consist of 6 calibrator
materials with concentrations of – 0, 3, 6, 12, 20, and 30 ng/mL.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The tacrolimus frozen liquid stock solution was prepared gravimetrically from
commercially available pharmaceutical grade tacrolimus. Calibrators are
prepared by directly spiking the stock solution into whole blood hemolysate to
form the target concentrations. Verification occurred via recovery against a
master lot. The master lot is formulated by diluting the stock into the whole
blood hemolysate with the preservatives at six different levels and stored at
20°C. The potential master lot of calibrators is assigned by multiple runs
using the Emit Tacrolimus Assay calibrated with the existing master lot of
calibrators verified by LC/MS.
Shelf-life and open vial stability was conducted using real-time data from 3
lots of calibrators. Each level of calibrators was tested in duplicate and
replicates of 6 with commercially available control material. The calibrators
(stored at -20°C) were tested at 0,1,2,3,7,9,13,15,22,25,31 and 37 months. An
open vial stability (stored at 9°C) study was conducted at 0, 8 and 12 weeks.
Verification of the 8 week open vial stability throughout the 36 month shelf
life, the open vial stability was repeated from 7 to 37 months at 6 month
intervals. The study results support the sponsors 8 week open vial and 36
month shelf life stability.
