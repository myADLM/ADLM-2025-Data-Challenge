L. Test Principle:
The BD FACSCanto system for six-color immunophenotyping consists of a BD
FACSCanto flow cytometer, BD Multitest 6-color TBNK reagent, BD Trucount
tubes, a Windows-based PC workstation, BD FACSCanto clinical software version
2.0 for automated acquisition and analysis.
Determining lymphocyte subset percentages and absolute counts requires: (1)
obtaining a whole blood sample; (2) cell-surface antigen staining with the six-color
monoclonal antibody reagent in a BD Trucount tube; (3) erythrocyte lysis; and (4)
flow cytometric acquisition and analysis of list mode data.
When whole blood is added to the reagent, the fluorochrome-labeled antibodies in the
reagent bind specifically to leukocyte surface antigens. During acquisition, the cells
travel past the laser beam and scatter the laser light. The stained cells fluoresce. These
scatter and fluorescence signals, detected by the instrument, provide information
about the cell’s size, internal complexity, and relative fluorescence intensity. BD
Multitest reagents employ fluorescence triggering, allowing direct fluorescence
gating of the lymphocyte population to reduce contamination of unlysed or nucleated
red blood cells in the gate. A precise volume of sample is stained directly in a BD
Trucount tube. The lyophilized pellet in the tube dissolves, releasing a known number
of fluorescent beads. During analysis, the absolute number (cells/μL) of positive cells
in the sample can be determined by comparing cellular events to bead events. BD
FACSCanto clinical software (version 2.0 or higher) determines absolute counts.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was determined by running duplicate measurements of
commercially available control at different levels o analyte concentration
twice a day for a period of 21 operating days on three different instruments.
Standard deviations with 95% confidence limits were calculated for the
within-run precision and the total precision of the lymphocyte subset
percentages.
Percent CVs with 95% confidence limits were calculated for the within-run
precision and the total precision of the lymphocyte subset percentage.

A total of 123 donor samples were collected and evaluated. Samples with an even
gender distribution and representative of a healthy adult population – between the
ages of 18 and 65 years – were tested and used to establish the lymphocyte subset
reference intervals. Each sample was stained in duplicate, and the averaged values
of the duplicates were used in determining the reference interval.
