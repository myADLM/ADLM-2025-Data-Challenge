K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
FIDIS™ dsDNA is based on the use of distinct uniform size color-coded
microspheres and a benchtop flow cytometer interfaced to digital signal
processing hardware and software. A red diode laser beam in the flow cytometer
classifies each set of microspheres on the basis of its unique fluorescence
intensity (red to orange) thus identifying which analyte is being tested. At the
same time, a green laser beam illuminates the external second molecule
fluorescence to quantify the reaction related to the specific analyte.
The test is performed in a 96 well blank microplate with a filtering membrane at
the bottom of the wells. In the first step, the sample is distributed in each well
containing the microspheres covalently coupled to dsDNA. If this sample
contains the suspected antibodies, these antibodies bind to the antigen. After
incubation, a wash step using a filtration process removes the unbound
antibodies.

A phycoerythrin labeled anti-human IgG will bind to the captured antibodies.
The reaction is then directly measured by the flow cytometer, which categorizes
each set of microspheres according to its fluorescence color while
simultaneously measuring the average fluorescence emitted by the conjugate. A
calibration system permits the determination of the titer of each sample by
interpolation for each antigenic specificity.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To evaluate intra-assay and inter assay reproducibility, nine samples
were analyzed on the FIDIS™ dsDNA. For within-run, the nine
samples were assayed 10 times in one run and for between-run; the nine
samples were assayed 4 times per run for 6 runs. Results were as
follows:
Within-run Between-run
Antigen Mean value %CV Mean Value %CV
dsDNA 23 3 24 6
45 3 51 9
46 3.8 53 8.3
70 4.3 69 4.3
84 12.2 90 11.3
138 3.9 140 4.2
162 4.8 199 7.4
519 2.8 524 5.6
579 7.6 709 11.8
Precision of the assay using the optional automated CARIS system was
assessed. For within-run, five samples were assayed 10 times in one run and
for between-run; five samples were assayed 4 times per run for 6 runs. Results
were as follows:
Within-run Between-run
Antigen Mean value %CV Mean Value %CV
dsDNA 41 6.8 41 6.2
70 4.5 67.7 7.2
80 7.0 70.8 11.2
94 8.9 98.3 10.4
894 5.3 871.5 5.2
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity is not claimed for this assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
The dsDNA values in the calibrator are established using the WHO
International Standard for Anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA), human
code: WO/80. The WHO WO/80 standard is lyophilized powder and is
reconstituted to a concentration of 200 IU/mL. Information leaflet from
WHO (First International Standard for Antibodies for Anti Double-
stranded DNA (dsDNA)) was provided.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering substances
To evaluate the system for potential cross reactivity to other antibodies
and interference from blood components, 35 samples were tested. High
level of complement proteins were used but the specific kind of
complement was not provided. A statement to avoid the use of abnormal
concentration of these samples was added to the Limitations of the
Procedure. The following results were obtained.
No of samples positive
Samples for dsDNA
Cryoglobulinemia N=5 0
Complement N=10 2
Hypergammaglobulinemia N=1 0
IgG monoclonal immunoglobulins 0
N=3
IgM monoclonal immunoglobulins 0
N=7
Rheumatoid Factor N=2 0
Plasma (sodium citrate)N =5 0
Hemolyzed sera N=2 0
f. Assay cut-off:
Eighty five (85) samples including 50 normal blood donor samples and
35 samples with potential biological interferences (see analytical
specificity) were run to establish the cut-offs for the assays. The
following results were obtained:
Percentile of the 30 IU/mL 40 IU/mL
Distribution values
dsDNA 94.1% (80/85) 95.3% (81/85)
Between these thresholds, results are considered equivocal or borderline.
