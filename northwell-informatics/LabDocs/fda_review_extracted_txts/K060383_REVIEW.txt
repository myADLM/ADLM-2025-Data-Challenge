The sponsor conducted a total precision study in accordance with CLSI EP5-A for each
component of variation (between-day, between-run, and within-run) per protocol. Two
control levels (Level 1 and Level 2) at normal and abnormal analyte concentrations were
tested. These controls were evaluated over 20 days, two runs per day, and two replicates
per run. Precision was reported as the total %CV. Serum precision results are
summarized in the below table.

This study was intended to supplement data obtained from the twenty-day serum
precision study and provides a limited assessment of the performance of the assay with
the urine and CSF matrices. Two control levels (Level 1 and Level 2) at normal and

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To determine the linear range of analyte concentrations of the Glucose assay on the
AEROSET and ARCHITECT c8000 Systems the sponsor assayed ten samples at
various concentrations spanning the desired linear range of the assay with four
replicates per concentration. At least one level was included which exceeded the
desired linear range. The percent recovery for each sample was determined by
dividing the mean observed result by the expected value. The sponsor’s acceptance
criteria were the acceptable difference between the observed result and expected
value be within ± 6% or ± 1 mg/dL, whichever is greater, for serum; and ± 10% or ±
1 mg/dL, whichever is greater, for urine.
Serum linearity results are presented in the tables below.

The data presented indicate acceptable linearity of urine over the claimed measuring
range (1 to 800 mg/dL) for urine/ CSF.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
The reagent calibration stability was determined by the recovery method of Glucose
reagent. Fresh reagent was calibrated with fresh calibrators on Day 0. Control
material and a prepared test sample near the linear high were analyzed on Day 0, 1, 7,
14, 15, 21, 28, 29, 32, and 33. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria were the target for %
recovery was 94 to 106% of the Day 0 results. All test points up to and including Day
33 met the target for % recovery. The resulting calibration stability claim is 30 days.
The reagent open onboard stability was also determined by the recovery method on
multiple lots of Glucose reagent. Fresh reagent was calibrated with fresh calibrators
on Day 0. Control material and a prepared test sample near the linear high were
analyzed on Day 0, 1, 7, 14, 15, 21, 28, 29, 32 and, 33. The open onboard stability
claim is 30 days. The sponsor claims a product shelf-life/expiration of 12 months.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor determined the functional sensitivity of the Glucose assay based on the
Limit Of Quantitation (LOQ) on the AEROSET and the ACHITECT c8000 Systems.
To determine the LOQ, test levels near the linear low for the Glucose assay were run
in replicates of 10, on three instruments, two runs per instrument. The limit of
quantitation was defined as the lowest concentration of analyte which has imprecision
less than or equal to 20% CV. The sponsor’s internal verification study supported an
LOQ of 5.0 mg/dL (0.278 mmol/L) for the serum application and 1.0 mg/dL (0.056
mmol/L) for the urine/CSF application. The LOD testing for Glucose was performed
using a study design based on CLSI EP17-A. An internal verification study by the
sponsor supported an LOD of 2.5 mg/dL (0.139 mmol/L) for the serum application,
and 1.0 mg/dL (0.056 mmol/L) for the urine/CSF application. The proportions of
false positives (α) and false negatives (β) were less than 5% and the limit of blank
(LOB) was 0.33 mg/dL.

e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor conducted interference studies to evaluate any interference in the Glucose
assay caused by bilirubin, hemoglobin, and triglyceride (Intralipid) for serum samples on
the AEROSET and ARCHITECT c8000 Systems. For urine samples, testing for
interference was performed using hydrochloric acid, sodium fluoride, acetic acid,
ascorbate, boric acid, nitric acid, protein, sodium carbonate, and sodium oxalate.
Interferents which may falsely elevate or reduce the concentration of an analyte were
tested per the work instruction protocol for Glucose. Human serum samples (reference) at
two glucose concentrations (Medical Decision Level 1 and 2) and urine samples
(reference) were spiked with various levels of interferents.
According to the sponsor, four replicates of each interferent level and four replicates of
reference sample were run. The percent recovery was determined by dividing the mean
result of each interferent sample by the mean result of the reference sample. The
sponsor’s acceptance criteria were the level of interference was considered acceptable if
there was no more than ± 6% difference between the interferent result and the reference
result (serum) or no more than ± 10% difference between the interferent result and the
reference result (urine). Testing was performed using the AEROSET System.
The tables below summarize the results for serum samples, at each decision level, and
urine samples, respectively, indicating the highest interferent level at which the percent
interference was within ± 6% for serum and ± 10% for urine.

ARCHITECT® c8000® Systems compared to the Glucose/HK assay on the Hitachi
917 Analyzer. The study was conducted in accordance with CLSI EP9-A2 by testing
102 serum samples, 41 urine samples, and 52 CSF samples using each method. A
total of 3 serum samples, 12 urine samples, and 12 CSF samples were spiked with
NIST SRM917 to generate high analytical levels. A linear regression was performed
comparing the results for each method. The ranges of samples tested were as follows
- 13.3 to 663.9 mg/dL (Serum), 13.3 to 663.9 mg/dL (Urine), and 10.5 to 697.7
mg/dL (CSF).

b. Matrix comparison:
Ten (10) subjects were tested using each of the collection tubes to be evaluated. The
serum tube used for the baseline was the only glass tube; all other specimen tubes
were plastic. Data were analyzed for statistical differences between different tube
types. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria were acceptability of each anticoagulant is
based on a difference of less than ± 6% difference between the mean values of all
samples/ replicates for each tube type in question and the plain glass serum tube.
Testing was performed using the AEROSET System. The table below summarizes the
results of the specimen tube study.
