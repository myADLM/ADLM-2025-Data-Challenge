L. Test Principle:
The Emit® 2000 Tacrolimus Assay utilizes competition for tacrolimus antibody
binding sites. Tacrolimus in the sample competes with tacrolimus in the Enzyme
Reagent that is labeled with recombinant enzyme glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogensase (rG6PDH). Active (unbound) rG6PDH enzyme converts the
oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in the antibody reagent to
NADH, resulting in a kinetic absorbance change that can be measured

spectrophotometrically. Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody,
allowing tacrolimus concentrations to be measured in terms of enzyme activity.
The Emit® 2000 Tacrolimus Sample Pretreatment Reagent contains cupric sulfate
in water and is used to pretreat the whole blood samples, calibrators, and controls
prior to testing with the Emit® 2000 Tacrolimus Assay. The pretreatment process
lyses the cells, extracts the tacrolimus, and precipitates most of the blood proteins.
The pretreated samples are centrifuged, and an aliquot of the resulting supernatant
containing tacrolimus is then assayed using the Emit® 2000 Tacrolimus Assay.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
All of the performance data for the Emit® 2000 Tacrolimus Assay was gathered
on the V-Twin® Analyzer.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
An external site precision study was conducted by assaying 4 levels of spiked
whole blood hemolysate pools according to NCCLS EP5-A. The pools were
prepared from EDTA whole blood with tacrolimus spiked in at low, moderate,
and high levels. Specimens at each level were analyzed in duplicate twice per
day for 20 days (n=80). The results for within run and total precision are
shown in the table below.

Tacrolimus was assessed using tacrolimus-free EDTA whole blood spiked to
5, 15 and 25 ng/mL of tacrolimus. Four separate runs were pretreated and
assayed in replicates of 5 (n=20 for each level). The percent recovery was
calculated using the following equation:
% Recovery = (V-Twin mean result)/ (Nominal spiked concentration) x 100
Recovery study results are summarized below. The percent recovery for all
levels met the sponsors’ acceptance criteria of 90 – 110%.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was assessed according to NCCLS EP6-A. Standard solutions were
prepared by sequential mixing a high (30 ng/mL) and a low (0 ng/mL) pool to
create a set of 5 samples pools with concentrations of 30, 22.5, 15, 7.5 and 0
ng/mL. Each pool was pretreated and assayed in replicates of 5. The mean
result (y) was compared to the spiked concentration (x) and plotted. The
linear regression equation was y=1.0235x + 0.244 with a correlation
coefficient of 0.9984.
A high sample dilution study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of
results when a high sample is diluted with tacrolimus-negative EDTA whole
blood or the Emit® 2000 Tacrolimus Calibrator (0 ng/mL). Ten patient
negative samples were spiked with either 35 or 80 ng/mL tacrolimus and
assayed twice in replicates of 5 in either 1:2 or 1:3 dilutions with either
negative whole blood or the Emit® 2000 Tacrolimus zero calibrator. The
percent recovery was calculated using the following equation:
% Recovery = (V-Twin mean result)/ (Nominal spiked concentration) x 100.
The % recoveries for the negative whole blood or calibrator diluted 1:2 ranged
from 97 to 101.4%. The % recoveries for the negative whole blood or
calibrator diluted 1:3 ranged from 90.0 to 101.2%. The results are
summarized below.

The percent recovery met the sponsors’ acceptance criteria of 90 – 110% and
support their reportable range claim of 2.0 to 30 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Real-time stability studies were conducted on the Emit® Tacrolimus Assay
reagents. The studies met the sponsors’ acceptance criteria and supported the
18 month shelf life and 12 week open bottle stability when stored at 2-8°. The
sponsor also notifies the user to look for reagent deterioration by the following
statement “If the antibody reagent turns yellow, it has deteriorated and,
therefore, must be discarded along with its accompanying buffer and enzyme
reagents.”
The sponsor conducted a freeze-thaw study using five whole blood samples
from transplant patients of varying levels of tacrolimus. The frozen samples
were thawed and assayed 5 times to determine their mean tacrolimus

d. Detection limit:
An analytical sensitivity (limit of the blank) study was conducted by assaying
the 0 ng/mL tacrolimus calibrator in replicates of 20. The sponsor defined
analytical sensitivity as the mean of the 0 ng/mL samples plus 2 SD. This
level is the lowest concentration of tacrolimus that can be distinguished from
zero with a 95% confidence. The mean was 0.455 ng/mL and the SD was
0.528. The mean + 2SD was calculated to be 1.511 ng/mL. The sensitivity
results obtained supports the sponsors’ analytical sensitivity claim of 2 ng/mL.
A functional sensitivity study was conducted with 4 patient sample pools
(values ranging from 0.00 to 3.0 ng/mL). The sponsor defined functional
sensitivity as the lowest drug concentration for which acceptable assay
precision is noted. The four patient samples were measured once a week for
six weeks with two different lots of reagents and calibrators. The mean,
standard deviation and %CV (y) were calculated and plotted against the mean
of the test sample (y). The regression line of y=-0.3727x + 1.2413 was
obtained. The analyte concentration corresponding to a 20% CV is 2.8
ng/mL. Based on the studies conducted, the analytical sensitivity is 2 ng/mL
and the functional sensitivity is 2.8 ng/mL.
The sponsor stated that the EMIT technology is not based on the “sandwich”
principle and is not susceptible to hook effect.
e. Analytical specificity:
Potential interferences were evaluated by adding known amounts of
exogenous and endogenous substances in the presence of 15 ng/mL tacrolimus
in negative whole blood samples. The sample containing the interferent was
compared to the control, which contained only 15 ng/mL tacrolimus in the
whole blood. All samples were pretreated and assayed in duplicate. The
results are summarized in the chart below.

administered drugs, including four immunosuppressive drugs. A sample was
prepared containing the co-administrated drug in the presence of 15 ng/mL
tacrolimus in negative whole blood. All samples were pretreated and assayed
five times. No cross-reactivity was observed and a complete list of the
compounds can be found in the assay package insert.
The sponsor recommends that the blood should be drawn using EDTA as the
anticoagulant. Heparinized samples are not recommended because they may
form clots during storage. The sponsor notifies users of this in the storage and
collection section of the package insert.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The Emit® Tacrolimus Assay was compared against two methods: liquid
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and the Abbott
IMx® Tacrolimus II Assay at two external sites. Trough samples from
patients were obtained from multiple geographic sites and encompassed liver
and kidney transplant organ types. The samples were pretreated with the

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor references the Consensus Document (published in 1995) that
describes targets for 12 –hour trough whole-blood concentrations and references
the Fujisama Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.’s interpretation of the PDR which describes
co-medication interference. The described tacrolimus trough range (from 5 to 20
ng/mL) depends on the transplant type, stage after transplantation, and the
medical practice. Higher or lower concentrations may be associated with an
increase in the incidence of adverse effects. Blood levels can be affected by co-
medications. Patients treated with viral protease inhibitors for HIV infection may
have dramatically altered metabolism of tacrolimus, which may cause elevation of
tacrolimus to at least 100 ng/mL, and would require novel dosing. Tacrolimus is
extensively metabolized by the liver. Therefore, circulating tacrolimus levels may
be influenced by drugs that affect hepatic microsomal enzymes, particularly the
cytochrome P450 system. Substances know to inhibit these enzymes will
decrease hepatic metabolism and increase tacrolimus levels.
Therapeutic ranges vary according to the commercial test used, and the sponsor
recommends that ranges should be established for each commercial test. Values
obtained with different assay methods cannot be used interchangeable due to
differences in assay methods and cross-reactivity with metabolites, nor should
correction factors be applied. Therefore, the sponsor recommends consistent use
of one assay for individual patients.
