The CyAn™ DXD Flow Cytometer with Summit™ software and user manual is intended
for use as an In-Vitro Diagnostic device for identification and enumeration of the relative
fraction of lymphocyte subsets in human peripheral whole blood using flow cytometry,
i.e., identifies the relative percentage of CD4 and CD8 T-cells as demonstrated by gating
on CD3 positive cells. TC-660, the three color combination, CD3, CD4 and CD8
intended for use to identify the relative percentages of CD4 and CD8 positive T cells.
Calibrators, FluoroSpheres (Dako K0110) are intended for in vitro use on the Dako
CyAn™ DXD flow cytometer with Summit™ software to adjust detector voltages and
monitor daily instrument performance. CD3 FITC (Dako F0818), CD3 RPE (R0810), and
CD3 APC (C7225) single antibody- fluorochrome conjugates are intended to be used for
setting fluorescence compensation parameters using automated compensation.

sample preparation method, for identification and enumeration of CD3, CD4 and CD8
lymphocyte subsets using TC-660.
For In-Vitro Diagnostic Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Not applicable.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable.
I. Device Description:
The Dako CyAn™ DXD device is a bench-top flow cytometer system relying on multiple (up
to three) laser stimulation of fluorescence tagged lymphocytes. It is used with the Dako
MultiMix, a triple color reagent; one each to CD3, CD4 and CD8, conjugated to
fluorochromes APC(allophycocyanin), r-phycoerythrin, and fluorescein isothiocynate, which
are balanced to identify the dual positive T-cell populations (CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+) in
peripheral blood lymphocytes. The instrument requires daily set-up with Dako FluoroSpheres
consisting of a set of 5 bead populations having different fluorescent intensities and one non-
fluorescent bead population. The combination of fluorochromes enables excitation by light of
any wavelength from 365-650 nm. The CyAn DXD utilizes anti-human CD3 conjugated with
FITC, RPE and APC to perform autocompensation.

Draft Guidance for 510(k) Submission of Lymphocyte http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/475.pdf
Immunophenotyping IVDs using Monoclonal OIVD DIHD
Antibodies
L. Test Principle:
TC660 consists of three monoclonal antibodies, each labeled with a unique fluorochrome. The
CD8, CD4, and CD3 specific antibodies have been conjugated with FITC, RPE and APC,
respectively. Lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood samples may be stained with
fluorochrome-conjugated antibody and evaluated after interfering red blood cells (RBCs) have
been lysed.
An aliquot of a stained and lysed sample is applied to a flow cytometer and the cells flow in a
single file past a laser beam. Stained cells will fluoresce depending on the nature of the
fluorochrome label, FITC with an emission maximum at 520 nm, RPE at 575 nm and APC at
660 nm. This fluorescence as well as forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) light is
detected by the flow cytometer. The combination of fluorescence, FSC and SSC
characteristics allows identification of T-cell subsets.
When excluding granulocytes and monocytes from the analysis gate on the basis of their FSC
and SSC characteristics percent positive, lymphocytes can be determined. The T-cell counts
are typically expressed as percentages of lymphocytes. Since each type of flow cytometer has
different operating characteristics, each laboratory must determine its optimal operating
procedure.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the instrument was measured in two separate studies. In the first study, 5
whole blood specimens that had different ranges of CD3, CD4 and CD8 expression
levels were used to measure precision for the FITC, RPE and APC parameters. Each
specimen was separated in aliquots of 6, mixed with the test reagent and then acquired
10 times on the CyAn. The TC660 reagent (combined CD8 FITC/ CD4 RPE/ CD3
APC) was used as the detecting reagent. For the FITC parameter, standard deviations
of 30 aliquots ranged from 0.18 to 0.88. For the RPE and APC parameters, standard
deviations of 30 aliquots ranged from 0.17 to 1.02 and 0.25 to 0.93 respectively.
In the second study, cells obtained from JM and Raji cell lines were the test matrix.
Cell line concentrations were 10%, 50% and 90% to test the middle and outer limits of
5

the instrument. Combination reagents consisting of CD3, CD4 or CD8 antibodies
conjugated to different fluorochromes (APC-Cy7, RPE-Cy5, RPE-Cy7 and Pacific
Blue) were used as the test reagents. Cells were mixed, separated in aliquots, and
mixed with the antibody reagents. Each aliquot was acquired on the CyAn 10 times.
Means, standard deviations and %CV’s were determined. Means and standard
deviations were determined as listed in table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
For linearity, duplicate tubes of 5 different cell line concentrations ranging from 0 to
100% of positive cells were prepared. Each of 7 parameters was assessed for linear
conformity to the theoretical 1:1 line. Linear equations for each parameter had a
slope close to 1 and intercept close to 0, with an R2 of at least 0.99.

years for CD3FITC and two years for CD3RPE and CD3APC.
Based on manufacturer's supplied information on stability, the fluorospheres have a
shelf life of two years. To verify this, a reference letter from Spherotech was
included.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Comparison testing was preformed on a total of ninety-two (92) normal and abnormal
specimens at three study sites. Regression analysis was performed comparing data obtained
from the predicate and DakoCytomation FDA-cleared dual antibody reagents (CD45/CD14,
CD3/CD4 and CD3/CD8) combination products to three different triple antibody-
fluorochrome combination products run on the CyAn™ DXD instrument. Linear regression
statistical analysis of the predicate device to test device comparison gave R2 values

2. Software:
The CyAn Flow Cytometer requires use of the Summit software program to establish
instrument settings, control acquisition, manipulate and save data, and provide other
status and control regarding instrument behavior.
FDA has reviewed applicants Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes __X__ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Patient data is manually entered.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Collect blood specimens by venipuncture into evacuated tubes containing EDTA,
completely expending the vacuum in the tubes. Mix the blood well with the anticoagulant
to prevent clotting. At least 100 µL of whole blood is required for each test. Ideally,
blood samples should be processed immediately after collection. When this is not
possible, each laboratory should validate that its collection and holding methods maintain
specimen integrity comparable to freshly processed material. When using EDTA, blood
samples should be held at room temperature (18-22 °C) and processed within 30 hours.
5. Calibration:
DakoCytomation K0110 FluoroSpheres are intended for in vitro use on the
DakoCytomation CyAn DXD flow cytometer with Summit™ software to adjust detector
voltages and monitor daily instrument performance. CD3 FITC (DakoCytomation
F0818), CD3 PE (R0810), and CD3 APC (C7225) single antibody-fluorochrome
conjugates are intended to be used for setting fluorescence compensation parameters.
6. Quality Control:
Daily Quality Control of the CyAn DXD is achieved through analysis of FluoroSpheres
6-peak beads (K0110) to ensure consistent resolution and sensitivity. Further, a normal
specimen can be for an internal quality control.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
Performance Characteristics Section above:
Carryover testing was performed using 3 replicates of the 100% cell line concentrations
followed by 3 replicates of 0% concentration of cell line cells. Parameters that were tested in
the carryover study using cell lines included FITC, RPE, APC, Pe-Cy7, PE-Cy5, Pacific
Blue, and APC-Cy7. Average carryover ranged from 0.45 to 1.18. The range found for the

0% cells after 100% cells were tested was 0.35 to 1.72. These levels remain within the
known lower limits of detection of the instrument and these effects are considered minimal
for the 7 parameters tested.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
