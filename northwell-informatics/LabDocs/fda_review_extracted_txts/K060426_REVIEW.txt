a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The D-Glucose used in this control is traceable to an in-house glucose
preparation. Stability characteristics of the Liberty Glucose Control were
determined using the Arrhenius model of accelerated elevated temperature
and real time studies to determine estimated storage stability at 2 – 30 ºC.
Open vial stability was determined to be 90 days at 2-30 ºC.
The expected values were determined by repeat testing on each glucose
monitor (Bayer Ascensia DEX 2/DEX and Breeze). Statistical analysis of the
data obtained resulted in one range for the three glucose monitors. The
expected results may change with each new lot, but the control range is listed
in the product insert. In addition, the product insert alerts the user to use the
control range indicated in the control’s product insert rather than the glucose
test strip product’s insert.
