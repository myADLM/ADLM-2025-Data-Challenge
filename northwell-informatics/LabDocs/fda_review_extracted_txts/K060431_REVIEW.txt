K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The anti-RNA Polymerase III ELISA Kit measures anti-RNAP III antibodies present
in the serum by ELISA. Diluted Calibrators, controls, and patient serum are added to
microwell coated with recombinant purified RNAP III antigen, allowing anti-RNAP
III antibodies to react with the immobilized antigen. After washing to remove any
unbound serum proteins, horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti human IgG, IgA,
IgM is added and incubated. Following another washing step, the peroxidase
substrate is added and incubated for an additional period of time. Acid solution is
then added to each well to terminate the enzyme reaction and to stabilize the color
development. The assay can be semi-quantified by measuring the reaction
photometrically and plotting the results.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The intra-assay reproducibility was determined by testing 6 samples 8 times
on 3 assays with 3 lots. Two samples with high anti-RNAP III concentrations
(61.1 and 150.6 U/mL) had %CVs of 2.0 and 3.4 %, four samples close to the
assay cut-off (14.6-32.4 U/mL) had %CVs ranging from 3.3% to 8.6%.
The inter-assay reproducibility was determined by testing 6 samples in
duplicate 8 times for 5 consecutive days. Two samples with high Anti-RNAP
III concentrations (56.0 and 157.4 U/mL) had %CVs of 3.2% and 4.1 %, four
samples close to the assay cut-off (17.2-33.8 U/mL) had %CVs ranging from
3.5% to 7.3%.
The inter-lot reproducibility was determined by testing 6 samples in duplicate
on two lots of plates seven times. Four low concentration sample (16.8-33.8
U/mL) had %CVs ranging from 2.6-4.6%. Two high concentration samples
(58.8-153.6 U/mL) had %CVs ranging from 1.3-2.8%. The overall %CV
ranged from 1.3-4.6%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
There is no claim for linearity for this assay.
The assay reportable range is from 5-200 U/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no reference standard for anti-RNAP III. The calibrators are prepared
in-house and arbitrary units are assigned during development process. Positive
and negative controls are not supplied but are recommended.
d. Detection limit:

The lower limit of assay range was determined by dilution study. A sample
that had 17 U/mL anti-RNAP III was chosen and serially diluted. The serial
dilutions were measured and the criteria were:
1) CV (%) of eight repetitive assay is lower than 10
2) Mean ± 2SD of the dilution does not cross over with the adjacent
dilution.
Results showed that 4.1 U/mL was the lowest value that satisfied the above
conditions.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference by endogenous substances: The package insert states that highly
hemolyzed, icteric, lipemic, or microbially contaminated samples should not
be used in these assays. Interference studies were performed on aliquots of
five samples spiked with different concentrations of endogenous substances,
namely hemoglobin, bilirubin C, bilirubin F, formazine (chyle) and
rheumatoid factor (RF). The assay results were not affected with hemoglobin
(up to 523 mg/dL), bilirubin C (up to 19.4 mg/dL), bilirubin F (up to 20.9
mg/dL), formazine (up to 2,800 units as) and RF (up to 500 IU/mL).
For assessing crossreactivity, the assay was tested on other autoimmune
disease samples (MCTD, DM, PM, RA, SLE, and Vasculitis). Results showed
minimal or no crossreactivity (refer to summary table below). Since Sjogrën’s
Syndrome (SjS) samples were not tested, the package insert states that the
assay was not tested with Sjogrën’s Syndrome (SjS) samples.
The assay was also tested on ten E. coli antibody positive samples and no
crossreactivity was observed.
Disease Positive sample Positive rate
MCTD 2/21 9.5%
DM 1/21 4.8%
PM 1/23 4.3%
RA 0/25 0.0%
SLE 1/33 3.0%
Vasculitis 1/21 4.8%
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off value of 28 U/mL was established from a combined panel of 357
specimens collected from 143 healthy blood donors (HBD), 158 diagnosed
SSc patients and 56 autoimmune diseases (33 SLE. 5 DM, 8 PM, 10 RA). The
mean anti-RNAP III concentration of the HBD samples was 2.6 U/mL with a
SD of 5.4 U/mL. Of the 143 HBD samples, only 2 samples had results above
20.5 U/mL, i.e. 42.1 and 42.4 U/mL. The anti-RNAP III concentrations for the
non-SSc diseases were from 0.0-7.8 U/mL except for 1 SLE patient with a
result of 52.7 U/mL.
75 of the 158 SSc samples were positive on the Anti-RNAP III ELISA kit
with results ranging from 35.5-354.8 U/mL; and 83 of the 158 samples were
negative with results ranging from 0.0-27.3 U/mL. An ROC analysis based on
the 158 SSc samples and 199 normal plus target disease patients indicated a

DM	1/21	4.8%

range between 27-38U/mL. The cut-off of 28 U/mL was selected based on the
fact that the highest value of the negative SSc sample was 27.3 U/mL.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Testing was performed on 211 samples which included 53 healthy blood
donors and 158 Systemic sclerosis (SSc) samples. The positive percent
agreement was 45.5% (76/167); the negative percent agreement was 97.7%
(43/44); and the overall agreement was 56.4% (119/211). The low correlation
is due to fact that the predicate ANA IFA method detects all antinuclear
antibodies, while the Anti-RNAP III ELISA method detects antibodies only to
RNAP III. Results are summarized below.

b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and specificity:
The MBL Anti-RNAP III clinical sensitivity and specificity study evaluated
609 clinically defined samples from patients with the following diagnosis: 257
Systemic sclerosis (SSc), 33 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), 25
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), 23 Polymyositis (PM), 21 Dermatomyositis
(DM), 21 Vasculitis, 21 Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD) and 208
healthy subjects. No pediatric samples were included in this study. Sensitivity
was 23.4% (60/257) and the specificity was 97.4% (343/352) (see table
below). The low sensitivity is due to the fact that the MBL Anti-RNAP III test
only detects a subset of SSc patients.
