L. Test Principle:
For albumin, a colorimetric test is used using Bromcresol Green dye-binding
procedure. At pH 4.20, in succinate buffer and with a nonionic surfactant Brij35, the
Bromcresol Green (BCG) fixes itself selectively to the albumin of the sample,
producing a blue color which is measured at 628 nm. The intensity of the coloring is
directly proportional to the albumin concentration.
For micro-albumin, anti-albumin antibodies of the reagent react with albumin of the
sample by forming antigen-antibody complexes. The resulting agglutination is
measured by turbidimetry. The obtained absorbance change is proportional to the
quantity of microalbumin in the sample. The actual concentration is then determined
by interpolation from a calibration curve prepared from calibrators of known
concentration.
For total protein, the protein, in an alkaline solution and in the presence of copper
ions, form a purple colored complex between the Biuret (NH2-CO-NH-CO-NH2) and
two consecutive peptidic connections. The resulting complex’s color is directly
proportional to the protein concentration.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity for Albumin CP was assessed for non-post dilution samples in
accordance with CLSI EP6-A. Samples used for this study were concentrated
human sera using ultrafiltration. Ten different levels of albumin (each tested
4 times) were prepared based on the dilution of the highest concentration
solution level with a solution near the low limit of detection resulting in a
range of samples from 0.62 to 6.16 g/dL. The linearity of the albumin assay
was evaluated by comparing observed versus expected values across the
expected range. A linear regression analysis was performed on the data and
plotted. The sponsor’s acceptable bias for recovery of the samples is ±8%.
The observed linearity across the reportable range has a slope of 0.9335, and
an intercept of 0.1252. The assay range was demonstrated to be linear from
0.62 to 6.16 g/dL. The sponsor will claim a range of 0.46 (the lowest value of
the comparison study) to 5.60 g/dL. Recovery of post dilution serum samples
was also assessed comparing manual versus automatic dilution by the
PENTRA 400. Nine samples were each tested 4 times and ranged from 6.26
to 10.98 g/dL. The sponsor’s acceptable bias for recovery of the samples is
±8%. The data supports the sponsor’s claim of a post dilution limit of 11.2
g/dL.

accordance with CLSI EP6-A. Samples used for this study were human urine.
Ten different levels of albumin (each tested 4 times) were prepared based on
the dilution of the highest concentration solution level with a solution near the
low limit of detection resulting in a range of samples from 16.6 to 195.6
mg/L. The linearity of the albumin assay was evaluated by comparing
observed versus expected values across the expected range. A linear
regression analysis was performed on the data and plotted. The sponsor’s
acceptable bias for recovery of the samples is ±10%. The observed linearity
across the reportable range has a slope of 0.9697, and an intercept of 5.8868.
The assay range was demonstrated to be linear from 16.6 to 195.6 mg/L. The
sponsor will claim a range of 9 (the lowest value of the comparison study) to
200 mg/L. Recovery of post dilution serum samples was also assessed
comparing manual versus automatic dilution by the PENTRA 400. Eleven
samples were each tested 4 times and ranged from 219.3 to 1904.8 mg/L. The
sponsor’s acceptable bias for recovery of the samples is ±10%. The data
supports the sponsor’s claim of a post dilution limit of 2000 mg/L.
Linearity for Total Protein CP in serum was assessed in accordance with CLSI
EP6-A. Samples used for this study were concentrated human sera using
ultrafiltration. Eleven different levels of total protein (each tested 4 times)
were prepared based on the dilution of the highest concentration solution level
with a solution near the low limit of detection resulting in a range of samples
from 0.675 to 12.02 g/dL. The linearity of the total protein assay was
evaluated by comparing observed versus expected values across the expected
range. A linear regression analysis was performed on the data and plotted.
The sponsor’s acceptable bias for recovery of the samples is ±5%. The
observed linearity across the reportable range has a slope of 0.9961, and an
intercept of 0.1196. The assay range for serum was demonstrated to be linear
from 0.7 to 12.0 g/dL. The sponsor will claim a range of 0.6 (the limit of
quantitation) to 10.0 g/dL. Recovery of post dilution serum samples was also
assessed comparing manual versus automatic dilution by the PENTRA 400.
Eleven samples were each tested 4 times and ranged from 11.54 to 20.08
g/dL. The sponsor’s acceptable bias for recovery of the samples is ±4%. The
data supports the sponsor’s claim of a post dilution limit of 20 g/dL.
The sponsor demonstrated linearity of Total Protein CP results in Lithium
Heparin plasma samples through a linearity study. Nine different levels of
total protein (each tested 4 times) were prepared based on the dilution of the
highest concentration solution level with a solution near the low limit of
detection resulting in a range of samples from 2.339 to 11.867 g/dL. The
linearity of the total protein assay was evaluated by comparing observed
versus expected values across the expected range. A linear regression analysis
was performed on the data and plotted. The sponsor’s acceptable bias for
recovery of the samples is ±5%. The observed linearity across the reportable
range has a slope of 1.0027, and an intercept of 0.094. The assay range for
plasma was demonstrated to be linear from 2.3 to 11.8 g/dL. The sponsor will
13

--- Page 14 ---
claim a range of 0.6 (the limit of quantitation) to 10.0 g/dL for plasma
samples.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Albumin CP reagent stability was tested in real-time with reagents stored at 2-
8°C using 3 different lots. Real time stability was determined to be 36
months. On-board stability was determined to be 83 Days.
Micro-albumin CP reagent stability was tested in real-time with reagents
stored at 2-8°C using 3 different lots. Real time stability was determined to be
24 months. On-board stability was determined to be 23 Days. For the Micro-
albumin controls, stability studies determined a calibration time stability of 11
days allowing a claim of 7 days. After this period, urinary albumin method on
ABX Pentra 400 using ABX Pentra Micro-Albumin CP reagent has to be re-
calibrated.
Albumin CP reagent stability was tested in real-time with reagents stored at 2-
8°C using 3 different lots. Real time stability was determined to be 36
months. On-board stability was determined to be 83 Days.
Total Protein CP reagent stability was tested in real-time with reagents stored
at 2-8°C using 3 different lots. Real time stability was determined to be 36
months. On-board stability was determined to be 6 Days.
The ABX PENTRA µ-Alb Control L/H are the same product as the ABX
PENTRA µ-Alb Cal level 25 and 100 mg/L. As such, the stability studies for
the ABX PENTRA µ-Alb Control L/H are the same as the stability studies for
the ABX PENTRA µ-Alb Cal. ABX Pentra µ-Alb Cal was determined
through real time stability studies that the stability at 2 - 10°C is 12 months.
ABX Pentra µ-Alb Cal was determined through real time stability studies that
the open vial stability is 4 weeks between 2-10°C or 3 months at –20°C.
For ABX PENTRA N Control & ABX PENTRA P Control traceability, the
values of the ABX PENTRA Controls are assigned from the ABX PENTRA
calibrator, reagents and analyzers. The target value is determined by the
median of results from 150 measurements/parameters. Confidence range is
determined as the calculated range in percent which is based on the
experimental results from the previous target value trials. The range declared
in the target value sheet is equal to the assigned value +/- 3 standard
deviations (3 SD).
For ABX Pentra Multical traceability, the ABX Pentra Multical is prepared
from reference materials. Commercial calibrators are standardized by means
of a master lot which is stored at -80°C. Two controls are used to ensure that
the calibration values of the master lot, as well as the entire measurement
system (calibrator, reagent, and analyzer), remain stable during the storage
14

--- Page 15 ---
period. The target value is determined by the median of results from 150
measurements/parameters.
For the ABX PENTRA N Control, ABX PENTRA P Control, and ABX
PENTRA Multical, protocols and acceptance criteria for open and closed
stability of the controls and calibrators were described and found to be
acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit for the Albumin CP was determined by measuring 30
measurements of saline water (NaCl 0.9 g/L) + 4.65 SD. The limit of
detection for the Albumin CP assay was determined to be 0.02 g/dL.
Because the measurement of saline water is not possible with the normal
application of the Micro-albumin assay (no results available when sample
concentration is lower than the calibration curve), usual measurement of MDL
(30 measurements of saline water) is not possible. For the specific proteins
the Minimum Interpretation Limit (MIL) was used. Like MDL, MIL is the
lower concentration that could be distinguished from 0, concentration
calculated using the rate absorbency measurement of known concentration’s
samples and saline water. The limit of detection for the Micro-albumin CP
assay was determined to be 4 mg/L.
For the Total Protein CP assay, the limit of the blank (LoB) was determined
using physiological water (0.9% NaCl) assayed 90 times on 3 different
PENTRA 400 instruments. The LoB was determined as the mean of results +
1.645*SD which was 0.05 g/dL. The limit of detection (LoD) was then
determined with 4 samples with concentrations between LoB and LoB x 5
assayed 20 times and using LoD = LoB + 1.645* standard deviation. To
determine the limit of quantitation (LoQ), samples with concentrations of total
protein above the lower limit of the linear range (0.70 g/dL for serum and 2.30
g/dL for protein) were run to determine precision and recovery. The samples,
with a known concentration, were assayed 10 times. The sponsor’s
acceptance criteria is within-run precision being %CV <15% and bias <10%.
Using these criteria, it was determined that the LoQ for plasma samples was
0.26 g/L and 0.58 g/L for serum samples. The sponsor will claim a LoQ of
0.60 g/dL for the total protein assay.
e. Analytical specificity:
For Albumin CP: In accordance with the Valtec guideline, the tested
interferants were added to the base pooled serum at two different albumin
concentrations (normal and high). The base serum with each substance was
then serially diluted with the same base serum that was added saline instead of
substance to adjust albumin concentration. Hemoglobin up to 232 µmol/L
(400 mg/dL), total bilirubin up to 616 µmol/L (36 mg/dL), direct bilirubin up
to 616 µmol/L (36 mg/dL), and triglycerides (as Intralipid ®, representative of
15

--- Page 16 ---
lipemia, up to 7 mmol/L (612.5 mg/dL) do not show significant interference
with albumin determination. The sponsor also described through references
that some globulins could give an “albumin like coloration,” however states
that the procedure used on Pentra 400 eliminates this type of interference by a
fast reading. The sponsor states in the labeling that Ampicillin has been found
to seriously interfere with this type of colorimetric method.
For Micro-albumin CP: Substances were added to the base urine at two
different albumin concentrations (normal and high). The base urine with each
substance was then serially diluted with the same base urine that was added
saline instead of substance to adjust albumin concentration. Hemoglobin up
to 260 µmol/L (450 mg/dL), Ascorbic acid up to 5 g/L, Total Bilirubin up to
20 mg/dL, Urobilin up to 10 mg/dL, Creatinine up to 240 mg/dL do not show
significant interference with urinary albumin determination. The sponsor also
determined a prozone effect for the Micro-albumin assay to occur at 1200
mg/L with dilution being effective in overcoming the effect.
For Total Protein CP: In accordance with the Valtec guideline, the tested
interferants were added to the base pooled serum at two different total protein
concentrations (normal and high). The base serum with each substance was
then serially diluted with the same base serum that was added saline instead of
substance to adjust total protein concentration. Hemoglobin up to 72.5
µmol/L (1.25 g/L), total bilirubin up to 616 µmol/L (36 mg/dl), direct
bilirubin up to 616 µmol/L (36 mg/dl) and triglycerides (as Intralipid) up to
4.6 mmol/L (355 mg/dl) do not show significant interference with total
proteins determination by this test. The sponsor also described through
references that some globulins could give an “albumin like coloration,”
however states that the procedure used on Pentra 400 eliminates this type of
interference by a fast reading. The sponsor states in the labeling that
Ampicillin has been found to seriously interfere with this type of colorimetric
method.
