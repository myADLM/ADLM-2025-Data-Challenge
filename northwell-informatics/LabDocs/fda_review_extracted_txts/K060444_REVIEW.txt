laboratories as an in vitro test to determine the susceptibility of most Gram-
negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria isolates from pure culture
for Enterobacteriaceae and non-Enterobacteriaceae to antimicrobial agents
when used as instructed in the Phoenix™ system user’s manual.
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is intended for the
in vitro quantitative determination of antimicrobial susceptibility by minimal
inhibitory concentration (MIC) of most gram-negative aerobic and facultative
anaerobic bacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae and non -
Enterobacteriaceae and gram-positive bacteria belonging to the genera
Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Enterococcus.

Submission of the antibiotics cefepime at concentrations of 0.5 - 64 µg/mL
and ceftriaxone at concentrations of 0.5 – 64 µg/mL, for additional organism
groups to the Gram Negative ID/AST or AST only Phoenix™ panel.
3. Special condition for use statement(s)
All Proteus species will be suppressed from reporting cefepime (FEP) in the
Phoenix™ system.
All Proteus vulgaris/penneri will be suppressed from reporting ceftriaxone
(CRO) in the Phoenix™ system.
An alternate method should be performed when these combinations have been
identified.
Prescription Use Only
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
This submission is for the AST Panel only. The ID system was not reviewed.
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for AST Indicator.
The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily identified as gram
positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and equated to a 0.5
McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer. A
further dilution is made into an AST broth, which contains an AST indicator, prior to
inoculating the panel. The AST broth is a cation-adjusted broth containing Tween 80.
After adding the indicator solution to the AST inoculum, the color is blue, and after
inoculation and incubation, it changes to pink then colorless as reduction in the panel
well proceeds. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix™
Automated Microbiology System instrument where the panels are continuously incubated
at 35°C. The resulting AST has a final inoculum of 5 x 105 CFU/ml. The instrument
incubates, reads and records the results of the antimicrobial agents and interprets the
reactions to obtain a MIC value and category interpretation of the antimicrobial agents.

Organisms growing in the presence of a given antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator,
signaling organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or
inhibited by a given antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do
not produce a color change. Additional interpretation is done using software driven
“EXPERT” System using rules derived from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI). Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an AST result available
between 4-16 hours. This is only an autoread result; there are no manual readings
possible.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S16) “Methods
for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard.”
L. Test Principle:
The AST portion of the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth
based microdilution method that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-
reduction) to enhance detection of organism growth. The MIC is determined by
comparing growth in wells containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the
growth in “growth control wells” which contain no antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility
Intersite and Intrasite testing demonstrated >95% reproducibility.
The ten isolate study described in the guidance document was used
(10 organisms tested 3 times on 3 days at 3 sites).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or method):
Quality Control was performed during the testing of all isolates on
each day of testing with the following results. The table below
includes the concentrations tested around the expected range with
the frequency of the reference and the Phoenix™ results at each
concentration.

Phoenix produced acceptable QC results as compared to the
reference method results >95% of the time.
Inoculum density control: The organism suspension density of the
ID broth was equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard using the
BBL™ CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer which was verified each day of
testing. Internal data was used to demonstrate that the use of the
BBL™ CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer would produce reproducible
results. Five different instruments were used.
