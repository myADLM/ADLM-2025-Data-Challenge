Prescription Use Only
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
This submission is for the AST Panel only. The ID System was not reviewed.
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for AST Indicator.
The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily identified as gram
positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and equated to a 0.5
McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer. A
further dilution is made into an AST broth, which contains an AST indicator, prior to
inoculating the panel. The AST broth is a cation-adjusted broth containing Tween 80.
After adding the indicator solution to the AST inoculum, the color is blue, and after
inoculation and incubation, it changes to pink then colorless as reduction in the panel
well proceeds. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix™
Automated Microbiology System instrument where the panels are continuously incubated
at 35°C. The resulting AST has a final inoculum of 5 x 105 CFU/ml. The instrument
incubates, reads and records the results of the biochemical substrates and antimicrobial

agents and interprets the reactions to give a MIC value and category interpretation of the
antimicrobial agents. Organisms growing in the presence of a given antimicrobic agent
reduce the indicator, signaling organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobic agent.
Organisms killed or inhibited by a given antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the
indicator and therefore do not produce a color change. Additional interpretation is done
using software driven “EXPERT” System using rules derived from the Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an
AST result available between 4-16 hours. This is only an autoread result; there are no
manual readings possible.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S16) “Methods
for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard.”
L. Test Principle:
The AST portion of the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth
based microdilution method that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-
reduction) to enhance detection of organism growth. The MIC is determined by
comparing growth in wells containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the
growth in “growth control wells” which contain no antibiotic.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility

Phoenix produced acceptable QC results as compared to the
reference method results >95% of the time.
Inoculum density control: The organism suspension density of the
ID broth was equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard using the
BBL™ CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer which was verified each day of
testing. Internal data was used to demonstrate that the use of the
BBL™ CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer would produce reproducible
results. Five different instruments were used.
