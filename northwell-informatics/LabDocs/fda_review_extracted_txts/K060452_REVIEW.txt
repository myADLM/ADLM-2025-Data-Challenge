2. Indication(s) for use:
The Accuwell 17α-Hydroxyprogesterone EIA Kit is designed for the
quantitative measurement of 17α-Hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP)
concentrations in neonatal blood samples that have been collected onto
Whatman 903® specimen collection paper. The results are used to screen
newborns for classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Microplate reader capable of reading a wavelength of 650 nm
I. Device Description:
The Accuwell 17α-Hydroxyprogesterone EIA Kit contains the following:
• Microplates coated with rabbit anti-17-OHP.
• Enzyme conjugate which contains 17-OHP derivative conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase.
• Conjugate diluent which contains tris-buffer, bovine serum and
preservatives.
• Wash buffer concentrate which is a concentrated solution of phosphate
buffered saline containing a surfactant.
• Color developer which contains 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine in a
diluted organic solvent with citrate buffer and hydrogen peroxide.
• Stopping reagent which is a dilute solution of sodium fluoride and a red
dye.
• Multi-Analyte standards (0, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 250 ng/mL) serum
equivalents. Each card of standards is made from human whole blood,
adjusted to a hematocrit of 55% and each level is then spotted onto
Whatman 903 specimen collection paper.
• Controls (15, 40 and 90 ng/mL) serum equivalent. Each control card is
made from human whole blood, adjusted to a hematocrit of 55% and
each level is then spotted onto Whatman specimen collection paper.
Human source material was tested and found negative for HIV 1 and 2, HBV and
HCV using FDA approved methods.

L. Test Principle:
The samples can be processed with two different methods; (1) a 1/8 inch disc
from each blood spot is placed directly into designated wells of the coated
microplate with an overnight incubation, (2) An elution is done using an 1/8
inch disc from each blood spot which is placed in the designated well of an
uncoated microplate and saline is added to elute the blood from the dried blood
spot. A portion of the eluate is then transferred into a designated well of the
coated microplate with an overnight incubation or for 3 hours.
The Accuwell 17α-hydroxyprogesterone immunoassay (EIA) is based on the
competition principle. An unknown amount of antigen present in the sample and
a fixed amount of enzyme labeled antigen compete for the binding sites of the
antibodies coated onto the wells. After incubation the wells are washed to stop
the competition reaction and the color developer is added. The color
development is terminated by the addition of the stopping reagent and the
absorbance measured at 650 nm and is inversely proportional to the amount of
the antigen in the sample. Results of samples can be determined directly using
the standard curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was assessed using three neonatal dried bloodspots prepared by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Neonatal Screening Quality
Control Program. Samples were prepared using three different assay
procedures: Over night Eluate (ON Eluate), Three hour Eluate (3 Hr Eluate)
and Over Night Direct (ON Direct). Each of these samples was assayed in
duplicate once a day for 20 days. Results are presented in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the Accuwell 17-OHP measurement was demonstrated by
spiking four serum samples with purified analyte to concentrations of 3.8,
10, 25 and 300 ng/mL. Samples were inter-diluted to make a total of twelve
levels with a range between 3.8 - 300 ng/mL. Each sample was combined
with lysed, commercially obtained, human, red blood cells to obtain an
equivalent hematocrit of 55%. The samples were the spotted onto filter
paper and dried. Each sample was tested in quadruplicate for each assay
procedure and the average recovery was calculated and plotted against the
targeted recoveries. Linear regression of comparison data yielded the
following relationship:
ON Eluate - y = 1.0083x-1.3865 r = 0.9998
3 Hr Eluate - y = 1.1015x – 4.7189 r = 0.997
ON Direct - y = 1.1146x-4.9283 r = 0.997
The reportable range for the Accuwell 17-OHP measurements is 3.8-250
ng/mL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The standards and controls are prepared using commercially available
human serum stripped of the analyte then purified 17-OHP analyte is added
gravimetrically to various concentrations. Each serum concentration is then
mixed with lysed red blood cells to a hematocrit concentration equivalent to
55%. The blood mixtures are then spotted onto filter paper in ½ inch circles.
The spotted cards are randomly selected throughout the lot and the

concentrations tested. Each new lot of cards is tested against a standard
curve prepared from the previously approved lots.
The stability of the standards and controls were determined by studies that
support the expiration date of 12 months.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of the blank was determined by calculating 2 SD from the mean of
n=26 sample aliquots (zero standard) in one run on a single day using each
of the three assay procedures. The analytical sensitivity was estimated to be
2.2 ng/mL for the Over night Eluate, 1.5 ng/mL 3 Hour Eluate and 2.3
ng/mL Over Night Direct.
e. Analytical specificity:
Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could
interfere with the method. Hemoglobin up to 1200 mg/dL, bilirubin,
conjugated and unconjugated up to 300 mg/dL, and lipids up to 1875 mg/dL
caused no detectable interference.
Cross-reactivity was assessed by testing compounds whose structures could
potentially cause interference. The lists of compounds tested are listed
below:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
In a separate study of 444 infants whose samples were collected for testing at 1-
3days of age and whose birth weights were > 2500 gm, 17-OHP concentrations
were measured using each of the Accuwell 17-OHP methods. Samples were
collected on S&S filter paper no. 903 and stored for up to 7 months prior to
Accuwell testing. Based on the results obtained, the sponsor provides the
following guidelines in the labeling for samples taken at 1-3 days of age from
babies with birth weights > 2500 gm. The data show the cut-off values at which
re-testing or other follow-up should be considered.

The values shown here should be used only as a guideline, and were calculated
based on a specific population of samples as defined by the manufacturer. The
sponsor recommends in the labeling that each laboratory should establish its
own cut-off values for 17-OHP in its own population.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
