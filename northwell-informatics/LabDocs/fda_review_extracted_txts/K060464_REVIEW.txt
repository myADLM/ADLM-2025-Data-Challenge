510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
K060464
B. Purpose for Submission:
The parameter RDW-SD (Red Cell Distribution Width-Standard Deviation) is being
added to the Coulter 5C Cell Control.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Beckman Coulter, Inc., Coulter 5C Cell Control is intended to be used on a new
automated hematology analyzer called the Coulter LH780 which will be capable of
analyzing the RDW-SD parameter.
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Coulter 5C Cell Control is a quality control material for the parameters WBC, RBC,
HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW, RDW-SD, PLT, MPV, Ly%, Mo%, Ne%,
Eo%, Ba%, Ly#, Mo#, Ne#, Eo#, and Ba#.
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
5C Cell Control is a hematology quality control mixture intended to be used with
automated cell counters and differential cell counters. It is prepared from stabilized
human blood so that repeated measurements by an automated cell counter, or
differential cell counter, can be made to monitor instrument daily performance. 5C
Cell Control consists of treated stabilized human erythrocytes, a stabilized platelet
sized component, and fixed erythrocytes that simulate leukocytes. Three levels of
vaying component concentrations (Abnormal II, Abnormal I, and Normal) are
offered.

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
For Open Vial Stability and Closed Vial Stability, a total of nine lots of 5C
Controls were tested through expiration starting near the end of the product’s
shelf life. Two tubes per level (3) were evaluated. Open Vial Stability was
determined to be 13 events over 13 days when stored at 2-8o C. Closed Vial
Stability was determined to be 95 days when stored at 2-8o C.
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
L. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
a substantial equivalence decision.
