L. Test Principle:
Quantitative measurement of glucose in whole blood with an electrochemical biosensor
begins when a drop of blood is introduced on the side of the test strip. The electrons
produced from the reaction form a current. Under the potential provided from the meter, a
current is generated from the electrons produced during glucose oxidation. The current is
calibrated to measure the glucose concentration in the whole-blood sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-day imprecision was evaluated by spiking venous whole blood samples to
provide 5 levels of glucose concentration. Each sample was tested ten times using ten
different meters (100 measurements for each of the five levels for 500 total
measurements). Three different lots of reagent (test strips) were used. Results are
summarized below:
Interval 1 Interval 2 Interval 3 Interval 4 Interval 5
30-50 mg/dL 51-110 mg/dL 111-150 mg/dL 151-250 mg/dL 251-400 mg/dL
Mean 41.8 91.1 143.0 239.6 364.6
SD 2.03 2.76 3.53 6.65 6.48
% CV 4.85 3.03 2.47 2.77 1.78
n 100 100 100 100 100
Day to day imprecision was evaluated by testing 3 levels of control solutions using 10
different meters for 10 days. Each of the 3 control solutions was tested on all 10
meters each day, for 300 total measurements. Three different lots of reagent (test
strips) were used. Results are summarized below:
Low control Normal control High control
Mean 83.5 148.1 332.5
SD 3.46 3.81 5.39
% CV 4.15 2.58 1.62
n 100 100 100
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Spiked recovery was evaluated by preparing spiked glucose samples across the
measuring range (20-600 mg/dL). Whole blood was depleted of glucose by allowing
it to sit at room temperature. The blood was then spiked to 9 targeted glucose
concentrations (20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 200, 320, 420, and 600 mg/dL). Values were

verified using a YSI-2300 glucose analyzer. Each sample was measured 10 times on
the Prodigy meter. The mean of each sample was plotted against the YSI-2300 value
with a resultant regression equation of y = 1.00097x + 1.3134, r = 0.9978.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Two levels of control material (normal and high) are provided for use with the test
system. The controls are prepared gravimetrically in an aqueous matrix. Expected
values are verified for each manufactured lot. The open and closed stability were
tested.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range of the assay is 20-600 mg/dL. See linearity study above.
e. Analytical specificity:
The hematocrit effect was evaluated at 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60% hematocrit
levels. Samples in the five different concentrations were measured by using YSI-
2300 as a reference method. The results of mean difference analysis showed no
significant hematocrit effect from 20% to 60% for samples with glucose
concentration levels from 40 to 440 mg/dL. The sponsor defined significant effect as
glucose value ± 15 mg/dL at concentrations < 75 mg/dL and glucose value ± 20% at
concentrations ≥ 75 mg/dL.
Altitude showed no significant effect up to 10, 744 feet. The sponsor defined
significant effect as glucose value ± 15 mg/dL at concentrations < 75 mg/dL and
glucose value ± 20% at concentrations ≥ 75 mg/dL.
The sponsor tested the effects of temperature, humidity, and resistance to drop and
vibration on the meter’s performance. The sponsor claims that there is no effect of
these factors on glucose results (defined as within ± 15 mg/dL difference in samples
below 75 mg/dL and within ± 20% in samples above 75 mg/dL and repeatability of
< 5% CV at all glucose levels before and after each challenge).
The sponsor tested 6 exogenous and 2 endogenous substances for interference with
their meter. No interference (defined as ≤ 10%) was seen up to the following
concentrations:
Acetaminophen – up to 5 mg/dL
Ascorbic acid – up to 2.25 mg/dL
Dopamine – up to 2 mg/dL
L-dopa – up to 3 mg/dL

--- Page 6 ---
Methyl dopa – up to 0.5 mg/dL
Tolbutamide – up to 200 mg/dL
Uric acid – up to 10 mg/dL
Triglyceride – up to 2000 mg/dL
The package insert states that no interferences are seen at normal physiological levels
of these potential interferents as the levels at which interference is seen are above the
normal observed physiological concentrations of these substances.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Lay users (n = 120) were given the instructions for use and asked to fill out a
questionnaire related to the readability of the Owner’s Manual and ease of use of the
meter. The evaluation results were acceptable. The lay users obtained blood samples
from the fingertip using the device and the results were compared to the results
obtained on the YSI-2300. The YSI-2300 vs. lay user regression statistics are as
follows: y = 1.036x – 8.087, r = 0.969, for samples ranging in glucose concentration
from 29 mg/dL to 441 mg/dL.
In order to assess the accuracy of palm site testing compared to fingertip testing,
samples were taken by healthcare professionals from the fingertip and palm of 120
subjects at time of steady state (more than 2 hours since the last meal) and run on the
Prodigy meter. The palm vs. fingertip regression statistics on the Prodigy meter are as
follows: y = 0.9912x – 4.4171, for samples ranging in glucose concentration from 29
mg/dL to 441 mg/dL.
A consumer study was performed to evaluate the use of the Prodigy meter using the
palm as an alternative site. The studies were conducted at time of steady state. Sixty
lay users read the Owner’s Manual, obtained palm blood samples and performed the
blood glucose test on the Prodigy meter. The lay users also obtained fingertip blood
samples and performed the blood glucose test on the Prodigy meter. The lay users
also filled out a questionnaire related to the ease of obtaining and measuring the
sample from the palm. The results of the questionnaire were acceptable. The lay user
palm vs. lay user fingertip glucose regression statistics are as follows: y = 1.0368x –
3.9975, r = 0.9847, for samples ranging in glucose concentration from 45 mg/dL to
401 mg/dL.
