The Ascensia CONTOUR Blood glucose meter measures the electrical current
generated from the reaction of glucose with reagents on the electrode of the test strip.
Glucose in the blood sample reacts with FAD glucose dehydrogenase and potassium
ferricyanide in the test strip, generating electrons that produce a current that is
proportional to the glucose in the sample.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The intra assay precision of the device was evaluated by assaying 5 whole
blood specimens at different concentrations (50-325 mg/dL) within one run
using 10 meters. The results are presented in the table below:
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Level 5

% CV
Range %CV 2.5 - 3.5 1.1 – 1.8 0.4 – 2.7 1.1 – 1.9 0.8 – 2.2
Inter assay precision was evaluated by assaying 3 control solutions of
different concentrations (30-350 mg/dL) once a day for 10 days using 10
meters. The results are presented in the table below:
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3
N 100 100 100
Grand Mean (mg/dL) 39 116 356
Pooled SD 0.8 1.5 5.4
Pooled %CV 2.0 1.3 1.5
Range %CV 1.2 – 3.0 0.9 – 1.6 1.0 – 2.0
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the glucose measurements was demonstrated by comparing 92
prepared blood samples on the Ascensia Contour meter and the YSI method.
The concentration range of the samples was 10-609 mg/dL. Linear regression
of comparison data yielded the following relationship:
y = 0.986(x) – 2.0, r2 = .997
The reportable range is 10-600 mg/dL

Traceability is referenced to the NIST SRM 917a (dry D-glucose).
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit is 10 mg/dL. See the linearity study in b. above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference of the assay was assessed by spiking various endogenous and
exogenous compounds into prepared whole blood samples. The sponsor
prepared a low whole blood sample at approximately 80 mg/dL and a high
whole blood sample at approximately 350 mg/dL. The sponsor then added the
interfering substance and ran each sample on the Ascensia Contour meter. The
results are presented in the table below:
Substance Concentration Sponsor’s
Allowable Bias
Bilirubin 20 mg/dL 15%
Acetaminophen 20 mg/dL 20%
Uric Acid 15 mg/dL 20%
Ascorbic Acid 5 mg/dL 15%
Maltose 200 mg/dL 7%
Galactose 200 mg/dL 7%
The sponsor presented data that supported using the test system between 10ºC
to 40ºC.
Hematocrit Effect:
The effect of sample hematocrit variation on the Ascensia Contour test system
was tested by comparing the glucose result to the hematocrit value obtained
both during the laboratory and the clinical study. A laboratory study was
conducted to show performance at lower glucose concentrations with different
hematocrits. Six blood samples at glucose concentrations between 10-60
mg/dL were adjusted to the following hematocrit levels 40%, 55% and 70%
and tested in 72 replicates. The results met the sponsor’s acceptance criterion
of >95% of readings within ±15 mg/dL of the reference method. The
comparison to the YSI plasma (x) values resulted in the following regression
equations:
40% hematocrit Y = 0.918(x) – 1.272, r2 = 0.995
55% hematocrit Y = 0.875(x) +0.632, r2 = 0.994
70% hematocrit Y= 0.781(x) +8.665, r2 = 0.984
In another laboratory study, the effect of hematocrit was assessed using three
lots of test strips with whole blood at four plasma glucose concentrations of
50, 100, 200 and 400 mg/dL adjusted to three hematocrit levels of 20% 40%

and 60%. The normalized bias from YSI at 40% hematocrit levels is as
follows:
20% Hematocrit 60% Hematocrit
YSI glucose Modified strip Bias Modified strip Bias
50 55 10% 53 6%
100 110.1 10% 91.2 - 8.8%
200 242.3 21% 165.7 - 17.1%
400 473.3 18% 291.8 - 27.1%
In the lay user study, samples were assayed using the Ascensia Contour
modified test strip and compared to the YSI reference method. The glucose
concentrations ranged from 53 mg/dL to 489 mg/dL and the hematocrits
ranged from 29% to 59%. The data showed that 96.1% of the results were
within ±15 mg/dL or 20% of the laboratory glucose method.
The claimed range for Hematocrit is 20~60%. A limitation is included in the
labeling: “At glucose ranges above 200 mg/dL, hematocrit levels above 55%
will cause lowered results.”

Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Accuracy was based on the ISO International Standard 15197. Acceptable
accuracy for results shall be: 95% of the individual results shall fall within
+15 mg/dL at glucose concentration <75 mg/dL and within 20% at glucose
concentration >75 mg/dL. One hundred and six (106) capillary blood samples

reference method. Three lots of test strips were tested with each participant;
two replicates per lot for a total of 636 fingerstick readings. The sample range
was from 58 to 485 mg/dL. Results are shown in the tables below:
