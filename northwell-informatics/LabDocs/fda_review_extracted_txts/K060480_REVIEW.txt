Coated microwells are used as the solid phase separation system. The system is
comprised of three main elements:
- The VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Cortisol Reagent Pack, VITROS
Immunodiagnostic Products Cortisol Calibrators (cleared under k983990) and
VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Metabolism Controls (cleared under k983990),
which are combined by the VITROS Immunodiagnostic System to perform the
VITROS Cortisol assay.
- The VITROS Immunodiagnostic System – instrumentation, which provides
automated use of the immunoassay kits. The VITROS Immunodiagnostic System was
cleared for market by a separate 510(k) pre- market notification (k962919).
- Common reagents used by the VITROS System in each assay. The VITROS
Immunodiagnostic Products Signal Reagent and VITROS Immunodiagnostic
Products Universal Wash Reagent were cleared as part of the VITROS
Immunodiagnostic Products Total T3 Reagent Pack and VITROS Immunodiagnostic
Products Total T3 Calibrators 510(k) premarket notification (k964310).
Note: High Sample Diluent B was cleared as part of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic

L. Test Principle:
A competitive immunoassay technique is used. This depends on competition between
Cortisol present in the sample with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled Cortisol
conjugate for a limited number of binding sites on a biotinylated sheep anti-cortisol
polyclonal antibody. The antigen-antibody complex is captured by streptavidin on the
wells.Unbound materials are removed by washing.
A reagent containing luminogenic substrates (a luminol deriative and a peracid salt) and
an electron transfer agent (a substitued acetanilide) is added to the wells. The HRP in the
bound conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative, producing light. The
electron transfer agent increases the level and duration of the light produced. The light
signals are read by the VITROS Immunodiagnostic System. The amount of HRP
conjugate bound is inversely proportional to the concentration of Cortisol present in the
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated following CLSI (formerly NCCLS) EP5-A2. Two
replicates of each of 3 freeze-dried control sera were assayed on 2 separate
occasions per day on at least 20 different days. An identical experiment was
performed for urine (including the urine extraction pretreatment steps) to
assess precision for urine samples. The experiments were performed using 2

using a single lot of reagent over a single calibration interval.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The measuring range of the VITROS Cortisol assay is 4.39 nmol/L to 1700
nmol/L. Linearity of the assay was evaluated using protocols based on CLSI
(formerly NCCLS) EP6-A. Two plasma sample pools were prepared with
Cortisol titers near zero and at the high end of the range. A Cortisol stock
solution was prepared in methanol. The high pool (pool 11) was prepared by
mixing donor samples with an additional spike of Cortisol. The low pool (pool
1) was prepared from charcoal stripped plasma. The low and high

* Extrapolated values – concentration greater than highest calibrator. The
reference calibrators consist of seven levels (0, 14, 82, 659, 1267 and 1725
nmol/L) so a Master Curve is calibrated for each Master Lot up to 1725
nmol/L. The customer calibrators consist of three levels (0, 125 and 750
nmol/L) and recreate the lot specific Master Curve on the customer’s
instrument when a calibration is run.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Both the Calibrators and Metabolism Controls are value-assigned by
performing mulitple determinations using several VITROS Immunodiagnostic
Systems. The Calibrators are traceable to in-house reference calibrators,
which have been value-assigned to correlate to samples measured by gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry. The calibration and curve-shape for the
VITROS Cortisol assay is defined by a set of Reference Calibrators in the
Reference Calibration Curve (RCC).
There are two types of magnetic cards provided to the customer with every
calibrator pack. These are the lot calibration card and the protocol card. The
lot calibration card contains encoded data which is specific to a lot of
reagents, for example the master calibration data. The protocol card contains
encoded information that allows the System to process the assay associated
with the calibrators, for example assay incubation times and sample volumes.

The Reagent Packs and Calibrators were subjected to simulated transport
conditions. The data in this report supported the stability of the VITROS
Cortisol reagent pack and calibrators up to the Week 22 timepoint when stored
at 2-8°C. Therefore a shelf life of 16 Weeks is claimed for the reagent pack
and calibrator when stored at 2-8°C.
VITROS Cortisol Calibrators consist of three levels with nominal values of 0,
125 and 750 nmol/L cortisol. VITROS Metabolism controls consist of three
levels with nominal values of 90, 250 and 750 nmol cortisol/L.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor defined analytical sensitivity as the concentration calculated from
the mean light unit minus two standard deviations of a sample containing no
analyte, where 20 replicates were determined. The analytical sensitivity of this
assay is 3 nmol/L.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was evaluated using five plasma pools
spiked with cortisol resulting in concentrations of 4.39, 10.5, 17.2, 17.3 and
23.1 nmol/L. Ten consecutive replicates of the samples were performed twice.
Three Master Lots and three VITROS Immunodiagnostic Systems were used
during the study for at least three days using three different calibrations. Each
run included singleton determination of the Calibrators and QC in-house
controls. The lowest sample from the the concentrations tested giving accurate
precision (defined as CV < 15%) was 4.39 nmol/L. The LoQ for this assay is
4.39 nmol/L (the LoQ is the low end of the reportable range of the assay).
e. Analytical specificity:
Specificity of the VITROS Cortisol assay was evaluated by testing the
following substances as recommended by CLSI (formerly NCCLS) Protocol
EP7-A. They were found not to interfere (defined as bias <10%) with the
assay at a cortisol concentration of 241 to 288 nmol/L (8.74 to 10.4 mg/dL).
Interferent testing was conducted by preparing stock solutions of the
interferent. The stock solution was added to the VITROS Metabolism
Control, Level 2 with a nominal value of 250 nmol/L. The corresponding
control pool was prepared by reconstituting the VITROS Metabolism Control,
Level 2 with water or with water/solvent (at the same ratio as the test
substance pool, but without the test substance). The analyte levels present in
the control sample were established using the VITROS Cortisol assay on the
VITROS Immunodiagnostic System.

To evaluate the cross reactivity of prednisolone, 11-deoxycortisol, cortisone,
and corticosterone in the VITROS Cortisol assay, three determinations at each
dilution were made and analyzed as a percent cross-reactivity at 50% of zero
standard binding of cortisol compared with the concentration at 50%
displacement for the cross-reactant. The cross-reactivity at 50% displacement
is defined as the point where the reduction in signal corresponds to 50% of the
signal achieved in the absence of analyte, shown as a percentage of the analyte
concentration giving the same fall in signal. For the remaining cross-reactants,
the mean value of three determinations was compared with the concentration
of the cross-reactant used for the test:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The serum expected ranges, 123 to 626 nmol/L (obtained from 100 samples) and
46.2 to 389 nmol/L (obtained from 100 samples), were obtained from the sera of
apparently healthy patients sampled in the morning before 10:00 AM and in the
evening after 5 PM, respectively. The urine expected range is 35.7 to 699 nmol
cortisol/24 hours (obtained from 42 samples) was obtained from 24-hour urine
samples collected from apparently healthy patients.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
