L. Test Principle:
Not applicable.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The D-Glucose used in this control is traceable to an in-house glucose
preparation. Stability characteristics of the Liberty Glucose Control were
determined using the Arrhenius model of accelerated elevated temperature
and real time studies to determine estimated storage stability at 2 – 30 ºC.
Open vial stability was determined to be 90 days at 2-30 ºC.
The expected values were determined by repeat testing on the TheraSense
FreeStyle glucose monitor. Statistical analysis of the data was used to
determine the range for the monitor. Expected results may change with each
lot, but the control will list the range in the product insert. In addition, the
product insert alerts the user to use the range indicated in the control’s product
insert rather than the glucose test strip product’s insert.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Not applicable.
f. Assay cut-off:
