H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Dade® PFA-100® Platelet Function Analyzer and Dade® PFA-100® Reagents are in
vitro diagnostic devices intended to aid in the detection of platelet dysfunction in citrated
human whole blood.
2. Indication(s) for use:
To aid in the detection of platelet dysfunction in citrated human whole blood.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
4. Special instrument requirements:
I. Device Description:
The PFA-100® system provides a tool for clinicians to use in the detection of platelet
dysfunction induced by intrinsic platelet defects, von Willebrand factor (vWF) functional
deficiencies, or exposure to platelet inhibiting agents. The PFA-100® system simulates,
under high shear stress, the interaction of platelets with an injured blood vessel. These
conditions allow the PFA-100® system to measure in vitro platelet function as related to
primary hemostasis. The PFA-100® instrument determines the time from the start of the
test until the platelet plug occludes the aperture, and reports the time interval as the
Closure Time (CT).
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Dade® PFA-100® Platelet Function Analyzer and Dade® PFA-100® Reagents
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
K970505 & K002885
3. Comparison with predicate:
The PFA-100® system was described in detail and cleared under 510(k) Premarket
Notification Document Control No. K970505. Subsequently, the system was cleared for
a new indication, testing pediatric populations, under 510(k) Premarket Control No.
K002885.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
L. Test Principle:
The Dade® PFA-100® system measures the time required for platelets to adhere and
aggregate resulting in occlusion of an aperture under high shear conditions.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
* Note: Dade Behring, Inc. proposed modifications to the PFA-100® system based on literature
references published by independent organizations. The performance characteristics of
the instrument and reagents were not modified. The Clinical Performance section of
the Dade® PFA-100® Reagent package insert has been modified as follows:
(cid:131) The existing pediatric indication was modified to include more information
regarding the use of the device as a screening assay and to add information for
reference intervals for pediatric populations.
(cid:131) A new indication is added for using the PFA-100® system as a testing aid in the
management of desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) therapy.
