L. Test Principle:
The automated Dimension TACR method uses an immunoassay technique in which free and
tacrolimus-bound antibody-enzyme conjugates are separated using magnetic particles. The
assay is performed using a method specific Flex reagent cartridge.
To perform the TACR assay, a sample cup containing the whole blood sample to be
analyzed and a TACR Flex reagent cartridge are placed on the Dimensionsystem. The
Dimensionsystem mixes and lyses the whole blood sample. The lysed sample is then mixed
with the antibody enzyme conjugate. The tacrolimus present in the sample is bound by the
tacrolimus antibody conjugate reagent. Magnetic particles coated with tacrolimus are added
to bind free (unbound) antibody-enzyme conjugate. The reaction mixture is then separated
magnetically. Following separation, the supernatant containing the tacrolimus-antibody-
enzyme complex is transferred to another cuvette and mixed with the substrate. ß-
galactosidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of CPRG (chlorophenol red ß-d-galactopyranoside) to
produce CPR (chlorophenol red) that absorbs light maximally at 577 nm. The change in
absorbance at 577 nm due to the formation of CPR is directly proportional to the amount of
tacrolimus in the patient’s sample and is measured using a bichromatic (577, 700 nm) rate
technique.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
An internal site precision study was conducted using whole blood samples from
patients taking tacrolimus. Three patient samples were chosen having low, mid and
high levels. Twenty replicates of each patient sample were analyzed in one run

b. Linearity/assay reportable range
Linearity was assessed with samples prepared using the tacrolimus calibrator level
5 (35.8 ng/mL) and calibrator level 1 (0.0 ng/mL) to produce concentrations
evenly distributed across the assay range. Standard solutions were prepared by
sequentially mixing a high calibrator (35.8 ng/mL) and a low (0 ng/mL) calibrator
to create a set of samples pools with concentrations of 35.8, 28.7, 21.5, 14.3, 7.2
and 0 ng/mL. The mean observed result (y) was compared to the expected
concentration (x) and plotted. The linear regression equation was y=1.0277x +
0.43 with a correlation coefficient of 0.9909. The sponsor demonstrated that the
assay is linear across the measuring range of 1.2 – 30.0 ng/mL.
A high sample dilution study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of results
when a high sample is diluted with tacrolimus-negative EDTA whole blood or the
Dimension Tacrolimus Calibrator (0 ng/mL). Five transplant patient negative
samples were spiked with a tacrolimus methanol stock solution to a concentration
of 60 ng/mL. Each spiked sample was assayed twice in replicates of 5 in either 1:2
or 1:4 dilutions with either negative whole blood or the Dimension Tacrolimus
zero calibrator. The diluted samples were assayed five times.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Real- time stability studies were conducted on the Dimension TACR Flex
reagent cartridge. The studies met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria and
supported the:
• 12 month shelf life for the reagent when stored at 2-8˚C
• the 30 days stability for sealed or unhydrated wells on the instrument
• the 48 hours stability once wells 1-6 are entered by the instrument and
• the 6 days stability once wells 7 and 8 are opened.
The sponsor conducted a freeze-thaw study using four (4) whole blood samples of
varying levels of tacrolimus from transplant patients. The frozen samples were
thawed and assayed in triplicate to determine their mean tacrolimus concentration.
The samples were re-frozen at -20°C, thawed, assayed in triplicate and the mean
tacrolimus concentration calculated. The mean tacrolimus concentrations were
compared. The percent difference between the mean concentrations was

d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity (Limit of the Blank) of the TACR method was
determined by assaying 20 replicates of the tacrolimus negative calibrator. The
sponsor defined analytical sensitivity as the concentration at two standard
deviations above the 0.0 ng/mL Level 1 Calibrator and represented the lowest
concentration of tacrolimus that can be distinguished from 0 with a confidence of
95%. Based on the studies that were conducted the analytical sensitivity is 1.2
ng/mL.
A functional sensitivity study was conducted using 9 whole blood spiked pools
(values ranging from 0.3 to 25.5 ng/mL). The sponsor defined functional
sensitivity as the lowest drug concentration for which acceptable assay precision is
noted. The study was conducted over 20 days, 2 runs per day with samples run in
duplicate (n=80). The mean, standard deviation and %CV (y) were calculated and
plotted against the mean of the test sample (y). The regression line of y=-0.4385x
– 0.8766 was obtained. The analyte concentration corresponding to a 20% CV is
2.4 ng/mL. Based on the studies conducted, the functional sensitivity is 2.4
ng/mL.
The potential for a high dose hook effect was evaluated by preparing serial
dilutions of concentrated tacrolimus stock solution in methanol. The final dilutions
(35.8, 60.0, 80.0, 90.0 and 100 ng/mL) were prepared using EDTA whole blood
hemolysate.and assayed in duplicate. The mean observed results were compared
against the instrument response for the level 5 calibrator. Each mean observed
result was higher than the level 5 calibrator and the instrument produced error
messages for the high concentration samples indicating that there is no high dose
hook effect or this assay up to 100 ng/mL.

e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor evaluated the effects of potential interferents on assay performance.
The sponsor conducted an interference study on endogenous compounds,
commonly co-administered drugs, including four immunosuppressive drugs and
anticoagulants.
A sample was prepared containing the endogenous compound in the presence of
10 ng/mL tacrolimus in negative whole blood hemolysate. All samples were
assayed five times and the mean was calculated. At the concentration tested, these
compounds did not cause significant interference (defined by the sponsor as
±10%). The results are presented in the table below:

The sponsor evaluated potential cross-reactivity of eight major tacrolimus
metabolites by using whole blood with tacrolimus spiked in at 10 ng/mL. For
each metabolite, two aliquots were prepared with 50 ng/mL of the metabolite

The sponsor conducted a study to examine the interference from commonly co-
administered drugs including 4 immunosupressive drugs - cyclosporine,
mycophenolic acid and its metabolite MPAG, and rapamycin. A sample was
prepared containing the co-administered drug in the presence of 10 ng/mL
tacrolimus in negative whole blood. This sample was compared to a control
which contained only 10 ng/mL tacrolimus in whole blood. All samples were
assayed five times. At the concentrations tested, the co-administered drugs did
not cause significant interference (defined by the sponsor as ±10% of the
control). A complete list of the compounds is contained in the package insert.
The sponsor recommends that a trough sample should be drawn using EDTA as
the anticoagulant. Samples collected in heparin are not recommended because
they may form clots during storage. This recommendation is referenced in the

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor references the Consensus Document (published in 1995) that describes
targets for 12 –hour trough whole-blood concentrations and references the Fujisama
Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.’s interpretation of the PDR which describes co-medication
interference. The described tacrolimus trough range (from 5 to 20 ng/mL) depends on
the transplant type, stage after transplantation, and the medical practice. Higher or
lower concentrations may be associated with an increase in the incidence of adverse
effects. Blood levels can be affected by co-medications. Patients treated with viral
protease inhibitors for HIV infection may have dramatically altered metabolism of
tacrolimus, which may cause elevation of tacrolimus to at least 100 ng/mL, and
would require novel dosing. Tacrolimus is extensively metabolized by the liver.
Therefore, circulating tacrolimus levels may be influenced by drugs that affect hepatic
microsomal enzymes, particularly the cytochrome P450 system. Substances know to
inhibit these enzymes will decrease hepatic metabolism and increase tacrolimus
levels.

Therapeutic ranges vary according to the commercial test used, and the sponsor
recommends that ranges should be established for each commercial test. Values
obtained with different assay methods cannot be used interchangeably due to
differences in assay methods and cross-reactivity with metabolites, nor should
correction factors be applied. Therefore, the sponsor recommends consistent use of
one assay for individual patients.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
