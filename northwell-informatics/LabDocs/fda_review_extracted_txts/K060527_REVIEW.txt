Buprenorphine/Norbuprenorphine Urine Test (Cassette and Dip-Strip)
G. Regulatory Information:
1. Regulation section:
21 CFR §862.3650, Opiate Test System
2. Classification:
Class II
3. Product code:
DJG
4. Panel:
Toxicology (91)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
This device is a qualitative immunoassay intended to detect buprenorphine (BUP)
and its metabolite, norbuprenorphine (NBUP) in human urine. Results are
preliminary positive when the combination of the concentrations of BUP and
NBUP is greater than 10 ng/ml. It is for health care professional use only.
This test provides only a preliminary result. A more specific alternate chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) or High Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse
test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are obtained.

2. Indication(s) for use:
See Intended Use above.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
A positive test result does not always mean an individual has taken the drug
illegally as the drug can be administered legally.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable. The device is a visually read single-use device.
I. Device Description:
This assay is a one-step lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay. The test strip
consists of 1) a burgundy-colored conjugate pad containing rabbit anti-buprenorphine
antibodies and mouse IgG coupled to colloidal gold; and 2) a nitrocellulose
membrane containing a Test (T) line and a Control (C) line. The T line is coated with
buprenorphine-BSA, and the C line is coated with goat anti-mouse IgG antibody.
This test is a competitive binding immunoassay. The buprenorphine and
norbuprenorphine in the urine specimen competes with the buprenorphine–BSA
antigen coated on the nitrocellulose membrane for the limited binding sites of the
conjugated anti-buprenorphine antibodies.
When an adequate amount of urine specimen is applied to the sample pad of the
device, the urine specimen migrates by capillary action through the test strip. If the
level of buprenorphine and / or norbuprenorphine in the urine specimen is below the
cutoff concentration (10 ng/ml), the T line appears as a visible burgundy line. If the
level of buprenorphine in the urine specimen is above the cutoff, no T line develops.
The C line will bind to the mouse IgG conjugate and form a burgundy color band
regardless of the presence of buprenorphine. The C line serves as an internal
qualitative control of the test system.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. This is a semi-quantitative device; a ‘positive’ result only
suggests that buprenorphine is present in quantities above the cutoff level.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This test contains a built-in control feature, the C line. The appearance of the
burgundy C line indicates an adequate volume of specimen has been absorbed
and the capillary flow through the test strip has occurred. The C line should
always appear. If the Control line does not develop within 5 minutes, the
sponsor suggests reviewing the entire procedure and repeating the test with a
new device.
The sponsor also recommends that users follow appropriate federal, state, and
local guidelines concerning the running of external quality controls.
d. Detection limit:
Sensitivity of qualitative assays may be characterized by validating
performance around the claimed cutoff concentration of the assay, and
demonstrating the lowest concentration of drug that is capable of or
consistently producing a positive result. This information appears the
Precision/Reproducibility section above.

f. Assay cut-off:
The stated cutoff of this assay is 10 ng/mL. Characterization of how the
device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff concentration appears
in the Detection limit section, above. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration (SAMHSA) has not recommended cutoff levels for
buprenorphine tests.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The accuracy of this device was evaluated using 54 clinical urine specimens
and 40 drug free urine samples with varying un-hydrolyzed concentrations of
both buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine in different ratios, each blind-
labeled. The results from this test device agreed 100% with the HPLC/MS
and GC/MS on the non-hydrolyzed specimens at levels below 75% of the
cutoff (negative) and above 125% of the cutoff (positive). Three (3)
discrepancies were observed on the specimens of
buprenorphine/norbuprenorphine at the level between 75% and 125% of the
cutoff. The overall agreement was 96.8% (3 discrepancies/94 specimens).
