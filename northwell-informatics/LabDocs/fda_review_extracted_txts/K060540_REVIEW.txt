4. Panel: 83
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Cepheid Xpert GBS performed on the GeneXpert Dx System is a qualitative in vitro
diagnostic test designed to detect Group B Streptococcus (GBS) DNA from vaginal/rectal
swab specimens, using fully automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with
fluorogenic detection of the amplified DNA.2. Indication(s) for use:
2. Indications for use:
Xpert GBS Assay testing is indicated for rapid identification of antepartum and intrapartum
GBS colonization.
• The use of the Xpert GBS for intrapartum screening should not preclude the use of other
strategies (e.g., antepartum testing). Intrapartum Xpert GBS results are useful to identify
candidates for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis when administration of intravenous
antibiotics is not delayed pending results.

• The Xpert GBS assay does not provide susceptibility results. Culture isolates are needed
for performing susceptibility testing as recommended for penicillin-allergic women.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription Use
4. Special instrument requirements: GeneXpert Dx System (instrument, computer, barcode
wand reader)
I. Device Description:
The Xpert GBS™ is a single-use cartridge with pre-packaged reagents for detection of GBS
DNA. After insertion of the specimen swab and provided reagents, the cartridge is processed by
the GeneXpert Dx System instrument. The cartridge contains an internal control and a system
control (probe check). Testing is completed in ~75 min. with results displayed in tabular and
graphic formats.
Each cartridge has 11 separate chambers, a syringe with plunger, a rotary valve for controlling
fluid movement, a filtration area for capturing, concentrating, washing and lysing, dry real-time
PCR reagents (primers and probe), an integrated PCR reaction tube that is automatically filled by
the instrument.
During sample preparation, bacterial cells are captured on a filter, cells are lysed by an ultrasonic
horn, and DNA is eluted. The eluate rehydrates dry PCR reagents. The reaction mixture is
transferred to a reaction tube for real-time PCR, alternate thermalcycling and fluorescent
detection. Dried PCR reagents (polymerase/inhibitor complex, primers for target and controls,
Taqman probes for target and controls), dNTPs, internal DNA control are freeze-dried on beads
within each cartridge. A sample processing control, B. globigii (~2000 spores) is also freeze-
dried on a bead contained within the cartridge.
The sample processing control (SPC) ensures correct processing of each sample by monitoring
the lysis and elution processing. The SPC may not amplify in a high-positive sample. An internal
control (IC), comprised of approximately 2250 copies of a linearized plasmid containing a 212
base pair chimeric construct (T. foetus /Y. enterocolitica), verifies functional PCR reagents and
the absence of inhibition that would prevent PCR amplification. A probe check feature built into
the GeneXpert instrument function before the start of the PCR reaction, measures the
fluorescence signal from the probes to monitor bead rehydration, reaction-tube filling, probe
integrity and dye stability.
The GenXpert Dx System instrument has 4 randomly accessible modules. Additionally a
barcode wand reader can be used to identify and track specimen IDs and results. Copan Venturi
Transystem Culture Swab and Transport System is used for specimen collection.

L. Test Principle:
The Xpert GBS Test uses real-time PCR adapted to an automated instrument system that
integrates sample processing (lysis and DNA purification) in a cartridge that contains freeze-
dried PCR reagents and process controls for real-time PCR detection. This integration of nucleic
acid extraction reduces labor-intensive steps requiring specially trained personnel and also
reduces likelihood of cross-contamination and technician-dependent variability. Sonication,
integrating ultrasonic energy and glass beads, mechanically lyses cells from specimen material.
The Xpert GBS Target region is a 3’ untranslated region of the cfb gene. Subsequent to
identification of target sequences, a report suggests that the target is an open reading frame
adjacent to, rather than the cfb gene itself. The resulting amplicon is 132 bp. Probes are labeled
with FAM (5’) and QSY7 quencher (3’). Note: Primers are 23 mer (Tm 72.6. 52.2% GC) and 9
mer (70.0 Tm, 57.9 %GC) while the GBS probe is 27 mer (73.5 Tm, 44.4 %GC). Cycling
parameters are 3 min at 95º (denaturation), followed by 45 cycles of 5 s at 95º, 20s at 60º, and 18
s 73º.

The GenXpert® instrument has 4 modules, each with an I-Core for thermal cycling and real-time
detection of PCR amplicons. Each of the 4 modules is controlled independently, allowing for
specimens to be loaded and tested when received, rather than batching. Each of the 4 modules
in addition to the I-Core, has a syringe drive for aspirating and dispensing fluids, a valve drive
for chamber access, and an ultrasonic horn for lysis. Prior to operation, a self-test verifies heater,
fan and optics functionality, while the syringe drive, valve and ultrasonic horn current are
continuously checked.The GenXpert can simultaneously detect signal from up four different
spectral bands.
Each I-core has two ceramic plates to assure temperature uniformity and rapid heat transfer.
Firmware controls the temperature inside by moving ambient air across the heater plates. Optics
consist of a 4-color excitor module (high intensity LEDs to excite reporter dye molecules) and a
4-color detector module (silicon photodetectors and filters to detect the 4 spectral bands).
Calibration and data analysis algorithms compensate for spectral overlap. Thermal reaction
chamber thermistors are calibrated to +0.50ºC and calibration coefficients correct for errors in
raw thermistor reads (stored in firmware). Individual dye-oligos signals are corrected using
spectral characteristics of pure dye-oligos after subtracting raw signal produced by a reaction
tube alone.
For the GBS application, three spectral signals are processed (separate dyes tagged to
oligonuclide probes for the SPC, IC, and the GBS). Two of the 3 signals are from fixed
components within the reagents, with one from unknown. Output results are color coded (red-
positive; green-negative; gray-invalid; gold-error); tabular and graphic formats are accessible by
password. Setup requires a surge protector and printer. A laptop preloaded with system and
other required software is provided (also power cord, ethernet cable, and barcode scanner).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A panel of specimens with varying concentrations of GBS and Lactobacillus acidophilus
(negative) were tested in triplicate on 10 different days at each of the three sites (4
specimens × 3 × 10 days × 3 sites). One lot of Xpert GBS kits was used at each of the 3
testing sites, according to the Xpert GBS procedure. All 360 Xpert GBS tests with all
samples yielded results that agreed with expected results.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Recommended external controls for testing contain approximately 100 CFU/swab and
should yield approximately a 34 Ct
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity, or limit of detection (LOD), was determined using 11 S.
agalactiae strains. Nine distinct GBS serotypes have been identified (Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V,
VII, and VIII). Most cases of neonatal sepsis caused by GBS are attributed to 1 of 4
serotypes: Ia, Ib, II, or III. GBS type V has emerged as an important cause of GBS
infection in the United States, and strains of types VI and VIII have become prevalent
among Japanese women.9 Quantitated cultures were tested in four replicates. The lowest
concentration of each subtype resulting in a positive result in all four replicates was 250
CFU/swab.
e. Analytical specificity:
Commercially obtained, purified genomic DNA from 101 strains representing 28
Streptococci, 73 other species including strains phylogenetically related to S. agalactiae,
other microflora (bacteria and yeasts) commonly found in vaginal and anal flora, and
human DNA were tested. Replicates of three were tested at 1.5 ng/25 μl reaction (~2 ×
105 equivalent genome copies per reaction). None of the 28 Streptococcal isolates (non-
GBS) tested positive. Of the remaining 73 strains, four (Enterococcus gallinarium,
Staphylococcus simulans, Micrococcus luteus, and Propionibacterium acnes) were
weakly positive in one of six replicates.

3. Clinical studies:
The Xpert GBS Assay was evaluated at six institutions with maternity services in the United
States. Each institution had a culture-based or nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) based
screening program. Testing was done in clinical laboratories affiliated with each institution
as well as the labor and delivery area. Both intrapartum and antepartum subjects were
included in the study. To be enrolled in the intrapartum portion of the study, women had to
provide written consent, be in labor, and have no contraindication to vaginal examination (for
example, bleeding). To be enrolled in the antepartum portion of the study, women had to
provide written consent, be at 35-37 weeks gestation, and have no contraindication to vaginal
examination (for example, bleeding). There was also no evidence of placenta previa, no
urgent indication to proceed to delivery, and no antibiotic used in the week prior to admission
for all subjects.
Vaginal/rectal specimens were collected from each of 794 eligible subjects using two sets of
marked swabs (Cepheid GBS Collection Devices). One of the swabs from the first set was
used for culturing. The second set of marked swabs was divided: one swab was used in the
9

--- Page 10 ---
Xpert GBS Assay on the GeneXpert Dx System; the other was used in the 2nd NAAT assay.
The 2nd NAAT assay targets a sequence in the cfb gene and was previously FDA-cleared.
Results from this test were not used in performance estimations. After use in these tests, each
of these swabs was also placed into LIM culture broth, incubated, subcultured onto blood
agar plate (BAP) and observed for GBS.
Each institution used the culture technique recommended in the 2002 CDC guidelines:
microbiological culture in selective broth medium (LIM broth), followed by 18–24 h
incubation, and subculture onto BAP. Colonies consistent with GBS were specifically
identified by slide agglutination testing.
The performance of the Xpert GBS Assay relative to GBS status determined from laboratory
cultures of specimens from 794 maternity patients: 373 antepartum and 421 intrapartum.
Three women had no results by culture and were excluded from analyses (0 were Xpert GBS
positive and 3 were Xpert GBS negative), leaving 791 patients that could be evaluated. All
subjects had culturing done (as described above) and most also had a 2nd GBS NAAT
performed. The 2nd NAAT targets a sequence in the cfb gene and was previously FDA-
cleared; results from this test were not used in performance estimations. Of the 791 cases, the
Xpert GBS assay yielded 726 reportable results on the first attempt (91.8%). There were 65
non-reportable results (i.e., invalid, error, or no result); 55 of these cases resolved upon
repeat testing. Overall, 201 women had cultures positive for GBS, either from the single
swab used for culture or the eluted swabs from Xpert GBS and 2nd NAAT testing. The Xpert
GBS assay yielded 168 positive results initially (168/201, 83.6%). After repeat testing, the
positive results increased to 178/201, or 88.6%. 590 women had negative cultures and 520
were negative initially with Xpert GBS testing (88.1%), and 561 after repeat testing (95.1%).
The table below shows performance of Xpert GBS testing compared to positive and negative
GBS culture findings for 791 subjects (3 subjects had cultures that were overgrown or could
not be otherwise interpreted). Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive value
estimates shown are based on results after repeat testing.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Approximately 10–30% of pregnant women are colonized with GBS in the vagina and/or
rectum. GBS colonization can be transient, chronic, or intermittent. During clinical
evaluations for the Xpert GBS assay, 25.4% (201 of 791) women (antepartum and
intrapartum) were colonized with GBS by culture methods.

5. Calibration: Optical and thermal calibration of the GeneXpert Dx System is performed
by Cepheid at the time of manufacture prior to installation and once yearly or after 1000 runs per
module. The user does not calibrate or perform any serviceable functions on the instrument.
The normalization function compensates for any optical degradation between calibrations.
The thermal reaction chamber thermistors are calibrated to ± 0.50ºC using National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST)-traceable standards. During the manufacturing process, the
temperature of the heating system is measured at two temperatures: 60ºC and 95ºC. Calibration
coefficients that correct for small errors in the raw thermistor readings of the heaters are stored in
the memory of each I-CORE module.
The optical system is calibrated using standard concentrations of individual unquenched
fluorescent dye-oligos. For each optical channel, the signal produced by a tube alone (the blank
signal) is subtracted from the raw signal produced by the dye-oligo standard to determine the
spectral characteristics. Using the individual spectral characteristics of the pure dye-oligos,
signals from an unknown mixture of dye-oligos can be resolved into corrected signals for the
individual dye-oligos in the mixture.
6. Quality Control:
Before the start of the PCR reaction, the GeneXpert Dx System is programmed to perform a
probe check on the GBS target, CIC and SPC. The Probe Check control verifies reagent bead
rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability. PC is considered
to PASS if it meets the predetermined acceptance criteria. If the PC fails in GBS target, CIC or
SPC; the test will not continue.
