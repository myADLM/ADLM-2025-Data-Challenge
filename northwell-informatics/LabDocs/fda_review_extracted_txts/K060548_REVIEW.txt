1

--- Page 2 ---
quantitative measurement of the total beta subunit, vis, both the intact hCG dimer
and the free β subunit, of the human chorionic gonadotropin hormone in
heparinized plasma. βhCG is used for the early detection of pregnancy. This
method is for use by trained health care professionals in the clinical laboratory
and point of care (POC) settings.
The Stratus CS Acute Care™ βhCG Calibrator (βhCG CalPak) is an in vitro
diagnostic product intended to be used for calibration of the Stratus® CS Acute
Care™ βhCG method.
The Stratus CS Acute Care™ βhCG Dilution Pak (βhCG DilPak) is an in vitro
diagnostic product intended to be used in conjunction with the Acute Care™
βhCG TestPak for the measurement of samples with elevated levels of βhCG.
The Stratus CS Acute Care™ NT-proBNP method is an in vitro diagnostic test for
the quantitative measurement of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-
proBNP) in heparinized plasma. In individuals suspected of having congestive
heart failure (CHF), measurements of NT-proBNP are used as an aid in the
diagnosis and assessment of severity. The test is further indicated for the risk
stratification of patients with acute coronary syndrome and heart failure. This
method is for use by trained health care professionals in the clinical laboratory
and point of care (POC) settings.
The Stratus CS Acute Care™ NT-proBNP Calibrator (pBNP CalPak) is an in
vitro diagnostic product intended to be used for calibration of the Stratus® CS
Acute Care™ NT-proBNP (pBNP) method.
The Stratus CS Acute Care™ NT-proBNP Dilution Pak (pBNP DilPak) is an in
vitro diagnostic product intended to be used in conjunction with the Acute Care™
pBNP TestPak for the measurement of samples with elevated levels of NT-
proBNP.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Stratus® CS Analyzer
I. Device Description:
βhCG Method
The Stratus® CS Acute Care™ βhCG method is a solid phase, two-site sandwich
fluorometric immunoassay based upon Radial Partition Immunoassay (RPIA)
technology. In this procedure, dendrimer linked monoclonal βhCG antibody is added
to the center portion of a square piece of glass fiber paper in the βhCG TestPak. The
dendrimer binds electrostatically to the glass fibers and immobilizes the capture
antibody to the paper. Sample is then added, whereupon βhCG reacts with the
2

--- Page 3 ---
immobilized antibody. After a short incubation, a conjugate, consisting of enzyme-
labeled (alkaline phosphatase) monoclonal antibody directed against a distinct
antigenic site on the βhCG molecule, is pipetted onto the reaction zone of the paper.
During this second incubation period, the unbound, labeled antibody is radially eluted
with a wash solution. By including substrate (4-methylumbeliferyl phosphate) for the
enzyme within the wash solution, initiation of enzyme activity occurs simultaneously
with the wash. The enzymatic rate of the bound fraction increases directly with the
concentration of βhCG in the sample. Utilization of two monoclonal antibodies
which are specific for distinct antigenic sites on the β subunit of hCG allows the assay
to measure the total βhCG in the sample, vis, both the intact hCG dimer and the free β
subunit. Concentration is measured by an optical system that monitors the reaction
rate via front surface fluorescence. All data analysis functions are performed by the
microprocessor within the analyzer.
Calibrator
The Stratus® CS Acute Care βhCG calibrator (βhCG CalPak) contains human hCG in
a bovine serum matrix with preservatives. The βhCG CalPak is a single-use liquid
product which contains one calibrator level at an approximate concentration of 950
mIU/mL* [IU/L] in each of three wells. The kit consists of five CalPaks at a single
calibrator level.
Diluent
The Stratus® CS Acute Care βhCG Diluent (βhCG DilPak) contains a liquid buffered
bovine protein matrix with stabilizers and 0.09% sodium azide. The kit consists of 5
DilPaks with diluent in one well.
NT-proBNP Method
The Stratus® CS Acute Care™ NT-proBNP method is a two-site sandwich assay
based upon solid phase Radial Partition Immunoassay (RPIA) technology. In this
procedure, dendrimer linked polyclonal antibody is added to the center portion of a
square piece of glass fiber paper in the pBNP TestPak. This antibody recognizes a
distinct antigenic site on the NT-proBNP molecule. Sample is then added onto the
paper where it reacts with the immobilized antibody. After a short incubation, a
conjugate consisting of enzyme-labeled polyclonal antibody directed against a second
distinct antigenic site on the NT-proBNP molecule is pipetted onto the reaction zone
of the paper. During this second incubation period, enzyme-labeled antibody reacts
with the bound NT-proBNP, forming an antibody-antigen-labeled antibody sandwich.
The unbound labeled antibody is later eluted from the field of view of the Stratus CS
analyzer by applying a substrate wash solution to the center of the reaction zone. By
including substrate for the enzyme within the wash solution, initiation of enzyme
activity occurs simultaneously with the wash. The enzymatic rate of the bound
fraction increases directly with the concentration of NT-proBNP in the sample. The
reaction rate can then be measured by an optical system that monitors the reaction
rate via front surface fluorescence. All data analysis functions are performed by the
microprocessor within the analyzer.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To demonstrate that data generated by “non-laboratory” personnel is
comparable to precision and data generated by “laboratory” personnel, method
comparison and precision analysis were performed at three different locations:
the clinical laboratory (LAB), Emergency Department (ED) and Cardiac Care
Unit (CCU) at one external evaluation site for βhCG and two external
evaluation sites for NT-proBNP, using personnel representative of POC users.
βhCG
Method comparison studies were conducted at multiple sites in one institution
comparing the performance obtained with the Stratus® CS Acute Care™
βhCG and NT proBNP (pBNP) TestPaks with non-laboratory personnel
versus laboratory personnel. Data from non-laboratory personnel was
obtained in the Emergency Department (ED) and the Critical Care Unit
(CCU) at the evaluation sites. The results are summarized in the tables below:
