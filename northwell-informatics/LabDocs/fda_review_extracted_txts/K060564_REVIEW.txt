and software technology for the detection and genotyping of the Factor II
(Prothrombin)m G20210A mutation and the Factor V Leiden mutation from
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolated from human whole peripheral blood samples. The
INFINITI System is comprised of four components:
• BioFilmChip™ Microarray
• Intellipac™ Reagent Module
• INFINITI Analyzer
• Qmatic™ Operating Software
The BioFilmChip Microarray is a film-based microarray consists of multiple layers of
porous hydrogel matrix (8-10 um in thickness) coated on a polyester solid support. An
intermediate layer incorporates a proprietary material to reduce intrinsic fluorescence.
The top layer is designed for the immobilization of biomolecules such as oligonucleotides
to enable the genomic analysis on the same platform. There can be up to 240 spots per
microarray with each spot representing a different allele. The microarrays are designed
to be assay specific.

The Intellipac Reagent Module which acts as a communication link contains eight
reservoirs that house the test reagents and has an integrated 64K bit memory chip. The
assay protocol resides in this memory chip and upon request is loaded to the INFINITI
Analyzer.
The INFINITI Analyzer is an instrument used for clinical multiplex systems intended to
measure and sort multiple signals from a clinical sample. The INFINITI Analyzer is
designed to measure fluorescence signals of labeled DNA target hybridized to
BioFilmChip microarrays. The INFINITI Analyzer is completely self-contained and
automates the Factor II and Factor V assays. The INFINITI Analyzer integrates all the
discrete processes of sample handling, reagent management, hybridization, detection and
result analysis. The assays are processed automatically and read by the built-in
microscope.
The Qmatic operating software is a proprietary software module built into the INFINITI
Analyzer and manages the entire INFINITI System by integrating multiple processes
such as the multiplex assay protocol for Factor II and Factor V, fluid handling, robotics,
optical detection and results analysis.

L. Test Principle:
The INFINITI System assay for Factor II and Factor V is designed to simultaneously detect
mutations of two genes: Factor II (G20210A) and Factor V (G1691A). The assay protocol is
based on five major processes:
a) PCR amplification of purified DNA from human genomic DNA
b) Labeling of the amplified product (allele specific primer extension)
c) Hybridization of the labeled amplified product to a microarray by signature
Tag/Capture interaction iso conditions
d) Scanning of the microarray
e) Signal detection and analysis (determination of the Factor II and V genotypes_
Steps (b) through (e) are automated by the INFINITI Analyzer.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Determined at three clinical sites, with three different instruments, three days and
three different operators. Five replicates, each, of two genomic DNA samples were
tested by each site. Correct calls (first time) were 93%; after repeat run, 100% of
calls were correct.
Assay:
(Within chip): Using the same sample and three different instruments, one
heterozygous sample was repeated five scans on the same chip. Also within chip %
CVs, using three spots per mutation, were determined from three chips from one lot
and ranged from 0.6 – 39.1%. Each chip was read five times using one instrument.
The average of triplicate spots was provided for FV-W, FV-M, FII-W and FII-M.
(Chip-to-chip): Using the same sample and the same instrument, the assay was run
using three microarray chips from one lot of BioFilmChip Microarray five times
testing a known genomic sample (Factor II Wild, Factor V Wild). This was repeated
two other times, using a different instrument. The CVs using average triplicate spots
for each mutation ranged from 9 – 12% for wild-type present calls. All calls were
100% correct.
(Lot-to-lot): Five replicates, each, of two genomic DNA samples were sent to three
different clinical sites (three different instruments and operators) and analyzed. Two
lots of microarray chips and two lots of Intellipac reagents were used by the study
5

--- Page 6 ---
sites.
Because lot-to-lot comparison at the study sites involved only two lots of Intellipac
reagents and two lots of microarray chips, data from in-house testing was provided.
In-house tests were conducted with three lots of BioFilmChip microassays using the
same instrument four times, each time using a different sample. Two-way ANOVA
on the RFU reading did not detect lot-to-lot difference on three of the four test runs (p
> 0.05), and detected lot-to-lot difference on one test run (0.05 > p > 0.01). Genotype
calls were 100% correct.
Run 1: FV – Heterozygote; FII – Heterozygote
Run 2: FV – Heterozygote; FII – Wild Type
Run 3: FV – Wild Type; FII – Heterozygote
Run 4: FV – Wild Type; FII – Wild Type
(Day-to-day): To provide a comparison between days, a three-day reproducibility
study was performed in-house. A known genomic sample (Factor II Mutant and Factor V
Wild) was assayed 12 times on each of three days using one instrument. The RFU signal
%CV ranged from 1.35 to 14.87 on day 1, 0.77 to 19.72 on day 2 and 0.41 to 21.2 on day 3.
Genotype calls were 100% correct.
(Site-to-site):
To assess site-to-site reproducibility, three clinical sites representing three different
instruments, three different days and three different operators. The same two known
genomic DNA samples were tested by the three sites. The genotypes include (Factor
V Wild and Factor II Homozygous Mutant – same five replicates) and (Factor V Wild
and Factor II Wild - same five replicates). All genotype calls were correct. Results
of these studies demonstrate that the INFINITI System Assay for Factor II & Factor
V detects the target mutations in the specified sample size/level.
%CVs for calls present by site:
FV – WT / FII – WT FV – WT / FII - Homozygous
Site 1 52.5 – 55 21.7 – 24.6
Site 2 16.6 – 36.8 7.1 – 11.7
Site 3 19.0 – 37.7 7.9 – 27.2

Instrument:
One DNA sample (Factor II Wild, Factor C Wild) was analyzed using three different
INFINITI Analyzers and one lot of BioFilmChips, five times (five runs).
In addition, data on three instruments using a Standard Microarray Chip was
provided. Three instruments were tested on three different days. For each instrument
tested, each capture probe spot on the standard microchip was read 24 times, then
averaged, and a % CV calculated for that spot. The following lists the ranges for the
% CVs for the three instruments tested.
Reproducibility (Instrument)
Instrument S/N Date Average %CV % CV Range
013006 08-11-06 4.03% 1.9-7.5
032106 08-01-06 3.99% 2.7-6.5
080206 08-02-06 3.24% 1.9-5.3
Intra-instrument Reproducibility: The % CV using a single chip five times on a single
instrument ranged from 0.9% - 28.3%. Genotype calls were 100% reproduced within
each instrument.
Inter-instrument Reproducibility: Based on two-way ANOVA for the Factor II and
Factor V WT/MUT ratios, there was no significant different detected in 4 of the 5
runs (p < 0.01). The inter-instrument variability was determined as 0.5% - 12% CV.
All genotype calls were correct and reproducible.
An additional inter-instrument reproducibility study was performed with three
different instruments, three different chips, over three days using a heterozygous
sample for both FII and FV. All genotype calls were correct.

Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Positive or negative DNA assay controls are not included as part of the assay. The
manufacturer recommends that a positive sample (heterozygous for each mutation), a

negative sample, and a “No Template Control” be run with each assay.
Internal Controls: Five negative and three positive control spots are pre-immobilized
on each microarray chip. These are procedural hybridization controls. The negative
control is a 3’-biotynlated 24mer to which nothing should bind. The positive control
is a 3’-biotynlated 24mer that hybridizes the complementary Cy5 labeled oligomer
supplied in hybridization solution in the Intellipac Reagent Module. The negative
control spot values are also used in part of the algorithm calculations. Three
Registration (immobilized dyes) spots are also incorporated on each microarray and
used to ensure proper alignment/position during the optical reading process.
d. Detection limit:
The package insert recommends 25 ng/reaction. A serial dilution (300 – 0.005
ng/reaction) of a genomic sample demonstrated reproducible results down to 1
ng/reaction.
e. Analytical specificity:
Studies related to specificity were conducted during assay development. PCR primer
specificity was determined by amplicon size on a gel and sequencing the amplicon.
ASP primer specificity was determined by the correct calls made by the assay using
known genomic samples. Capture probe specificity was determined by hybridizing
different oligos and demonstrating that correct oligo hybridizes to the known spot.
Interference studies: Interference studies were conducted for bilirubin, cholesterol,
and heparin. One blood sample was divided into 7 test samples (300 µl each). Each
sample was spiked with cholesterol (70 and 7 mg/dl) bilirubin (8 and 0.8 mg/dl) and
heparin (1333 and 133 U/dl) and compared to an unspiked control sample. DNA was
extracted and each sample was tested three times. No interference was observed.
No studies were conducted with oral-anticoagulants, therefore, no claims were made.
f. Assay cut-off:
Ratio cut-off for a homozygous call requires that one analyte of the pair be at least 4x
the other. If the Wild Type signal is greater than the mutant signal, the call is Wild
Type. If the mutant signal is greater than the Wild Type signal, the call is
Homozygous Mutant. The Indeterminate zone is a ratio between 2 and 4. A ratio ≤ 2
is Heterozygous. A ratio ≥ 4 is Homozygous.
The algorithm for determining the genotype call and cut-off values were empirically
established using known samples and following certain criteria, adjusting for the
background, and taking into consideration the relative efficiencies of the PCR
amplification and variation in ASP for the different sequences.

--- Page 9 ---
The following describes the algorithm for determining the genotype call for the
INFINITI System Assay for Factor II & Factor V.
• First, qualify the signals:
o Average the three spots (RFU) for each Analyte and average the five spots
(RFU) for the Negative control.
o Subtract the average Negative signal from the average Analyte signal. If the
adjusted Analyte signal is less than 1.0, assign the nominal value 1.0.
o The adjusted analyte signal should be at least two times the negative signal for at
least one of the signals in the pair, otherwise, the call is “Indeterminate”.
• After signals are qualified, for Factor II, multiply the adjusted signals by the
“Multiplier” (2 for Wild and 0.75 for Mutant). Scaling using the “Multiplier” is done
to balance inequality of the reactions that result in signal generation. The Multiplier is
set such that in a heterozygous sample the signals of the Wild and Mutant forms are
equal.
For Factor V, the “Multiplier” is 1.0 (no scaling).
• To make the call, the ratio cutoffs are set such that a homozygous call requires that
one analyte of the pair to be at least 4x the other, and a heterozygous call requires that
one analyte of the pair to be at most 2x the other, i.e.,
o Determine the ratio of the high signal (Wild or Mutant) to the low signal (Wild or
Mutant).
o If the ratio is ≤ 2, the call is “Heterozygous”
o If the ratio is ≥ 4, the call is “Homozygous”.
(cid:190) If the Wild signal is greater than the Mutant signal, the call is “Homozygous
Wild”
(cid:190) If the Mutant signal is greater than the Wild signal, the call is “Homozygous
Mutant”
o If the ratio is between 2 and 4, the call is “Indeterminate”.
As described above, a call is made based on a qualified signal. Therefore, inaccurate
calls are rare. This demonstrates the robustness of the algorithm for making the calls.
An “indeterminate” call is made if any of the following occurs:
(a) The analyte does not have a qualified signal in the wild or mutant forms of the
analyte. To be qualified the adjusted signal (after subtracting the
negative/background signal) must be greater than 2x the negative/background
signal.
(b) The cut-off ratio [high signal (wild or mutant) to the low signal (wild or
mutant)] is between 2 and 4.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison (clinical) studies were conducted at three clinical sites. All three
sites compared the INFINITI System Assay for Factor II and Factor V to the 510(k)
cleared Roche Factor II and Factor V Kits. Subjects included in the comparison
studies were suspected thombophilic patients. In addition, identical sets of known
genomic samples were tested at each site, (five samples of known Factor II G20210A
mutation sample and five samples from a known Wild Type sample.
For Factor II, overall agreement between the two methods was 98.6% for a total of
208 samples. For Factor V, overall agreement between the two methods was 100%
for a total of 175 samples.

analysis. Each sample was assayed using the INFINITI System Assay for Factor II &
Factor V, and using the Roche ThermaCycler Factor II and Factor V Assays.
To test for the Factor II G20210A mutation, ten (10) known genomic DNA samples (5
Factor G20210A mutation samples and 5 Wild Type for Factor II G20210A mutation)
were added to the comparison study.

b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. This test is for use only with human peripheral whole blood collected
using EDTA as the anticoagulant.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The Factor V Leiden G1691A mutation is the most common mutation associated with
inherited thrombosis and results in resistance to activated protein C. It has a relatively
high prevalence in the general population (about 5% in Caucasians), and accounts for
85% to 95% of activated protein C resistant cases.
The G20210A mutation in the prothrombin (Factor II) gene is the second most common
mutation associated with hereditary thrombosis. It is associated with increased plasma
prothrombin levels and is present in 1% to 2% of the general population. Homozygote
carriers are very rare.
N. Instrument Name:
INFINITI Analyzer
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Simultaneous random and continuous access
2. Software:
13

--- Page 14 ---
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Operator-entered information as part of worklist sample ID
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
A unique identification, comprised of operator-entered information plus date and time, is
attached to each worklist sample ID in order to distinguish one run from another. Once
the worklist is submitted, all pipetting, sample identification, hybridization, incubation,
drying, scanning and result interpretation can be completed without manual intervention.
5. Calibration:
The INFINITI Analyzer does not require routine calibration. The normalizing factor for
the laser is calculated by the instrument using the Standard Microarray Chip. The
Standard Microarray Chip is a non-assay array used to calculate a multiplier used to
normalize all readings by the INFINITI Analyzer. The Standard Microarray Chip is for
use at AutoGenomics during instrument calibration and by AutoGenomics Customer
Service to check on instruments that are in the field.
The user does not have the capability to re-calibrate the instrument. Only AutoGenomics
Customer Service is authorized to perform this task. An error message is displayed when
the signal levels are off by > 20%.
6. Quality Control:
It is recommended that a positive sample (heterozygous and/or homozygous for both
genotypes), from a cell line or patient sample, for each mutation; a negative control (a
sample that does not contain the mutation of interest, i.e., a wild type sample); and a “No
Template Control” (Molecular Grade water) be included with each test run. The user
should contact AutoGenomics for recommendations.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
