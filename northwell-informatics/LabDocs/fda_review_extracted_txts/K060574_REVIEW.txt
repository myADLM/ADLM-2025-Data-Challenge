(kernicterus).

I. Device Description:
Total Bilirubin is an in vitro diagnostic assay for the quantitative determination of
total bilirubin in human serum or plasma of adults and neonates. Total (conjugated
and unconjugated) bilirubin couples with the diazo reagent in the presence of a
surfactant to form azobilirubin. The increase in absorbance at 548 nm due to
azobilirubin formation is directly proportional to the total bilirubin concentration. The
assay is supplied as a liquid, ready to use, two reagent kit. The calibrator materials
are sold separately and are prepared in bovine serum-based solution. The analyte
concentrations for the calibrators are adjusted using bilirubin extracts and synthetic
derivatives.

AEROSET System and the ARCHITECT c8000 System. Nine samples at
various concentrations spanning 0.054 to 27.967 mg/dL over two lots for the
AEROSET and 0.042 to 27.913 mg/dL over two lots for the ARCHITECT
c8000 were run in a minimum of four replicates. The percent recovery for
each sample was determined by dividing the mean observed result by the

ARCHITECT c8000 Lot 2: Observed = 0.999(Expected) – 0.00001; r =
0.9996
The reportable range of the assay is 0.1 – 25.0 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Internal reference standards are manufactured by gravimetric methods and are
traceable to NIST SRM 916a. The internal reference standards are used for
the determination of calibrator value assignments at each level. Calibration is
stable for 14 days (336 hours) for this assay.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) (the analytical concentration at which the
pooled analyte “within instrument” CV = 20%) was determined by measuring
20 spiked samples on 3 instruments for two lots for both the AEROSET
System and the ARCHITECT c8000 System. Concentrations ranged form
0.0767 to 0.0893 mg/dL over two lots for the AEROSET and 0.0795 to
0.0913 mg/dL over two lots for the ARCHITECT c8000. The data submitted
supports a LoQ of 0.1 mg/dL.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) (the lowest amount of analyte in a sample that
can be detected with 95% probability) was determined by measuring 20
samples on 3 instruments for two lots for both the AEROSET System and the
ARCHITECT c8000 System. The data submitted supports a LoD of 0.02
mg/dL. The sponsor will claim a higher LoD of 0.05 mg/dL in the labeling.
e. Analytical specificity:
Solutions of human serum albumin were spiked with bilirubin to create two
levels of bilirubin. The two solutions were spiked with various levels of
interferants. A minimum of seven replicates of each interferant level and
seven replicates of reference samples were run. The percent recovery was

b. Matrix comparison:
Ten subjects were used to compare total bilirubin results of a glass baseline
serum tube (with Bilirubin levels ranging from 0.257 to 0.895 mg/mL) to
plastic sodium heparin, lithium heparin with and without gel barrier, EDTA
and plastic tubes. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria were set at +/- 10% or +/-
0.2 mg/dL difference between the interferant result and the reference result,
whichever is greater, between the mean values of each sample for each tube
type in question and the plain glass serum tube. The data submitted
demonstrates an acceptable difference from the glass tube serum baseline on
both the AEROSET and the ARCHITECT c8000 Systems.
