antibody, and a monoclonal ACTH-specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium
complexa react to form a sandwich complex.
• 2nd incubation: After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the
complex becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and
streptavidin.
• The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the
microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode.
Unbound substances are then removed with ProCell. Application of a voltage
to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured
by a photomultiplier.
• Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument-specifically
generated by 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent
barcode.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range of the assay is 1.0-2000 pg/mL (0.220-440 pmol/L).
This range is defined by the lower detection limit and the maximum of the
master curve. Values below the detection limit are reported as < 1.0 pg/mL (<
0.220 pmol/L). Values above the measuring range are reported as > 2000
pg/mL (> 440 pmol/L).
The sponsor demonstrated linearity of the assay up to 1766.7 pg/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: This method has been standardized gravimetrically with
synthetic ACTH produced at Roche.
The CalSet, CalCheck and the PreciControl products are assayed and
compared to reference preparations and target values and ranges are assigned.
The values for ACTH are standardized against in-house reference standards
(synthetic ACTH in analyte-free human plasma matrix).
Study 1: Accelerated Stability
The Elecsys ACTH calibrators were stored at 35°C for 3 weeks, the reference
material at 4°C. At the end of three weeks, this on-test material was analyzed
in duplicate along with a reference material. The recovery was calculated as a
percent of the reference value.
Study 2: Reconstituted Stability at 20-25°C
The Elecsys ACTH calibrators were reconstituted and stored for 4 hours at 20-
25°C. The respective reference material was stored at 4°C. At the end of
storage time, the on-test material was analyzed in duplicate along with a
reference material. The recovery was calculated as a percent of the reference
value.
Study 3: Reconstituted Stability at -20°C:
The Elecsys ACTH calibrators were reconstituted and stored for 12 weeks at -
20°C. The respective reference material was stored at 4°C. At the end of
storage time, the on-test material was analyzed in duplicate along with a
reference material. The recovery was calculated as a percent of the reference
value.
The sponsor’s acceptance criterion was recovery of signal 90 – 110% of the
reference value.
ACTH CalCheck and PreciControl ACTH: followed the same study protocols
as above. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion was recovery of concentration
85 – 115% of the reference value.
d. Detection limit:
1.0 pg/mL (0.220 pmol/L)
6 of 9

--- Page 7 ---
The detection limit represents the lowest measurable analyte level that can be
distinguished from zero (limit of the blank). It is calculated as the value lying
two standard deviations above that of the lowest standard (master calibrator,
standard 1 + 2 SD, within-run precision, n = 21).
e. Analytical specificity:
The Elecsys ACTH two-site immunoassay measures intact ACTH 1-39. When
ACTH fragments or peptides were added to a patient’s plasma sample with
defined ACTH concentration, no interference was observed with ACTH 1-10,
ACTH 11-24, beta-MSH, and beta-Endorphin. Other ACTH fragments
(ACTH 1-17, ACTH 1-24, ACTH CLIP 18-39, ACTH 22-39, alpha-MSH 1-
13) > approx. 5000 pg/mL can bind to one of the antibodies and thereby
negatively interfere with the sandwich formation and lead to lower ACTH
values. See table below:
