L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay technique used for the
quantitative analysis of vancomycin in human serum or plasma. The assay is based on
competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the enzyme G6PDH
for antibody binding sites. Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody,
so the drug concentration in the sample can be measured in terms of enzyme activity.
Active enzyme converts oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to
NADH, resulting in an absorbance change that is measured spectrophotometrically.
Endogenous serum G6PDH does not interfere because the coenzyme functions only
with the bacterial (Leuconostoc mesenteroids) enzyme employed in the assay.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed a within run precision study using low, middle, and
high level vancomycin controls, and low and high human serum pools (HSP).
Each level was assayed twenty-one times. The concentrations used were:
Value
(µg/mL)
TDM Control I 6.0
TDM Control II 19.7
TDM Control III 37.3
Low HSP 15
High HSP 60
The sponsor’s acceptance criteria were:
For concentrations up to 10 µg/mL, standard deviation ≤ 0.9
For concentrations between 10 and 40µg/mL, CV ≤ 8%
For concentrations greater than 40µg/mL, CV ≤ 12%
All of these criteria were met for this study.
The sponsor also performed a second precision study based on CLSI
document EP5-T2, which addresses within-run, total, and between-day
precision. The samples used and the acceptance criteria were the same as with
the within-run precision study above.
Three replicate measurements of each sample were analyzed in one run per
day over 21 days. Four calibrations were performed during the course of the
study.

All of the sponsor’s acceptance criteria were met for the study based on CLSI
EP5-T2.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The measuring range of the assay is 1.7 – 80 μg/dL vancomycin.
To assess the linearity of the assay, an 11-level dilution series was prepared
using a vancomycin spiked human serum pool diluted with a nonspiked serum
pool.
For values above 10 µg/mL, the acceptance criterion is recovery within +/-
10% of the theoretical value.
The sponsor’s linearity claim extends to 80 µg/mL at the high end.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Preciset TDM I Calibrators are prepared to contain known quantities of
vancomycin in normal human serum and are traceable to USP reference
standards. The calibrators were cleared under k031856. The TDM Control Set
contains liquid controls based on human serum and are traceable to USP
reference standards. The controls were cleared under k060429.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit represents the lowest measurable analyte level that can be
distinguished from zero. It is calculated as the value lying two standard
deviations above that of the lowest standard (standard 1 + 2SD, within-run
precision, n = 21).
The calculated detection limit is 1.7 µg/mL (1.2 µmol/L).
e. Analytical specificity:
The specificity of the assay was calculated according to the following
formula:
If Da-Dt < LDL claim, then ND (Not Detectable)
If Da-Dt > LDL claim, then the cross-reactivity is calculated as follows:
% Cross-Reactivity = [(Da-Dt)/ C] x 100
Explanation of abbreviations:
LDL = Lower Detectable Limit
Dt = Concentration of Control Analyte Spike in serum
Da = Concentration of (Analyte + Cross-Reactant)
C = Concentration of Cross-Reactant
The materials used for cross reactivity testing included the following:

vancomycin test system and the mean value was used to determine the %
cross reactivity.
There was no cross reactivity for all compounds tested at the listed
concentrations.
The sponsor performed a separate drug interference study. Aliquots of a human
serum pool were spiked with Vancomycin at 30 µg/mL and then further spiked
with the drugs listed below. The sponsor states that all the drugs were spiked at a
concentration greater than the maximum allowed daily dose. The samples were
run in triplicate and the median value was compared to the target concentration of
30 µg/mL. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria for each drug was within ± 10% of
the targeted concentration of 30 µg/mL. All of the drugs tested met these criteria.

The sponsor also analyzed the effects of bilirubin, hemoglobin, lipemia (using
Intralipid), rheumatoid factor, and total protein on the assay. Vancomycin was
spiked into normal human serum at concentrations of 20 and 50 µg/mL for
bilirubin, hemoglobin, and lipemia. For rheumatoid factor and total protein
vancomycin was spiked in at 25 µg/mL only. Increasing amounts of bilirubin,
hemoglobin, Intralipid, rheumatoid factor, and total protein were added to the
spiked samples and analyzed in triplicate. The median value was chosen for

comparison for all the compounds except total protein where the mean was used.
The sponsor’s acceptance criterion was a recovery within ±10% of the targeted
concentrations of 20, 25 and 50 µg/mL. Although higher concentrations of the
interferents caused no interference, in their labeling the sponsor makes the
following claims:
No interference from:
Bilirubin (icterus) up to 30 mg/dL
Hemoglobin up to 650 mg/dL
Triglycerides (lipemia) up to 500 mg/dL
Rheumatoid Factor up to 100 IU/mL
Total Protein up to 12 g/dL
The sponsor included this statement in their labeling regarding human anti-mouse
antibodies (HAMA): As with any assay employing mouse antibodies, the
possibility exists for interference by human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) in the
sample, which could cause falsely lowered results.
For diagnostic purposes, the results should always be assessed in conjunction with
the patient’s medical history, clinical examination and other findings.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Fifty five non-pooled human samples were assayed in singlicate in 1 run vs.
the COBAS FP vancomycin reagent on the COBAS INTEGRA 700 analyzer.
The samples ranged in concentration from 5.0 to 67.2 µg/mL. The testing was
performed at Roche Diagnostics.
The sponsor’s acceptance criteria for the Passing-Bablok regression statistics
are a slope of 1.00 ± 0.10 (0.90-1.10), a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.95 or
greater, and a y-intercept of ± 0.27 µg/mL. The actual results obtained were a
slope of 1.038, a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.99, and a y-intercept of 0.094
µg/mL. The sponsor provided a regression plot of the method comparison.
