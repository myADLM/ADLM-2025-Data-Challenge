L. Test Principle:
Carbon dioxide is determined spectrophotometrically based on two coupled enzyme
reactions including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and malate
dehydrogenase (MDH). PEPC catalyzes the first reaction and produces oxaloacetate.
In the presence of MDH, the reduced cofactor is oxidized by oxaloacetate. This
results in a decrease in absorbance at 405 or 415 nm that is directly proportional to
carbon dioxide concentration in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision at normal and abnormal high levels was evaluated on the Cobas
Mira instrument according to CLSI EP5-A. In the study, two specimens
containing 25 mM and 40 mM CO were tested with two runs per day with
2
duplicates over 20 working days. The results are below.
Within Run Precision
25 mM CO 40 mM CO

Number of data points 80 80
Mean (mM) 24.1 40.1

The precision of the Diazyme Carbon Dioxide Enzymatic Assay was also
evaluated on the Cobas Mira instrument with samples in the abnormal low
range. In the study, twenty specimens containing approximately 16 mM CO
2
were tested in three separate runs over two days. The concentrations ranged
between 15.39 – 16.96 mM CO . The results are below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Two protocols were followed to demonstrate linearity. In Protocol A, six
levels of commercial Casco CO standard ranging from 0 to 50 mM were
2
tested in triplicate on the Cobas Mira automated analyzer. In Protocol B,
eleven levels of linearity set prepared by diluting a serum control containing
50 mM CO with saline (according to CLSI EP6-A) were tested. Protocol A
2
yielded recoveries ranging from approximately 99% to 105%. Protocol B
yielded recoveries ranging from approximately 90% to 106%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrator and controls are prepared by diluting sodium bicarbonate
solution with saline to the target value(s).
Value assignment of the calibrator on the Cobas Mira instrument consisted of
the following. The prepared lot of calibrator was tested in 10 runs on the
instrument using a commercially available assay and a primary CO reference
2
standard with traceability to NIST 351 and NIST 924 Carbonate Standards.
The mean value of the calibrator and %CV were calculated from replicate
analysis.
The same lot of calibrator was tested in 10 runs on the instrument using the
Diazyme Carbon Dioxide Enzyme Assay, the same primary CO reference
2
standard, and two patient serum samples previously tested with the
commercially available device. The mean value of the calibrator and the
%CV were calculated from replicate analysis.
Value assignment of the controls on the Cobas Mira instrument consisted of
the following. One lot of the Level 1 and Level 2 controls, along with the
primary CO reference standard and two patient serum samples previously
2
tested with a commercially available assay, were tested with 5 runs on the
Cobas Mira using one lot of the assay. The mean values and ranges of the
controls were calculated.
To assess reagent and calibrator stability, three lots of the assay kits with three
lots of calibrators after opening were tested. The results demonstrated that the
reagents and calibrators are stable for about 12 days at 37ºC and for at least 10
weeks at 25ºC. The shelf-life of the assay kit is at least 12 months at 2-8ºC.

The real time stability study is ongoing.
To assess open bottle stability of the controls, three lots of Diazyme Carbon
Dioxide Controls were tested. The results demonstrated that the reagents and
calibrators are stable for about 12 days at 37ºC and for at least 12 weeks at
25ºC. The shelf-life of the assay kit is at least 12 months at 2-8ºC. The real
time stability study is ongoing.
d. Detection limit:
To demonstrate limit of detection (LOD), a 1 mM CO sample was tested in
2
12 replicates on the Cobas Mira. The LOD, defined as the mean + 3SD, is
1.12 mM CO .
2
e. Analytical specificity:
To determine the level of interference from substances normally present in
serum, the device was tested with 25 mM and 40 mM CO serum samples
2
spiked with varying concentrations (according to CLSI EP7-A). Five levels
for each substance were tested in triplicate. Less than 10% deviation from 25
mM and 40 mM was observed when tested up to the concentrations below.
Interfering Substance Concentration
Triglyceride 1000 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid 5 mg/dL
Bilirubin 40 mg/dL
Bilirubin Conjugate 40 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 1000 mg/dL
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance of the Diazyme Carbon Dioxide Enzymatic Assay was compared
with performance of a commercially available assay on a Cobas Mira
analyzer. Sixty serum (consisting of pooled and individual patient samples)
and sixty individual patient plasma samples were analyzed. Some samples
were spiked with stock solution of CO to target concentrations, to ensure
2
distribution across the reportable range. Serum samples ranging from 5.9 to
44.5 mmol/L gave a correlation coefficient of 0.9859. Linear regression
analysis resulted in the following equation: y = 1.0447x – 0.9742. Plasma

samples ranging from 5.85 to 40.64 mmol/L gave a correlation coefficient of
0.9731. Linear regression analysis resulted in the following equation: y =

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The functionality of the device was evaluated at an independent outside
laboratory. In each run, a low control serum sample containing 25 mM
carbon dioxide and a high control serum sample containing 40 mM carbon
dioxide were analyzed on their Cobas Mira instrument. The results were as
follows:
Low Control Serum Sample High Control Serum Sample
25 24 24 40 40 39
Average = 24 Average = 40
4. Clinical cut-off:
