The ACCU-CHEK Aviva Test Strips are used with the ACCU-CHEK Aviva
meter. The ACCU-CHEK Aviva test system is designed to quantitatively
measure the concentration of glucose for monitoring glucose in the home or in

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Provides plasma equivalent results.
For over-the-counter use (capillary only) or professional use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
None; this is a complete blood glucose monitoring system (ACCU-CHEK Aviva
glucose monitoring system).
I. Device Description:
The ACCU-CHEK Aviva system utilizes reagent test strips stored within a desiccated
vial. A test strip is removed from the vial and inserted into the meter. Upon insertion,
the meter is activated. Blood is applied to the end of the test strip and a glucose result
is reported. The ACCU-CHEK Aviva system includes:
• ACCU-CHEK Aviva meter with battery
• ACCU-CHEK test strips and code key (may be sold separately)
• ACCU-CHEK Aviva control solutions (may be sold separately)
• ACCU-CHEK Multiclix lancet device (with blue cap for fingertip testing and a
clear cap for non-fingertip testing)
• ACCU-CHEK Multiclix lancets
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
ACCU-CHEK Aviva System
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
k043474 – introduction of Aviva system: expanded lower limit of linearity,
decreased sample volume compared to its predicate (k032552). Alternate site
testing in k043474 used k022127 as a predicate.
3. Comparison with predicate:
The device and the predicate are similar in the following ways: they have the
same intended use and test principle, the same reagent composition, use the same
blood volume, have the same operating principles, have the same reportable
range, and the same reagent stability.
The reviewed device differs in the allowed samples types (this submission adds
arterial, neonatal capillary, and neonatal cord blood) and extends the hematocrit
range of the meter to 10 – 70%.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The ACCU-CHEK Aviva System utilizes Glucose dehydrogenase technology. The
enzyme glucose dehydrogenase converts the glucose in a blood sample to
gluconolactone. This reaction liberates an electron that reacts with a coenzyme
electron acceptor, the oxidized form of the mediator hexacyanoferrate (III), forming
the reduced form of the mediator hexacyanoferrate (III). The test strip employs the
2

--- Page 3 ---
electrochemical principle of biamperometry. The meter applies a voltage between two
identical electrodes, which causes the reduced mediator formed during the incubation
period to be reconverted to an oxidized mediator. This generates a small current that
is read by the meter and reported as the glucose result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Established in k043474.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Studies were performed in k043474; the assay range is 10 – 600 mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls were cleared under k043474.
d. Detection limit:
Established in k043474.
e. Analytical specificity:
A study was performed to determine if the lower limit of the hematocrit range
could be extended from 20% to 10%. ACCU-CHEK Aviva meter results
from spiked low (~40 mg/dL), normal (~120 mg/dL), and high (~450 mg/dL)
blood samples adjusted to a hematocrit of 10% were compared to results for
low, normal, and high spiked samples with a hematocrit of 43%. Three strip
lots were tested 16 times each for a total of 48 replicates per condition. Bias
compared to the normative hematocrit was within acceptable limits.
Other analytical specificity parameters were established in k043474. The
following will be claimed as limitations for potential interference:
• Galactose
• Lipidemia (Triglycerides)
• Maltose
• Xylose (Xylose was not be tested in whole blood but will be listed as a
limitation based on serum results.)
These compounds, in excess of the concentrations below, may produce
elevated results:
- Galactose: >10 mg/dL can give falsely elevated test results.
- Maltose: >13 mg/dL intravenously can give falsely elevated test results.
- Lipids (Triglycerides) : >4800 mg/dL can give falsely elevated test results
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Capillary fingerstick (i.e. consumer testing) testing, venous, and alternate site
testing claims were established in k043474.
b. Matrix comparison:
Arterial samples: One hundred ninety-seven (197) random arterial samples
from 2 hospital sites were collected and tested on three different strip lots with
the ACCU-CHEK Aviva meter and compared to a reference laboratory
glucose hexokinase method (tested in duplicate) converted to a plasma
equivalent value. Samples ranged from 37 – 489 mg/dL; hematocrits ranged
from approximately 10 – 51%. Mean bias (units = mg/dL at glucose
concentrations < 75mg/dL % at glucose concentrations ≥75 mg/d), the
percentage of results that fall outside of the sponsor’s acceptance criteria (the
percentage of individual results falling outside 15 mg/dL of the reference
result at glucose concentrations < 75mg/dL and outside 20% of the reference
at glucose concentrations ≥75 mg/dL will not be significantly higher than
5%), and regression analysis were calculated for each lot:
ACCU-CHEK Aviva Arterial Glucose Sample Performance
Lot # Regression Correlation Mean Bias % Outliers
1 y = 0.983 – 0.2 0.983 -2 1
2 y = 0.998 + 0.4 0.983 0 2
3 y = 0.990 + 4.3 0.981 2.2 2.5
Neonate capillary samples: Ninety-six (96) capillary heelstick samples were
collected from one clinical site; all samples were from subjects less than 31
days old. Each sample was tested on three different strip lots with the ACCU-
CHEK Aviva meter and compared to a reference laboratory glucose
hexokinase method (tested in duplicate) converted to a plasma equivalent
value. Samples ranged from 13 – 432 mg/dL; hematocrits ranged from 27 –
67%. Approximately one-third of the samples had glucose values less than 50
mg/dL; four samples were above 150 mg/dL. Mean bias (units = mg/dL at
glucose concentrations < 75mg/dL % at glucose concentrations ≥75 mg/d), the
percentage of results that fall outside of the sponsor’s acceptance criteria (the
percentage of individual results falling outside 15 mg/dL of the reference
result at glucose concentrations < 75mg/dL and outside 20% of the reference
at glucose concentrations ≥75 mg/dL will not be significantly higher than
5%), and regression analysis were calculated for each lot:
ACCU-CHEK Aviva Neonatal Glucose Sample Performance
Lot # Regression Correlation Mean Bias % Outliers
1 y = 0.960 + 3.1 0.987 -0.9 4.2
2 y = 0.977 + 2.8 0.986 -1.1 5.2
3 y = 0.959 + 5.9 0.984 1.6 5.2

Since the neonatal clinical samples did not cover the claimed meter range,
results from a study of accuracy of spiked samples with extremely high
glucose concentrations and varying hematocrits were provided by the sponsor
to demonstrate acceptable performance (≤ 20 % bias from laboratory
reference) at the upper end of the claimed range. These laboratory results were
not incorporated into the clinical study data presented above or in the labeling.

a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The normal fasting blood glucose range for an adult without diabetes as related to
plasma is 74-106 mg/dL1. Two hours after meals, blood glucose range for a non-
diabetic is less than 140 mg/dL2. For people with diabetes please consult your
diabetes team for the blood glucose range appropriate for you.
