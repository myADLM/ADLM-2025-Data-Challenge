SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
OIVD Review Memorandum (Decision Making Document is Attached)
To: THE FILE RE: DOCUMENT NUMBER k060627
________________________________________________________________
Tag-It™ Cystic Fibrosis Kit, Tm Bioscience Corporation
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the submitter’s
own Class II device requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:
1. The name and 510(k) number of the submitter’s previously cleared device.
Tag-It™ Cystic Fibrosis Kit, Tm Bioscience Corporation (k043011).
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as
described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which
includes instructions for use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or
promotional materials (labeling changes are permitted as long as they do not affect the
intended use).
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including clearly labeled diagrams,
engineering drawings, photographs, user’s and/or service manuals in sufficient detail to
demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified
device has not changed.
The modifications were: a) annealing temperature adjustment for the ASPE multiplex
reaction, b) additional recommended supplier of the ancillary reagent Shrimp Alkaline
Phosphatase (SAP), and c) software update to the Version 1.01.
4. Comparison Information (similarities and differences) to the applicant’s legally marketed
predicate device include labeling, intended use, sample volume and type, scientific and
method principle, instrumentation and method comparison.
5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the
modification on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis. The
risk analysis method used to assess the impact of the device modification was the
Fault Tree Analysis (page 2 of 14 of the 5/26/06 response).
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation
activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be
applied (page 12 of 14 of the 5/26/06 response, also summarized in Table 1A, page 5
of 14, and 1B, page 8 of 14).
c) A summary of changes to the PI cleared in K043011 (page 14 of 14 of the 5/26/06
response) was provided, as well as the cleared and modified PI, with highlighted
changes.
d) A declaration of conformity with design controls. The declaration of conformity should
include:
i) A statement signed by the individual responsible, that, as required by the risk
analysis, all verification and validation activities were performed by the designated
individual(s) and the results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance
criteria were met (Tab 11 of 3/16/06 original document), and
ii) A statement signed by the individual responsible, that the manufacturing facility is
in conformance with design control procedure requirements as specified in 21
1

--- Page 2 ---
CFR 820.30 and the records are available for review (Tab 11 of 3/16/06 original
document).
6. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary, and the Indications for Use
Enclosure.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the
indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the
submitter’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information
between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific
technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as
specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be
determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
