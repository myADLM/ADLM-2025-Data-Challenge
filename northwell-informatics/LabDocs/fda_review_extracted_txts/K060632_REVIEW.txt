L. Test Principle:
The VITROS NT-proBNP assay is performed using the VITROS Immunodiagnostic
Products NT-proBNP Reagent Pack and VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products NT-
proBNP Calibrators on the VITROS Immunodiagnostic System. An immunometric
technique is used. NT-proBNP present in the specimen reacts simultaneously with a
biotinylated antibody and a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled conjugate. The
antigen-antibody complex is captured by streptavidin on the wells. Unbound
materials are removed by washing. A reagent containing luminogenic substrates (a
luminol derivative and peracid salt) and an electron transfer agent (a substituted
acetanilide) is added to the wells. The HRP in the bound conjugate catalyzes the
oxidation of the luminol derivative, producing light. The electron transfer agent
increases the level and duration of the light produced. The light signals are read by
the VITROS Immunodiagnostic System. The amount of HRP conjugate bound is
directly proportional to the concentration of NT-proBNP present in the specimen.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated according to CLSI protocol EP5. Two replicates of
each of 3 frozen control sera and 4 frozen human sample pools were assayed
on 2 separate occasions per day on at least 20 different days. The experiment
was performed using 3 reagent lots on three different VITROS
Immunodiagnostic Systems.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
6

--- Page 7 ---
The claimed measuring range of the assay is 5 – 35,000 pg/mL.
A linearity study was conducted using 10 pooled samples with values ranging
from 3.97 to 30,727 pg/mL. The mean measured concentrations of pools 2 to
10, when expressed as a percentage of the calculated concentrations, gave a
mean result of 99.2%, with a range of 95.1% to 105%. Analysis by linear
regression also indicated that the assay is linear across the range tested (3.97
to 30,727 pg/mL) with the following regression equation: y = 0.9687x -
15.011, R = 0.9999. An additional linearity study was conducted to assess the
linearity of the assay up to 35,000 pg/mL, which is the upper limit of the
reportable range of the assay. In this study, the samples ranged from 2.29 to
44, 653 pg/mL. The mean measured concentrations of pools 2 to 10, when
expressed as a percentage of the calculated concentrations, gave a mean result
of 98.3%, with a range of 97.6% to 99.7%.
To assess the potential for high dose hook effect, a series of samples having
NT-proBNP concentrations ranging from 8100 to 514,667 pg/mL were
assayed in the VITROS NT-proBNP assay. Singleton determinations of each
sample were made with each of 3 Master Lots. No high dose hook effect was
observed in the VITROS NT-proBNP assay in samples containing up to
500,000 pg/mL NT-proBNP.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Both the Calibrators and Range Verifiers are value assigned by performing
multiple determinations using several VITROS Immunodiagnostic Systems.
The values for the calibrators are assigned by performing multiple
determination of each calibrator. The calibrators are traceable to reference
calibrators, which have been value assigned to correlate with the Roche
Elecsys proBNP immunoassay. VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products NT-
proBNP Range Verifiers and VITROS NT-proBNP Calibrators are supplied
ready for use and are stored at 2-8 °C until the expiration date. Stability
studies are ongoing.
To establish the open-vial stability of the VITROS NT-proBNP Range
Verifiers, the verifiers were pooled and stored in sample cups at 2-8°C and -
20°C. The pooled VITROS NT-proBNP Range Verifiers were tested at the
initial time point (day 0) and days 4 (interim), 7 (expiry) and 10 (post expiry)
of the trial using three Master Kit Lots and three lots of VITROS NT-proBNP
Range Verifiers. All data for stored 2-8°C Range Verifiers and fresh Range
Verifiers, returned results within acceptance limits up to and including the day
10 time-point, therefore, supporting the storage claim of 7 days at 2-8°C.
To establish the open-vial stability of the VITROS NT-proBNP Calibrators,
the calibrators were opened, pooled and stored in sample cups at 2-8°C. The
pooled calibrators were tested at the initial timepoint. The calibrators stored at
2-8°C were tested at weeks 0, 4, 8 and 10. The stored calibrators were
7

--- Page 8 ---
compared against fresh calibrators using 3 Master Lots. The data obtained
demonstrates no differences between the fresh and stored calibrators. The data
supports the storage of the calibrators at 2-8°C after opening for up to 8
weeks.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) for NT-proBNP is 4.29 pg/mL, determined using
methods consistent with the CLSI guideline EP17-A, with proportions of false
positives (α) less than 1% and false negatives (β) less than 1%. This
determination was based on 1049 determinations, with 150 blank and 899 low-
level samples. The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined to be 1.71 pg/mL. The
limit of quantitation (LoQ) was set at 5.00 pg/mL to ensure acceptable precision
within the lower range of the assay.
Analytical Sensitivity = < 5.00 pg/mL
LoB = 1.71 pg/mL, LoD = 4.29 pg/mL and LoQ = 5.00 pg/mL
Functional sensitivity = 10.0 pg/mL (The sponsor has defined function
sensitivity as the concentration at which the assay achieves 20% CV.)
e. Analytical specificity:
Specificity of the VITROS NT-proBNP assay was evaluated by testing the
following substances as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) document EP7.They were found not to interfere
(bias <10%) with the assay at a NT-proBNP concentration of approximately
125 pg/mL.

f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cutoffs are 125 pg/mL for patients younger than 75 years and 450
pg/mL for patients 75 years and older.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Accuracy was evaluated based on CLSI Protocol EP9.The plots show the
results of a method comparison study using patient samples analyzed on the
VITROS System with those analyzed using the Roche Elecsys proBNP assay.
The relationship between the two methods was determined by Deming’s
regression.
b. Matrix comparison:
Individual results from three determinations of each sample type (serum,
EDTA plasma, and heparin plasma) and after storage at 2-8º C and after 1, 2
and 3 freeze/thaw cycles were tabulated. The mean value for each specimen
type within each storage condition was calculated from the three
determinations. The overall mean, SD and CV (%) for each sample type
across storage conditions were also calculated. For each condition (sample
type or storage), % differences were calculated from the baseline (serum for
specimen type and fresh for storage condition). The mean and range of the %
differences, across all samples, for each condition were calculated. The results
indicated that all sample types are suitable (< 10% mean percent difference)
for use in the VITROS NT-proBNP assay and that their suitability is not

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Three peer reviewed literature references were provided demonstrating
clinical support of the additional indications for use as an aid in the
assessment of increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality in patients
at risk for heart failure who have stable coronary artery disease. All three
studies measured NT-proBNP using the Elecsys proBNP Immunoassay, to
which the VITROS NT-proBNP assay is traceable. The VITROS NT-proBNP
assay uses the same antibody as the Roche Elecsys assay. In the VITROS
NT-proBNP assay, the calibrators are traceable to reference calibrators, which
have been value assigned to correlate with the Roche Elecsys proBNP
immunoassay. The Elecsys and VITROS assays have the same analytical
range, 5-35,000 pg/mL. The method comparison between the Elecsys and
VITROS assays shows that the two assays compare with the following
regression equation: VITROS NT-proBNP (y) = 0.9839(x) Roche Elecsys
proBNP + 19.7 pg/mL. The studies are:

4. Clinical cut-off:
Recommended clinical thresholds are 125 pg/mL for patients younger than 75
years and 450 pg/mL for patients 75 years and older. The Receiver Operator
Curve (ROC) compares clinical sensitivity and specificity at various decision
thresholds. The optimum decision threshold maximizes the area under the curve
(AUC) and represents the highest sensitivity and specificity for the assay. The
ROC analysis for the VITROS NT-proBNP assay is presented below. The AUC
for the VITROS NT-proBNP assay is 0.950 with a 95% Confidence Interval of
0.931 to 0.968.
5. Expected values/Reference range:

The circulating NT-proBNP concentration was determined from 242 individuals
without CHF (95 men and 147 women). This population included apparently
healthy individuals and individuals with diabetes, hypertension, pulmonary
disease, and mild renal insufficiency. The descriptive statistics for NT-proBNP
concentrations in the reference cohort are shown in the following tables.
Blood samples were obtained from 242 patients diagnosed with CHF (135 men
and 107 women). The descriptive statistics for NT-proBNP concentrations in
patients with CHF and NYHA Classifications I – IV are presented in the tables
below.
