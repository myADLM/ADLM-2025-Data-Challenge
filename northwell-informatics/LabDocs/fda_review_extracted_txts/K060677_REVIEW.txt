assay so that the result can be expressed as a relative ratio, i.e., %CDT of the total
transferrin. The calculation of %CDT can be used as a tool to identify possible
chronic heavy alcohol consumption.”
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Indicated for prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
BN II and BN ProSpec System
I. Device Description:
The N Latex CDT Kit consists of reagents, standards, and controls. There are three
reagents: Reagent 1 contains a suspension of polystyrene particles coated with CDT,
Reagent 2 contains a suspension of polystyrene particles coated with anti-CDT mouse
monoclonal antibodies, while the Supplementary Reagent is a buffered saline
solution. Standards and controls contain stabilized human serum matrix and known
concentrations of CDT.
Note: This assay and the N Antiserum to Human Transferrin Assay must be used in
conjunction to calculate %CDT. CDT values obtained from this assay and
transferrin values obtained from the transferrin assay are used to calculate %CDT by
onboard software. Transferrin assay components were not evaluated in this
submission (see k972840).
All human source materials were tested for HBsAg, HCV, and HIV-1/2 and found to
be negative.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Axis-Shield %CDT
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
k992502
3. Comparison with predicate:
The devices have a similar intended use, consist of assay reagents, calibrators, and
controls, and are based on immunoassays that use mouse monoclonal antibodies.
Both assays report %CDT (mg/mL CDT divided by mg/mL total transferrin).
The assays differ in technology, preparation technique and unit of measure. The
predicate method utilizes an ion-exchange column to separate CDT isoforms from
other transferrin molecules. The CDT content in the eluted fraction is then
determined by a turbidimetric immunoassay. The N Latex CDT assay does not
have a separation step but relies on the ratio of the results of two separate assays
to calculate %CDT. The measuring ranges of the assays differ.

L. Test Principle:
This is a competitive immunoassay; CDT in the sample competes with CDT-coated
polystyrene particles for a limited number of mouse monoclonal anti-CDT binding
sites on polystyrene particles. CDT in the sample inhibits the aggregation of the
polystyrene beads resulting in lower turbidity and therefore less scattered light. The
ratio of scattered light to directed light is compared to a known standard to calculate
the concentration of CDT.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Imprecision was determined by measuring two controls and two serum pools
(one low, one high) eight times a day over five days (n = 40) using a BN II
system. Imprecision results were within the acceptance criteria set by the
sponsor.

% CDT % CV % CV % CV
Control Level 1 2.2 4.2 1.6 4.2
Control Level 2 5.7 2.8 1.5 3.0
Serum Pool – Low 1.8 4.9 7.6 8.9
Serum Pool – High 8.7 3.5 2.4 4.0
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity of the N Latex CDT Kit was evaluated by serially diluting a known
sample with high concentrations of CDT and transferrin with N Diluent. Each
dilution was tested five times on a BN ProSpec System and the mean %
recovery was calculated.
Recovery of samples relative to the target value ranged from 94% to 121%
(mean recovery 102%) for %CDT and 98% to 120% for mg/L CDT (mean
recovery 104%). Recovery was within the sponsor’s acceptance
specifications.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The standards and controls are calibrated against an internal
master calibrator that is in turn calibrated against CRM 470, a reference
standard for transferrin. The master calibrator value is corrected for the

difference in masses between the carbohydrate portions of CDT and normal
transferrin.
Stability: Unopened assay components were shown to be stable for 12 month
at +2 to +8 °C by real-time testing. Opened, all components are stable for two
weeks stored at +2 to +8 °C. On-board stability for all components is a
minimum of three days.
d. Detection limit:
Twenty replicates of the N-Diluent were run on a BN ProSpec. The analytical
sensitivity of the N Latex CDT assay was defined as the mean value plus two
standard deviations. The resulting value, 0.003 g/L was within the sponsor’s
acceptance criterion.
e. Analytical specificity:
Normal serum samples were spiked with the compounds below at various
concentrations and the concentration of CDT was compared to that of an
unspiked sample as determined on a BN II System. The sponsor reports no
interference (defined by the sponsor’s acceptance criterion as less than ± 20%
of the unspiked sample) up to the concentrations listed in the table below:

f. Assay cut-off:

concentrations in normal subjects.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Serum samples (n = 116) were evaluated with the N Latex CDT Assay and the
predicate Axis-Shield %CDT assay on a BN II System. The majority (n =
101) of the samples were collected from patients undergoing routine CDT
testing; the balance were spiked samples. These patients were suspected of
having heavy alcohol consumption but other clinical details were not
available. Sample concentrations ranged from 1.1 to 32.0 %CDT. Regression
analysis of the results yielded the following equation: y = 0.720x + 0.75 %
CDT, r = 0.99.
