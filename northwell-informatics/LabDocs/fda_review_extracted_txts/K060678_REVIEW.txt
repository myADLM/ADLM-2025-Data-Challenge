I. Device Description:
The device uses a competitive immunoassay, where the formation of a signal generating
immunoassay complex is inhibited by Anti-HAV antibody (AB) from the tested sample. The
system is comprised of three main elements: (i) VITROS Anti-HAV Total Reagent Pack, with the
VITROS Anti-HAV Total Calibrator and the VITROS Anti-HAV Total Controls, (ii) VITROS
Immunodiagnostic System – instrumentation, which provides automated use of the immunoassay
kits, and (iii) common reagents used by the VITROS System.
The VITROS Anti-HAV Total Reagent Pack is composed of streptavidin coated wells, HAV
antigen in a buffered matrix of BSA and mouse serum with antimicrobial agent, and mouse anti-
HAV monoclonal antibody conjugated to biotin and the same mouse anti-HAV monoclonal
antibody conjugated to horse radish peroxidase. The VITROS Anti-HAV Total Calibrator is a
combination of anti-HAV negative and anti-HAV total positive plasma from donors confirmed
negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV 1+2) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). The VITROS Anti-HAV Total Controls are a negative
control (normal human plasma obtained from HBsAg, HIV 1+2 and HCV negative donors), and a
positive control (normal human plasma spiked with anti-HAV Total positive plasma, both from
HBsAg, HIV 1+2 and HCV negative donors).

Immunoassay complex with negative sample (no Anti-HAV AB present in sample):
Immunoassay complex with positive sample (Anti-HAV AB present in sample):
The competitive assay technique uses a pre-incubation of sample (potentially containing anti-HAV
AB) with HAV antigen in the assay reagent followed by incubation with a biotinylated mouse
monoclonal anti-HAV AB and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled mouse monoclonal anti-
HAV AB. The immune complex of biotinylated mouse Anti-HAV AB – HAV antigen – HPR-
labeled mouse anti-HAV AB is captured by streptavidin on the wells, unbound materials are
removed by washing. The bound HRP conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. The light
signals are read by the VITROS System. The amount of HRP conjugate bound is inversely
proportional to the concentration of anti-HAV AB present. The assay used two controls:
negative, anti-HAV negative normal human plasma and positive, normal human plasma spiked
with anti-HAV AB total positive plasma.
Assay Type Assay Time and Temperature
Incubation time: 45 minutes
Competitive Time to first result: 53 minutes
Temperature: 37° C
Interpretation of the results:
Results are calculated as a normalized signal, relative to a cut-off value (signal/cutoff, s/c). During
the calibration process a lot-specific parameter, encoded on the lot calibration card, is used to
determine a valid stored cut-off value for the VITROS Immunodiagnostic System. Results are
automatically calculated by the VITROS Immunodiagnostic System.

*The 2/3 rule is applied, if 2/3 tests are borderline again, analysis of follow-up sample (collected
within 2-4 weeks) is recommended.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated based on the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly
NCCLS) protocol EP5-A2. The precision panel consisting of 4 samples (a negative, a
negative close to the cut-off, a positive close to the cut-off and a positive) was prepared and
shipped to 3 different sites. Two replicates of each of 4 panel samples were assayed at
each of the 3 different sites once per day for at least 20 different days, over one calibration
interval. The experiment was performed using 1 reagent lot on three different VITROS
Immunodiagnostic Systems at three different sites. The data presented is a summary of the
product performance by site:

Calibration is lot specific; reagent packs and calibrators are linked by lot number. A
Master Calibration is established for each new reagent lot by performing multiple assays.
This is the process by which a lot-specific parameter [a] which links the cut-off value to the
calibrator signal is determined.
Cut-off value = (a x Signal of CAL1)
The lot-specific parameter, the expected calibrator signal and the data which enables a
System to calculate the cut-off value, are encoded on the lot calibration card. Scanning the
lot calibration card loads the encoded data onto the System. When the calibrator is
processed the validity of the calibration is assessed against a quality parameter which
compares the actual signal of the calibrator with the expected signal. If the calibration is

acceptable the cut-off value is calculated and stored for use with any reagent pack of that
lot. The quality of calibration cannot be completely described by a single parameter. The
calibration report should be used in conjunction with control values to determine the
validity of the calibration. Recalibration is required after a predetermined calibration
interval, or when a different reagent lot is loaded.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) for anti- HAV Total is 2.024, determined consistent with the
guidelines in CLSI EP 17-A and with proportions of false positives (α) less than 5% and
false negatives (β) less than 5%; based on 136 determinations each, with 1 blank and 3
low-level samples.
The limit of blank (LoB) is 2.097, determined consistent with the guidelines in CLSI EP
17-A and with proportions of false positives (α) less than 5% and false negatives (β) less
than 5%; based on 136 determinations of a sample free of anti-HAV.
e. Analytical specificity:
The specificity of the VITROS Anti-HAV Total assay was evaluated by testing 283
samples from the following potentially cross-reacting sub-groups: SLE, anti-HIV,
Cirrhosis, Non-viral Liver Disease, anti-HCV, anti-CMV, anti-HSV I & II, anti-EBV, anti-
syphilis, anti-Rubella, anti-Toxoplasma, anti-HBs, anti-HTLV, HBsAg, Rheumatoid
Factor, Pregnancy (1st, 2nd, 3rd trimester), HAMA, Rubeola, Rubella, Mumps, VZV and
ANA. All initially reactive samples were tested with a reference assay for confirmation.
Of the 283 samples tested, four (4) were observed to be discordant. The incidence of
discordant samples is not significantly different from the claimed sensitivity and
specificity.

Substances that do not interfere:
Serial dilutions were made for bilirubin, triolein, hemoglobin and biotin, and point estimates
were made for sodium azide and dipyrone. The mean result of 3 determinations of a solution
of each test substance was compared with that of a control pool, for both a negative and
positive sample. For each substance, the highest concentration which was considered not to
impact results, the mean result from the three kit lots and the classification for both positive
and negative samples is shown in the table below:

f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off signal was established at light signal that gave the best discrimination between
anti-HAV reactive and anti-HAV negative sample populations, to provide optimum
specificity and sensitivity for the assay. The cut-off signal level was assigned a result of
1.00. Assay results < 0.80 indicate a reactive sample, positive for anti-HAV. A result of
≥0.8 and <1.0 indicates a borderline sample. A result of ≥1.0 and <4.0 indicates a non
reactive sample, negative for anti-HAV. A result of ≥4.0 indicates a sample which requires
dilution and re-testing

b. Matrix comparison:
Serum vs. plasma (heparin, EDTA, or citrate)
A total of 25 donors had blood drawn which was spiked with anti-HAV Total positive
plasma to a level close to the assay cut-off. The spiked blood was then aliquoted into
serum and plasma collection tubes and tested in the VITROS anti-HAV Total assay. The
percent difference in the plasma from serum was calculated. Mean percent differences from
serum are represented below for each plasma type tested. The differences between serum
and citrate samples may be larger than 10% due to the liquid anticoagulant in the tube.
There is approximately a 10% dilution of the blood by the liquid anticoagulant in the citrate

Methods comparison with predicate device:
The performance characteristics of the VITROS Anti- HAV Total assay were established in
a multi-center prospective among individuals with signs or symptoms or biochemical
manifestations (elevated liver function tests) of hepatitis and those at high risk of hepatitis
infection due to lifestyle, behavior, occupation, or known exposure events. Specimens
were evaluated from 872 subjects prospectively enrolled at three geographically separated
collection sites within the United States (Population 1) located in Miami, FL (12.6%),
Dallas, TX (37.5%) and Chicago, IL (49.9%). Specimens were also evaluated from 313
subjects with signs and symptoms of viral hepatitis prospectively enrolled in an area in
India with a high prevalence of viral hepatitis (Population 2). The subjects in Population 1
were Caucasian (25.6%), African American (53.1%), Hispanic (17.0%), with the remaining
4.3% represented by other ethnic groups. The group was 57.3% male and 42.7% female,
and ranged in age from 16 to 81 years. Testing of these specimens with the VITROS Anti -
HAV Total assay occurred at diagnostic laboratories located in Miami, FL (12.6%), Port
Jefferson, NY (49.9%) and Minneapolis, MN (37.5%). The subjects in Population 2 were

Performance of the VITROS Anti-HAV Total Assay in Known Anti-HAV IgM Reactive
Subjects:
The performance of the VITROS Anti-HAV Total assay was evaluated among serum
samples from subjects known to be anti-HAV IgM positive. A total of 77 samples
collected in Egypt (N=50) and India (N=27) from subjects with a medical history and
laboratory results indicative of acute hepatitis A were tested concurrently with the VITROS
and reference anti-HAV IgM and anti-HAV total assays. The VITROS Anti-HAV Total
assay was reactive in 100% of the 77 anti-HAV IgM reactive samples. The positive
percent agreement of the VITROS Anti-HAV Total assay with anti-HAV IgM reactive
status and the 95% exact confidence interval are presented in the following table:

Anti-HAV Total assay was considered falsely reactive for purposes of the analysis.
Performance of the VITROS Anti-HAV Total Assay in Pediatric Subjects:
The VITROS Anti-HAV Total assay was also evaluated using residual laboratory serum
samples from pediatric subjects at low risk for viral hepatitis. The samples were unlinked
to the subjects’ identities, and were included based on age, gender and available volume
remaining after all testing ordered for that sample had been completed. Samples were
selected such that the following age ranges (in years) were represented (2-4, 5-9, 10-14,
and 15-19). The positive and negative percent agreement of the VITROS Anti-HAV Total
assay with the reference anti-HAV total assay, and the 95% exact confidence intervals are
presented in the following table. One sample, negative with the reference assay, was

Seroconversion Study:
Three seroconversion panels each having at least 5 individual samples with a known
predetermined result were measured in the VITROS Anti-HAV Total assay and in a
reference assay. The results were compared with the published results for the reference
assay. The VITROS Anti-HAV Total assay gave seroconversion sensitivity equivalent to a

Cord blood samples:
A total of 20 cord blood (as a surrogate for neonate serum) and 10 adult serum samples
were tested in the VITROS Anti-HAV Total assay. None of the samples gave a reactive
result in the VITROS Anti-HAV Total Assay. Forty-five (45) μl of anti-HAV positive
material was added to 255 μl of cord blood and adult serum. A negative bias* was
observed in the cord blood results when compared to the adult serum.
