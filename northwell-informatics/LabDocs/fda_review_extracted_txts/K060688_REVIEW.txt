Test Principle same
When sample testing is
initiated, sample , APTT
reagent, a negatively
charged contact activator
and buffer are incubated
at 37ºC for a specific
period of time which
initiates the activation of
the intrinsic coagulation
pathway. Calcium is
them added to trigger the
coagulation process and
the time required for clot
formation is measured.
