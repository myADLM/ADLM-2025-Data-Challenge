K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff; Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family
Policy
L. Test Principle:
The assay uses a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay technique based on competition
between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for antibody binding sites. Active enzyme converts
oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH, resulting in an
absorbance change that is measured spectrophotometrically. Enzyme activity
decreases upon binding to the antibody, so the drug concentration in the sample can
be measured in terms of enzyme activity.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-lab precision was evaluated at the manufacturer’s site on the Hitachi
911 and 917 analyzers. One run consisting of triplicates of each sample was
performed each day over 21 days. The evaluation was performed by one
operator using one lot of reagents and controls. Control material and spiked
human serum pools were evaluated. Calculations were performed according
to CLSI EP-5A, appendix C. Results are shown below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linear range is 2.8 - 150.0 µg/mL. To determine the linearity of the assay,
an evenly distributed dilution series was prepared using a valproic acid spiked
human serum pool diluted with a non-spiked serum pool. Recoveries shown
below represent the observed result (median value, n=3) divided by the
expected result X 100%. The expected result is the starting concentration
multiplied by the dilution factor.

Dilution of high samples:
The package insert instructs customers to manually dilute (1:1) samples with
Preciset TDM I Diluent when results exceed the reportable range. Validation
of this procedure resulted in percent differences between expected and
observed values within +/-3%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators were cleared under k031856. Controls were cleared under
k060429.
d. Detection limit:
The manufacturer defines the detection limit as the mean plus 2 standard
deviations of the 0 calibrator. For this evaluation, the assay was calibrated as
in the normal procedure. The 0 Calibrator was measured in 21 replicates and
Calibrator B in 5 replicates in a single run and absorbance values were
recorded. Results support the detection limit of 2.8 ug/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The assay was evaluated on the Hitachi 917 for interference from drugs, and
endogenous compounds.
Cross-reactivity:
The following compounds were tested for cross-reactivity in serum samples
containing approximately 60 ug/mL valproic acid. Results were compared to
those of control samples without cross-reactant.
