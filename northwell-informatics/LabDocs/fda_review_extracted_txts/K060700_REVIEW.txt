L. Test Principle:
Diluted calibrators, controls, and diluted patient samples are added to microwell
coated with either PR3 or MPO antigen. Anti-PR3 or anti-MPO autoantibodies will
bind to the respective antigen in the microtiter wells. After washing to remove any
unbound serum proteins, horseradish peroxidase conjugated rabbit anti human IgG, is
added and incubated. Following another washing step, the peroxidase substrate
(TMB) is added and incubated for an additional period of time. If the HRP enzyme
conjugate is present in the well, it will react with the substrate and produce a blue
color. A stop solution is then added to each well to terminate the enzyme reaction
and to stabilize the color development. The optical density of the color reaction is
measured by spectrophotometry. The amount of antigen specific bound antibody is

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
For each of the device, eight samples with different autoantibody
concentrations were used in the reproducibility studies. Samples were
assayed 20 times in one run for the intra-assay reproducibility study and 4
times on 4 different runs for the inter-assay reproducibility study. The assay
specification was <12% CV. Results are summarized below.

The inter-lot reproducibility for each device was determined by testing 6 QC
samples with different autoantibody concentrations for two runs on three lots
of kits. Speciation was set at <12% CV. Results are summarized in the
following table.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
For each device, six samples with different autoantibody concentrations were
serially diluted to cover the assay range. For each sample, there were four
dilutions and the dilution factor for each was dependent on the autoantibody
concentration. Results showed the assays were linear for the specified assay
range.
The assay ranges for anti-PR3 and anti-MPO are 12-158 RU/ML and 7-181
RU/mL respectively.

There is no reference standard for anti-PR3 and anti-MPO. The calibrators,
positive and negative controls are prepared in-house and arbitrary units are
assigned during development process.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit is determined by assaying the sample buffer 20 times in
one run. The mean and standard deviation (SD) were calculated. The
detection limit is defined as 3SD above the mean value of the sample buffer
and is approximately 1 RU/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference by endogenous substances: Aliquots of three samples were spiked
with three different concentrations of endogenous substances, namely
hemoglobin, bilirubin and triglyceride were tested on both anti-PR3 and anti-
MPO devices. The acceptance criterion for the mean % recovery ranged from
89% to 115%. Both devices did not appear to be affected by hemoglobin (up
to 1000 mg/dL), bilirubin (up to 40 mg/dL) and triglyceride (up to 2000
mg/dL).
Cross-reactivity: One hundred and sixteen samples from patients with other
autoimmune diseases (34 SLE, 5 Ulcerative colitis (UC), 4 Crohns, 23 PBC,
30 glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and 20 RA) were tested by both
devices. No cross-reactivity was observed for the samples tested.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off value of 20 RU/mL was based on testing 148 normal serum and
155 patient sera [113 Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG), 16 Churg-Strauss
syndrome (CSS), 13 Polyarteritis nodosa (PN), 11 Microscopic arteritis
(MA)]. All normal sera were negative with the 20 RU/mL cut-off.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Anti-PR3
Testing was performed on 270 samples which included 148 samples from
healthy adults, 37 WG, 5 CSS, 9 PN, 5 MA, 34 SLE, 5 UC, 4 Crohns and 23
PBC on the new device and the predicate device, Bindazyme Anti-PR3
ELISA. Two samples (one SLE and one PBC) were positive with the
predicate device and negative with the new device. Results are summarized in
table below.

The same 270 samples were also tested on the EUROIMMUN Anti-MPO
ELISA and the predicate device, Bindazyme Anti-MPO ELISA. Three
samples (two SLE and one PBC) were positive with the predicate device and
negative with the new device. Results are summarized in table below.

Negative percent agreement: 100% (243/243)
Overall percent agreement: 98.9% (267/270)
Other studies to support performance:
Study 1: 342 clinically defined samples from patients with the following
diagnosis: 113 WG, 16 CSS, 13 PN, 11 MA and 208 healthy subjects were
evaluated internally. Sex and age distribution of the subjects were provided.
The Anti-PR3 device was positive only for the WG patient samples and the
Anti-MPO device for the CSS, PN and MA samples. None of the samples
from the healthy controls reacted in either device.
Study 2: This study used the same samples for the k051489 which was for the
EUROIMMUN ANCA IFA Granulocyte BIOCHIP MOSAIC Test to
determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Anti-MPO device. Sera
samples used consisted of 30 microscopic polyangitis (MPA), 327 sera from
patients with other autoimmune diseases (WG, RA, SLE, MCTD, Sjogren’s
syndrome and scleroderma) and 206 normal blood donors. Of the MPA
samples, 53% (16/30) were positive as compared to 0.6% (3/533) in the
control group (other autoimmune diseases and blood donors combined). One
of the false positive samples was from a patient with WG. When compared to
EUROIMMUN ANCA IFA, the % positive agreement for the MPA group
was 93.3% (14/15), % negative agreement was 86.7% (13/15) and total
agreement was 90% (27/30). As for the control group, the % total agreement
was 99.2% (529/533).
b. Matrix comparison:
EDTA, heparin and citrate plasmas are claimed as additional sample types to
serum. Comparison studies were performed by testing 15 matched
serum/plasma pairs for each anti-coagulant. The concentration of the samples
ranged from 14-187 RU/mL for anti-PR3 and 10-181 RU/mL for anti-MPO.
The samples were also serially diluted and linear regression analyses were
performed in addition to mean % recovery for each serum/plasma pair.
Results are summarized below:

MPO IgG ELISA, the incidence of anti-MPO IgG in a German cohort of
Microscopic polyangitis was 53%.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
