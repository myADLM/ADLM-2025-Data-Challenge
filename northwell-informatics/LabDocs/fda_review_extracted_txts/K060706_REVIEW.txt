a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not Applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The D-glucose used in this control is traceable to an in-house glucose
preparation.
The stability of the product was determined by accelerated and real-time
stability studies. Accelerated studies were performed at 37, 45 and 56 ˚C.
Using the Arrhenius model, the results indicated shelf life stability for 24
months according to the sponsor’s criterion of ≤ 5 % loss. Real time studies
are on-going to confirm accelerated findings. The open vial stability was
determined by testing simulated use of opening vial for 10 minutes then
closed. The results indicated open vial stability for 90 days according to the
sponsor’s criterion of ≤ 5 % loss from day 1.
The expected values for the monitors were determined by testing three lots of
strips in replicates of 10. The mean, standard deviation and % CV were
