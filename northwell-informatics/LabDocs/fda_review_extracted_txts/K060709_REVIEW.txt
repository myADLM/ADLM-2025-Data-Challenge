L. Test Principle:
In particle agglutination assays, the degree of agglutination is inversely proportional
to the quantity of free drug in the reaction cell. If no drug is present in the sample,
the antibodies in the Multigent Gentamicin Antibody Reagent (R1) will bind only to
the bound drug on the particle which will cause it to agglutinate and will result in
higher absorbance. If increased amount of competing drug is present in the sample,
this will result in decreased binding of bound drug by the antibody, resulting in a
relative decrease in particle agglutination, which will result in lower absorbance.
Therefore, the absorbance is inversely proportional to the concentration of drug.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three control levels (Low Control, Mid Control, and High Control) were
evaluated on the ARCHITECT c8000 and, after 2 hours within the same day,
the samples were re-run in duplicate, over 20 days resulting in a total of 80
replicates for each control. Calibration was performed initially and re-
calibration was performed when the controls did not recover within labeled
ranges. Results for precision are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range of the assay is 0.34 – 10.0 μg/mL (highest calibrator).
The sponsor evaluated the recovery of samples across most of the measuring
range. Two groups of samples were used ranging from 1.72 to 6.88 μg/mL
and 0.25 to 8.00 μg/mL. Samples were prepared by spiking and dilution. The

Linear regression analysis gave the following:
Study 1: Observed = 1.0657(Expected) – 0.15; r = 0.9989
Study 2: Observed = 1.01(Expected) – 0.024; r = 0.9999
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Multigent Gentamicin Calibrators the assay utilizes are currently
marketed and were cleared under k981706. Calibration is stable for 28 days
for this assay.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) (defined by the sponsor as the analytical
concentration at which the precision of the assay [%CV] is less than 20% and
the accuracy is within 10%) was determined by diluting a patient sample with
known concentration gentamicin with human serum (negative for gentamicin)
to achieve an approximate concentration of 0.5 μg/mL. This sample was
further diluted with negative serum to achieve approximate gentamicin
concentrations of 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1 μg/mL. All samples were then run on
an ARCHITECT c8000 System. The data submitted supports a LoQ of 0.33
μg/mL. The sponsor will claim a higher LoQ of 0.34 mg/dL in the labeling.
Results of this study are summarized below.

The Least Dectectable Does (LDD) or analytical sensitivity (the lowest
amount of analyte in a sample that can be distinguished from zero with 95%
confidence) was determined. The sponsor claims a LDD of 0.1 μg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Serum samples with gentamicin stock concentrations of 2.46 and 3.44 ug/mL
were spiked with bilirubin (20 mg/dL), hemoglobin (2000 mg/dL),
triglyceride (1691 mg/dL), total protein (12 g/dL), and Rheumatoid Factor
(582 IU) and run in triplicate (hemoglobin in duplicate). The endogenous
substances above were found not to interfere within the sponsor’s percent
recovery acceptance criteria of 100±10%. HAMA Type-1 and Type-2
samples were also spiked with 3.33 ug/mL gentamicin. HAMA Type-1 and
Type-2 were found not to interfere (percent recovery within 100±10%).
For the Common Co-Administered Drugs study, two amounts of gentamicin
were present in the samples used: 1.5µg/mL and 3.5µg/mL. The following
nine test samples had 1.5µg/mL of gentamicin present during testing with a
range of 1.55µg/mL to 1.59µg/mL: Theophylline, Cyclosporin, Rifampicin,
Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen, Penicillin V, Phenylbutazone, Acetylsalicylic acid
and Metronidazole. All other samples had 3.5µg/mL of gentamicin present
during testing with a range of 3.51µg/mL to 3.88µg/mL. The interference
results are listed in the package insert.
Cross-reactivity of 50.35% was observed for sisomicin.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Sixty-eight purchased clinical samples were tested (ranging from 0.22 μg/mL
to 9.97 μg/mL). A Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed
comparing device results to predicate results. Results of the analysis gave the
following linear regression statistics:
Device = 1.122(Predicate) – 0.445; r = 0.996

b. Matrix comparison:
A study was conducted to determine the performance of the assay for both
serum and plasma samples containing gentamicin.
Blood was drawn from ten healthy donors (with no gentamicin therapy) for
each tube type listed below:
• Plastic K2 EDTA tube
• Glass K3 EDTA tube
• Glass plasma separator lithium heparin tube
• Glass sodium heparin tube
• Glass lithium heparin tube
• Glass serum separator tube
• Plastic tube with clot activator
• Glass tube with no additives
• Plastic tube with no additives.
The serum or plasma was removed from the collection tubes and aliquoted
into new tubes for testing (which is the same procedure the customer would
use). Serum or plasma from each tube was then spiked with gentamicin. The
samples were analyzed on the ARCHITECT c8000 analyzer in duplicate with
baseline results obtained on day zero for each type of tube. Results support
that the collection tubes evaluated show no adverse effects on gentamicin
(recovery within 100 +/- 10%).
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor cites a therapeutic range for gentamicin for moderate infections as 2
– 8 μg/mL. Peak serum levels of 5 -10 μg/mL have been shown to cause renal
