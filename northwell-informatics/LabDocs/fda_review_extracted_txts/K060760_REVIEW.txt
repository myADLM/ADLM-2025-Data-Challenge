H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
‘RapidOne’ – Buprenorphine Test is a one-step lateral flow immunoassay for the
qualitative detection of 12.5 ng/mL of buprenorphine in human urine.

perform, but should not be used without proper supervision. The immunoassay is
1

--- Page 2 ---
a simplified, qualitative screening method that provides only a preliminary result
for use in determining the need for additional or confirmatory testing, i.e. liquid
chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS).
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The device is for in vitro diagnostic prescription use.
‘RapidOne’ – Buprenorphine Test provides only a preliminary analytical result.
A specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a more
confirmed result. LC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical and
professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result.
Particularly when preliminary results are used.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable. The device is a visually read single-use device.
I. Device Description:
The assay employed in the ‘RapidOne’ – Buprenorphine Test is based on the same
principle of highly specific reactions between antigens and antibodies. This assay is a
one-step, competitive, immunoassay for the detection of buprenorphine and
buprenorphine glucuronide in human urine. The test device consists of a membrane
strip onto which a drug conjugate has been mobilized and a colloidal gold-antibody
complex is dried at one end of the membrane. In the absence of any drug in the urine
sample, the colloidal gold-antibody complex moves with the urine by capillary action
to contact the immobilized drug conjugate. Antibody-antigen reactions occur,
forming visible lines in the “test” area.
When drug is present in the urine sample, the drug or metabolite will compete with
the drug conjugate in the test area for the limited antibody sites on the colloid gold-
labeled antibody complex. If sufficient amount of drug is present, it will fill all of the
available antibody binding sites, preventing attachment of the labeled antibody to the
drug conjugate. An absence of a color band (line) in the “test” area is indicative of a
positive result.
A control band (line), comprised of a different antibody/antigen reaction, is present
on the membrane strip. The control line is not influenced by the presence or absence
of drug in the urine and should be present on all reactions.
A negative test will produce two colored bands, and a sample with drug above the
cut-off will produce only one band.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the assay was determined by using commercially available
standards and two different lots of the device. Buprenorphine and
buprenorphine glucuronide were added to drug-free urine to produce the
appropriate concentrations. Each sample at each concentration was tested 4
times, twice daily, for 5 days. Results are summarized below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor did not indicate any degree of traceability for their devices.
Control materials are required but are not specifically identified in the
labeling. No calibrators are required. The device is calibrated during the
manufacturing process.
d. Detection limit:
Sensitivity of qualitative assays may be characterized by validating
performance around the claimed cutoff concentration of the assay, and
demonstrating the lowest concentration of drug that is capable of or
consistently producing a positive result. This information appears in the
precision section, above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Each of the following compounds was added to normal, drug-free urine and
will give a positive result at the concentration stated. The sponsor tested 561
substances each at a concentration of 100,000 ng/mL. Those substances that
were found to give a positive result then had the concentration of the
substance diluted to establish the lowest level of the substance that will give a
positive result. These concentrations are summarized below.

The effect of pH of urine was tested to evaluate the effect on the reactivity of
the test. Drug-free urine was adjusted to various pH levels by the addition of
NaOH or HCl to create samples ranging from 3.0 to 11.0. Exogenous
buprenorphine was added to the pH adjusted specimens to give a final
concentration of 12.5 and 10.0 ng/mL respectively. It was found that the
range of pH tested did not interfere with the test.
The effect of specific gravity of urine was tested to evaluate the effect on the

reactivity of the test. Drug-free urine (certified by GC/MS) with a specific
gravity of 1.020 was diluted to produce urine with lower specific gravity
values ranging from 1.000 to 1.020. Exogenous buprenorphine was added to
the specific gravity adjusted specimens to give a final concentration of 12.5
and 10.0 ng/mL respectively. It was found that the range of specific gravity
tested did not interfere with the test.
f. Assay cut-off:
Buprenorphine at 12.5 ng/mL. See precision/reproducibility above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The “RapidOne’ – Buprenorphine Test was compared to results obtained with
LC/MS using 101 clinical specimens. Of the 109 samples, 54 were found to
be drug-free and 55 tested positive by LC/MS. The LC/MS analyses included
a hydrolysis step that removes glucuronide from buprenorphine. With this
method, buprenorphine-glucuronide present in the sample will be detected as
buprenorphine. The 55 positive specimens showed buprenorphine
concentrations of 4.2 to 89.0 ng/mL. All specimens containing 9.2 ng/mL or
greater, were found to be positive by the screening test. Results are
summarized below.
