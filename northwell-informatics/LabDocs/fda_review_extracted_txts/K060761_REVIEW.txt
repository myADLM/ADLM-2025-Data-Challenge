The BreathScan Alcohol Detector is an in vitro medical device to qualitatively
detect the presence of alcohol in the human breath. It is a disposable screening
device for one-time use. The detector is available at several detection cut-offs

Not applicable.
I. Device Description:
The BreathScan Alcohol Detector is a qualitative visually read single-use device. The
device contains yellow crystals inside a 2-part glass vessel, which is housed inside a
plastic tube. One end of the plastic tube is open for sample collection and immediate
testing of human breath for alcohol. The device is available at four different detection
levels (0.02, 0.04, 0.05 and 0.08% BAC).

L. Test Principle:
The BreathScan Alcohol Detector contains chemicals that change color in the
presence of alcohol in human breath. The detector is squeezed to break the glass
vessel which contains the chemically coated yellow crystals. The user blows into the
open end of the plastic tube allowing the breath to come in contact with the yellow
crystals. A color change from yellow to blue-green will occur if the alcohol in the
breath is at or above the detection limit of the device.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The BreathScan Alcohol Detector was not eligible for testing by the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (Department of Transportation
(DOT)). The sponsor performed DOT-like testing using the guidelines found in the
August 1994 NHTSA/DOT Model Specifications for Alcohol Screening Devices.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed precision and accuracy testing for each of the four
BreathScan Alcohol Detectors (.02, .04, .05 and .08 BAC) using a Breath
Alcohol Sample Simulator (BASS), which provides an alcohol-in-air test
sample with known alcohol concentrations, flow rate and air composition.
Testing was performed by 43 individuals under five different lighting sources
using sixty randomized pre-reacted detectors. The concentrations used were
20 detectors at 0% BAC, 20 at 60% below the cut-off concentration and 20 at
60% above the cut-off concentration. The table below describes the number
of devices that resulted in the expected outcome (positive or negative) of the
number of devices evaluated.

The NHTSA guidelines do not specifically address the detection limit of
breath alcohol devices but require testing at a %BAC of zero (blank reading)
to assess the possibility of false positives. The sponsor included a zero
concentration samples in their precision study above. Non-alcoholic human
breath was used as the sample. All of the devices tested except for the .04
detector under Fluorescent lighting, did not produced a false positive when
measuring zero concentration samples. The .04 detector showed one false
positive result when read under a Fluorescent light.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed the following studies for each cut-off concentration
(0.02, 0.04, 0.05 and 0.08% BAC) to evaluate the potential interference on the
test results from cigarette smoke, temperature and vibration.
Cigarette smoke – An alcohol-free volunteer was asked to smoke
approximately one half of a cigarette. The volunteer then performed a breath
alcohol reading. The volunteer then smoked another inhalation and repeated
test to produce a total of five trials for each cut-off concentration. The
BreathScan Alcohol Detector produced no false positives results under these
conditions.
Temperature – The sponsor assessed the effect of temperature at 10 and at 40
ºC. A total of forty different devices were stored at each temperature for each
cut-off concentration. Using simulated breath (BASS) twenty samples that
were 60% below the device cut-off and twenty samples were 60% above the
cut-off were tested. The results are presented in the table below:

Vibration - A total of forty different devices were mounted on a shaketable or
rocker for each cut-off concentration for 5 minutes. Using simulated breath
(BASS) twenty samples that were 60% below the device cut-off and twenty
samples were 60% above the cut-off were tested. The results are presented in
the table below:

f. Assay cut-off:
Each device will produce a blue-green color at or above the following cut-off
concentration, .02, .04, .05 and .08 %BAC.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor conducted a consumer study comparing the BreathScan Alcohol
Detector .04% BAC to a quantitative comparator device device. The purpose
of the study was to determine if consumers could correctly perform and
interpret the test according to the package insert. There were 24 paired
volunteers (drinker, non-drinker). The reported age range of the volunteers
was from below 30 to 60 years of age. There were 18 males and 30 females
who participated in the trail. The non-drinker administered the test to the
drinker and then read the results. The drinker then provided another breath
sample, which was analyzed using the quantitative device operated by a
trained individual. The breath alcohol concentrations ranged from a BAC of
0.00% to 0.144% by the predicate device.
Ninety-three breath alcohol tests were performed and the results are in the
table below:
