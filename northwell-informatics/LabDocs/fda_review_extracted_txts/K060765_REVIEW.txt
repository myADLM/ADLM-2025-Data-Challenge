H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The HemoCue Glucose 201 RT system is used for quantitative determination of glucose
in whole blood supplementing the clinical evidence in the diagnosis and treatment of
patients with diabetes. The HemoCue Glucose 201 RT system is for In Vitro Diagnostic
use only. The HemoCue Glucose 201 RT Analyzer is only to be used with HemoCue
Glucose 201 RT Microcuvettes. For professional use only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The device is for in vitro diagnostic prescription use.
The assay is intended for use in point-of-care settings and the appropriate studies were
done. This claim, however, is not included in the Indications for Use statement.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The microcuvettes and HemoCue 201 RT analyzer are not intended for use with other
components. They are mutually exclusive.
I. Device Description:
The HemoCue Glucose 201 RT Analyzer is a portable device. The main parts are the cuvette
holder (brings the microcuvette in correct measuring position), the optronic unit (a
photometer which performs the measurement in the microcuvette) a display, a power adaptor
and embedded software.
The single-use Microcuvette contains reagents deposited on its inner walls and serves both as
a pipette and as a measuring cuvette. A blood sample of approximately 4 µL is drawn into
the cavity by capillary action. The filled microcuvette is inserted into the HemoCue
Analyzer. The measurement takes place in the analyzer in which the transmittance is
measured and the absorbance and glucose level is calculated. The calibration of the analyzer
is traceable to the ID (Isotope Dilution) GC-MS method. The HemoCue is factory calibrated
and needs no further calibration. The reportable range is 12-560 mg/dL.
The instrument may be customized for use with or without plasma conversion of whole blood
measurements. Plasma equivalents are determined by multiplying the whole blood reading
by a factor of 1.1.
The sponsor indicates the device does not contain human source material.

L. Test Principle:
The chemical reaction in the cavity of the HemoCue Glucose 201 RT microcuvettes has two
phases, hemolysis and the glucose reaction. The glucose reaction is a modified glucose
dehydrogenase method in which a tetrazolium salt (MTT) is used to obtain a quantification of
glucose in visible light. β-D-glucose is transformed to β-D-glucose using mutarotase.
Glucose dehydrogenase acts as a catalyst for the oxidation of β-D-glucose, to form NADH,
which in the presence of diaphorase produces a colored formazan with MTT. The measure-
ment takes place in the analyzer in which the transmittance is measured and the absorbance
and glucose level is calculated.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Studies were conducted according to CLSI EP-5A guidance “Evaluation of Precision
Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices; Approved Guidelines.” One batch of
Microcuvettes, 5 analyzers, 5 operators, and 3 levels of commercial control were used in
the study. Each operator ran duplicate samples twice a day for 20 days. Four hundred
samples were run at each level. Results of the studies are presented below.

Precision was also established in POC studies. See the Method Comparison data
in section M2, below.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To verify linearity, the sponsor followed “Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative
Analytical methods”, CLSI Document EP6-A Vol. 21 No. 28. Five HemoCue 201 RT
analyzers were used in the study. Four replicates per level were evaluated on each
analyzer. Whole blood concentrations and plasma equivalent converted results
(multiplied by 1.1) both appear linear. Samples were EDTA whole blood hemolysates
spiked with Glucose to eleven different concentrations ranging from 10-600 mg/dL.
Results of the study support the claimed reportable range (12-560 mg/dL).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
No calibrators are required. The device is factory calibrated. Calibration is traceable to
an ID-GCMS (Isotope Dilution- Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry) system.
Users are instructed to follow local, state, and federal guidelines regarding quality control
procedures.
A commercial control material is identified in the labeling, i.e., Eurotrol GlucoTrol-NG.
This control was originally cleared during the review of k964053 under the name
HemoCue GlucoTrol-NG.
The instrument contains electronic checks which validates that inputs from the LEDs are
linear to the output signal of the detector. The sponsor states this indicates the electronics
in the device are stable.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor determined the lower limit of detection (LLD) for the HemoCue Glucose
201 RT system, defined as the lowest concentration which is measured by the analyzer
with precision less than or equal to a 20 % CV. To establish this, EDTA samples were
aged to concentrations down to 10 mg/dL and analyzed in replicates on multiple
analyzers. A concentration of 12 mg/dL generated a 20% CV.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor evaluated the potential for interference from different compounds, proteins
and pH levels. The cross reactivity of the enzyme Glucose Dehydrogenase (GDH) with
various types of sugar species was also evaluated. The accepted deviation between the
test sample (containing the interfering substance) and the mean values for the reference
sample (not having the interferents) was < 10%. Warnings are included in labeling for
those with greater than 10% difference.
The sponsor states that they followed “Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry”, CLSI
Document EP7-A vol. 22 No 27. The cross-reactivity of the sugar species was analyzed
according to an internal procedure.
Five replicates were run on each of five HemoCue Glucose 201 RT analyzers. Results
appear below:
