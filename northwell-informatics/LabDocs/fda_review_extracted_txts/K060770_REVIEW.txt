I. Device Description:
The VITROS Anti-HAV IgM assay is performed using the VITROS
Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-HAV IgM Reagent Pack and the VITROS
Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-HAV IgM Calibrator on the VITROS ECi/ECiQ
Immunodiagnostic System (VITROS Immunodiagnostic System). An antibody class
capture technique is used. This involves dilution of the sample and the simultaneous
reaction of human IgM in the diluted sample with biotinylated mouse monoclonal
anti-human IgM antibody. The immune complex is captured by streptavidin on the
wells. Unbound materials are removed by washing. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-
labeled mouse monoclonal anti-HAV antibody which has been complexed with
inactivated HAV antigen (conjugate) is then captured by anti-HAV specific IgM
bound to the wells. Unbound material is removed by washing.
The bound HRP conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. A reagent
containing luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt) and an
electron transfer agent, is added to the wells. The HRP in the bound conjugate
catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative, producing light. The electron
2

--- Page 3 ---
transfer agent (a substituted acetanilide) increases the level of light produced and
prolongs its emission. The light signals are read by the VITROS Immunodiagnostic
System. The binding of HRP conjugate is indicative of the presence of anti-HAV
IgM.
The VITROS Anti-HAV IgM Reagent Pack is composed of streptavidin coated wells,
biotinylated antibody reagent (biotin-mouse monoclonal anti-human IgM) in buffer
with antimicrobial agent, and conjugate reagent (HRP-mouse monoclonal anti-HAV)
in buffer with antimicrobial agent. The VITROS Anti-HAV IgM Calibrator is human
anti-HAV IgM positive plasma from donors tested individually and found negative
for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibodies to human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV 1+2) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). The VITROS Anti-HAV IgM Controls
are a negative control (freeze-dried normal human plasma with antimicrobial agent,
obtained from HBsAg, HIV 1+2 and HCV negative donors), and a positive control
(also contains human anti-HAV IgM positive plasma, from HBsAg, HIV 1+2 and
HCV negative donors).

issued February 9, 2006
L. Test Principle:
Immunoassay, qualitative determination of IgM antibody to HAV in human body
fluids using antibody class capture technique followed by chemiluminescence
detection. The light signals are read by the VITROS Immunodiagnostic System. The
binding of HRP conjugate is indicative of the presence of anti-HAV IgM.
Assay Type Assay Time and Temperature
Incubation time: 32 minutes
Immunometric
Time to first result: 43 minutes
(Antibody Class capture)
Temperature: 37°C
Reaction scheme:
Results are calculated as a normalized signal, relative to a cut-off value (signal/cutoff,
s/c). During the calibration process a lot-specific parameter, encoded on the lot
calibration card, is used to determine a valid stored cut-off value for the VITROS
Immunodiagnostic System. Results are automatically calculated by the VITROS
Immunodiagnostic System.
Result = Signal for test sample
Cut-off value
Patient sample results will be displayed with a “Negative”, “Borderline” or
“Reactive” label. An initial result labeled “Borderline” indicates a sample that
requires duplicate repeat testing for anti-HAV IgM in order to determine a final
reactive or negative result relative to the cutoff.

Detection of anti-HAV IgM does not necessarily imply an acute HAV infection due
to the longevity of anti-HAV IgM. The detection of anti-HAV IgM can be useful for
the differential diagnosis of hepatitis A from other forms of viral hepatitis. Testing
with other hepatitis markers is required.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated based on the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (formerly NCCLS) protocol EP5. The precision panel consisting of 4
samples (a negative, a negative close to the cut-off, a positive close to the cut-
off and a positive) was prepared and shipped to 3 different sites. Two
replicates of each of 4 panel samples were assayed at each of the 3 different
sites once per day for at least 20 different days, over two calibration intervals.
The experiment was performed using 1 reagent lot on three different VITROS
Immunodiagnostic Systems at three different sites. The data presented is a

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) has been determined to be 0.04 s/c.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Each quoted mean value is derived from a minimum of 10 assays. The
standard deviation is that which would be anticipated for singleton
determinations of each control in a number of different laboratories using
different reagent lots. Quoted values are lot specific.
Vitros Anti-HAV IgM Controls - Baseline Statistics:
Control Mean Result SD
1 (Negative) 0.10 0.10
2 (Positive) 2.14 0.327
Calibration is lot specific; reagent packs and calibrators are linked by lot
number. A Master Calibration is established for each new reagent lot by
performing multiple assays. This is the process by which a lot-specific
parameter [a] which links the cut-off value to the calibrator signal is
determined.
Cut-off value = (a x Signal of CAL1)
The lot-specific parameter, the expected calibrator signal and the data which
enables a System to calculate the cut-off value, are encoded on the lot
calibration card. Scanning the lot calibration card loads the encoded data onto
the System. When the calibrator is processed the validity of the calibration is
assessed against a quality parameter which compares the actual signal of the
calibrator with the expected signal. If the calibration is acceptable the cut-off
value is calculated and stored for use with any reagent pack of that lot. The
quality of calibration cannot be completely described by a single parameter.
The calibration report should be used in conjunction with control values to
determine the validity of the calibration. Recalibration is required after a
predetermined calibration interval, or when a different reagent lot is loaded.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection (LoD) has been determined to be 0.33 s/c.

e. Analytical specificity:
The specificity of the VITROS Anti-HAV IgM assay was evaluated by testing
189 samples from the following potentially cross-reacting sub-groups (see
table below). All initially reactive samples were tested with a reference assay
for confirmation. None of these categories were found to interfere with the
VITROS Anti-HAV IgM assay.
Of the 189 samples tested, two (2) were observed to be discordant.

The cut-off signal was established as the light signal which gives the best
discrimination between anti- HAV IgM reactive and anti-HAV IgM negative
sample populations, to provide optimum specificity and sensitivity for the
assay. The cut-off signal level was assigned a result of 1.00. Assay results <
0.8 s/c indicate a negative sample, negative for anti-HAV IgM. Assay results
≥ 1.20 s/c indicate a reactive sample, positive for anti-HAV IgM. A result of
≥0.8 and <1.2 s/c indicates a borderline sample.

Performance of the VITROS Anti-HAV IgM Assay in Known Anti-HAV
IgM Reactive Subjects:
The performance of the VITROS Anti-HAV IgM assay was evaluated among
serum samples from subjects known to be anti-HAV IgM positive. A total of
77 samples collected in Egypt (N=50) and India (N=27) from subjects with a
medical history and laboratory results indicative of acute hepatitis A were
tested concurrently with the VITROS and reference anti-HAV IgM assays.
The VITROS Anti-HAV IgM assay was reactive and in 100% agreement with
the reference anti-HAV IgM assay in all 77 anti-HAV IgM reactive samples.
The positive percent agreement of the VITROS Anti-HAV IgM assay with the
reference anti-HAV IgM assay and the 95% exact confidence interval are
presented in the following table.

were reactive with the VITROS or reference anti-HAV IgM assays.
Performance of the VITROS Anti-HAV IgM Assay in Cord Blood:
A total of 20 cord blood samples (as a surrogate for neonate serum) and 10
adult serum samples were tested in the VITROS Anti-HAV IgM assay. None
of the samples were found to give a reactive result in the VITROS Anti-
HAV IgM assay. Thirty microliters (30 μl) of anti-HAV IgM positive
material was added to 270 μl of cord blood and adult serum.

Seroconversion Panels
Three seroconversion panels each having at least 5 individual samples with a
known predetermined result were measured in the VITROS Anti-HAV IgM
assay and in a reference assay. The VITROS and reference anti-HAV IgM
assay results are summarized below. The VITROS Anti-HAV IgM assay gave
seroconversion sensitivity equivalent to or more sensitive than a reference
assay in the three panels tested, although it appears to detect IgM for a longer
period than the comparator assay for qualitative determination of IgM
antibody to hepatitis A.

HAV Prevalence Population
The expected results of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-HAV IgM
assay to detect anti-HAV IgM was determined in presumably healthy individuals
from both high (Western US) and low (Eastern US) HAV disease prevalence
areas in the United States. The population was 50% male and 50% female, with
ages that ranged from 18 to 89. The majority of the subjects were
White/Caucasian (72.0%). Other ethnic groups tested were African American
(12.0%), Hispanic/Latino (15.0%) and Asian (1.0%).
The expected results for presumably healthy individuals living in either high or
low prevalence areas are presented below. Two individuals of the low prevalence
population produced a positive result in the VITROS Anti-HAV IgM assay

Adult Subjects at High Risk for Viral Hepatitis
Expected results of asymptomatic individuals from the multi-center study
described in “Performance Characteristics” are provided below. Approximately
74.2% (650/876) of the 876 prospective subjects enrolled in the US reported no
recent or current signs or symptoms of hepatitis. Of these 650 asymptomatic
individuals, 8.0% were enrolled in Miami, FL, 46.2% were enrolled in Dallas,
TX, and 45.8% were enrolled in Chicago, IL. The group was Caucasian (25.5%),
African American (55.1%) and Hispanic (14.9%), with the remaining 4.5%
represented by other ethnic groups. The group was 58.8% male and 41.2% female
and ranged in age from 16 to 81 years. All were at risk for viral hepatitis due to
lifestyle, behavior, occupation or known exposure event. The VITROS Anti-HAV
IgM assay was reactive in 0.5% of the individuals in this group. The percent
VITROS Anti-HAV IgM reactive results observed in the asymptomatic
population at each collection site was 0.31% at Chicago, IL, and 0.15% at Dallas,
TX. The expected results for the VITROS Anti-HAV IgM assay in subjects at
high risk for viral hepatitis are presented in the following table.
