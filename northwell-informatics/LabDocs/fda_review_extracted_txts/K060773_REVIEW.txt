L. Test Principle:
The assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay technique used for the quantitative
analysis of procainamide in human serum or plasma. The assay is based on competition
between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for antibody binding sites. Enzyme activity decreases upon
binding to the antibody, so the drug concentration in the sample can be measured in terms
of enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD) to NADH, resulting in an absorbance change that is measured
spectrophotometrically. Endogenous serum G6PDH does not interfere because the
coenzyme functions only with the bacterial (Leuconostoc mesenteroids) enzyme
employed in the assay.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

three lots of product. Onboard (opened and refrigerated) stability is claimed as
60 days.
Calibrators: The Preciset TDM II Calibrators are prepared to contain known
quantities of procainamide in normal human serum and are traceable to USP
reference standards. These calibrators are used to establish a standard curve
from which the quantity of drug in unknown specimens can be determined.
Please see 510(k) k031856 for more information.
Controls: The TDM Control Set contains liquid controls based on human
serum and are traceable to USP reference standards. Please see 510(k)
k060429 for more information.
d. Detection limit:
The manufacturer’s claimed a lower assay limit of 0.33 ug/mL. This claim
was determined by measuring the absorbance values of 21 replicates of the
zero calibrator and adding two standard deviations to the mean of measured
values.
e. Analytical specificity:
The assay was evaluated on the Hitachi 917 for interference from drugs, and
endogenous compounds:
Cross-reactivity:
The following compounds were tested for cross-reactivity in serum samples
containing approximately 4.5 ug/mL procainamide. Results were compared to
those of control samples without cross-reactant. All compounds tested had
undetectable cross-reactivity (ND) at the listed concentration, defined by the
manufacturer as a difference in values less than the sensitivity of the assay.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A comparison of the ONLINE TDM Procainamide assay on a Roche/Hitachi
917 analyzer (y) with a commercially available method (COBAS FP
Procainamide on a COBAS INTEGRA 700 analyzer) (x) gave the following
correlation (μg/mL) using 51 human serum samples:
Passing/Bablok:
y = 1.007 x + 0.247
r = 0.9975
SD (md 95) = 0.311
The sample concentrations were between 0.3 and 10.6 μg/mL.
A comparison of the ONLINE TDM Procainamide assay on a Roche/Hitachi
917 analyzer (y) with a commercially available method (EMIT 2000
Procainamide on a Roche/Hitachi 911 analyzer) (x) gave the following
correlation (μg/mL) using 48 human serum samples:
Passing/Bablok:
y = 0.981 x + 0.02
r = 0.997
SD (md 95) = 0.241
The sample concentrations were between 1.06 and 11.18 μg/mL.
b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor found serum and plasma equivalent with the following
anticoagulants: heparin (sodium or lithium), potassium (K2 or K3) EDTA,
citrate, and oxalate.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor states that the commonly accepted therapeutic range for
procainamide is 4 - 10 μg/mL (16.9 - 42.3 μmol/L) and the sum of procainamide
6

--- Page 7 ---
and its primary active metabolite, N-acetlyprocainamide (NAPA) is 5 - 30 μg/mL
(21.2 - 126.9 μmol/L). Procainamide is thought to be toxic at levels greater than
16 μg/mL (>67.7 μmol/L).
The factors that can influence the relationship between procainamide serum or
plasma concentrations and clinical response include: renal and circulatory
function, rate of acetylation, the severity and type of cardiac arrhythmia, general
state of health, and use of other drugs. The concentration of procainamide in
serum or plasma depends on the time of the last drug dose; mode of
administration; concomitant drug therapy; sample condition; time of sample
collection; and individual variations in absorption, biotransformation, distribution,
and excretion. These parameters must be considered when interpreting results.
Each laboratory should investigate the transferability of the expected values to its
own patient population and if necessary determine its own reference range.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
