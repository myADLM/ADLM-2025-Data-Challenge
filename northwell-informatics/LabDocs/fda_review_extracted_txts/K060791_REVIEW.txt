with the Triage Meters for the point-of-care qualitative determination of the
presence of drug and/or the major metabolites above the threshold concentrations
of up to 10 distinct drug classes, including assays for acetaminophen/paracetamol,
amphetamines, methamphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine,
methadone, opiates, phencyclidine, THC and tricyclic antidepressants in urine.
The acetaminophen/paracetamol assay will yield positive results when
acetaminophen/paracetamol is ingested at or above therapeutic doses.

This test provides only preliminary test results. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment must be applied to any drug of abuse test result,
particularly in evaluating a preliminary positive result. In order to obtain a
confirmed analytical result, a more specific alternate chemical method is needed.
Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory
method.
A quantitative serum acetaminophen/paracetamol measurement is the common
confirmatory method for preliminary positive acetaminophen/paracetamol results.

L. Test Principle:
The Triage Tox Drug Screen is a competitive fluorescence immunoassay used for the
qualitative determination of parent compound and major metabolites of drugs of
abuse in urine specimens. A urine sample is added to the device and moves through a
filter by capillary action into a reaction chamber. The sample is allowed to react with
murine monoclonal fluorescent antibody conjugates in competition with fluorescent
drug conjugates. After an incubation period, the reaction mixture flows through the
device detection lane. The presence of drug or drug metabolite in the urine specimen
prevents binding of the fluorescent conjugates to the solid phase on the detection
zone. Unbound fluorescent conjugate is washed from the detection lane by excess
urine. The concentration of the drug metabolite in the urine specimen is inversely
related to the fluorescence bound to the detection zone. Cutoff concentrations are
used to separate a negative result from a presumptive positive result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
See k043242 for acetaminophen. See k012745 for amphetamines, barbiturates,
benzodiazepines, cocaine, methamphetamines, opiates, phencyclidine, THC and
tricyclic antidepressants.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The cutoff for methadone of 300 ng//mL was challenged by testing
specimens containing the drug or drug metabolite spiked into drug-free urine
at concentrations within 25% and 50% of the threshold. Each specimen was
tested using the Triage Tox Drug Screen. The data paralleled the expected
agreement based on the coefficient of variation of the assay. The results are
presented in the table below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Users are instructed to run external controls with each new lot or shipment of
test materials, or every 30 days, and as otherwise required by federal, state or
local guidelines. Commercial control materials are required but are not
specifically identified in the labeling.
Each device has internal process controls which run with every sample. The
controls monitor various procedural and functional parameters such as
sufficient sample added to the test device and that the unbound fluorescent
label has been washed sufficiently from the detection zone. During testing if
the results are within the limits the results are reported. If the results are not
within the limits the results are not reported and an error message will be
displayed.
Real time stability studies have been conducted. Protocols and acceptance
criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims
the following expiration date:
When stored at 2-8˚C product is good until expiration date which is 3 months.
Real time studies are ongoing and the sponsor will extend the shelf-life as
appropriate. Once removed from refrigeration, the pouched test device is
stable for up to 14 days.
d. Detection limit:
Cutoff validation and sensitivity were evaluated. Four contrived samples were
prepared by adding methadone to drug-free urine at concentrations ±25% and
±50% of the 300 ng/mL cutoff concentration. Samples at ±25% were
measured 30 times and samples at ±50% were measured 10 times using the
Triage TOX Drug Screen. The results of the study are presented in the table
below.

e. Analytical specificity:
Potential interfering substances were added to samples containing methadone
at 25% above and below the cutoff concentration. Potential cross-reacting
substances were added to drug-free urine. Samples were measured in
duplicate. The substances did not interfere or cross-react with the methadone
assay at the concentrations listed below:

of each compound was determined gravimetrically. Six replicates of each
compound were evaluated. By analyzing various concentrations of similarly-
structured drug compounds, the sponsor determined the concentration of the
drug that produced a response equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the
assay. The results of these studies appear in the table below..
Cross Reactivity with Related Compounds
Compounds Conc. ng/mL X-reactivity
I-Methadone 1.75 Positive
d-methadone 14,000 Positive
d/l-methadone 300 Positive
Methadone was added at 75% and 125% of the cutoff concentration to urine
samples with specific gravities ranging from 1.006 – 1.025 and to urine
samples with the pH ranging from 4.5 – 8.0. Twenty (20) replicates of each
sample were measured using the Triage TOX Drug Screen. There was no
effect of specimen specific gravity or pH on the methadone assay results.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of the analytical performance around the claimed cutoff
concentration appears in precision and sensitivity sections, above.
The cutoff concentration of this qualitative assay was arbitrarily chosen by the
sponsor. There is no known clinical significance regarding the cutoff
concentration. It indicates only that the analyte was or was not present at that
level.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
One hundred and two clinical urine (102) specimens were tested with the
Methadone TOX Drug Screen and compared to a Gas Chromatography/Mass
Spectrophotometer (GC/MS). Sixty one (61) of the 102 specimens were neat
samples. Forty one (41) of the 102 were diluted once to obtain data around the
cutoff. All of the Triage TOX Drug Screen positive, GC/MS negative samples
contained measurable amounts of methadone (>100 ng/ml), and 8 of the 9
samples contained concentrations greater than the threshold value established
for l-methadone of 175 ng/mL.
Results from the study are presented below. The table describes the agreement
between the device and the GC/MS.
