b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range of the ARCHITECT SHBG assay is 0.1 to 250 nmol/L.
A study was conducted to verify that SHBG supplemented into human serum can be
accurately recovered by the ARCHITECT® SHBG assay. 10 human serum samples
of known concentration were spiked with additional SHBG resulting in samples
ranging from 9.4 – 249 nmol/L. The recovery by the ARCHITECT SHBG assay
ranged from 93 – 103%. The sponsor’s minimum acceptance criteria for spiked
recovery was 90-110%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators and controls are produced from in house master lots of calibrators and
controls. These materials are traceable to the World Health Organization’s
international standard - NIBSC code 95/560.
Calibrators:
The ARCHITECT® SHBG Calibrators are for the calibration of the ARCHITECT i
System when used for the quantitative determination of SHBG in human serum and
plasma. Calibrator A contains phosphate buffered saline with protein (goat) stabilizer.
Calibrators B to F contain SHBG (human, purified) in phosphate buffered saline with
protein (goat) stabilizer.
Preservatives: sodium azide and ProClin® 300.
Each SHBG Calibrator kit contains 6 bottles of ACHITECT Calibrators (2.0mL fill
volume per bottle) with the following concentrations:

Controls:
The ARCHITECT® SHBG Controls are for the verification of the accuracy and
precision of the ARCHITECT i System when used for the quantitative determination
of SHBG in human serum and plasma. The controls contain SHBG (human, purified)
in phosphate buffered saline with protein (goat) stabilizer. Preservatives: sodium
azide and ProClin® 300.
Each SHBG control kit contains 3 bottles of controls (4.0 mL fill volume per bottle)
with the following target concentrations:
Control Low - 9.0 nmol/L (target) 5.9 to 12.2 nmol/L (range)
Control Medium - 25.0 nmol/L (target) 16.3 to 33.8 nmol/L (range)
Control High - 150.0 nmol/L (target) 90.0 to 210.0 nmol/L (range)
Stability was determined using real time and accelerated studies based upon an in-
house protocol for the calibrators and controls. Protocols and acceptance criteria
were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity (Limit of Blank) of the ARCHITECT SHBG assay was
determined by testing ARCHITECT SHBG Calibrator A (0.0 μg/dL) in replicates of
20, on each of 3 instruments (i2000 and i2000 SR), using 2 lots of reagents (n = 6
runs). Analytical sensitivity was defined as the concentration at two standard
deviations (SD) from the mean of ARCHITECT SHBG Calibrator A rates, and
represents the lowest measurable concentration of analyte that can be distinguished
from zero. The analytical sensitivity was determined by using the corresponding
calibration curve for each run. The analytical sensitivity of the ARCHITECT SHBG
assay was calculated to be 0.02 nmol/L.
The potential for High dose hook testing was evaluated on the Architect i2000 SR
using two lots of reagents. High Dose Hook effect was tested on two sets of samples
with spiked SHBG with concentrations ranging from 78 to 10000 nmol/L. The matrix
of one set was calibrator A and the other was a human serum pool. Both sets of
samples were tested in triplicate with two lots of reagents. Samples exceeding the
calibration range were tested using dilution.

--- Page 10 ---
Reported concentrations for samples with a SHBG concentrations greater than
Calibrator F (250 nmol/L) were listed as higher than 250 nmol/L. No High Dose
Hook effect was observed up to 10000 nmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
A study was conducted to evaluate the potential cross-reactivity of the ARCHITECT
SHBG assay when tested with the following structurally similar compounds: AFP
(alpha fetoprotein), Cortisol, 11-Deoxycortisol, Estradiol, Testosterone, 5-
dihydrotestosterone, TG (thyroglobulin), TBG (thyroxin binding globulin) and
Transferrin. Aliquots of Calibrator A, containing essentially no residual SHBG, were
supplemented with each potential cross-reactant at the concentrations listed in the
table below. Each sample was tested in replicates of four using the ARCHITECT
SHBG assay based on CLSI Protocol EP7-A.

No cross-reactivity was observed in the ARCHITECT SHBG with samples
containing AFP, Cortisol, 11- Deoxycortisol, Estradiol, Testosterone, 5-
dihydrotestosterone, TG, TBG and Transferrin at the tested concentrations.
A study was conducted to evaluate the potential interference from hemoglobin,
bilirubin, triglycerides and protein (low and high level) on the ARCHITECT SHBG
assay.
Interference testing was performed on the Architect instrument using two lots of
reagents based on CLSI Protocol EP7-A. Ten (10) human serum and 10 EDTA
plasma based samples (SHBG values covering the assay range), were used to prepare
the test panel. Human specimens were spiked with the interferent and non spiked
samples were used as the control. All samples were analyzed in four replicates.
The sponsor defined non-interference as SHBG recovery within 90-110%.
There is no significant interference with added hemoglobin at 500 mg/dL.
There is no significant interference with added bilirubin at 20 mg/dL.
There is no significant interference with added triglyceride at 4000 mg/dL.
There is no significant interference with protein at 4 g/dL

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison was performed testing samples on Architect i2000 SR and i2000
using two lots of reagents at three sites. 626 samples were analyzed. Samples were
collected retrospectively. One aliquot of each sample were analyzed with the
Architect SHBG at three different sites. Another aliquot of these samples were also
analyzed on the Roche Elecsys E170 SHBG.
The results of the study yielded to following comparison data for the ARCHITECT
SHBG assay:
Device =1.06(Predicate) + 1.34; r2=0.922 n=626.
b. Matrix comparison:
20 unlinked, non-surplus fresh whole blood specimens from 20 different donors (10
males and 10 females) were collected in the following tube types: Serum clot tube (no
additive) – control tube, Serum separator tubes, K-EDTA, Li-Heparin, Na-
Fluoride/K-Oxalate, Na-Citrate, NH4-Heparin, Na-Heparin
The samples were analyzed in triplicate with one lot of SHBG reagents on the
ARCHITECT instrument. The sponsor defined non-interference as the mean
