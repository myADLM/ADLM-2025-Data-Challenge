J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
Predicate k964457, COBAS INTEGRA Tobramycin
Describe the item being compared
The Roche ONLINE TDM Tobramycin assay is substantially equivalent to other products in commercial distribution
intended for similar use. Most notably, it is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed Roche COBAS INTEGRA
Tobramycin (k964457).
The ONLINE TDM Tobramycin assay is for the quantitative determination of tobramycin in human serum or plasma on
Roche automated clinical chemistry analyzers. The proposed labeling indicates the Roche Hitachi 911, 912, 917 and
Modular P analyzers can be used with the Roche ONLINE TDM Tobramycin reagent kits.
Similarites
The new device and the predicate are both indicated for the quantitative determination of Tobramycin
In human serum or plasma on Roche automated clinical analyzers.
Differences
The ONLINE TDM Tobramycin uses a homogeneous microparticles agglutination immunoassay. In
Contrast, the Roche COBAS INTEGRA tobramycin assay utilizes a fluorescence polarization
immunoassay (FPIA) system.

L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay technique used for the
quantitative analysis of tobramycin in human serum or plasma. The assay is based on
competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for antibody binding sites. Enzyme activity
decreases upon binding to the antibody, so the drug concentration in the sample can
be measured in terms of enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts oxidized
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH, resulting in an absorbance
change that is measured spectrophotometrically. Endogenous serum G6PDH does not

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was conducted on control material and spiked human
serum pools using a modified version of CLSI-EP5-T2. The evaluation
included using triplicate samples, 3 runs per day over 21 days (n=63). The
results of the study met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria for within-run
precision (SD no greater than 0.14 up to a concentration of 2 μg/mL or CV
≤ 7% at higher concentrations) and total and between-day precision (SD
no greater than 0.18, up to a concentration of 2 μg/mL or CV ≤ 9% at
higher concentrations). The results are tabulated below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To assess the linearity of the assay, an 11-level dilution series was
prepared using tobramycin spiked human serum pool diluted with a
tobramycin negative human serum pool. The percent recoveries within the
reportable range (0.33 – 10.0 ug/mL) were 94.2-101.8% and met the
sponsor’s acceptance criteria of % recovery within ± 10% of the
theoretical value up to 10 μg/mL. Results were evaluated by linear
regression. The linearity results are tabulated below:

The sponsor evaluated the performance of the TDM Preciset
Multianalyte Calibrator diluent by comparing results of the diluted
samples with neat samples (8.6 and 9.3 ug/mL) and the results of
the diluted samples with spiked samples (12 and 17 ug/mL). The
sponsor’s acceptance criteria for these studies: percent (%)
difference ±10% of the values of the neat samples and the spiked
samples.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
The 18 month shelf life claim for the Online TDM Tobramycin
reagent was initially assessed by accelerated stability experiments
and followed up with real time stability experiments. The 60 days
on board instrument stability claim was assessed with real time
studies. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria was reviewed and found
to be acceptable.
Calibrators and controls were previously cleared (k060429 and
k031856) and are sold separately.
d. Detection limit:
The lower detection limit claim of 0.33 ug/ml is based on the mean
and two standard deviations of 21 determinations of zero calibrator
material. A linear interpolation model, based on these
determinations of the zero calibrator material well as five replicate
determinations of Calibrator B (1.0 ug/mL), was used to calculate
the concentration equivalent to the mean plus two standard
deviations.
e. Analytical specificity:

To evaluate potential interference from drugs and metabolites,
serum pools were spiked with potential interferents and
approximately 3 ug/ml tobramycin. Drugs found to cross-react at
high concentrations were run in a series of dilutions. Percent cross
reactivity for drugs and metabolites were defined as: [(Da-Dt)/C]
x100, where Dt = the measured concentration of the control
analyte, Da = measured concentration of the control analyte +
cross-reactant and C= known concentration of cross-reactant.
Calculated cross-reactivities are based on the median of triplicate
determinations Observed cross-reactivities with the compounds
tested are tabulated below:
Compound Concentration % cross-reactivity
(ug/ml)
Amikacin 100 1.55
Kanamycin 100 5.32
No cross-reactivity was detected for the following drugs
(concentrations in ug/ml): chloramphenicol (1000), erythromycin
(1000), tetracycline (1000), sulphamethoxazole (600), trimethoprin
(25), carbenicillin (1000), cephalothin (1000), clindamycin (1000),
gentamicin (25), gentamicin (100), neomycin (100), netilmicin
(100), penicillin G (1000), sisomycin (100), streptomycin (100)
and vancomycin (200).
Sixteen common drugs were tested for interference on the Hitachi
917 in normal human serum pools spiked with tobramycin at 2.5
μg/mL. Sponsor’s acceptance criteria: recovery +/- 10% of the
control value. No significant interference was observed for the
following drugs at the concentrations tested (concentrations in
ug/ml):
acetylcysteine (150) , ampicillin (1000), ascorbic acid (300) , K-
Dobesilate (200), methyldopa (20), Doxycycline (50), cyclosporine
(5), levodopa (20), metronidazole (200), phenylbutazone (400) ,
acetylsalicylic acid (1000) , rifampicin (60), acetaminophen (200),
ibuprofen (500), cefoxitin (2500), and theophylline (100).
To evaluate interference from endogenous compounds, a series of
dilutions containing varying levels of the endogenous compounds
was prepared from spiked pooled serum. Testing was in the
presence of 3 ug/ml tobramycin (except for intralipid, conjugated
and unconjugated bilirubin in which samples contained 7 ug/ml
tobramycin.) Percent recovery was calculated relative to control
samples containing tobramycin without spiked endogenous

b. Matrix comparison:
To evaluate the effect of plasma anticoagulants, comparisons of
serum samples versus samples containing EDTA, sodium heparin,
sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate, citrate, and lithium heparin
were conducted. Thirty samples were included for
fluoride/potassium oxalate and citrate anticoagulants; fifteen
samples were included for EDTA, sodium heparin, and lithium
heparin. No significant bias due to these anticoagulants was
observed.

4. Clinical cut-off:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The therapeutic range for this specific assay was not determined. The
sponsor stated that similar diagnostic technologies have shown that in
most adults, a peak therapeutic response is achieved with tobramycin
concentration ranges of 6-10 μg/mL and trough concentration ranges of
0.5-2.0 μg/mL. The sponsor stated in the package insert that each
laboratory should investigate the transferability of the expected values to
its own patient population and if necessary determine its own reference
range. Test findings should always be assessed in conjunction with
patient's medical history, clinical examination and other medical findings.
The following ranges for peak and trough were taken from the literature
and included in the package insert:
Investigator Peak μg/mL Trough μg/mL
