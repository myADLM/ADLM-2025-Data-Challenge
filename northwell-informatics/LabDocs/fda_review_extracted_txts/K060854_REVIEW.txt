ABX PENTRA HDL Direct CP
The assay is a homogeneous method for directly measuring HDL-C levels in serum or
plasma without the need for any off-line pretreatment or centrifugation steps.
The method is in a two reagent format and depends on the properties of a unique
detergent, as illustrated. This method is based on accelerating the reaction of
cholesterol oxidase (CO) with non-HDL unesterified cholesterol and dissolving HDL
selectively using a specific detergent.
In the first reagent, non-HDL unesterified cholesterol is subject to an enzyme reaction
and the peroxide generated is consumed by a peroxidase reaction with DSBmT yielding
a colorless product.
The second reagent consists of a detergent capable of solubilizing HDL specifically,
cholesterol esterase (CE) and chromagenic coupler to develop color for the quantitative
determination of HDL-C.
ABX PENTRA LDL Direct CP
The assay is an homogeneous method for directly measuring LDL-C levels in serum or
plasma, without the need for any off-line pretreatment or centrifugation steps.
The method is in a two reagent format and depends on the properties of a unique
detergent. This detergent (Reagent 1) solubilizes only the non LDL lipoprotein
particles. The cholesterol released is consumed by cholesterol esterase and cholesterol
oxidase in a non color forming reaction. A second detergent (Reagent 2) solubilizes the
remaining LDL particles and a chromogenic coupler allows for color formation. The
enzyme reaction with LDL-C in the presence of the coupler produces color that is
proportional to the amount of LDL cholesterol present in the sample.
