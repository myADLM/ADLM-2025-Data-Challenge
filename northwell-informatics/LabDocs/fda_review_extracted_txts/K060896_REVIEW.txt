I. Device Description:
The OnTrak TesTcup II and OnSite Cupkit assays are in vitro diagnostic tests
intended for professional use for the qualitative detection of amphetamines (d,l-
amphetamine 1000 ng/mL), benzodiazepines (oxazepamn 200 ng/mL), cocaine
metabolite (benzoylecgonine 300 ng/mL), methamphetamine (d-methamphetamine
500 ng/mL), morphine (morphine 300 ng/mL), morphine 2000 (morphine 2000
ng/mL), PCP (phencyclidine 25 ng/mL), and THC (1 1-nor-A9-THC-9-carboxylic
acid 50 ng/mL) and were previously cleared under k033902. The OnTrak TesTcup II
and OnSite Cupkit product lines have several different types that use varying
combinations of the above drugs of abuse test strips.
This submission (k060896) is for the clearance of methamphetamine (d-
methamphetamine) at a 300 ng/mL cut-off to be packaged with the drugs of abuse test
strips above. The methamphetamine assay with a 300 ng/mL cutoff has exactly the
same antibody and antigen as the previously cleared 500 ng/mL methamphetamine

assay. The label system (polystyrene beads), nitrocellulose membrane, control-line
antibody, and sample pad are also identical between the two. The difference between
the two assays is a slight difference in the typical volume of polystyrene bead labeled
antibody and capture antigen.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were identified by the applicant.
L. Test Principle:
The assays are based on the principle of microparticle capture inhibition. The test
relies on the competition between drug, which may be present in the urine being
tested, and drug conjugate immobilized on a membrane in the test chamber. Urine is
collected directly in the test cup provided. The drug profile card is placed in the
samples by inserting it into the lid holder, then securing the lid onto the cup. Urine is
drawn in the profile card by capillary action and reacts with antibody coated
microparticles and drug conjugate present on the membrane. In the absence of drug,
the antibody is free to interact with the drug conjugate, causing the formation of a
blue band.
When drug is present in the specimen, it binds to the antibody-coated microparticles.
If sufficient drug is present, the microparticles are inhibited from binding the drug
conjugate and no blue band is formed at the result window. A preliminary positive
("non-negative" result is the absence of a blue band).
An additional antibody/antigen reaction occurs at the "VALID" area. The "VALID"
blue band forms when antibodies, which are imbedded in the reagent membrane,
interact with and bind to the antigen on the blue microparticles.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the assay for methamphetamine (300 ng/mL cut-off) was
determined by testing 63 replicates across three different days with 6 different
concentrations: 0, 75, 150, 225, 375, and 450 ng/mL (21 replicates for each
concentration per day, for a total of 378 devices tested) using a
Methamphetamine urine standard containing drug at different concentrations.
Results were read by the three operators. Samples were randomized and blind
with respect to the operators. Results are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor did not indicate any degree of traceability for their devices.
Control materials are required but are not specifically identified in the
labeling. No calibrators are required. The device is calibrated during the
manufacturing process.
d. Detection limit:
Sensitivity of qualitative assays may be characterized by validating
performance around the claimed cutoff concentration of the assay, and
demonstrating the lowest concentration of drug that is capable of or
consistently producing a positive result. This information appears in the
precision section, a., above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Each substance was tested starting with a 100,000 ng/mL solution or a 1000
ng/mL solution in a negative urine control. Each compound was diluted and
tested negative result appeared for methamphetamine. Three OnSite CupKit
devices were tested per substance by pipetting approximately 100 to 200 uL of
spiked urine onto the appropriate feedhole. Devices were color rated
according to the QC color rating scale. If at least 2 out of 3 negative results
were seen for methamphetamine, then the sponsor defines this as no
interference at that level. The entire protocol was repeated for each of the two
lots. Results are summarized below.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The methamphetamine strip within the TesTcup II /CupKit was evaluated in a
SAMHSA certified laboratory using clinical specimens. The clinical negative
samples were screened negative by automated immunoassay and reported as
negatives according to SAMSHA guidelines. Clinical specimens screened
positive by automated immunoassay were subsequently analyzed by GC/MS.
Ten samples were diluted once with negative human urine to achieve the
appropriate test range.
A total of 100 negative urine samples were tested, 10% of these specimens,
chosen at random were confirmed negative by GC/MS. A total of 50 positive
urine samples were tested. 10% of the samples were between 75% and 100%
of the analyte cutoff; another 10% of the samples were between 100% and
125% of the cutoff. The remainders of the samples were at concentrations
greater than 125% of the cutoff. Results are summarized below.
