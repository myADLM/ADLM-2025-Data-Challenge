L. Test Principle:
ARCHITECT BNP Assay is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative
determination of human B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in human EDTA plasma
using CMIA technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex®. In
the first step, sample and anti-BNP coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined.
BNP present in the sample binds to the anti-BNP coated microparticles. After
washing, anti-BNP acridium-labeled conjugate is added to create a reaction mixture
in the second step. Following another wash cycle, pre-trigger and trigger solutions
are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is
measured as relative light units (RLU’s). A direct relationship exists between the
amount of BNO in the sample and the RLU’s detected by the ARCHITECT I System
optics.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The study was conducted according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) Protocol EP5-A2. A three member panel was assayed in
replicates of two at two separate times of the day for 20 days (n = 80 for each
panel member). Testing was performed on two ARCHITECT Systems using a
single calibration on each instrument. Within run CV(%) ranged from 0.9 to
5.6 %. Total CV(%) ranged from 1.7 to 6.7 %.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Aliquots of 5 EDTA plasma pools were augmented by the addition of BNP
antigen to concentrations within the assay dynamic range. These plasma
samples were diluted with normal plasma (BNP concentration < 10 pg/mL)
containing protease inhibitors. The undiluted and diluted samples were tested
in replicates of two using the ARCHITECT BNP assay. The range of average
recoveries for the samples assayed using the routine protocol for the
ARCHITECT BNP assay was 91.1% to 112.2% for dilutions to 1:30. The
range of average recoveries for the samples assayed using the STAT protocol
for the ARCHITECT BNP assay was 91.2% to 96.9% for dilutions to 1:30.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ARCHITECT BNP Calibrators are traceable to an internal reference
standard that has been prepared gravimetrically with synthetic BNP. The
internal reference standard underwent a one-time value assignment to align
with the AxSYM BNP assay with a decision threshold of 100 pg/mL.
Stability studies were performed to evaluate the intended storage (open and
closed vial) for the ARCHITECT BNP Calibrators and Controls. The data
support a closed vial shelf life of 9 months for the calibrators and controls.
A study was conducted to evaluate the open vial stability of the ARCHITECT
BNP Calibrator Kits and ARCHITECT BNP Control Kits when all bottled
components are manually opened and closed. The study was performed to
support the package insert claim instructing the end user to tightly close the
caps on the bottles after each use and return to 2-8oC storage. Three lots each
of the ARCHITECT BNP Calibrator Kits and ARCHITECT BNP Control
Kits were evaluated during this study. At time zero, all of the bottles set aside
for this study were opened and closed and stored at 2-8oC continuously. One
of the kit lots for each product (one lot of the ARCHITECT BNP Calibrator
Kit and one lot of the ARCHITECT BNP Control Kit) was stored inverted.
Each of the three lots of ARCHITECT BNP Calibrators and Controls were
tested monthly following the Time Zero test point. This study supports a shelf
life of 9 months and verifies the package insert instructions for the
ARCHITECT BNP Calibrator Kits and ARCHITECT BNP Control Kits

d. Detection limit:
A study was conducted to determine the lowest measurable BNP
concentration that can be distinguished from zero for the ARCHITECT BNP
assay. The acceptance criterion for the analytical sensitivity (Limit of
Detection or LOD) for the ARCHITECT BNP assay is < 10 pg/mL. The
Minimal Detectable Dose (MDD) of the ARCHITECT BNP assay was
determined by testing ARCHITECT BNP Calibrator A (0 pg/mL) in replicates
of 10 followed by two replicates of ARCHITECT BNP Calibrator B (75
pg/mL), on each of three instruments (two instruments were run using the
STAT assay protocol and one instrument was run using the Routine assay
protocol), using two lots of reagents and two lots of calibrators (n = 18 runs).
The mean values and the standard deviations of the 18 sets of A Calibrators
and the mean values of the 18 sets of B Calibrators were used to determine the
MDD for each run. Analytical sensitivity (Limit of Detection or LOD) is
defined as the concentration at two standard deviations (SD) above the mean
MDD, and represents the lowest measurable concentration of analyte that can
be distinguished from zero. The Analytical Sensitivity (LOD) of the
ARCHITECT BNP assay was calculated to be 3.8 pg/mL, which meets the
acceptance criteria, and supports the package insert claim for sensitivity of
10.0 pg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The ARCHITECT BNP assay was evaluated for analytical specificity in a
study where cross-reactivity with human ANP, Angiotensin I, II, and III,
CNP, and NT-proBNP was measured by the assay. Each potential cross
reactant was added to protease-inhibitor treated plasma and then assayed.
Cross-reactant
Concentration %
Cross-reactant (pg/mL) % Cross-reactivity
ANP 1000 <10
Angiotensin I 600 <10
Angiotensin II 600 <10
Angiotensin III 1000 <10
CNP 1000 <10
NT-proBNP (47-76) 1000 <10
The ARCHITECT BNP assay demonstrated an average interference < 10%
(for each compound) in a study based upon guidance from CLSI Protocol
EP7-A.
Specimens were supplemented with various drugs and potentially interfering
compounds (bilirubin, hemoglobin, total protein, and triglycerides) at the
levels indicated in the following table.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The information from the clinical study performed with the AxSYM BNP
Assay is provided in the labeling for the ARCHITECT I BNP Assay. A new
clinical study was not performed since the capture and conjugate antibodies
are the same. In studies performed with the AxSYM BNP Assay, age-matched
analysis of the heart failure and non-heart failure populations was performed
based on the data published by the American Heart Association in the 2000
Heart and Stroke Statistical Update and according to the age structure of the
United States population. The age distributions in the intended use population
are approximately as follows: individuals less than 45 years old comprise
9%,individuals 45-54 years old comprise 11%, individuals 55-64 years old
comprise 22%, individuals 65-74 years old comprise 26%, and individuals 75
years and older comprise 32%. The resulting combined AUC is 0.87 (0.85 to
0.90, 95%CI). The clinical sensitivity and specificity using a decision
threshold of 100 pg/mL is presented in the table below.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Data from the clinical studies performed with the AxSYM BNP assay were used
to generate The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of BNP decision
thresholds versus clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity. At a decision
threshold of 100 pg/mL, the BNP assay demonstrated a clinical sensitivity and
specificity of 74.2% and 91.5% respectively. The area under the curve is 0.90
(0.86 to 0.92, 95% CI).
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Plasma samples from 890 individuals (465 females, 425 males) who had not been
diagnosed with heart failure were tested with the AxSYM BNP assay. This
population included non-hospitalized patients with renal disease (not on dialysis),
diabetes, hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. BNP levels for
these patients were not statistically different from the population of apparently
healthy individuals. The data are summarized below.

Plasma samples from 693 patients with diagnosed heart failure (231 females, 462
males) were tested with the AxSYM BNP assay. All patients in this population
were categorized according to the functional classification system published by
the New York Heart Association (NYHA). This system divides heart failure
patients into one of four categories of increasing disease progression (classes I to
IV) based upon a subjective assessment of the patient’s clinical signs and
symptoms.The data from this study are summarized below.
