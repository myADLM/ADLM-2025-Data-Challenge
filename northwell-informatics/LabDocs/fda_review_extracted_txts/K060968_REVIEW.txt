L. Test Principle:
Stasis 1 (Normal), Stasis 2 (Moderate Abnormal), and Stasis 3 (High Abnormal):
The use of quality controls is essential for assuring quality in coagulation testing. Stasis 3
and a normal control, such as Stasis 1, are an integral part of a complete quality assurance
program.
Serathan-A and Serathan-B reagents: The PT is used as a screen and quantitative test
for coagulation factors in the extrinsic and common pathways. Patients with acquired or
congenital disorders that reduce the activities of Fibrinogen and Factors II, V, VII, and X
will be prolonged in this test. The PT is used to monitor oral anticoagulation therapy. The
one step PT measures the clotting time of plasma after adding a source thromboplastin
and calcium. The recalcification of plasma with thromboplastin generates activated FXa.
FXa in turn activates Prothrombin, which converts fibrinogen to an insoluble fibrin clot.
Intrin-EA and Intrin-SI reagents: The APTT is an established tool as a quantitative test
for the intrinsic coagulation factors. It is a simple versatile test which is sensitive to
functional deficiencies of factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII. The APTT is performed by
adding reagent containing a plasma activator and phospholipid to the test specimen.
Thrombin Control Normal and Low, Thrombin Reagent: The thrombin clotting time
fibrinogen assay is based on the method described by Clauss. 1 In the presence
of high concentrations of thrombin, the time required for clot formation in dilute plasma
is inversely proportional to the fibrinogen concentrations.
Heparin Control Plasma Level 1 and 2: The anticoagulant heparin is used in the
treatment of various thrombosis disorders, and for the prevention of thrombin formation
during surgery. There are a number of assays available for the clinical laboratory to
monitor heparin therapy. A critical component in these assays is the use of quality control
plasmas.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Stasis 1 Control is formulated to have PT, APTT, and Fibrinogen values in
the normal range. The reproducibility of three lot of the control, a run-run
(n=180) singlicate assays, produced a coefficient of variations of < 1% for the
PT, < 1% for the APTT, and < 1% for Fibrinogen assays. This study was
performed on the BBL Fibrometer.
Stasis 2 Control is formulated to have PT, APTT values in the moderate
abnormal range. The reproducibility of three lots of the control, a run-run
(n=180) singlicate assays, produced a coefficient of variations of < 1% for the
10

--- Page 11 ---
PT, < 1.5% for the APTT assays. This study was performed on the BBL
Fibrometer.
Stasis 3 Control is formulated to have PT, APTT values in the strongly
abnormal range. The reproducibility of three lots of the control, a run-run
(n=180) singlicate assays, produced a coefficient of variations of < 1% for the
PT, < 1.6% for the APTT assays. This study was performed on the BBL
Fibrometer.
Serathan-A and Serathan-B: Both reagents were assayed by testing the
reagent against three lots each of normal and abnormal control plasma, in
singlicate assays, on the BBL Fibrometer. A summary of the results follow:

Heparin Control Level 1 Plasma as abnormal APTT control, within-run
precision studies performed on the BBL Fibrometer using Intrin-SI reagent
yielded CV’s of 1.82 %, and a 1.77% CV for run-run assays.
Heparin Control Level 2 Plasma as abnormal APTT control, within-run
precision studies performed on the BBL Fibrometer using Intrin-SI reagent
yielded CV’s of 1.92 %, and a 1.81% CV for run-run assays.
Thrombin Reagent: Precision of the Normal and Low Fibrinogen Control
result is dependent on many factors, such as the instrument, technique and the
reagent used. A 1:6 and 1:8 dilutions of 3 lots of the Normal and Low
Fibrinogen Control respectively, were made and assayed in singlicate on the
BBL Fibrometer. A summary of the results follow:
Control n within-run n run-run
Normal 60 0.56% CV 180 0.57% CV
Low 60 0.60% CV 180 0.58% CV

Serathan-B reagents Reportable Range/Linearity: A linearity study,
assayed on the BBL Fibrometer, to measure warfarin in 18 plasma samples of
0-5 U/ml, yielded a linearity range of 11.6 –36.2 seconds.
Intrin-EA A Reportable Range/Linearity: linearity study, assayed on the
BBL Fibrometer, of Intrin-EA to measure heparin in 18 plasma samples of 0-5
U/ml, yielded a linearity range of 29.0 –70.7 seconds.
Intrin-SI Reportable Range/Linearity: A linearity study, assayed on the
BBL Fibrometer, of Intrin-SI to measure heparin in18 plasma samples of 0-5

Fibrinogen Control Low
Three lots were evaluated in singlicate on the BBL Fibrometer (n=180), the
run-run mean fibrinogen level of 99 mg/dl and a ± 2SD range of 98-100
mg/dl. Actual values recovered depend on the instrument and reagent used.
Fibrinogen Control Normal
Three lots were evaluated in singlicate on the BBL Fibrometer (n=180), the
run-run mean fibrinogen level was 301 mg/dl and at ± 2SD range of 300-302
mg/dl Actual values recovered depend on the instrument and reagent used.
Heparin Control Plasma Level 1 was assayed on the BBL Fibrometer
produced a mean APTT clotting time of 46.9 seconds and a ± 2SD range of
45.1-48.7 seconds.
Heparin Control Plasma Level 2 was assayed on the BBL Fibrometer
produced a mean APTT clotting time of 63.5 seconds and a ± 2SD range of
61.2-65.8 seconds.
