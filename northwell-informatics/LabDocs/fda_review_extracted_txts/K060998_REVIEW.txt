L. Test Principle:
The QMS Tobramycin assay is a homogeneous particle-enhanced turbidimetric
immunoassay. The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample and
drug coated onto a microparticle for antibody binding sites of the tobramycin
antibody reagent. The tobramycin-coated microparticle reagent (R2) is rapidly
agglutinated in the presence of the anti-tobramycin antibody reagent (R1) and in the
absence of any competing drug in the sample. The rate of absorbance change is
measured photometrically and is inversely proportional to the rate of agglutination of
the particles. When a sample containing tobramycin is added, the agglutination
reaction is partially inhibited, slowing down the rate of absorbance change. A
concentration-dependent agglutination inhibition curve can be obtained with
maximum rate of agglutination at the lowest tobramycin concentration and the lowest
agglutination rate at the highest tobramycin concentration.

Precision was conducted and assessed according to NCCLS EP5-A2.Three
commercially available control materials (Low Control, Mid Control, and
High Control) were evaluated on the Hitachi 917 and, after 2 hours within the
same day, the samples were re-run in duplicate, over 20 days resulting in a
total of 80 replicates for each control. Calibration was performed initially and
re-calibration was performed when the controls did not recover within labeled
ranges. The results for the precision study are presented below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range of the assay is 0.4 – 10 μg/mL.
Linearity was assessed by following the CLSI EP6-A guideline. A stock
solution of approximately 17 ug/mL tobramycin in a human serum pool was
diluted with human serum negative for tobramycin to achieve samples across
and above the reportable range of the assay (0.4-10 ug/mL). These samples
were run in triplicate and the percent recovery for each sample was
determined by dividing the mean observed result by the theoretical value. The
results were evaluated by linear regression. The results are summarized below.

The sponsor evaluated the performance of the QMS diluent CAL A (0 ug/mL)
by comparing the results of diluted samples with neat patient samples.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The QMS Tobramycin assay does not include controls or calibrators.
Calibrators were cleared under k872349. The sponsor is the current owner
and manufacturer of the Innofluor line and continues to manufacture the
calibrators using the same validated procedures established at the time of
clearance for k872349.
The sponsor performed real time stability studies to establish the 12 month
shelf life claim and the 45 days on board reagent claim. Real time studies for
extending the shelf life are ongoing. The protocol for establishing stability
was reviewed and found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity (Limit of the Blank) claim of 0.17 ug/mL is defined
by the sponsor as the lowest concentration of analyte detectable from zero
with 95% confidence when performing the assay.

statistics: y = 0.98x – 0.09; r = 0.992
b. Matrix comparison:
A study was conducted to determine the performance of the assay for serum
and plasma samples containing tobramycin.
Blood was drawn from ten healthy donors (with no tobramycin therapy) for
each tube type listed below:
• Plastic K2 EDTA tube
• Glass K3 EDTA tube
• Glass plasma separator lithium heparin tube
• Glass sodium heparin tube
• Glass lithium heparin tube
• Glass serum separator tube
• Plastic tube with clot activator
• Glass tube with no additives
• Plastic tube with no additives.
The serum or plasma was removed from the collection tubes and aliquoted
into new tubes for testing (using the same procedure the customer would
follow). Serum or plasma from each tube was spiked with tobramycin
obtained from a supplier. These samples were analyzed on the Hitachi 917
analyzer in duplicate with baseline results obtained on day zero for each type
of tube. The results showed there were no interferences with regard to the
recovery of tobramycin in serum or plasma for the nine tube types tested.

have been reported for serious bacterial infections. A therapeutic range of 2 to 8
ug/mL has been suggested for tobramycin. Due to great individual differences in
dosage requirements to achieve efficacious therapy as well as reported adverse
effects at concentrations of 5 to 8 ug/mL, determination of tobramycin serum
concentrations is required to optimize therapeutic drug management.
