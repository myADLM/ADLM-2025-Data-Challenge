L. Test Principle:
COULTER® LIN-C linearity controls are made to verify the reportable range of
Beckman Coulter hematology systems. To ensure the accuracy of linearity control
ranges, Beckman Coulter systems are calibrated with S-CAL calibrator and
maintained according to the appropriate Product Manual or Online Help System.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not Applicable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Closed vial stability was performed using 20 lots of the additional levels of
LIN-C Linearity Control. These lots were tested 3 times per month. Six
aspirations per level from one new closed vial were performed at each test
point (12-120 days).
Open vial stability was performed using 20 lots of the additional levels of
LIN-C Linearity Control. These lots were tested monthly. Two vials per level
were evaluated at each time point (12-120 days). A single aspiration was
performed on Day 1 to initiate the open vial condition followed by six
aspirations on Day 7 to validate open vial claim of 7 days.
Assigned Values for Levels 6-9 are confirmed by multiple analysis of the
control product. For Level 0, since it does not contain any cellular
components, a fixed acceptable recovery range (low and high limits) was
developed by Beckman Coulter which will be applied and verified on each lot
manufactured.
d. Detection limit:
Not Applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Not Applicable.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not Applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not Applicable.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not Applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not Applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not Applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not Applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Expected ranges were calculated by Beckman Coulter based on data collected on
validated systems using specific Beckman Coulter reagents and are included with
each kit. Mean values should recover within the ranges. The ranges established by
Beckman Coulter should be used as a guideline. Each laboratory must establish its
own criteria for acceptable results.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
