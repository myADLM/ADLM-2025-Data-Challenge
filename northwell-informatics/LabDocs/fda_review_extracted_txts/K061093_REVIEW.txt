3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
In this submission, the Cholinesterase Gen.2 test system is being applied to the
previously cleared COBAS INTEGRA family of analyzers including the COBAS

I. Device Description:
The Cholinesterase Gen.2 Test System is an in vitro test for the quantitative
determination of the catalytic activity of cholinesterase in serum and plasma. The test
consists of two ready-to-use liquid reagents. The calibrator is the Calibrator for
automated systems (C.f.a.s) that was cleared under k033501. The recommended control
materials are Precinorm U or Precinorm U Plus; and Precipath U or Precipath U plus
which were cleared under k041227 and k042389 respectively. In this submission the
reagents are being applied to the COBAS INTEGRA 400, 400 plus, 700 and 800
analyzers.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
k951595 - Cholinesterase test system on the
Predicate
Integra Analyzer
Similarites
Both the Cholinesterase and the Cholinesterase Gen.2 test systems are intended for the in vitro
quantitative determination of the catalytic activity of cholinesterase in serum and plasma.
Both test systems are run on the COBAS INTEGRA family of analyzers.
The test principles are similar; both rely on spectrophotmetric determination of reaction product
after cholinesterase hydrolyzes a butrylthiocholine derivative.
Differences
Cholinesterase Gen.2 test system measures the decrease in color while the predicate device measures
an increase in color.
The reagents for the new test system are provided in liquid ready-to-use format while the predicate
device test system reagents require reconstitution
There are slight differences in reagent stability, measuring range, and limit of detection.

L. Test Principle:
The Cholinesterase Gen.2 Test System is an in vitro test for the quantitative
determination of the catalytic activity of cholinesterase in serum and plasma. The test is
based on the butyrylthiocholine method. Cholinesterase catalyzes the hydrolysis of
butyrylthiocholine to thiocoline and butyrate. Thiocholine reduces the yellow substrate
hexacyanoferrate III to the almost colorless hexacyanoferrate II. The decrease in color is
measured spectrophotometrically.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run (n=21) and between-day precision was conducted for the
Cholinesterase Gen.2 test system using two controls and two human serum
pools on the Integra 800 Analyzer. The between-day precision samples were
run in triplicate and the second of the three results were used for the precision
determination. The precision summaries are listed in the tables below.

The sponsor conducted two serial dilution linearity studies for the
Cholinesterase Gen.2 test system on the Integra 800 analyzer. The samples
were prepared by spiking a saline solution with pure cholinesterase from
human plasma and diluting with saline. One study measured samples ranging
from 404 – 4801 U/L (theoretical spiked concentration). The second study
measured samples ranging from 2762 – 27621 U/L(theoretical spiked
concentration). All samples were recovered within +/- 10% of the theoretical
concentration. The extended measuring range from 14000 to 28000 (based on
post dilution factor of 2) was was also validated in the second set of samples.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrators and controls for use with this device have been previously
cleared. Their composition has not been modified for use with the
Cholinesterase Gen.2 test system. The calibrators and controls are
standardized against and traceable to a reference method using a manual
application of the butyrlthiocholine/ hexacyanoferrate (III) method on a
photometer and the published molar absorptivity of hexacyanoferrate (III)
Stability studies for the device were described. Studies supported the
sponsor’s 4-week on-board stability claim. The sponsor also described real-
time and an accelerated studies to support the 15 month closed stability claim.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical sensitivity (Limit of Blank) was defined as the concentration at
three standard deviations above the mean of repeated measurements (N=21) of
the zero calibrator. The mean + (3xSD) was calculated to be 122.8 U/L. The
sponsor claims a lower detection limit of 200 U/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Human serum pools that contained 5817 – 9143 U/L cholinesterase was
evaluated for endogenous interference by the Cholinesterase Gen.2 test
system. The sponsor defined interference as percent recovery that exceeded
+/- 10% of the expected 100% recovery. Human serum pools that contained
approximately 4700 U/L cholinesterase were tested by the Cholinesterase
Gen.2 test system for drug interference. The sponsor defined drug
interference as results that deviated more than 10% from the reference value.
A list of compounds tested can be found in the device labeling. There was no
interference (<10%) from the 18 drug pharmaceuticals tested and also from
the following substances:
Hemoglobin up to 347 mg/dL,
