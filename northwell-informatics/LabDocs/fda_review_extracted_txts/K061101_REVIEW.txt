L. Test Principle:
The test kit uses viral antigen-specific murine monoclonal antibodies that are directly
labeled with fluorescein, for rapid detection and identification of respiratory viruses.
The cells to be tested, either derived from a clinical specimen or cell culture, are fixed
in acetone. The DFA Screening Reagent is added to the cells to determine the
presence of viral antigens. After incubating at 35ºC to 37ºC, the stained cells are
rinsed with the diluted Wash Solution, a drop of the supplied Mounting Fluid is added
and a coverslip is placed on the prepared cells. The cells are examined using a
fluorescence microscope. Virus infected cells will be stained with viral specific
apple-green fluorescence when stained with the DFA Screening Reagent while
uninfected cells will contain no fluorescence but will be stained red by the Evan’s
Blue counter-stain. If on examination of a direct stained specimen, no fluorescent-
stained cells are found and all the cells stain red from the Evan’s Blue, it is
recommended that the specimen be cultured and stained using the DFA Screening
Reagent.
If fluorescent cells are seen, the particular virus is identified using the separate DFA
Reagents on new, separate cell preparations. Cell preparations are fixed in acetone.
The individual virus DFA Reagents are added to the cell preparations. After
incubating at 35º to 37ºC, the stained cells are rinsed with the diluted Wash Solution,
a drop of the supplied Mounting Fluid is added and a coverslip is placed on the
stained cells. The cells are examined using a fluorescence microscope for the
presence of viral specific apple-green fluorescence, by which the unknown
respiratory virus is identified.
Interpretation of results:
It is recommended that controls be examined first to ensure proper test performance
before examination of the specimens. A positive reaction is one in which bright
apple-green fluorescence is observed in the infected cells. Uninfected cells will stain
dull red due to the Evan’s Blue counter-stain included in the DFA Reagent.

Fluorescent staining pattern of respiratory virus infected cells:
The “typical” apple-green fluorescence staining pattern for each virus is as follows:
Influenza A and B: The fluorescence is cytoplasmic, nuclear or both. Cytoplasmic
staining is often punctate with large inclusions while nuclear staining is uniformly
bright.
Respiratory Syncytial Virus: The fluorescence is cytoplasmic and punctate with small
inclusions in the syncytia.
Adenovirus: The fluorescence is cytoplasmic and punctate or bright nuclear or both.
Parainfluenza 1, 2, 3: The fluorescence is cytoplasmic and punctate with irregular
inclusions. Types 2 and 3 cause the formation of syncytia.
Co-infection with more than one infecting virus present in the specimen has been
reported in a number of studies. The presence of multiple viruses is indicated when
more than one well of the 8-well slide has fluorescent cells. The identification of the
viruses is based on the individual virus DFA Reagents showing fluorescence. In such
a case, it should be reported as “… and … detected by direct specimen testing.” or
“… and … isolated by cell culture.”
Results from direct specimen testing: The quality of the specimen with respect to the
number of epithelial cells in the sample can be assessed by examining the different
fields at a magnification of 200X. A satisfactory specimen should have at least 2
columnar epithelial cells per field. A negative result is indicated by the absence of
fluorescence in a minimal sampling of 20 columnar epithelial cells. An inadequate
sample is indicated by fewer than 20 columnar epithelial cells present in the sample,
in which case the test is considered invalid. A new specimen should be obtained and
tested or cell culture of the remaining specimen should be initiated.
A satisfactory specimen with no fluorescent cells found should be reported as
“Presumptively negative, no Influenza A, Influenza B, Adenovirus, Respiratory
Syncytial Virus, Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza 2, or Parainfluenza 3 detected by
direct specimen testing”. However, such negative results should be confirmed using
cell culture. In the case culture yields a positive result, it should be reported as “…
isolated by cell culture”, where ‘…’ is the appropriate virus.
If fluorescent cells are found, continue with the Testing Procedure, staining with the
individual virus DFA Reagents. The individual virus DFA Reagent that yields
fluorescent cells represents the identification of the respiratory virus. In such a case,
it should be reported as “… detected by direct specimen testing”, where ‘…’ is the
appropriate virus, e.g. Influenza A, Influenza B, Adenovirus, Respiratory Syncytial
Virus, Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza 2, or Parainfluenza 3.
Results from Culture Isolation / Confirmation: The entire cell spot or monolayer of
cells must be examined for virus-infected, fluorescent cells. If no fluorescent cells
are found, the results of testing of the specimen should be reported as, “No Influenza
A, Influenza B, Adenovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Parainfluenza 1,
Parainfluenza 2, or Parainfluenza 3 isolated by cell culture.”

d. Detection limit:
The Predicate and Subject MAbs were compared by inoculating 96-well cell
culture plates with the appropriate virus stock diluted to give ~ 50 viral
particles for the entire plate or 1 viral particle per every 2 wells (i.e. 1
TCID50). The plates were incubated at 37° C for 24 hours and then stained
with either the Subject Kit or the Predicate D Kit. All plates were stained
using the procedure in the product insert. This assay was performed 3 times
with each virus and the results indicate no statistical difference from the
Predicate kit by a paired t-test.
Each targeted respiratory virus was diluted to a value of 250 virus/mL and
serial 2-fold dilutions were then done down to a final value of 0.49 virus/mL.
Each dilution of virus was inoculated into 6 shell vials of R-Mix, centrifuged
at 700xg for 60 minutes and incubated at 35-37oC for 48 hours. The Subject
Kit or the Predicate Kit was used to stain 3 shell vials of each viral dilution
according to the product insert. The sensitivity of both fluorescent antibody
stains is equivalent, with ~ 0.5 – 1.0 PFU as the minimum viral dilution
detected.
In order to determine if mixing the 15 various MAbs in the screening reagent
affected their sensitivity, the analytical sensitivity of the subject screen
reagent was compared to that of the subject individual reagents by inoculating
96-well cell culture plates with the appropriate virus stock diluted to give ~ 50
viral particles for the entire plate or 1 viral particle per every 2 wells. The
plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours and then stained with either the
subject screening reagent or the subject individual reagents. All plates were
stained using the procedure in the product insert. This assay was performed 3
times with each virus and the results indicate that the sensitivity of the
screening reagent in the subject kit was not statistically different from that of
the subject individual reagents using the paired test.
Analytical specificity:
The DFA Reagents were tested for cross-reactivity against a wide variety of
cells and microorganisms. No cross-reactivity was observed for 64 virus
strains (cultured and processed for staining) or for 18 host culture cell types.
Eighteen (18) bacterial cultures were stained and examined for cross-
reactivity, including Staphylococcus aureus, a protein-A-producing bacterium.
Staining of S. aureus appeared as small points of fluorescence while all other
6

--- Page 7 ---
bacterial cultures were negative. [Protein A will nonspecifically bind to the Fc
portions of conjugated antibodies. Such binding can be distinguished from
viral antigen binding on the basis of morphology, i.e., S. aureus-bound
fluorescence appears as small (~1 micron diameter), bright dots.
Stringent conditions for cross-reactivity testing were achieved by using high
concentration DFAs and high titers of microorganisms. The DFAs (i.e.
directly fluoresceinated monoclonal antibodies) were prepared at 1.5X the
concentration that is provided in the kit. Each of the tested viruses was
prepared as infected cell monolayers (250 infected cells inoculated into a shell
vial culture and incubated for 24 to 48 hours, to yield a 3+ to 4+ infection),
and processed and stained with the 1.5X DFAs according to the procedure
detailed in the product insert. Bacterial strains were cultured, processed as
suspensions, then spotted on microscope slides (yielding > 150 bacteria per
400X microscope field), then stained with the 1.5X DFAs according to the
procedure in the product insert. Cell cultures were stained as confluent
monolayers.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The study included 849 original specimens evaluated by this product
(“Subject” test) and a currently marketed DFA Screening & Identification Kit
(“Predicate” test). All 849 specimens were studied by Direct Specimen (DS)
testing with 22 of these specimens having insufficient cell numbers to be
evaluated, and one other which could not be evaluated because it exhibited
non-specific staining from the Normal Mouse Gamma Globulin DFA
Reagent; 520 of the specimens also were studied by Cell Culture (CC) method
with one specimen not evaluated because it produced a toxic cell culture
monolayer. All but 30 of the specimens were prospectively collected during
the 2005-2006 season; those 30 specimens had been archived as
Parainfluenza-positive. In addition, a set of 81 clinical isolates were tested by
CC methods only. The evaluations were conducted at three laboratory sites.
Summary of results are shown in tables below:

Specimens and culture isolates used in these studies came from
nasopharyngeal (NP) aspirates, washes, swabs, bronchial alveolar lavages
(BAL) and/or tracheal aspirates.
Percent agreement between the Subject and Predicate tests was calculated for
prospectively collected specimens. For the DFA Screening Reagent:
- By DS method using fresh specimens, positive percent agreement is 95.5%
and negative percent agreement is 98.3% (see Table above), with overall
percent agreement 98.8%. By DS method using frozen specimens, both
positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement are 100% (see
Table above).
- By CC method using frozen specimens, both positive percent agreement and
negative percent agreement are 100% (see Table above).

obtained from an additional laboratory, and were tested in an internal reference
laboratory using the Subject and Predicate Tests by Direct Specimen method
(Study 3a-DS; see table below). The same specimens were tested by Cell Culture
method (Study 3a-CC, see table below). Original results reported by the
laboratory were unknown to the study investigator. Although the study design has
a selection bias, this study offers further analytical information on the assay's
ability to detect Parainfluenza viruses.

Non-prospective archival clinical isolates: A study was conducted using a
collection of banked clinical isolates known to contain respiratory viruses that had
been frozen from the 2005/2006 respiratory season. These specimens were
selected because they were previously shown to contain at least one of the seven
virus analytes detected by the Subject Test.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Respiratory virus infections are often seasonal, with Influenza typically extending
from November to April in the northern hemisphere, and Adenovirus infections
occurring more often during late winter to early summer. RSV is usually a
seasonal (winter and early spring) infection as well, with epidemics lasting up to 5
months, while outbreaks caused by parainfluenza viruses may occur throughout a
year.
The clinical studies were comprised of respiratory specimens collected during the
winter to early spring months of 2005/2006. Prevalence of the respiratory viruses
within the population of specimens that were prospectively collected and tested
fresh are noted in the table below:
