Class I, reserved
3. Product code:
JJY, Multi-analyte controls, all kinds (assayed and unassayed)
4. Panel:
Chemistry (75)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
For in vitro diagnostic use to monitor the precision and the accuracy of the
assayed, quantitative complexed PSA assays on the ADVIA® IMS and Bayer
Immuno1® systems.
2. Indication(s) for use:
For in vitro diagnostic use to monitor the precision and the accuracy of the
assayed, quantitative complexed PSA assays on the ADVIA® IMS and Bayer
Immuno1® systems.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
ADVIA® IMS system and Bayer Immuno1® system
I. Device Description:
The Bayer ADVIA® IMS cPSA Controls are bovine serum based with non-serum
constituents added. The analyte in the control material is cPSA. The cPSA control
kit consists of three different levels of control materials. Level 1 control is
manufactured to a clinically significant decision point, between normal and patient
groups. Level 3 control is manufactured to the upper analytical range of the assay.
Level 2 control is manufactured to a level in between Level 1 and Level 3 controls.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):

L. Test Principle:
Not applicable.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ADVIA IMS cPSA controls are traceable to Stanford University PSA
reference material. This standard consists of 90% purified PSA-α -
1
antichymotrypsin (ACT) and 10% free PSA (90:10) mixture on a molar basis.
Value assignment of production lots is done by a nested study that uses a
Master Lot of product traceable to the Stanford PSA standard.
Unopened controls are stable when stored at <= -10ºC in a non frost-free
freezer, until the expiration date on the label. Opened controls are stable for
35 days, when stored at 2-8ºC.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Not applicable.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Not applicable
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
