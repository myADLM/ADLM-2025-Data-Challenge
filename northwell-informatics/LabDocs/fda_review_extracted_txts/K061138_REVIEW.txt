When an antigen-antibody reaction occurs between CRP in a sample and anti-CRP
antibody which has been sensitized to latex particles, agglutination results. This
agglutination is detected as an absorbance change, with the magnitude of the change
being proportional to the quantity of CRP in the sample. The actual concentration is
then determined by interpolation from a calibration curve prepared from calibrators of
known concentration.

Post-dilution Study
A post-dilution (factor = 1/5) will be initiated in cases of sample concentration
above 160 mg/l. For the samples tested the relative bias was lower than +/-
10% over the range tested (160 – 726 mg/l).
Hook effect
No high dose hook effect was observed up to a concentration of 200 mg/l. A
“Reaction Limit” alarm is calculated to flag samples which have an initial
reaction speed higher than the highest calibrator point (160 mg/l). In these
cases a post-dilution will be preformed.

Open stability: 4 weeks at 2-10°C
Based on real time stability studies
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit of this device (the lower range of measurement) was
determined to be 1.0 mg/l.
e. Analytical specificity:
Hemoglobin up to 485 mg/dl, total bilirubin up to 16.9 mg/dl, direct bilirubin
up to18.8 mg/dl, and triglycerides (as Intralipid ®, representative of lipemia)
up to 612.5 mg/dl do not interfere with CRP determination by this test.
Study method:
The above substances were added to the base serum at two different CRP
concentration (approx 8.6 mg/l and 27.36 mg/L). The base serum with each
substance was then serially diluted with the same base serum that was added
saline instead of substance to adjust CRP concentration. The acceptance limit
for non-interference was to be with-in 10% of the mean value of each level.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
190 patient samples (serum) were tested with the device and a commercial
reagent according to the recommendations found in the CLSI (NCCLS), EP9-
A2 protocol.
Values ranged from 0.13 to 158.30 mg/l.
