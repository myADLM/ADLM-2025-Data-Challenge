JIT, Calibrator, Secondary
4. Panel:
Chemistry (75)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
ADVIA® IMS PSA Calibrator: For in vitro diagnostic use in the calibration of
quantitative PSA assays on the ADVIA® IMS system.
ADVIA® IMS cPSA Calibrator: For in vitro diagnostic use in the calibration of
quantitative complexed PSA assays on the ADVIA® IMS system.

I. Device Description:
The Bayer ADVIA® IMS PSA Calibrator and ADVIA® IMS cPSA Calibrators are
prepared in bovine serum with non-serum constituents added. There are six PSA
levels each for the ADVIA® IMS PSA and cPSA Calibrators. The levels for PSA
Calibrator are 0, 2, 10, 25, 50 and 100 ng/mL. The cPSA Calibrator values are
assigned to specific lots and are not assigned specific values.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Lipoprotein Calibrator
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
