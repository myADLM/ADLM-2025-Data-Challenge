M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
1. Within-run precision was determined by using samples that were run in the
open mode ten times consecutively. Conclusion: The average CV% results for
WBC samples ≥0.05 x 103/µL and for RBC samples ≥0.01 x 106/µL were
acceptable.
2. Between-day precision using e-Check was monitored for the time period of
the evaluation. Results were within acceptable ranges for e-Check as stated in
the manufacturer’s specifications.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
WBC and RBC linearity were evaluated by diluting body fluid samples with
instrument diluent to obtain results at low levels of detection. R squared
values for WBCs ranged from 0.9974 to 1.0. R squared values for RBCs
ranged from 0.9655 to 0.9990. Conclusion: The WBC and RBC parameters
were linear at low levels for body fluid specimens.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
N/A
d. Detection limit:

e. Analytical specificity:

f. Assay cut-off:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Due to the unavailability of obtaining normal body fluid samples, it is difficult for
laboratories to establish expected values: therefore all laboratories will reference
textbook values as their expected values as was the case with these study sites.
Table 5: Adult Expected Values for Body Fluids
Body Fluid Type WBC RBC
CSF <5 mononuclear cells/µL NA
Peritoneal fluid <500/mL NA
Pleural fluid NA (WBCs have limited value) NA
Synovial fluid <200/µL NA
SOURCE: Kjelksberg C. and Knight J. Body Fluids: Laboratory

N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
a substantial equivalence decision.
