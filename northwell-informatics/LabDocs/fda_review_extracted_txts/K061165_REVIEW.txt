Medical Devices”
L. Test Principle:
The EliA CCP Wells are coated with citrullinated synthetic peptides. If present in the
patient’s specimen, antibodies to CCP bind to their specific antigen. After washing
away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgG antibodies
(EliA IgG Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After
incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away and the bound complex is incubated
with a Development Solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the
reaction mixture is measured. The higher the response value, the more specific IgG is
present in the specimen. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is
compared directly to the response for calibrators.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three positive samples were measured in duplicate on one instrument in 6
runs on 3 different CCP well batches together with 3 different conjugate
batches. The studies yielded the following:
Sample Mean (U/mL) Inter-run (CV %) Intra-run (CV %)
1 18.3 7.0 2.7
2 90.7 5.1 2.6
3 419 6.6 5.4
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity by dilution was tested by using 5 high positive anti-CCP samples.
The samples were tested in duplicates for dilutions at 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, and 1:16.
The results of the dilutions were compared with their expected values and the
ratios of observed-to-expected values were calculated. The following ratios
were obtained.

Two of the calculated ratios were above the specifications for this study. The
package insert includes a statement that not all sera can be diluted linearly
within the measuring range of the assay due to differing binding
characteristics of the antibodies in the patient samples. The assay measuring
range for the EliA CCP is from 0.4 to ≥ 340 EliA U/mL/
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The IgG calibrators are traceable (via an unbroken chain of calibrations) to the
International Reference Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of Human Serum
Immunoglobulins A, G and M from WHO. New batches of calibrators are
compared to a secondary standard (standardized with the IRP) or the IRP
directly and adjusted accordingly to meet the correct concentration (6 levels).
d. Detection limit:
The lower limit of the measuring range was determined by measuring
dilutions (1:2, 1:4, and 1:8) of the 4 µg/L calibrator in the Calibrator Wells.
The results in Response Units (RU) were compared with the result of the
sample diluent on CCP Wells. The discrimination ability of the assay should
be >2. All samples were measured in triplicate.

The discrimination ability was 3.8 and the 1:8 dilution of the 4 µg/L calibrator
could be discriminated from background. The lower limit of the measuring
range was set at 0.5 µg/L, corresponding to 0.4 EliA U/mL.
e. Hook effect:

serum sample with an estimated anti-CCP IgG concentration around 4400
U/mL. The sample was measured in triplicate.

g. Assay cut-off:
The purpose of the normal sera studies was to evaluate expected values in the
normal population and to confirm the defined cut-off. Samples from 400
apparently healthy Caucasian adult blood donors were measured. The
individuals were equally distributed by sex and age.

b. Matrix comparison:
Fifty sets of samples from different donors were tested in double
determinations. Each set contained serum, EDTA, heparin and citrate plasma
samples taken at the same time from a single donor. All samples were tested
and found to be negative for anti-CCP antibodies in all 4 sample types.
Antibodies were spiked into 25 of the sample sets to create 25 positive sample
sets. Linear regression comparing the quotas between serum and each type of
plasma for the positive samples was performed and showed:
Plasma r value Slope
Heparin 0.9966 0.9861
EDTA 0.9975 0.9749
Citrate 0.9987 0.9912
The data show acceptable results for plasma versus serum in positive and
negative samples.
c. Instrument platform comparison
For this comparison study, a total of 36 samples distributed over the
measuring range were assayed: 4 negative samples, 1 equivocal sample and 31
positive samples. All samples were run on three ImmunoCAP 100
instruments and three ImmunoCAP 250 instruments in two runs and in single
replicates. Results of the conformance study are summarized in the figure
