L. Test Principle:
Abbott Clinical Chemistry Creatinine is an in vitro diagnostic assay for the
quantitation of creatinine in human serum, plasma, or urine. At an alkaline pH,
creatinine in the sample reacts with picrate to form a creatinine-picrate complex. The
rate of increase in absorbance at 500 nm due to the formation of this complex is
directly proportional to the concentration of creatinine in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Serum Application: The total precision as well as the precision for each
component of variation (between-day, between-run, and within-run) was
estimated for creatinine. Two control levels (Level 1 and Level 2) at normal
and abnormal analyte concentrations were tested. These controls were
evaluated over 20 days, two runs per day, and two replicates per run. Precision

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor’s reportable range for serum and plasma is 0.20 – 37.00 mg/dL
and 5.0 – 740.0 mg/dL for urine.
Linearity of the assay across the measuring range was established by
measuring serum and urine samples at concentrations spanning the measuring
range of the assay in four replicates. At least one level was included which
exceeded the desired linear range. To measure the highest concentration
sample, the analyzer’s “linear high” and “>” error codes were suppressed. The

percent recovery for each sample was determined by dividing the mean
observed result by the expected value.
The sponsor also provided data demonstrating equivalence between the
analyzer’s auto-dilution feature and manual dilutions.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This assay utilizes the Abbott Multiconstituent Calibrator which was cleared
under k981706.
Shelf life, calibration, and on-board stability study protocols and acceptance
criteria were described and found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The functional sensitivity of the Creatinine assay was determined based on the
Limit of Quantitation (LOQ). To determine the LOQ, test levels near the
linear low for the Creatinine assay were run in replicates of 10, on three
instruments, two runs per instrument. The limit of quantitation was defined as
the lowest concentration of analyte which has imprecision less than or equal to
20% CV. An internal verification study supported an LOQ of 0.10 mg/dL for
the serum application and 2.0 mg/dL for the urine application. The (Limit of
Detection (LOD) testing for Creatinine was performed using a study design
based on CLSI EP17-A. An internal verification study supported an LOD of
0.05 mg/dL for the serum application, and 1.0 mg/dL for the urine application.
The proportions of false positives (α) and false negatives (β) were less than
5% and the limit of blank (LOB) was 0.0224 mg/dL for serum and 0.3732
mg/dL for urine.
Conclusions: The LOQ for Creatinine serum is 0.10 mg/dL and the LOD is
0.05 mg/dL. The LOQ for Creatinine urine is 2.0 mg/dL and the LOD is 1.0
mg/dL.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interferents, which may falsely elevate or reduce the concentration of an
analyte, were tested. Human serum samples at the medical decision level of
the analyte and urine samples were spiked with various levels of interferents.
Four replicates of each interferent level and four replicates of an unspiked
reference sample were run. The percent recovery was determined by dividing
the mean result of each interferent sample by the mean result of the reference
sample. Testing was performed using the AEROSET System only.
The percent interference was within ± 10% difference for serum samples
containing 30 mg/dL bilirubin; 2,000 mg/dL hemoglobin; 1,000 mg/dL
Intralipid; 3.0 mg/dL ascorbate; 300 mg/dL glucose; and 10.6 g/dL protein at
Medical Decision Level 1.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
AEROSET:
The sponsor compared 117 serum samples ranging from 0.69 to 38.36 mg/dL
(as measured by the predicate method). Samples with concentrations greater
than 25 mg/dL were diluted X2 on the predicate method but run undiluted on
the Aeroset. Linear regression produced a slope of 0.98, a y-intercept of
-0.18, and a correlation coefficient of 0.995.
The sponsor also compared 50 urine samples ranging from 7.14 to 401.72
mg/dL (as measured by the predicate method). Linear regression produced a
slope of 0.94, a y-intercept of -3.66, and a correlation coefficient of 0.999.
ARCHITECT:
The sponsor compared 117 serum samples ranging from 0.69 to 38.36 mg/dL
(as measured by the predicate method). Samples with concentrations greater
than 25 mg/dL were diluted X2 on the predicate method but run undiluted on
the Architect. Linear regression produced a slope of 0.96, a y-intercept of
-0.24, and a correlation coefficient of 0.999
The sponsor also compared 50 urine samples ranging from 7.14 to 401.72
mg/dL (as measured by the predicate method). Linear regression produced a
slope of 0.93, a y-intercept of -4.16, and a correlation coefficient of 0.999.
b. Matrix comparison:
Serum, lithium heparin plasma, and sodium heparin plasma are recommended
as acceptable matrices in the sponsor’s labeling. To demonstrate comparable
performance, the sponsor compared serum from a plain glass tube (baseline)
with serum from a gel tube, lithium heparin plasma, lithium heparin plasma
from a gel tube, and sodium heparin plasma. All of the recommended
matrices showed acceptable performance.
