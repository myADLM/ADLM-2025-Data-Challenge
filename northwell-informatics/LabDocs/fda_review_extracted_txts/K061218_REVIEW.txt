I. Device Description:
The CHEM 4 CAL is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of Albumin
(ALB) and Total Protein (TP) methods on the Dimension Vista™ System. The kit
consists of three vials of one level which are ready for use (no preparation is
required). The volume per vial is 1.5 mL. System water is used as the TP and
LAB zero calibrator (Level 1) for the Dimension Vista™ System. The vials
contain sodium azide (less than 0.1%) as a preservative.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Value assignment: The new calibrator is made by adding calculated
quantities of albumin to the base matrix (human serum) which already
contains total protein. The concentration is verified using an instrument
calibrated with the primary and secondary standards. The final bottle
assignment is assigned for the level of the commercial lot by testing N=90
replicates with multiple reagent lots on multiple instruments.
The assigned values of the ALB/TP calibrator are standardized to the
following reference materials:
