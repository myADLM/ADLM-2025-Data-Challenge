The GlucoPlus Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of a hand-held blood
glucose meter, test strips, and control materials. The user enters a code for each lot of
test strips manually; the meter software contains specific calibration information for
each code. The meter is turned on by strip insertion; the user then supplies finger-tip
blood or control solution to the strip and the meter starts the assay, which completes
in 15 seconds. The meter’s software converts the results read off the test strip into a
plasma glucose concentration and displays the value on the meter’s LCD screen.

L. Test Principle:
The test is based on the release of electrical potential after a two-step reaction where
glucose and ferricyanide, in the presence of glucose oxidase, are converted into
gluconolactone and ferrocyanide. Ferrocyanide, when electrical current is applied,
becomes ferricyanide and releases electrons; the increase in current measured by the
meter is proportional to the glucose concentration.

Within-run precision was established using whole blood samples from non-
diabetic volunteers spiked or glycolyzed to yield 6 glucose concentrations
ranging from 40 – 500 mg/dL. Results were compared to YSI values. One
strip lot was tested. Within-run precision was tested on twenty replicates of
each glucose level. Between-day precision was tested by testing two levels of
control materials (approximately 100 and 300 mg/dL) tested four times a day
over 20 days. Testing results are summarized in the tables below:
GlucoPlus: Within Run Precision

Level 1 (~100 mg/dL) 106 3.5 3.3
Level 2 (~300 mg/dL) 298 7.6 2.5
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Heparinized venous whole blood was spiked or glycolyzed to six
concentrations between 44 mg/dL and 596 mg/dL (confirmed by YSI) then
tested with the GlucoPlus and YSI. Six samples were tested for each method
for each of three lots. Regression analysis showed a linear relationship
between the GlucoPlus and the YSI method: y = 0.972x + 2.27, R = 0.999
(all lots combined).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Control materials are traceable to YSI standards which are traceable to NIST
SRM #917A (Clinical Dextrose). Real-time shelf life studies performed by the
manufacturer indicate that control solutions and the unopened test strips have
at least a 17 month life-span. Once the control solution or strip container is
opened, they have been shown to be stable for 3 months.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study above; the meter will report ‘LO’ for values less than 40
mg/dL.

e. Analytical specificity:
Assay interferents were tested in a dose-response manner following CLSI
EP7-A guidelines. Aliquots of the blood were supplemented with glucose to a
final concentration of 100 mg/dL and measured on a YSI analyzer. The
interferent was prepared with an appropriate solvent, and spiked into the 100
mg/dL blood. A control pool was prepared by supplementing the blood with
solvent minus the interferent. A series of four to five levels that included the
maximum concentration of the substance that would be expected to be
encountered in clinical practice were used for each interferent. The sponsor
defined interference as the level of compound that caused ≥ ±10% difference
between the interferent-spiked sample and a sample that did not contain
interferent.
The table below shows the effect of common interferents at the upper end
of normal or therapeutic levels on GlucoPlus test levels:
Interference at High-Normal or High Therapeutic Levels

Range (mg/dL) interference (mg/dL)
Acetaminophen 2 mg/dL 2
Bilirubin 1.2 mg/dL 5
Cholesterol 300 mg/dL 500
Creatinine 1.5 mg/dL 30
Dopamine N/A 10
Ephedrine 2 mg/dL 10
Ibuprofen 4.2 mg/dL 20
L-dopa 0.3~10 mg/dL 1 (positive bias)
Methyl dopa 0.5 mg/dL 1

Tolbutamide 10 mg/dL 10
Triglycerides 190 mg/dL 300
Ascorbic acid 2 mg/dL 2.25
Uric acid 7.7 mg/dL 5 (positive bias)
These results suggest that L-dopa, tetracycline, and uric acid at
physiologically relevant levels may cause blood samples to produce an
artificially high value. Care should be exercised by people with gout,

Parkinson’s disease, and those taking tetracycline or related antibiotics.
Hematocrit Effect:
The effect of sample hemoglobin variation on the GlucoPlus system was
tested experimentally by preparing samples of known hematocrit (Hct) and
spiking aliquots of these samples with three different levels of glucose. These
samples were run on the GlucoPlus and YSI; there was less than an ± 14%
bias across the claimed range of 30 ~ 55% Hct.
The meter was tested at different altitudes to assess the effect of low oxygen
levels on meter performance. No effect on performance was found when the
two control solutions were tested up to 8800 ft. above sea level. Higher
elevations were not tested. The sponsor presented data that supported using
the test system between 10oC to 40oC and 20 – 80% relative humidity.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
GlucoPlus Consumer Studies:
The consumer study was performed at one site with 120 lay-users and a
technician. The lay-users ranged in age, education, and were about equally
divided between males and females. The native language of most of the
participants was English. Labeling materials were in English. Each participant
performed their own fingerstick and tested their blood using the instructions in
the User’s Guide. A trained technician then performed another fingerstick and
tested the blood on the same meter. Capillary blood was collected and
measured on a YSI analyzer. Samples ranged from 57 – 481 mg/dL. Linear
regression analysis of the data yielded the results below:
Lay users vs. YSI y = 0.96x – 7.9 r = 0.985
Technician vs. YSI y = 0.95x – 6.6 r = 0.989
GlucoPlus POC Studies:
The point-of-care (POC) study was performed at three sites on a total of 100
diabetic participants by one technician at each site. Each participant was tested
twice – once each with two GlucoPlus meters - and once with the predicate
meter. Linear regression analysis of the data yielded the results below:

Total 200 y = 1.04x – 5.8 0.994 38 - 548
In this study, 28 of 28 samples that were <75 mg/dL were ±15 mg/dL and 170
of 172 samples that were ≥ 75 mg/dL were within ±20% of the reference
value.
b. Matrix comparison:
This System is cleared for use with fingerstick capillary samples. The meter’s
software adjusts the whole-blood glucose reading to a plasma-equivalent
reading.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
See Method Comparison Studies section above.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The normal fasting adult glucose range for a non-diabetic is 70 – 105 mg/dL. One
to two hours after a meal, normal blood glucose levels should be less than 140
mg/dL. A medical professional should determine the range that is appropriate for
diabetes patients.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
