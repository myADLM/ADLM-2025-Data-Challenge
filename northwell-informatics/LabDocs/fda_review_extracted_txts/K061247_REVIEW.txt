In conjunction with nontreponemal laboratory tests and clinical findings, may aid
in the diagnosis of syphilis infection.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
The LIAISON® Treponema assay is not intended for use in screening blood or
plasma donors.
Warning: A positive result is not useful for establishing a diagnosis of syphilis. In
most situations, such a result may reflect prior treated infection; a negative result
can exclude a diagnosis of syphilis except for incubating or early primary disease.
Warning: “When a sample result displays the exclamation mark (!) flag, the result
obtained lies below the assay’s signal range. The sample should be retested and
graded negative if the result is still below the signal range upon retest.”
“Assay interference due to circulating antibodies against Hepatitis A viruses,
yaws, pinta and leptospirosis have not been evaluated. The user is responsible for
establishing cross-reactivity performance with these infectious agents.”

L. Test Principle:
Recombinant antigens specific for T. pallidum are used for coating the magnetic particles
(solid phase) and are used in the tracer when linked to an isoluminol derivative
(isoluminol-antigen conjugate).
All assay steps and incubations are performed by the LIAISON® Analyzer, with the
exception of initial magnetic particle resuspension.
During the incubation step antibodies present in the calibrators, samples or controls bind
to the solid phase. The conjugate reacts with the antibodies already bound to the solid
phase. After the incubation, the unbound material is removed with a wash cycle.
Subsequently, the starter reagents are added and a flash Chemiluminescence reaction is
induced. The light signal and hence the amount of isoluminol-antigen conjugate is
measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is indicative of total
antibodies to Treponema pallidum present in calibrators, controls or samples.

Reproducibility testing was performed at 3 US sites, using four replicates per
run in one run per day during five operating days and a different lot of the
LIAISON® Treponema Reagent Integral kit lot was used for each site. A
coded panel comprised of 9 frozen “engineered” serum samples and the
LIAISON® Treponema Serum controls were included in the study. The panel
consisted of 4 samples near the cut-off, 2 negative, 2 low positive and 1
positive. The table below reflects the summary of results of the
reproducibility study among the 3 sites.

*Sample numbers 1007 and 1008 were negative samples that read below the assay
range and Index values were nondetectable. Relative Light Units (Signal) were
used in the precision summary table.
b. Linearity / Assay Reportable Range
The assay range is 0.1 to 70 Index. Negative results can be below the assay
range, these samples are reported as <0.1 Index and positive samples above 70 are
reported as >70 Index.
Samples containing extremely high antibody concentrations (prozone) when
tested in a one-step sandwich assay may exhibit a hook effect and mimic
concentrations that are lower than expected. Analysis of the hook effect for the
LIAISON® Treponema assay was evaluated by testing 3 high titered samples
positive for total antibodies against Treponema pallidum. All 3 neat samples had
Index values >70 (the high end of the reportable range). The samples were serially
diluted and the results of the dilutions gave expected results with the sample
Index decreasing in value with each dilution. An approximation of the total Index
value by correcting for the dilution factor (i.e.1:2) shows no high dose hook effect
in samples with an anti-Treponema Index between 73.4 and 132. Two other
samples that had high antibody concentrations, but did not read above the assay
range of 70, were also analyzed. Both of these samples were serially diluted and
results obtained gave expected results with the sample Index decreasing in value

with each dilution as well.
A statement concerning High-Dose hook effect will be included in the
Instructions for Use “Whenever samples containing extremely high antibody
concentrations are tested in a one-step sandwich method, the hook effect can
mimic concentrations lower than expected. Analysis of hook effect was done by
serially diluting three high-titered samples positive for total antibodies to
Treponema pallidum. All neat samples had an Index value above the measuring
range (>70), which would be expected with high-titer sera. An approximation of
the Index value by correcting for the dilution factor (i.e. 1:2) shows no high dose
hook effect was observed in samples with an anti-Treponema Index of
approximately 132.”
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The LIAISON® Treponema Serum controls consist of 1 negative and 1 positive
and are intended for use as assayed quality control samples to monitor the
performance of the LIAISON® Treponema assay. Control performance has not
been established for matrices other than serum. The reference range of each
control is reported on the corresponding vial label.

samples. The data obtained showed results within the expected range. A claim of
four weeks on-board stability has been included in the package insert.
Calibration stability study was also performed using one lot. After initial
calibration of newly opened reagent integral, samples were tested and integral was
stored on board the instrument, in the refrigerated area. At established intervals,
positive and negative samples were tested using the stored integral and original
calibration. 2-week calibration stability is claimed in the insert.
Open vial stability was evaluated using 2 lots of LIAISON® Treponema Serum
controls. These controls were placed on the analyzer and tested in replicates of 6
at specified time intervals. 4-week open vial stability will be used.
d. Detection limit:
This is a qualitative assay (Pos, Neg, or Equivocal Results) so there is no limit of
detection. Negative samples can be read below the low end of the assay range of
0.1 and are given a <0.1 result. There is a low limit of 350 RLU, for the
LIAISON® Treponema Assay. Any sample below this limit will have an error
code (!) next to the result and sample must be repeated.
The following warning statement has been added to the package insert under the
Interpretation of results section to address results below the low limit of the assay
range “When a sample result displays the exclamation mark (!) flag, the result
obtained lies below the assay’s signal range. The sample should be retested and
graded negative if the result is still below the signal range upon retest.”
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-Reactivity Study
Two hundred forty four samples were tested for cross-reactivity; which was
performed at DiaSorin S.p.A., DiaSorin, Inc. and at European clinical laboratories.
Samples with negative or equivocal results by the predicate device and the
LIAISON® Treponema Assay were considered not to demonstrate cross reactivity.
Cross reactivity could not be determined in samples that returned positive values by
the reference method as no additional testing of the samples by darkfield or DFA-TP
or equivalent methods was done. The table below reflects the cross reactivity study.

Samples that are positive for antibodies against Hepatitis A virus and negative
for T. pallidum and samples for yaws, pinta and leptospirosis are unavailable
therefore the following limitation statement will be included “Assay interference
due to circulating antibodies against Hepatitis A viruses, yaws, pinta and leptospirosis
have not been evaluated. The user is responsible for establishing cross-reactivity
performance with these infectious agents.”
Interference Study
Testing was performed to determine whether the presence of hemoglobin,
bilirubin or triglycerides will interfere with assay results. Ten negative and 10 positive
samples at different level of antibodies to T. pallidum were spiked with a known amount
of an interfering substance with no significant difference between the two sample types.

Influence of Sample Storage
1) Freeze-thawing
The effect of freeze-thawing sample was evaluated using 4 negative and 4
positive samples. Although samples cycled through freeze-thaws did not
have any apparent effect on the assay performance, the following statement
has been included in the package insert to follow CLSI’s recommendation
“Samples should not be repeatedly frozen and thawed. Self-defrosting
freezers are not recommended for sample storage.”
2) Sample Storage at 2 - 8° C

In this study, 4 negative and 4 positive samples were used to demonstrate the
effect of sample storage at 2 - 8° C with no effect on assay performance. The
following statement has been included in the submission “Samples may be
kept at 2 - 8°C for no longer than 7 days, otherwise they should be dispensed
in aliquots and stored deep-frozen (-20°C or below).”
Carry Over Effect
Sample carry-over has been evaluated by testing a negative sample before and
after a high positive sample with no observable effect.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off for the LIAISON® Treponema Assay was determined during
European clinical trials using 3,625 samples. An analysis of the cumulative
frequency distributions (ROC analysis) was performed on the LIAISON® Treponema
Assay results for the 1000 non selected routine laboratory samples, 131 characterized
syphilis samples and 2494 donor samples. The relevant cumulative frequency
distribution graph was generated by calculating sensitivity from the 131 (positive)
characterized syphilis samples and the 48 (positive) routine laboratory samples while
specificity was determined from 952 (negative) routine laboratory samples, and the
2494 blood donors. Analysis of the data showed that the cut-off value discriminating
between the presence and the absence of T. pallidum total antibodies has an Index
value of 1.0 with an equivocal zone between 0.9 and <1.1.
The cut-off was verified in the United States during clinical trials where 97%
gave Index values less than 0.5 and 97.9% gave Index values greater than 1.4.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical testing was performed at 3 US sites - 2 external and 1 in-house testing
using frozen prospective and retrospective samples received from sample
procurement organizations that have been supplied with the selection criteria.
The clinical study was divided into 2 groups where in Study #1 LIAISON®
Treponema Assay was utilized as a clinical laboratory screen (diagnostic test),
and Study #2 LIAISON® Treponema Assay was utilized as a diagnostic
confirmatory test.
All samples were tested with the LIAISON® Treponema Assay and the
predicate device, Trinity CAPTIA™ Syphilis (T. pallidum) – G. Discordant
samples were further tested as described in the Use of Treponemal Tests to
Screen for Syphilis.

Equivocal samples must be retested in order to confirm the initial result. Samples
which are positive at the second test should be considered positive. Samples
which are negative at the second test should be considered negative. A second
sample should be collected and tested no less than one week later when the result
is repeated equivocal.
