--- Page 2 ---
1. Intended use(s):
Amoxicillin-clavulanate at 0.5/0.25 – 32/16 μg/mL, Ampicillin-sulbactam at
0.5/0.25 – 32/16 μg/mL, Ticarcillin at 1 – 128 µg/mL on the Phoenix™ Gram
Negative ID/AST or AST only panel is intended for use with the BD Phoenix
Automated Microbiology System for the quantitative determination of
antimicrobial susceptibility by minimal inhibitory concentration of gram-negative
aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria belonging to the family
Enterobacteriaceae and non – Enterobacteriaceae.
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is intended for the in vitro
quantitative determination of antimicrobial susceptibility by minimal inhibitory
concentration (MIC) of most gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic
bacteria isolates from pure culture for Enterobacteriaceae and non –
Enterobacteriaceae and most Gram-positive bacteria isolates from pure culture
belonging to the genera Staphylococcus and Enterococcus.
2. Indication(s) for use:
This device is indicated for additional organism groups and amoxicillin-
clavulanate at 0.5/0.25 – 32/16 μg/mL, ampicillin-sulbactam at 0.5/0.25 – 32/16
μg/mL, ticarcillin at 1 – 128 µg/mL on the Phoenix™ Gram Negative ID/AST or
AST only panel.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
Results for Acinetobacter species and Proteus species with ampicillin-sulbactam
has been excluded in the BD Phoenix™ therefore no results will be reported. An
alternate method should be performed when this combination is identified.
Results for Proteus vulgaris/penneri with ticarcillin has been excluded in the BD
Phoenix™ therefore no results will be reported. An alternate method should be
performed when this combination is identified.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST
Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and
equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™
Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST broth, which contains an AST
2

indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST broth is a cation-adjusted formulation
of Mueller-Hinton broth containing 0.01% Tween 80. After adding the indicator solution
to the AST inoculum the color is blue and after inoculation and incubation changes to
pink then to colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds. Inoculated panels are
barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System
instrument where the panels are continuously incubated at 350C. The AST has a final
inoculum of 5 x 105 CFU/ml. The instrument incubates, reads and records the results of
the biochemical substrates and antimicrobial agents and interprets the reactions to give an
ID of the isolate and MIC value and category interpretation of the antimicrobial agents.
Organisms growing in the presence of a given antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator,
signaling organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or
inhibited by a given antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do
not produce a color change. Additional interpretation is done using software driven
“EXPERT” System using rules derived from the NCCLS documentation.
Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an ID result available between 2-12 hours and
an AST result available between 4-16 hours. This is only an autoread result; there are no
manual readings possible.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S16) “Methods for
Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard.”
L. Test Principle:
The system employs conventional, colorimetric, fluorogenic and chromogenic
substrates to identify the genus and species of the isolate. The AST portion of the BD
Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth based microdilution method
that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance detection
of organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells
containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control
wells” which contains no antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Ten isolates were evaluated for site to site and inter site reproducibility
demonstrating >95% reproducibility. The ten isolate study described in the
guidance document was used (10 organisms tested 3 times on 3 days at 3
sites).

reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference
method. Category agreement (CA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panel result
interpretation (SIR) agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation.
Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the BD Phoenix™ and
the reference and have on-scale EA.
