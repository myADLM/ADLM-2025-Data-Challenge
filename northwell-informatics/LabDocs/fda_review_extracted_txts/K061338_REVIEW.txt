K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI Approved Guideline for Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical
Devices: EP5-A2
CLSI EP7-A, Interference testing in Clinical Chemistry
L. Test Principle:
Proteins contained in human body fluids form immune complexes in an
immunochemical reaction with specific antibodies. These complexes scatter a
beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is
proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The
result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was done in accordance with CLSI Approved
Guideline for Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Devices:
EP5-A. Specimens at each level were analyzed in duplicate, twice a day,
for 20 days. The within-run and total standard deviations (SD) and
percent coefficient of variation (%CV) were calculated by the analysis
of variance method. Additional testing covering the low and high end of
the reportable range was performed. The data are summarized below

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed on the Dimension VISTA® System
using a serum sample containing 9.32 g/L of IgA. The sample was
serially diluted 12 times. Each dilution was tested in replicates of five
and percent recovery calculated. All dilutions met the acceptance
criterion of 80 to 120%.
The linear regression was calculated. The acceptance criteria of slope
between 0.9 and 1.1 and correlation coefficient ≥0.95 were met. Data
showed a regression equation y = 1.0161x – 0.038, r2 of 0.9975.
Linearity was observed at 0.21 to9.32 g/L. Reportable range for the
device was set at 0.25 to 7.5 g/L.
Prozone effect
The possibility of Prozone effect occurring when using the device was
evaluated with a serum sample above the assay range. The sample was
analyzed on both the BN Prospec System and the Dimension Vista
instrument, indicating no hook effect up to 35.8 g/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
The reference material is the IFCC/BCR/CAP CRM 470. Master
Calibrator concentrated human serum pool was assayed vs. CRM 470.
Commercial Calibrator Lot was prepared from human serum pool at
target concentrations and assayed against the master lot.
Stability studies were performed and the following conclusions were
obtained:
• On-Board Instrument Stability of opened product
a. The Immunoglobulin A Flex reagent cartridge are stable
on –board the instrument for 21 days.
b. PROT1 CAL is stable for 9 days.
c. Controls are stable for 14 days.
Study duration is labeled product shelf life plus one month. 24

months shelf life requires testing a minimum of 1 month past 24
months. Product is stored at 2-8oC throughout the testing cycle and
tested on day 0 and after 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 and 25 months.
d. Detection limit:
Detection limit (0.25 g/L) represents the lower limit of the reportable
range of IgA.
The analytical sensitivity of the assay represents the lowest
concentration of IgA that can be distinguished from zero. This is defined
as the mean value (n=20) plus two standard deviations of the low level 1
(1:200 dilution) using PROT1 CAL and system diluent. This was found
to be 0.043 g/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference: Interference testing was performed using guidance supplied
by CLSI EP7-A, “Interference testing in Clinical Chemistry”. No
significant interference was observed in:
• Hemoglobin up to 1000mg/dL
• Bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated) up to 60 mg/dL
• Triglycerides up to 709mg/dL
• Rheumatoid Factor interference is below 10% up to 6.820 g/L.
No cross-reactivity studies have been conducted with heterophile
antibodies.
Non Interfering Substance section of the package insert provides a list of
drugs and other exogenous substances that do not interfere with the
assay.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The reported expected range for Immunoglobulin A in adults (0.7 – 4.0 g/L)
is from a literature:
Dati F. Schumann G,Thomas L, et al. Consensus of a Group of Professional Societies and
Diagnostic Companies on Guidelines for Interim Reference Ranges for 14 Proteins in
Serum base on the Standardization against the IFCC/BCR/CAP Reference Material (CRM
470). Eur J Clin Chem Biochem 34:517-520, 1996.
During childhood and adolescence, reference ranges for IgA are dependent
on age and can vary over a wide range.
Each laboratory should establish its own normal ranges since values may
differ depending on the population studied.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part
809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and
supports a substantial equivalence decision.
