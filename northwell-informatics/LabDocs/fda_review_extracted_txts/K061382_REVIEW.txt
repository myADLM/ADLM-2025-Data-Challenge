L. Test Principle:
The Access TPO Antibody assay is a sequential two-step immunoenzymatic
("sandwich") assay. A sample is added to a reaction vessel with paramagnetic
particles coated with thyroid peroxidase protein. The serum or plasma TPOAb binds
to the thyroid peroxidase. After incubation in a reaction vessel, materials bound to
the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed
away. The thyroid peroxidase-alkaline phosphatase conjugate is added and binds to
the TPOAb. After the second incubation, materials bound to the solid phase are held
in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the
chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phos 530 is added to the vessel and light generated
by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is directly
proportional to the concentration of TPOAb in the sample. The amount of analyte in
the sample is determined from a stored, multi-point calibration curve. This is a well-
recognized assay methodology that presents no new technical issues.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Assay precision was verified using a method based on CLSI/NCCLS EP05-A,
Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices. The
method consisted of assaying six serum samples for a minimum of 19 runs,
minimum of 4 replicates per assay over 30 days completing one run per day
on the Access, Access 2 and UniCel DxI 800 platforms. Three lots of
reagents and one lot of calibrators were tested in this study. The
concentrations for this study were chosen to represent the typical distribution
of values to be found in patient samples. The mean of the replicates, standard
deviation, and the percent CV for within run, between run and total precision
were determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA) per EP05-A.
The Access TPO Antibody assay exhibited total imprecision of <12% at
concentrations ≥ 0.6 IU/mL. All 3 lots of reagents tested met this total
imprecision claim. Design specifications for total imprecision were met.
Results from one of the lots of reagents tested are provided in the tables
below.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Dilution Recovery (Linearity)
Dilution recovery studies for the Access TPO Antibody assay were completed
using the UniCel DxI 800 platform. Six dilutions (1:2, 1:5, 1:10, 1:25, 1:50
and 1:100) were prepared from each of six serum samples or pools using
Sample Diluent A and tested in replicates of four. All samples were tested on
a UniCel DxI 800 instrument. For each dilution, an observed value was
calculated by computing the mean of the replicates. The percent recovery was
then calculated as follows: (Observed value ÷ Expected value) x 100%. In
addition, the observed values were plotted vs. the expected values for each
sample and a linear regression analysis was performed.
4

--- Page 5 ---
The Access TPO Antibody assay exhibited acceptable recovery upon sample
dilution with slopes ranging from 0.920 to 1.057 and the intercepts ranging
from -4.8 to -0.1 IU/mL. The study results shown in the tables below met the
design specifications. The expected and observed values are expressed in
IU/mL. In antibody assays, dilution recovery results may be affected by the
antibody affinity, so an appropriate statement was added to the Access TPO
Antibody insert: “Due to varying antigen specificity, affinity and avidity of
thyroid peroxidase antibodies in their epitope reactions, some samples may
not dilute linearly”.
The assay reportable range is 0 to 1000 IU/mL.
5

--- Page 6 ---
High-Dose Hook Effect
High dose hook or prozone effect can occur in 2-site simultaneous
immunoassays when at high doses, the concentration of analyte exceeds the
6

--- Page 7 ---
capacity of the capture antibody to bind it. Free analyte is sequestered by
labeled second antibody and the resultant value “hooks” back and reads on the
standard curve, giving a falsely depressed value. A naturally occurring high
TPOAb patient serum sample with a value >10,000 IU/mL was diluted
serially 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32, 1:64, 1:128, and 1:256 in Sample Diluent A.
All dilutions were assayed in duplicate on an Access 2 instrument. The results
were plotted graphically (dose vs. RLU) and the graph and data were visually
evaluated for the presence of a high dose hook. Although the RLUs tended to
plateau at doses higher than the standard curve S5 value of 1000 IU/mL, there
was no indication of a hook effect as high as the highest assayed value of
10,654 IU/mL. The RLUs at 10,654 IU/mL did not fall below the S5 RLU.
Therefore there was no hook effect up to 10,000 IU/mL and the assay met the
design specification. Results are summarized in the table and graph below.

Calibrator Stability
Open vial - To verify the open vial stability for the calibrators at the
recommended storage conditions of 2-10°C, three quality control samples
were assayed at five time points (0, 1, 2, 3 and 6 months). The mean value for
each control level at each time period was compared to the expected range.
All results for all time periods were within range. The manufacturer
recommends an open vial stability of 120 days.
Calibration curve - To verify the 56 day stability for the stored calibration
curve, three quality control samples were assayed in replicates of two, and
five patient samples were assayed in replicates of five at multiple time points
between day 0 and day 63 after the establishment of a new six point
calibration curve. The mean value for each control level at each time period
was compared to the target value of that control on day zero and compared to
the expected range. All points were within range and support a recommended
calibration curve stability of 56 days.
Shelf-life - To verify the stability for the calibrators at the recommended
storage conditions of 2-10°C, two quality control samples and five patient
samples were assayed at various time points, including time 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 13,
and 15 months. The mean value for each control level at each time period is
compared to the target value of that control on day zero and compared to the
expected range. All points were within range and support a calibrator shelf-
life of 12 months at 2-10°C.
d. Detection limit/analytical sensitivity:
The analytical sensitivity or theoretical lower limit of detection is defined as
the lowest detectable level of TPO Ab that, with 95% confidence, can be
distinguished from the S0 calibrator. A six-point calibration curve, controls
and ten replicates of the zero calibrator were run in multiple assays on each
platform. The mean SD and %CV were calculated for each set of ten
replicates and the analytical sensitivity value was calculated from the curve at
the point that was two standard deviations from the mean fitted S0 calibrator
signal (RLUs). Ten studies were conducted in which a six-point calibration
curve, controls and ten replicates of the TPO Antibody calibrator S0 were run
in multiple assays. The experiments incorporated two lots of reagent, one lot
of calibrators and the Access, Access 2, and UniCel DxI 800 platforms. The
mean, SD and %CV were calculated for each set of ten replicates.
The lowest detectable level of TPO Ab distinguishable from zero (Access
TPO Antibody S0 Calibrator) with 95% confidence was 0.0034 IU/mL on the
Access platform, 0.0036 IU/mL on the UniCel DxI platform, and 0.0049
IU/mL on the Access 2 platform. The results of these studies demonstrated
that the Access TPO Antibody assay met the design specification. In order to
assure claims are consistently met, the following information is provided in
the Access TPO Antibody directional insert: “The lowest detectable level of
thyroid peroxidase antibodies distinguishable from zero (Access TPO
Antibody Calibrator S0) with 95% confidence is 0.25 IU/mL.”

e. Analytical specificity:
The Access TPO Antibody assay was tested for analytical specificity, as
described in CLSI/NCCLS EP07-A, Interference Testing in Clinical
Chemistry. Interference from normal human blood constituents (hemoglobin,
triglycerides, bilirubin and human serum albumin), heterophile antibodies, and
commonly encountered medications were evaluated in the Access TPO
Antibody assay.
Interference from Heterophile Antibodies
Immunoenzymetric assay technology may demonstrate interferences from
heterophile antibodies, including human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA).
While the assay has been formulated to minimize the effects of these
antibodies, results must be carefully evaluated. To address this issue, a
cautionary note, regarding samples containing such antibodies, is included in
the labeling:
Interfering Substances
To evaluate potential interference, the substances listed in the table below
were spiked individually into normal human serum. Samples were measured
using the Access TPO Antibody assay and the dose of each spiked sample was
compared to the dose of the neat sample. For each substance analyzed, an
observed value was calculated by computing the mean of fifteen replicate
measurements of the spiked sample. The expected value was equal to the
mean of the replicates of the neat sample prior to addition of the substance.
The interference was calculated as follows: [mean observed value - mean
expected value / mean expected value] X 100 = Mean % Interference. The
Access TPO Antibody assay exhibited no significant interference when
samples were spiked with the substances listed in the table below. The results
of the studies met design specifications.

f. Assay cut-off:
Sera samples were obtained in the United States from 166 males, 30 years of
age following the criteria outlined by the National Academy of Clinical
Biochemists (NACB) for establishing a normal reference range for thyroid
antibody tests. The screening criteria included: serum TSH levels between 0.5
and 2.0 mIU/L; no goiter; no personal or family history of thyroid disease; and
absence of non-thyroid autoimmune disease. After completing the screen, 124
samples were tested generating a 95% non-parametric upper reference limit
below 9 IU/mL.
Additionally, 679 normal samples were collected in the United States from
both males and females ranging in age from 18–80 years old. The screening
criteria included the same criteria as listed above. After completing the
screen, 492 samples were tested and 93% of these samples fell below 9
IU/mL.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The correlation between results obtained using the Access Immunoassay
System TPO Antibody assay and the DPC Immulite 2000 Anti-TPO Ab assay
was evaluated by linear regression and concordance analyses. The DPC
Immulite 2000 Anti-TPO Ab assay was chosen as the predicate device as it is
a well established assay on an automated platform. The studies described
below followed applicable ICH (International Conference of Harmonization)
and GCP (Good Clinical Practice) requirements. IEC (Internal Ethics
Committee) oversight and approval was received prior to study initiation. A
10

--- Page 11 ---
total of 320 residual de-linked serum samples were enrolled and tested on
Access 2 and Immulite 2000 automated immunoassay analyzers at an external
laboratory. All specimens were originally submitted to the laboratory for
thyroid marker (including thyroid peroxidase antibody) testing; they were
enrolled in the study based on the result of the TPOAb assay used by the site
for diagnostic testing. Residual specimens from males and females 18 years
of age and greater were included. Only one sample from any given subject
was enrolled. All 320 results were included in the concordance analysis. The
graph below illustrates the outcomes of quality control sample testing over the
course of the study. The upper and lower limits of acceptance for each control
level are indicated by dashed lines. All controls fell within the established
boundaries.
TPO Antibody (Method Comparison): QC Recovery
Results from the comparison (mean of duplicates for the Access TPO
Antibody assay and singlicate results for the Immulite 2000 Anti-TPO Ab
assay) were analyzed using Deming regression to determine the
correlation between the two assays.
11

--- Page 12 ---
Using Deming regression analysis, results from the Methods Comparison
across the 0-1000 IU/mL concentration range demonstrated acceptable
agreement between the Access and DPC Immulite assays. The correlation
coefficient (r) was 0.97 and the slope of the regression line was 1.0207 with a
95% confidence interval of 0.9722 to 1.0693. The y-intercept was -10.9123
with a 95% confidence interval of -24.6421 to 2.8175. The results of the
study indicate that the slope and intercept and were not significantly different
from one and zero.
Concordance was evaluated using specimens that provided a total of 97 final
determinations classified as positive by the Immulite 2000 Anti-TPOAb
method and 223 final determinations classified as negative by the Immulite
2000 Anti-TPOAb method. The Immulite 2000 Anti-TPOAb cut-off is 35
IU/mL and the Access TPO Antibody assay upper reference limit was
determined to be < 9 IU/mL. The table below shows the concordance
between the Access TPO Antibody assay and the Immulite 2000 Anti-TPOAb
method. Results from the concordance analysis met design specifications.

Method Comparison: Access Systems Cross-Platform Studies
To verify the equivalence of the Access platform family members with respect
to the Access TPO Antibody assay, a method comparison study was
performed. The study provided the following paired platform comparisons:
• Access 2 vs. Access
• UniCel DxI 800 vs. Access
• UniCel DxI 800 vs. Access 2
The LXi Synchron 725 and UniCel DxC 600i incorporate an Access 2 system
and were represented by the Access 2 in this correlation study. Additional
information on the equivalence of the LXi Synchron 725 and the UniCel DxC
600 I to the other members of the Access instrumentation family can be found
in 510(k) notifications k060256 and k023049.
Ten patient samples with TPOAb concentrations distributed from 0.5 to 770
IU/mL were tested in duplicate, in two runs per day, for a period of five days,
on each of the Access platforms. A new calibration curve was run on each of
the five days in order to simulate the variability observed across multiple
instruments. Controls were run each day to monitor performance of the
Access TPO Antibody assay system. Following CLSI/NCCLS
recommendations in EP9-A2 Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using
Patient Samples; Approved Guideline, 2nd Ed. a linear regression model was
used to evaluate cross platform equivalence. An evaluation of the slopes
observed in this study showed analytical differences between the platforms of
less than or equal to 4%, when compared to each other and to a theoretical
slope of 1.0. The slope differences, although statistically significant (p<0.5)
for the Access vs. DxI comparison, met the design specification of ≤10%
difference between the platforms. The intercepts were not statistically
different from zero in any of the comparisons. The linear regression data is
summarized in the table below.

b. Matrix comparison:
A comparison study was performed using 37 matched serum and plasma
(EDTA and lithium heparin) samples that span the assay range. Samples were
run as duplicates on an Access, Access 2 or UniCel DxI 800 system. Twenty-
seven (27) samples were tested on the Access and UniCel DxI 800 systems.
Ten (10) samples were tested on the Access 2 system. For the serum versus
EDTA plasma study, n=64. This number represents the 27 samples tested
both on the Access and UniCel DxI 800 systems and the 10 samples tested on
the Access 2 system (27+27+10 =64). For the serum versus lithium heparin
study, n=61. This number represents the 27 samples tested on both the Access
and UniCel DxI 800 systems and the 10 tested on the Access 2 system, minus
3 samples that were removed from the analysis due to either insufficient
testing volume or instrument error (27+27+10-3= 61).
Following CLSI/NCCLS recommendations in EP14-A2, Evaluation of Matrix
Effects, 2nd Ed., a linear regression model was used to evaluate the correlation
between the sample types. The slope and intercept were determined using a
Deming regression; the correlation coefficient was determined by linear
regression. Acceptable correlation was demonstrated between plasma
(EDTA, heparin) and serum sample types. The slope differences, although
statistically significant (p<0.05), were less than 7% and met design
specifications.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Methodology: The Access TPO Antibody assay was evaluated using sera
obtained from 54 patients diagnosed with Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis and 40
patients diagnosed with Graves’ disease. These pathological samples were
acquired from independent laboratories with an established diagnosis. The
presence of TPO antibodies was not a criterion for disease diagnosis.
Duplicates of each sample were tested for TPO Ab using a UniCel DxI 800
instrument. Statistical Analysis: The mean TPO Antibody result was obtained
and compared against the upper reference limit for normal samples of 9
IU/mL. Results are summarized in the table below.
Disease state Number of patients Percent positive
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis 54 100%
Grave’s disease 40 77.5%
The Access TPO Antibody assay results provided above are consistent with
the literature which reports that for patients with autoimmune thyroid disease,
TPO Ab is almost invariably positive in Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis and is often
positive in Graves’ disease. (Feldt-Rasmussen, U. Clin Chem 1996; 42: 160-
163, Analytical and clinical performance goals for testing autoantibodies to
thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin, and thyrotropin receptor).
b. Clinical specificity:
In normal population studies, 492 samples were tested and 93% of these
samples fell below the established cut-off.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
See assay cut-off.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Up to 5% of the normal healthy blood donor population may have thyroid
autoantibodies even with no prior history of thyroid or other autoimmune disease.
Moderately increased levels of TPO antibodies may be found in patients with
non-thyroid autoimmune disease such as pernicious anemia, Type I diabetes
mellitus, or other disorders which activate the immune system.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
