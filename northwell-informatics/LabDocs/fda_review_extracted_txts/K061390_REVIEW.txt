L. Test Principle:
Not applicable.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The assigned values of the Enzyme 2 Calibrator are verified on a
Dimension® instrument calibrated with an approved Master Pool. Master
Pool values is assigned on multiple Dimension® clinical chemistry
instruments.
Stability: Calibrator shelf life for the Dimension Vista™ Enzyme 2 Calibrator
was determined to be 12 months. A vial that has been punctured (opened) by
the instrument and stored on board has a seven day stability claim. Stability
study protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be
acceptable.

Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Not applicable
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
