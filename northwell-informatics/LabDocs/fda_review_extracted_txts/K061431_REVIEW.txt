The manufacturer of the EasyGluco Diabetes Monitoring System utilized NCCLS (EP6-P2)
Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Analytical Methods; Proposed Guideline –
Second Edition (2001).
L. Test Principle:
This device is an in vitro diagnostic product intended for the measurement of glucose
concentration in human blood. The principle of the test relies upon a specific type of glucose
in the blood sample, the dehydrogenase glucose that reacts to electrodes in the test strip. The
test strip employs an electrochemical signal generating an electrical current that will
stimulate a chemical reaction. This reaction is measured by the Meter and displayed as the
blood glucose result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
The sponsor established the performance characteristics of the EASYGLUCO Diabetes
Monitoring System by conducting within-run precision, and day-to-day precision studies.
Results of these two sets of studies are shown below:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within day precision of the EASYGLUCO Diabetes Monitoring System was
established by testing 4mL of blood that was treated with EDTA through a vacuum
tube. Glucose was then added to the 4mL of blood to generate 10 different levels of
glucose concentration for the test. Each of the test samples was measured 5 times. In
order to obtain low samples <2.8 mmol/L (<50mg/dL), the sponsor collected

According to the sponsor the polynomial evaluation of linearity assumes that the data
set is not linear. This approach assumes that the data points fall perfectly on a line or
curve in the absence of random error. The method consists of two parts. The first part
examines whether a nonlinear polynomial fits the data better than a linear one. The
second part assesses whether the difference between the best-fitting nonlinear and
linear polynomial is less than the amount of allowable bias for the method, which
should be predefined.
The nonlinear 2nd fits the data better than a linear one, but the difference is lower than
1.3 mg/dL from 8.2 mg/dl to 615.6 mg/dL. The R2 of 1st order regression is a 0.9999.

is provided in three levels. The controls are aqueous materials containing known
concentration of glucose, stabilizers, buffers, preservatives and dyes. The controls
targeted concentrations are 50 mg/dL, 110 mg/dL, and 300 mg/dL.
Stability: Accelerated stability data testing suggests that the EasyGluco test strip and
control solution have a shelf life of 2 years if stored between 2~30 ˚C. Real-time
stability studies are ongoing.
d. Detection limit:
See precision and linearity studies above. The operating range of the meter is 20 –
600 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Potential endogenous and exogenous interferents of the EasyGluco system were
tested in a dose-response method following NCCLS EP7-P. A series of test samples,
systematically varying in the concentration of the interferent, was prepared by making
quantitative, volumetric admixtures of two pools: one at the highest concentration to
be tested and the other at the lowest. The below table provides a summary of the
tested interferents.

A series of five levels that included the maximum concentration of the substance that
would be expected to be encountered in clinical practice were used for each
substance. The interferent effect was calculated from the linear relationship between
the tested concentrations of each substance.
The EasyGluco Test Strips are specific to D-glucose and do not react with other
sugars which may be present. Hematocrit levels less than 30% may cause falsely high
readings. Hematocrit levels greater than 55% may cause falsely low readings. Blood
samples that contain large amounts of ascorbic acid and uric acid may cause a slightly
higher result than the actual glucose level. High concentrations of Dopamine,
Gentistic acid and other reducing substances may cause inaccurately high results.
Lipemic samples; Cholesterol up to 500 mg/dL or triglycerides up to 2890 mg/dL do
not significantly affect the results.
Temperature
Temperature studies for the EasyGluco Blood Glucose Monitoring System
demonstrate that the instrument performs acceptably over the allowable operating
range of the meter (10°C to 40°C or 50°F to 104°F).
High-Altitude
A simulated high-altitude study was conducted to test the effect on pO by changing
2
the pO level in a whole blood sample from 153mmHg to 76mmHg by Tonometry
2
method, blowing a humidified mixed gas (O CO , and N ,) into the blood sample to
2, 2 2
adjust the pO level of the sample. As described in the table below that shows the
2
barometric pressure (standard atmosphere) and equivalent tracheal pO at increasing
2
altitudes, at 10,000 feet pO is 100mmHg that is 32% lower than at sea level
2
(149mmHg).

The sponsor collected venous blood from healthy donors and added the proper
volume of glucose to create a low, medium, and high sample. The samples pO
2
content was then adjusted to 76, 94, and 153 mmHg by tonometry. The pO content
2
of the blood samples was measured by using the Nova STAT Profile M, blood
gas/electrolyte analyzer. The glucose concentration of the blood samples were
measured by the YSI glucose analyzer, EasyGluco, and predicate OneTouch Ultra
Blood Glucose Monitoring System. See below summary of interference by pO

mmHg with the standard 100 mmHg. The error % of the OneTouch Ultra is -2.3 –
9.0% and EasyGluco is -3.5 – 5.5 % which met the sponsor’s established acceptance
criteria.
The sponsor performed an additional altitude study in an aircraft cabin at an altitude
of approximately 1,500m3. The altitude study results indicate that the EasyGluco
Blood Glucose Monitoring System showed no evidence to suggest a systematic effect
due to lack of atmospheric oxygen at 11,568 m which is equal to 37,953 feet.
Hematocrit
Samples of blood were taken randomly from 64 diabetic patients. Adjustments were
made to the hematocrit values to span a range of 30% to 55%. A total of eighty
samples with glucose ranging from 50 to 580 mg/dL were tested using the EasyGluco
meter and the YSI. The results indicated that for 17 samples below 75mg/dL the bias
ranged from -2% to 9% and for the 63 samples above 75 mg/dL the bias ranged from
9

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The EasyGluco Blood Glucose Monitoring System was assessed by comparing blood
glucose results obtained by patients with those obtained using the Hitachi 747, a laboratory
instrument. Glucose levels were measured on fresh capillary blood specimens by 100
diabetic patients (layperson) and a trained healthcare professional. Separated results were
recorded by patient and healthcare professional within 2 minutes and a venous blood sample
was collected within 5 minutes for testing on the Hitachi lab instrument.
100% of the test results done by technician and 100% of the test results by consumer were
within zone A of the Error Grid.

Alternate Site Testing with the EasyGluco System:
Alternate Site Testing of the EasyGluco Blood Glucose Monitoring System was
previously accessed with clearance of 510(k) submission k043512. Testing on the
palm, forearm, thigh, calf, and fingertips were evaluated by using the same lancing
device included with this meter. Glucose values from alternate sites were assessed in
an in-house study of 160 subjects with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes during a normally
scheduled clinic visit by a trained technician. The technician first obtained fingerstick
glucose readings from the subjects using the EasyGluco and OneTouch Ultra and then
obtained alternate site glucose readings from the arm, palm, calf and thigh of the
subjects on the EasyGluco and One Touch Ultra. The readings were taken as close in
time as possible.
Within 5 minutes a venous whole blood sample was drawn from alternate sites and
centrifuged for obtaining serum samples. The serum samples were tested on the
Hitachi 727 chemistry analyzer.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The EasyGluco Diabetes Monitoring System labeling states that self-testing of blood
glucose levels provides a way to control your diabetes. Diabetics should consult with
their physician to determine the best range of expected blood glucose values for them.
Expected blood glucose levels for people without diabetes:
Time Range (mg/dL) Range (mmol/L)
Before Breakfast: 70-105 3.9-5.8
Before lunch or dinner: 70-110 3.9-6.1
1 hour after meals: Less than 160 Less than 8.9
2 hours after meals: Less than 120 Less than 6.7
Between 2 and 4 AM: Greater than 70 Greater than 3.9
Blood glucose levels can appear to be lower or higher after a meal, physical exercise or
any other event that may affect blood glucose levels. Before taking the EASYGLUCO™
blood glucose test, wait two hours prior or after a meal, physical exercise to retrieve more
accurate results.
• If the test result is below 20mg/dL (1.2mmol/L), “LO” will appear on the meter display.
“LO” results indicate severe hypoglycemia (low blood glucose). Consult with your
physician immediately in how to treat hypoglycemia.

• If the test result is above 600mg/dL (33.3mmol/L), “HI” will appear on the meter
display. “HI” results indicate severe hyperglycemia (high blood glucose). Seek medical
assistance immediately.
IMPORTANT Notices:
• If the test result is below 60mg/dL (3.3mmol/L) or over 240mg/dL (13.3mmol/L) contact
your physician immediately.
• If the blood glucose result is unusually low or high, or you do not feel the way the result
indicates, repeat the test again with a new test strip.
• If the results are still inconsistent, contact a physician before making any decision to
control your diabetes.

N. Instrument Name:
US Diagnostics Inc. EasyGluco Diabetes Monitoring System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The EasyGluco Diabetes Monitoring System used with the EasyGluco Reagent Strips and
EasyGluco Control Solution is a single use test system used to quantitatively measure
blood glucose levels, also known as blood sugar, from fresh capillary whole blood
samples taken from the fingertips, arm, palm, and thigh. The EasyGluco Diabetes
Monitoring System is for in vitro diagnostic use only. The EasyGluco Diabetes
Monitoring System is not intended for use with neonates.
2. Software:

this line of product types:
Yes __X______ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
The EasyGluco Blood Glucose Monitoring System memory will store from 7 to 90-day
average and 200 tests in the memory.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Refer to the EasyGluco Blood Glucose Monitoring System User’s Manual.
5. Calibration:
Code numbers are used to calibrate the EasyGluco Test Strips with the EasyGluco Meter
for accurate results. The operator must confirm the code number of the meter and test
strips are the same before using the meter. Once the EasyGluco test strip is inserted in the
EasyGluco meter, the meter will turn on and the code number will be displayed for 3
seconds. The operator will then compare the code number on the meter LCD to the code
number on the test strip vial.
If the codes do not match the operator must change the meter code to match the test strip
vial code. The test strips are tested at the manufacturer at the time they are released.
Based on performance characteristics for each lot of strips they are assigned code
numbers. These code numbers represent the slope and intercept characteristics for each of
the lots. The code number is embedded in reagent test strip.
6. Quality Control:
There are three EasyGluco Controls Solutions available: low, normal, and high that
correspond to whole blood glucose concentrations of approximately 50 ± 15mg/dL, 100 ±
16.5 mg/dL , and 300 ± 45 mg/dL respectively. A control test, using an EasyGluco
Control, can be used to check the meter and test strips performance. The meter test strips
and testing technique are acceptable if the control test result falls within a specific control
range. Users are instructed to follow the illustrated directions in the EasyGluco User
Guide. Quality control testing should be performed as required by the user’s institution’s
quality control policy or local regulatory requirements.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
