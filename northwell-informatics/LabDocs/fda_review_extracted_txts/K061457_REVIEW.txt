Rapid™ Drug Screening Propoxyphene Test are rapid, qualitative, competitive
binding immunoassays for the detection of Tricyclic Antidepressants,
Propoxyphene and their metabolites in human urine at the following cutoff levels:
Test Calibrator Cut-off
Tricyclic Antidepressant Nortriptyline 1000 ng/mL
Propoxyphene Propoxyphene 300 ng/mL
The tests provide only preliminary data, which should be confirmed by other
methods such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The test
configuration comes with either single drug test or in combination with multiple
other drug tests. Clinical considerations and professional judgment should be
applied to any drug of abuse test results, particularly when preliminary positive
results are indicated. The tests are not intended to be used in monitoring drug
levels.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable (N/A)
I. Device Description:
The UCP™ Drug Screening Tricyclic Antidepressants and Propoxyphene test are
both lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays that contain two test formats, a
dipstick test strip and a cassette test card format. The dipstick test strip format is
initiated by dipping the test strip into urine. The cassette test device uses the same
principle however urine is added to a sample well of a cassette.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
ACON TCA One Step Tricyclic Antidepressant Test Strip and Device
Instant-View Propoxyphene Urine Test and Cassette.
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
k021526 and k022915, respectively.
3. Comparison with predicate:
2

--- Page 3 ---
The device is similar to the predicates in that they measure the same analyte in the
same matrix, have the same intended use, utilize the same test methodology and
cutoff concentrations. There were no differences noted.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None Referenced
L. Test Principle:
The UCP Rapid Drug Screening Tricyclic Antidepressants and Propoxyphene Test
Devices and Strips are one-step lateral flow immunoassays containing 1) a purple-
colored conjugate pad with colloidal gold conjugated with anti-drug antibodies, 2) a
nitrocellulose membrane with a test line (T line coated with the drug antigen) and a
control line (C line coated with goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies). The test is a
competitive binding immunoassay in which drugs and drug metabolites in a urine
sample compete with immobilized drug conjugate for limited labeled antibody
binging sites. The test devices are cassettes that allow for urine to be added and the
urine migrates through the test device by capillary action. The test strips are dipped
into urine specimens and the urine migrates through the test strip by capillary action.
If the drug or drug metabolite concentration in the specimen is below the cutoff level,
the anti-drug antibodies in colloidal gold particles will bind to the drug antigens
coated in the test line of the nitrocellulose membrane to form a T line, which indicates
a negative result. If the concentration of drug in the urine specimen is at a cutoff
level or higher, it will bind with antibodies conjugated with colloidal gold particles,
so that no T line will develop in the test region, which indicates a positive result. The
colloidal gold-antibody conjugate should bind to the C line and form a purple-colored
and regardless of the presence of drug or drug metabolite in the urine specimen as
long as a sufficient sample volume has been applied.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was assessed for both TCA and Propoxyphene by conducting a
within lot and a lot-to-lot precision study. The lot-to-lot precision study used
drug free human urine spiked with commercially available drug standards that
produced concentrations of -50% cutoff, -25% cutoff, the cutoff, +25% cutoff
and +50% cutoff. The samples were tested with 3 lots of each assay device by
three operators over a period of 10 days (N=60). Two operators are trained
laboratory workers and one is professional with limited laboratory
background. The results are presented in the charts below.

In order to show that both formats of the device (strips and cassette) are
equivalent in readability, and additional bridging study was conducted.
Normal drug free urine was spiked with commercially available drug standard
to the same levels indicated in the charts above. Twenty UCP test strips and
20 UCP cassette devices from the same lots were tested and summarized in

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable (N/A). This assay is intended for qualitative use.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device has internal process controls. A colored line appearing in the
control region confirms that sufficient sample volume has been used. Users
are informed not to interpret the test if a colored line failed to appear in the
control region.
External controls are not supplied with this device.
d. Detection limit:
Sensitivity of the UCP Rapid Drug Screening Tests was characterized by
validating the test performance around the claimed cutoff concentrations. The
results support the sponsors chosen cutoffs of 1000 ng/mL for TCA and 300
for propoxyphene. See the Precision section above for additional information
regarding test performance around the cutoff.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was evaluated by spiking various concentrations of similarly
structured drug compounds into drug-free urine/a negative control. The
sponsored determined the concentration of the drug that produced a response
approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay (1000 ng/mL
for TCA and 300 for propoxyphene). The cross-reactivity results are listed in
the table below.

The sponsor tested many common substances and biological materials for
interference with the UCP Rapid Drug Screening Tests at a concentration of
100 mg/mL in drug-free and drug positive urines. The sponsor states that they
was no cross-reactivity detected. The compounds are listed in the package
insert.
The sponsor evaluated urine pH for test interference in negative urine
specimens and in specimens with concentrations of 50% above the cutoff.
The specimens were adjusted to pH ranges from 4.5 to 9. The testing results
were summarized in the tables below. The results showed that there was no
interference from urine pH ranging from 4.5 to 9 with either the TCA or the
PPX test.

50% above the cutoff. The specific gravity values ranged from 1.002 to 1.035.

TCA and propoxyphene tests.

f. Assay cut-off:
The identified cutoff concentrations of the assays are commonly found in
industry. There are no recommended cutoffs for these assays by the
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).
TCA has a cutoff of 1000 ng/mL and propoxyphene has a cutoff of 300
ng/mL.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The UCP Rapid Drug Screening TCA and PPX Tests were compared to the
predicate devices and reference methods. The TCA test was compared to
HPLC and the PPX was compared to the GC/MS reference method. One
hundred and forty (140) clinical urine samples containing drug free urine (52),
nortriptyline (48), amitriptyline (16), imipramine (10), desipramine (10) and
Nortriptyline/Amitriptyline combined (4) were tested by the predicate devices
and on the reference methods at the sponsor’s facility. Thirteen percent of the
clinical urine samples contained drug concentrations between 50% below the
cutoff and the cutoff for each drug tested. Another thirteen percent of the
clinical urine samples contained drug concentrations between the cutoff and
50% above the cutoff for each drug tested.
