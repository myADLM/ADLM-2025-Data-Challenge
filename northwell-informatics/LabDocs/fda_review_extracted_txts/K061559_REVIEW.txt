K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were identified by the applicant.
L. Test Principle:
Glucose: This test is based on the enzymatic reaction that occurs between glucose
oxidase, peroxidase and chromogen. Glucose if first oxidized to produce gluconic
acid and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of glucose oxidase. The hydrogen
peroxide reacts with potassium iodide chromogen in the presence of peroxidase. The
extent to which the chromogen is oxidized determines the color which is produced,
ranging from green to brown. Low amounts of glucose are normally excreted in urine.
Glucose concentrations as low as 100 mg/dL, read at either 10 or 30 seconds, may be
considered abnormal if results are consistent. At 10 seconds, results should be
interpreted qualitatively. For semi-quantitative results, read at 30 seconds only.
Bilirubin: This test is based on azo-coupling reaction of bilirubin with diazotized
dichloroaniline in a strongly acidic medium. Varying bilirubin levels will produce a
pinkish-tan color proportional to its concentration in urine. In normal urine, no
bilirubin is detectable by even the most sensitive methods. Even trace amounts of
bilirubin require further investigation. Atypical results (colors different from the
negative or positive color blocks shown on the color chart) may indicate that
bilirubin-derived bile pigments are present in the urine specimen, and are possibly
masking the bilirubin reaction.
Ketone: This test is based on ketones reacting with nitroprusside and acetoacetic acid
to produce a color change ranging from light pink for negative results to a darker pink
or purple color for positive results. Ketones are normally not present in urine.
Detectable ketone levels may occur in urine during physiological stress conditions
such as fasting, pregnancy and frequent strenuous exercise. In starvation diets, or in
other abnormal carbohydrate metabolism situations, ketones appear in the urine in
excessively high concentration before serum ketones are elevated.
Specific Gravity: This test is based on the apparent pKa change of certain pretreated
polyelectrolytes in relation to ionic concentration. In the presence of an indicator,

colors range from deep blue-green in urine of low ionic concentration to green and
yellow-green in urine of increasing ionic concentration. Randomly collected urine
may vary in specific gravity from 1.003-1.035. Twenty-four hour urine from healthy
adults with normal diets and fluid intake will have a specific gravity of 1.016-1.022.
In cases of severe renal damage, the specific gravity is fixed at 1.010, the value of the
glomerular filtrate.
Blood: This test is based on the peroxidase-like activity of hemoglobin which
catalyzes the reaction of cumene-hydroperoxide and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine.
The resulting color ranges from orange to green to dark blue. Any green spots or
green color development on the reagent area within 60 seconds is significant and the
urine specimen should be examined further. Blood is often, but not invariably, found
in the urine of menstruating females.
pH: This test is based on a double indicator system which gives a broad range of
colors covering the entire urinary pH range. Colors range from orange to yellow and
green to blue. The expected range for normal urine specimens from newborns is pH
5-7. The expected range for other normal urine specimens is pH 4.5-8, with an
average result of pH 6.
Protein: This reaction is based on the phenomenon known as the "protein error” of pH
indicators where an indicator that is highly buffered will change color in the presence
of proteins (anions) as the indicator releases hydrogen ions to the protein. At a
constant pH, the development of any green color is due to the presence of protein.
Colors range from yellow to yellow-green for negative results and green to green-blue
for positive results. 1-14 mg/dL of protein may be excreted by a normal kidney. A
color matching any block greater than trace indicates significant proteinuria.
Urobilinogen: This test is based on a modified Ehrlich reaction between p-
diethylaminobenzaldehyde and urobilinogen acid in strongly acidic medium to
produce a pink color. Urobilinogen is one of the major compounds produced in heme
this test is 0.2-1.0 mg/dL (3.5-17 μmol/L). A result of 2.0 mg/dL (35 μmol/L) may be
of clinical significance, and the patient specimen should be further evaluated.
Nitrite: This test depends upon the conversion of nitrate to nitrite by the action of
Gram negative bacteria in the urine. In an acidic medium, nitrite in the urine reacts
with p-arsanilic acid to form a diazonium compound. The diazonium compound in
turn couples with 1 N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine to produce a pink color. Nitrite is
not detectable in normal urine. The nitrite area will be positive in some cases of
infection, depending on how long the urine specimens were retained in the bladder
prior to collection. Retrieval of positive cases with the nitrite test ranges from as low
as 40% in cases where little bladder incubation occurred, to as high as approximately
80% in cases where bladder incubation took place for at least 4 hours.
Leukocytes: This test reveals the presence of granulocyte esterases. The esterases
cleave a derivatized pyrazole amino acid ester to liberate derivatized hydroxy
5

--- Page 6 ---
pyrazole. This pyrazole then reacts with a diazonium salt to produce a beige-pink to
purple color. Normal urine specimens generally yield negative results. Trace results
may be of questionable clinical significance. When trace results occur, it is
recommended to retest using a fresh specimen from the same patient. Repeated trace
and positive results are of clinical significance.
Ascorbic acid: This test involves decolorization of Tillmann’s reagent. The presence
of ascorbic acid causes the color of the test field to change from blue-green to orange.

Three lots of the ACON Urinalysis Reagent Strips were used. Tests in
duplicates were performed with 10 repeats by 5 operators per day for 10 days.
A total of 3,000 strips were used for testing (3 x 2 x 10 x 5 x 10 = 3,000
strips). Results were read by comparing color reaction to the color blocks on
the canister label according to the instructions on the package insert. The
results indicate that the values obtained were all within the expected values for
the control materials.
As the urinalysis controls did not have an ascorbic acid level, the sponsor used
two ascorbic acid standard positive solutions, 10 mg/dL and 20 mg/dL.
Testing was performed according to the package insert and the results were
determined by visually comparing the reaction colors with the color chart. The
ACON Urinalysis Reagent Strips from 3 lots were used and tests were
performed in replicates of 10 for 2 runs by 10 operators per day for 10 days.
The results indicate that the values obtained were all within the expected
values for the control materials.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor did not indicate any degree of traceability for their devices.
Control materials are not specifically identified in the labeling, but the sponsor
indicates in the labeling that for best results, performance of reagent strips
should be confirmed by testing known positive and negative
specimens/controls whenever a new test is performed, or whenever a new
canister is first opened.
The recommended storage temperature range for the ACON Urinalysis
Reagent Strips is between 2 – 30°C. Opened canister stability claim of the
strips is that the strips are stable for at least 3 months. Unopened canister
stability claim of the strips is that the strips are stable for 24 months from the
date of manufacture.
d. Detection limit:
The sensitivity of the assay was validated by spiking positive urine samples of
known concentrations for each analyte. These positive samples of each
analyte were then diluted to the lowest “positive” concentrations indicated on
the ACON color chart. For each analyte, aliquots of the lowest positive
samples were further diluted to 4:1 or 80%, 3:2 or 60%, 1:1 or 50% and 1:3 or
25% of the originals with negative urine. Urine samples including negative
and all spiked and diluted samples were then tested with three lots of the
ACON Urinalysis Reagent Strips. For three consecutive days, each sample
was tested 21 times by three operators (7 strips per operator per day). A total
of 189 strips were used for each concentration tested (3 operators x 3 days x 7
strips x 3 lots = 189 strips). The minimum sensitivity level for each analyte of
the ACON Urinalysis Reagent Strips is defined by the sponsor as the lowest
level at which over 67% (2/3) of the test results are positive when the diluted
positive samples for an analyte of known concentrations were tested. The
results of each analyte sensitivity pad are summarized below. Gray blocks
identify the low range (sensitivity) of each analyte.

The sponsor also performed interference studies that were analytes that the urinalysis
strips detect in order to determine if an analyte is detected by the strip is abnormally
high will it affect the results of other test pads on the strip. Urine samples were
spiked with different analytes to the known concentrations which were then
confirmed as positive urine samples by Bayer Multistix 10 SG Reagent Strips
and Clinitek Status Analyzer. These positive urine samples were then spiked
with possible interfering substances, one at a time to the levels listed in the
following tables. The urine samples were tested with the ACON Urinalysis
Reagent Strips in 5 replicates. Results were read by comparing color reaction

The sponsor also examined the effect of excess urine sample “runover”
phenomenon between pH and Protein pads when the excess urine was not
removed immediately. The pH standard solutions, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 and 9.0,
prepared with fresh negative urine were used in the study.
Testing protocol #1: Dip the ACON Urinalysis Reagent Strips into standard
urine solutions and take out immediately, remove excess urine from the strips
right away according to the package insert. Read results in the scheduled time.
Tests were repeated 10 times for each solution.
Testing protocol #2: Dip the strips into standard urine solutions and take out
immediately, did not remove excess urine from the strips. Read results in the

From the testing results, if the excess urine was not removed immediately, the
edge of pH reagent pad became red as the result of the acidic component
runover from the Protein pad onto the pH pad.
The sponsor also indicates that urinalysis reagent strips may be affected by
substances that cause abnormal urine color such as drugs containing azo dyes
(e.g. Pyridium® , Azo Gantrisin® , Azo Gantanol® ), nitrofurantoin
(Microdantin® , Furadantin®), and riboflavin. The color development on the
test pad may be masked or a color reaction may be produced that could be
interpreted as false results. In addition, the sensitivity of the Nitrite pad is
reduced for urine specimens with highly buffered alkaline (e.g. Sodium
Bicarbonate).
