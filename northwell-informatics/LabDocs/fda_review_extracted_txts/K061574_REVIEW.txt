510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
K061574
B. Purpose for Submission:
To obtain clearance for a labeling modification to the COULTER LH 750
Hematology Analyzer to reflect a revised MCV accuracy specification.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Beckman Coulter, Inc.
COULTER LH 750 Hematology Analyzer
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Automated differential cell counter
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The COULTER LH 750 is an automated hematology analyzer capable of
supplying a complete blood cells analysis and includes a differential leukocyte
cell count. The product also provides automated reticulocyte analysis and
enumeration of nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) as well as an automated
method for the enumeration of RBCs and WBCs in body fluids.
2. Principles of Operation:
The COULTER LH 750 Hematology Analyzer utilizes the Coulter Principle for
enumerating and sizing blood cells, automatic diluting and mixing for sample
processing and a sing beam photometer for hemoglobinometry. It used
COULTER VCS (volume, conductivity, light scatter) technology for WBC
Differential analysis and classification and reticulocyte analysis. The analyzer
uses a reagent system consisting of an isotonic diluent, lytic reagents to lyse the
red cells without significantly affecting the white cells and an instrument cleaner.
All systems include reagents used for reticulocyte staining and analysis.

For body fluids analysis, the specimen is aspirated into the LH 750 Analyzer via
the manual mode and is diluted in separate WBC and RBC baths. The Coulter
Method of counting cells is used to detect and measure changes in electrical
resistance when a cell, suspended in a conductive diluent, passes through a small
aperture. Each suspended cell acts as an insulator. As the cell passes through the
aperture, it momentarily increases the resistance of the electrical path between
two submerged electrodes, one located on each side of the aperture. The
resistance generates an electrical pulse. The accumulation of electrical pulses are
channelized, processed for coincidence correction, and multiplied by a calibration
factor, yielding the WBC and RBC counts. The WBC result represents the TNC
(total nucleated cell count) in the analysis of body fluids.
