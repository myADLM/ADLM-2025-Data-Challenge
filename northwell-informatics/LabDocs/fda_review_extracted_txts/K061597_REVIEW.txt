I. Device Description:
The EPOC Blood Analysis System consists of three (3) components:
1. EPOC Test Card
The single use blood test card comprises a port for introduction of a blood sample
to an array of sensors on a sensor module. The sensor module is mounted
proximal to a fluidic channel contained in a credit-card sized housing. The card
has an on-board calibrator contained in a sealed reservoir fluidically connected to
the senor array through a valve.
2. EPOC Card Reader
The reader is a minimally featured raw-signal acquisition peripheral. The reader
comprises a card orifice for accepting a test card, and a mechanical actuation
assembly for engaging the test card after it is inserted into the card orifice. Within
the reader’s card orifice there is a bar code scanner, an electrical contact array for
contacting the card’s sensor module, and a thermal subsystem for heating the
card’s measurement region to 37oC during the test. The reader also comprises
circuits for amplifying, digitizing and converting the raw sensor signals to a
wireless transmittable Bluetooth format,
3. EPOC Host
The host is a dedicated use Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) computing device
2

L. Test Principle:
There are three types of sensor measurements used in the EPOC BGE test card –
potentiometric, amperometric and conductimetric.
In potentiometry, (for sodium, potassium, ionized calcium, pH and pCO2) the open
circuit potential of a membrane coated sensor electrode (which is responsive to the
concentration of the analyte) is measured versus a reference electrode (which is non-
responsive). The measurement is performed by a high input impedance operational
amplifier in the card reader connected to each of the electrode pairs comprising
sensor electrode and reference electrode.
In amperometry (for pO2) the current, i, flowing through a membrane-coated
amperometric indicator electrode to the ground electrode is measured, when the
indicator electrode is poised at a fixed potential versus the reference electrode.
Hematocrit is measured by ac conductimetry. A pair of spaced apart electrodes in the
flow channel is use to minimized contact impedance and blood cell settling errors.
The down-stream conductivity-high electrode also serves as the detector for adequate
sample volume delivery. The measurement employs a 20 kHz voltage source with

Whole blood
Whole blood test materials were prepared from fresh blood drawn into a green
top heparinized vacuum collection tube from a Company volunteer in the
morning on each test day. The normal blood sample (nb), as collected,
comprised the first test material. A spiked blood sample (sb) was tonometered
and electrolyte spiked to an elevated analyte level for the second test material.

The data indicates that the whole blood imprecision data are consistent with
the aqueous imprecision data.
Supplemental field trial data acquired at one hospital at three different POC
sites: the cardiac ICU, the medical ICU and the Neonatal ICU. From these
sites various operators who perform POC testing on the predicate device were
chosen for inclusion in the study. The study included 2 nurses, 2 RT’s and 3
nurses’ assistants.
The following protocol was used. After a training period each POC operator
was asked to run 10 replicates of a whole blood patient sample. A different
sample was used for each precision study. There were 5 readers in operation
for each precision study, 2 test replicates being run per each of 5 readers for a
total of 10 replicates.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibration of the EPOC system is performed using both primary and
secondary NIST traceable standards.
For calibration of blood gases multiple blood samples are obtained. These are
prepared by tonometry to various analytical levels spanning the reportable
range. To establish proper calibration for gases, the analytical values from the
EPOC system are compared with both the tonometry value (using gas
compositions traceable to NIST standards) and the value obtained from two
commercially available blood gas and electrolyte instruments in routine use
in the clinical laboratory. Each instrument itself is calibrated with NIST
traceable gas mixtures.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit is defined as the lower limit of the linearity.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed to demonstrate the specificity of the EPOC
measurements.
The following protocol was used. A normal whole blood sample (collected
into a heparinized green top vacuum collection tube) was divided into two
equal volume aliquots, each aliquot then spun down. A spiking solution of the
test interference was prepared in aqueous solution and added into the plasma
of the first aliquot, at 25μL of spiking solution per mL of plasma. The second
plasma aliquot was spiked with the aqueous spiking solution containing no
test interference (blank control), also at 25μL per mL of plasma. The
concentration of the test interference in the spiking solution was calculated to
achieve the desired test level when diluted into the plasma. After spiking, the
plasma and blood cells were reconstituted. In some cases where the test
interference was only sparingly soluble in aqueous solution or where it was
slow to fully dissolve, ethanol spike solutions instead of aqueous were used.
Interference test levels were those recommended by the CLSI guideline (CLSI
EP7-A).
The applicant measured the spiked blood and the blank on the EPOC system,
each plasma sample measured six times, as well as on an in-house reference

instrument. In most cases six replicates was sufficient to resolve the bias.
Where resolution was insufficient replicates were added. Two EPOC readers
were used. In the first round the applicant measured A (the test blood) on
reader 1 and B (the blank) on reader 2 at the same time, and A then B on the
reference instrument also at the same time. In the second round the applicant
measured B on reader 1 and A on reader 2 and B then A on the reference
instrument, all at the same time. Six rounds in total were performed, reversing
the AB order in each round. The applicant computed the bias between test and
blank as the mean of each AB difference from the six rounds. If the AB
difference was systematically changing from round to round (because the
analyte value was changing over time differently in the test blood and the
control, the applicant computed the difference between the EPOC AB pairs
and the AB pairs from the reference instrument for each round.
In most cases the interference could be established directly from the test
minus control result. In some cases where the addition caused changes in both
test and control that were in addition to interference effects, or where the
samples where unstable over time, the applicant computed the test minus
control versus the test minus control for a reference instrument known not to
have an interference, then compared the result against the reference
instrument result as the control and used that value.
The table below shows the random error, RE, of each method, expressed
either as a standard deviation or a coefficient of variation (CV%). SDdiff =
1.4RE is the standard deviation of the difference between a pair of
measurements. The 95% confidence limit of the mean difference of 6
replicates is given by . This is the value of measured bias due to

interference, b, which can be resolved as being different from zero with 95%
confidence. b/TE is the resolvable bias expressed as a fraction of the total
allowable error. SEc = TE - 1.65RE is the critical systematic error which
results in a medically significant error more than 5% of the time. SEc/TE is
the critical systematic error expressed as a fraction of the total allowable error.

hospital site, additional data were collected on patient samples spiked with
sodium and calcium. Spiked samples were used for range testing of the EPOC
device to validate that the EPOC sensors were operating to specification
across a larger data range than is usually encountered in clinical trials for

sodium and calcium These analytes, in particular sodium, exhibit a narrow
range in patient samples, even in large studies with over 100 patient samples.
To obtain R>0.9 in method comparison studies the patient data were
supplemented with spiked samples. Additionally some method comparison
data on samples with potassium and pH spikes were added. Samples for
range-testing were whole blood specimens collected in green top vacuum
collection tubes with normal range values for these analytes, which were then
adjusted to elevated calcium, sodium and potassium values by spiking with
the chloride salts of those ions, and elevated pH by spiking with NaOH.
