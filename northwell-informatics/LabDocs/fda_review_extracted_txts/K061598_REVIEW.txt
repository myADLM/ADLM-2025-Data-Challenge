L. Test Principle:
Homocysteine levels in patient plasma are measured automatically on IL Coagulation
Systems in three stages:
1. Reduction of mixed disulfides and protein-bound forms of Hcy present in the
plasma samples to free Hcy.
2. Enzymatic conversion of free Hcy to S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) by the
SAH hydrolase (SAHH) in the presence of an excess of adenosine.
3. Competitive agglutination reaction between anti-SAH and SAH/conjugate.
The degree of agglutination is inversely proportional to the concentration of total Hcy
in the sample and is determined by measuring the decrease of transmitted light caused
by the aggregates.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed using a plasma sample and controls.
Samples were run in duplicate twice a day for 20 days on three different
instruments following the CSLI EP5-A Guidelines. Mean, SD, and CVs were
calculated and all samples had CV less than 10 % for within run, between day
and total precision. The acceptance criteria are ≤ 10 % for within run,
between day and total precision.
ACL TOP Mean CV% CV%
(µmol/L) (Within run) (Total)
Hcy Control Level 1 11.4 2.0 4.8
Hcy Control Level 2 22.4 1.5 3.5
Hcy plasma sample 8.1 2.9 5.5
ACL 9000 Mean CV% CV%

ACL Futura Mean CV% CV%
(µmol/L) (Within run) (Total)
Hcy Control Level 1 10.5 3.5 6.0
Hcy Control Level 2 21.1 2.6 3.5
Hcy plasma sample 7.9 3.5 5.6
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
i) Regular test (Without Rerun)
A linear study was performed using three different instruments, ACL
Futura, ACL 9000, and ACL TOP. The Homocysteine calibrator was
diluted and analyzed in replicates of five with two different lots of HCY
kits. The test was considered linear if the CV < 20% and the recovery
within ± 20% of the target value and the following acceptance criteria
were met:
Slope of 0.9-1.1; R2 ≥ 0.96; and Intercept of 0.0 ± Detection Limit
This test has a linear range of 4.5-30 µmol/L without rerun.
ii) Regular test (With Rerun)
A linear study was performed using three different instruments, ACL
Futura, ACL 9000, and ACL TOP to verify that the Hcy level in citrated
plasma samples can be accurately recovered when the samples are diluted.
A plasma sample containing approximately 60 µmol/L of Hcy was diluted
to different dilution with both the kit Buffer and with a human plasma
sample with low Hcy concentration. Each dilution was analyzed in
quadruplicate using two different lots of Hcy kits with and without rerun.
Samples above 30 µmol/L were automatically diluted by the rerun
capability of the instrument. The test was considered linear if the CV <
20% and the recovery within ± 20% of the target value and the following
acceptance criteria were met:
Slope of 0.9-1.1; R2 ≥ 0.96; and Intercept of 0.0 ± Detection Limit
This test has a linear range of 4.5-60 µmol/L with rerun.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The HemosIL Homocysteine calibrator is traceable to an Internal Reference
Standard that was prepared gravimetrically with S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine
(SAH) in phosphate buffer. A 5000 µmol/L Homocysteine Reference Stock
concentrate was prepared by gravimetrically adding S-adenosyl-L-
homocysteine (SAH) to Calibrator Diluent. The Homocysteine assay is
calibrated using the Calibrator included as a component of the kit.
The reconstituted controls stability testing was performed at several intervals
and for temperature stored at 15-25oC , 2-8oC, and -20oC. The data supported
6

--- Page 7 ---
the reconstituted controls stability of 7 days at 15-25oC, 2 months at 2-8 oC,
and 1 month at -20oC.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limits were established by running twenty replicates of the
Buffer with two different lots of Hcy kits on three different instruments, ACL
Futura,ACL 9000 and ACL TOP . For each reagent lot on each instrument
platform, the mean, SD, and mean + 3SD were calculated. The highest
calculated value for all the instrument platforms was used to establish the
detection limit claims of 2.4 µmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was performed by spiking two citrated plasma samples
containing approximately 8 and 15 µmol/L of Hcy with the kit buffer and the
other with 20 times more concentrated interfering substance. Study was
performed on ACL Futura, ACL 9000, and ACL TOP. No significant
interference if the % recovery was within ± 15% of the expected control
result.
There was no significant interference by the following interferents:
• Hemoglobin up to 490 mg/dL
• Bilirubin up to 19 mg/dL
• Triglycerides up to 1325 mg/dL
• Rheumatoid Factor up to 480 IU/mL
• Sodium Fluoride up to 4.0 g/L
A cross-reactivity study was performed using normal plasma samples spiked
with the following concentrations and results were summarized in the
following table:
Compound Assayed % cross reactivity
concentration
L-Cysteine 5 mmol/L 0.0 %
Adenosine 1 mmol/L 0.2 %
L-Methionine 0.4 mmol/L -0.2 %
L-Cystathionine 2 mmol/L 0.1 %
S-Adenosyl-L-methionine 0.5 mmol/L 2.6 %
DL-Homocysteine-thiolactone 0.1 mmol/L 4.7 %
Glutathione 100 mmol/L 0.0%
As limitations, the applicant stated the followings in the package insert:

1. Specimens from patients who are on drug therapy involving S-adenosy-
methionine may show falsely elevated levels of homcysteine. Patients
who are taking methotrexate, carbamazepine, phenytoin, nitrous oxide,
anticonvulsants, or 6-azuridine triacetate, may have elevated levels of
homocysteine due to their effect on the pathway.
2. Specimens from patients who have received preparation of mouse
monoclonal antibody for diagnosis or therapy may contain human anti-
mouse antibody (HAMA). HAMA present in serum or plasma specimens
may interfere in immunoassays that utilize mouse monoclonal antibodies.
These specimens should not be assayed in the Hcy assay.

Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was conducted in Italy, using 76 paired sodium
citrate and EDTA patient plasma samples analyzed in duplicate using
HemosIL Homocysteine on an ACL 9000(sodium citrate plasma) verses IMx
Homocysteine (EDTA plasma). Samples ranged in Homocysteine values
from 4.3 to 56.7 µmol/L.
The slope and intercept were calculated by Passing & Bablock and the
correlation coefficient by Pearson. Correlation regression yielded: y= 0.829x
+ 0.350, r = 0.9915. Y= ACL 9000(sodium citrate plasma), X= IMx (EDTA
plasma). All criteria met the applicant’s acceptable criteria of: Slope=0.80-
1.20, R2≥0.950, Intercept= 0.0± Detection limit.
b. Matrix comparison between the Citrated and EDTA plasma on the ACL TOP:
A correlation study was conducted using 139 paired sodium citrate and EDTA
patient plasma samples analyzed in duplicate on an ACL TOP using HemosIL
Homocysteine. Samples ranged in Homocysteine values from 5.5 to 34.4
µmol/L.
The slope and intercept were calculated by Passing & Bablock and the
correlation coefficient by Pearson. The performance of citrated versus EDTA
plasma is substantially equivalent, although there was an average bias of
15.2% between the sample types. Correlation regression yielded: y= 0.799x +
0.406, r = 0.9939. Y= Citrate plasma, X= EDTA plasma.
c. Instruments equivalent studies between ACL 9000 verses ACL Futura and ACL
TOP:
A method comparison study was performed to compare the performance of
HemosIL Homocysteine on the representative instrument platforms. 117

citrated plasma samples were tested on an ACL 9000, ACL Futura, and ACL
TOP. Samples tested ranged from 7.9 to 69.9 µmol/L. The statistical analysis
by Passing & Bablok regression yielded the following results.
1. ACL 9000 vs ACL Futura, y=0.9458 x + 0.0149, r = 0.99. x = ACL 9000,
y = ACL Futura
2. ACL 9000 vs ACL TOP, y=0.9780 x + 0.2943, r = 0.99. x = ACL 9000,

5. Expected values/Reference range:
One hundred forty (140) citrated plasma samples, 50 males and 90 females, were
from apparently healthy blood bank donors in Barcelona, Spain were tested in
duplicate using HemosIL Homocysteine on an ACL Futura, ACL 9000, and ACL
TOP. One (4) sample was removed as a far outlier (criteria: 3 inter-quartile
ranges above the mean) and was not used in the final calculations, bringing the
final total to n=136. The distribution was normal (parametric) and therefore,
parametric statistics were applied. The 95% reference interval limit with a
confidence interval of 90% for each instrument platform is listed as below:
ACL Futura/ACL Advance: 4.1-10.6 µmol/L
ACL ELITE/ELITE PRO/8/9/10000: 4.0-11.2 µmol/L
ACL TOP: 4.3-11.1 µmol/L
ACL Advance is in the same family as the ACL Futura. ACL ELITE, ELITE
PRO, ACL 8000 and ACL 10000 are in the same family as the ACL 9000.
