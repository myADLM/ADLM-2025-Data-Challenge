510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
K061602
B. Purpose for Submission:
Addition to the BioView Duet System of fluorescence in situ hybridization
enumeration of the HER-2/neu gene for human breast cancer specimens
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
BioView Ltd.
Duet™ System
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Automated fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) enumeration of the HER-2/neu
gene in human breast cancer specimens
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Duet system is an automated scanning microscope and image analysis system.
The Duet System workstation integrates a microscope, CCD camera, motorized stage,
computer, keyboard, mouse, joystick, monitor and a dedicated software program.
The Duet System scans cell samples in high resolution and in full color at high speed
both in bright light and fluorescent illumination. The Duet System suggests
classification of the cells according to their morphological features, their staining and
fluorescent signals and allows the user to quickly examine the results, correct them as
needed and generate a report summarizing the sample’s data. The unique feature of
the Duet System allows the combined presentation of morphological and specific
staining information of the same cell, for all the cells of the sample.
This particular application of the Duet system involves detection and quantification of
chromosome 17 and the HER-2/neu gene via fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) in interphase nuclei from formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded human breast
cancer tissue specimens probed by the Vysis® PathVysion™ HER-2 DNA Probe kit.

2. Principles of Operation:
Samples are prepared according the instructions for the Vysis® PathVysion™ HER-2
DNA Probe kit. The user selects the appropriate areas for analysis in accordance with
the PathVysion™ kit instructions. The Duet System automatically captures images
for each of the selected areas and the automatic algorithm detects and enumerates the
fluorescent signals. The user reviews the signal enumeration for all relevant cells and
the results (total number of cells and overall signal ratio) are automatically calculated
by the system.
There is no change in the system hardware from the previously cleared system.
Software changes were implement to support the new indication for use for HER-
2/neu FISH automated enumeration. The device methodology is well established.
3. Modes of Operation:
Semi-automated computer assisted interpretation
4. Specimen Identification:
Rack/positioning
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimens are formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded human breast cancer tissue
specimens probed for via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in interphase
nuclei by the Vysis® PathVysion™ HER-2 DNA Probe kit
6. Calibration:
The system requires periodic calibration which should be performed only by
BioView authorized personnel.
7. Quality Control:
Control slides are prepared and run concurrently with patient slides according to
the PathVysion™ Kit instructions. The control slides are tested on the Duet™
System according to the same procedure as patient slides. It is the responsibility
of the pathologist to assure the control slides meet quality acceptance criteria.

G. Intended Use:
1. Indication(s) for Use:
The Duet™ System is an automated scanning microscope and image analysis
system. It is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aiding tool to the
pathologist in the detection, classification and counting of cells of interest based
on color, intensity, size, pattern, and shape. The Duet™ System is intended to:
• Detect hematopoietic cells stained by Giemsa stain, immunohistochemistry or ISH
(with bright field and fluorescent) prepared from cell suspension.
• Detect amniotic cells stained by FISH (using direct labeled DNA probes for
chromosomes X, Y, 13, 18 and 21).
• Detect cells in urine specimens, stained by FISH (using the Vysis UroVysion™
Bladder Cancer Recurrence Kit for chromosomes 3, 7, 17 and 9p21 locus), from
subjects with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.
• Identify/detect and quantify chromosome 17 and the HER-2/neu gene via
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in interphase nuclei from formalin-fixed,
paraffin embedded human breast cancer tissue specimens, probed by the
Vysis®PathVision™ HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. The Duet™ is to be used as an
adjunctive automated enumeration tool, in conjunction with manual visualization, to
assist in determining HER-2/neu gene to chromosome 17 signal ratio.

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Method Comparison with Manual Method:
The substantial equivalence studies were based on comparison to conventional
manual microscopy performed in accordance with the Vysis PathVysion® HER-
2/neu DNA Probe kit.
The comparison study was conducted at four clinical sites. The study included a
total of 70 cases, consisting of 33 cases of normal (ratios < 1.5), 21 cases in the
“borderline” range (ratios between 1.5 and 2.5) and 16 cases of high amplification
(ratios >2.5). Ratios ≥ 2.0 were interpreted as “FISH positive” or amplification
present. Ratios < 2.0 were interpreted as “FISH negative” or no amplification.
For the manual method, the sites counted 20 cells and then calculated the average
HER-2/chromosome 17 ratios. If the result was between 1.8 and 2.2, another 20
cells were counted (as per the reagent package insert recommendation) and the
final ratio was based on the average from counting 40 cells. The same protocol
was followed for the Duet method (automated). If the Duet reported a ratio
between 1.8 and 2.2 with the first 20 cells, the operator was instructed to count
another 20 cells and then the final average calculation from the 40 cells was
reported.

Total agreement was found to be 99% (69/70) with 95% CI (92%, 100%).
Negative percent agreement is 100% (48/48), 95% CI (93%, 100%) and positive
percent agreement 96% (21/22), 95% CI (77%, 100%). The overall agreement as
measured by Kappa was 99%, 95% CI (90%, 100%).
b. Optimal Number of Fields of View:
Method comparison studies and reproducibility and repeatability studies above
were conducted using both 3 and 6 FOVs to evaluate the optimal performance of
the Duet System using a minimal number of FOVs. The correlation between
results obtained from the Duet System 3 and 6 FOV analyses revealed a
correlation of .996, with R-square = .993. In addition, the constant was near 0
(0.0084) and non-significant (t = 0.207, p = 0.836). Therefore, 3 FOV provides
results that are sufficient for the effective performance of the Duet System.
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
L. Conclusion:
1. The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
a substantial equivalence decision.
