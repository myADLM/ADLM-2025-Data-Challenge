Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Premarket Notifications for Automated

L. Test Principle:
CBC analysis is based on the established Coulter principle method of automated cell
counting and spectrophotometric hemoglobin determination. The Coulter method counts and
sizes cells by detecting and measuring changes in electrical resistance when a particle (such
as a cell) in a conductive liquid goes through a small aperture.
Each cell suspended in a conductive liquid (diluent) acts as an insulator. As each cell goes
through the aperture, it momentarily increases the resistance of the electrical path between
two submerged electrodes, one located on each side of the aperture. This causes an electrical
pulse that can be counted and sized. While the number of pulses indicates particle count, the
size of the electrical pulse is proportional to the cell volume.
Differential and reticulocyte analysis is based on the Coulter volume, conductivity and light
scatter technology (VCS). Differential analysis classification and reticulocyte analysis occur
in the flow cell, where: Low-frequency current measures volume; High-frequency current
senses cellular internal content through measuring changes in conductivity; Light from the
laser scattered off the individual cells characterizes cellular surface, shape, and reflectivity.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was performed in accordance with CLSI/NCCLS EP5-A2,
Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices; Approved
Guideline and Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Premarket
Notifications for Automated Differential Cell Counters for Immature or Abnormal
Blood Cells; Final Guidance for Industry and FDA. Acceptance criteria for each
parameter were the performance specifications described in the Draft on-Line Help
CD Rom, Section 13. Acceptance criteria were met.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed in accordance with Class II Special Controls
Guidance Document: Premarket Notifications for Automated Differential Cell
Counters for Immature or Abnormal Blood Cell Types; Final Guidance for Industry
and FDA. WBC, RBD, Hgb, and Plt linearity was evaluated by analyzing
gravimetrically prepared dilutions of whole blood and analog preparations to cover
the linear range. The values obtained were compared to the expected values for each
dilution. Acceptance criteria for each parameter were the performance specifications
described in the Draft on-Line Help CD Rom, Section 13. Acceptance criteria were
met.

Accuracy testing was performed in accordance with CLSI/NCCLS EP9-A, Method
Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples; Approved Guideline.
Normal and clinical samples were analyzed on the test instruments and compared
against a predicate device. Non-numeric and system alarms were excluded from data
analysis. Accuracy was performed for CBC, Diff, and Reticulocyte parameters,
results were compared to specifications. Acceptance criteria for each parameter were
the performance specifications described in the Draft on-Line Help CD Rom, Section
13. Acceptance criteria were met.
b. Matrix comparison:
N/A
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
There are no acceptance criteria for clinical sensitivity. Analysis of normal and
clinical samples was performed for internal validation.
b. Clinical specificity:
There are no acceptance criteria for clinical specificity. Analysis of normal and
clinical samples was performed for internal validation.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
N/A
4. Clinical cut-off:
N/A
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Testing was performed in accordance with CLSI/NCCLS C28-A2, How to Define and
Determine Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory, Approved Guideline-
Second Edition. A normal range study was conducted to assess the Reference Ranges
for the LH 780 System. Whole blood samples were collected from 126 donors (males
and females) from the Beckman Coulter Inc. blood donor program. The selection of
donors was consistent with guidelines stated in CLSI/NCCLS C28-A2. Reference
intervals for each parameter were calculated using 95% confidence limits.
Acceptance criteria were listed in the Performance Characteristics section of the Draft
On-Line Help CD Rom, Section 13. Acceptance criteria were met.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
In order to demonstrate substantial equivalence of the LH 780 Hematology Analyzer to the
LH 750 hematology analyzer, the LH 750 Body fluids Application and Sysmex XE-2100
Hematology Analyzer (for RDW-SD) experiments were designed and executed based on
accepted industry standards and internal product development procedures. The performance
protocols for data collection adhere to CLSI/NCCLS documents, ICSH/ISLH recommended
reference methods, FDA guidance documents, and scientifically valid procedures.
Data was collected internally using normal and clinical samples at the Beckman Coulter, Inc.
Systems and Applications Support Laboratory in Miami, Florida. Normal whole blood
8

--- Page 9 ---
specimens were obtained from the in-house blood center using a screened pool of donors.
Clinical samples were obtained by arrangement with local hospitals, using spent specimens
from routine laboratory analyses. For external site testing, clinical samples were obtained by
using spent specimens from routine laboratory analysis.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
