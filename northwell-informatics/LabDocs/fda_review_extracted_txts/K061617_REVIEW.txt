4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable; the device is a visually-read single-use device.
I. Device Description:
Forsure One Step Dip & Read Drug Screen Test contains up to twelve individual
chromatographic absorbent strips in which the drug or drug metabolites in the sample
compete with a drug conjugate immobilized on a porous membrane support for the
limited antibody sites. The method employs unique monoclonal and polyclonal
antibodies to selectively identify the drug or drug metabolite in the sample. The
membrane on the strip is coated with goat anti-mouse antibody and a specific drug-
protein conjugate. The sample pad contains a colloidal gold labeled mouse
monoclonal anti specific drug antibody. The device is for single-use and is visually
read.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced
L. Test Principle:
The test employs lateral flow immunochromatographic technology. Drug in the
sample and drug-labeled conjugate (containing a chromagen) compete for antibody
binding sites in the test area of the test strip. Binding of drug in the sample causes
the absence of a line at the test area, i.e., a preliminary positive result. When drug is
not present in the sample, the drug-labeled conjugate binds at the test line, resulting
in formation of a line, i.e., a negative result. The absence or presence of the line is
determined visually by the operator.
The device also has an internal process control which indicates that an adequate
volume of sample has been added and that the immunochromatographic strip is intact.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed using in house drug standards. The standard
was diluted in drug-free urine to give drug concentrations at the following
levels: 0, 50%, 75%, 100%, 125% and 150% of the cutoff. A total of 15
determinations were made at each concentration for each analyte. Testing was
performed on one day by one operator. All samples at 0 and -50% yielded
negative results and all samples 150% yielded positive results. Within lot
precision study data for 75%, 100%and 125% is summarized below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The device has an internal procedural control. A magenta line appearing in the
control region (C) is considered as an internal procedural control. It confirms
sufficient specimen volume and adequate membrane wicking.
External control materials are not supplied with these tests; however it is
recommended that positive and negative controls be tested as a good
laboratory practice to confirm the test procedure and to verify proper test
performance. User should follow local, state and federal guidelines for testing
QC material.
Stability
Real time and accelerated studies have been conducted. Protocols and
acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The
manufacturer claims the following expiration date:
When stored at 2 – 30ºC product is good until expiration date which is 18
months.
d. Detection limit:
A drug-free urine pool was spiked with specific drug at the following
concentrations: 25% and 50% below the cutoff, cutoff and 25% above the
cutoff. The results are presented in the table below:

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking various concentrations of similarly
structured drug compounds into normal human urine. By analyzing various
concentration of each compound the sponsor determined the concentration of
the drug that produced a response approximately equivalent to the cutoff
concentration of the assay. Results of those studies appear in the tables below:

The following compounds were evaluated for potential positive and/or negative
interference with the assay. To evaluate for interference the sponsor added
potentially interfering compounds to drug-free urine (to test for positive
interference) and to urine samples at the cutoff concentration (to test for negative
interference). All potential interferents were added at a concentration of 100
µg/mL. There were no deviations from the expected results.

The following endogenous compounds were evaluated for potential positive
and/or negative interference with the assay. To evaluate for interference the
sponsor added potentially interfering compounds to drug-free urine (to test for
positive interference) and to urine samples at the cutoff concentration plus 25%
(to test for negative interference). There were no deviations from the expected
results.
Substances
Bilirubin 1.0 mg/dL
Creatinine 500 mg/dL
Glucose 1500 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 300 mg/dL
Potassium 110 mEq/dL
Human Serum Albumin 500 mg/dL
Globulin 1500 mg/dL
Sodium chloride 6000 mg/dL
Uric Acid 23 mg/dL
Cholesterol 500 mg/dL
There is the possibility that other substances and/or factors not listed above may
interfere with the test and cause false results, e.g., technical or procedural errors.
Specific Gravity
Two drug free urine samples, one with a specific gravity of 1.030 and the other
1.003 were prepared. The samples were divided into two and one was spiked with
drug concentration at 25% above the cutoff for all the analytes. Each sample was
run in duplicate. The results demonstrate that a specific gravity range of 1.003 –
1.030 did not affect the expected or accuracy of the results.
pH
The pH of an aliquot negative urine pool was adjusted to a pH range of 4 to 9 in 1
pH increments for a total of six samples. Each of the samples was split into two
samples to form a pair for each pH level. One of the paired samples from each set
was spiked with drug concentration at 25% above the cutoff for all the analytes.
Each sample was run on the device and the results demonstrate that varying
ranges of pH dose not interfere with the performance of the test.
f. Assay cut-off:
The identified cutoff concentrations for amphetamine, cocaine,
methamphetamine, opiates 2000, Phencyclidine and THC are those
recommended by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA). SAMHSA has not recommended a cutoff
concentration for Barbiturate, Benzodiazepine, Oxycodone, Propoxyphene and
Tricyclic Antidepressant (TCA).

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
93-110 unaltered clinical urine samples, depending on the drug type, were
evaluated. Specimens obtained from a reference laboratory were tested using
the Forsure One Step Dip & Read Drug Screen Test and Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). Approximately 10% of
samples had drug concentration between 50% below the cutoff and the cutoff
concentration, another 10% of samples had drug concentration between the
cutoff and 50% above the cutoff concentration.
