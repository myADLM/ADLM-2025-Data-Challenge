For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST
Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and
equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™
Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST broth, which contains an AST
indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST broth is a cation-adjusted formulation
of Mueller-Hinton broth containing 0.01% Tween 80. After adding the indicator solution
to the AST inoculum the color is blue and after inoculation and incubation changes to
pink then to colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds. Inoculated panels are
barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System
instrument where the panels are continuously incubated at 350C. The AST has a final
inoculum of 5 x 105 CFU/ml. The instrument incubates, reads and records the results of
the biochemical substrates and antimicrobial agents and interprets the reactions to give an
ID of the isolate and MIC value and category interpretation of the antimicrobial agents.
Organisms growing in the presence of a given antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator,
signaling organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or
inhibited by a given antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do
not produce a color change. Additional interpretation is done using software driven
“EXPERT” System using rules derived from the NCCLS documentation.
Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an ID result available between 2-12 hours and
an AST result available between 4-16 hours. This is only an autoread result; there are no
manual readings possible.

L. Test Principle:
The system employs conventional, colorimetric, fluorogenic and chromogenic
substrates to identify the genus and species of the isolate. The AST portion of the BD
Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth based microdilution method
that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance detection
of organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells
containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control
wells” which contains no antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Twenty seven isolates were evaluated for site to site and inter site
reproducibility demonstrating >95% reproducibility. The ten isolate study
described in the guidance document was used (10 organisms tested 3 times on
3 days at 3 sites).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The FDA and CLSI recommended QC isolates, E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and
S. aureus ATCC 29213 were tested on every test occasion with the reference
method and the BD Phoenix™. The reference method QC results were in
range for every day tested. The Phoenix™ was tested a sufficient number of
times to demonstrate that the system can produce QC results in the CLSI
recommended ranges most of the time. The mode of the E. faecalis QC with
the reference method was 1 dilution lower than the test method.

Inoculum density control: The organism suspension density of the ID
broth was equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard using the BBL™
CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer which was verified each day of testing.
Internal data was used to demonstrate that the use of the BBL™
CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer would produce reproducible results.
Five different instruments were used.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The CLSI recommended broth dilution reference panel was prepared
according to the CLSI recommendation. Clinical testing was performed at
four sites. The testing included both fresh clinical isolates and stock isolates
along with a challenge set with known results. The test device had a growth
rate of >95%. A comparison was provided to the reference method with the
following agreement.

CA-Category Agreement vmj-very major discrepancies
R-resistant isolates
N/A – No minor errors possible since there is no intermediate category
Essential agreement (EA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panels agree with the
reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference
method. Category agreement (CA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panel result
interpretation (SIR) agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation.
Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the BD Phoenix™ and
the reference and have on-scale EA.
Also tested in the clinical study were 484 Methicillin Resistant Staphylococci

(MRS). However, MRS will be reported as amoxicillin/clavulanate resistant regardless
of MIC value but the ability of the BD Phoenix™ to detect resistance in this group
accurately demonstrates that the 1 vmj for the Methicillin Susceptible Staphylococcus
(MSS) group would be acceptable. The maj error and vmj error rates for the MSS group
are both acceptable.
There appears to be a trend with the Enterococcus spp. where the test device is more
resistant than the reference method. This was observed in the QC and clinical studies.
Also, the maj error rate for the Enterococcus spp. group of 4.0% was higher than as
recommended in the guidance document but these recommendations are based on errors
that would include a minor error range. Since this antibiotic has only a Sensitive (S) and
a Resistant (R) result, all errors are either vmj or maj with no minor errors possible.
However, if those errors that are in EA are removed, the maj rate of 2.7% (8/298) is
acceptable. The vmj error rate for the Enterococcus spp. group is acceptable.
