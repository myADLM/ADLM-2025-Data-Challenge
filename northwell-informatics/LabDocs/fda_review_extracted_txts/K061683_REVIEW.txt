L. Test Principle:
In this immunoturbidimetric method, latex–bound anti-myoglobin antibodies react
with antigen in the sample to form an antigen/antibody complex which after
agglutination can be determined turbidimetrically.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed by measuring human samples and controls
on the Hitachi 917 analyzer. Samples were run in triplicate, one run per day,
for 21 days. The following results were obtained:
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Three sets of dilution series (one fresh unspiked serum, two spiked sera)
diluted with saline were measured on the Hitachi 917 analyzer. Each series
was measured using three lots of reagent. The linearity data support a linear
range of 20-580 µg/L for the Hitachi 917.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The C.f.a.s. Myoglobin values are traceable to an immunological method.
Results are corrected by an additive factor (+8 µg/L) to maintain traceability.
Performance was validated using this correction.
Stability:
A real-time stability study was performed on three lots of C.f.a.s. Myoglobin.
Testing interval was done at 21, 23 or 24 months and the calibrator was stored
at 2-80C. At the end of the storage period, the stored C.f.a.s. Myoglobin is
compared to values originally obtained using the fresh reference material at
the zero time-point. The recovery is calculated as a percentage of the
reference value. The average percent recovery is 97%. The open-vial
stability was done at 1,3,5,7 weeks interval with bottles opened and closed
once a week; and for 1,2,4,6 hrs interval with calibrator opened on the
instrument (Hitachi 911). At the end of the respective storage period, the
stored controls are compared to the reference material (C.f.a.s. Myoglobin
stored at 2-80C). All measurements were performed in triplicate and the
recovery is calculated as a percentage of the reference value. The applicant’s
acceptance criterion is 90-110 % recovery compared to the reference value.
d. Detection limit:
20 µg/L
Limit of the blank was determined by running 21 replicates of the 0 calibrator
on the Hitachi 917. The limit of the blank represents the lowest measurable
myoglobin concentration that can be distinguished from zero. It is calculated
as the concentration at three standard deviations above that of the lowest
standard (0 µg/L).
e. Analytical specificity:
The anti-myoglobin antibody is specific for the myoglobin protein.
Interference and Limitations:
The applicant claims no significant interference up to
• I index of 60 (Conjugated and
unconjugated bilirubin up to 60
mg/dL)
• H index of 500 (Hemoglobin up to 500
mg/dL)
• L index of 500 (Intralipid)
5

--- Page 6 ---
• Rheumatoid factors up to 100 IU/mL
The applicant claims no interference from 18 commonly used
pharmaceuticals.
(All substances tested are defined by the applicant as no significant
interference if the % recovery exceeded or equal to ± 10 % of the expected
100% recovery. For drugs interference, the applicant defined no significant
interference if the % recovery exceeded or equal to ± 10 % of the expected
100% recovery from the reference value for the lower drug concentration
tested.)
In rare cases gammopathy, in particular type IgM, may cause unreliable
results.
A high-dose hook effect may occur at myoglobin concentrations >10,000
µg/L.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A comparison of the Myoglobin determination using serum on the Roche
Tina-Quant Myoglobin Gen.2 assay (y) with the Roche Tina-Quant assay (x)
using the Hitachi 917 gave the following correlation: y=1.014x + 3.4, r=
0.996, n=48; samples used ranged from 31.5 µg/L to 522.7 µg/L.
Another comparison study between the Roche Tina-Quant Myoglobin Gen.2
assay (y) with the Roche Elecsys Myoglobin STAT assay (x) gave the
following correlation: y=0.924x + 4.5, r= 0.991, n=58; samples used ranged
from 26.1 µg/L to 347 µg/L.
b. Matrix comparison:
The matrix studies were performed using the following reference: “ Use of
Anticoagulants in Diagnostic Laboratory Investigations”.WHO/DIL/LAB/99.1
Rev.2 Jan 2002. Paired serum and plasma samples were collected and
analyzed using the Hitachi 917 and results were evaluated by linear regression
analysis. Additional sample type tested were Li or Na Heparin; K2- or K3-
EDTA plasma. The samples used ranged from 23µg/L to 527µg/L All linear
regression analysis of the sample types were considered acceptable by the
applicant if the slope is 0.9 to 1.10; the intercept is < ± 10 µg/L; and the r

>0.98. All correlations met the applicant’s stated criteria.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
None
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Expected values for Myoglobin are as follows: Men: 23-72 µg/L; Women: 19-51
µg/L. These data are from a multi-center evaluation using Tina-Quant Myoglobin
(the predicate device). The applicant stated that because the predicate device and
this device showed similar performance characteristics and met acceptance
criteria for method comparison studies, this reference range can be applied to the
Myoglobin Gen.2 Test System.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
