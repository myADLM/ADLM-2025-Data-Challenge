H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
ESBL confirmation with Ceftazidime (1, 8 µg/mL), Ceftazidime/clavulanic acid
(0.25/4, 2/4 µg/mL), and Cefotaxime 2, 16 µg/mL), Cefotaxime/clavulanic acid

negative bacilli.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The MicroScan® Dried Panels containing ceftazidime/clavulanic acid and
cefotaxime/clavulanic acid can be used to confirm the presence of ESBLs
production in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumonia, and
Proteus mirabilis.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The Prompt® method of inoculation is an alternate method of inoculation
preparation that is supported in the methodology along with the turbidity method.
The stationary and log inoculum methods should not be used with this antibiotic.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Readings may be performed on the autoSCAN®-4 and WalkAway® Systems.
I. Device Description:
This submission is for the AST Panel only. The ID System was not reviewed.
The MicroScan® Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel contains microdilutions
of each antimicrobial agent in various concentrations with Mueller Hinton Broth and
various nutrients which are dehydrated and dried in panels. Each panel contains two
control wells: a no-growth control well (contains water only/no nutrients or broth),
and a growth control well (contains test medium without antibiotic). The panel is
rehydrated and inoculated at the same time with 0.1 ml of suspension prepared by the
turbidity method (inoculum prepared in water, then 0.1ml transferred to 25ml of
inoculum water containing pluronic-D/F-a wetting solution) for a final inoculum of 3-
7 X 105. The Prompt® method of inoculation is also recommended as an alternate
means of preparing the inoculum. The panels are incubated at 35o C in a non-CO
2
incubator for 16-20 hours and read by visual observation of growth. Panels may be

Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
After incubation in a non-CO incubator for 16-20 hours, the minimum inhibitory
2
concentration (MIC) for the test organisms are read by determining the lowest
antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth. The panels can be read
manually and with the autoSCAN®-4 by observing growth or no growth or with the
use of the WalkAway® instrument, which uses an optics system with growth
algorithms to directly measure organism growth.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 12 isolates of P. mirabilis E. coli and
Klebsiella spp. tested at 3 sites on 3 separate days in triplicate. The study
included the testing of both the turbidity inoculum method and Prompt®
method of inoculation with readings performed manually, with the
autoSCAN®-4 and WalkAway® Systems. All methods provided acceptable
reproducibility.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality Control with E. coli ATCC 25922 and K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603
were tested with the expected result on most days using the Prompt® and the
turbidity method of inoculation with readings performed manually, with the
autoSCAN®-4 and WalkAway® Systems. The Prompt® failed Quality
control on slightly more occasions than the turbidity method of inoculation
but still provided acceptable results overall. The method of reading made no
difference in the results.
Inoculum density control: A turbidity meter was used for the turbidity
inoculation method with daily checks. The Prompt® method of inoculation
had colony counts performed periodically throughout the study to determine
the average inoculum density since there is no visual check of the inoculum
using this device. The average of the Quality Control recommended isolates
were acceptable except an occasional colony count outside the recommended
range for the CLSI reference method.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 95 isolates of P. mirabilis, E. coli, and K. oxytoca and K.
pneumonia that were previously molecular characterized were tested at one
site. Forty two of these were ESBL positive. These 95 were tested with both
the Prompt® and the turbidity methods of inoculation. Data was analyzed
using the streamlined dilutions of Ceftazidime (1, 8 µg/mL),
Ceftazidime/clavulanic acid (0.25/4, 2/4 µg/mL), and Cefotaxime 2, 16
µg/mL), Cefotaxime/clavulanic acid (0.5/4, 4/4 µg/mL) and compared to the
expected molecular result. Results were exactly the same no matter which
read method was used with the turbidity method of inoculation (see chart
below for % agreement) The Prompt® method of inoculation had more
variability with both one additional false positive with the manual read
method and 2 false positives with the instrument read results. The following
charts demonstrates the performance as compared to molecular
characterization using the turbidity and the Prompt® methods of inoculation
with results read manually and with the AutoSCAN®- 4 and WalkAway®
Systems.
