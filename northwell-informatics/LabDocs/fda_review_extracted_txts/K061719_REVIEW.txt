I. Device Description:
The Dimension Vista™ TBIL Flex® reagent cartridge is an in vitro diagnostic device
that consists of prepackaged, liquid reagents in a plastic twelve well cartridge for use
on the Dade Behring Dimension® clinical chemistry system for the quantitative
determination of total bilirubin levels in serum and plasma. The flex cartridge
contains caffeine in buffer and EDTA, a sulfanilic acid-hydrochloric acid solution,
and sodium nitrite.
The Dimension Vista™ TDBIL Calibrator is packaged as three vials of a single level
lyophilized product to be stored at 2-8°C. The matrix is bilirubin depleted human
serum spiked with ditaurobilirubin targeted to 27.5 mg/dL. Purified water, the low
level calibrator, is supplied on-board the instrument. The master pool is a multi-level,
lyophilized bilirubin-depleted human serum containing ditaurobilirubin and is stored
at -20°C.
All human source material was tested by FDA-approved methods for HIV-1/2,
HBsAg, and HCV and found to be negative.

L. Test Principle:
TBIL Flex® reagent cartridge:
Diazotized sulfanilic acid is formed by combining sodium nitrite and sulfanilic acid at
low pH. Bilirubin (unconjugated) in the sample is solubilized by dilution in a mixture
of caffeine/benzoate/acetate/EDTA. Upon addition of the diazotized sulfanilic acid,
the solubilized bilirubin including conjugated bilirubins (mono and diglucoronides)
and the delta form (biliprotein-bilirubin covalently bound to albumin) is converted to
diazo-bilirubin, a red chromophore representing the total bilirubin which absorbs at
540 nm and is measured using a bichromatic (540, 700 nm) endpoint technique. A
sample blank correction is used.
Solubilized bilirubin + diazotized sulfanilic acid —> red chromophore (absorbs at
540 nm)

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed a precision evaluation study based on CLSI Document
EP5-A2. During each day of testing, two separate runs, with two test samples
for each test material, were analyzed for twenty days. The test material
consisted of three control levels (Level 1, 2 and 3 at low, medium and high
bilirubin levels within the claimed linear range of the assay) as well as a
pooled serum sample. The summary of the precision results are shown below:
Mean Standard Deviation
Repeatability Within-lab
Material mg/dL [umol/L] mg/dL [umol/L] (%CV) mg/dL [umol/L] (%CV)
Serum pool 1.0 [17] 0.03 [0.5] (2.7) 0.03 [0.5] (3.3)
Lymphocheck
Level 1 0.9 [15] 0.04 [1] (5.0) 0.04 [1] (5.0)
Level 2 4.4 [75] 0.10 [2] (2.4) 0.11 [2] (2.6)
MAS
Bilirubin
Level 3 19.3 [330] 0.31 [5] (1.6) 0.56 [10] (2.9)
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range this assay is 0.1-25.0 mg/dL [2 - 428 μmol/L].
Linearity was evaluated by comparing the observed versus expected values
obtained with the Dimension Vista TBIL method using eleven samples at
various concentrations. Data generated during this study indicate an
acceptable assay recovery from 0.1 to 25.0 mg/dL with percent recoveries
within 10% of the predicted values.
Regression Statistics (linear least square)
Slope: 0.98
Y-intercept: -0.24
r: 1.000
The sponsor recommends that samples with results in excess of 25.0 mg/dL
[428μmol/L] be repeated after dilution. Accurate dilution of samples using the
recommended diluent (CLSI type 1 Reagent grade water) was demonstrated
by diluting multiple elevated samples at a 1:4 ratio. The results support the
sponsor’s recommendation for diluted samples.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability: Shelf life for this calibrator is 12 months. Open vial testing
protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable.
Traceability and Value Assignment: Values are assigned to the master pool by
calibrating the Dimension® Total Bilirubin method with freshly prepared

National Institute of Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Material (SRM)
916, Bilirubin at five levels across the assay range.
Since there is no reference standard for direct bilirubin, the DBIL values are
assigned based on the ratio of direct and total bilirubin as determined by
Doumas et. al., Clin Chem 1985;31:1677-1682, and the method differences
versus the Jendrassik Grof assay. DBIL value is calculated as 70% of the total
bilirubin assignment.
d. Detection limit:
Twenty consecutive measurements of a sample devoid of bilirubin were tested
on the Dimension Vista™ system. Analytical sensitivity was defined as the
concentration at two standard deviations above the mean of the twenty
replicates. The analytical sensitivity of the Dimension Vista™ TBIL method
tested with water is 0.05 mg/dL. The sponsor is using a slightly wider product
claim of 0.1 mg/dL on the product labeling to accommodate instrument-to-
instrument variability.
e. Analytical specificity:
The Dimension Vista™ TBIL assay was evaluated for interference using a
protocol developed according to CLSI Document EP7-A2 8. Bias is the
difference in the results between the control sample (without the interferent)
and the test sample (contains the interferent) expressed in mg/dL [μmol/L].
Bias exceeding 10% was considered interference.

Salicylic acid 60 mg/dL [4.34 mmol/L] 25[428] -11%
Other exogenous substances found to not interfere with the TBIL method are
listed in the package insert. Inaccuracies (biases) due to these substances are
less than 10% at total bilirubin concentrations of 1.0 - 1.2 mg/dL and 21.0 -
27.1 mg/dL.
The potential for interference from endogenous substances (lipids and
hemoglobin) was evaluated. Results are summarized below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A split sample method comparison was conducted with one hundred fifty
serum samples using the Dimension TBIL (predicate) and Dimension Vista™
TBIL assays. The samples were analyzed in duplicate on the Dimension and
Dimension Vista™ systems. The model equation for the linear least squares
regression statistics is: [results for Dimension Vista™ System] = slope x
[comparative method results] + intercept. A regression slope of 0.942,
intercept of 0.039 mg/dL and correlation of 0.999 demonstrate acceptable
agreement between the assays. The range of TBIL values in the correlation
study was: 0.11 to 23.4 mg/dL.
b. Matrix comparison:
A split sample method comparison was conducted on two different days with
a total of sixty-four matched serum, EDTA plasma and lithium heparin plasma
samples using the Dimension Vista™ TBIL assay. The samples were analyzed
in duplicate. The model equation for the linear least squares regression
statistics is: [results for Dimension Vista™ System] = slope x [comparative
method results] + intercept. The regression of the mean results provided
slopes that ranged from 0.98 to 1.01, intercepts from -0.15 to 0.32 mg/dL and
correlation of 0.993 to 0.994.
