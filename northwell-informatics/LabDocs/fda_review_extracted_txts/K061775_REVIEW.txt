H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indication(s) for use.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The L-Type Creatinine-M is an in-vitro assay for the quantitative determination of
creatinine in serum, plasma, and urine. Creatinine measurements are used in the
diagnosis and treatment of renal diseases, in monitoring renal dialysis, and as a
calculation basis for measuring other urine analytes.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For professional use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Hitachi 917
I. Device Description:
The Wako L-Type Creatinine-M Test is a two reagent system for use on an automated
analyzer such as the Hitachi 917. Both reagents contain enzymes with stabilizers
and/or buffers. The test is calibrated by using a calibrator with values determined by
using enzymatic reagents and SRM914a (NIST) creatinine standard material as the
primary standard. The calibrator matrix is an aqueous solution containing pH,
viscosity, and specific gravity adjustors.

CLSI EP5-A: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices;
Approved Guideline
CLSI EP17-A: Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of
Quantitation; Approved Guideline
L. Test Principle:
Creatinine present in samples is acted upon by creatininase, creatinase, sarcosine
oxidase, and HMMPS to form a blue pigment. The creatinine concentration is
obtained by measuring the absorbance of the blue pigment.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run precision was evaluated by testing 3 serum and 3 urine samples in
one run 21 times. The results are summarized below.

Total Precision was evaluated following CLSI EP-5A by performing two runs
per day, with each run testing 3 serum and 3 urine samples in duplicate for 21
days. The results are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
High level creatinine samples were created by spiking creatinine into pooled
serum and urine samples at concentrations 10% to 20% above the upper end
of the measuring ranges. These samples were then sequentially diluted with
low level serum and urine samples, respectively. Both the serum and urine
samples had measured results within ±10% of the expected values. A slope
close to 1 and correlation coefficient of 0.99 was calculated for both the serum
and urine linearity samples. These results demonstrated that with this assay
the measurement of creatinine is linear in the range of 0.2 mg/dL to 100
mg/dL in serum or plasma and 1.0 mg/dL to 200 mg/dL in urine.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The creatinine calibrator value is traceable to NIST SRM914a. The assigned
value of the calibrator is determined by enzymatic methods.
The calibrators are stable until the expiration date when stored at 2 – 10°C.
Once opened the calibrator is stable for 3 months when tightly recapped and
stored in the original container at 2 – 10°C.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection was determined at outlined in CLSI EP-17A. The limit
of detection was determined to be 0.06 mg/dL in urine and 0.03 mg/dL in
serum/plasma.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering compounds were evaluated by spiking various concentrations of
the interferants into a creatinine sample and comparing the results of the
interferent spiked samples with an unspiked creatinine reference sample.
Non-interference was defined as a recovery of 90% - 110% of the unspiked
reference sample. The highest concentration of each compound that did not
interfere is shown below.
Interfering compound Maximum concentration tested
Hemoglobin 500 mg/dL

The sponsor also compared 60 urine samples ranging from 30.44 to 197.01
