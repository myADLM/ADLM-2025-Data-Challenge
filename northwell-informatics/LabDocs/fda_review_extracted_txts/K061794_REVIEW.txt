L. Test Principle:
The FIDIS™ THYRO kit is a multiplexed, semiquantitative, fluorescent
immunoassay performed on the FIDIS™ System using MLX-BOOSTER Software,
and allows the detection and identification of antibodies against thyroglubulin (TG)
and thyroperoxidase (TPO). Diluted patient sera and microsphere suspensions
precoated with either TPO or TG are mixed in a 96 well microtiter plate. TPO or TG
specific antibodies in the patient sera, if present, bind to the immobilized antigen on
the beads. Any unbound material is removed by performing a filtration wash step.
Phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-human IgG is added to the plate and a further
incubation performed. The conjugated anti-human IgG binds to the TPO or TG
specific antibodies immobilized on the microsphere surface to form an
antigen/antibody complex. The bead suspension is then analyzed by the FIDIS
instrument. The FIDIS™ Instrument uses a red diode laser beam to distinguish
between the internally, color-coded microspheres for each antigen on the basis of its
unique fluorescence intensity (red to orange), while a green laser beam excites the
reporter conjugate, quantifying the fluorescence of the antibody captured by each
microsphere. The degree of binding is calculated in biological units (IU/mL) using
specific data software (MLX-BOOSTER). Measurement of the fluorescent signal
from the final reaction allows the quantification of the presence or absence of
autoantibodies.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To evaluate intra-assay and inter-assay precision and reproducibility, a total of
14 serum samples with various concentrations of antibodies to TPO or TG
representing the measuring range, were analyzed using the FIDIS™ THYRO
kit. For within-run, 6 TPO samples and 8 TG samples representing the
measuring range were assayed 10 times in one run. For between-run, the
same samples were assayed 2 times per run for 6 runs. The acceptance
criteria %CV <30% was achieved. The results are as follows:

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity with autoimmune antibodies common to other systemic
autoimmune diseases was evaluated by testing 96 serum samples representing
a spectrum of autoimmune diseases. Eight of the 96 samples were positive for
TPO and 2 were positive for TG. The Limitations section of the package
insert includes the statement “Hemolytic, lipemic, icteric or citrated samples,
or samples with abnormal concentration of immunoglobulins,
cryoglobulinemia or complement levels or samples with rheumatoid factor
may confound the results of this assay. Use of these samples should be
avoided.”
The autoimmune disorders evaluated and results are as follows:

f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off of 150 IU/mL was determined by assaying 146 normal
serum samples (50 normal and 96 with potential biological interferences).
The following results were obtained and between the thresholds the results are
considered equivocal (results < 150 IU/mL and > 130 IU/mL).
Percentiles of the distribution values <130 IU/mL <150 IU/mL

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The FIDIS™ THYRO assay was compared to the ImmunoWELL™ TPO IgG
and TG IgG ELISA assays by testing 247 samples (101 positive for one or
both of the antigens, 146 negative samples). No information about age,
gender, and clinical status was available. Equivocal results were considered
negative for the purpose of calculating percent agreements.
