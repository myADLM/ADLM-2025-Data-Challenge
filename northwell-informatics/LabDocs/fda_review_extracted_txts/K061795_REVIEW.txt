L. Test Principle:
The PBNP method is a one-step sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based on
Luminescent Oxygen Channeling Immunoassay (LOCI™) technology. LOCI™ reagents
include two latex bead reagents and a biotinylated polyclonal antibody fragment which
recognize an epitope located in the N-terminal part of proBNP. The first bead reagent
(Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitive dye. The second bead
reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a second antibody specific for a second independent
epitope on NT-proBNP and contains chemiluminescent dye. Sample is incubated with
Chemibeads and biotinylated antibody to form a particle/NT-proBNP/biotinylated antibody
sandwich. Sensibeads then are added and bind to the biotin to form a bead-aggregated
immunocomplex. Illumination of the complex by light at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen
from Sensibeads, which diffuses to the Chemibeads and triggers a chemiluminescent reaction.
The resulting chemiluminescent signal is measured at 612 nm and is directly proportional to
the concentration of NT-proBNP in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
CLSI EP5-A2 was used. During each day of testing, two separate runs, with
two test samples, for each test material, were analyzed for 20 days. The results
are presented in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The assay reportable range is 5-35,000 pg/mL. A patient plasma sample with a
high NT-proBNP concentration was diluted across the assay range. An
additional plasma sample was diluted linearly to confirm dilutional accuracy
at the low end of the assay range. All samples were diluted with low level
patient plasma pools.

Range 94-100 100-105
Hook effect was evaluated using samples containing NT-proBNP
concentrations ranging from 0 to 400,000 pg/mL. The samples were prepared
with Roche synthetic antigen spiked into 5% bovine serum base material. No
hook effect was found up to 400,000 pg/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The assay is referenced to Roche purified synthetic NT-proBNP (1-76). The
assigned values for the Dimension Vista Calibrator are referenced to a master
pool containing synthetic human N-terminal pr0-brain natriuretic peptide.
Un-open calibrators stored frozen at -20 to -10º C are stable until the stated
expiration date. Calibrator stability is determined using Dade Behring’s shelf
life stability protocol and is ongoing. Open vial stability was set at 7 days to
be consistent with other Dimension Vista® system calibrators, although

stability studies demonstrated that the calibrators were stable for longer than 7
days.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity of the PBNP method is ≤ 5 pg/mL. Analytical
sensitivity is defined as the concentration at two standard deviations (N=20)
above a sample devoid of NT-proBNP, such as the PBNP Level 1 Calibrator
(0 pg/mL). The analytical sensitivity was determined by assaying 20
consecutive replicates of the 0 pg/mL level calibrator. The analytical
sensitivity was then calculated by determining the standard deviation (SD) of
the 20 replicates, multiplying by 2 and adding it to the absolute value of the
mean. The analytical sensitivity of the Dimension Vista PBNP method was
1.186. A claim of ≤ 5 pg/mL will be used to account for instrument
variability.
Functional sensitivity for NT-proBNP is defined as the analyte detection
concentration corresponding to a 20% CV. This was determined by
performing a 20 day ANOVA experiment using samples prepared from
normal human serum. Two replicates of each sample were analyzed once per
day for 20 days. Total % CV was plotted vs. the target PBNP concentration.
Although the functional sensitivity was determined to be 7 pg/mL, a claim of
≤ 30 pg/mL will be used to account for instrument to instrument variability.
e. Analytical specificity:
The NT-proBNP assay was evaluated for interference according to CLSI EP7-A. The
following substances demonstrated no significant bias (defined as < 10 %).
Substance Substance Concentration NT-proBNP Concentration Bias %

An extensive list of other compounds was evaluated for interference and was
found to have no significant interference or cross reactivity. A list of these
compounds is present in the product labeling. The following substances have
no significant cross-reactivity (less than 1 %) at the concentrations indicated
when added to samples containing 0 and approximately 125 pg/mL NT-

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A split sample comparison study was performed between the Dimension Vista
NY-proBNP assay and the predicate Roche Elecsys proBNP assay with serum
and heparinized plasma patient samples. CLSI EP9-A was used. Samples were
obtained from patients known to have CHF (n = 269) and patients with no
history available (n = 150). The range of NT-proBNP values in the correlation
study was 5.1 to 32,779 pg/mL.

b. Matrix comparison:
Comparison of 50 matched serum and lithium heparin plasma samples with
values ranging from 33.2 pg/mL to 35,925 pg/mL on the Dimension Vista
system gave a slope of 1.00, an intercept of -32.3, and a correlation coefficient
of 0.999 using linear regression statistics.
Comparison of 72 matched serum and EDTA plasma samples with values
ranging from 7.8 pg/mL to 29,272 pg/mL on the Dimension Vista system gave
a slope of 0.99, an intercept of 2.3, and a correlation coefficient of 0.999 using
linear regression statistics.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
