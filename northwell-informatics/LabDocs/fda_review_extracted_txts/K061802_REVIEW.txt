--- Page 2 ---
The CardioPhase® hsCRP method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the
quantitative measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) in human serum and
plasma by means of particle enhanced immunonephelometry on the Dimension
Vista™ System. High sensitivity CRP measurements may be used for evaluation
of conditions thought to be associated with inflammation, in otherwise healthy
individuals and as an independent risk marker for the identification and
stratification of individuals at risk for future cardiovascular disease.
Measurements of hsCRP, when used in conjunction with traditional clinical
laboratory evaluation of acute coronary syndromes, may be useful as an
independent marker of prognosis for recurrent events, in patients with stable
coronary disease or acute coronary syndromes.
Dimension Vista™ Protein 2 Calibrator:
Protein 2 Calibrator is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of the high
sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) method on the Dimension Vista™ System.
Dimension Vista™ high sensitivity CRP Control L and Dimension Vista™ high
sensitivity CRP Control H:
hsCRP Control L and H are for use as assayed intralaboratory quality controls for
the assessment of precision and analytical bias in determination of C-reactive
protein (CRP) on the Dimension Vista™ System.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
AHA/CDC Expert Panel Recommendations1:
The AHA/CDC Expert Panel has the following recommendations for
limitations on the use of hsCRP:
• hsCRP levels should not be substituted for assessment of traditional
cardiovascular risk factors.
• Application of management guidelines for acute coronary syndromes
should not be dependent on hsCRP levels.
• When using the assay for risk assessment, patients with persistently
unexplained, marked elevation of hsCRP (>10 mg/L) after repeated testing
should be evaluated for non-cardiovascular etiologies.
• The expert panel recommends against screening of the entire adult
population for hsCRP as a public health measure.
• Patients with evidence of active infection, systemic inflammatory
processes or trauma should not be tested for cardiovascular disease risk
assessment until these conditions have abated.
• Application of secondary prevention measures should not depend on
1 Pearson TA, Mensah GA, Alexander RW, et al. Markers of Inflammation and Cardiovascular Disease:
application to clinical and public health practice: A statement for healthcare professionals from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Heart Association. Circulation 2003;107:499-511.

hsCRP determination, but rather an array of risk factors (global risk
assessment).
• Serial measurements of hsCRP should not be used to monitor effects of
treatment.
• Two separate hsCRP measurements (optimally two weeks apart) should be
obtained before performing risk assessment, due to within-subject hsCRP
variability.

L. Test Principle:
Polystyrene particles coated with monoclonal antibodies specific to human CRP are
aggregated when mixed with samples containing CRP. These aggregates scatter a
beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is
proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is
evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was done in accordance with CLSI/NCCLS Approved
Guideline for Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Devices: EP5-
A2. Specimens at each level were analyzed in duplicate, twice a day, for 20
days. The repeatability and within-lab standard deviations (SD) and percent
coefficient of variation (%CV) were calculated by the analysis of variance
method. The data are summarized below.
hsCRP Precision Data Summary
Material Mean Repeatability Within-Lab
mg/L SD (%CV) SD (%CV)
hsCRP CON L 1.15 0.06 (4.8) 0.06 (5.4)
hsCRP CON H 3.46 0.14 (4.0) 0.15 (4.4)
Serum pool 2.39 0.13 (5.2) 0.13 (5.2)
Serum pool 6.50 0.33 (5.0) 0.37 (5.7)
Serum pool 7.72 0.36 (4.6) 0.42 (5.4)
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range if 0.16 – 9.5 mg/L is based on linearity, detection limit
and method comparison.
Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by testing serum samples with
high concentrations of CRP. These samples were serially diluted with System
Diluent down to the lower measuring range (7.90 to 0.22 mg/L) in 13 points.
Each dilution was tested in replicates of five. Percent recovery was calculated
using the formula: Mean of test/ expected concentration X 100.
The linear regression was calculated.
Slope Intercept Correlation Coefficient
1.012 0.097 0.998
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Standard values are assigned to a master calibrator lot using CRM 470.
Values are then assigned to the commercial calibrator (human pooled at target
concentration) verses master calibrator using three reference curves, 4 runs, 3
vials, 4 replicates per vial tested on two nephelometric instruments for a total
of 144 measurements.
Control values are assigned to a master control lot using CRM 470. Values
are then assigned to the commercial control (human pooled at target
concentration) verses master control using three reference curves, 4 runs, 3
vials, 4 replicates per vial tested on two nephelometric instruments for a total
of 144 measurements.
Standard stability is tested real time for stored at +2 to +8°C and
opened/punctured on board instrument.

d. Detection limit:
The claimed limit of quantification is 0.16
The limit of quantification claim is based on a single lot dependent calibrator,
which is serially diluted into seven levels. The limit of quantification was
empirically calculated based on historical variability of the calibrator. This
was confirmed with analytical sensitivity and functional sensitivity testing.
Confirmed functional sensitivity with a % CV is 0.08 mg/L
Analytical Sensitivity is 0.011mg/L based on the mean value of twenty
replicates of System Diluent plus two standard deviations
e. Analytical specificity:
HIL Interference
The CardioPhase® hsCRP method was evaluated for interference according to
CLSI/NCCLS EP7-A2. Bias is the difference in the results between the
control sample (without the interferent) and the test sample (contains the
interferent) expressed in percent. Bias exceeding 10% is considered
interference.
