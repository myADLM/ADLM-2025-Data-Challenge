L. Test Principle:
The method for the qualitative determination of specific IgG to varicella- zoster virus is
an indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). All assay steps and incubations are
performed by the LIAISON® Analyzer. Varicella-zoster virus antigen is used for coating
magnetic particles (solid phase) and a mouse monoclonal antibody to human IgG is
linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-antibody conjugate). During the first
incubation, anti-VZV IgG antibodies, present in calibrators, samples or controls, bind to
the solid phase. After each incubation, the unbound material is removed with a wash

cycle. During the second incubation, the antibody conjugate reacts with anti-VZV IgG
already bound to the solid phase. Subsequently, the starter reagents are added and a flash
chemiluminescence reaction is induced. The light signal, and the amount to isoluminol-
antibody conjugate, is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is
indicative of the presence of anti-VZV IgG concentration present in calibrators, samples
or controls.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
An assay reproducibility study was conducted at two external US laboratories
and at DiaSorin, according to CLSI document EP15-A2. The study included 3
different kit lots. A coded panel comprised of 9 frozen repository samples was
prepared by DiaSorin and provided to each site for testing by the LIAISON®
VZV IgG assay. The panel contained samples prepared to represent negative
levels, low to mid positive analyte levels and moderate to high positive levels.
All panel members were divided into aliquots and stored frozen prior to
testing. The same coded panel was tested at all three sites, in four replicates
per run for five runs. The results are summarized in the following table.

The cross-reactivity study for the LIAISON® VZV IgG assay was designed to
evaluate potential interference from closely-related members of the herpesviridae
family (EBV, HSV CMV), other organisms that may cause symptoms similar to
VZV infection (Rubella virus, Measles, Mumps), other organisms that may cause
infectious disease (Toxoplasma gondii, Borrelia burgdorferi) and from other
conditions that may result from atypical immune system activity (antinuclear
autoantibodies ANA. Samples for these studies were pre-screened with another
commercially available VZV IgG assay. If found negative for VZV IgG
antibodies they were used for potentially cross-reactive viruses.”

f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off for the LIAISON® VZV IgG assay was determined during
European clinical trials in which 393 samples were tested. The samples
consisted of single samples from different selected populations (subjects never
infected with VZV, routine VZV IgG samples, transplant recipients, pregnant
patients, blood donors and pediatric patients). Based on available clinical and
laboratory data, the samples were classified as expected negative or positive
for VZV IgG and evaluated with the LIAISON® VZV IgG assay. A cut-off of
150 Index was determined to provide the best balance of sensitivity and
specificity for the tested clinical samples. An equivocal zone of 135-165 Index
was applied to the assay to account for normal measurement imprecision.

PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS
A total of 1434 prospectively collected samples of which 689 were from
pregnant women, were tested in the U.S for the presence of VZV IgG
antibodies using the LIAISON® VZV IgG assay and a commercially available
ELISA test kit at two independent sites as well as DiaSorin Inc., Stillwater,
MN. Site #1 is a university hospital laboratory located in Philadelphia, PA and
site #2 is a clinical laboratory located in Minneapolis, MN. Site #1 tested 340
of the routine VZV samples and site #2 tested 405 of the routine VZV
samples. DiaSorin Inc., tested all of the samples from pregnant women. The
following tables compare the results obtained for the LIAISON® VZV IgG
assay and the commercially available ELISA.

4. Expected values/Reference range:
The prevalence of VZV antibodies can vary depending on age, geographical
location, socioeconomic status, race and vaccine usage. The prevalence of VZV
antibodies generally varies from about 15% positive in 2 year olds to about 95%
in persons over 40 years of age. The LIAISON® VZV IgG Assay was tested with
prospectively collected samples from U.S. subjects sent to the laboratory for
varicella- zoster virus testing (n=745) and from pregnant women (n=689) to
evaluate the assays’ performance in these populations. The samples sent to the
laboratory for VZV IgG testing were 71.9% female (536), 27.7% male (206),
0.40% unknown (3) from the Northeastern U.S. The pregnant woman population
was collected from the mid-Atlantic and Northeastern US areas. The distribution
of results for IgG antibodies to varicella-zoster virus in these populations as
determined by the LIAISON® VZV IgG Assay summarized as follows.

N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
WARNINGS:
1. Assay interference due to circulating antibodies against HIV, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B
and Hepatitis C virus, HAMA and Rheumatoid Factor has not been evaluated. The
user is responsible for establishing cross-reactivity performance with these infectious
agents and antibodies.
The recommended LIAISON® VZV IgG quality control material contains a 5% serum
matrix. It may not adequately control the DiaSorin LIAISON® VZV IgG assay for
serum specimens. The user must provide quality control material for serum specimens.
Alternative materials for the control of serum specimens include commercial quality
control materials or your laboratory’s own pooled serum specimens. Choose control
levels that check assay performance at all clinically relevant points (e.g., assay cutoff).
The recommendation is to run a positive and negative control close to the assay’s
decision point. It is the responsibility of the user to validate the use of alternative control
materials with this assay and to establish appropriate control ranges
O. Conclusion:
The submitted material in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
