L. Test Principle:
Polystyrene particles coated with monoclonal antibodies specific to human CRP are
aggregated when mixed with samples containing CRP. These aggregates scatter a
beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is
proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is
evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was done in accordance with CLSI/NCCLS Approved
Guideline for Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Devices: EP5-
A2. Specimens at each level were analyzed in duplicate, twice a day, for 20
days. The repeatability and within-lab standard deviations (SD) and percent
coefficient of variation (%CV) were calculated by the analysis of variance
method. The data are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range if 3.1 – 190 mg/L is based on linearity and method
comparison.
Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by testing serum samples with
high concentrations of CRP. These samples were serially diluted with System
Diluent down to the lower measuring range (171.6 to 4.8 mg/L). Each
dilution was tested in replicates of five. Percent recovery was calculated using
the formula: Mean of test/ expected concentration X 100. All dilutions met
the acceptance criterion of recovery of 80 to 120%.
The linear regression [x-axis: theoretical concentration versus y-axis:
measured concentration] was also calculated. The acceptance criteria of slope
between 0.9 and 1.1 and correlation coefficient ≥0.95 were met. A summary
of the linearity data is presented below.
Slope Intercept Correlation Coefficient
1.041 1.745 0.995
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Standard values are assigned to a master calibrator lot using CRM 470.
Values are then assigned to the commercial calibrator (human pooled at target
concentration) verses master calibrator using three reference curves, 4 runs, 3
vials, 4 replicates per vial tested on two nephelometric instruments for a total
of 144 measurements.
Control values are assigned to a master control lot using CRM 470. Values
are then assigned to the commercial control (human pooled at target
concentration) verses master control using three reference curves, 4 runs, 3
vials, 4 replicates per vial tested on two nephelometric instruments for a total
of 144 measurements.
Standard stability is tested real time for stored at +2 to +8°C and
opened/punctured on board instrument.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection: 3.1 mg/L
The limit of detection represents the lower limit of the reportable range of
CRP based on the sensitivity, functional sensitivity, and historical variability
of the calibrator, which represents the lower cutoff point of the reportable
range of CRP.
e. Analytical specificity:
HIL Interference
The CRP method was evaluated for interference according to CLSI/NCCLS
EP7-A2. Bias is the difference in the results between the control sample
(without the interferent) and the test sample (contains the interferent)
