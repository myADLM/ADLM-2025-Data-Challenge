c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The assigned values of the Chemistry 1 Calibrator were verified
on a Dimension® Vista™ System calibrated with an approved Master Pool.
Master Pool values were assigned on multiple Dimension® clinical chemistry
instruments. According to the sponsor the traceability of the assigned values
of the Chemistry 1 Calibrator was standardized to the below table of assigned
values.

Stability: The target shelf life for the Dimension Vista® Chemistry 1
Calibrator is 12 months. A vial punctured by the instrument and stored on
board has a stability claim of one day. An open vial not stored on the
instrument, but recapped and stored in a refrigerator has a stability claim of 30
days. Stability study protocols and acceptance criteria were described and
found to be acceptable.
