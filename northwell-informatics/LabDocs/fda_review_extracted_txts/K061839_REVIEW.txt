I. Device Description:
Diazotized sulfanilic acid is formed by combining sodium nitrite and sulfanilic
acid at low pH. The sample is diluted in 0.5M HCl. A blank reading is taken to
eliminate interference from nonbilirubin pigments. Upon addition of the
diazotized sulfanilic acid, the conjugated bilirubin is converted to diazo-bilirubin,
a red chromophore which absorbs at 540 nm and is measured using a bichromatic
(540, 700 nm) endpoint technique.

L. Test Principle:
The assay employs a modified diazo method whereby the addition of diazotized
sulfanilic acid to conjugated bilirubin causes a conversion to diazo-bilirubin, which
absorbs at 540 nm. Measurement is performed by a bichromatic endpoint technique.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A twenty day ANOVA study was conducted per CLSI EP5A2. Quality control
materials and serum pools were examined at various concentrations across the
assay range. QC materials and serum pools were examined near 0.4 mg/dL, an
important medical decision level. See attached results.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range of the assay is claimed as 0.05 – 16.0 mg/dL.
Various mixtures (ratios) of the level 2 TDBIL calibrator (lyophilized human
serum based product containing bilirubin), and a low concentration total
bilirubin serum sample were tested. The test results were examined versus the
expected value using linear least squares analysis. See the table below for the
test data, acceptance criteria and data analysis.

commonly ingested substances were tested by spiking a serum sample at a
desired direct bilirubin concentration with the appropriate concentration of the
test substance. The direct bilirubin recovery of the sample was compared to
that of a control sample.
Two base pools of human sera were prepared at direct bilirubin concentrations
of approximately 0.3 mg/dL and 5 mg/dL. Stock solutions of each potential
interfering substance of interest were prepared using the appropriate diluents.
Test samples were prepared by spiking the base pool with the respective
(interferent) stock solutions. Appropriate controls were prepared by spiking
base pool with diluent used to make the stock solution(s). Interference is
calculated as the difference between the mean of the test and the control
sample analyte response.
If the difference in recovery between the test sample and control was less than
10% it was concluded that the substance did not interfere in the method. If
recovery was greater than 10%, the information was included in the
Limitations section of the product insert sheet.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A split sample method comparison was conducted with one hundred fifty
patient samples (118 serum and 32 plasma) using the Dimension® DBIL
(predicate) and Dimension Vista™ assays. The samples were analyzed
randomly in duplicate on the two systems. The model equation for the linear
least squares regression statistics is: [results for Dimension Vista(TM) system]
= slope x [comparative method results] + intercept. Twenty-eight samples
were outside the assay range of one of the analyzers and excluded from the
statistical analysis. A regression slope of 0.971, intercept of 0.01 mg/dL and
correlation coefficient of 0.999 demonstrate good agreement between the
assays. The range of DBIL values in the correlation study was 0.04 to 15.75
mg/dL.
b. Matrix comparison:
A split sample comparison was conducted on two different days with a total of
sixty-four matched serum, EDTA plasma and lithium heparin plasma samples
using the Dimension Vista™ DBIL assay. Different DBIL reagents and
instruments were used on each day of the study. The samples were analyzed in
duplicate. The data was examined using linear least squares analysis. Seven
to nine samples were outside the assay range (depending on the sample type)
and excluded from the statistical analysis. The regression of the mean results
provided slopes that ranged from 0.96 to 1.05, intercepts from -0.33 to 0.06
mg/dL and correlation coefficients of 0.994 to 0.998. The data demonstrate
excellent agreement between the sample types. The range of DBIL values in
the correlation study was 0.1 to 16 mg/dL.
