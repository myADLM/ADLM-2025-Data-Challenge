L. Test Principle:
A mixture containing affinity-purified recombinant antigen MIT3 which includes
immunodominant portions of PDC-E2, BCOADC-E2, and OGDC-E2, a purified
fragment of the sp100 protein, and a purified fragment of the gp100 protein is bound
to the wells of a polystyrene microwell plate under conditions that will preserve the
antigen in their native state. Pre-diluted controls and diluted patient sera are added to
separate wells, allowing any mitochondrial antibodies present to bind to the
immobilized antigen. Unbound sample antibodies are washed away and an enzyme
labeled anti-human IgG/IgA conjugate is added to each well. A second incubation
allows the enzyme labeled anti-human IgG/IgA to bind to any patient antibodies,
which have become attached to the microwells. After washing away any unbound
enzyme labeled anti-human IgG/IgA, the remaining enzyme activity is measured by
adding a chromogenic substrate and measuring the intensity of the color that
develops. The assay can be evaluated spectrophotometrically by measuring and
comparing the color intensity that develops in the patient wells with the color in the
control wells.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The intra-assay precision was determined using seven serum samples, with
PBC Screen concentration levels ranged from 13.6 to 61.6 Units/mL. These
seven samples were tested five times. The positive samples had ≤ 3.7% CV,
and the negative samples had ≤ 2.4% CV as listed below.

The inter-assay precision was determined using eight serum samples in

for three days. The positive samples had ≤ 6.1% CV, and the negative samples
had ≤ 9.2% CV as listed below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
No claims were made regarding linearity for the assay. It is a semi-
quantitative assay with results reported out as negative (0.0 – 20.0 Units),
positive (≥ 25 Units), or equivocal (20.1 – 24.9 Units), when results are
interpreted by comparison to the low positive control value of 25 Units.
Specimens with positive results may be tested for the presence of individual
MIT3, gp210, and sp100 antibodies with MIT3, gp100, and sp100 specific
ELISA assays.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no recognized standard or reference material for antibodies to the
PBC Screen multi-antigen mixture. The positive and negative controls are
prepared in house and arbitrary units are assigned during the development
process.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference by endogenous substances: No data provided. The package insert
states that grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, microbially contaminated, heat-treated,
or specimens containing visible particulate should be avoided in this assay.
Crossreactivity study to other autoantibodies was performed. Results were
under in section for ‘Clinical specificity’.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off value of 25 units/mL for the PBC Screen IgG/ IgA assay was
established from a combined panel of 1012 specimens collected from 520
asymptomatic healthy individuals and 492 patients with a variety of non-PBC
diseases, i.e. 29 autoimmune and infectious diseases: 3 anti-Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (ASCA), 4 antinuclear antibody (ANA), 3 tissue transglutaminase
antibody (tTg), 2 gastric parietal antibody (GPA), 2 glomerular basement
membrane antibody (GBM), 7 Helicobacter pylori, and 8 cytomegalovirus
(CMV); 213 autoimmune hepatitis (AIH); 48 Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis
(PSC); 10 AIH/PSC; 8 autoimmune cholangitis (AIC); 9 cryptogenic
hepatitis; 1 drug-induced hepatitis; 11 vanishing bile duct syndrome (VBDS);
71 HBV; 78 HCV; 3 autoimmune hepatitis type 2; 11 alcoholic liver disease.
Using the 25 units/mL cut-off, 98.1% (510/520) of the normal samples were

negative. Of the non-PBC samples, 89% (438/492) were negative. If the
possible undiagnosed overlap syndromes (AIH/PCS, VBDS, AIC, cryptogenic
hepatitis, AIH, and AMA-negative PBC) were excluded from the non-PBC
group, 92% (229/249) of the samples were negative.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate:
A total of 1209 specimens from seven clinical sites, were tested on PBC
Screen IgG/IgA ELISA assay and the individual MIT3, gp210 and sp100
ELISA assays. The samples consisted of 440 PBC (426 definite PBC and 14
AIH/PBC overlap); 48 PSC; 149 viral hepatitis (HBV or HCV); 23 non-PBC
liver diseases; 29 infectious or other autoimmune diseases, and 520 healthy
individuals. Equivocals were excluded from the percent agreement
calculations. Results are summarized below.

The same samples in the method comparison study were used for the
determination of clinical sensitivity and specificity. Equivocal results were
included as negative. The sensitivity was 95.9% (422/440) and the specificity
was 96.1% (739/769).

disease.
b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. is not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Same as assay cut-off.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Expected values in the normal population should be negative.
A panel of 520 asymptomatic, healthy individuals residing in the USA was tested
with the PBC Screen IgG/IgA assay and with the three individual MIT3, gp210,
sp100 ELISA assays. Age and gender data were available for 307 specimens and
unavailable for the remaining specimens. The samples were from 150 male and
157 female subjects with age ranging from 18-78 years. The average PBC Screen
value for this population was 6.6 units with a median value of 4.6 units. The PBC
Screen IgG/IgA assay had a specificity of 98.1% (510/520). The 10 positive
samples with PBC Screen assay had the following results: one sample had 105
units and showed a classic AMA staining on HEp-2 cells by IFA whereas the
other 9 positive had values ranging from 28-46 units. On further testing, one of
these 10 specimen did not have sufficient serum, 6 were positive and 1 equivocal
with the MIT3 IgG assay, one sample was negative with all three individual
assays, and one was negative with the gp210 and sp100 assays but positive with
the MIT3 assay only. Since these were donor samples, it is not possible to verify
the true clinical status of the reactive specimens.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
