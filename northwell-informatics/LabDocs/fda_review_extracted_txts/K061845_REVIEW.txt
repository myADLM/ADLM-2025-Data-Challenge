L. Test Principle:
Proteins contained in human body fluids form immune complexes in an
immunochemical reaction with specific antibodies. These complexes scatter a beam
of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional
to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by
comparison with a standard of known concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing was done in accordance with CLSI document EP5-A,
‘Approved Guideline for Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical
Devices’. The intra-assay reproducibility was determined by testing seven
samples in duplicate twice a day for 20 days. The samples included the L, M
and H controls (IgM concentration of 0.567, 0.682, and 0.894 g/L
respectively), two serum pools (IgM concentrations of 0.294 and 4.717 g/L)
and two plasma pools (IgM concentrations of 0.631 and 1.980 g/L). The
controls had %CV ranging from 1.8% to2.9%, the serum pools 3.0% to 4.8%
and the plasma pools 2.9% to 3.0%.
The inter-assay reproducibility was determined by testing the same seven
samples in duplicate twice a day for 20 days. The %CV for the controls
ranged from 2.0% to 3.6 %, the sera pools 3.6% to 4.8% and the plasma pools
3.3% to 3.8%. The data are summarized below:
Material Mean Intra-assay Inter-assay
g/L SD (%CV) SD (%CV)
PROT 1 CON L 0.567 0.017 (2.9) 0.021 (3.6)
PROT 1 CON M 0.682 0.016 (2.3) 0.020 (3.0)
PROT 1 CON H 0.894 0.016 (1.8) 0.018 (2.0)
Serum pool 0.294 0.014 (4.8) 0.014 (4.8)
Serum pool 4.717 0.140 (3.0) 0.172 (3.6)
Plasma pool 0.631 0.019 (3.0) 0.024 (3.8)
Plasma pool 1.980 0.058 (2.9) 0.065 (3.3)
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by testing a serum sample
with high concentration (6.7 g/L) of IgM. This sample was serially diluted 12
times with System Diluent down to the lower measuring range (0.35 g/L).
Each dilution was tested in replicates of five. Percent recovery was calculated
using the formula: (Mean of test/expected concentration) x 100. All dilutions
met the acceptance criteria of 80 to 120% with a mean recovery of 98.1%.
The linear regression analysis was performed. The acceptance criteria of slope
between 0.9 and 1.1 and correlation of coefficient ≥0.95 were met. Data
showed a regression equation y = 0.9852x – 0.0203, r2 of 0.9986. Linearity

was observed between 0.33 to 6.70 g/L.
Reportable range for the device was set at 0.21 – 6.4 g/L
Antigen Excess Effect:
The possibility of antigen excess occurring when using the device was
evaluated with serum sample above the assay range. The sample was analyzed
on both the BN ProSpec® System and the Dimension Vista™ instrument,
indicating no antigen excess effect up to 49.558 g/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrator is traceable to the reference material IFCC/BCR/CAP CRM
470.
Stability
The expiration date claims for the reagents are as follows:
Unopened reagent cartridges and closed vials:
Dimension Vista™ IgM Flex® reagent cartridge (IGM) – 24 month
Dimension Vista™ Protein 1 Calibrator – 24 months
Dimension Vista™ Protein 1 Control L, M and H – 24 months
On-board Instrument products:
Dimension Vista™ IgM Flex® reagent sealed cartridge (IGM) – 90 days
Dimension Vista™ IgM Flex® open well reagent cartridge (IGM) – 21 days
Dimension Vista™ Protein 1 Calibrator open vial – 9 days
Dimension Vista™ Protein 1 Control L, M and H open vial – 14 days
d. Detection limit:
Detection limit (0.21 g/L) represents the lower limit of the reportable range of
IgM.
The analytical sensitivity is defined as the minimal detectable level of analyte,
which can be distinguished from zero. The value was calculated as the mean
value of twenty replicates of 1:20 dilution of PROT 1 Cal and system diluent
plus two standard deviations. It was determined to be 0.02 g/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed according to CLSI document EP7A,
‘Interference testing in Clinical Chemistry’ guidance. No significant
interference was observed in the presence of the following interferents:
Bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated) up to 60 mg/dL, Hemoglobin up to
750 mg/dL, Triglycerides up to 924 mg/dL, Creatinine up to 30 mg/dL,
Albumin up to 6 g/L, Immunoglobulin G (IgG) up to 5 g/L, Urea up to 500
mg/dL, Cholesterol up to 500 mg/dL, Uric Acid 20 mg/dL, Rheumatoid factor
up to 500 IU/mL, Total Protein up to 12 g/L.
Non-interfering substances section of the device package insert provides a list
of drugs and other exogenous substances that do not interfere with the assay.

b. Matrix comparison:
Sera and plasma (lithium and sodium heparin) samples, covering the IgM
assay measuring range (0.41 – 6.20 g/L) were compared to determine if any
significant bias existed between matrices. The correlation coefficients were
acceptable and no bias was observed. Regression analyses of the comparison
results are summarized below:

** The range of IgM values in the correlation study was 0.42-6.19 g/L
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and specificity:
Not Applicable
b. Other clinical supportive data:
Not Applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The reported expected range for the Immunoglobulin M (IgM) in adults (0.4 – 2.3
g/L) is from literature (Dati F, Schumann G, Thomas L, et al. Consensus of a
group of professional societies and diagnostic companies on guidelines for interim
reference ranges for 14 proteins in serum based on the standardization against the
IFCC/BCR/CAP Reference Material (CRM 470). Eur J Clin Chem Clin Biochem
34: 517-20, 1996).
During childhood and adolescence, reference ranges for IgM are dependent on
age and can vary over a wide range.
Each laboratory should establish its own expected values for IgM since values
may differ depending on the population studied.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
