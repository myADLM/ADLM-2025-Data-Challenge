K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI Guideline EP12A, User Protocol for Evaluation of Qualitative Test
Performance.
L. Test Principle:
When a strip is moved into the measuring position under the optical unit, the test
strip is illuminated by white light and the reflected light from the reagent strip is
detected by a colour CCD sensor. The picture, which has been taken by the CCD
camera, is evaluated and the result is divided into values for the red, green and
blue colour for each test pad. Afterwards, these RGB-values are used in
mathematical algorhythms to transform them into a meaningful concentration for
the user.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To evaluate the performance of the system, the following evaluations were
carried out:
• precision within-series (20 measurements with one LOT/one
instrument)
• precision LOT-to-LOT (10 measurements with three LOTs/one
instrument)
• precision instrument-to-instrument (10 measurements with three
instruments/one LOT)

The precision was evaluated by using the urine dipstick control materials
by Quantimetrix.
It is available as a 2 level set (level 1: normal, level 2: abnormal). The
Quantimetrix dipstick control does not contain ascorbic acid. Therefore,
the ascorbic acid test pad performance was evaluated by using human pool
urine: a) negative, b) positive=spiked with 20 mg/dl ascorbic acid. The
results are presented below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
No information on traceability was provided.
Stability:
Test strips: The shelf life of the unopened test strips is 24 months.
Investigations were done with three lots at an age of 24, 25 and 26 months
using Quantimetrix “the dipper”, human urine spiked with ascorbic acid.
The performance data were verified to support the stability claim.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit was established at concentrations where at least 50% of
the observed results were positive when assayed using the Combi Scan
100. The table below presents the detection limits for each analyte on the
Combi Scan 100 using the Combi-Screen 11 SYS urine test strips.
Parameter Detection Limit
Combi Scan 100
Ascorbic acid 15 mg/dL
Bilirubin 0,6 mg/dL
Blood 6-8 Ery/μL (as Hb.)
Glucose 40 - 50 mg/dL
Ketones 4 - 6 mg/dL
Leucocytes 15 Leu/uL
Nitrite 0,1 mg/dL
Protein 20 - 30 mg/dL
Urobilinogen 1,5 mg/dL
e. Analytical specificity:
The interference from ascorbic acid was determined using 5 patient urine
samples and ascorbic acid concentrations of 0, 20, 40 and 80 mg/dL. The
following were observed:
Bilirubin at 1 mg/dL and 2 mg/dL:
False low or negative results were observed at 80 mg/dL of vitamin C.
Blood:
When testing solutions with 25 Ery/uL (as Hb) and 50 Ery/uL (as Hb), no
negative results were observed with ascorbic acid concentrations up to 80

mg/dL. When testing at 10 Ery/uL (as Hb), 1 negative result out of 5 was
observed with an ascorbic acid concentration of 20 mg/dL, zero out of 5
were negative with an ascorbic acid concentration of 40 mg/dL and 2 out
of 5 were negative with an ascorbic acid concentration of 80 mg/dL.
Glucose:
When testing glucose at 100 mg/dL with an ascorbic acid concentration of
20 mg/dL 5 out of 5 results showed 1+ rather than 2+. At 40 and 80
mg/dL of ascorbic acid, glucose values for 50 and 100 mg/dL were falsely
low or negative.
Nitrite:
At 80mg/dL of ascorbic acid nitrite results were negative rather than
positive..

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The Combi Scan 100 was compared to the Clinitek 50 and Miditron by
using 112 human urine samples. The ascorbic acid test pad is not present at
the predicative devices. For that reason, the ascorbic acid test was
compared to a photometric determination of ascorbic acid.
The data were evaluated by using contingency tables. In some cases, the
concentration levels are not exactly the same for the Combi Scan 100,
Clinitek 50 and Miditron. In these cases, the lower and higher
concentrations, which are close to the mentioned concentration, were used
as “same colour block”. The colour blocks besides these blocks were
evaluated as “+/- 1 colour block”. The following agreements were
observed:

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected values are provided in the strip labeling from literature.
N. Instrument Name:
Combi Scan 100
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Single step or continuous testing
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes ____X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
The patient ID is entered manually by internal numpad, external keyboard, or
external barcode reader.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The test strip is dipped into the urine manually and placed on the conveyor
belt for a reading by the instrument.
5. Calibration:
There is no special calibration procedure to be carried out by the user.
6. Quality Control:
In the labeling the applicant recommends the use of external urine dipstick
