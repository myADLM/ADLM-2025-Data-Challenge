K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI EP5-A2, CLSI EP9-A2, CLSI EP7-A2.
L. Test Principle:
The method used for quantitative measurement of C3 and C4 is
immunonephelometry. The samples when mixed with reagents (automatically done
by the instrument) in the cartridge an immunological reaction results in forming an
immune complexes with C3 or C4 contained in the sample. A light beam is passed
through the complex and the intensity of light scattering is measured at 840nm. The
intensity of scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the respective
analyte in the sample. C3 or C4 concentrations are automatically calculated by the
instrument from the multiple calibration curves.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed according to CLSI EP5-A2. During each day of
testing two separate samples for each test material were analyzed for 20 days. For
C3, samples tested included 4 serum pools and 3 controls (low, medium and
high). For C4, 3 controls (L, M, H), 2 plasma samples and 2 serum samples with
different analyte concentrations. The acceptance criteria are shown below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the assay range was determined by testing serial dilutions of a
high C3 and a high C4 sample over the assay measuring range. Each dilution was
tested in replicates of five. Percent recovery was calculated as mean of
observed/expected concentration x 100. The mean percents recovery for C3 and
C4 were 94.9% (ranged from 87.2% to 100%) and 99.5% (ranged from 92.7% to
104.1%). Linear regression analysis showed for C3, the slope was 0.989, the
intercept was -0.0332 and r2 of 0.999. For C4, the slope was 1.0108, intercept was
-0.0019 and r2 0.9996.
Measuring range (reportable range): for C3 = 0.16-4.1 g/L for initial 1:20 dilution
of samples that are automatically processed by the instrument. Samples with
results in excess of 4.1g/L can be repeated on a higher dilution (1:200). Samples
with results less than 0.16 g/L can be repeated on a lower dilution (1:5). Samples
with results less than 0.04 g/L will be reported as “less than 0.04 g/L” by the
instrument.
For Compliment 4 the measuring range is 0.06-1.6 g/L. This is the measuring
range for the initial 1:10 dilution of samples that are automatically processed by
the instrument. Samples with excess of 1.6 g/L can be repeated on a higher
dilution (1:100). Samples with results less than 0.06 g/L can be repeated on a
lower dilution (1:2.5). Samples less than 0.015 g/L will be reported as “less than
0.015 g/L” by the instrument.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Reference standard used was ERM®-DA470 (CRM 470). C3 and C4 values of
the master lots of the calibrator and controls are assigned against the reference
standard.

The detection limits was determined by assaying the diluent and Cal 1 twenty
times each. The analytical sensitivity for C3 was 0.047 g/L and 0.003 g/L for C4.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interferences by endogenous substances namely conjugated bilirubin (60 mg/dL),
unconjugated bilirubin (60 mg/dL), creatinine (30 mg/dL), hemoglobin (1000
mg/dL), IgG (5 g/dL), albumin (6 g/dL), urea (500 mg/dL), cholesterol (500
mg/dL), uric acid (20 mg/dL) and triglycerides (924 mg/dL) were spiked into
aliquots of a serum sample and assayed for C3 and C4. The spiked samples were
compared to the unspiked sample and % recoveries were calculated. The
acceptance criterion for % recovery was ±10%. Results showed no interference at
the concentrations tested. Interference due to RF and total protein was also
determined and no significant interference was observed.
In addition, drug interference was assessed. No observable interference with the
drugs tested.
f. Assay cut-off:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison between Dimension Vista and BN ProSpec was performed on
116 samples for C3 (58 serum and plasma n=58). Passing-Bablock regression
analysis yielded a slope of 0.960 (95% CI: 0.943, 0.975) and intercept of 0.041
(95%CI: 0.016, 0.069).
For C4, 66 serum samples and 60 plasma samples were tested. Passing-Bablock
analysis of the results yielded a slope of 1.041 (95% CI: 1.025, 1.059) and
intercept 0.006 (95%CI: 0.001, 0.016).
b. Matrix comparison:
Anti-coagulant effects were evaluated using 10 samples, comparing serum and
plasma (lithium heparin and sodium heparin) with C3 concentrations ranging
from 0.31-3.96 g/L. Linear regression analysis was performed and results are
summarized below.
