L. Test Principle:
Glucose
Glucose in the serum sample is phosphorylated by hexokinase using excess adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) in the presence of magnesium ions to glucose-6-phosphate.
Glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized in the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD) by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) to 6-phosphogluconate
and NADH which is measured at 340 nm and is proportional to the amount of glucose
present.

BUN
Urea is converted to ammonia and CO by the enzyme urease. The ammonia
2
produced is utilized by glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) to convert alpha-
ketoglutarate (α-KG) to glutamic acid, with the concomitant conversion of NADH to
NAD which is measured at 340 nm, and is proportional to the amount of BUN
present.
Sodium, Potassium and Chloride
The ISE Module of the SDI CA480 utilizes Ion Selective Electrode technology. The
flow-through Sodium electrode uses selective membrane tubing, formulated to be
sensitive to Sodium ions. The Potassium and Chloride electrodes employ similar
designs with appropriate selective membrane materials. The potential of each
electrode is measured relative to a fixed, stable voltage established by the double-
junction silver / silver chloride reference electrode. An ion selective electrode
develops a voltage that varies with the concentration of the ion to which it responds.
The relationship between the voltage developed and the concentration of the sensed
ion is logarithmic, as expressed by the Nernst equation:
nF
Ex = Es + log(Cα)
RT
