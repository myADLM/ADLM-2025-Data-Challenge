The Actim PROM test is a visually interpreted, qualitative
immunochromatographic rapid test for the detection of amniotic fluid in
cervicovaginal secretions during pregnancy. Actim PROM test detects IGFBP-1,
which is a major protein in amniotic fluid and a marker of the presence of
amniotic fluid in a cervicovaginal sample. The test is intended for professional
use to help diagnose the rupture of fetal membranes (ROM) in pregnant women at
>34 weeks gestation when patients report signs, symptoms or complaints
suggestive of ROM or if such signs are otherwise observed.
The Actim PROM Controls are intended for use as external controls with the
Actim PROM test. The controls may also be used to demonstrate negative results
and weak and strong positive results.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The device is intended for use in point-of-care and clinical laboratory settings.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Samples (control solutions in specimen extraction solution) containing six
different IGFBP-1 concentration levels were evaluated for repeatability /
intra-assay precision. The levels represented negative, weakly positive and
strongly positive samples. The samples were tested with 10 replicates each
during the same day using 3 different lots of the Actim PROM test.
Repeatable results were obtained. These test results were consistent with the
detection limit of the assay.
Samples (control solutions in specimen extraction solution) containing ten
different IGFBP-1 concentration levels were evaluated for reproducibility /
inter-assay precision. The levels represented negative, weakly positive and
strongly positive samples. The samples were tested with 3 replicates each on
7 days using 3 different lots of the Actim PROM test. Reproducible results
were obtained. These test results were consistent with the detection limit of
the assay.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The measuring range of the Actim PROM test is approximately 25 μg/L –
500,000 μg/L in an extracted sample.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The positive controls consist of purified human insulin-like growth factor
binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) with bovine serum albumin and preservative.
The positive controls are prepared by adding hIGFBP-1 antigen to the
negative control solution. The solutions are then adjusted to the following
concentration ranges using IGFBP-1 quantitative ELISA: 40 μg/L (34-46
μg/L) for the low positive control and 250 μg/L (212-287 μg/L) for the high
positive control.
The IGFBP-1 antigen in the Positive Controls has been shown to be negative
for HBsAG, HIV type 1 and 2 antibodies, HCV and syphilis. However, such
tests are unable to prove the complete absence of viruses, and therefore the
controls should be treated as potentially infectious.
To test closed stability, controls are tested at the time of manufacture and after
the designated storage times at the specified temperatures. For each time
point, testing is performed with one lot of Actim PROM test using three
4

--- Page 5 ---
replicate dipsticks. The expected positive and negative results were obtained
in all cases.
To test open stability, studies of the reconstituted controls were performed
after 25 hours storage at three different temperatures (2-8°C, 25°C, and 30°C)
and also after 4, 7, and 8 days storage at 2-8°C. For both studies, testing was
performed with three lots of Actim PROM Controls and with three lots of
Actim PROM tests. The expected positive and negative results were obtained
in all cases and support the stated open stability of Actim PROM Controls.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity was evaluated using specimens with 13 different
concentrations of IGFBP-1 ranging from 0 μg/L – 500,000 μg/L. The samples
were control solutions in Specimen Extraction Solution and were tested with 3
different lots of the Actim PROM test. With each lot, 10 replicates were
tested at concentrations around the detection limit and 3 replicates were tested
at higher concentrations. The analytical sensitivity or detection limit is
approximately 25 μg/L of IGFBP-1 in extracted sample, which corresponds to
approximately 400 μg/L in the unextracted sample.
e. Analytical specificity:
The analytical specificity (cross-reactivity) was tested with human IGFBP
proteins at concentrations ranging from 10 - 5,000 μg/L of each protein in
extracted sample. Additionally, control solutions containing 0 – 1,000 μg/L of
human IGFBP-1 were tested. The samples were tested with 3 different lots
using 3 replicates from each test. The results showed that the Actim PROM
test is specific for IGFBP-1. No cross-reactivity was observed using human
IGFBP-2, -3, -4, -5 and -6 proteins.
The effect of drugs, semen, whole blood, urine from pregnant women, shower
and bath products, and other vaginal products were assessed for potential
interference. Samples with and without drug preparations were collected and
extracted into Specimen Extraction Solution containing 0 - 1,000 μg/L of
IGFBP-1. Semen samples were collected and extracted into Specimen
Extraction Solution containing 0 – 100 μg/L of IGFBP-1. Blood samples
were spiked with 0 – 500 μg/L of IGFBP-1, corresponding to the
concentration of blood in pregnant women, then extracted into Specimen
Extraction Solution containing 0 and 50 μg/L of IGFBP-1. Urine samples
(10) from pregnant women were collected and extracted into Specimen
Extraction Solution containing 0 – 100 μg/L of IGFBP-1. Solutions (0.1%) of
common shower and bath products were collected and extracted into
Specimen Extraction Solution containing 0 and 50 μg/L of IGFBP-1. Five
different concentrations each of other substances used in the vaginal area were
5

--- Page 6 ---
extracted into the Specimen Extraction Solution containing 0 and 100 μg/L of
IGFBP-1.
Three different lots of Actim PROM were used for testing. The results were
interpreted after 5 minutes. No interference of vaginal formulations, semen,
whole blood, urine from pregnant women, and shower, bath, and other vaginal
products with the performance of Actim PROM was observed.
f. Assay cut-off:
See detection limit above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The performance of the Actim PROM test was evaluated in comparison with
the predicate device. Vaginal secretions samples were collected from non-
pregnant women and spiked with different concentrations of amniotic fluid.
One hundred samples (100) were tested with both devices.
Test results for the subject device were reported as positive, negative, or
indeterminate for very weak (trace) test lines. Test results for the predicate
device were reported as positive or negative.
The samples contained various IGFBP-1 concentrations ranging from
approximately 4 μg/L to approximately 6,000 μg/L. The percent agreement
between the devices for the positive results was 80%. The percent agreement
for the negative results was 100%. Overall agreement was 86%.

The sponsor provided published studies to support clinical performance of the
Actim PROM in the hands of intended end users under the intended
conditions of use.
In one study by Ragosch et al (1996), samples were collected from forty-four
(44) cases of suspected rupture and thirty-one (31) with intact membranes for
testing on the Actim PROM device. The gestational age of the patients was
up to 41 weeks. Women with over 8 hours between the examination and
membrane rupture, strong bleeding, or cerclage were excluded. Upon further
examination, forty (40) were diagnosed as having intact membranes and
thirty-five (35) as having ruptured membranes.
In another study by Jain and Morris (1998), samples were collected from
patients with admission history of premature rupture of membranes (i.e.,
suspected rupture). One hundred (100) patients up to 42 weeks gestation were
included. Women presenting with obvious flooding of amniotic fluid were
excluded from the study. The final diagnosis of membrane status indicated
that seventy-five (75) were intact and twenty-five (25) were ruptured.
The results from the two studies are as follows:
N Sensitivity Estimate Specificity Estimate
Ragosch et al 75 35/35 = 100% 33/40 = 82.5%
Jain and Morris 100 25/25 = 100% 67/75 = 89%
Combined 175 60/60 = 100% 100/115 = 87%
95% CI 94% to 100% 79.4% to 92.5%
PPV NPV
Combined 175 60/75 = 80% 100/100 = 100%
95% CI 69% to 88% 96.4% to 100%
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected values were determined in literature studies. The IGFBP-1
concentration in amniotic fluid is between 10,500 and 350,000 μg/L (Rutanen et
al. 1993).
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
