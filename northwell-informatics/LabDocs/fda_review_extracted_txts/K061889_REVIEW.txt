The OIA ShigaTox test is an optical immunoassay. This technology enables the
direct visual detection of a physical change in the optical thickness of molecular thin
films. The change is the result of antigen-antibody binding on an optical surface
(silicon wafer). In this device, the biological capture film is a combination of affinity
–purified polyclonal antibodies to Stx 1 & 2 relative. Samples suspected of containing
either or both of the toxins are mixed with reagents containing polyclonal antibodies
to Stx 1 & 2 conjugated to HRP. Once a sample containing toxins or either toxin is
applied to the surface, the immune complex of toxins and the anti-toxin-HRP
conjugate are bound to the surface antibodies. Following a wash step, a precipitating
substrate for HRP is added, and a thin film generated by the immobilized immune
complex is enhanced by the precipitation of the HRP product. Once washed and
dried, a simple color change relative to the gold background color is observed as a
purple spot on the gold background indicating the presence of Stx 1 or 2. If antigen is
not present in the specimen, no binding takes place, optical thickness remains
unchanged and the surface retains the original gold color indicating a negative result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility studies were performed using a masked method at each of the
three Clinical Trial sites and three Point-of-Care sites. A panel of 27
randomly ordered and blinded fecal specimens, spiked with negative, low and
moderate levels of Toxin 1 and/or Toxin 2 were provided and tested on 3
successive days by each of the 6 sites. The specimens produced expected
results with the OIA SHIGATOX test (486/486) 100% of the time.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
N/A
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
N/A
d. Detection limit:
To determine the analytical sensitivity, 2 fold serial dilutions of purified Stx 1
or Stx2 toxins were prepared. Dilutions were then spiked into buffer and the
spiked samples were tested in triplicate. The limit of detection (LOD) was
defined as the lowest toxin concentration producing at least 2 positive results
of the 3 tests or at least 50% of the total number of samples tested. In liquid
stool the LOD for each toxin was determined to be 1ng/ml. 5 samples at each
concentration were analyzed on 2 lots of devices.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross Reactivity Study

--- Page 5 ---
Bacteria at 1x108 orgs/mLwere tested with and without spiking with 2.5
ng/mL of Stx1 and 2.5 ng/mL of Stx2. Cryptosporidium and Giardia were
tested at 1x 106 cysts/mL and Candida albicans was tested at 9.3 x 107
cells/mL. At one clinical site, 3 specimens positive for Rota virus were also
tested and were negative by OIA. All members of the cross reactivity panel
produced the expected negative result without the toxin spike and the
expected positive result with the toxin spike. Organisms tested were as
follows:
Aeromonas hydrophila Giardia lamblia
Klebsiella pneumoniae
Bacillus cereus
Bacillus subtilis Peptostreptococcus anaerobius
Bacteroides fragilis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica
Bifidobacterium adolescentis Proteus vulgaris
Campylobacter fetus Providencia rettgeri

Citrobacter freundii Salmonella enteriditis
Clostridium botulinum Type A Salmonella typhi
Clostridium butyricum Salmonella typhimurium
Clostridium histolyticum Serratia liquefaciens
Clostridium innocuum Serratia marcescens
Clostridium novyi Shigella flexneri Serotype 1A
Clostridium perfringens Shigella sonnei
Clostridium septicum Staphylococcus aureus
Clostridium sordellii Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I
Clostridium subterminale Staphylococcus epidermidis
Clostridium tetani Staphylococcus saprophyticus
Cryptosporidium parvum Veillonella parvula
Enterobacter aerogenes Vibrio cholerae
Enterobacter cloacae Vibrio parahaemolyticus
Enterococcus faecalis Yersinia enterocolitica
Escherichia coli (non-STEC)
In addition, one clinical trial site tested three stools in the OIA SHIGATOX assay
that were positive in a commercial lateral flow, EIA assay for Rotavirus. All 3
samples were negative in the OIA SHIGATOX assay as expected.
Interfering substances Study
The OIA SHIGATOX assay was tested with whole blood, mucin, liquid
Imodium AD, Pepto Bismol, Kaopectate and barium sulfate to determine
potential interference. Each interferent was mixed with antigen diluent or a
liquid or semisolid stool specimen and tested with the assay. Final

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A prospective study was conducted at 3 clinical trial sites in the Eastern,
southern and Western regions of the USA to compare performance of the
BioStar OIA SHIGATOX to a commercial EIA test. A total of 272
prospective specimens from diarrheal patients were tested. Testing consisted
of direct stool testing, Mac Conkey broth culture testing as well as testing
from Sorbitol MacConkey plates (SMAC). All positive results from either of
the 2 immunoassays were confirmed by cytotoxicity testing CTA.
Swab Sampling of Colonies from a Culture Plate (Colony Sweep
Method)
One clinical site evaluated twenty two frozen fecal specimens in a colony
sweep procedure. These samples were previously found to contain Shiga
toxin producing E. coli. All samples were streaked onto XLD (xylose
lysine deoxycholate) plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. One sample
failed to produce any growth. A sterile rayon swab was used to sweep the
first and second quadrants of the growth area and was then immersed into
a reaction tube containing 3 drops each of Reagents 1 and 2 and the
standard assay protocol followed. The OIA SHIGATOX assay detected
21/21 of the colony sweeps that produced growth for 100% agreement
with the previous specimen result.
Direct Stool
A prospective study was conducted at three clinical trial sites in the
Eastern, Southern and Western regions of the United States to compare the
performance of the BioStar OIA SHIGATOX to a commercial EIA test.
Sites analyzed the stool specimens collected for direct testing from the
stool sample by both assays and then placed an aliquot of the stool in
MacConkey broth within 48 hours of specimen collection. Broth cultures
were incubated for 20 – 30 hours and then tested by both immunoassays.
A SMAC culture (Sorbitol MacConkey plates) was also plated within 48
hours of the specimen collection for the determination of E. coli O157.
All positive results from either immunoassay method were confirmed by
cytotoxicity testing, CTA.

SMAC Culture
Two hundred and sixty nine (269) of the direct stool samples were
analyzed by SMAC culture. The OIA SHIGATOX and EIA assays were
compared to the SMAC culture results. Interpretation of the comparison
between the OIA SHIGATOX or the EIA test and SMAC is confounded
by the fact that, as a metabolic test, SMAC is specific for E. coli O157:H7,
while OIA SHIGATOX reacts with all Shiga toxin-producing E. coli
(STEC). Also, SMAC requires the presence of live cells in the sample,
while the OIA SHIGATOX test does not have that limitation. Based on
these differences, it was anticipated that a number of samples could be
SMAC-negative and OIA SHIGATOX positive.

The one apparent OIA false negative result compared to the SMAC result
was not confirmed by CTA and was not positive by EIA. Of the 8
apparent false positives by the OIA method, 4 of the samples were
positive by CTA. The second EIA false negative result was positive by
CTA and the OIA method. One of the OIA +/SMAC + samples was
negative by CTA. The 2 EIA -/SMAC + samples were negative by CTA
and one of the samples was negative by the OIA method as well. Three of
the EIA +/SMAC – samples were positive by CTA and the OIA method.
The remaining EIA +/SMAC – sample was negative by CTA but positive
by the OIA method.
In addition, two of the clinical sites conducted a prospective comparison
of the OIA method to SMAC culture using frozen samples. Thawed
aliquots of all samples were tested in the OIA and SMAC methods for this
comparison.

CTA
In the clinical study there were 19 specimens positive by OIA, EIA, or
both methods. An aliquot of the stool specimen for each of these 19
specimens was submitted for CTA along with an aliquot of the broth
culture media. One sample produced an inconclusive result and was
excluded from this analysis. Thirteen of the samples were positive by
CTA. The OIA SHIGATOX detected 12 of these 13 samples while the
EIA method detected 11. Twelve of the broth aliquots were positive by
CTA. The OIA SHIGATOX assay detected all 12 of these samples as did
the EIA method. Of the 13 CTA positives, SMAC was positive for only 8
samples.

Major outbreaks of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) are usually considered
local, appearing in a specific area and requiring concentrated investigation by
public health personnel. Prevalence rates may therefore vary greatly based on a
number of factors, including geographic location, patient demographics, sampling
and testing methodology. The increasing role of non-O157:H7 strains has further
confounded prevalence estimates.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
