I. Device Description:
The device contains a semiconductor oxide sensor to detect the presence of alcohol.
The display window displays the alcohol concentration or characters. The alcohol
concentration is displayed in increments of 0.01% in the range 0.00% to 0.39% BAC.
Characters are used to instruct the user and display the status of the device. The
device also includes a beeper to give the user audible prompts.
To use the device, the power on/off button is depressed. The device will turn on and
the display will show a countdown to indicate the warm-up. When ready for use the
device will show a “READY” light. Users are instructed to exhale sharply and
steadily into the mouthpiece for at least four seconds. The device will display WAIT
again while it calculates the blood alcohol level. The display will then show the blood
alcohol level; after 15 seconds, the device will turn off automatically.
Two replaceable 1.5V AA batteries power the device.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
The sponsor states conformance to the following standards:
Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
[NHTSA 59 FR 39382] Highway Safety Programs; Model Specifications for
Screening Devices to Measure Alcohol in Bodily Fluids
IEC 61326, Electrical equipment for measurement, control and laboratory use – EMC
requirements
L. Test Principle:
The device contains a semiconductor oxide sensor to detect the presence of alcohol.
In the absence of alcohol, while the heater is warming up, oxygen molecules in the air
are chemisorbed on the surface of the particles, trapping the electrons in the semi
conducting material. When it is exposed to an organic vapor such as ethanol, the
chemisorbed oxygen is reduced and releases the trapped electrons. The flow of
electrons causes a decrease of resistance, which is measured and converted to %
BAC.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision and accuracy of this device has been demonstrated through
testing required by the US Department of Transportation in 59 FR 39382
(Alcohol Screening Devices). For precision and accuracy, these requirements
(referred to as Model Specifications for Screening Devices to Measure
Alcohol in Bodily Fluids) consist of 20 trials at a Blood Alcohol
Concentration (BAC) of 0.008, 20 trials at a BAC of 0.032, and 20 trials at a
BAC of 0.000. Blood Alcohol Concentrations are simulated in breath by a
Breath Alcohol Sample Simulator (BASS), which provides an alcohol-in-air
test sample with known alcohol concentrations, flow rate, and air
composition. The acceptance criteria for the Model Specifications are: not
more than one negative result at 0.032 BAC, not more than one positive result
at 0.008 BAC, and not more than one negative greater than zero and no
positives at 0.000 BAC. NOTE: for the purposes of this study, a BAC of 0.020
is used to distinguish a positive from a negative result. The AL-5000 device
had no negatives at 0.032 BAC, no positives at 0.008 BAC, and no positives
or non-zero negatives at 0.000 BAC.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
This device reports concentrations from 0.00% to 0.39%. However, DOT
Model Specifications require accuracy testing at concentrations of 0.000,
0.008 and 0.032 BAC only; therefore true linearity was not evaluated. This
device demonstrated acceptable performance according to the DOT Model
Specifications as described above.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device is traceable to a commercially available certified alcohol reference
solution at a concentration of 0.05% BAC & 0.10% BAC. This solution is
used to calibrate the devices during manufacture.
d. Detection limit:
The DOT Model Specifications for screening devices do not specifically
address the detection limit of breath alcohol devices. However, the devices
must be tested at a BAC of zero (blank reading) to assess the possibility of
false positives. This consists of 20 trials under normal laboratory conditions at
a BAC of 0.000. Non-alcoholic human breath is to be used as the sample. For
devices capable of providing a reading of greater than 0.000 BAC and less
than 0.020 BAC, the acceptance criterion is: not more than one such result.
The AL-5000 device had no false positives in this trial.
e. Analytical specificity:
The DOT Model Specifications for screening devices require testing with
cigarette smoke to assess any possible interference.
The manufacturer’s labeling does not instruct the user to wait a specific time
after consuming cigarettes before taking a reading, therefore the initial reading
was taken within 1 minute as specified in the DOT model specifications. The
subject was then asked to smoke another inhalation and repeat the test to
produce a total of five trials. The acceptance criterion for this trial is: no
positive results. The AL-5000 device had no positive results.
f. Temperature:
The DOT Model Specifications require testing at 10ºC and 40ºC to assess any
possible effects of temperature.
At 10 ºC, 20 trials are required at 0.008 BAC and 20 trials are required at
0.032 BAC. Acceptance criteria are: not more than one positive result at 0.008
BAC, and not more than one non-positive result at 0.032 BAC. The AL-5000
device had no positive results at 0.008 BAC and no non-positive results at
0.032 BAC.
At 40 ºC, the requirements are identical. Again the AL-5000 device had no
positive results at 0.008 BAC and no non-positive results at 0.032 BAC.
g. Vibration:
The DOT Model Specifications requires vibration testing to assess any
possible vibrational effects.
Twenty trials are required at 0.008 BAC and 0.032 BAC. Acceptance criteria
are: not more than one positive result at 0.008 BAC, and not more than one
non-positive result at 0.032 BAC. The AL-5000 device had no positive results
at 0.008 BAC and no non-positive results at 0.032 BAC.

h. Assay Cutoff
For the purposes of performance testing, a BAC cutoff of 0.020 was used to
distinguish positive from negative samples. The sponsor states in the labeling
that consumption of alcohol in any amount may impair the ability to operate a
motor vehicle.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The accuracy of this device is addressed in the precision section above. In
addition, the sponsor conducted a consumer study comparing the device to the
predicate. The purpose of the study was to determine if consumers could
correctly use and interpret the device using only the supplied User’s Manual,
and to compare the results to the predicate device. The field test was
performed involving 117 people, and the volunteers ranged in age from 20 to
60+ years of age. Each participant took their breath alcohol reading and
recorded the result. Afterward, each participants were administered a breath
alcohol test using the predicate device. The breath alcohol concentrations
ranged from a BAC of 0.000 to 0.31. Linear regression of the data shows a
slope of 0.997, y-intercept of 0 and a correlation coefficient of 0.98.
Also, the participants answered a questionnaire to determine how well they
understood the user manual and how to use the device. The results are
presented below:
