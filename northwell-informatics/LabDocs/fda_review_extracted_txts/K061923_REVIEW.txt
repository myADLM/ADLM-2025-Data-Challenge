c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The assigned values of the Enzyme 1 Calibrator were verified
on a Dimension® Vista™ System calibrated with an approved Master Pool.
Master Pool values were assigned on multiple Dimenison® clinical chemistry
instruments. According to the sponsor the traceability of the assigned values
of the Enzyme 1 Calibrator was standardized to the below table of assigned
values.

Stability: The target shelf life for the Dimension Vista™ Chemistry I
Calibrator is 12 months. The sponsor’s shelf life was determined by
comparing results of the product stored at 4°C with control stored at -20°C.
Shelf-life stability (expiration) dating assignment at commercialization
reflects the real-time data on file at Dade Behring, Inc.
A vial punctured by the instrument and stored on board has a stability claim of
one day.
An open vial not on instrument, but recapped and stored is a refrigerator has a
stability claim of 30 days.
