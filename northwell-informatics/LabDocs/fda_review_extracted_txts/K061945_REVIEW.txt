3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
VITEK® 2 Yeast panels are designed for testing Candida species. The panels
contain concentrations of antifungal drugs equivalent by efficacy to standard method
concentrations in µg/mL dried with microbiological media. Isolated colonies of
Candida species are diluted to a standardized concentration in 0.45% saline before
being used to rehydrate the antifungal drug concentration in the card. The VITEK® 2
automatically fills, seals and places the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK®
2 monitors the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time (up to 36
hours). The computer determines when a well demonstrates growth based on
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. At the completion of the
incubation cycle a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the
interpretive category result for each antifungal contained on the card. The final
concentration in the card of the inoculum is ~ 106 CFU/ml. A final dilution of
organism can be performed using a manual procedure or an automated feature but
there are no manual readings possible.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was conducted at three sites on ten yeast isolates with testing
performed over three days in triplicate. The testing was performed using both
the manual dilution mode and the automated dilution mode. The
reproducibility was >95% with +/- one dilution observations.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality Control testing was performed on each day of clinical testing on the
quality control ATCC strains recommended in the CLSI standard M27. The
following table represents the frequency of the results in both the reference
method and the Vitek® 2 Yeast Fluconazole cards and the acceptable range.
Quality control was performed on the Vitek®2 on the Vitek®2 Yeast
Fluconazole card using both the manual dilution and the automated method.

At least one Quality control organism was in control in the reference on all
days. Quality Control results for the Vitek®2 using either inoculation
dilution method demonstrated that the Vitek®2 system could produce the
expected quality control results.
The DensiCheck instrument was used to standardize the inoculum with
instrument standardization weekly with acceptable performance at all times.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance was established on the VITEK® 2 System for Candida spp. at
multiple clinical laboratories. The CLSI reference method as described in the
CLSI document M27 “Method for Broth Dilution Antifungal Susceptibility
Testing of Yeasts” was compared to the Vitek® 2 result. A total of 346 isolates
of Candida species were tested on the Vitek®2 using the automated inoculation
dilution feature. For the evaluation, the 46 C. krusei tested were not used in the
analysis since these are reported as resistant to fluconazole regardless of the MIC
achieved. An additional 75 challenge isolates of Candida spp. were tested using
the automated inoculum dilution method and added to the data for analysis.
EA was calculated when the results for the reference method and the Vitek® 2
were within +/- two doubling dilutions of the antifungal drug. Purity checks were
performed daily during the clinical study. Clinical results on the Vitek®2 were
read when the instrument determined the positive control was growing
sufficiently to obtain a reading. In this study this occurred as early as 10 hours
and a maximum time of 31 hours with an average of 13.5 hours. The following
table presents the performance of the Vitek®2 as compared to the reference
method when read after both 24 hour and 48 hour readings.

An evaluation was also performed using the +/- one dilution for EA to the
reference method. The CA would be the dame for either method of comparison.
The 24 hour reading of the reference method agreed very well with the Vitek®2
results with either the +/- 1 dilution or the +/- 2 dilutions evaluation. There was
only one additional vmj with the 48 reference readings but as shown the number
of minor errors did increase.
The challenge data was also performed using the manual method of inoculation
preparation. The comparison between the data generated with the challenge,
reproducibility and quality control using both inoculation methods was very good
with no apparent trending. The no growth rate was < 5%.
