510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
k061970
B. Purpose for Submission:
Modification to the manufacturer’s existing device including changes to a strictly mono-
biotinylated monoclonal antibody (the antibody itself remains unchanged), deletion of an
application for the Elecsys 1010 analyzer and modifications to specifications for linearity,
intra-assay and inter-assay precision.
C. Measurand:
Quantitative determination of IgE in human serum and plasma
D. Type of Test:
Immunoassay
E. Applicant:
Roche Diagnostics.
F. Proprietary and Established Names:
Elecsys IgE II immunoassay
G. Regulatory Information:
1. Regulation section:
21 CFR 866.5510, Immunoglobulins A, G, M, D and E Immunological test system
2. Classification:
Class II
3. Product code:
JHR, Radioimmunoassay, Immunoglobulins (D, E)
4. Panel:
Immunology (82)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Immunoassay for the in vitro quantitative determination of immunoglobulin E in human
serum and plasma. Determination of total IgE is useful as an aid in the diagnosis of
allergic diseases.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
I. Device Description:
The Elecsys IgE II immunoassay is a two step sandwich immunoassay with streptavidin
microparticles and electrochemiluminescence detection. Results are determined using a
calibration curve that is generated specifically on each instrument by a 2 point calibration and
a master curve provided with the reagent bar code.
