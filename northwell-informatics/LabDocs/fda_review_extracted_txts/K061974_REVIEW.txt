Intelligent Quality Management (iQM) is used as the quality control and assessment
system for the GEM Premier 4000 system. iQM is an active quality process control
program designed to provide continuous monitoring of the analytical process with real-
time, automatic error detection, automatic correction of the system and automatic
documentation of all corrective actions, replacing the use of traditional external quality
controls.
As part of this program, GEM CVP 1 and 2 (Calibration Valuation Product) with CO-Ox
and GEM CVP 3 and 4 Hematocrit are external solutions intended to complete the
calibration process and final accuracy assessment of the iQM cartridge calibration after
initial warm-up. The reported values for the four levels of GEM CVP (two levels for pH,
blood gases, electrolytes, metabolites and CO-Oximetry; two levels for hematocrit) must
meet specifications before the iQM cartridge can be used for patient sample
measurements. Once the cartridge calibration is verified, the internal iQM program
monitors the status of the system during the cartridge use life.

Cl- and Ca++, amperometric electrodes to measure pO2, glucose and lactate concentrations
and blood conductivity to measure hematocrit. CO-Oximetry measurements involve
chemically lysing the whole blood sample and then utilizing a broad spectrum spectrometer
to evaluate the sample at a variety of wavelengths.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To verify the performance of the GEM Premier 4000, whole blood precision testing
was performed in-house on 6 to 12 different GEM Premier 4000 instruments,
depending on the analyte. Six levels for pH, blood gases, potassium, glucose and
lactate, 7 levels for sodium, calcium and chloride, 8 levels for hematocrit and 5 to 9
levels for CO-Oximetry were evaluated using whole blood from healthy adult
volunteers.
Samples were altered with various levels of analytes (salts, gases, or plasma) to span
the claimed measuring range and tested in 3 replicates per run on each instrument.
All parameters were tested once in week two of the cartridge use life. The data was
used to show within run standard deviations and %CV pooled. Results are
summarized below.

To verify the performance of the GEM CVP, precision data were generated using
GEM CVP 1 and 2 (Calibration Valuation Product) with CO-Ox (two levels for pH,
blood gases, electrolytes, metabolites and CO-Oximetry) and GEM CVP 3 and 4
Hematocrit (two levels). The control levels were assayed twice a day in duplicate
over 10 days for a total of 20 runs on 3 different GEM Premier 4000 instruments
(N=120). The day-to-day and total %CV (or SD) were calculated across all 3
instruments. SD is used for pH and the CO-Oximeter fractions. Results are
summarized below.

A separate study was performed to show that the instrument is linear with regards to
the lowest detectable limit of glucose indicated in the functional sensitivity study
(below). Five levels of glucose (1.3, 6, 18, 54, and 94 mg/dL) were used with 3
replicates per level. Samples were tested on 9 GEM 4000 instruments and were
compared to tests run on 3 GEM 3000 instruments resulting in 27 samples per level
of glucose. The linearity was summarized as Observed = 1.0552(Expected) +1.2853;
r2 = 0.9998.

d. Detection limit:
Functional sensitivity was determined for all measured analytes on the GEM Premier
4000. Functional sensitivity was defined by the sponsor as the lowest concentration
of an analyte at which quantitative information is available and where a coefficient of
variation (CV) of ≤ 20% (within run) is obtained. In this test, a run was performed
consisting of 10 replicates of the same whole blood sample on at least 4 different
GEM Premier 4000 instruments. Pooled within run SD and % CV were calculated.
Functional sensitivity was used to determine the low limit of the reportable range for
all measured analytes on the GEM Premier 4000. The proposed low limit of the
reportable range is above the observed functional sensitivity requirement for all
analytes.

2 The GEM Premier 4000 with iQM (Intelligent Quality Management) employs failure
pattern recognition checks. These checks include the presence of positively charged
lipophilic compounds (e.g., benzalkonium) and negatively charged lipophilic compounds
(e.g., thiopental).
3 CO-Oximetry interference is detected and flagged by failure pattern recognition checks.
The following substances showed noticeable interference with the glucose channel on the GEM
Premier 4000, causing falsely lowered results.

b. Matrix comparison:
A study was performed to demonstrate equivalence between the normal, capillary and
micro sampling modes on the GEM Premier 4000. Each day, two whole blood
sample preparations (Level 1 and Level 2) were tested in duplicate twice per day for
10 days on each of three different GEM Premier 4000 for a total of 40 samples per
instrument and a pooled total of N=120 per level.
To compensate for day-to-day sample preparation variation, the evaluation utilized
normalization techniques. The following reference instruments were run to monitor
any sample degradation thus allowing for these normalization techniques:

O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The instrument has three modes of operation: normal, capillary, and micro mode. The
system’s core operation module (the PAK cartridge) can also be purchased in different
configurations of analyte measuring capabilities (e.g. with or without electrolyte testing).
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Sample identification is performed through an interface which instructs the device which
sample types are to be detected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The sponsor indicates in the operator’s manual that it is recommended that the samples be
well mixed prior to introduction into the analyzer. In the operator’s manual, topics

covered by training videos on the system are identified with icons. The videos cover
topics such as sample handling, patient sampling, and inserting and removing the
cartridge. The sponsor also cautions the user that only sodium or lithium anticoagulant
be used with samples.
5. Calibration:
As part of this program, GEM CVP (Calibration Valuation Product) with CO-Ox and
GEM CVP Hematocrit are external solutions intended to complete the calibration process
and final accuracy assessment of the iQM cartridge calibration after initial warm-up. The
reported values for the four levels of GEM CVP (two levels for pH, blood gases,
electrolytes, metabolites and CO-Oximetry; two levels for hematocrit) must meet
specifications before the iQM cartridge can be used for patient sample measurements.
Once the cartridge calibration is verified, the internal iQM program monitors the status of
the system during the cartridge use life. The GEM CVP solutions are pre-tonometered
and contain known quantities of the analytes and dyes tested using CLSI and NIST
traceable reference standards.
6. Quality Control:
The sensors of the instrument are calibrated and monitored with four Process Control
Solutions A, B, C and D. These solutions are pre-tonometered and contain known
quantities of the analytes and dyes tested using NIST traceable reference standards. The
solutions are sealed in gas impermeable bags with no headspace.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
