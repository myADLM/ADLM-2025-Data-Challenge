In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Intended for Professional Use (November 30, 2004)
“Guidance Document for the Submission of Tumor Associated Antigens Premarket
Notifications, [510(k)], to FDA to Guide Manufacturers
L. Test Principle:
Epithelial cells are immunomagnetically labeled by targeting the Epithelial Cell
Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) antigen. Anti-EpCAM monoclonal antibodies
conjugated to ferrofluid particles are colloidal and, when mixed with a sample
containing the target epithelial cells, bind to the EpCAM antigen associated with the
epithelial cells. After immunomagnetic selection of epithelial cells from 7.5 mL of
blood, fluorescent reagents are added at this time to discriminate between the
immunomagnetically selected cells. Anti-Cytokeratin – Phycoerythrin (CK-PE)
stains the intracellular cytoskeleton cytokeratin proteins expressed in cells of
epithelial origin, anti-CD45-Allophycocyan (CD45-APC) stains leukocytes and DAPI
stains DNA present in the cell nucleus.
The processed reagent/sample mixture is dispensed by the CellTracks® AutoPrep
System into a cartridge that is inserted into a MagNest® cell presentation device. The
strong magnetic field of the MagNest® device causes the magnetically-labeled target
cells to move to the surface of the cartridge. The cartridge is then placed on the
CellTracks® Analyzer II for data acquisition and analysis. The CellTracks Analyzer
II scans the entire surface of the cartridge with a series of fluorescence filters that are
defined for a given assay and acquires images of PE, APC and DAPI fluorescence
staining of the entire viewing surface.
After data acquisition is completed, the images are analyzed for any event where
cytokeratin-PE and DAPI are within a specified space in the cartridge, i.e. indicating
the possible presence of a cell with a nucleus that expresses cytokeratin. Images from
each fluorescent color as well as a composite image of the cytokeratin staining
(green) and the nuclear staining (purple) are presented to the user in a gallery for final
cell classification. A cell is classified as a tumor cell when it its EpCAM+ (i.e., it is
captured), CK+, DAPI+ and CD45-. A check mark placed by the operator next to the
composite images classifies the event as a Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) and the
software tallies all the checked boxes to obtain the CTC count.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i. System Reproducibility with CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell
Control
Three separate CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell Control samples were
prepared and processed each day for over 30 days, per the long run method of
NCCLS guideline EP5-A2. Each single-use sample bottle contains a low and a
4

high concentration of cells from a fixed cell line that have been pre-stained with
two different fluorochromes. Summary statistics for the high and low control cells
is presented below.

ii. System Reproducibility with Patient Samples
A total of 163 duplicate samples were collected from 47 patients over the course
of the clinical study. These samples were processed at multiple sites to determine
the reproducibility of CTC measurements. The regression equation for the
comparison of these 163 duplicate samples was y=0.98x + 0.67, R2=0.99. Table
2 shows the summary of the data for replicates where the average of the two CTC
results was <5 compared to those where the average (avg.) was ≥5.

Mean CTC Count of Duplicates 0.7 210
Avg. Duplicate Standard Deviation 0.5 12

b. Accuracy/Recovery:
Blood samples from a single healthy donor were pooled and five of six 7.5
mL aliquots were spiked with 5, 20, 81, 325 and 1300 cultured breast cancer
cells (SK-Br-3). The sixth tube was unspiked pooled blood and served as a
zero point. These samples were processed on the CellTracks® AutoPrep
System with the CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell Kit and CTC counts
were determined on the CellTracks® Analyzer II. The experiment was
repeated for four additional donors. The observed cell counts were plotted
against the results of the expected cell count. The results are summarized in
Table 3.

81	85	80 to 136%
20	22	95 to 140%

--- Page 6 ---
To determine the overall, or least squares fit, for the comparison of the
observed and expected cell counts across all the data, linear regression
analysis was performed. The regression equation for these 30 samples was
y=0.93x + 3.87, R2=0.999. The results of this study indicate that on average
over the tested CTC range the recovery, as derived from regression analysis, is
93%.
Given the linear response of the tumor cell counts, one would expect the slope
of the observed versus expected plot to be 1.0. However, the slope was 0.93.
This is because the CellTracks® AutoPrep System with CellSearch™ CTC Kit
involves the capture and fluorescent labeling of cells followed by their
detection and enumeration by the CellTracks® Analyzer II. The loss of cells
could therefore be attributed to one of the following possibilities; 1) the
recovery of only 93% of the tumor cells spiked into 7.5mL of blood by the
CellTracks® AutoPrep System, 2) the detection of only 93% of the tumor cells
present in the sample chamber by the CellTracks® Analyzer II or 3) a
combination of both of these sources of error.
Linearity/assay reportable range:
Another way to examine the previous data is to analyze it as a dilution series
to evaluate test linearity. The confounding variable of percent recovery was
removed by using the observed value of the original sample divided by the
dilution factors to determine the expected values for the dilution series for
each patient sample. Regression of all of these numbers of observed tumor
cells versus the numbers of expected tumor cells yielded a slope of 1.007, an
intercept of 3.0, an r2 = 0.99 and r = 0.995. Therefore, once the percent
recovery (cell loss) was factored out of the CTC values of each of the original
samples, this analysis of the data demonstrated that the detection of CTC was
linear over the reportable range of 0 to 1238 tumor cells.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
No recognized reference material or method.
d. Detection limit:
One CTC per 7.5 mL can be detected by the CellTracks® Analyzer II resulting
in a limit of detection of 1 CTC in a cartridge. Linear regression shows that
on average, 93% of CTC present in a 7.5 mL blood sample are recovered
using the CellTracks® AutoPrep System (see Recovery section). The loss of
approximately 7% of the CTC in the sample is not sufficient to reduce the
limit of detection of 1 CTC.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering Substances:
SK-BR-3 cells spiked into blood samples were exposed to potential interfering
substances and compared to untreated controls. Toxic levels (5 times
therapeutic index) of the following cancer drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and
other exogenous substances were tested: cyclophosphamide, Mitomycin C®,
Procrit®, biotin, 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate, tamoxifen citrate, paclitaxel,
6

--- Page 7 ---
Arimidex®, acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, dextromethorphan,
Aredia®, Human Anti-Mouse Antibody (HAMA) type 1, HAMA type 2,
Herceptin®, and ibuprofen. No significant differences in SK-BR-3 cell
numbers were detected, indicating that these substances do not interfere with
the CellSearch™ kit.
Samples spiked with toxic levels of doxorubicin resulted in aberrant staining
of leukocytes as cytokeratin and CD45 dual positive cells, due to the
doxorubicin being a fluorescent compound that is incorporated into nucleated
cells. If seen, the staining pattern of all cells being CD45 positive and
cytokeratin positive is obvious and easily identified by the operator as a
known interference staining profile. If blood is drawn after the recommended
7-day washout period, following doxorubicin infusion, this interference is
unlikely to be observed in clinical practice given controlled therapeutic levels
and rapid drug clearance.
Potential interference from lipemia was studied by adding Intralipid to
samples to a concentration of 2.6%, which corresponds to greater than 1000
mg/dL triglyceride. Samples were lysed to simulate total hemolysis.
Bilirubin at 7.4 mg/dL, HAMA 1/HAMA 2 and hematocrit from 18-60% were
studied. Lipemia, hemolysis, icterus and a broad range of hematocrit values
do not interfere with the CellSearch™ test. HAMA 1 and HAMA 2 also do
not interfere, indicating that individuals receiving mouse Ig by parenteral
routes can be tested successfully with the CellSearchTM test.
f. Assay cut-off:
Results are reported as the number of CTC/7.5 mL of blood. A CTC count of
5 or more per 7.5 mL of blood is predictive of shorter progression free
survival and overall survival. This cut-off was established in the 510(k) of the
previous version of this assay (k031588).
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Direct comparison to the UroVysion Bladder cancer Recurrence Kit is not
feasible since it is different measurands in a different intended population. As
for the Vitros CA15-3 assay, the measurand is a serum tumor marker and not
for circulating tumor cells.
b. Matrix comparison:
Since there is only one matrix for this test, i.e. whole blood, no matrix
comparison studies were performed.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
USE OF CTC TO MONITOR CLINICAL STATUS

--- Page 8 ---
Relationship between survival, CTCs, and disease assessment by imaging
Radiological imaging is one of the primary means of determining disease status and
response to therapy in metastatic breast cancer patients. To establish the relationship of
CTCs, measured at two different time points, to clinical status as determined by imaging,
CTCs and imaging results were compared 1) to the true clinical endpoint overall survival
and 2) to each other.
CTC
Previous data has shown that patients with ≥5 CTCs / 7.5mL of blood at any succeeding
follow-up visit after the initiation of therapy had a higher likelihood of progressive
disease and decreased overall survival compared to patients with <5 CTCs / 7.5mL of
blood.
Imaging
All imaging sites were in compliance with Digital Imaging and Communications in
Medicine (DICOM) standards. Using standardized digital images, two expert radiologists
(readers), working individually and blinded to clinical information, classified each
follow-up disease assessment (total of 231 imaging studies) from 138 patients with
measurable disease as indeterminate (I), stable disease (S), partial response (PR), or
progressive disease (PD) according to World Health Organization (WHO) bi-dimensional
criteria. Measurable disease was defined as the presence of at least one lesion ≥2cm in its
longest dimension. Readers identified up to eight lesions per patient per time point by
describing the longest dimension of the lesion and the longest perpendicular dimension.
These two dimensions were multiplied and the “cross product” was reported. Summed
measurements for the cross-products were calculated, and percent change from the
previous time point was determined. Although all patients had measurable disease, non-
measurable lesions (still detectable by radiology) were included in the determination of
patient status as described in the WHO guidelines. Progressive disease was defined as a
>25% increase in the sum of all lesions or appearance of a new measurable or non-
measurable lesion. Partial response was defined as a decrease in the sum of all lesions of
≥50% and no new lesions.
• Radiology interpretations from the two expert radiologists were classified as
followed:
- S and PR were considered to both reflect non-progressive disease (NPD)
- PD was considered to reflect progressive disease
- In situations where one of the radiologists rendered a classification of
Indeterminate (I) but the other radiologist rendered a classification of S, PR or
PD, the classification of the latter radiologist was used for comparison to CTCs
(n=11)
- When both radiologists rendered a classification of Indeterminate (I), then the
data was not used in the comparison to CTCs (n=3)
- A third independent radiologist adjudicated disagreements between the two
primary readers regarding PD and NPD (n=27)
8

--- Page 9 ---
- In situations where the third independent radiologist rendered a classification of
Indeterminate (I), the data was not used in the comparison to CTCs (n=2)
- In serial imaging studies, radiology results that were less than one month from a
previous tabulated observation were not used (n=1).
• The CTC results obtained within ± one month of the imaging study were classified
as <5 CTC and ≥5 CTC. If more than one CTC value was obtained within ± one
month of the imaging study, the CTC result obtained closest to the date of the
imaging study was used.
Concordances between CTC and Radiological Monitoring
Imaging studies are a major component of the current standard of care for determining
disease progression and response to treatment in the metastatic breast cancer setting. To
support the effectiveness of CTCs in making these clinical assessments, two-by-two
tabulations of concordant and discordant observations between CTCs and radiological
imaging were constructed using the previously described criteria.
Using only the 1st follow-up imaging study, the radiological response at this visit was
compared with the CTC results obtained within + one month of this imaging study. A
total of 134 of the 138 patients (97%) had CTC results that met this criterion. The result
of this “patient-wise” comparison between CTCs and imaging is shown in Table 4.

Using all of the follow-up imaging studies performed after the initiation of therapy on the
138 patients that rendered useable radiological response results (n=225), these results
were then compared to CTC results obtained within ± one month of the imaging study. A
total of 219 of the 225 (97%) imaging studies had CTC results meeting this criterion.
The result of this “observation-wise” comparison between CTCs and imaging is shown in
Table 5.

In serial observations, only a minority of the transitions for imaging results between
non-progressive disease and progressive disease coincided with a matching transition of
CTC counts between <5 and ≥5 CTCs/7.5 mL.
Because the prognostic value of the CTC results at an earlier time-point were equivalent
to that of the CTC results at the time of imaging, a patient-wise comparison using results
from only the 1st follow-up imaging study, performed approximately 9 weeks after the
initiation of therapy, and the CTC results obtained at the 1st follow-up, performed
approximately 4 weeks after initiation of therapy, was constructed. All 138 patients had
CTC results meeting this criterion. The result of this “patient-wise” comparison between
CTCs at an earlier time point and imaging is shown in Table 6.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Results are reported as the number of CTC / 7.5 mL of blood. A CTC count of 5
or more per 7.5 mL of blood is predictive of shorter progression free survival and
overall survival. This cut-off was established in the 510(k) of the previous
version of this assay (k031588).
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The EXPECTED VALUES were determined with a previous version of this test ,
as presented in k031588. The present version of the test was demonstrated to be
substantially equivalent to that in k031588 in k050245.
Healthy volunteers, non-malignant breast disease, non-malignant other disease
Single point CTC analyses were performed on control groups of 145 healthy
volunteers, 101 women with non-malignant breast disease, and 99 women with
other non-malignant diseases. Epithelial cells are not expected to be present in
the peripheral blood of healthy individuals. Of the 345 total samples from healthy
volunteers and women with non-malignant disease, only one subject had more
than 5 CTC/7.5 mL. The results are presented in Table 7.
