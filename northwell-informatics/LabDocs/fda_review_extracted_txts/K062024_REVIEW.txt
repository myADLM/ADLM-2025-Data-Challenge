SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
ODE Review Memorandum (Decision Making Document is Attached)
To: THE FILE RE: DOCUMENT NUMBER k062024
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own Class
II, Class III or Class I devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable :
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device.
k990251 – Dimension Digitoxin Flex reagent cartridge
k946153 – Dimension Digoxin Flex reagent cartridge
k962819 - Dimension Gentamicin Flex reagent cartridge
k032564 – Dimension N-acetylprocainamide Flex reagent cartridge
k911056 – Dimension Phenytoin Flex reagent cartridge
k862955 – Dimension Theophylline Flex reagent cartridge
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in
its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for
use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or promotional materials (labeling changes
are permitted as long as they do not affect the intended use).
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including clearly labeled diagrams, engineering
drawings, photographs, user’s and/or service manuals in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the
FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.
This change was
for repackaging existing reagents.
Comparison Information (similarities and differences) to applicant’s legally marketed predicate
device including, labeling, intended use, sample type, analytes, detection methods and the number of
tests per reagent pack. The Dimension Vista supports more tests per pack than the Dimension
platform. This was accomplished by decreasing the reagent and sample volumes.
4. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the
device and its components, and the results of the analysis.
The sponsor conducted a Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FEMA); this analysis did not identify
any risks. An internal review identified the loss of precision due to a decrease in reagent volume
and pipetting errors as the primary risks associated with this platform migration.
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities required,
including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied
A comparison of the new device and predicate labeling indicates the reduction in reagent volume
is proportionate to the reduction in sample volume. The final concentration of sample/reagent ratio
in the test milieu is the same for the both devices.
c) A declaration of conformity with design controls. The declaration of conformity should include:
i) A statement signed by the individual responsible, that, as required by the risk analysis, all
verification and validation activities were performed by the designated individual(s) and the
results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance criteria were met, and
ii) A statement signed by the individual responsible, that the manufacturing facility is in
conformance with design control procedure requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and
the records are available for review.
5. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary or Statement and the Indications for
Use Enclosure (and Class III Summary for Class III devices).
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use
for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular
modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices
demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the

design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the
device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
