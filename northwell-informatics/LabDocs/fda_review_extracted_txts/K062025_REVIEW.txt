L. Test Principle:
The AspirinWorks® Test Kit measures urinary 11 dhTxB and is performed as a
2
competitive ELISA. Diluted samples (Reference Solution, controls and patient
urine), purified 11dhTxB conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (AP), and purified
2
mouse monoclonal antibody directed to 11dhTxB are combined and incubated in
2
microwells coated with a polyclonal anti-mouse antibody. Incubation allows the
endogenous 11dhTxB present in the samples to compete with the purified AP-
2
conjugated 11dhTxB for binding to the mouse monoclonal anti11dhTxB antibody.
2 2
The monoclonal antibody then binds to the polyclonal anti-mouse antibody coated on
the microtiter plate. The complex formed on the plate is composed of monoclonal
antibody and endogenous or AP-conjugated 11dhTxB . After removal of unbound
2
complexes by washing, the bound AP-11dhTxB conjugate is assayed by the addition
2
of para-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) chromogenic substrate. The intensity of color
development in the wells is inversely proportional to the sample urine concentration
of 11dhTxB , and is read at 405 nm. Results (pg/mL) are calculated against a
2
reference curve prepared from the Reference Solution provided in the kit. Final
results are reported as pg 11dhTxB per mg creatinine to normalize results for urine
2
concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The AspirinWorks Test Kit was evaluated for repeatability and within-laboratory
precision. Three urine samples were run on 24 wells per plate over three plates per
lot, repeated on three lots for a total of 216 measurements per urine sample. A test
outcome is defined as the average of two measurements, so the study design results in
108 test measurements (12 per plate over three plates per lot run on three lots of
plates) on which to base the precision calculations shown in the table below.

Repeatability and within-laboratory precision for the AspirinWorks Test Kit is
acceptable for each of the three pilot lots according to the Product Specifications set
by Corgenix (all CV% less than 20%).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was performed following the CLSI EP-6 guideline. A low and high
value urine sample were diluted together and the samples were run in
quadruplicate on the AspirinWorks Test Kit. Mean values of the range of
dilutions for linearity assessment were 352 – 4475 pg/ml. The detection range
for 11-Dehydro Thromboxane B assay is 300-4000 pg/ml urine.
2
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability testing was performed in real time and tested throughout the shelf life
of the kit. Lot specific components were used for testing. Data was provided
for 11 months real time stability to date. Acceptable ranges for the lot of
urine-based controls were 216-416 pg/ml for Control 1, 598-916 pg/ml for
Control 2, and 1480-2220 pg/ml for Control 3. Values were determined to be
within acceptable ranges.
Room temperature, 4° C, and freeze-thaw stability testing was performed as
follows: five urine samples collected from apparently healthy volunteers.
Aliquots of the samples were then stored either at room temperature or 4° C
for the times specified, or frozen and thawed. The samples were run on the
AspirinWorks Test Kit immediately (time zero) or after the times/freeze-
thaws.
Real time stability testing on samples has also been performed. For these
studies, 37 samples spanning the range of the assay were collected from
apparently healthy volunteers. Aliquots were made and samples were frozen
at -70° C. These samples were then measured for 11dhTxB levels (in pg/ml)
2
quarterly over a period of one year. Results reveal that frozen samples remain
viable for 11dhTxB measurement for up to one year at -70° C. Stability
2
analysis will be monitored for up to two years.
Value assignment of Reference Solution was performed using a panel of 12
urine samples (obtained from three bulk urine samples) with lot specific plates
from the beginning, middle and end of each coating of each of three pilot lots.
Two operators each ran four assays using beginning, middle and end plates of
the coating run. The raw data was transferred into a controlled spreadsheet
and the mean OD, standard deviation, and %CV were calculated for each
sample on each plate. A minimum of six of the eight assays must pass all
specifications for R2, %CV, control values, assay blank and non-specific
binding according to the kit Product Specifications. The Reference Solution
correction factor was then calculated from this data.

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined to be 151 pg/ml and the Limit of
Detection (LoD) was determined to be 222 pg/ml based on the protocol in
CLSI EP17-A.
To determine the LoB, two urine samples with minimal levels of 11dhTxB
2
were used as blanks and run by 3 operators across 3 plate lots for a total of 72
measurements. The mean of the blank measurements was 91.4 pg/ml with a
pooled standard deviation of 36.1 pg/ml. The Limit of Blank (LoB) was
calculated based upon the blank mean plus the pooled standard deviation
multiplied by the c of 1.651 to obtain the б and was determined to be 151.0
β β
pg/ml.
To determine the LoD, four urine samples with low levels of 11dhTxB were
2
run by 3 operators across 3 plate lots for a total of 144 measurements. The
pooled mean of the low samples was 204.4 pg/ml with a pooled standard
deviation of 43.1 pg/ml. The Limit of Detection (LoD) was calculated based
upon the LoB plus the pooled standard deviation multiplied by the c of 1.648
β
to obtain the б and was determined to be 222.0 pg/ml.
β
e. Analytical specificity:
Two urines were measured without the presence of any interferent (labeled
“Control”), as well as in the presence of two different concentrations of
interferents (in mg/dL, 1x and 0.5x). The difference in values (“diff”) is the
amount of 11dhTxB (in pg/mL) different from the control value. The percent
2
recovery is in relation to the control value. The raw data was calculated from
duplicate well from each interferent. The spiked samples used for interference
testing include common agents that could be found in the urine of patients
submitting specimens for the AspirinWorks test acetaminophen,
acetylsalicylic acid, ascorbic acid, caffeine, gentisic acid, glucose,
hemoglobin, protein (BSA), and salicylic acid. No significant interference
(≤ 25% difference from control) was caused by physiologically excessive
concentrations of the substances for the levels tested.
Recovery experiments were performed using four different samples
containing a high value of 11dhTxB diluted into the range of the assay. The
2
samples were then serially diluted 1:1.25 in sample diluent for a final panel of
11 – 12 serial dilutions spanning the range of the assay and run on the
AspirinWorks Test Kit pilot lots. The expected concentrations of each
dilution were calculated based on the value obtained for the top dilution of
each sample. Observed values were compared to expected values, and a ratio
of observed/expected values was calculated.

f. Assay cut-off:
11-Dehydro Thromboxane B concentrations were measured and normalized
2
in 405 patients (210 samples from individuals on aspirin and 204 samples
from individuals not on aspirin. Analysis of the frequency distribution of the
samples resulted in a cutoff of 1500 pg 11dhTxB per mg urinary creatinine.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Results for the AspirinWorks Test Kit compared the predicate device at one
study site for detection of aspirin effect in apparently healthy subjects. In
total, 173 urine samples were analyzed both on and off aspirin, and all were
used to compare the AspirinWorks Test Kit to the predicate device. In the
study, 44/49 (89.8%) of the AspirinWorks Baseline 81 mg samples were
above cutoff compared to 47/49 (95.9%) with the predicate. For the Baseline
325 mg samples, 34/38 (89.5%) were above cutoff for the AspirinWorks kit,
while 38/38 (100%) were above cutoff for the predicate. Of those that had
ingested 81 mg aspirin per day, 3/47 (6.4%) of the AspirinWorks samples
were above 1500 pg/mg creatinine, while 1/48 (2.1%) of the samples
measured by the predicate were above the assay cutoff. In patients taking 325
mg ASA per day, 4/37 (10.8%) of the samples were above cutoff for the
AspirinWorks kit, while 3/38 (7.9%) were above cutoff for the predicate.
