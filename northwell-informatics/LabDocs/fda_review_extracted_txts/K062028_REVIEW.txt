L. Test Principle:
The Celera CF GT Assay is based on five major processes: sample preparation, polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), oligonucleotide ligation assay (OLA), detection and electrophoretic
analysis of OLA fragments, data analysis. It uses DNA fragment analysis for determining
the carrier status of a defined panel of CF mutations. Purified gDNA is prepared from whole
blood by standard purification methods. The gDNA is amplified in a multiplex PCR reaction
with 16 pairs of PCR primers and DNA polymerase followed by an OLA). Allele-specific
OLA probes hybridize to the respective normal and become ligated with fluorescent-labeled
common probes upon successful annealing by the ligase enzyme. The OLA probes are
varied in length due to the addition of inert mobility modifiers. The ligated, fluorescent-
labeled DNA fragments are separated on the CEGA-16™ Instrument, by capillary
electrophoresis. Detection is based on size and fluorescent label. The ligation products are
then identified and genotyped by analysis with the GeneMapper® Software v3.5.3.
The CF GT Assay kit also contains Reflex OLA reagents for the detection of the
polythymidine (Poly-T) 5/7/9T variants in IVS-8 of the CFTR gene and for the detection of
the I506V, I507V, and F508C polymorphisms in Exon 10 of the CFTR gene. The CFTR
R117H mutation, along with 5T of the 5/7/9T variant in IVS-8 on the same allele (in cis), has
been shown to be associated with a variable phenotype when associated with another CF
mutation. As a result, reflex testing for the 5T variant with the CF 5/7/9T Reflex OLA assay
is recommended when the R117H mutation is detected in the core assay. The CF Exon 10
Reflex OLA assay is used to verify a homozygous deletion of the F508 or I507 codon and to
exclude a potential false-positive result due to interference by certain non-CF causing
polymorphisms at codons 506, 507, and 508. The CF Exon 10 Reflex OLA assay will
distinguish between a true homozygous delF508 or delI507 from a sample containing one
delF508 or delI507 allele plus the benign polymorphism of I506V, I507V or F508C. The
same software contained on the configuration disk is used to report reflex testing genotyping

information.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A single-blinded study was conducted at three external test sites. Each test site had
one set of instruments, two operators, and three lots of reagents. One lot of reagents
was used each day for three days. Each site also processed the same set of samples.
The samples tested included gDNA obtained from frozen whole blood and gDNA
from commercially available frozen cell line pellets. The expected genotype call for
every unique sample was confirmed by DNA bi-directional sequencing. The 144
reproducibility study samples consisted of three (3) replicates each of forty-eight (48)
unique gDNA samples derived from frozen whole blood (n = 25), and frozen cell line
pellets (n = 23). The frozen whole blood samples contained homozygous normal
alleles for each of the targeted loci within the Core OLA Assay, whereas the frozen
cell line specimens contained either a single heterozygous mutation, a single
homozygous mutation, or compound heterozygous mutations for CF. Each of three
test sites received sufficient aliquots of each test panel member to conduct three
independent assays (3 assays x 144 samples/assay = 432 results per site). Each assay
was performed with a different reagent lot (n = 3) on a different day. There were a
total of 1,296 test results for each mutation (48 samples x 27 replicates). Reflex
testing was performed as indicated per results of the Core OLA Assay and in
accordance with ACMG guidelines.
Reproducibility Results
Statistical analysis of all 1,296 results within the sample set indicates 100%
agreement between the Core OLA Assay and sequencing, with a one-sided 95%
lower confidence limit equal to 99.8%. Based on results of the Core OLA Assay, two
samples required reflex testing. One sample had a homozygous delF508 call by the
Core OLA Assay. Both sequencing and Exon 10 reflex testing for all replicates (n =
9) confirmed the homozygous delF508 call. The Core OLA Assay result for the other
sample contained an R117H mutation, therefore, reflex testing for variants in the
Poly-T tract on IVS-8 (i.e., 5/7/9T) was conducted. Specifically, the 5T and 9T
variant alleles were identified in this sample. Both sequencing and reflex testing
results were in 100% agreement for all calls.
Results of the study indicate that the CF GT Assay has a reproducibility of 100%,
with zero (0) missed calls, as shown in the Reproducibility Table below.

a. Re-injection of same OLA reaction. Represents cases where users chose to reinject individual samples as well as entire or partial plates
(usually based on convenience). In cases where plates were reinjected, initial, correct genotype calls did not change with repeat testing.
b. Results reflect percent agreement with sequencing prior to repeat testing.
c. Repeat from DNA/PCR. Repeat testing was performed due to a poor reaction or PCR failure, GeneMapper quality flags indicating
questionable or invalid data.
d. Reflex testing included. Exon 10: Nine additional calls per site (1 call per sample x 3 replicates x 3 lots). 5/7/9/T: Eighteen additional calls per
site (2 calls per sample x 3 replicates x 3 lots).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The reference method is bi-directional sequencing.
Assay Controls: The assay contains positive and negative controls to assure proper
test results.
d. Detection limit:
The package insert recommends that the concentration of gDNA should be between
5-15 ng/μL. Development studies tested up to 100 ng of input DNA and no off-scale
peaks were ever observed. Artifact peaks have been observed when excessive
amount (≥100 ng) of input DNA is used however the peaks always appear outside the
defined marker bins. These peaks are not labeled, and therefore do not affect the
genotype call.
e. Analytical specificity:
Commonly occurring endogenous substances were tested for their potential to
interfere with the performance of the CF Genotyping Assay in detecting mutations.
Potential interfering substances were added to whole blood prior to sample

preparation process for purified gDNA. Results indicate that these four substances at
the concentrations tested did not interfere with the CF GT Assay: hemoglobin (600 to
820 mg/dL), bilirubin (20 mg/dL), triglycerides (500 mg/dL), and protein (8 g/dL).
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
All genotyping calls made by the CF GT Assay on all samples were compared to
those made by bi-directional dideoxy terminal DNA sequencing. The study was
conducted using 163 unique samples representing archived purified gDNA from
blood (51), frozen whole blood (98), fresh whole blood (6), and commercially
available frozen cell line pellets (8). Most of the samples (65%) contained a single,
heterozygous core mutation. Full segmentation of the sample set is summarized in
the following table:
Table 4. CF GT panel.
Sample Segments Number of Unique Samples
One Core CF Mutation 109
Homozygotes 3 (all delF508)
Heterozygotes 106
Two Core CF Mutations 23
Exon 10 Polymorphisms
6
without Core CF Mutation*
Normal for all targeted loci 25
Total = 163
*Included to assess the assay’s ability to detect the polymorphism when present.
The study requirement was to a minimum of 5 samples per mutation. In order to
achieve the target minimum of 5 samples per mutation, additional independent
aliquots were generated from 38 of the unique samples. Thus, the complete sample
set consisted of 201 samples (i.e., 163 unique + 38 duplicates). An overview of the
mutation, polymorphism, and variant distribution within each of the complete sample
set is provided in Table 5.
Table 6 summarizes the CF GT Assay results from the core OLA assay relative to the
sequencing results. For each sample, analysis by both methods confirmed that normal
alleles were present and detected for all loci excluding the loci that contained the
expected mutations.

*Three samples that contained the delF508 mutation were homozygous mutants. Since these three
samples did not contain any normal/wild type alleles at the F508 locus, the number of sample
replicates with a wild type allele is lower [804 – (3 samples/set x 2 sets/site x 2 sites) = 792].
Analysis of results from the two reflex OLA assays indicated nearly 100%
agreement with sequencing, with the exception of one sample replicate that
produced a 5T/7T/9T genotype call per the 5/7/9T OLA Reflex Assay.
Sequencing indicated that only the 5T and 7T alleles were present. The
results from the two reflex OLA assays are summarized in Table 7:

sequencing).Reflex testing was not performed for these samples per the clinical trial protocol, which included
a reflex testing algorithm based on ACMG recommendations
c. N/A = not applicable
d. The 5/7/9T OLA Reflex Assay generated a 5T/7T/9T call for one replicate of one sample, which did not
match the reference sequencing call (5T/7T).
e. The Exon 10 OLA Reflex Assay is not designed to detect the normal allele F508. In the presence of deletion
mutations, the I506 and I507 normal alleles are not seen by the Exon 10 OLA Reflex Assay in most cases;
thus, Exon 10 results must always be analyzed with results from the Core OLA Assay.
All 201 samples, classified below into one of four genotypic categories, were tested
twice for the presence of 32 mutant alleles, 30 normal alleles, 3 Exon 10
polymorphisms, and 3 Poly-T variants by each of the two independent sites:
• 25: normal DNA with none of the CFTR mutations within the test panel
• 140: contained one mutant allele within the core panel
• 35: contained either two mutant alleles within the core panel or one mutant
allele + one polymorphism/variant
• 1: contained two mutant alleles within the core panel + one variant
The results for the Core OLA Assay were compared to sequencing with respect to the
mutations and normal alleles that the core assay is designed to identify in accordance
with ACMG guidelines. When reflex testing was indicated by the Core OLA Assay,
the results for the polymorphisms or variants identified by the reflex testing were
compared with sequencing. The CF GT Assay uses a testing algorithm based on the
ACMG guidelines; therefore, testing for polymorphisms within Exon 10 and variants
within the Poly-T tract of IVS-8 is only warranted when specific results are observed
in the Core OLA Assay. Percent agreement between the CF GT Assay and
sequencing is summarized in the following table for all 24,954 genotype calls within
the sample set.

a. The 5/7/9T Reflex OLA Assay erroneously identified the 9T variant in one replicate of sample 6043.Sequencing
confirmed that this sample contained a heterozygous 5T variant and the 7T normal allele, which were also
detected by the 5/7/9T Reflex OLA Assay (along with 9T).
b. The one-sided 95% lower confidence limit = 99.98%.
System Failure Rate
A total of 24,954 genotype calls was generated by the CF GT Assay during the
accuracy study, and all but one call matched the sequencing result (failure rate =
0.004%). The single incorrect genotype call was associated with the 5/7/9T Reflex
OLA Assay result from a single replicate of sample 6043. The reflex assay
erroneously indicated the presence of a 9T variant. One 5T and one 7T variant were
also detected; thus, the genotype call was 5T/7T/9T. Sequencing confirmed that the
sample contained a heterozygous 5T variant and the 7T normal allele. All other
replicates of this sample produced the correct 5T/7T result.
Retest Rate
Of the 804 sample replicates tested, a total of 20 (2.5%) required retest due to a poor
reaction or PCR failure, or GeneMapper quality flags that indicated that the sample
should be repeated when data results were considered questionable or invalid. For
samples that did not initially report a genotype result, the correct result was reported
upon repeat testing.
Additionally, injection failures on the genetic analyzer were observed for 53 samples
(6.6%). The injections were repeated using the same sample-specific electrophoretic
mixes that were prepared for the original injection. Therefore, the genotype call was
classified as ‘delayed’ since repeating the assay was not required. In some cases, the
user chose to limit the reinjection to the individual affected samples. In other cases,
all samples within the capillary run or entire plate were reinjected, based on
convenience. Reinjections were usually performed immediately after the previous
run and were always performed within 48 hours of the addition of Hi-Di™
Formamide to the OLA sample. Upon reinjection, valid results were obtained for
each sample. In cases where partial or entire plates were reinjected, the initial,
correct genotype calls did not change upon reinjection. Table 9 summarizes
comparison results before and after retesting.

The CEGA-16™ Instrument computer workstation is supplied with the instrument. Its
minimum configuration consists of the following:
• Dell™ Precision workstation 340 with:
- 2.4 GHz Intel® Pentium® IV processor
- 1 GB of RAM
- Two 120 GB hard drives
- CD-ROM Drive
The Software Configuration:
• Microsoft® Windows® 2000 Professional Operating System, Service Pack 4
• Data Collection v2.0
• GeneMapper® Software v3.5
- One user kit
• CF Configuration Disk v1.0
- GeneMapper® Software v3.5.3 Upgrade File
- CF Analysis Settings and Parameters
There are three default profiles (Administrator, Scientist, and Technician). Changes or
edits are tracked through the Audit Map function and the users are instructed not to
disable this feature. The CF Configuration Disk version 1.0 is provided by Celera and
installed by Abbott Molecular. It consists of a patch to GeneMapper v3.5 which
upgrades this software package to GeneMapper v3.5.3 to incorporate the necessary IVD
labeling changes and includes minor bug fixes. The CF Configuration disk includes the
GeneMapper Software v3.5.3 Upgrade File along with CF Analysis Settings and
Parameters that customize the GeneMapper Software for use with the CF Assay. Data on
the OLA fragments is collected with the Data Collection Software v2.0. Only the
fragment analysis function/capability of the CEGA-16™ Instrument was reviewed.
Sequence analysis software is not used with the CF GT assay and were not reviewed.
The system runs as a stand alone including an attached printer, or can be networked to a
central printer.
Detailed use of the software is described in the Cystic Fibrosis Genotyping Assay
Instrument and Operator’s manuals, provided separately by the manufacturer. The
ligated, fluorescent-labeled DNA fragments are separated on the CEGA-16™ Instrument
by capillary electrophoresis. Detection is based on size, as compared to the fragments
generated from the CFTR Wild Type Control (allelic ladder), and fluorescent label. The
ligation products are then identified and genotyped by analysis with the GeneMapper®
Software v3.5.3 using a combination of an analysis method, panel, and size standard files
selected during creation of the plate record in the Plate Manager window of the Data
Collection software prior to starting a run, based on the assay type to be run (i.e., Core,
5/7/9T Reflex or Exon 10 Reflex panel). Choice of the wrong method or panel for the
assay type will result in no data. The user can re-run samples however if this occurs with
the correct choices. Sample name or identifiers are entered to identify the location of the
samples on the plate. Samples are also identified by sample type (Allelic Ladder,
Negative Control, or Sample).
The Plate Record is linked to the Run Scheduler through either scanning the plate
barcode or through a search function and dropdown list. The user is instructed to review
the run using the Run View feature to verify the run is scheduled correctly. Data analysis
can be performed automatically by enabling the autoanalysis feature using Autoanalysis
16

--- Page 17 ---
Manager. The GeneMapper software must be closed for the Autoanalysis Manager to
function, if not, sample data is stored in a queue until GeneMapper is closed. The user is
warned not to perform data analysis or run other software during a run.
GeneMapper v3.5.3 analysis functions read the output data (.fsa file extension) from the
Data Collection Software. Samples are sized based on size standards added to each
sample during preparation to be analyzed, and overlays intervals (bins) in which peaks
are expected, grey bins are for normal alleles associated with the marker and pink for
mutant alleles, then labels peaks falling within the expected intervals as either normal or
mutant.
GeneMapper® Software v3.5.3 provides information that allows the user to assess the
quality of the data used to conduct the genotype call analysis. GeneMapper v3.5.3
ensures that the data received after Autoanalysis have at least one or two alleles (normal
or mutant) per locus, have been sized correctly produce expected peak heights and
shapes, and have a normal baseline. To evaluate these parameters, GeneMapper v3.5.3
analyzes the data according to CF specific, preset parameters that are defined within the
configuration file. The data quality results are expressed in the form of flags associated
with Process Quality Values (PQVs), which include Genotype Quality (GQ) and Sample
Genotype Quality (SGQ). The software qualifies results using a summary of signal
quality based on all Quality Values as either Good & Acceptable, Compromised (but
potentially usable), and Unacceptable. The CF GT assay does not support the editing of
Quality Values within the analysis software therefore samples associated with a red
Sample Genotype Quality flag (Unacceptable) must be rejected. Results for samples
associated with a yellow SGQ flag (compromised) may be accepted by the user following
manual review of all data, which includes all sample and marker PQVs, as well as
contents of the electropherogram plot(s). Justification for the acceptance and subsequent
release of results with a yellow SGQ flag is required. The software will provide printouts
of the detected genotypes, electropherograms, and quality values.
Results
Every sample must have at least two alleles for each marker and each marker must have
at least one peak in the electropherogram. The following calls are possible based on the
results.
Table 12. Possible calls for a given result.
If the marker is associated Then the allele call is:
with:
No peaks Invalid
One peak in a gray bin Homozygous normal
One peak in a pink bin Homozygous mutant
One peak in a gray bin + one Heterozygous carrier of the mutant allele associated with
peak in a pink bin the pink bin
One peak in each of two pink Heterozygous carrier of the mutant alleles associated with
bins the pink bins
Views
A number of views are available to visual the data. The GeneMapper v3.5.3 can be used
to view the sample data in both raw and analyzed forms. Operators may adjust the size

using the resize pane and/or zoom functions within the GeneMapper software to enhance
viewing of the electropherogram within the display screen. Operators can also control
the number of individual electropherograms displayed on the screen using the pane
function within the toolbar.
Printing
For the CF GT Assay, the Configuration Disk v1.0 includes a file that configures
GeneMapper in a manner that yields a customized results printout. Each printout
contains information for a single sample. The electropherogram section of the printout
depicts three panes for the CF Core OLA assay results, one for each set of dye-labeled
probes within the OLA reaction (FAM-blue, HEX-green and TAMRA-black). The
Genotypes Table within the printout identifies the alleles detected for each marker, as
well as each marker’s PQV information.

5. Calibration:
Prior to use, both a spatial and spectral calibration must be performed on the instrument
as described in the CEGA-16™ Instrument manual. A spatial calibration must be
performed after each time the user installs or replaces a capillary array, temporarily
removes the capillary array from the detection block, or moves the instrument. The
spectral calibration must be performed whenever a new dye set is used on the instrument;
whenever a service engineer realigns/replaces the laser, optics, or CCD camera; if a
decrease in spectral separation (i.e., called pull-up and/or pull-down peaks) is observed;
or whenever an array is changed and one or more capillaries show low signal strength
and/or pull-up peaks.

The CF GT Assay includes two reagents that are used as controls to monitor assay
performance: CFTR Wild Type Control and CF Sample Diluent. Both the CFTR Wild
Type Control and CF Sample Diluent must be processed with each plate for each OLA
probing test procedure (i.e., a plate with Core, 5/7/9T Reflex, and Exon 10 Reflex
samples must have 3 sets of controls).
CFTR Wild Type Control contains normal alleles for all 30 of the targeted loci within
the CFTR gene. It serves as a positive control for both amplification and detection of the
normal CFTR alleles (allelic ladder control).
A No Template Control (NTC) is consisting of the CF Sample Diluent, which is a
buffered solution that does not contain DNA, is used for both the amplification and data
analysis steps. This reagent must be processed with each batch of samples from PCR
through data analysis. The observation of labeled peaks for the No Template Control
may indicate amplicon cross-contamination.
Optional CF Mutation Positive Control is suggested to the users as recommended in
section CF 3.2.3.4.2 of the 2006 ACMG Technical Standards and Guidelines for CFTR
Mutation Testing. This is a user supplied control which can consist of samples that have
CF mutations that are externally sourced (e.g., reference cell lines), developed in-house
(e.g., plasmid), or previously identified patient samples can be used as a mutation
positive control. If such controls are used, identify them as samples and manually verify
that the results are correct.
