CLSI Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Devices Approved Guideline:
EP5-A2; CLSI Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples
Approved Guideline EP9-A2; CLSI Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry
Approved Guideline EP7-A2.
L. Test Principle:
Polystyrene particles coated with an immunocomplex consisting of human-IgG/anti-
human IgG from sheep are aggregated when mixed with samples containing RF.
These aggregates scatter a beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of
the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in the
sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known
concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP5-A2. Four
samples derived from serum pools representing RF concentrations that span
the measuring range, and the PROT2 CON L and H were analyzed in
duplicate, for 20 days, two times per day. The repeatability and within-lab
standard deviations (SD) and percent coefficient of variation (%CV) were
calculated. Repeatability imprecision was <6%, and within-lab imprecision
was <6.2%.

calibrator with high concentration of RF. The calibrator was serially diluted
in 7, two-fold increments (measuring range from 8.36 to 836.86 IU/mL).
Each dilution was tested in replicates of three. Data were analyzed using
linear regression analysis with the following results:
Slope Y-Intercept Correlation n
IU/mL Coefficient
1.040 -2.348 1.0 21
A recovery study using 1st British Standard 64/002 (5 replicates) showed that
% recovery ranged from 96.4 to 98.6% with a mean recovery of 97.9%
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibration material values were referenced to the 1st British Standard 64/002.
d. Detection Limit
Limit of Detection: 10 IU/mL represents the lower limit of the reportable
range of the RF assay.
Analytical sensitivity was determined by assaying analyte-free System Diluent
20 times and determining the mean value plus two SDs: 0.814 IU/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Interference Studies: Interference testing was performed according to
CLSI EP7-A2, to determine the effect of various exogenous substances on
the Dimension Vista™ RF assay. The following exogenous interferents
were tested by spiking into test samples containing two concentrations of
RF (one at the clinical decision point 12-15 IU/mL and one higher), and
compared to a control sample without interferent: bilirubin (conjugated
and unconjugated, 60 mg/dL), hemoglobin (1000 mg/dL), creatinine (30
mg/dL), albumin (6 g/dL), urea (500 mg/dL), cholesterol (500 mg/dL),
uric acid (20 mg/dL). Minimal interference (<8%) was observed.
Interference by triglycerides (native and clarified) was tested on 5 test
samples containing RF concentrations between 12 and 25 IU/mL, and
minimal interference (<7%) was observed. Additionally, 41 potentially
interfering drugs were also assayed and shown to exhibit minimal
interference (<10%).
ii. Cross-reactivity with autoimmune antibodies common to other systemic
autoimmune diseases was not tested.
iii. Antigen Excess: the effect of antigen excess was evaluated using a serum
sample above the assay range. No effect was seen up to 2877 IU/mL.
Samples above this level are reported as exceeding assay range (>600
IU/mL).
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off of 15 IU/mL was determined by measuring 300 normal
blood donors from Europe and taking the mean between the 95th and 97.5th
percentile value.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The Dimension Vista™ RF assay was compared to the ROCHE Tina-Quant

RF II assay on the Hitachi 917 Analyzer by assaying 120 serum samples with
concentrations ranging form 10-520 IU/mL on both systems. Passing Bablock
regression analysis of these results yielded the following statistics:
Comparative Slope Y-Intercept (IU/mL) Correlation n
Method (95%CI) (95%CI) Coefficient
ROCHE Tina-Quant 0.953 -9.71
0.95 120
RF II/Hitachi 917 (0.898 to 1.024) (-16.192 to -6.021)
b. Matrix comparison:
Fourteen matched serum and lithium heparin plasma samples, containing
concentrations of RF spanning the measuring range (10-515 IU/mL), were
assayed and compared. Regression analysis showed no significant bias
between the two matrices and yielded the following information:
% recovery in Li-Hep Slope Y-Intercept Correlation n
plasma vs. serum (95%CI) (IU/mL) Coefficient
Mean = -2.5% 0.98
-0.04 1.00 14
(Range = -9.7% to 2.3%) (0.94-1.01)
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not provided
b. Clinical specificity:
Not provided
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
See Assay cut-off
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Testing of serum from 300 European blood donors resulted in a 95th percentile of
<10 IU/ml and a 97.5th percentile of 19.5 IU/ml. The expected value of the
normal healthy adults is <15 IU/ml.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
