K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The assay principle is ELISA. The wells are coated with cyclic citrullinated
peptides. During the first incubation, specific antibodies in diluted serum, will
bind to the antigen coating. The wells are then washed to remove unbound
antibodies and other components. A conjugate of alkaline phosphatase-labeled
goat antibodies to human IgG binds to the antibodies in the wells in this second
incubation. After a further washing step, detection of specific antibodies is
obtained by incubation with PMP substrate solution followed by the addition of a
stop solution. The amount of bound antibodies correlates to the color intensity
and is measured in terms of absorbance (optical density (OD)). The absorbance is
then calculated against a calibrator curve and the results are given in arbitrary
units.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no recognized standard for quantitatively expressing levels of anti-
CCP antibodies. The new assay is calibrated in arbitrary units based on a
positive patient serum pool.
The recommended stability of 12 months is based on accelerated stability
studies for plates, conjugate, calibrators, controls and substrate. Real time
studies are ongoing.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit of the assay was determined by running the zero calibrator
12 times on three different lots. The detection limit of 0.5 U/mL was
calculated by finding the mean plus two standard deviations.
e. Analytical specificity:

Three low positive samples were spiked to the following concentrations in
diluted serum samples; bilirubin F at 0.188 mg/dL, bilirubin C at 0.2 mg/dL,
hemoglobin at 453 mg/dL, chyle at 0.24 U/dL and rheumatoid factor at 200
IU/mL. The data indicate that the assayed concentrations do not interfere with
the anti-CCP results.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off level was determined by testing sera from 416 RA patients,
531 non-RA disease patients, and 262 healthy controls from adult subjects. A
ROC analysis was performed. The analysis revealed a point with the lowest
possible sum of false positives and false negative samples and the cut-off was
set at 5 U/mL. Using this cut-off, 99.2% of the normal sera tested were
negative, 98.3% of the non-RA disease sera were negative and 76.2% of the
RA patient sera were positive.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 678 frozen, retrospective sera were tested to determine the
agreement between the new assay and the predicate device. The sera included
416 samples from patients with RA and 262 from apparently healthy blood
donors. The study showed the following:
