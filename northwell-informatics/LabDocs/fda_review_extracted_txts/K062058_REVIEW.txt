L. Test Principle:
Once a whole blood sample is applied to the sample chamber of the test strip, glucose
measurement commences. Glucose measurement is based on electrical potential caused by
the reaction of glucose with the reagents contained on the strip’s electrodes. The current
resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured and converted to glucose concentration by
the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
With-in Run Precision:
Human whole blood samples with hematocrit of 35%-50% were collected in tubes
with sodium heparin anticoagulant. Using a 10% aqueous glucose solution, blood
samples were prepared within the following ranges prescribed in ISO 15197 section
7.2.2.2:
30-50 mg/dL (actual value = 41.3 mg/dL)
51-110 mg/dL (actual value = 99.2 mg/dL)
111-150 mg/dL (actual value = 119.5 mg/dL)
151-250 mg/dL (actual value = 200.0 mg/dL)
251-400 mg/dL (actual value = 325.5 mg/dL)
A total of ten blood glucose meters were used to test one test sensor lot with the
above blood samples. One bottle of test sensors was assigned to each instrument at
the start of the study. One operator performed all the testing. Ten tests were
performed with each blood sample on each instrument. Results are summarized
below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To establish the linearity of the Contour system throughout the entire reportable range
of 10 to 600 mg/dL, data from three studies were combined. In one study, blood with
40% hematocrit was adjusted to plasma glucose concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,
and 60 mg/dL and tested with four Contour lots, n=16 per lot. In a second study, 12
Contour lots were tested with blood adjusted to 50, 120, and 300 mg/dL glucose, n =
24 per lot. In a third study, 10 Contour lots were tested with blood adjusted to 43, 62,
127, 331, and 609 mg/dL, n = 20 per lot. Regression analysis (using the
proportionally weighted least-squares model) conducted with the combined lot means
from all three studies (N = 110) yields the following statistics:
N 110
Slope 0.987
Intercept -0.7
r2 0.996
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability is referenced to the NIST SRM 917a (dry D-glucose).
d. Detection limit:
10 mg/dL. This level was determined to be detectable by the linearity study (above)
and by the hematocrit sensitivity study (see Analytical Specificity below).
e. Analytical specificity:
The interference effect of oxidizable substances (acetaminophen, uric acid, ascorbic
acid) were tested at the following levels and were found to meet the sponsors
acceptance criteria that the bias at the following limiting plasma concentrations be

To verify that the Contour system provides accurate results at the lower end of the
reportable range (where actual clinical specimens are rare and clinical trials cannot be
expected to provide extensive data), a dose response study was conducted with blood
at three hematocrit levels (40%, 55%, and 70%) adjusted to plasma glucose
concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mg/dL. Four Contour lots (SN05M26A,
SN06A06C, 6EC3C01 and 6EC3C02) were each tested with eight Contour meters,
two replicates per meter, for a total of 16 replicates per lot per sample. Readings were
compared to YSI plasma glucose. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion was 95% of
results within ±15 mg/dL of the YSI mean which 100% of the samples met.

To test the accuracy of the hematocrit correction algorithm, three lots, n = 20 per lot,
with blood adjusted to hematocrit levels of 0% (pure plasma), 20%, 35%, 45%, 55%,
and 70% at glucose concentrations of 80 and 350 mg/dL were tested. The sponsor’s

In addition to testing compounds that are known to interfere with electrochemical
glucose monitoring systems (above), testing was also conducted with a variety of
common compounds found in medications or food or occurring naturally in the blood.
The following substances were tested and found to either have no effect trend at any
concentration or to have a limiting concentration (interpolated or extrapolated
concentration creating a bias of 15% at either 80 or 300 mg/dL glucose) that was
significantly higher than the upper limit of the therapeutic or reference range.

It was found that the anticoagulant EDTA, especially when occurring at
concentrations higher than normal due to under-filling an EDTA tube, is
electrochemically active enough to produce a significant negative bias. For this
reason, EDTA tubes will be restricted in the Limitations section of the labeling.
To investigate the effect of altitude on the system, three lots of reagent were tested
across eight (8) meters both inside and outside a hypoxic chamber simulating an
altitude of 12,095 feet. A maximum of three (3) repetitions on each meter were
performed (n=24). Time limitations in some cases allowed for only two (2)
repetitions on each meter (n=16). Whole blood samples with plasma glucose values
of 50, 100, and 400 mg/dL were tested in the above manner, at both 40% and 60%
hematocrits. The acceptance criteria defined by the sponsor was <10% difference
between means in the low oxygen chamber and means outside the chamber. No
systematic response to altitude is seen at either Hematocrit level, and percent bias at
all levels was found to be less than 10%. Therefore the system is not significantly
affected by lack of atmospheric oxygen up to 12,000 feet above sea level.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Fingerstick testing was conducted in two four-day studies. Data collected in four
separate studies with contrived blood specimens were also used in order to bring the
distribution of samples into compliance with the protocol:
Distribution of Plasma Glucose Values
Glucose Range (mg/dL) <50 50 - 80 81 - 120 121 - 200 201 - 300 301 - 400 >400
% of Samples 5% 15% 20% 30% 15% 10% 5%
Each specimen was tested with three Contour lots, n = 2 per lot for a total of six
readings per specimen. After filling each bin in the ISO distribution, no additional
specimens falling in that bin were included in the analysis. A total of 105 diabetic
volunteers participated in the two fingerstick studies after giving informed consent,
and of these donors, 74 met the distribution requirements. Since no diabetic subjects
presented with extremely low or high blood glucose concentrations in either of the
two fingerstick studies, readings from contrived samples were used to fill the extreme
bins. Low glucose specimens were obtained from a dose response study designed to
simulate neonatal specimens. In this study, blood was adjusted to glucose
concentrations between 10 and 60 mg/dL. To fill the lowest bin, the five lower levels
(11.4, 20.5, 30.7, 40.6, and 49.8) were used (taking the two replicates generated with
the first meter used with each lot). To help fill the second lowest bin, three samples at
the 60 mg/dL level, each with a different hematocrit (40%, 55%, and 70%) were used.
Data from a second study was used to obtain two samples at 63 mg/dL (two testers),
four samples at 301 mg/dL (two testers, two meters per tester), two samples at 405
mg/dL (two testers), and one sample at 503 mg/dL. Data from a third study was used
to obtain two samples at 51 mg/dL (two meters), two samples at 79 mg/dL (two
meters), and one sample at 201, 301, 404, and 554 mg/dL. A fourth study was used to
obtain one sample at 300 mg/dL.
A total of 13 lots were represented in the studies. The following table summarizes the
distribution of specimens and lots in each study.

Contrived specimens were prepared with heparinized venous blood that was allowed
to glycolyze to produce low glucose levels or that were supplemented with 20%
glucose stock solution to produce high glucose levels. For fingerstick comparison
readings, approximately 200 µL of fingerstick blood was collected into a heparinized
micro-collection tube. To obtain comparison glucose values, all specimens were
centrifuged to separate the plasma from the blood cells, and the plasma portion was
tested on the YSI STAT Plus Glucose Analyzer. Plasma glucose levels ranged from
11 to 554 mg/dL. Hematocrit levels ranged from 26% to 70%. The tables below
include the proportionally weighted regression statistics and the percentage of
readings within several error limits around the YSI plasma glucose comparison values
(±5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/dL for samples < 75 mg/dL, ±5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% for
samples ≥ 75 mg/dL).

within ± 20% for specimens > 75 mg/dL of a laboratory reference method. Results
are summarized in the tables below.
Thirty-two samples were obtained (based on the average of the laboratory analyzer
results) ranging from 10-50 mg/dL. The table below shows that the Contour system’s
accuracy is adequate for samples ranging from 10-50 mg/dL, meeting ISO accuracy

75 mg/dL and within ± 20% for specimens > 75 mg/dL of a laboratory reference
method.
The Contour’s meter bias was compared to the hematocrit level for each blood
specimen. Correlation coefficients were determined using linear regression shown in
the table below.

[Table 1 on page 12]
Neonatal vs. YSI	
glucose range: 27-131 mg/dL	
hematocrit: 27-70%	
N	122
Slope	1.0065
y-intercept	-0.0522
r2	0.8952

Since the sponsor’s neonatal clinical samples did not cover the claimed range of the
meter, contrived samples were used to test the low and high ranges at high levels of
Hematocrit. These studies are fond in the above in the Analytical Specificity section.
Venous Blood
Performance of the system with venous blood specimens was examined at one site by
a medical technologist who measured the glucose in 169 samples. Venous blood
samples were collected into tubes containing heparin. The material assayed in this
study consisted of excess volume that remained after routine laboratory blood work
had been completed. Plasma and whole blood referenced meters and three test strip
lots were used. The glucose concentration in the samples was adjusted, as necessary,
to span the operating range of the system. Results were compared to glucose results
obtained at the site with a laboratory analyzer. Results using linear regression are
summarized below:
Venous Blood vs. YSI
glucose range: 12-609 mg/dL
hematocrit: 15-53%
N 169
Slope 0.8927
y-intercept 3.614
r2 0.9884
The bias of results is within the ISO accuracy limits of ±15 mg/dL or 20% of the
laboratory glucose method. The results are shown below.
Median Differences From The Laboratory Method
Lot <75 mg/dL (n=26) ≥ 75 mg/dL (n=143)
05M26A -2.0 mg/dL -7.4%
05M26B -2.0 mg/dL -8.3%
06A30A -3.0 mg/dL -11.0%
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not Applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor included the following Expected Values for normal glucose levels in their
meter’s user manual:
__________________________________________
Status Range (mg/dL)
Before meals 90-130
2 hours after meals <180
__________________________________________
American Diabetes Association: Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes (Position
Statement). Diabetes Care 29 (Suppl. 1):S10, 2006.
N. Instrument Name:
Ascensia® CONTOUR ® Blood Glucose Monitoring System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.
2. Software:
FDA reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this
line of product types in k023657 and updated functions in this submission.
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, the palm,
or the forearm only. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip
there are no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
Calibration of the meter occurs by insertion of the test strip and the meter’s recognition of
the strip configuration.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor provides a glucose control solution with the test strips. The meter
recognizes the sample as a control solution which prevents control results from being
stored in the internal memory. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on
the test strip vial label and box. The user is referred to the troubleshooting section of the
owner’s manual if control results fall outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
None.
