H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
For in vitro diagnostic use only. VITROS Chemistry Products AMPH Reagent is
used on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems for the semi-quantitative and
qualitative determination of amphetamines (AMPH) in human urine using a cutoff
of either 500, or 1000 ng/mL. Measurements obtained with the VITRO AMPH
method are used in the diagnosis and treatment of amphetamines use or overdose.
The VITRO Chemistry Products AMPH assay is intended for use by professional
laboratory personnel. It provides only a preliminary test result. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used to confirm a result obtained with this
assay. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred
confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
applied to any drug-of-abuse test result, particularly when evaluating a
preliminary positive result.
VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 26 is used to calibrate VITROS 5,1
FS Chemistry Systems for the qualitative and semi-quantitative measurement of
drugs of abuse.
VITROS Chemistry Products FS Calibrator 1 used in conjunction with VITROS
Chemistry Products Calibrator Kits to calibrate VIROS 5,1 FS Chemistry
Systems.
VITROS Chemistry Products DAT Performance Verifiers are assayed controls
used to monitor performance of urine drugs of abuse screening assays on
VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems.

VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems (k031924)
I. Device Description:
The VITROS AMPH Reagent consists of a dual chambered package containing two
liquid ready-to-use reagents used in a two-step reaction.
Reagent 1 consists of murine monoclonal antibodies reactive to d-amphetamine and
d-methamphetamine, NAD, and Glucose-6-phosphate. Reagent 2 consists of d-
amphetamine and d-methamphetamine labeled with glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase.
Calibrator Kit 26 is a standard that is sold separately. It is a one level of aqueous
solution containing d-methamphetamine (AMPH), with a concentration of 2000
ng/mL. The standard is diluted with the FS Calibrator 1 to construct the standard
curve which is used to calculate the concentration of the unknown samples.
Verifiers I, II, III, IV and V are a set of 6 assayed controls (6 vials – 20 mL each) that
are run with the samples to monitor the performance of the assay. They consist of
human urine which drugs of abuse, metabolites of drugs of abuse, organic salt,
surfactants and preservative have been added.

L. Test Principle:
The test is an enzyme immunoassay for use on the Vitro 5,1 FS Chemistry System.
Calibrators ranging in concentration from 0 to 2000 ng/mL are run with the assay.
The Vitros AMPH assay is a homogenous enzyme immunoassay technique used for
the qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of amphetamine in human urine. In the
performance of the Vitros AMPH assay, samples, calibrators and controls are treated
with surfactant (DAT Diluent 2) prior to addition of the reagents. The treated sample
is mixed with Reagent 1 which contains antibodies reactive to d-amphetamine and d-
methamphetamine, glucose-6-phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD+). Subsequently Reagent 2 containing d-amphetamine and d-
methamphetamine, labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6P-DH) is added. Amphetamine in the treated sample and the d-amphetamine and
d-methamphetamine labeled G6PDH compete for the antibody binding sites. Enzyme
activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, so amphetamine concentration in the
sample can be measured in terms of enzyme activity. Enzyme activity converts
NAD+ to NADH resulting in an absorbance change that is measured
spectrophotometrically at 340 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The samples used for testing were the sponsor’s controls, Verifiers I, II, III,
IV and V. The samples were run in duplicate, twice a day for twenty-two days
using two lots and four instruments. The results are presented in the table
below:

1255 27.1 71.6 5.7
An additional study was performed using three quality control materials
targeted at the assay’s cutoff concentrations. The controls were run 20
replicates per day for five days using a single lot of reagent. The results are
presented in the table below:

Qualitative imprecision was assessed by taking samples with target values +
25 % of the cutoff concentration. The samples were run in duplicates one to
two times a day for twenty-two days using one lot number of reagent and one
analyzer. The results are in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity fluids were prepared from two pools of urine with amphetamine
concentrations near the extremes of the calibration range (low pool 0 ng/mL
and high pool 1800 ng/mL. The two pools were mixed to create 19 additional
pools of intermediate concentrations.

Three determinations of each pool and three determinations of Verifiers were
tested with three lots of reagent and one analyzer. A linear regression analysis
was performed by the method of least squares. The plotted curve conforms to
a straight line, supporting the reportable range 100-1450 ng/mL.
Recovery study:
Fourteen admixtures were prepared from two human urine pools and the
concentrations were verified by GC/MS. Results are presented in the table

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
A primary calibrator is prepared through gravimetric addition of USP (U.S.
Pharmacopoeia) d-methamphetamine reference standard into drug free human
urine and the concentration is confirmed by Gas Chromatography/Mass
Spectrometry (GC/MS). Next working calibrators are prepared by diluting the
primary calibrator with drug free human urine matrix. The value assigned to
the working calibrator is verified by GC/MS.
The VITROS DAT Performance Verifiers I,II,III,IV and V are prepared
through the gravimetric addition of Sigma catalog number M8750 to drug free
human urine matrix and the values are assigned by a GC/MS.
Stability Studies:
Real time and accelerated studies have been conducted. Protocols and
acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The

manufacturer claims the following expiration date:
When stored at 2-8 ºC the assay reagent is good until the expiration date.
When stored at <-18 ºC the calibrator is good until the expiration date. Open
stored at 2-8 ºC it is good for < 28 days.
When stored at 2-8 ºC the controls are good until the expiration date. Open
stored at 2-8 ºC they are good for 4 weeks.
d. Detection limit:
Seven human samples at various concentration below the lowest calibrator
(150 ng/mL) were assayed in 10 replicates once a day for 5 days using three
different lot numbers of reagent. A fully nested ANOVA was used to
determine the total variability of each sample and a pooled SD was calculated
for each of the three reagent lots used. The sponsor followed CLSI EP-17A to
calculate the limit of quantitation which is 75 ng/mL for this assay.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking various concentrations of similarly
structured compounds into drug-free calibrator. The quantity of a compound
that produces a value equivalent to the d-methamphetamine (ng/mL) at each
cutoff is listed below:
