Device; Approved Guideline

L. Test Principle:
Creatinine in serum or urine sample is hydrolyzed to creatine, which is then hydrolyzed
to sarcosine and urea. Sarcosine is oxidized to formaldehyde, glycine, and hydrogen
peroxide. Finally, a peroxidise-catalyzed reaction produces a dye that can be measured
by the instrument. The intensity of the dye, when read at 546 nm, is proportional to the
amount of creatinine in the patient sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i.) Precision studies for serum samples were evaluated according to CLSI
EP5-A guideline. For within-run precision and total precision studies, four
serum specimens were tested on the Hitachi 917 twice daily, in duplicates,
over 20 days. The results are presented in the tables below:

ii.) Precision studies for urine samples were evaluated with a modified CLSI
EP10 protocol. For within-run precision, 21 replicates of commercial urine
controls were tested on the Hitachi 917. For total precision, 2 runs of each
commercial urine control were performed consecutively for 5 days. The
samples were diluted ten-fold with 0.9% saline and tested for Creatinine
values. The results are presented in the tables below:

(mg/dL)
SD (mg/dL) 0.79 0.67 1.19
CV (%) 2.64 0.76 0.60
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
i.) Serum samples: Eleven levels of serum sample pools were prepared by
mixing a low sample and a high sample and were then tested on the Hitachi
917 analyzer. Sample pools range from 0.12 to 14 mg/dL. Results showed
the measured value and expected value differed by ≤ 10% error. The studies
supported the sponsor claimed linearity range of 0.14 to 13.51 mg/dL for
serum samples.
ii.) Urine samples: The same procedure as for serum was performed to evaluate
assay linearity with the urine sample matrix. Sample pools ranged from 0 to
148 mg/dL. In addition, a urine linearity study with samples that encompass
the lower end of the linear range of the assay was performed (sample pools
range from 0.14 to 15.3 mg/dL). The studies support the sponsor’s claimed
linearity range of 0.14 to 141 mg/dL for urine samples.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The Diazyme Creatinine Control is traceable to NIST SRM 914a Creatinine
standard reference material. The value was assigned by performing multiple

determinations using the Hitachi 917 analyzer and the Diazyme Creatinine
Liquid Reagents Assay.
Stability
The long term (shelf life) stability of the Diazyme Creatinine Liquid Reagents
Assay and Diazyme Creatinine Control were tested on a Hitachi 917 analyzer
using a real time study extending at least one month beyond the selected
expiration date. Testing was done at intervals of 0, 3, 6, 9 months and is still
ongoing. The Diazyme Creatinine Liquid Reagents and controls are stored at
refrigerated (2-8oC) and the expiration is at least 12 months.
The opened vial (in use) stability of the Diazyme Creatinine Liquid Reagents
Assay and Diazyme Creatinine Control were tested on a Hitachi 917 analyzer
with different intervals using accelerated studies. The real time on-board
stability studies were done at day 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35. The on-board
stability of the reagents is at least 30 days. The control is stable for at least 1
month when stored at 2-8oC.
d. Detection limit:
The lower limit of the assay range was determined by measuring a Limit of
Blank (LOB). The LOB of the Diazyme Creatinine assay was determined by
assaying the Diazyme Creatinine zero calibrator in 12 replicates on the Hitachi
917 instrument. The LOB was defined as mean + 3SD. The sponsor claimed
that the lower limit of the assay is 0.14 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could
interfere with the method. The interfering substances were evaluated in
serum and urine pools that had different creatinine concentrations. The
sponsor defined interference as samples for which the analyte recovery
varies from the base recovery by more than ± 10%. The summary of the
results of the recovery studies is provided in the table below:
Serum Urine
