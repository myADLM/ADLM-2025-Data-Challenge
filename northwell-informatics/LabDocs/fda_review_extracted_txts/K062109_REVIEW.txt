2. Comparison with predicate:
A total of 1183 prospective specimens collected from children (less than 18
years of age) and adults (18 years or older) were evaluated in the BinaxNOW®
Influenza A & B Test and compared to culture/DFA. Evaluated specimens
include nasopharyngeal, nasal, and throat swabs and nasal wash/aspirates
collected from patients presenting with influenza-like symptoms. Forty-three
percent (43%) of the population tested was male, 57% female, 52% pediatric
(< 18 years), and 48% adult (> 18 years). No differences in test performance
were observed based on patient age or gender. A/H3 and A/H1 were the
predominant influenza subtypes observed during this time.

Page 3 of 7
A blind study of the BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Test was conducted at
3 separate sites using panels of blind coded specimens containing
negative, low positive, and moderate positive samples. Participants tested
each sample multiple times on 3 different days. There was 96.8%
(242/250) agreement with expected test results, with no significant
differences within run (replicates tested by one operator), between run (3
different days), between sites (3 sites), or between operators (6 operators).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: NA
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
method):
NA
d. Detection limit:
The BinaxNOW® test limit of detection (LoD), defined as the
concentration of influenza virus that produces positive BinaxNOW® test
results approximately 95% of the time, was identified by evaluating
different concentrations of inactivated Flu A/Beijing and inactivated Flu
B/Harbin in the BinaxNOW® test.
Twelve (12) different operators each interpreted 2 devices run at each
concentration for a total of 24 determinations per level. The following
results identify a concentration of 1.03 x 102 ng/ml as the LoD for Flu
A/Beijing and 6.05 x 101 ng/ml for Flu B/Harbin.

Retrospective Study
A total of 293 retrospective frozen clinical samples were evaluated in the
BinaxNOW® Influenza A & B Test and compared to culture/DFA. All
clinical samples were collected from symptomatic patients at multiple
physician offices, clinics and hospitals located in the Southern, Northeastern
and Midwestern regions of the United States and from one hospital in
Sweden. Fifty-three percent (53%) of the population tested was male, 47%
female, 62% pediatric (<18 years) and 38% adult (≥ 18 years). Nasal
wash/aspirate specimens comprised approximately 61% of the samples tested,
while NP swabs represented 39%. No differences in test performance were
observed based on patient age and gender or based on sample type tested.
BinaxNOW® A & B Test performance by sample type versus cell
culture/DFA, including 95% confidence intervals, is listed below.

Analytical Sensitivity:
The BinaxNOW® test limit of detection (LOD), defined as the concentration of
influenza virus that produces positive BinaxNOW® test results approximately
95% of the time, was identified by evaluating different concentrations of
inactivated Flu A/Beijing and inactivated Flu B/Harbin in the BinaxNOW® test.
Twelve (12) different operators each interpreted 2 devices run at each
concentration for a total of 24 determinations per level. The following results
identify a concentration of 1.03 x 102 ng/ml as the LOD for Flu A/Beijing and
6.05 x 101 ng/ml for Flu B/Harbin.

a. Other clinical supportive data (when a and b are not applicable):
3. Clinical cut-off: NA
4. Expected values/Reference range:
The prevalence of influenza varies from year to year, with outbreaks typically
occurring during the fall and winter months.1 The rate of positivity found in
influenza testing is dependent on many factors including the method of
specimen collection, the test method used, geographic location, and the
disease prevalence in specific localities. Type A viruses are typically
associated with most serious influenza epidemics, while Type B are typically
milder. In multi-center clinical studies conducted by Binax outside the U.S.
during the 2004 respiratory season and in the US during the 2004-2005
respiratory season, the average prevalence of influenza A (as determined by
viral cell culture) was 18%. The average prevalence of influenza B was 3%.
