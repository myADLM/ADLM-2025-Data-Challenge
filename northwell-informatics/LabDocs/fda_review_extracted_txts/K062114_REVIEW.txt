L. Test Principle:
The COBAS INTEGRA Ceruloplasmin cassette is an immunoturbidimetic assay. A
sample is mixed with the antibody solution (R2). If ceruloplasmin is present in the
sample, it will form a precipitate with the specific antiserum which is determined
turbidimetrically at 340 nm. The signal generated is proportional to the concentration
of ceruloplasmin in the sample. The concentration of ceruloplasmin is determined
from a standard curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated according to CLSI EP5-T2. Five samples were
assayed in duplicate in the morning and in the afternoon for 20 days on the
COBAS INTEGRA 700 using a single reagent lot. The samples consisted of
two commercial controls (Roche Serumproteins T and DakoCytomation
Human Serum Protein) and two serum pools with different concentrations of
ceruloplasmin (0.204-0.594 g/L). For each sample, the mean, standard
deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated for within-
run, day-to-day and total precision. The acceptable criteria for within-run and
day-to-day %CV are ≤ 4% and ≤ 6% respectively. Precision results are
summarized below.

A second precision study was performed to evaluate samples in the low and
high end of the measuring range. The samples consisted of 1 calibrator, 2
controls (Precinorm and Precipath) and 6 human serum samples
(ceruloplasmin concentrations of 0.092, 0.099, 0.181, 0.297, 1.337 and 1.461
g/L). The samples were assayed three times a day for 10 days. The %CV for
between-day ranged from 0.51% to 4.25% and for total precision 0.89% to
5.67%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The assay reportable range is 0.03 g/L to 1.40 g/L. The extended measuring
range with a recommended dilution factor of 3 is 0.03 g/L to 4.20 g/L. Values
outside of the reportable range are flagged by the instrument. Users can select
an automatic rerun with dilution if they use COBAS INTEGRA 800, 700,
400/400 Plus or 800 CTS. The recommended dilution factor is 3.
Linearity was determined by assaying serial dilutions of 4 human serum pool
spiked with different concentrations of human ceruloplasmin on the COBAS
INTEGRA 700. The ceruloplasmin concentrations for Pool A, B, C and D
were 1.71, 0.654, 0.312 and 0.21 g/L respectively. For Pool A the serial
dilutions were from 1.71 to 0.156 g/L, Pool B from 0.654 to 0.067 g/L, Pool C
0.312 to 0.031 g/L and Pool D, 0.21 to 0.044 g/L. Each dilution was assayed
in quadruplicate except for those of Pool A which were run in duplicate. The
acceptance criterion is 5% from the regression line. Results showed assay is
linear in the range of 0.03-1.70 g/L.
High-Dose Hook Effect
For this study19 serially diluted samples of DAKO Human Serum Protein
High Control were analyzed in duplicate without sample predilution. Results
showed that no high dose effect up to 13.23 g/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrator and controls are traceable to the IFCC/BCR/CAP reference
preparation CRM 470 (RPPHS 91/0619).
d. Detection limit/analytical sensitivity:
The detection limit is the lowest measurable analyte level that can be
distinguished from zero. It is calculated as the value three standard deviations
(SD) above the mean value of 30 replicates of the zero calibrator (water)
assayed on a COBAS INTEGRA 400 analyzer. The mean value was 0.011
g/L with a SD of 0.002 g/L. The detection limit is therefore, 0.017 g/L.
e. Analytical specificity:

Endogenous substances: Interference studies were performed according to
CLSI document EP7-P. Three human serum pools containing ceruloplasmin
(0.16 – 0.494 g/L) were spiked with varying concentrations of each of the
following interferents: hemoglobin, conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin
and triglycerides. Each interferent concentration was tested in quadruplicate.
The spiked and unspiked samples were analyzed on the COBAS INTEGRA
700 analyzer. Percent recovery was calculated. Results were within the
acceptable limit of ≥ 90% recovery and supported the claims that no
interference was found for the interferent concentrations tested (hemoglobin
up to 10 g/L, conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin up to 600 mg/L and
triglycerides up to 25 g/L).
Rheumatoid factor: Rheumatoid factor interference was determined by testing
two patient samples with a medium and high ceruloplasmin concentration
(0.289 g/L and 0.452 g/L) spiked with increasing concentrations of RF (IgM).
Spiked and unspiked samples were analyzed on a COBAS INTEGRA. No
significant interference was observed up to a RF concentration of 400 IU/mL.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The predicate device is the DakoCytomation Polyclonal Rabbit Anti-Human
Ceruloplasmin Test System. A total of 97 retrospective archived serum
samples with ceruloplasmin concentrations ranging from 0.11 g/L to 0.59 g/L
were tested. The samples were measured in duplicate. The new device was
run on the Roche/INTEGRA 700 analyzer and the predicate device on
COBAS MIRA Plus. All testing were performed at Roche GmbH. Results
were analyzed by linear regression and Passing-Bablok analysis. Linear
regression analysis gave a slope of 1.034, a y-intercept of 0.012 and
correlation coefficient (r) of 0.987. Passing-Bablok analysis gave a slope of
1.00 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.053), intercept of 0.00 (95%CI: -0.019, 0.00) and r of
0.978.
Since this study only evaluated samples with ceruloplasmin concentration in
the reference range, the sponsor was requested to provide additional data for
samples above 0.59 g/L and below 0.11 g/L. A second comparison study was
performed using the Dade Behring Ceruloplasmin assay on the BN II
(k053074) because the DakoCytomation Polyclonal Rabbit Anti-Human
Ceruloplasmin Test System is unavailable. The Dade Behring Ceruloplasmin
assay on the BN II is an immunonephelometric assay and not a turbidimetric
assay. A total of 57 samples with ceruloplasmin concentration ranged from
0.051 g/L to 1.15 g/L were tested. Linear regression analysis yielded a slope
of 0.999 (95% CI: 0.953, 1.045) and a y-intercept of -0.0125 (95%CI: -
0.0292, 0.0043). Passing-Bablok analysis gave a slope of 0.915 (95% CI:
0.877, 0.966), intercept of 0.014 (95%CI: -0.0028, 0.0208) and r of 0.986.

Platform comparison
For this study, 91 serum samples with ceruloplasmin concentration ranging
from 0.152 g/L to 1.016 g/L were assayed on the COBAS c501 and the
COBAS INTEGRA 700 instrument systems. Linear regression analysis
yielded a slope of 0.97 (95%CI: 0.95, 1.00) and y-intercept of 0.0195 (95%CI:
0.0098, 0.0293). Passing-Bablok analysis yielded a slope of o.98 (95%CI:
0.96, 1.01) and a y-intercept of 0.0211 (95%CI: 0.0113, 0.0301).
b. Matrix comparison:
For this study, 46 serum/lithium heparin plasma paired samples with
ceruloplasmin concentrations covering the reference range were assayed on
the COBAS c501. Percent recoveries ranged from 89% to 105%. Linear
regression analysis yielded a slope of 0.98 (95%CI: 0.92, 1.03) and a y-
intercept of -0.0195 (95% CI: -0.168, 0.0164). Passing-Bablok analysis gave
a slope of 0.98 and an intercept of 0.021.
