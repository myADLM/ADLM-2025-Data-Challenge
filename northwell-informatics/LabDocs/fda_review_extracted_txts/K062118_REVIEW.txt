L. Test Principle:
Glucose is phosphorylated with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the reaction
catalyzed by hexokinase (HK). The product, glucose-6-phosphate (G P) is then
6
oxidized with the concomitant reduction of NAD to NADH in the reaction catalyzed
by glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G PDH). The formation of NADH causes
6
an increase in absorbance at 340nm. The increase is directly proportional to the
amount of glucose in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Linearity was assessed by analyzing dilutions of calibrators. The linearity of
glucose on the Pointe 360 was evaluated by comparing observed versus expected
values across the expected range. The sponsors acceptance criteria was ±10%
compared to the expected value. Results are summarized below.

Least squares regression analysis gave the following linear equation: Observed =
1.001(Expected) -1.5.
A low end linearity study was also performed to determine the linearity at
concentrations from 0 to 45 mg/dL. A linear regression analysis was performed
on the data and plotted. The sponsors acceptance criteria was ±10% compared to
the expected value. Results are summarized below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrator used with this assay (Pointe Scientific, Inc. Multi-Analyte
Chemistry Calibrator) was cleared under k070207, and the control used with this
assay was cleared under k981339 (Consolidated Technologies, Inc. Quickcheck
Lyophilized Chemistry Control Conforma).
d. Detection limit:
The lower limit of detection (LoD) was determined using CLSI EP17-A by
running replicates of 20 for a zero and low level (5 mg/dL) sample. The LoD was
found to be 0.5 mg/dL for the glucose assay when used on the Pointe 360. The
sponsor will claim a lower limit of detection of 1.0 mg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference was evaluated. Bias is the difference in the results between the
control sample (without the interferant) and the test sample’s (contains the
interferant) 95% confidence interval. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria is a bias
not exceeding 16 mg/dL for bilirubin, 16.3 mg/dL for hemoglobin, and 13 mg/dL
for intralipid being considered interference (which equate to 10% change in the
glucose concentration tested). Results are summarized below.

Bilirubin 3 14.6 mg/dL 157.0 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 3 305 mg/dL 163.3 mg/dL
Intralipid 3 1000 mg/dL 133.7 mg/dL
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor performed a method comparison study with the predicate device
using clinical samples. The study was performed using 100 samples ranging
from 53 to 370 mg/dL for serum and 99 samples from 64 to 546 mg/dL for
plasma. Results are summarized below.
