L. Test Principle:
Not applicable. This submission is for calibrators.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The new calibrator is prepared by adding calculated quantities of analytes to
the base matrix (bovine serum). The concentration is verified using an
instrument calibrated with the master calibrator pools. The final bottle
assignment is assigned for the level of the commercial lot by testing N=20
replicates with multiple reagent lots on multiple instruments.
The assigned values of DRUG 2 CAL are traceable to USP Reference
Materials except for NAPA which is traceable to All-Tech Applied Sciences
Reference Standard.
Assigned values for a typical lot of DRUG 2 CAL is presented in the
following table:
Level Units ACTM CRBM DGTX GENT LIDO NAPA PROC TOBR VALP VANC
1 ug/mL 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
5 ug/mL 302.1 22.0 83.0 11.6 12.5 33.4 21.2 13.4 164.1 48.6
The Calibrators are stable for 12 months when stored at 2 to 8 ºC. A vial
punctured by the instrument and stored on board the analyzer is stable for 24
hours. Opened vials stored at 2 to 8 ºC are stable for 31 days. Protocols and
acceptance criteria for stability testing were described and found to be
acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
