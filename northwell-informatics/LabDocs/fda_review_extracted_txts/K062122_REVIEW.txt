L. Test Principle:
Not applicable. This submission is for calibrator materials.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrator is prepared by adding calculated quantities of analytes into
purified water. The concentration is verified using an instrument calibrated
with the master calibrator pools. The final bottle assignment is assigned for
the level of the commercial lot by testing N=45 replicates with multiple
reagent lots on multiple instruments.
The assigned values of the alcohol are traceable to USP Grade Alcohol and of
the Carbon Dioxide are traceable to NIST SRM 351.

The calibrator materials are stable for 12 months when stored at 2 to 8 ºC. A
vial punctured by the instrument and stored on board the analyzer is stable for
24 hours. Opened vials stored at 2 to 8 ºC are stable for 31 days. Protocols and
acceptance criteria for stability testing were described and found to be
acceptable.
