overdose.
The VITROS Chemistry Products COCM assay is intended for use by
professional laboratory personnel. It provides only a preliminary test result. A
more specific alternative chemical method must be used to confirm a result
obtained with this assay. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment
should be applied to any drug-of-abuse test result, particularly when evaluating a
preliminary positive result.
VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 26 is used to calibrate VITROS 5,1
FS Chemistry Systems for the qualitative or semi-quantative measurement of the
drugs of abuse.
VITROS Chemistry Products FS Calibrator 1 is used in conjunction with
VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kits to calibrate VITROS 5,1 FS
Chemistry Systems.
VITROS Chemistry Products DAT Performance Verifiers are assayed controls
used to monitor performance of urine drugs of abuse screening assays on
VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
This device is for prescription use by professional laboratory personnel. For in
vitro diagnostic use only.

which drugs of abuse, metabolites of drugs of abuse, organic salts, surfactants and
preservative have been added.
VITROS Chemistry Products FS Calibrator 1 is prepared from sodium chloride and
processed water.
VITROS DAT Performance Verifiers I, II, III, IV & V are prepared from a human
urine pool to which analytes, surfactant and preservative have been added.

The assay is based on competition between benzoylecgonine in the treated urine
sample and the benzoylecgonine labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6P-DH) for antibody binding sites. Enzyme activity decreases upon
binding to the antibody, therefore the concentration of benzoylecgonine in the urine
sample is directly proportional to measured enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts
oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to NADH, resulting in an
absorbance change that is measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Imprecision was evaluated with human urine-based quality control materials
on the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System following CLSI Protocol EP5 and
CLSI protocol EP12.
The sponsor cautions that variables such as instrument maintenance,
environment, reagent storage/handling, control material reconstitution, and
sample handling can affect the reproducibility of test results.

each cutoff. The imprecision was determined as the confidence level of
obtaining a correct result with known positive or negative fluids.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor followed CLSI EP6-A in determining the linear range of their device.
Two urine pools were prepared with benzoylecgonine concentrations at the
low (0 ng/mL) and high (1200 ng/mL) end of the calibration range. The two
pools were mixed to give 18 admixtures of intermediate concentrations.
Linearity was evaluated using three assay reagent lots and comparing the
measured results against the expected results from 18 pooled samples. A
linear regression was performed and the results indicated acceptable linearity
across the benzoylecgonine concentration range tested 47 to 1007 ng/mL.
This linearity determination in conjunction with determination of the limit of
quantation was used to establish the semi-quantitative range of the VITROS
COCM assay (50-1000 ng/mL).
Recovery study
Eleven admixtures were prepared from two human urine pools.
Benzoylecgonine values for the admixtures were calculated based on the
gravimetric addition with GC/MS verification of the high pool and the
percentage of high pool to the low pool (a drug-free urine based matrix).
Percent recovery was calculated using the concentration obtained by the
VITROS Chemistry Products COCM Assay versus the calculated
benzoylecgonine value.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The assigned values for the calibrators and controls are traceable to the
Cerilliant benzoylecgonine standard catalogue B-028 and are verified by
GC/MS.
Real time and accelerated stability studies were conducted; protocols and
acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. These studies
support the manufacturer’s stability claims. Real time studies are ongoing.

d. Detection limit:
The limit of quantitation (LOQ) is defined as the minimum amount of analyte whose presence
can be quantitatively determined with stated acceptable precision and trueness under defined
experimental conditions.
The limit of detection (LOD) is the minimum amount of analyte whose
presence can be quantitatively detected under defined conditions. For the
VITROS COCM assay, the LOD was determined to be 31 ng/mL. The limit
of quantitation (LOQ) was determined to be 50 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The specificity of the VITROS COCM assay for various cocaine metabolites
and structurally similar compounds was estimated by generating a dose
response curve for each of the compounds listed below. The quantity (ng/mL)
of compound that produces a value equivalent to the benzoylecgonine quantity
(ng/mL) at each cutoff value is listed below. The combined effects of more
than one compound detected in a sample may cause levels lower than those
listed below to produce a value approximately equivalent to or greater than the
cutoff value.

according to CLSI Protocol EP7 and found not to interfere (defined by the
