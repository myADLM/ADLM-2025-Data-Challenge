The UDAT CAL is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of
Amphetamines/Methamphetamines (AMPH), Barbiturates (BARB),
Benzodiazepines (BENZ), Cocaine Metabolite (COC), Methadone (METH),
Methaqualone (MTQ), Opiates (OPI), Phencyclidine (PCP), Propoxyphene
(PRX), and Cannabinoids (THC) methods on the Dimension Vista™ System.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Dade Behring Dimension Vista System
I. Device Description:
The UDAT CAL is a liquid, multi-analyte, drug free human urine based calibrator
consisting of 6 vials (three of calibrator A and three of calibrator B). Calibrator A
vials contain 2.5 mL and Calibrator B vials contain 2.6 mL. The component,
constituent, and assigned values are listed in the table below. Intermediate levels are
prepared and corresponding values calculated by the instrument.
Component Source Level A Level B
(ng/mL) (ng/mL)
Amphetamines 300 d-methamphetamine 0 1000
Amphetamines 500 d-methamphetamine 0 1000
Amphetamines d-methamphetamine 0 2000

BARB Secobarbital 0 800
BENZ Lormetazepam 0 1000
COC 150 Benzoylecogonine 0 1000
COC 300 Benzoylecogonine 0 1000
METH Methadone 0 1000
MTQ Methaqualone 0 1000
OPI 300 Morphine 0 2000
OPI 2000 Morphine 0 4000
PCP Phencyclidine 0 75
PRX Propoxyphene 0 500
THC 11-nor-delta 9-THC-9- 0 100
COOH
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
The predicate for the UDAT CAL is the Syva EMIT Calibrators/controls (k993755).
The UDAT CAL has the same intended use, analytes, form, matrix and traceability.

Stability
The sponsor conducted real-time stability studies with the multi-drug
calibrator. When punctured (open vial) by the instrument, the vial is stable on
board for 24 hours. A non-punctured (open) vial is stable in the refrigerator
for 31 days. The closed stability for the UDAT CAL is 9 months.
Value assignment
The new calibrator master lot is made by gravimetrically adding quantities of
the reference material into drug free normal human urine. The master lot (5
levels) are stored at -70°C and verified by recovery and GC/MS testing. The
commercial lot stock solution is prepared by gravimetrically adding the
analytes to form the target concentration. The commercial stock solution
concentration is verified by comparing the master lot assigned values. The
commercial lot is prepared by adding calculated quantities of the commercial
stock solution to drug free normal human urine to the two level target
concentrations. The concentration of the commercial lot is verified to be
within acceptable ranges using an instrument calibrated with the master lot
and GC/MS testing.
