H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use.
2. Indication(s) for use:
VITROS Chemistry Products BARB Reagent: For in vitro diagnostic use only. VITROS
Chemistry Products BARB Reagent is used on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems for the semi-
quantitative or qualitative determination of barbiturates (BARB) in human urine using a cutoff of
200 ng/mL or 300 ng/mL. Measurements obtained with the VITROS BARB method are used in
the diagnosis and treatment of barbiturates use or overdose.
The VITROS Chemistry Products BARB assay is intended for use by professional
laboratory personnel. It provides only a preliminary test result. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used to confirm a result with this assay. Gas
Chromatograpy/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method.
Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug-of-abuse
test result, particularly when evaluating a preliminary positive result.

L. Test Principle:
The VITROS BARB assay is a homogenous immunoassay based on the competition between
barbiturates in the treated urine sample and secobarbital labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6P-DH) for antibody binding sites. Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the
antibody, therefore the concentration of barbiturates in the urine sample is directly proportional to
measured enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD+) to NADH, resulting in an absorbance change that is measured spectrophotometrically.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Semi-quantitative precision was assessed with quality control materials on the VITROS 5,1 FS
Chemistry System following CLSI Protocol EP5 and EP12. The samples were run in
duplicate, twice a day for twenty-two days using two reagent lots and four instruments. Each
run consisted of five control fluids to assess assay imprecision at approximately ± 25% of the
200 and 300 ng/mL cutoff concentrations. The results are presented in the table below.

Qualitative imprecision was assessed using drug-spiked human urine pools with concentrations
targeted at approximately ± 25% of the 200 and 300 ng/mL cutoff concentrations. The
concentrations of the targeted test fluids were confirmed by GC/MS. The sponsor performed
one to two runs per day with two replicates per run for 22 days using a single lot of reagent on
one analyzer. The results are presented below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor followed CLSI EP6-A: “Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Analytical
Methods; Approved Guideline” in determining the linear range of their device.
Number of reagent lots: 3
Replicates of each solution: 3
Two urine pools were prepared with barbiturate concentrations at the low (0 ng/mL) and high
(1000 ng/mL) end of the calibration range. The two pools were mixed to give 13 admixtures of
intermediate barbiturate concentrations. Linearity was evaluated using three assay reagent lots
and comparing the measured results against the expected results from 13 pooled samples. A
linear regression was performed and the results indicated acceptable linearity across the
concentration range tested (3 – 890 ng/mL). The claimed reportable range of the VITROS
BARB assay is 60 - 800 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The assigned values for the calibrators and controls are traceable to the Cerillant secobarbital
standard catalogue S-005 and are verified by GC/MS.
Real time and accelerated stability studies were conducted; protocols and acceptance criteria
were described and found to be acceptable. These studies support the sponsor’s
stability claims for the following products:

The sponsor determined that a high specific gravity does not interfere with
the assay by evaluating the primary causes of high specific gravity: high
concentrations of NaCl, protein and glucose in urine.
The specificity of VITROS BARB assay for common barbiturates and structurally
similar compounds was determined by generating a dose response curve for each
of the compounds and determining the approximate quantity of each compound
that is equivalent in assay reactivity to a secobarbital 200 ng/mL and 300 ng/mL
cutoff.

A total of 102 unaltered human urine samples were assayed on the device and a
commercially available immunoassay method for barbiturates. Percent
agreement was evaluated at assay cutoff values of 200 and 300 ng/mL. To
challenge performance at the 200 ng/mL cutoff value, 25 of the 102 samples
tested had concentrations within +/- 50% of the cutoff value, 10 samples below
the cutoff value and 15 above the cutoff value. To challenge performance at the
300 ng/mL cutoff value, 54 of the 102 samples tested had concentrations within
+/- 50% of the cutoff value, 25 samples below the cutoff value and 29 above the
cutoff value.
