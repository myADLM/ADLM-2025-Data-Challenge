L. Test Principle:
The substrate 4,6-ethylidene-(G7)-p-nitrophenyl-(G1)-α-D-maltoheptaoside (EPS-G7) is
cleaved by α-amylases into various fragments. These are further hydrolyzed in a second
step by α-glucosidase producing glucose and p-nitrophenol. The increase in absorbance
represents the total (pancreatic and salivary) amylase activity in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To evaluate within run precision, the sponsor selected two controls and three
serum samples. Each sample was run 20 times in a single run with the following
results:
Control Sample
Normal Abnormal Low Medium High
Mean (U/L) 74.6 180.6 50.0 89.2 258.4
SD 0.51 1.28 0.89 1.05 1.56
CV(%) 0.69 0.71 1.78 1.18 0.60

CV(%)	0.69	0.71	1.78	1.18	0.60

--- Page 6 ---
Page 6 of 9
To evaluate between run and total precision, the sponsor followed CLSI EP-5A. Two
controls and two serum samples were tested in duplicate for 20 days, with two
replicates per day, for a total of four results per day and 80 results total for each sample.
The following results were observed:
Control Sample
Normal Abnormal Low High
Mean (U/L) 76.7 184.1 71.5 415.0
Within-Run SD 0.75 1.32 0.84 2.79
Within-Run CV 0.98 0.72 1.18 0.67
Total SD 2.07 3.21 1.96 7.19

Between-Day CV 2.09 1.01 2.23 1.17
Between-Run SD 1.07 2.26 0.77 4.50
Between-Run CV 1.39 1.23 1.07 1.08
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To evaluate linearity and reportable range, the sponsor followed CLSI EP-6A.
Two datasets were collected, one covering the lower range from approximately 7
– 150 U/L and another covering the upper range from approximately 100 – 2200
U/L. The CLSI guideline instructs users to examine whether a non-linear
polynomial fits the data better than a linear one and then assess whether the
difference between the two is less than the amount of allowable bias for the
method. The sponsor did this, and determined that for both datasets the difference
was less than their internal estimate of 8% allowable bias.
In addition, post dilution studies were performed to validate the automated
dilution function and range.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrator. The sponsor states that the Multical calibrator is traceable to the
Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM)/ International
Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) reference
material 456 for amylase.
Real-time stability data has been provided at the recommended storage
temperature for both open and closed vials. The acceptance criterion was
recovery ± 5% of day 0 value.
Calibrator values are assigned by comparison to a master lot stored at -80o C.
Deviations of up to 4% are allowed.

Controls. Real-time stability data has been provided at the recommended storage
temperature for both open and closed vials. The acceptance criterion was
recovery ± 10% of day 0 value.
Control values are assigned from the ABX PENTRA calibrator, reagents and
analyzers. The target value is determined by the median of results from 150
measurements. Six analyzers are used over 5 days, with one calibration per day.
Confidence range is determined as the calculated range in percent which is based
on the experimental results from the previous target value trials. The range
declared in the target value sheet is equal to the assigned value +/- 3 standard
deviations.
d. Detection limit:
Method : In accordance with the Valtec guideline (Vassault et al., Ann. Biol.
Clin., 1986, (44), 686-745)
Minimum Detection Limit (MDL) is calculated from 30 measurements of saline
water (0.9 g/l)

when negative)

From the MDL value, the test range low assigned for this method and in the test
instruction was calculated to be 4 U/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Hemoglobin up to 278 µmol/l (479 mg/dl), total bilirubin up to 450 µmol/l
(29 mg/dl), direct bilirubin up to 474 µmol/l (27.7 mg/dl) and triglycerides (as
Intralipid ®, representative of lipemia) up to 7 mmol/l (612.5 mg/dl) were tested
by the sponsor and found not to interfere with Amylase determination by this
method. Potential interferents were tested at two amylase concentrations. The
sponsor defined non-interference as the following: within ± 20 U/L for the low
concentration (approximately 136 U/L) and within ± 50 U/L for the high
concentration test sample (approximately 287 U/L).
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Due to the difficulty of obtaining native samples covering the reportable range of
the assay, the sponsor supplemented the native samples with both diluted and
spiked samples, for a total of 131 samples. Each sample was analyzed in
duplicate and the samples ranged in concentration from 4 to 1659 U/L by the
predicate method. Linear regression was performed comparing the mean of
predicate vs the mean of the new device, and the following line equation was
calculated:
Horiba ABX = (*1.231 X predicate method) – 26 U/L
r = 0.9985
*From the data provided, it appears that the positive bias increases as amylase
values increase. However, this bias was judged to be clinically insignificant.
b. Matrix comparison:
To demonstrate comparable performance between serum and lithium-heparin
plasma, the sponsor compared 70 paired serum and plasma samples on the Pentra
400 analyzer using the ABX Pentra Amylase CP reagent. The samples ranged in
concentration from a low of 24 to a high of 255 U/L. Linear regression produced
a slope of 1.00 with a y-intercept of -2.6 U/L. The correlation coefficient (r) was
0.998.
