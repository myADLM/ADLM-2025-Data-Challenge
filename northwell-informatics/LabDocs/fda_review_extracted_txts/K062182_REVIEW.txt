3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Dade Behring Dimension Vista™ System
I. Device Description:
The EXTC CAL is a liquid, multi-analyte, drug free human urine based calibrator
consisting of 6 vials (three of calibrator A and three of calibrator B). Calibrator A
vials and Calibrator B vials contain 2.3 mL. The component, constituent, and
assigned values are listed in the table below. Intermediate levels are prepared and
corresponding values calculated by the instrument.
Component Source Level A Level B
(ng/mL) (ng/mL)
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine Methylenedioxymethamphetamine 0 1000
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
The predicate for the EXTC CAL is the Syva EMIT II Plus Ecstasy
calibrators/controls (k043028). The EXTC CAL has the same intended use, analytes,
form, matrix and traceability. The only noted difference is that the EXTC CAL has
two levels whereas the predicate has four levels.

L. Test Principle:
Not applicable (N/A)
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
N/A
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
N/A
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The methylenedioxymethamphetamine reference material (99% purity) for the
EXTC CAL are traceable to a commercially available provider.
Stability
The sponsor conducted real-time stability studies with the multi-drug
calibrator. When punctured (open vial) by the instrument, the vial is stable on
board for 24 hours. A non-punctured (open) vial is stable in the refrigerator
for 31 days. The closed stability for the EXTC CAL is 12 months.
Value assignment
The new calibrator master lot is made by gravimetrically adding quantities of
the reference material into drug free normal human urine. The master lot (5
levels) are stored at -70°C and verified by recovery and GC/MS testing. The
commercial lot stock solution is prepared by gravimetrically adding the
analytes to form the target concentration. The commercial stock solution
concentration is verified by comparing the master lot assigned values. The
commercial lot is prepared by adding calculated quantities of the commercial
stock solution to drug free normal human urine to the two level target
concentrations. The concentration of the commercial lot is verified to be
within acceptable ranges using an instrument calibrated with the master lot
