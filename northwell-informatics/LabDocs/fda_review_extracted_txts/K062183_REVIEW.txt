K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle:
Calibrators, controls, and diluted patient samples are added to the wells and
autoantibodies recognizing the dsDNA antigen bind during the first incubation. After
washing the wells to remove all unbound proteins, purified peroxidase labeled rabbit
anti-human IgG (γ chain specific) conjugate is added. The conjugate binds to the
captured human autoantibody and the excess unbound conjugate is removed by a
further wash step. The unbound conjugate is removed by a further wash step. The
bound conjugate is visualized with 3,3’,5,5’ tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate
which gives a blue reaction product, the intensity of which is proportional to the
concentration of autoantibody in the sample. Phosphoric acid is added to each well to
stop the reaction. This produces a yellow end point color, which is read at 450nm.
The controls and patient results are compared to a 5 point calibration curve for
interpretation.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The intra- and inter-assay precisions were measured using 6 samples covering
the range of the calibration curve. Intra-assay precision was measured using
20 replicates in one assay. Inter-assay precision was measured by testing
samples in duplicate in 6 assays performed over 3 days.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrators are standardized against the WHO reference material Wo-80.
d. Detection limit:
Confirmation that the FARRZYME assay can distinguish between two
samples with values close to the bottom of the measuring range (120 and
165% of the lowest calibrator (12.3 IU/mL)) was obtained by statistical
analysis (Student’s t-test) of the results obtained from testing 20 replicates of
each sample.

Sample 1 20 20.30 1.06 5.25
Sample 2 20 14.96 0.97 6.49
e. Analytical specificity:
Various elevated serum components (free and conjugated bilirubin,
hemoglobin, chyle and rheumatoid factor) were added to low (normal) and
high (positive) sera which were then assayed to test the possible effect of
interfering substances provided in an Interference Check A plus kit (Kokusai,
Japan). No interference was observed at the following concentrations.
Substance Concentration
Bilirubin F (free) 20.3 mg/dL
Bilirubin C (conjugated) 20.2 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 486 mg/dL
Chyle 1460 Units
Rheumatoid factor 45 IU/mL
Interference due to high IgG was evaluated in a separate study by testing 6
IgG myeloma sera on the FARRZYME assay and all gave negative results.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off was established based on the results obtained from testing
samples from healthy blood donors (n=150). At the established cut-off of ≤30

IU/mL as negative and >30 IU/mL as positive, the 150 normal sera all gave
results below 17.0 IU/mL, with 146 (97%) of the results below 12.3 IU/mL.
Of the 224 SLE patients also tested, 36% of the patient sera gave a positive
result which is similar to the range found in the furnished literature of 28-63%
for an unselected (active versus inactive) population.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Two-hundred fifty-two samples including 189 from patients with SLE, 28
samples from healthy normals, and 35 samples positive for dsDNA antibodies
by C. luciliae or ELISA were tested by FARRZYME, by the TBS
conventional dsDNA ELISA and by the TBS CRITHIDIA LUCILIAE
immunofluorescent assay. The low positive agreements with both predicate
devices are due to the fact that both the conventional dsDNA ELISA and the
C. luciliae detect low, moderate and high avidity antibodies whereas the
FARRZYME only detects high avidity antibodies.

from patients with other diseases and samples known to contain other
autoimmune antibodies were run with the FARRZYME assay. The study results
were:
