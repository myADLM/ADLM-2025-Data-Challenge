c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The assigned values of the Dimension Vista™ System Drugs of
Abuse Positive Control and the Dimension Vista™ System Drugs of Abuse
Negative Control are traceable to Gas Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry
(GC/MS) Reference Testing.
Value Assignment
Calculated quantities of D-Methamphetamine, Secobarbital, Nordiazepam,
Benzoylecgonine, Methadone, Morphine, Phencyclidine, and 11-nor-Δ -THC-
9
9-COOH high purity stock solutions are added to drug free normal human
urine to target concentrations for each of the Negative and Positive Controls.
The Negative and Positive Bulk Products are tested by GC/MS and any
analyte that is out of the acceptable GC/MS range is adjusted and retested.
Values are assigned to the controls once the GC/MS results are in the
acceptable ranges.
Stability
Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable.
