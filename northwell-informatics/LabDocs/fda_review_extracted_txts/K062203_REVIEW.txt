H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Roche diagnostics Tina-Quant D-dimer assay is an immunoturbidimetric assay
for the in vitro quantitative determination of fibrin degradation products including d-
dimer and x-oligomers in human plasma. In conjunction with a non-high clinical
probability assessment, a normal (<0.5 µg FEU/mL) result excludes deep vein
thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) with high sensitivity.
2. Indication(s) for use:
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
4. Special instrument requirements:
Roche automated clinical chemistry analyzers
I. Device Description:
The Roche Tina-quant D-dimer is an immunoturbidimetric assay consisting of a
ready to use tris buffer and a ready to use anti-d-dimer latex suspension.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
a. Roche Diagnostics Tina-Quant D-Dimer Test System
b. Biomerieux Vidas D-Dimer Exclusion Assay
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):

L. Test Principle:
The Tina-quant D-Dimer Test System is based on a particle enhanced
immunoturbidimetric method. Latex particles of uniform size are coated with
monoclonal antibodies (F(ab’)2 fragments) to the D-dimer epitope. The
antigen/antibody complexes produced by the addition of samples containing D-dimer
lead to an increase in the turbidity of the test reactants, which can be determined

a. Clinical Sensitivity:
DVT Exclusion
Tina-Quant® D-dimer was used in a multicenter management study involving
812 outpatients with suspected DVT. Patient pre-test probability (PTP) was
assessed following Wells probability score. Patients were classified as high
(≥3) or non-high (<3), and the Tina-Quant® D-dimer test was then performed
using a cutoff of 0.5 µg FEU/mL. Those patients with a normal (negative) d-
dimer, and a non-high pretest probability had no further diagnostic testing and
were followed for 3 months for development of DVT. 1 of 176 such patients
developed DVT during the follow-up period. Sensitivity, NPV and Failure
rates were determined as follows:
Sensitivity: 99.3%
NPV 99.4%
Failure Rate: 0.6%
PE Exclusion
Tina-Quant® D-Dimer was used in a management study involving 168
outpatients with suspected PE. Patient pre-test probability (PTP) was assessed
following Wells probability score for PE. Patients were classified as having a
low, moderate, or high pretest probability of PE, and the Tina-Quant® D-
dimer test was then performed using a cutoff of 0.5 µg FEU/mL. Those
patients with a normal (negative) d-dimer, and a non-high (low or moderate)
pretest probability had no further diagnostic testing and were followed for 3
months for development of PE. No patients developed PE during the follow-
up period. Sensitivity, NPV and Failure rates were determined as follows:
Sensitivity: 100%
NPV 100%
Failure Rate: 0%
b. Clinical specificity:
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
