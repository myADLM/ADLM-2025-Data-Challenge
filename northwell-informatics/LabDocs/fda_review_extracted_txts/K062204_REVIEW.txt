L. Test Principle:
Cortisol in the sample and anti-cortisol coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined to
create a reaction mixture. Cortisol present in the sample binds to the anti-cortisol coated
microparticles. After incubation, cortisol acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to the
reaction mixture. The cortisol acridinium-labeled conjugate competes for the available
binding sites on the anti-cortisol coated microparticles. Following a second incubation, the
microparticles are washed, and pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction
mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs).
An inverse relationship exists between the amount of cortisol in the sample and the RLUs
detected by the ARCHITECT i system optics.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed using CLSI guideline NCCLS EP5-A2: Evaluation of
Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods. Precision was run on
one ARCHITECT i2000 analyzer, and one ARCHITECT i2000SR analyzer, using
ARCHITECT Cortisol calibrators, Abbott MCC Controls and patient sample pools.
For 20 non-consecutive days, each sample was run in duplicate. After a minimum of
two hours within the same day, the samples were re-run in duplicate, resulting in a total
of 80 replicates for each control or patient pool. Calibration was performed on day one;
no recalibration was needed.
The data show that total %CV is less than 10% for both serum and urine samples. A
summary of the precision data is shown in the table below:

The data demonstrate that the assay is linear between 0.49 and 65.9 µg/dL and
supports the claimed reportable range of 0.8 to 59.8 µg/dL for both serum and
urine samples. (See Functional Sensitivity section below.) This linearity
evaluation was performed using serum pools. Urine was evaluated independently
as part of the imprecision (random error), correlation (bias) and auto-dilution
verifications.
ii.) A dilution/recovery study was performed for both the serum and urine samples
using manual and automatic dilution by the instrument. Five serum samples ranged
from 25.4 to 49.0 µg/dL and six urine samples ranged from 4.8 to 40.8 µg/dL were
used in the study. A 1:2 dilution recovery study was performed using the manual
procedure and the instrument’s automated procedure.
The dilution recovery study met the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria of differences
in recoveries of ≤ 15%. The serum and urine samples met the manufacturer’s design
goals with grand mean % recoveries of 99.0% and 93.9% for the manual procedure
and the automated procedure respectively.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The ARCHITECT Cortisol calibrators are matched to internal reference standards that
are manufactured gravimetrically using cortisol (USP Reference Standard). The
concentration values for these internal reference standards are assigned using LC-
MS/MS method. The LC-MS/MS calibration is verified by the Community Bureau of
Reference (BCR) 192 and 193 certified reference materials.
Stability
The ARCHITECT Cortisol calibrators are stable until the expiration date when stored
and handled as directed. The calibrators are supplied in liquid form, for storage at 2-
8oC, and ready to use.

Close-vial stability studies:
Real-time stability data supports a shelf life of 8 months. Real time studies remain
ongoing and shelf life may be lengthened based on the results obtained.
Open-vial stability studies:
Real time open-vial stability studies are ongoing.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank and the Limit of Detection:
The ARCHITECT Cortisol assay is designed to have a limit of detection (LoD) of
<0.8μg/dL. The limit of blank (LoB) and the LoD were determined based on the
CLSI guideline NCCLS EP17-A: Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection
and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline using proportions of false positives
(α) less than 5% and false negatives (β) less than 5%. These determinations were
performed using 60 blank and 120 low level samples on both the ARCHITECT i2000
and ARCHITECT i2000 SR analyzers.
Results:
ARCHITECT i2000 LoB= 0.234 μg/dL and LoD= 0.401ug/dL
ARCHITECT i2000SR LoB= 0.125 μg/dL and LoD= 0.255ug/dL
An assay claim of LoD=0.8ug/dL is supported by the data.
Based on the Linearity and LOD, the package insert claim for the reportable range for
the assay will be 0.81 to 59.8 µg/dL.
Functional Sensitivity:
The functional sensitivity of the ARCHITECT Cortisol assay was determined based
on the CLSI Guideline NCCLS EP17-A Protocols for Demonstration, Verification,
and Evaluation of Limits of Detection and Quantitation; Approved Guideline. Serum
and urine panels ranging in concentration from 0.1 to 2.1μg/dL were tested in
duplicate over 10 days on both ARCHITECT i2000 and ARCHITECT i2000 SR
analyzers using two reagent lots and two calibrations for a total of 40 replicates per
panel. The total % CVs were calculated and plotted against the mean concentration.
A reciprocal curve was fitted through the data and the functional sensitivity value was
calculated as the concentration corresponding to the 20% CV level of the fitted curve.
Results: At the upper 95% confidence limit, the lowest serum value exhibiting a 20%
CV was calculated to be 0.8μg/dL. At the upper 95% confidence limit, the lowest
urine value exhibiting a 20% CV was calculated to be 1μg/dL.

i.) An interference study was performed following the CLSI Guideline EP7-A2, Interference
Testing in Clinical Chemistry for the ARCHITECT Cortisol assay using serum specimens
with Cortisol levels between 5.1 and 34.2 µg/dL and urine samples between 4.6 and
37.9µg/dL. The interference from the following compounds was observed to be ≤
15% at the levels indicated.

ii.) The specificity of the ARCHITECT Cortisol assay was determined by studying the
cross-reactivity of compounds whose chemical structure or concurrent usage may
potentially interfere with the assay. Specificity of the assay was determined by
spiking each compound into hum serum specimens with Cortisol levels of
approximately 12 µg/dL. The % cross-reactivity results are shown in the following
table.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison studies:
The correlation studies for the ARCHITECT Cortisol assay were performed with both LC-
MS/MS and the Predicate Device (AxSYM Cortisol) to support the performance of the
ARCHITECT assay. The studies were conducted according to CLSI Guideline EP9,
Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples. Serum samples, ranging
from 1.5 to 52.5µg/dL of Cortisol, were tested comparing the ARCHITECT Cortisol assay
to the AxSYM Cortisol assay and LC-MS/MS. Urine samples, ranging from 0.8 to
46.8µg/dL of Cortisol, were tested comparing the ARCHITECT Cortisol assay to the
AxSYm Cortisol Assay. Urine samples, ranging from 0.8 to 51.1µg/dL Cortisol, were
tested comparing the ARCHITECT Cortisol assay to LC-MS/MS. All serum samples were
purchased clinical samples, none of which were spiked. All urine samples were also
purchased clinical samples; however, some were spiked in order to obtain high
concentration samples.

c. Instruments evaluations between ARCHITECT Cortisol i2000 and i2000SR:
The i2000 and i2000SR systems are in the ARCHITECT family of instruments differing
only by inclusion on the i2000SR of a) STAT sampling hardware and software, b)
composition and positioning of the RV loader and c) Auto Retesting software.
To confirm acceptable ARCHITECT Cortisol assay performance on the two related
systems, the following were tested on both platforms: a) precision, b) limit of detection, c)
functional sensitivity, d) method comparison. These characteristics were selected as they
are fitting indicators of overall performance.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
None
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Serum cortisol levels were determined by assaying samples drawn from 150 apparently
healthy individuals collected before 10am and after 5pm. Cortisol levels in urine were
determined by assaying 24-hour urine samples from 128 apparently healthy individuals.
The 95% reference interval was determined for each. The data is summarized in the table
below.
Specimen N Normal RangeNormal Range
ug/dL nmol/L
Serum Before 10am 150 3.7 - 19.4 101.2 - 535.7
Serum After 5pm 150 2.9 - 17.3 79.0 - 477.8
Specimen N Normal RangeNormal Range
ug/24 hours nmol/ 24 hours
24 hour Urine 128 4.3 - 176.0 11.8 - 485.6
N. Proposed Labeling:
