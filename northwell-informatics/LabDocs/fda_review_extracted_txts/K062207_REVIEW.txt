Enterococcus, and Streptococcus.
2. Indication(s) for use:
This application is indicated for cefuroxime with additional organism groups at

panels and removal of the limitation for Klebsiella pneumoniae from the original
premarket notification (k033362).
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
This submission is not intended for the removal of a limitation with Providencia
rettgeri which remains as: “Results for Providencia rettgeri have been excluded
in the Phoenix™ System and therefore no results will be reported. An alternate
method should be performed when these combinations are identified.”
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
This submission is for the AST Panel only. The ID System was not reviewed.
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST
Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and
equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™
Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST broth, which contains an AST
indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST broth is a cation-adjusted formulation
of Mueller-Hinton broth containing 0.01% Tween 80. After adding the indicator solution
to the AST inoculum the color is blue and after inoculation and incubation changes to
pink then to colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds. Inoculated panels are
barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System
instrument where the panels are continuously incubated at 350C. The AST has a final
inoculum of 5 x 105 CFU/ml. The instrument incubates, reads and records the results of
the biochemical substrates and antimicrobial agents and interprets the reactions to give an
ID of the isolate and MIC value and category interpretation of the antimicrobial agents.
Organisms growing in the presence of a given antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator,
signaling organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or
inhibited by a given antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do
not produce a color change. Additional interpretation is done using software driven

Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an AST result available between 4-16 hours.
This is only an autoread result; no manual readings are possible with this system.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S16) “Methods for
Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard.”
L. Test Principle:
The AST portion of the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth
based microdilution method that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-
reduction) to enhance detection of organism growth. The MIC is determined by
comparing growth in wells containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the
growth in “growth control wells” which contains no antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
The data included in this submission were acquired during the clinical studies
performed at multiple sites and described in the previous submission for
cefuroxime (k033362). The accuracy performance data for the additional
organism report groups for clinical and challenge isolates and each antimicrobial
agent are contained in this submission. The Reproducibility studies and Quality
Control (QC) performance data as previously submitted are presented for
reference purposes only.
In addition to the above clinical trial study, a supplemental study using challenge
isolates of resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae were evaluated to remove the
limitation for this report group in the previous submission for Cefuroxime - 1-64
μg/mL (k033362, April 13, 2004). The accuracy performance data for this
supplemental study are contained in this submission. The QC performance was
within the expected ranges as shown under the “Traceabality, Stability…. section
(c)”.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intersite and Intrasite testing demonstrated >95% reproducibility. The ten
isolate study described in the guidance document was used (10 organisms
tested 3 times on 3 days at 3 sites).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable

EA-Essential Agreement vmj – very major discrepancies
CA-Category Agreement maj - major discrepancies
R-resistant isolates min – minor discrepancies
Essential agreement (EA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panels agree with the
reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference
method. Category agreement (CA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panel result
interpretation (SIR) agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation.
Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the BD Phoenix™ and the
reference and have on-scale EA.
A trend was observed with the K. pneumoniae group where the BD Phoenix™ appears
to be more susceptible when compared to expected results of the challenge strains.
