L. Test Principle:
The AESKULISA® β2- Glyco-A, AESKULISA® β2- Glyco-GM and
AESKULISA® β2- Glyco-Check devices are solid phase enzyme immunoassays for
the semiquantitative and qualitative detection of IgA, IgG and/or IgM (separate), and
IgA, IgG and IgM (mixed conjugate) antibodies respectively, against β2-
Glycoprotein I in human serum. The wells of a microplate are coated with β2-
Glycoprotein I antigen. Antibodies specific to β2- Glycoprotein I present in the
patient sample bind to the antigen. Unbound fractions are washed off in the washing
step. In the next step, anti-human immunoglobulins conjugated with horseradish
peroxidase (conjugate) are incubated and react with the antigen-antibody complex of
the samples in the microplates. Unbound conjugate is washed off in the washing step.
Addition of TBM-substrate generates an enzymatic colorimetric blue reaction, which
is stopped by diluted acid (color changes to yellow). The rate of color formation from
the chromogen is a function of the amount of conjugate bound to the antigen-antibody

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three different samples (high, medium, near the cut-off) were assayed 18
times on three microplates of the specific antibody isotype, for two days for
the inter-assay study. Three different samples (high, medium, near the cut-off)
were assayed 24 times on one microplate of the specific antibody type for the
intra-assay study. Both studies were performed on Protocol 30-15-15
incubation time. Target values for the studies were set at %CV ≤ 10.
The inter-assay %CV range for AESKULISA® β2- Glyco-A was from 8.4%
to 9.6%, for AESKULISA® β2- Glyco-GM was 4.4% to 6.5% and for
AESKULISA® β2- Glyco-Check was 8.7% to 9.6%.
The intra-assay %CV range for AESKULISA® β2- Glyco-A was from 7.6%
to 8.7%, for AESKULISA® β2- Glyco-GM was from 5.1% to 8.8% and for
AESKULISA® β2- Glyco-Check was 7.3% to 8.4%. All the ranges were
within the target values.

Glycoprotein I IgA antibodies, two samples known to contain different levels
of β2- Glycoprotein I IgG/M antibodies and two samples known to contain
different levels of β2- Glycoprotein I Ig A/G/M antibodies were chosen and
serially diluted to determine the linearity of the assay. From an initial dilution
of 1/100, further dilutions of 1:200, 1:400 and 1:800 were made. The
AESKULISA® β2- Glyco-A assay had a recovery range of 93.9% to 107.0%.
AESKULISA® β2- Glyco-GM assay had a recovery range of 94.0% to
103.9%. AESKULISA® β2- Glyco-Check assay had a recovery range of
90.1% to 106.4% (see tables below).

prepared in-house and assigned arbitrary units (U/ml) during the development
process. The positive, cut-off, and negative controls are also prepared in-
house.
d. Detection limit:
The sample buffer was tested 30 times for each assay and result in an
analytical sensitivity of 1.0 U/mL. The value for the analytical sensitivity
(detection limit) was calculated as the mean of the optical densities of the
sample diluent.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference by endogenous substances: No data provided. The package insert
states that icteric, lipemic, hemolyzed or bacterially contaminated samples
should not be used in these assays.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off value for AESKULISA® β2- Glyco-A, AESKULISA® β2-
Glyco-GM and AESKULISA® β2- Glyco-Check were determined in serum
from 70 healthy donors. As a result, 15 U/mL has been defined as the cut-off
value (Mean value +3SD).
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
One hundred and fifteen (115) sera including 104 samples from patients
diagnosed with APS, SLE and other autoimmune diseases (samples were from
Germany); and 11 healthy donors were tested on the AESKULISA® β2-
Glyco-A, AESKULISA® β2- Glyco-GM and AESKULISA® β2- Glyco-
