The VITROS Chemistry Products BENZ assay is intended for use by professional
laboratory personnel. It provides only a preliminary test result. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used to confirm a result obtained with this
assay. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred
confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
applied to any drug-of-abuse test result, particularly when evaluating a
preliminary positive result.

I. Device Description:
The VITROS BENZ Reagent is a dual-chambered package containing ready-to-use
liquid reagents that are used to detect benzodiazepines in urine. Sample, calibrators,
and controls are automatically treated with surfactant (DAT Diluent 2) prior to
addition of reagents. Treated sample is added to Reagent 1 containing antibody
reactive to diazepam, glucose-6-phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD+), followed by Reagent 2 containing diazepam labeled with the enzyme
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH).
VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 26 is prepared from human urine to
which drugs of abuse, metabolites of drugs of abuse, organic salts, surfactants and
preservative have been added.
VITROS Chemistry Products FS Calibrator 1 is prepared from sodium chloride and
processed water. These products are used to calibrate VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry
Systems for the qualitative and semi-quantitative measurement of cocaine.
VITROS DAT Performance Verifiers I, II, III, IV & V are prepared from a human
urine pool to which analytes, surfactant and preservative have been added. These are
assayed controls used to monitor performance of the VITROS COCM Reagent on
VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems.
The product labeling for the Calibrator Kit 26 and Performance Verifiers contain
warnings regarding the presence of human sourced materials and recommend the use

VITROS Chemistry Products FS Diluent Pack 4 (DAT Diluent/DAT Diluent 2) on
VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems.
The assay is based on competition between benzodiazepines in the treated urine
sample and diazepam labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6P-DH) for antibody binding sites. Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the
antibody, therefore the concentration of benzodiazepines in the urine sample is
directly proportional to measured enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts oxidized
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to NADH, resulting in an absorbance
change that is measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Imprecision was evaluated with human urine based quality control materials
on the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System following CLSI Protocol EP5 and
CLSI protocol EP12.

one analyzer and four calibrations.
Qualitative imprecision was assessed using test fluids targeted at ± 25% of
each cutoff.

DAT Performance Verifiers I, II, III, IV, and V. This experiment was
performed three times, once with each of three VITROS BENZ Reagent lots
on the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System. A linear regression was performed
and the results indicated acceptable linearity across the range of 33 to 869
ng/mL. This linearity determination in conjunction with determination of the
limit of quantitation was used to establish the reportable range of the VITROS
BENZ assay to be 85 to 800 ng/mL.
Analytical Recovery of Semi-Quantitative Results
Eight admixtures were prepared from two human urine pools. The BENZ
values for the admixtures were verified by GC/MS. Percent recovery was
calculated using the concentration obtained by the VITROS Chemistry
Products BENZ Assay versus the GC/MS value.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The assigned values for the calibrators and controls are traceable to the
Cerilliant lormetazepam standard catalogue L-910 and are verified by GC/MS.
Real time and accelerated stability studies were conducted; protocols and
acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. These studies
support the manufacturer’s stability claims. Real time studies are ongoing.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit was determined according to protocol recommendations in
CLSI EP-17 on three different lots of reagent and one instrument platform.
The claimed lower limit for VITROS BENZ is 85 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The specificity of the VITROS BENZ assay for various benzodiazepines and
structurally similar compounds was estimated by generating a dose response
curve for each of the compounds listed below. The quantity (ng/mL) of
compound that produces a value equivalent to the lormetazepam quantity
(ng/mL) at each cutoff value is listed below. The combined effects of more
than one compound detected in a sample may cause levels lower than those
listed below to produce a value approximately equivalent to or greater than the
cutoff value.

A total of 115 human urine samples were assayed using the VITROS
Chemistry Products BENZ Reagent and a commercially available
immunoassay method, for benzodiazepine. Percent agreement was evaluated
at assay cutoff values of 200 ng/mL and 300 ng/mL.
To challenge performance at the 200 ng/mL cutoff value, 44 of the 115
samples tested had concentrations within +/- 50% of the cutoff value, 27
samples below the cutoff value and 17 above the cutoff value.
To challenge performance at the 300 ng/mL cutoff value, 39 of the 115
samples tested had concentrations within +/- 50% of the cutoff value, 30
samples below the cutoff value and 9 above the cutoff value.
