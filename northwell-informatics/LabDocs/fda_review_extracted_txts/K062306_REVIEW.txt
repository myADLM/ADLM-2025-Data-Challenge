H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
PlasmaCon N is a human lyophilized plasma control intended for use as a normal
control with citrated plasma to monitor the performance of the Prothrombin Time
(PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) tests.

level abnormal control with citrated plasma to monitor the performance of the
Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) tests.
PlasmaCon L-2 is a human lyophilized plasma control intended for use as a high
level abnormal control with citrated plasma to monitor the performance of the
Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) tests.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
4. Special instrument requirements:
I. Device Description:
The PlasmaCon Control Plasma devices contain lyophilized citrated human plasma
for use in the verification of system performance for PT and aPTT assays. The
PlasmaCon Control plasmas are packages in 10 vials each containing 1 ml of reagent.
Controls plasmas should only be used in an appropriate clinical laboratory by
qualified laboratory professionals. The tests may be performed manually or using
semi-automated and automated coagulation analyzers.
PlasmaCon N is prepared from a pool of fresh citrated plasma from donors with
normal coagulation parameters. The pooled plasma is buffered with Hepes and
lyophilized to maximize stability of all plasma constituents.
PlasmaCon L-1 and PlasmaCon L-2 are prepared from a pool of fresh citrated plasma
from donors with normal coagulation parameters. The pooled plasma is depleted of
clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. The control plasma is buffered with Hepes and
lyophilized to maximize stability of all plasma constituents.

citrated plasma sample. Tests may be performed manually or using semi-automated

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Data was collected for within run and between run precision using three levels
of lyophilized controls according to procedures developed under CLSI EP15-
A approved guidelines. Within run and between run precision studies
obtained CV values of less than 15%.
For within run, 10 vials of each sample were pooled, tested in duplicate and
recorded in duplicate or triplicate.
For between run, 2 vials of each sample were pooled, tested in duplicate and
recorded each day for 5 days.
In comparison studies, normal and abnormal control plasma controls were
tested using PT and aPTT reagents from multiple manufacturers on multiple
instrument types to include:
• r2 Diagnostics Phospholin ES on the ACL3000+, MLA1000c and ACL
Advance
• r2 Diagnostics Phosphoplastin RL on the ACL3000+, MLA1000c and ACL
Advance
• Dade Behring Thromborel S on the Dade BCS
• Dade Behring Pathromtin SL on the Dade BCS
• Diagnostica Stago Neoplastine CI+ on the Stago STA
• Diagnostica Stago Auto PTT on the Stago STA
The %CV ranges for all instrument and reagent combinations are:
Control Within run PT Between run PT Within run Between run

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The value assignment protocol was determined by testing the PlasmaCon N
reagent, the ACL3000+, and the Phosphoplastin RL (PT) reagent and
Phospholin ES (APTT) reagent in the prothrombin time (PT) and activated
partial thromboplastin time (APTT) assays. Ranges were determined based
on a 97.5% confidence interval; thus 3SD ranges around the mean were
calculated. The manufacturer recommends that each laboratory establish the
mean values and expected control ranges for their particular laboratory’s
instrument-reagent system.
Open vial and closed vial real time stability tests were performed. Results are
determined by pass/fail criteria.
Open vial stability studies were conducted PlasmaCon N, PlasmaCon L-1 and
PlasmaCon L-2. Seven vials of test control plasma was stored at room
temperature was run at the following intervals: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 hours (or
until three consecutive failed tests) in a PT and APTT assay.
Closed vial stability studies were conducted PlasmaCon N, PlasmaCon L-1
and PlasmaCon L-2. One vial of test control plasma was stored at 2-8° C was
run monthly for 3 months, once on months 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 (or until
three consecutive failed tests) in a PT and APTT assay. Data was provided
through month 7.
