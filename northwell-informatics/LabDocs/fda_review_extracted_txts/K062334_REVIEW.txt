temperatures. Master Pool values are verified by comparing against previously
approved Master Pool values. The stock solution is made by adding alcohol,
ammonia and carbon dioxide reference materials gravimetrically to stock
solution at target concentrations. The stock solution values are verified on an
instrument calibrated with a previously approved Master Pool. The
commercial lot is made by adding calculated quantities of stock solution to
purified water in appropriate concentrations for each of the calibrator levels.
The concentration of each level is verified by using an instrument calibrated
with Master Pools. The final bottle values for each level of the commercial
lot is assigned using multiple instruments by testing N = 45 replicates per
level.
Stability:
Target shelf life for the Dimension Vista™ System Chemistry 3 Calibrator is
12 months. Calibrator shelf life is determined by comparing results of the
product stored at 4°C with control stored at -20°C. The method is calibrated
from this stored material. The 4°C material values are recovered versus the
calibration. Recovery versus time is monitored and percent change over time
is determined. Percent change should be less than or equal to 5%. Shelf-life
stability (expiration) dating assignment at commercialization reflects the real-
time data on file at Dade Behring, Inc. A vial punctured by the instrument and
stored on board is stable for 24 hours. An open vial not on instrument, but
recapped and stored in a refrigerator is stable for 30 days.
For testing, vials are opened /punctured on day zero. A quantity sufficient
for multiple calibrations is removed and the vials are recapped and stored at
2 – 8 °C. Opened/punctured vials are tested on days 1, 3, and 32 versus
freshly opened vials.
