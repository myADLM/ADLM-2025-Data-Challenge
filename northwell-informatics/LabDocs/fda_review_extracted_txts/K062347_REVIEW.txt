Ascencia BREEZE Blood Glucose Meter
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
k024062
3. Comparison with predicate:
Changes to the test system include:
Meter: appearance, battery type, increased memory, decreased sample read time (30
seconds to 7 seconds)
Test Strips: decreased sample volume (2.5 uL to 1 uL), changes in the chemical
composition (more enzyme and substrate) polymer support matrix, and modification to
the autocalibration feature
Controls: slightly different glucose concentrations and different pH
Range: claimed range is 20 – 600 mg/dL
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
The manufacturer of the Bayer Ascensia BREEZE 2 System utilized ISO 15197-2003 “In
vitro diagnostic test systems – requirements for blood glucose systems”, and CLSI EP-7A
(Interference).
L. Test Principle:
The BREEZE 2 blood glucose test is based on measurement of electrical current caused
by the reaction of glucose with the reagents on the electrode of the test strip. The blood
sample is drawn into the end of the test strip through capillary action. Glucose in the
sample reacts with glucose oxidase and potassium ferricyanide, generating a current that
is proportional to the glucose concentration in the sample. The result is shown on the
meter display.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Initially, the sponsor established the equivalence of BREEZE and BREEZE 2 meters by
comparing performance characteristics of the original BREEZE meter (k024062) and the
proposed BREEZE2 meters (k062347). Previously cleared 30-second AUTODISC test strips
were used in these studies. The sponsor then established the performance characteristics of
the BREEZE 2 System (the combination of the new meter and the new BREEZE 2 test
strips). Results of these two sets of studies are shown below:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within day precision of the BREEZE 2 meter was established by testing spiked or
glycolyzed venous blood samples with AUTODISC test strips across the claimed
system test range, 20 – 600 mg/dL. Each sample was tested three times on eight
separate meters (n = 24). The same samples were run concurrently on YSI and the
predicate BREEZE meter. Results of the BREEZE 2/AUTODISC testing are shown
in the table below:
BREEZE 2/AUTODISC Within-day Precision
YSI (mg/dL) Mean BREEZE 2 Std Dev CV Meter to
Value (mg/dL) meter bias

536 551 12.4 2.3 % -0.8 %
662 692 21.4 3.1 % 0.8 %
Between day precision was assessed by testing 16 BREEZE 2 meters over 10 days;
each day low, normal and high BREEZE 2 control solutions were tested once on each
meter (n = 160 per level). Results are shown in the table below:

High 315 7.0 2.2 %
The within-day precision of the BREEZE 2 meter system (BREEZE 2 meter and
BREEZE 2 strips) was assessed in a laboratory study that used pooled venous blood
samples spiked at five different glucose concentrations. For each blood sample, 100
glucose readings were taken (10 readings each on 10 meters). The following table
summarizes the average and pooled within-meter percent coefficient of variation
(%CV) at each level:

Between day precision of the BREEZE 2 meter system was assessed by testing three
strip lots on 16 BREEZE 2 meters over 10 days; each day each lot of strips was tested
once per meter with low, normal and high BREEZE 2 control solutions (n = 160 per
level per lot). Results are shown in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A laboratory study tested the linearity of the BREEZE 2 meter using the AUTODISC: see the
precision section above for sample and testing description. Regression analysis showed a
linear relationship between BREEZE 2/AUTODISC and the YSI method (y = 1.024x +
1.25, R2 = 0.999) and between the BREEZE 2/AUTODISC and the predicate BREEZE
meter/AUTODISC (y = 0.997x – 2.684, R2 = 0.999).
Linearity of the BREEZE 2 system was established by testing three lots of BREEZE 2 test
strips with spiked or glycolyzed venous blood samples across the claimed system test range,
20 – 600 mg/dL. Each sample was tested ten times on five separate meters (n = 50, 250 total
samples). The same samples were tested in duplicate with YSI; the average was considered
the YSI value. Regression analysis showed a linear relationship between BREEZE 2
system and the YSI method for each lot:
Test Strip Slope R2
Lot #
A y = 1.013x -0.859 0.999
C y = 1.009x - 1.016 0.999
E y = 0.986x + 2.915 0.999
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability: Accelerated stability data testing suggests that the BREEZE 2 test strip and
control solutions have an 18 month shelf life. Real-time stability studies are ongoing.
Each level of Ascensia BREEZE 2 control is prepared gravimetrically and compared

method.
d. Detection limit:
The performance of the test system at the low end of the measuring rang (20 mg/dL)
was demonstrated as part of the linearity study. The operating range of the meter is 20
– 600 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Potential endogenous and exogenous interferents of the Ascencia BREEZE 2 system
were tested in a dose-response manner following CLSI EP7-A guidelines. Aliquots of
the blood were supplemented with glucose to a final concentration of 100 mg/dL and
measured on a YSI analyzer. Interferents were prepared with an appropriate solvent,
and spiked into the 100 mg/dL blood. A control pool was prepared by supplementing
the blood with solvent minus the interferent. A series of four to five levels that
included the maximum concentration of the substance that would be expected to be
encountered in clinical practice were used for each substance. The interferent effect
was calculated from the linear relationship between the tested concentrations of each
substance.
Albumin, cholesterol, galactose, glipizide, glucosamine, maltose, maltotriose,
maltotetraose, metformin, salicylate, triglycerides, and xylose showed no significant
bias (< ±10%) at any concentration tested. The table below shows the effect of the
common interferents that biased the results of the BREEZE 2 system. Shown is the
calculated amount of interference at the upper end of normal or therapeutic levels:

Hematocrit
The effect of sample hemoglobin variation on the BREEZE 2 system was tested
experimentally by collecting fresh capillary samples from 50 diabetic donors; samples
were tested on the BREEZE 2 system and by YSI as the reference method.
Hematocrit was also determined. Glucose levels of the samples ranged from 67 to 635
mg/dL; hematocrit levels ranged from 30 to 55%. Percent assay bias (from YSI) was
determined as a function of the hematocrit; the system was determined to have an
average 0.72% change in the reported glucose value for every percent deviation in the
sample hematocrit from 40%. For example, samples with a 20% hematocrit are
calculated to have a + 13% bias while samples with a 55% hematocrit are calculated
to have a – 12% bias.
Temperature
Temperature studies for the Ascencia BREEZE 2 Blood Glucose Monitoring System
demonstrate that the instrument performs acceptably over the allowable operating
range of the meter (10°C to 45°C or 50°F to 113°F).
High-Altitude
A simulated high-altitude study was conducted in a hypoxic chamber to simulate high
altitude effects on the Ascencia BREEZE 2 system. Two lots of Ascencia BREEZE 2
reagents were used for the simulated altitude study. The altitude study results indicate
the Ascencia BREEZE 2 system showed no evidence to suggest a systematic effect
due to lack of atmospheric oxygen at 13,500 feet.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The performance of BREEZE and BREEZE 2 meters were compared by testing
clinical samples on the original BREEZE meter and the proposed BREEZE2 meters;
previously cleared 30-second AUTODISC test strips were used in these studies.
BREEZE 2 with AUTODISC test strips (30 second read):
An accuracy study compared the BREEZE 2 system to the YSI method using fresh
fingerstick blood samples from people with diabetes. Two separate lots of test strips
with different program numbers were utilized in the investigation. 109 people and 11
contrived samples were tested in duplicate (n = 240) on the BREEZE 2, BREEZE,
and YSI. Glucose levels ranged from 15 - 533 mg/dL and hematocrits ranged from
28-51%. Linear regression analysis of the data yielded the results below:
Lot 1 vs. YSI y = 1.00x + 3.7 R2 = 0.983
Lot 2 vs. YSI y = 1.01x + 3.2 R2 = 0.989
BREEZE vs. BREEZE 2 y = 0.97x – 2.1 R2 = 0.976
6

--- Page 7 ---
BREEZE 2 with BREEZE 2 strips (7 second read):
The BREEZE 2 system was evaluated at two clinical sites; a total of 201 subjects
with diabetes and 8 healthcare providers (HCP) completed the study. Subjects
performed two fingersticks and tests; HCPs performed two tests on the subject in
parallel. Capillary blood was also collected for evaluation by YSI and for hematocrit.
Subjects ranged in age, education, and were about equally divided between males and
females; the majority of the participants had Type II diabetes. Three lots of strips
were tested at each site. At Site 1 105 participants participated in and completed the
study (n = 210 readings). Glucose concentrations ranged from 55.9 to 342.0 mg/dL
and hematocrit ranged from 22.5 to 54.5%. At Site 2, 96 participants completed the
study but four subjects were deleted from the analysis because of protocol deviations;
therefore 92 participants yielded a total of 184 readings. Glucose concentrations
ranged from 61.3 to 303.5 mg/dL and hematocrit ranged from 33.5 to 52.8%.

In an in-house clinical study, 100 fingerstick samples from people with diabetes were
read in duplicate over two weeks. Duplicate YSI values were obtained from each
participant; the average was taken as the YSI value. Samples ranged from 52 – 466
mg/dL; contrived samples were used to extend the tested sample range to 18 – 554
mg/dL. Hematocrits ranged from 28-51%. One strip lot was used. Linear regression
analysis of the data yielded the following relationship: y = 1.001x – 0.99, R2 = 0.987
Alternate Site Testing with the BREEZE 2 System:
The performance of the BREEZE 2 system for testing glucose values from alternate
sites was assessed in an in-house study of 60 subjects (57 diabetics, 3 non-diabetics).
Participants were predominately female, Caucasian, and Type 2 diabetics; age varied.
Subjects claimed to be in a glucose steady state having not eaten, taken diabetes
medication, or exercised vigorously for two hours prior to the study; steady state was
not confirmed independently. The median fingertip BREEZE 2 blood glucose result
for the 60 study subjects was 120 mg/dL, with results ranging from 65.5 to 323.5

mg/dL. The median hematocrit of the subject blood samples was 40% with results
ranging from 33.5 to 49.5%.
The BREEZE 2 alternate site claim is limited to the palm and forearm. Therefore
study participants performed tests in duplicate on these sites and on the fingertip (n =
6 per subject). A phlebotomist performed separate punctures for the fingerstick,
forearm, and two sites on the palm (n = 8 per subject) and collected capillary blood to
determine hematocrit. Not all sampling attempts were successful so the total number
of samples available for analysis is 222 samples from the palm and 213 from the
forearm. Values obtained from the alternate site testing were compared to fingerstick
results; linear regression analysis yielded the following results:

Yes __X______ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
The Ascencia® BREEZE® 2 Blood Glucose Monitoring System memory will store 420
results.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Refer to the Ascencia® BREEZE® 2 Blood Glucose Monitoring System User’s Manual.
5. Calibration:
The Ascensia® BREEZE®2 Blood Glucose Monitoring System, like its predecessors
Ascensia® DEX® and Ascensia® BREEZE® meters, uses an automatic calibration system
to calibrate the meter for each lot of test strips. The test strips are tested at the
manufacturer at the time they are released. Based on performance characteristics for each
lot of strips they are assigned a program number from 1 to 73. These program numbers
represent the slope and intercept characteristics for each of the lots. The program number
is then embedded in a digital label that is applied to the top of each 10-strip reagent disc.
When the customer puts the reagent disc into the meter, the meter reads the label and the
program number is automatically placed in the meter memory and used for that disc
6. Quality Control:
Three Ascencia BREEZE 2 Controls Solutions are available: low, normal, and high that
correspond to whole blood glucose concentrations of approximately 50, 100, and 270
mg/dL respectively. A control test, using an Ascencia® BREEZE® 2 Control, can be
used to check the meter and test strips performance. The meter test strips and testing
technique are acceptable if the control test result falls within a specific control range.
Users are instructed to follow the illustrated directions in the BREEZE® 2 User Guide.
Quality control testing should be performed as required by the user’s institution’s quality
control policy or local regulatory requirements.
