L. Test Principle:
The Innovacon hCG Ultra Test device employs a combination of gold-conjugated
monoclonal antibody and polyclonal solid phase antibody to selectively identify hCG
in serum and urine. Users are instructed to transfer 3 drops of urine or serum to the
specimen well. Mouse monoclonal antibodies (specific for the beta subunit of hCG
and labeled with colloidal gold particle) found in the conjugated pad dissolve and
migrate with the urine. If hCG is present in the urine, it binds to the mouse

monoclonal antibody. This complex is captured by the goat anti-hCG alpha subunit
polyclonal antibody embedded at the test line. When a sufficient number of
complexes have been captured at the test line, a pink to red-colored line becomes
visible.
Any mouse monoclonal antibody not bound to hCG will continue past the test line
and will be captured by goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibodies found at the control
region of the device. A colored line in the control region of the device indicates
adequate sample volume and capillary action. Absence of a colored line in the control
region is an indication of an invalid result. Users are instructed to read the device at 3
minutes (for urine) or 5 minutes (for serum).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
See “Detection limit” below.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Male urine pools were spiked with hCG to concentrations ranging from 500 –
1,000,000 mIU/mL to determine if there was a decrease in signal with
increasing analyte concentration. Urine results were read at 3 and 10 minutes;
serum results were read at 5 and 10 minutes. All specimens obtained the
expected result.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Innovacon hCG Ultra Test device is standardized against the World
Health Organization (W.H.O.) 4th International Standard for chorionic
gonadotropin 75/589.
d. Detection limit:
To assess the reproducibility and detection limit of the assay, the sponsor
spiked hCG into serum and urine samples from known non-pregnant
participants. Trained technicians at four Physician’s Office and Laboratory
(POL) sites performed the testing over three days with devices from three
different lots. The results are as follows:
Serum:

In addition to establishing the cut-off value for the device, analysis of the
study results showed there is no significant difference in the results obtained
at the four different sites.
e. Analytical specificity:
The device was tested and found to be non-reactive to negative serum and
urine specimens spiked with Luteinizing Hormone (hLH at 300mIU/mL),
Follicle Simulating Hormone (hFSH at 1000 mIU/mL) and Thyroid
Stimulating Hormone (hTSH at 1000 mIU/mL). Similarly, none of the hCG
positive urine and serum samples spiked with LH, FSH and TSH at the
concentrations above yielded a negative result at read times.
Commonly found substances (prescription, OTC, chemical and
biological analytes) were spiked into a male serum pool (containing 0 and 10
mIU/mL hCG) and a male urine pool (containing 0 and 20 mIU/mL hCG).
Samples were tested in triplicate. Urine samples were read as positive or
negative at 3 and 10 minutes. Serum samples were read at 5 and 10 minutes.
The presence of these substances did not affect the test results.
In addition, the sponsor investigated the effect of urinary pH (ranging from
pH 4.0 - 9.0) and urine specific gravity (ranging from 1.003 – 1.036) on the
performance of this device. There was no variation from the expected results.
f. Assay cut-off:
The sponsor claims a cutoff of 10 mIU/mL hCG for serum and 20 mIU/mL
hCG for urine.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The proposed device was compared to the predicate device and the results are
shown in the chart below. The clinical urine and serum samples were
collected from New York Biologics Inc. The assays were in agreement on
100 out of the 100 samples for both specimen types. There was no information
regarding clinical follow-up of the donors. Summary results were as follows:
