L. Test Principle:
The Wako LBA DCP assay uses a liquid-phase binding method. DCP in the sample
reacts with the anion-conjugated anti-Prothrombin mAb (Fab’) and the POD-labeled
anti-DCP mAb (Fab’) to form an immune complex. The reaction mixture is
introduced into an anion-exchange column. The immune complex fractions are
eluted into a reaction cup. The HRP activity is measured and is determined as the
increase of fluorescence intensity of 5,5’-diacetoamide-2-2’-bisphenol formed by the
reaction of H O and the substrate, 4-acetoamidophenol.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated according to CLSI EP5-A. Different concentrations
of DCP were spiked into 10 aliquots of normal pooled serum. The DCP
concentrations ranged from 1.0 to 481.8 ng/mL. These samples were assayed
21 times for the within-run precision study. The %CV was from 1.1% to
6.0%. The %CV for samples around the cut-off (i.e. 5.8-8.6 ng/mL) ranged
from 2.4 to 3.0% (see results below).

Accuracy
For this study, different concentrations of DCP were spiked into aliquots of 5
serum pools with known endogenous DCP concentrations. For aliquots
derived from serum pools 1 to 3, the spiked-in DCP concentrations were 4.5,
9.4, 19.5, 28.8 and 48.5 ng/mL. The % recovery for this group of samples
ranged from 93.3% to 111.1%. For aliquots derived from serum pools 4 and
5, the spiked-in DCP concentrations were 83.1, 193.2 and 346.3 ng/mL. The
% recovery for these samples ranged from 93.1% to 106.2%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The assay reportable range is 0 ng/mL to 500 ng/mL. For the linearity study,
four samples were prepared by adding measured amounts of DCP to pooled
normal serum. The DCP concentrations were 7.0, 39.3, 207.2 and 970.5
ng/mL. Five serially diluted samples were generated from each of the 4
spiked samples. The middle concentration preparation of each dilution series
was selected as the concentration value of the preparation and % recovery of
the other samples calculated against this value. The following table
summarizes the results.

High dose hook effect
A pooled normal serum was spiked with purified DCP to achieve a
concentration of 19,000 ng/mL. This sample was sequentially diluted and
each dilution was assayed in triplicate. No high dose hook effect was
observed.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no reference standard for DCP. The Wako 1st DCP standard was
prepared by in-house purification and its protein concentration was
determined by the BCA (bicinchoninic acid) method. For each lot of new
calibrator, values are assigned using the Wako 1st DCP standard. For new lots
of controls, the assigned values are determined by measuring the control with
Wako LBA DCP and DCP calibrators with DCP values traceable to the
standard.
Stability claims
Assay kit – 12 months at 2-10°C
Calibrator Set – 6 months at 2-10°C
Control Set - 2-10°C
After reconstitution:
Substrate solution – 2 weeks at 2-10°C
Open-vial stability:
Antibody – 10 operation days at 2-15°C
Substrate solution – 10 operation days at 2-15°C
*operation days means that open reagent vials were set on the instrument for 8
hours and re-capped vials were stored in a refrigerator (2-10°C) for 16 hours.
Sample stability
The sponsor provided a table for recovery of 10 samples with DCP
concentration ranged from 0.3 ng/mL to 13.7 ng/mL that were stored for 4
years at -80°C by comparing DCP concentration at 0 year. The percent
recovery ranged from 89% to 111%.

were subjected to 5 freeze-thaw cycles and percent recovery was determined
after each cycle. Results showed % recovery ranged from 85% to 104% after
5 cycles.
d. Detection limit/analytical sensitivity:
The detection limit was determined by measuring an analyte-free sample 21
times and estimated from the mean and two standard deviations (SD) of the
replicates. The mean value was 0.04 ng/mL (ranged from 0 to 0.1 ng/mL)
with a SD of 0.05 ng/mL. The detection limit claimed is 0.14 ng/mL.
Functional sensitivity
The study was performed according to CLSI Guideline EP17-A. For limit of
blank (L0B), serum samples from 4 healthy subjects were used. For each
sample, 15 replicates were measured. Since the distribution was not Gaussian,
LoB was determined by calculating the 95th percentile of the distribution using
the equation LoB = Pct .
B 100-α
For limit of detection (LoD), 4 samples were prepared from serum from a
healthy subject by spiking with DCP to a concentration approximately 4 x
LoB. For each of these samples, 15 replicates were measured. LoB and LoD
were determined to be 0.1 ng/mL and 0.24 ng/mL respectively.
e. Analytical specificity:
For the interference study, maximum concentration of each interferents was
then spiked into an aliquot of a DCP-spiked pooled normal serum (Serum A)
to generate Serum B. For each interferent, Serum A and Serum B were mixed
in various proportions to prepare 4 or 5 samples with a constant DCP
concentration but different interferent concentrations. Results of % recovery
ranged from 91% to 103% which met the acceptance criterion of 85-115%.

recovery for the Type 1 sample ranged from 93.8% to 100% and for the Type
2, 87.5% to 109.1%.
Cross-reactivity
Serum samples from 157 patients with other GI and non-GI cancers were
tested. Of the 68 patients with non-HCC GI cancers (gastric, rectal, renal
cellular), 4 had elevated DCP results. Of the remaining 89 non-GI cancer
patients, only one patient with prostate cancer and one with breast cancer had
elevated DCP results. There was a case report of a lung cancer patient with
positive DCP result.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off is 7.5 ng/mL. The cut-off was established using 54 newly
diagnosed HCC patients and 440 patients with either liver cirrhosis or chronic
hepatitis. ROC analysis was performed to identify a cut-off value that would
best distinguish HCC from no HCC with a specificity of about 90%. For the
selected cut-off value of 7.5 ng/mL, the sensitivity was 44.4% and specificity
88.9%.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
There is no predicate device for this analyte.
b. Matrix comparison:
Serum is the only sample type used.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Sponsor claimed clinical sensitivity 48.7%.
b. Clinical specificity:
Sponsor claimed clinical sensitivity 88.1%.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The intent of the clinical trial was to determine the usefulness of DCP values
in predicting the development of HCC with ≤ 21 months in enrolled subjects
with chronic hepatitis B or C and/or liver cirrhosis. The subjects were
monitored for the duration of the study (approximately 4 years) or until death,
or development of verifiable HCC. The study objective was to observe a
minimum of 30 subjects who did not have HCC at enrollment and developed
HCC during the study. The study also planned to enroll a minimum of 50
subjects who had HCC with < 5 cm tumors at enrollment. During the study,
blood samples were obtained every 3 months whenever possible and subjects
underwent investigator assigned imaging (CT, MRI or ultrasound) per study
site’s standard schedule and method. All blood samples for DCP were frozen
and shipped to Wako for analysis. The study was “double-blinded”.
Four hundred ninety-four (494) subjects were recruited from 7 clinical sites
(Lahey, MCV, Miami, Mt. Sinai, Toronto, UCSF and U Penn). The cohort
consisted of 324 males (73.5%) with an average age of 51.8 years and 117
females (26.5%) with an average age of 54.8 years. Clinical data were
collected for serum chemistries, imaging (CT, MRI and/or ultrasound),

presenting symptoms, medications/interventions/therapeutics, and other
medical information. Subjects were initially enrolled into two categories:
those with newly diagnosed HCC at the study onset and those that did not
have HCC. At the end of the study, all evaluable subjects were subdivided
into 4 categories by the site investigators based on biopsy, explanted liver
histology, imaging interpretation of tumor load, etc.: HCC at study onset
(Group 1), developed confirmed HCC during study (Group 2), suspected of
possible HCC (Group 3) and no HCC (Group 4). Only subjects that had 21
months between the first DCP positive result and end of study were included
which resulted in excluding 53 subjects from the 04 group. The final number
of subjects was 441.

Relative risk was calculated using group 2 and 4. The following table
summarizes the distribution of patients with DCP ≥7.5 ng/mL and those with
DCP <7.5 ng/mL in these groups.
HCC No HCC Total
DCP ≥7.5 ng/mL 19 33 52
<7.5 ng/mL 20 244 264
Total 39 277 316
Risk of HCC for DCP positive = 36.5% (95%CI: 23.5, 49.6)
Risk of HCC for DCP negative = 7.6% (95%CI: 4.4, 10.8)
Relative risk = 4.8 (95%CI: 2.8, 8.4)
Logistic regression analysis was performed using HCC variable (yes or no)
for the dependent variable and adding a “Time” covariate as the number of
days between the first DCP elevation of ≥7.5 ng/mL and the confirmed
diagnosis of HCC for Group 2 and the number of days between study
enrollment and the end of study for Group 4. The analysis showed that the
best fit for the model was when “Time” variable is linear and had no
significant interaction with DCP values and resulted in adjusted odds ratio of
5.6 (95%CI: 2.6, 11.8) as compared with unadjusted odds ratio of 7.0 (95%
CI: 3.4, 14.5).
4. Clinical cut-off:
Same as the assay cut-off.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Distribution of DCP values in patients with chronic hepatits B and/or C, cirrhosis
caused by HBV and/or HCV and HCC was determined from the clinical study.
Results are summarized below.
Number of Patient DCP (ng/mL)
Total DCP >7.5 ng/mL Median Range
Chronic hepatitis HBV 8 0 1.0 1.0-1.1
HCV 58 3 1.0 1.0-374.8
HBV+HCV 11 0 1.0 1.0-1.3
Cirrhosis HBV 23 3 1.0 1.0-106.6
HCV 218 17 1.0 1.0-38.8
HBV+HCV 83 15 1.0 1.0-176.2
HCC 54 24 7.5
Distribution of DCP values in 157 patients with other GI and non-GI cancers was
also evaluated. Of the 68 patients with non-HCC GI cancers, 4 had elevated
DCP. The total incidence in GI cancers was 5.9%. Of the remaining 89 patients,
only one patient with prostate cancer and one with breast cancer had elevated
DCP results. The total incidence in non-GI cancers was 2.3%. The following
table shows the summary results.

Based on literature, there was one case report of a DCP producing lung cancer in
addition to 6 case reports for DCP-producing gastric cancers. Since elevated DCP
could be found in other cancers, the sponsor includes in the “Limitation” section
of the package insert the following: “DCP producing tumors other than HCC can
show elevated values of DCP. It is recommended that this assay be used in
conjunction with imaging studies for clinical diagnosis”.
In normal subjects, DCP is not detectable but can be found in patients who are
vitamin K deficient or taking vitamin K antagonists such as Warfarin. In
“Precaution” section of the P.I., the sponsor stated that “Medication containing
vitamin K preparations may cause a negative bias on the DCP values. Medication
containing vitamin K antagonist or antibiotic may cause a positive bias on the
DCP values”.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
