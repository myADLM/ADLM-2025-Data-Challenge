510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
k062377
B. Purpose for Submission:
Software allowing data transfer from a cell phone to a central server for viewing.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
MedApps, Inc., MedApps Remote Patient Monitoring System
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
This device does not directly test glucose. This is an accessory to previously a
cleared glucose monitor (k024194/k043197).
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The MedApps Remote Patient Monitoring System (“System”) is designed to be
used by patients to send their data from the LifeScan OneTouch Ultra glucose
meter to a central server for subsequent storage and display.
The System is comprised of a “Hub” (cell phone software) and the MedApps
Engine, which runs on a central server.
The Hub is a software program that runs on a cell phone and takes in data from
the OneTouch Ultra (sent via the Polytel device (k070559)) and then transmits it
to the central server for storage and processing.
2. Principles of Operation:
The MedApps Engine is a software program that runs on a common Web /
Internet secure server platform. The MedApps Engine picks up the stored data
sent to it by the Hub and through a set of business rules set by the healthcare
providers, determines if a follow-up Interactive Voice Response (IVR) call is
required to be made to the patient to collect additional Behavioral information
from the patient.
Once all the data is collected, then it is stored in a repository for access by the
healthcare provider.
The Hub will utilize the OneTouch Ultra integrated Short-range low power
wireless transmission (Bluetooth V1.2) or a FDA approved accessory to the
medical devices that to transmits the medical device data via Bluetooth to a
compatible cellular telephone, such as the Nokia 6620, or other /compatible
cellular phones.

G. Intended Use:
1. Indication(s) for Use:
The MedApps Remote Patient Monitoring System model d-PAL acts as an
accessory to FDA cleared devices, which collects and transmits stored patient data
via wireless connections from medical devices to a cellular phone (Hub) and
forwards to a central server for review of historical data about a patient over time
to benefit the Healthcare Practitioner.
The following medical devices and measuring systems are fully validated for this
intended use at this time:
• LifeScan OneTouch ® Ultra® Blood Glucose Monitoring System
(k024194/k043197)
• Polytel PWR-08-03 Remote Module (k070559)

requirements to ensure that they were met. Data transfer was tested by
transferring sets of data from the transmitter (phone) to the database and
checking that the data was downloaded in its entirety, and that the data points
(results) that were transferred from the phone to the database matched the
original data taken from the phone. Data transmitted from the glucose meter
to the phone was validated in k070559.
