H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use.
2. Indication(s) for use:
VITROS Chemistry Products OP Reagent: For in vitro diagnostic use only.
VITROS Chemistry Products OP Reagent is used on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry
Systems for the semi-quantitative or qualitative determination of opiates (OP) in
human urine using a cutoff of either 300 ng/mL or 2000 ng/mL. Measurements
obtained with the VITROS OP method are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
opiate use or overdose.
The VITROS Chemistry Products OP assay is intended for use by professional
laboratory personnel. It provides only a preliminary test result. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used to confirm a result with this assay. Gas
Chromatograpy/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory
method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to
any drug-of-abuse test result, particularly when evaluating a preliminary positive
result.
VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 26: For in vitro diagnostic use only.
VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 26 is used to calibrate VITROS 5,1
FS Chemistry Systems for the qualitative or semi-quantitative measurement of
drugs of abuse.
VITROS Chemistry Products DAT Performance Verifiers I, II, III, IV & V: For in
vitro diagnostic use only. VITROS Chemistry Products DAT Performance
Verifiers are assayed controls used to monitor performance of urine drugs of
abuse screening assays on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems.

Nicotinamide adenine nucleotide (NAD). The other ingredients in Reagent 1 include
inorganic salt, organic salt, proteins, inorganic polymer, protease inhibitor, stabilizer,
surfactant and preservative. The reactive ingredients in Reagent 2 include morphine
labeled with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The other ingredients in Reagent 2
include buffers, organic salt, inorganic salt, proteins, inorganic polymer, protease
inhibitor, biological material, surfactant and preservatives.
VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 26 is prepared from human urine to
which drugs of abuse, metabolites of drugs of abuse, organic salts, surfactants and
preservative have been added.
VITROS DAT Performance Verifiers I, II, III, IV & V are prepared from a human
urine pool to which analytes, surfactant and preservative have been added. These are
assayed controls used to monitor performance of the VITROS PCP Reagent on
VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems.
The product labeling for Calibrator Kit 26 and Performance Verifiers contain
warnings regarding the presence of human source materials and recommend the use
of Universal Precautions when handling these products.

L. Test Principle:
The VITROS OP assay is a homogenous immunoassay based on the competition
between morphine in the treated urine sample and morphine labeled with the enzyme
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH) for antibody binding sites. Enzyme
activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, therefore the concentration of
morphine in the urine sample is directly proportional to measured enzyme activity.
Active enzyme converts oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to
NADH, resulting in an absorbance change that is measured spectrophotometrically.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated with quality control materials on the VITROS 5,1 FS
Chemistry System following CLSI EP5-A. The samples were run in

Qualitative imprecision was assessed using drug-spiked human urine pools with concentrations
targeted at approximately ± 25% of the 300 and 2000 ng/mL cutoff concentrations. The
concentrations of the targeted test fluids were confirmed by GC/MS. The sponsor performed
two runs per day with two replicates per run for 22 days using a single lot of reagent on one
analyzer. The results are presented below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor followed CLSI EP6-A in determining the linear range of their
device.
Number of reagent lots: 3
Replicates of each solution: 3
OP-LO (300 ng/mL)
Two urine pools were prepared with a high urine based morphine pool (4000
ng/mL) and a negative urine based pool (0 ng/mL). The two pools were mixed
to give 16 admixtures of intermediate concentrations. Linearity was evaluated
using three assay reagent lots and comparing the measured results against the
expected results from 16 pooled samples. A linear regression was performed
and the results indicated acceptable linearity across the concentration range
tested (69 to 1009 ng/mL). The claimed reportable range of the VITROS OP-
LO assay is 100 - 900 ng/mL.
OP-HI (2000 ng/mL)
Two urine pools were prepared with a high urine based morphine pool
(5000 ng/mL) and a negative urine based pool (0 ng/mL). The two pools
were mixed to give 11 admixtures of intermediate concentrations. Linearity
was evaluated using three assay reagent lots and comparing the measured
results against the expected results from 11 pooled samples. A linear
regression was performed and the results indicated acceptable linearity
across the concentration range tested (503 to 4000 ng/mL). The claimed
reportable range of the VITROS OP-HI assay is 700 - 4000 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The assigned values for the calibrators are traceable to the Cerilliant morphine
standard catalogue M-109 and are verified by GC/MS.
The assigned values for the controls are traceable to USP 14447002
(Morphine Monohydrate CII). They are prepared through gravimetric addition
to drug free urine and verified by GC/MS.
Real time and accelerated stability studies were conducted; protocols and

The sponsor determined that a high specific gravity does not interfere with the
assay by evaluating the primary causes of high specific gravity: high
concentrations of NaCl, protein, and glucose in urine.
The specificity of VITROS OP assay for morphine and structurally similar
compounds was determined by generating a dose response curve for each of
the compounds and determining the approximate quantity of each compound
that is equivalent in assay reactivity to the 300 ng/mL and 2000 ng/mL

The sponsor notes that the primary form of morphine in urine is morphine-3-glucuronide,
a morphine conjugate. The VITROS Chemistry Product OP Assay has lower recovery
with morphine conjugates than with free morphine. As part of sample preparation for
GC/MS analysis, morphine conjugates are commonly hydrolyzed to morphine. This may
lead to an apparent under-recovery of opiates when comparing VITROS OP Assay results
to GC/MS.
OPI-LO 300 ng/mL cutoff
One hundred and twenty one human urine samples were assayed on the device and were
compared to results from the predicate device.
