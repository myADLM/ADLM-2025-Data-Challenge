L. Test Principle:
The assay is based upon microparticle enzyme immunosaay technology (MEIA).
When human HoloTC antigen is present in the sample; it binds to the coated
microparticles, forming antigen-antibody complexes on the microparticles. An
enzymatic reaction yields a fluorescent product which is measured by the analyzer.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were done according the National Committee for Clinical
Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) Protocol EP5-A2. This study assessed
repeatability (within-run precision), reproducibility (total precision based on
between-day, between run, within-day and between instrument precision).
Precision of the system was demonstrated by assaying the low and high kit
controls for the AxSYM HoloTC assay. Assays were run twice daily for 20
days (leaving at least 2 hours between assay runs) on each of two AxSYM
instruments. In the event of a lost day, additional day(s) were added to the
study in order to generate 20 days worth of complete data.
A calibration curve was generated on each AxSYM during Run 1 on Day 1,

Precision (both reproducibility and repeatability) met the sponsors established
criteria specification of ≤ 10% CV.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reported or measurable range of the AxSYM HoloTC assay was defined
by the analytical sensitivity and the highest calibrator concentration. The
sponsor claims an analytical sensitivity of ≤ 1 pmol/L and a high calibrator
concentration of 128pmol/L.
Dilution linearity within the working range of the assay was demonstrated to
meet all criteria for linearity (acceptable range is 80% to 120%). Recovery test
of HoloTC spiked serum samples was demonstrated to be within acceptance
criteria of 80% to 120%. Dilution of three commercially available pools of a
high HoloTC sample into six dilutions showed correlation coefficients of:
pool 1 = R2 = 0.9747 y = 1.0507 + 1.0222; pool 2 = R2 = 0.978 y = 0.9613 x +
6.1325; and pool 3 = R2 = 0.9948 y = 1.0345x – 0.3515. The above least
square regression plot results for diluted AxSYM HoloTC samples
demonstrated linearity over the range 19.8 – 103pmol/L.

HoloTC calibrators are prepared gravimetrically from a stock solution of
recombinant HoloTC. The purity of the recombinant HoloTC is determined (i)
by SDS electrophoresis and (ii) spectroscopically from the ratio between the
protein component and the cobalamin component.
HoloTC Controls are prepared from human serum and assigned values with
reference to the HoloTC calibrators.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor claims an analytical sensitivity of ≤ 1pmol/L. The sponsor
defined the analytical sensitivity of the AxSYM HoloTC assay as the
concentration at two standard deviations above the AxSYM HoloTC Standard
Calibrator A (0.0pmol/L) and represents the lowest concentration of HoloTC
that can be distinguished from zero. In a representative study, the analytical
sensitivity was evaluated by repeated testing (n=12 runs in replicates of 10
across two reagent lots) of the AxSYM HoloTC Standard Calibrator A. In this
study, the mean analytical sensitivity was calculated as 0.08pmol/L. (observed
range 0.03 to 0.14pmol/L).
e. Analytical specificity:
Serum samples were spiked with potentially interfering substances and tested
in the HoloTC assay. the interference was ≤ 10% for all the following:

study where cross-reactivity with B binding proteins transcobalamin and
12
haptocorrin were measured by the assay. 500pmol/L transcobalamin was
added to line diluent and 5000pmol/L haptocorrin was added to Calibrator A
and then assayed. (n = 5 replicates) Data from this study are summarized in
