4. Panel: 83 Microbiology
H. Intended Use:
The LIAISON® Borrelia burgdorferi assay uses chemiluminescent immunoassay
(CLIA) technology on the LIAISON® Analyzer (Model 15970) for the qualitative
presumptive detection of IgG and IgM antibodies to VlsE (variable major protein-
like sequence, expressed) protein antigen of Borrelia burgdorferi in human
serum. This assay should be used only on samples from patients with signs and
1

symptoms that are consistent with Lyme disease. Positive or equivocal results
should be supplemented by testing with a standardized Western blot procedure.
Positive supplemental results provide evidence of exposure to Borrelia
burgdorferi and can be used to support a clinical diagnosis of Lyme disease.
Negative results by LIAISON® Borrelia burgdorferi Assay should not be used to
exclude Lyme disease.
Controls
The LIAISON® Borrelia burgdorferi Serum Controls (negative, positive) are used
to monitor the performance of the LIAISON® Borrelia burgdorferi
chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) for the qualitative determination of
IgG/IgM antibodies to B. burgdorferi in human serum. The performance of the
LIAISON® Borrelia burgdorferi Serum Controls has not been established with
any other Lyme disease assay.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The LIAISON® Borrelia burgdorferi assay uses chemiluminescent immunoassay
(CLIA) technology on the LIAISON® Analyzer for the qualitative presumptive
detection of IgG and IgM antibodies to VlsE (variable major protein-like
sequence, expressed) protein antigen of Borrelia burgdorferi in human serum.
This assay should be used only on samples from patients with signs and
symptoms that are consistent with Lyme disease. Positive or equivocal results
should be supplemented by testing with a standardized Western blot procedure.
Positive supplemental results provide evidence of exposure to Borrelia
burgdorferi and can be used to support a clinical diagnosis of Lyme disease.
Negative results by LIAISON® Borrelia burgdorferi should not be used to
exclude Lyme disease.
Controls
The LIAISON® Borrelia burgdorferi Serum Controls contains two assayed quality
control sera (negative and positive) that are used to monitor the performance of the
LIAISON® Borrelia burgdorferi assay.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
None
I. Device Description:
The method for qualitative determination of IgG and IgM to Borrelia burgdorferi is
an indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). All assay steps (with the
2

--- Page 3 ---
exception of magnetic particle resuspension) and incubations are performed by the
LIAISON® Analyzer. The principal components of the test are magnetic particles
(solid phase) coated with recombinant Borrelia VlsE antigens and a conjugate reagent
containing two mouse monoclonal antibodies (anti-human IgG and anti-human IgM)
linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-antibody conjugate). During the first
incubation, anti-Borrelia antibodies present in calibrators, samples or controls bind to
the solid phase. During the second incubation, the antibody conjugates react with
anti-Borrelia IgG and IgM antibodies that have bound to the solid phase. After each
incubation, unbound material is removed with a wash cycle. Subsequently, the starter
reagents are added and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is thus induced. The light
signal, and hence the amount of isoluminol-antibody conjugate, is measured by a
photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is indicative of the presence of
Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies present in calibrators, samples or controls.
Controls Description:
Positive and negative serum controls are made from defibrinated human plasma.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Not applicable
L. Test Principle:
Chemiluminescent immunoassay
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Study 1: Assay precision performance was established at DiaSorin following a
protocol outlined in CLSI document, EP5-A2. Six (6) serum samples and one lot
of LIAISON® Borrelia Serum Controls (2) were tested in four replicates per day
over 20 working days on two LIAISON® instruments. The panel members were
selected to represent negative to high-positive analyte levels. The results
indicated a %CV of 8 to 14 for positive samples.
Study 2: An assay reproducibility study was conducted at two external US
laboratories and at DiaSorin using the same serum samples described above in a
five-day protocol outlined in CLSI document, EP15-A2. The samples were tested
at all three sites, in four replicates per day for five days. Each site used a different
LIAISON® Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM Assay lot. The results indicated a
%CV of 8 to 11 for positive samples.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Not applicable
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
The LIAISON® Borrelia burgdorferi assay was used to test samples from
apparently healthy adult blood donors collected in a region in which Lyme disease
is endemic (Pennsylvania) and in a region in which Lyme disease is rare
(Arizona).

Non-endemic 300 299 0 1 0.3%
Cross-reactivity: The cross-reactivity studies for the LIAISON® Borrelia
burgdorferi IgG/IgM Assay were done by testing closely related members of the
spirochete genera (T. pallidum), tick-borne diseases (Babesiosis, HGE, TBRF and
RMSF), organisms that may cause infectious disease, (CMV, EBV, HIV),
H.pylori, and other conditions that may result from atypical immune system
activity such as RF, RA, Autoimmune diseases, SLE, MS as well as HAMA and
anti-E.Coli. Eleven specimens out of 300 total specimens tested from the cross-
reaction panel were positive. Potential assay interference due to circulating
antibodies against Human Ehrlichiosis (HGE) and Tick Borne Relapsing Fever
(TBRF) has been detected.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Sixty (60) samples from an archived collection consisted of clinically-defined
(culture confirmed) Lyme disease patients were tested with the LIAISON®
Borrelia IgG/IgM Assay. These samples consisted of early, convalescent, and
neurologic stages.
Sensitivity: 73.3% (44/60)
Percent Agreement with predicate ELISA device
Positive 93.2% (41/44)
Negative 81.3% (13/16)
Overall 90.0% (54/60)
Vaccine Recipients: Eleven (11) frozen banked samples were tested from adults
treated with a licensed recombinant OspA vaccine (LYMErix™, manufactured by
GlaxoSmithKline Biologics). All samples were negative by the test indicating no
cross reactivity with the vaccine antigens.
CDC Serum Panel: A serum panel was obtained from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and tested by the LIAISON® Borrelia burgdorferi
IgG/IgM Assay. The panel consists of 5 normal sera and 37 sera with confirmed
Lyme disease and obtained at different times from onset of disease. It was
assayed using the test kit and the positive agreement was found to be 73% (27/37)
and the negative agreement to be 100% (5/5).

tested. LIAISON® Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM Assay showed 41 samples as
positive and 4 as equivocals.

Positive 70.0% (35/50)
Negative 99.1% (973/982)
Overall 97.1% (1008/1038)
The samples that were found to be positive or equivocal in the ELISA are tested
on a second step Western blot.
