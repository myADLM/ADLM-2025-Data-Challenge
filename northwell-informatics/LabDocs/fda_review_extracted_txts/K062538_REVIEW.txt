L. Test Principle:
The Test Principal of this device is based on amperometric technology using glucose
oxidase. When the blood sample is applied to the test strip, electrons are formed by
the reaction between glucose oxidase and blood glucose. The electrical current is
measured by the meter and correlates with the concentration of glucose in the blood
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Two different lots of EASY CHECK Blood Glucose Test Strips were tested to
assess the precision and repeatability of the EASY CHECK Blood Glucose
Monitoring System using venous whole blood concentrations between 30 and
335 mg/dL (spiked samples). Blood samples were collected from healthy
donors into tubes that contained heparin. Ten different meters were tested for
20 days with 2 runs per day. The coefficient of variation for one lot of the test
strips is shown below:
Precision table:
Level Mean SD (Within- SD (Between- % CV
(mg/dL) run) run)
1 32 2.7 1.5 6.4
2 49 2.8 1.4 6.8
3 71 2.8 2.0 5.3
4 113 2.7 2.6 4.4
5 216 5.6 1.9 3.8
6 335 7.1 4.2 3.7
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed using oxygenated venous blood
supplemented with 50% aqueous glucose solution to provide samples at
eleven different blood glucose levels (25-35 mg/dL, 40-60 mg/dL, 120-130
mg/dL, 180-190 mg/dL, 240-250 mg/dL, 300-320 mg/dL,370-390 mg/dL,
450-470 mg/dL, 520-540 mg/dL, 600-620 mg/dL, and 670-750 mg/dL). Two
glucose meters and two different lots of test strips were used and ran in
duplicate. YSI glucose analyzer as a standard reference instrument was used
for validation. The linear regression was as follows:
y = 1.0283x – 4.9201, r2 = 0.992.

6	335	7.1	4.2	3.7

--- Page 6 ---
The sponsor claimed that the linearity range of the EASY CHECK Blood
Glucose Monitoring System is 30 to 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no calibration required to perform the EASY CHECK Blood Glucose
Monitoring System test; however, a lot specific code card is provided with
each box of the EASY CHECK glucose test strips. Calibrations were done in-
house and parameters were coded into the code card. The user must check
and make sure that the code number printed on the code card matches the code
number on the test strip vial and that it also matches the code number in the
EASY CHECK glucose meter before testing.
The EASY CHECK Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to NIST
SRM 917b reference material.
The value assignment of the EASY CHECK Glucose Control Solutions was
determined by an in-house procedure. The range of the control solutions was
determined by running multiple runs of the control solutions on the EASY
CHECK glucose meters. For control solution level 1, range was set at mean ±
25% of the average value. For control solution level 2, range was set at mean
± 20% of the average value.
Accelerated stability and real time stability of the EASY CHECK Glucose
Control Solutions were performed to assess the shelf-life and open-vial
stability of the EASY CHECK glucose control solutions, respectively. The
sponsor claimed that the shelf-life of the EASY CHECK glucose control
6

--- Page 7 ---
solutions is 12 months when stored at 2-300C and the open-vial stability is 60
days after opening when stored at 2-300C.
EASY CHECK glucose test strips shelf-life is 18 months and open-vial
stability is 60 days after opening when stored at 2-300C.
d. Detection limit:
See Precision at 32 mg/dL and linearity/reportable range studies above.
e. Analytical specificity:
i.) An interference study was conducted to determine the effect of select
endogenous and exogenous substances. The following 7 exogenous and 3
endogenous substances were tested: acetaminophen, ascorbic acid, dopamine,
ibuprofen, L-Dopa, tetracycline, tolutamide, cholesterol, creatinine and uric
acid. Stock solutions of the above chemicals were prepared and spiked into
the tested pool sample with different concentrations. The % bias was
calculated based on the differences between the spiked sample and the control
pool sample. The sponsor claimed a bias of ≤ 16% for all the interferents
tested.
The sponsor claimed that the therapeutic levels of L-dopa or dopamine may
result in inaccurate glucose readings with the system. Interference was also
observed in samples with high ascorbic acid and uric acid. This information is
also provided in the limitation section of the package insert.
ii.) A hematocrit study was performed to evaluate the hematocrit variation
effect of the EASY CHECK Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Oxygenated
venous blood sample with 9 different Hct levels (20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 55, 60,
65, 70%) were prepared. Five different glucose concentrations of oxygenated
venous blood concentrations (30, 70, 150, 260, 600 mg/dL) were prepared.
The data showed that hematocrit levels outside of 30%-50% range may cause
inaccurate test results.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device and reference method:
Two hundred sixty people with diabetes performed a fingerstick test using the
EASY CHECK Blood Glucose System. A healthcare professional then
performed the test on the EASY CHECK Blood Glucose System, the Bayer
7

--- Page 8 ---
System (predicate device) and the YSI analyzer (reference method). The
range of glucose values for these samples was 30-505 mg/dL (YSI). The
linear regressions were as follows:
Patient’s results on EASY CHECK (Y) vs YSI (X):
Y = 0.9681X + 5.6043, r2 = 0.9734
Healthcare professional’s results on EASY CHECK (Y) vs YSI (X):
Y = 0.9643X + 5.7915, r2 = 0.9782
Based on the ISO Standard 15197 document, how well the EASY CHECK
Blood Glucose Monitoring System compared with the laboratory method was
shown in the table below:
For glucose results lower than 75 mg/dL, the percent (33/33) 100%
(and number) of meter results that match the laboratory
method within 15 mg/dL:
For glucose results at or higher than 75 mg/dL, the (215/227) 95%
percent (and number) of meter results that match the
laboratory method within 20%:
Note: When meter results are compared to the laboratory results, results
below 75 mg/dL are compared in mg/dL.
b. Matrix comparison:
Alternative testing sites : palm and forearm testing has been performed by the
patients and the healthcare professionals to show comparable performance at
times of steady state conditions with regard to accuracy at the finger site in
comparison to the YSI (reference method). The range of glucose values for
these samples was 30-525 mg/dL (by the finger). The linear regressions were
as follows:
Patient’s palm (Y) vs patient’s finger (X):
Y = 0.9921X + 5.371, r2 = 0.9784
Patient’s forearm (Y) vs patient’s finger (X):
Y = 0.9576X + 5.2861, r2 = 0.9697

[Table 1 on page 8]
For glucose results lower than 75 mg/dL, the percent
(and number) of meter results that match the laboratory
method within 15 mg/dL:	(33/33) 100%
For glucose results at or higher than 75 mg/dL, the
percent (and number) of meter results that match the
laboratory method within 20%:	(215/227) 95%

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Testing on Fingertips – Refer to the EASY CHECK Blood Glucose Monitoring
System User’s Guide for detailed meter information prior to testing. Items
needed: EASY CHECK Blood Glucose Meter, lancet, and EASY CHECK
Glucose Test Strips.
Testing on palm and forearms- The following important notes are listed in the
package insert:
• Consult your healthcare professional before you begin using the palm or
forearm for testing.
• Under certain conditions, blood glucose test results obtained using
samples taken from your palm or forearm may differ significantly from
fingertip samples. Do not use palm or forearm testing when your blood
glucose is changing rapidly such as following a meal, an insulin dose, or
associated with physical exercise.
5. Calibration:
Lot Specific adjusted calibration with pre-set test strip code number.
6. Quality Control:
Two levels of control solutions are provided by the sponsor.
To Run Glucose Control Solution Test:
The EASY CHECK Glucose Control Solutions are used as a quality control check
to make sure that the EASY CHECK Blood Glucose Meter and the EASY
CHECK Glucose Test Strips are working correctly. Each EASY CHECK Glucose
Control Solution is intended for use only with the EASY CHECK Glucose Test
Strips. A control solution test is performed the same way that a blood glucose test
is performed except control solution is used in place of a blood drop. The control
solution test confirms that the meter and test strips are working correctly. The
control solution test results should fall within the range of results printed on the
vial label of the control.
Each EASY CHECK Glucose Control Solution should produce results that fall
within the range of results printed on the vial label of the control being used. If
the control solution test result is outside the range (is either higher or lower), the
EASY CHECK Glucose Meter and test strip may not be working as a system.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
the “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
10

--- Page 11 ---
1. Humidity testing was performed and the sponsor claimed that the EASY
CHECK BGMS is not affected by humidity between 20% to 80%.
2. Glucose meter operating temperature was evaluated and the sponsor claimed
that the EASY CHECK BGMS can get the same acceptable reading from
100C to 400C.
3. Glucose meter storage temperature was evaluated and the sponsor claimed that
the EASY CHECK glucose meter can be stored between -200C to 500C.
