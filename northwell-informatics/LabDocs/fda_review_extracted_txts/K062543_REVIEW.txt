I. Device Description:
The Focus Diagnostics Plexus HerpeSelect®1 and 2 IgG uses an Antigen Bead suspension
that contains two distinct HSV antigen bead types that fluoresce at different wavelengths
and/or intensities: gG1 beads and gG2 beads.
The Focus Diagnostics Plexus HerpeSelect®1 and 2 IgG is a three step procedure.
1. Patient sera are diluted, and the diluted sera are incubated with Antigen Beads. If
HSV antibodies are present, then the antibodies bind to the corresponding antigen
beads.
2. Phycoerythrin⎯conjugated goat anti-human IgG, (Conjugate) is added, and the
Conjugate binds to the bound HSV antibody (if present), and forms a Conjugate-HSV
antibody-antigen bead sandwich.
3. Fluorescence from each distinct HSV antigen bead type is measured and compared
against a Cut-off Calibrator.

Inter-Lot Reproducibility
Focus assessed the device's Inter-lot Reproducibility by testing eleven samples
with three separate lots. The samples were run in triplicate. Each lot had a
different set of gG-I and gG2 beads, a different lot of conjugate (made from 2
different stock conjugates), and a different lot of calibrator (made from 2
different combinations of positive and negative sera). The results of the

i. Cross-reactivity
Cross-reactivity (n = 51)
Focus assessed cross-reactivity with two groups of samples: a "HSV
ELISA dual negative" group (n=37), and a "HSV ELISA mixed sero-
reactivity" group (n=14).
The HSV ELISA dual negative group (n=37) included samples that were
sero-negative with both the HerpeSelect-1 ELISA IgG and HerpeSelect
2 ELISA IgG, and were sero-positive by at least one of a FDA cleared
CMV ELISA IgG (n = 18), a home brerw VZV ACIF (n=32),
a FDA cleared EBV VCA IgG (n=31). The HerpeSelect 1 and 2 Plexus
IgG was HSV-1 negative with all but one of the HSV ELISA dual
negatives, and equivocal with one sample (the one sample was CMV+
VZV+ and EBV+). The HerpeSelect 1 and 2 Plexus IgG was HSV-2
negative with all but one of the HSV ELISA dual negatives, and
equivocal with one sample (the one sample was CMV- VZV+ and
EBV+).
The HSV ELISA mixed reactivity group (n=14) included samples that
were sero-positive with either the HerpeSelect-1 ELISA IgG or
HerpeSelect 2 ELISA IgG, and were sero-positive by at least one of a
FDA cleared CMV ELISA IgG (HSV-1 neg n = 2, HSV-2 neg n = 9), a
home brew VZV ACIF (HSV-1 neg n = 1, HSV-2 neg n = 2), a FDA
cleared EBV VCA IgG (HSV-1 neg n = 1, HSV-2 neg n = 0). The
HerpeSelect 1 and 2 Plexus IgG was HSV-1 negative with all of the
HSV-1 ELISA negatives in the mixed reactivity group.
The HerpeSelect 1 and 2 Plexus IgG was HSV-2 negative with all of the
HSV-2 ELISA negatives in the mixed reactivity group.

Focus (n = 150) and an external investigator (n = 150) assessed the device's reactivity
with sera from Expectant Mothers. The sera were sequentially submitted to the
laboratory, archived, and masked. The external investigator was an University laboratory
located in Northern California, and the sera were collected in the Pacific Northwestern
United States. The HerpeSelect Plexus results were compared to the HerpeSelect 1
ELISA IgG and the HerpeSelect 2 ELISA IgG, using the Focus HerpeSelect 1 and 2
Immunoblot IgG as the reference method.
HSV-1 Reactivity
The Focus HerpeSelect 1 Immunoblot IgG was: HSV-1 positive for 170 samples, HSV-1
negative with 128 samples, and HSV Common Antigen band positive for two samples.
The Plexus HerpeSelect 1 agreed with: 96.5% (164/170) of Immunoblot positives, and
92.2% (118/128) of Immunoblot negatives. The two Immunoblot HSV Common Antigen
band positives were both negative in the Plexus.
HSV-2 Reactivity
The Focus HerpeSelect 2 Immunoblot IgG was: HSV-2 positive for 122 samples, HSV-2
negative with 176 samples, and HSV Common Antigen band positive for two samples.
The Plexus HerpeSelect 2 agreed with: 94.3% (115/122) of Immunoblot positives, and
95.5% (168/176) of Immunoblot negatives. The two Immunoblot HSV Common Antigen
band positives were both negative in the Plexus.

Reactivity with Sexually Active Adults (n = 300)
Focus (n = 150) and an external investigator (n = 150) assessed the device's reactivity
with sera from sexually active adults. The sera were sequentially submitted to the
laboratory, archived, and masked. The external investigator was a clinical laboratory
located in Southern California, and the sera were collected in the Pacific Northwestern
United States. The HerpeSelect Plexus results were compared to the HerpeSelect 1
ELISA IgG and the HerpeSelect 2 ELISA IgG, using the Focus HerpeSelect 1 and 2
Immunoblot IgG as the reference method.
HSV-1 Reactivity
The Focus HerpeSelect 1 Immunoblot IgG was: HSV-1 positive for 157 samples, HSV-1
negative with 142 samples, and HSV Common Antigen band positive for one sample.
The Plexus HerpeSelect 1 agreed with: 91.0% (142/156) of Immunoblot positives (one
sample was not run on the Plexus device), and
96.5% (137/142) of Immunoblot negatives.

CDC Panel Reproducibility
All paired sera were correctly identified: The Focus Diagnostics HerpeSelect® 1 and 2
Plexus IgG identified 16 out of 16 paired HSV-1 positive and HSV-2 negative (100%), 7
out of 7 paired HSV-2 positive and HSV-1 negative (100%), 11 out of 11 paired double-
positive (100%) and 16 out of 16 paired double-negative (100%) samples.
Specificity with a Low Prevalence Population (n = 77)
Focus (n = 77) assessed the device's reactivity with sera from a low prevalence
population. Focus selected sera from patients aged 18 and 19 years, and that had been
submitted to a clinical laboratory in Southern California from states having a history of
low sexually transmitted disease prevalence. Focus excluded sera that were submitted for
sexually transmitted diseases, herpesvirus testing, and tests indicating the patient may be
immunocompromised. The sera were sequentially selected, archived and masked. The
HerpeSelect Plexus results were compared to the Focus HerpeSelect 1 and 2 Immunoblot
IgG.
HSV-1 Reactivity
The Focus HerpeSelect 1 Immunoblot IgG was: HSV-1 positive for 28 samples, HSV-1
negative with 47 samples, and HSV Common Antigen band positive for two samples.
The Plexus HerpeSelect 1 agreed with: 96.4% (27/28) of Immunoblot positives (one
HSV-1 Immunoblot positive was equivocal in the Plexus device), and 97.9% (46/47) of
Immunoblot negatives (one HSV-1 Immunoblot negative was positive in the Plexus
device). One Immunoblot HSV Common Antigen band positive was equivocal in the
Plexus, and the other sample was Plexus negative.
HSV-2 Reactivity
The Focus HerpeSelect 2 Immunoblot IgG was: HSV-2 positive for four samples, HSV-2
negative with 71 samples, and HSV Common Antigen band positive for two samples.
The Plexus HerpeSelect 2 agreed with: 75.0% (3/4) of Immunoblot positives (one HSV-
1 Immunoblot positive was equivocal in the Plexus device), and 100% (71/71) of
Immunoblot negatives (one HSV-1 Immunoblot negative was positive in the Plexus
device). Both Immunoblot HSV Common Antigen band positives were negative in the
Plexus.

EXPECTED VALUES
An outside investigator assessed the device with masked, archived and unselected sera
from 1) sexually active adults (n = 300), and 2) from expectant mothers (n = 300). The
reference methods were Focus Diagnostics HerpeSelect 1 ELISA IgG and HerpeSelect 2
ELISA IgG. The observed prevalences and the hypothetical predictive values for the two
populations are shown below. The positive predictive value will decrease proportionally
to the prevalence of HSV infection as reflected in the table below. The calculations are
based on HerpeSelect 1 and 2 Plexus IgG having
1) HSV-1 sensitivity of 96.5% and a HSV-1 specificity of 92.2% (expectant mothers),
and
2) HSV-2 sensitivity of 94.3% and a HSV-2 specificity of 95.5% (expectant mothers).
3) HSV-1 sensitivity of 91.0% and a HSV-1 specificity of 96.5% (Sexually Active
Adults), and
4) HSV-2 sensitivity of 96.3% and a HSV-2 specificity of 97.4% (Sexually Active
Adults).
