K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Not applicable.
L. Test Principle:
1. The sample is applied to the chromatography paper via the circular sample port
(Sample).
2. The sample is absorbed through the pad to the reaction zone containing colloidal,
gold-labeled antibodies specific to Shiga toxins.
3. Any Shiga toxin (ST1 and ST2) antigen present complexes with the gold-labeled
antibody and migrates through the pad until it encounters the binding zones in the
test (Toxin 1, Toxin 2) area.
4. The binding zones (Toxin 1 and Toxin 2) contain another anti-ST1 or -ST2
antibody, which immobilizes any Shiga toxin-antibody complex present. Due to
the gold labeling, a distinct red line is then formed.
5. The remainder of the sample continues to migrate to another binding reagent zone
within the control zone, and also forms a further distinct red line (positive
control). Regardless of whether any Shiga toxin is present or not, a distinct red
line should always be formed in the control zone and confirms that the test is
working correctly.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Assay precision, intra-assay variability and inter-assay variability were
assessed with a reference panel prepared from broths inoculated with ST1 and
ST2. Of the 11 samples in the reproducibility panel, 2 were prepared as high
positive (HP) samples, four as low positive (LP) samples near the assay limit
of detection, 4 as high negative (HN) samples just below the assay limit of
detection, and one as a low negative sample (LN). Each clinical site tested the
panel twice per day for three consecutive days. The expected results were
obtained at each test interval at each site resulting in an assay precision of
100% with no variability.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable – this is a qualitative test with no numerical output.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Not applicable

--- Page 6 ---
d. Detection limit:
Method: Diluted broth media was inoculated with defined quantities of Shiga
Toxin 1 (ST1) or Shiga Toxin 2 (ST2) toxin, then tested. Results and
Conclusions: The results given in Table 12-12 show the analytical sensitivity
of the assay is 1.25 ng of toxin per mL for both ST 1 and ST 2.

strains of E. coli, then tested. Results and Conclusions: The following 39
STEC stock cultures were cultivated in GN or MacConkey broth. O157:H7
(32 strains), O157:NM (1), O111:NM (2), O111:H21 (1), O121:H19 (1),

Cross reactivity:
Method: Stool broth cultures containing low levels of Toxin 1 or Toxin 2 were
spiked with bacterial, viral and yeast strains that might be expected to be present in
human stool samples either as part of normal flora or from a disease state (TEST).
The final concentration of bacteria or yeast in each sample was ≥ 7.5 x 107
organisms/mL. The final concentration of viruses in each sample was > 1.6 x 105

against which the reactions with spiked samples could be compared (CONTROL).
An organism that diminished a positive reaction by 4 or more grades, that caused a
positive to become negative, or that caused the appearance of a positive reaction in
a formerly negative sample was considered to be an interfering organism.
Results: None of the potential co-contaminants of stool samples affected positive
or negative test results. No crossreactivity has been observed with this assay for

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
See Clinical Studies
b. Matrix comparison:
The results of each broth method (Gram Negative (GN) or MacConkey (Mac)
broth) are compared to each other in following table.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
This study was conducted with samples tested fresh or following frozen

storage. Samples were obtained from patients in the United States, Canada
and Argentina. Five US laboratories evaluated 469 samples using Mac and
GN broths; 120 of the samples were solid stool specimens obtained from
patients assumed to have gastroenteritis. There were 448/469 samples which
produced growth in GN broth, while 449 produced growth in Mac broth.
Three of the GN broth samples were excluded from evaluation with the
comparative device due to insufficient volume. Seven of the 469 samples
grew in Mac broth only while another 3 samples grew in GN broth only and
14 failed to grow in either broth. Stool specimens were collected from male
and female patients of all ages. Samples producing discrepant results between
Premier EHEC and ICS EHEC were further analyzed using cytotoxin assay.
These samples generally produced weak reactions (<0.300) in Premier EHEC.
