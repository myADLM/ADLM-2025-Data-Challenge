K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
ISO 15197: In vitro diagnostic test systems - Requirements for blood-glucose monitoring
systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus
L. Test Principle:
Glucose measurement is based on electrical potential caused by the reaction of glucose with
the reagents contained on the strip’s electrodes. The glucose in the sample is oxidized by the
enzyme glucose oxidase, and the current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured
and converted to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is
proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated the precision of the device using replicate measurements of
glucose adjusted venous whole blood. Ten samples at 5 different concentrations were
tested on ten meters each tested with 3 strip lots. Results are summarized below.

A study with a range of 50 to 550 mg/dL was also performed. Glucose adjusted
whole blood samples were compared to YSI 2300. Linear regression yields the
following statistics:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The device is traceable to a laboratory analyzer which is calibrated to a glucose
standard (NIST SRM 965a).
Stability characteristics of the two control solutions were determined using real-time
stability studies to determine the storage stability at room temperature (24±3ºC) to be
18 months.
The expected values for the two glucose control solutions were established by repeat
testing (10 times) on ten meters using three lots of strips for both glucose levels. The
expected results may change with each new lot, but the control range is listed in the
product insert.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the eBsensor Blood Glucose Monitoring System is 30 - 600
mg/dL. This range was validated via the linearity study (above).

The sponsor tested the following substances for interference. The following results
were determined with regard to interfering substances:
Substance No Interference
Acetominophen < 1.25 mg/dL
L-Dopa < 1 mg/dL
Dopamine < 1 mg/dL
Methyl-Dopa < 3 mg/dL
Glibenclimide < 1 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid < 1.25 mg/dL
Creatinine < 1.25 mg/dL
Uric acid < 10 mg/dL
Bilirubin < 1.85 mg/dL
An altitude study was performed with 20 volunteers’ whole blood samples and 5
different concentrations of glucose spiked whole blood spanning 88 to 353 mg/dL.
The volunteers test results and the spiked whole blood samples were measured by the

eBsensor. The volunteer samples were compared to YSI and found to be acceptable
(within Zone A using EGA with a linear regression of y=0.9278x+8.3196 with an
r2=0.9618. With the spiked samples, a repeatability study was performed with a
single lot of strips and 10 different meters which showed a coefficient of variation
lower <5% for each concentration. The altitude study was performed at 10,744 feet;
however the sponsor will make the claim of no effect on blood glucose measurements
of up to 8000 feet.

2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ______
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, only.

batch. No further calibrations are required of the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor is providing a high and low glucose control solution with this device. When
a test strip is inserted into the meter, a control can be run. An acceptable range for each
control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is referred to the
troubleshooting section of the owner’s manual if control results fall outside these ranges.
