H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Status DS Nicotine
Immunoassay for the qualitative detection of cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, at
the cut-off of 500 ng/mL in human urine. Status DS Nicotine is used as an aid in
the detection of cotinine after use of tobacco products or other products
containing nicotine. For In Vitro Diagnostic Use.
The Status DS Nicotine test provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more
specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas chromatography, mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the
preferred confirmatory method.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle:
The device uses a solid phase chromatographic membrane immunoassay technology
and is based on the principle of specific immunochemical reactions between antigens
and antibodies. The test relies on antibody binding competition between cotinine
conjugate and the cotinine that may be present in the urine sample. In the test
procedure, a sample of urine is placed in the sample well of the device and allowed to
migrate up the membrane. If cotinine is present in the urine sample, it competes with
the cotinine conjugate, which is bound to the dye, for the limited antibodies
immobilized on the membrane. If the cotinine is present at or above the 500 ng/mL
cutoff, cotinine will saturate the antibodies, thus inhibiting the binding of the dye
coated with cotinine conjugate to the antibodies on the membrane. This prevents the
formation of a line the membrane. A cotinine-positive urine sample will not generate

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Qualitative imprecision was assessed by conducting a lot-to-lot precision
study. The samples were prepared by adding cotinine to a known amount
of drug-free specimen at concentrations 50% below the cutoff, 25% below
the cutoff, 25% above the cutoff, 50% above the cutoff and 100% above
the cutoff. The samples were tested with two lots of devices for two
consecutive days. 10 samples for each of the 6 concentrations were tested
daily for each lot.
The results are summarized in the table below:
Number of operators: 3
Number of lots: 2
Number of days: 2

Cotinine % Cutoff Number Tested Positive Negative

750 150% 120 117 3 98
1000 200% 120 120 0 100
A second qualitative imprecision study was conducted at three physician
office laboratories using 15 blinded, randomized control samples: 5
negative samples, 5 samples at 50% below the cutoff and 5 samples at
100% above the cutoff. One operator performed the test at each site. The
operators consisted of 2 nurses and one medical technician. There was
100% agreement at all concentration levels at all sites.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. The assay is intended for qualitative use.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device has internal process controls. A visible line appearing in the
control region confirms that sufficient sample volume has been applied. In
the labeling, users are instructed not to interpret the test if a visible line failed

External control materials are not supplied with this device. External controls
are available from commercial sources to ensure proper kit performance. In
the labeling the sponsor recommends that the user run controls at regular
intervals following federal, state and local guidelines.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were described for stability testing and
found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The claimed cutoff for this assay is 500 ng/mL. The precision studies (above)
demonstrate performance of the device around the cutoff. e. Analytical
specificity:
The analytical specificity studies were performed on compounds structurally
related to nicotine. All compounds were prepared in drug-free normal human
urine. The following compounds produce positive results when tested at
levels greater than the concentrations listed below.
Compound Concentration (ng/ml)
Cotinine 500
Niacinamide >100,000

(±)-Anabasin >100,000
(±)-Nornicotine >100,000

To evaluate the potential for interference by certain exogenous compounds,
urine samples with concentrations at ± 25% of the cutoff were spiked with
potential interferants and tested. No interferences were observed at the
concentrations tested. Results are summarized below:
