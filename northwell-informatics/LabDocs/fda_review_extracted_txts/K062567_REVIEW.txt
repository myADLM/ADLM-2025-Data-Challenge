L. Test Principle:
The glucose oxidase and potassium ferricyanide in the strip react with the glucose in the
sample to produce an electrical current which is proportional to the amount of glucose in the
sample. The meter measures the current and converts it to the corresponding glucose
concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-day precision:
Venous blood samples were allowed to glycolyze or were spiked to five
concentrations. Each sample was tested ten times by three different meters; one strip
lot was tested. Testing results are summarized in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the device was demonstrated by comparing 15 prepared whole blood
samples on the Rightest and a glucose reference method; each level was tested in
quadruplicate by two lots of test strips. The 15 samples covered the claimed clinical
of the meter. Analysis of the results showed a linear relationship between the Rightest
and the YSI method: Lot 1 y = 0.981x - 2.27, R2 = 0.999, Lot 2 y = 0.981x – 1.79, R2
= 0.999. The reportable range of the Rightest meter is 20 - 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The control materials supplied for this device were cleared under k012431. The
sponsor established traceability to a reference method in k042678.
d. Detection limit:
20 mg/dL: see linearity studies above. For values below 20 mg/dL the meter reads
‘LO”.
e. Analytical specificity:
The specificity of the device was established in k042678.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A consumer study was performed with 176 lay-users and a technician to see if
glucose readings from the forearm, palm and fingertip were comparable to a
laboratory glucose reference method. The subjects ranged in age, education, and were
about equally divided between males and females; the majority of the participants had
Type II diabetes. The study was performed in a clinic setting. Patients sampled all
three sites then the technician tested at all three sites and collected a venous blood
specimen for measurement on a YSI analyzer. Each participant performed their own
fingerstick and tested their blood using the instructions in the User’s Guide. Samples
ranged from 30 – 572 mg/dL. Linear regression analysis of the data yielded the
results below:

a. Clinical Sensitivity:
See method comparison section above.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The normal fasting adult glucose range for a non-diabetic is 70 – 105 mg/dL. One to two
hours after a meal, normal blood glucose levels should be less than 140 mg/dL. A
medical professional should determine the range that is appropriate for diabetes patients.
N. Instrument Name:
Bionime Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No ________ See k042678 for more information.
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm, or
forearm only. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are
no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
A Smart Code Key is provided with each batch of test strips to calibrate the meter for that
batch. No further calibrations are required of the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor is providing a high and low glucose control solution with this device. When
the Check Key is inserted into the meter, the control mode is activated. This prevents
control results from being stored in the internal memory. An acceptable range for each
control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is referred to the
troubleshooting section of the User’s Manual if control results fall outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the

Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
