This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific
alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical
result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)/ High performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC, for TCA) are the preferred confirmatory methods.
Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of
abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are obtained.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
Certain foods or medications containing opiates or opiate derivatives,
amphetamines, methamphetamine, barbiturate, benzodiazepines, or tricyclics may
produce a positive result in any chemical or immunological assay. Poppy seeds
can contain opiates or ingestion of products containing poppy seeds can cause a
positive result.
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use with the DXpress Reader or as a visually read test.
I. Device Description:
The AccuSign RC DOA 10 and the Status First DOA 10 are one-step immunoassays
that are sold in two packaging: 10 tests or 35 test kits. Each individual test contains
the test device, disposable sample dispenser and instructions for use booklet.

L. Test Principle:
The AccuSign RC•DOA10 test uses solid-phase chromatographic membrane
immunoassay technology for the qualitative, simultaneous detection of
methamphetamine, opiates, cocaine, THC, phencyclidine, benzodiazepines,
barbiturates, methadone, tricyclic antidepressants, and amphetamine in human urine.
The test relies on competitive binding of the antibodies between drug conjugate and
drug which may be present in the urine sample. A sample of urine is placed in the
sample well of the device and is allowed to migrate upward. If the drug is present in
the urine sample, it competes with the drug conjugate, which is bound to the dye, for
the limited antibodies immobilized on the membrane. If the drug or drug metabolite
levels are above the cutoff level, the drug will saturate the antibodies, thus inhibiting
the binding of the dye coated with drug conjugates to the antibodies on the
membrane. This prevents the formation of a line on the membrane. Therefore, a
preliminary drug-positive urine sample will not generate a line in the test window,
indicating a positive result from positive drug competition, while a negative urine
sample will generate a line in the test window, indicating a negative result from an
absence of competition with free drugs.
In addition to the Test line that may appear in the Test window (T), a Control line is
present in the Control window (C) which should always appear if sufficient sample
volume is used applied and the sample migrates correctly up the test strip membrane.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor conducted precision studies for each drug on the DOA 10 panel.
Spiked urine controls with concentrations of 0, 50% below cutoff, 25% below
cutoff, cutoff, +25% above cutoff, 50% above cutoff and 100% above cutoff
levels were tested. Ten devices at each concentration were tested on three
readers for two days with two lots of test devices by three operators (total 40
tests per level, per operator). The samples were aliquoted and randomly given
to operators for a blind study. The test result was visually read at 5 minutes
after adding urine sample and then immediately read with the DXpress reader.
There were no significant differences between readers, operators, between
days or between lots for the ten tests on the panel.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable for a qualitative assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device has internal process controls. A colored line appearing in the
control region confirms that sufficient sample volume was added and that the
sample migrated correctly up the test strip membrane.. Users are informed not
to interpret the test if a colored line failed to appear in the control region.
External controls are not supplied with this device. The sponsor recommends
the use of commercially available controls to be used with the DXpress
Reader. The DXpress reader will report “Control:Valid” and test result only if
the internal process controls are satisfied.
Stability testing of the test strips was previously reviewed under
k983501. To validate this claim using both the reader and strips visually read,
the sponsor performed additional stability studies. The results from these
studies showed expected results for all concentrations and support the sponsor
real time 15 month stability claim.
d. Detection limit:
A cutoff value validation study (see precision section above for a summary of
the data) was conducted at seven different drug concentrations to include 0,
+/- 50% of the cutoff, +/- 75% of the cutoff, the cutoff and +100% of the
cutoff. The samples used were GC/MS or HPLC confirmed. Three operators
were used to analyze two assay lots. The results demonstrate performance at
the sponsor’s chosen cutoffs of methamphetamine as 1000 ng/mL, opiates as
300 ng/mL, cocaine as 300 ng/mL, THC as 50 ng/mL, PCP as 25 ng/mL,
benzodiazepine as 300 ng/mL, barbiturate as 300 ng/mL, methadone as 300
ng/mL, TCA as 1000 ng/mL, amphetamine as 1000 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:

e.2. Interference
Each compound was added with the concentration given below to urine
samples which had 50% or 150 % cutoff concentration of each drug. Each
spiked urine sample was tested in triplicate. The result was interpreted as no
interference if 50 % cutoff level urine sample with spiked compound showed
negative result and 150% cutoff level urine sample with spiked compound
showed positive result. No interference was observed at the concentration
below.

Additionally, the sponsor tested many common substances and biological
materials (104) for cross-reactivity with the drug of abuse tests at a
concentration of 100 μg/mL in drug-free and drug positive urines. The
sponsor states that they was no cross-reactivity detected with the visual
tests. The compounds are listed in the package insert.
e.3 Urinary pH
The effect of urine sample pH on the assay result was examined. The pH
4.5 to pH 8.5 urine samples were tested with concentrations of 50% cutoff
level and 150% cutoff level for each drug. At each pH and each
concentration the test was repeated 10 times. There was no discrepancy
from expected in the results with different pHs and showed that there was
no interference from urine pH ranging from 3 to 9.
e.4. Specific gravity
The effect of specific gravity of urine samples on the test result was
examined. The urine samples with specific gravity 1.002 and 1.04 were
tested at 50% cutoff level and 150% cutoff levels for each drug. At each
specific gravity and each concentration the test was repeated ten times.
There was no discrepancy from expected in the results with different

f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed
cutoff concentration appears in the precision above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The performance of AccuSign® RC·DOA10 was evaluated in comparison to
the result of GC/MS (HPLC for TCA). Over 40 clinical samples which
contain drugs were tested and the results were compared to the GC/MS or
HPLC values. Additionally, the sponsor tested 100 drug negative samples
were collected from people who apparently were not taking the drug. All test
results were read visually and with the DXpress reader. There was no
significant difference between the reader and the visual test results. The table
below lists the compounds analyzed by GC/MS or HPLC and the results of
the method comparison study.
