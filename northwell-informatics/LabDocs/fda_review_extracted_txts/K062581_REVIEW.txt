L. Test Principle:
The Olympus TSH assay is a two-step paramagnetic particle enzyme immunoassay. It
is based on the sandwich principle and used to quantitate TSH in serum/plasma.
The Olympus TSH assay reagent and sample are added to the assay cuvette in the
following sequence:
1. Samples are incubated first with a monoclonal anti-TSH antibody bound to
paramagnetic particles.
2. After a washing step, a second monoclonal anti-TSH antibody conjugated with
alkaline phosphatase is added. The TSH reacts with the paramagnetic particles
and the conjugated antibody to form a sandwich complex. Washing steps
remove the unbound material.
3. The chemiluminescent substrate is added to the assay cuvette and reacts with
the bound alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Light generated by the reaction is
measured by the luminometer. The light emission is proportional to the quantity
of TSH in the sample.
4. Results are calculated from a pre-defined calibration curve. The Olympus
AU3000i system automatically calculates the TSH concentration of each sample
in mIU/L or μIU/mL.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was determined using pooled human sera according to CLSI
protocol EP5-A: 2 per day for 20 days (n=80).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Assay measuring range is approximately 0.001 – 130 mIU/L.
To assess performance of the device, four patient samples at various
concentrations were serially diluted with a prepared standard solution built
with an artificial matrix. The recovery of each sample was measured using the
Olympus TSH Assay. Precent recovery was calculated as follows:

Four human serum samples in the range of 0.459 to 134.835 mIU/L of TSH
were diluted and assayed. The recoveries ranged from 86.01 % to 104.57 %
with a mean of 93.68 %. Therefore, the Olympus TSH assay can recover
diluted analyte in serum within ± 10 % of the total mean.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The TSH calibrator is traceable to the WHO 3rd International Standard 81/565.
The calibration material is prepared by creating a master calibrator from the
reference material and bovine serum matrix in which the value assignment is
verified with 1 instrument, 3 runs, 6 replicates per run. Lot specific master
curve and calibrator value assignment are determined on 1 instrument, 3 runs,
15 replicates per run. Once open, the calibrator is stable at 2-8 ˚C for 28 days,
and unopened until the stated expiration date which is validated with ongoing
real time stability studies.
The TSH Control target concentration range is set at the euthroid/hyperthyroid
threshold. Value assignments are determined on 3 instruments, 3 runs, 3 days,
5 replicates per run. Once open, the control is stable at 2-8 ˚C for 28 days and
unopened until the stated expiration date which is validated with ongoing real
time stability studies.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical Sensitivity
The lowest detectable level on an Olympus AU3000i analyzer was calculated

Serum verses plasma study was carried out by collecting blood from at least
10 donors into various blood collection tubes and measuring the TSH
concentration in each. The blood collection tubes tested were serum, EDTA
plasma, and lithium heparin plasma.
The mean results from each tube were compared by using a paired t-test (95%
confidence interval) and % bias.
Collection Tubes T-Test Mean % Bias
Null
Hypothesis
Serum vs. Li-H Accepted N/A
Serum vs. EDTA Rejected -3.7%
The t-test showed no statistical difference between serum and lithium heparin
plasma. In accordance with the procedures no further analysis was necessary
and lithium heparin plasma was accepted as a suitable sample type.
The t-test showed a statistical difference between serum and EDTA plasma.
The sponsor determined that the mean % bias between these matrices (-3.7%)
was acceptable because it was lower that their predetermined total allowable
error for the TSH assay (24.6%).
