K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The EliA Celikey IgG wells are coated with human recombinant tTG. If present in the
patient’s specimen, antibodies to tTG will bind to their specific antigen in the wells.
After washing away non-bound antibodies, enzyme- labeled antibodies against human
IgG antibodies (EliA IgG conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate
complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away and the bound
complex is incubated with a development solution. After stopping the reaction, the
fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The higher the response value, the
more specific IgG is present in the specimen. To evaluate test results, the response for
patient samples is compared directly to the response for IgG calibrators.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
One negative and three positive samples were measured in duplicate on
one instrument in 26 runs on EliA Celikey IgG well batch together with
one set of system reagent. The studies yielded the following:

Linearity was not claimed for this device.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The IgG calibrators are traceable (via an unbroken chain of calibrations) to the
International Reference Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of Human Immunoglobulins
A, G, and M from WHO. New batches of calibrators are compared to a
secondary standard (standardized with the IRP) or the IRP directly and
adjusted accordingly to meet the correct concentration (6 levels).
d. Detection limit:
The lower limit of the measuring range was determined by measuring
dilutions (1:2, 1:4, and 1:8) of Calibrator 4 (4 µg/L) in the Calibrator Wells.
The results in Response Units (RU) were compared with the result of the
sample diluent on EliA Celikey Wells. The discrimination ability of the assay
should be >2. All samples were measured in triplicate.

The 1/8 diluted calibrator 4.0 (0.5 µg/L) still can be discriminated from
background given by the signal of the diluent on Celikey IgG wells. The lower
limit of detection was set at 0.5 µg/L corresponding to 0.6 EliA U/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering substance
The potential interferant and the corresponding blanks were added to two anti-
tTG positive sera from patients with Celiac disease. The spiked samples were
tested in triplicate.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical samples:
Two hundred forty-four patient samples were tested with the new device and
the predicate device, Celikey tTG IgG antibody assay. These samples included
93 patients with a diagnosis of Celiac disease. One hundred fifty one (151)
samples were from disease controls:
101 non-CD, normal biopsy
10 ulcerative colitis
10 morbus crohn
20 rheumatoid arthritis
10 rheumatoid factor positive samples
Equivocal results were excluded in the calculation. Results showed the

An extended correlation study including 74 more samples (45 samples with
celiac disease and 29 samples with suspected celiac) resulted in a positive
agreement of 92.4%. No other information was provided on these banked
samples. Equivocal results were excluded in the calculation. The new data is
