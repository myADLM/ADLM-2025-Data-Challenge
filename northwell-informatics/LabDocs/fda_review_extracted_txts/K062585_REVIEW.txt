I. Device Description:
The MicroScan® MICroSTREP plus® Panel is a 96-well plastic dish which contains
microdilutions of each antimicrobic in various concentrations dried in aqueous
solutions. The panel is rehydrated and inoculated at the same time with a Mueller-
Hinton broth supplemented with lysed horse blood (2 – 5%). The target inoculum
concentration for each well should be approximately 5 x 105 colony forming units
(CFU)/mL. Panels are incubated in a 35° C non-CO incubator for 20-24 hours. After
2
incubation, the panels are read manually for growth. Additionally, panels may be
incubated in and read by a MicroScan® WalkAway instrument. Each panel contains
a “growth” but it does not contain a “no growth” control well.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S16) “Methods
for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard.”
L. Test Principle:
The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are miniaturizations of the broth dilution
susceptibility test that have been diluted in water and dehydrated. Various
antimicrobial agents are diluted in water, buffer or minute concentrations of broth to
concentrations bridging the range of clinical interest. Panels are rehydrated with 115 µL
Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with 2-5% lysed horse blood (LHB), after
inoculation of the broth with a standardized suspension of the organism. The target
inoculum concentration for each well should be approximately 5 x 105 colony forming
units (CFU)/mL. After incubation in a non-CO incubator for 20-24 hours, the
2
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test organisms is determined by
observing the lowest antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth. Panels
can be read manually using indirect light or the panels can be read on the MicroScan®
WalkAway instrument using optics light detection.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
This submission is for the AST Panel only. The ID System was not reviewed.
The Reproducibility studies, QC performance data, and Challenge isolates evaluated
by the manual and automated reading methods are contained in this submission to
demonstrate that there is no difference between manual reading and automated reading
in the MicroScan® WalkAway System. The clinical efficacy performance was
previously established (K021169) using the manual read method and was therefore
not required for this submission.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates tested at 3 sites
on 3 separate days in triplicate. The study included testing on the
MicroScan® WalkAway System with automated reading at 20-24
hours, and manual readings at 20-24 hours incubation. Nine of the
ten reproducibility isolates produced off-scale results. Both reading
methods demonstrated >95% reproducibility, and no differences
were observed.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or method):
The recommended QC isolate S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 was
tested a sufficient number of times with acceptable results on all
testing days with the reference method. Quality control results
demonstrated the ability of the different reading parameters (manual
and instrument) to produce acceptable results. The following table
provides the frequency of results in each concentration with the
expected range stated. Both reading methods produced the same
mode.

Inoculum density control: A turbidity meter, which was verified
each day of testing, was used for the turbidity inoculation method.
Colony counts were performed weekly, on the ATCC S. pneumoniae
with all results in the expected range of approximately 5 x 105.
No trending was observed.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical efficacy testing with manual result reading was conducted in
the previous submission (K021169). In this submission, Challenge
isolates were evaluated by the manual and automated reading methods
to demonstrate that there is no difference between manual reading and
instrument reading on the MicroScan® WalkAway System. The dried
antimicrobial agent was tested in doubling dilutions ranging from 0.03
– 4 µg/ml. Data are presented and clearance is requested for 0.12 – 4
µg/ml. There were 70 challenge isolates from the CDC Challenge Set
tested at one site and compared to the reference broth dilution result.
A comparison was done with readings on the instrument after 20 hours
incubation, and also read manually when incubated for 20-24 hours.
Performance by the automated reading method was acceptable with no
differences or trends.
The recommended CLSI reference method was followed with the
exception of the use of a small amount (0.1%) of Pluronic (a wetting
agent) in the final inoculum. A validation of the use of Pluronic in the
frozen reference panel was conducted. QC was also performed with
no difference apparent in the results.

Essential agreement (EA) is when the Microscan® MICroSTREP
plus® panels agree with the reference test panel results exactly or
within one doubling dilution of the reference method. Evaluable
(Eval) are results that are within the test range and on scale.
Automated reading results were the same as the manual reading results
with no trending observed. There were no vmj or maj errors, and there
were no additional minor errors generated by the automated reading
method. The evaluable numbers for both the manual method and the

automated reading methods are very low, but there is no apparent
difference or trending in the reading methods. The overall EA% for
the manual read and overall EA% for the automated reading were both
very good.
The test device had a growth rate of >95% for both the manual reading
and the automated reading methods.
The comparison of the reading methods demonstrates that the manual
reading method and the automated reading on the MicroScan®
WalkAway System are no different. The efficacy data performed with
the manual reading method would therefore be expected to have no
differences.
The performance data currently documented in the package insert
will not change.
