I. Device Description:
Vision BioSystems PR 16 is a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the
progesterone receptor antigen located in the nuclear region of a variety of normal and
neoplastic tissues routinely processed and paraffin-embedded. PGR Clone 16 is
intended for use in standard immunohistochemical staining procedures to allow for
visualization of the targeted antigen by the sequential application of the
PGR Clone 16 primary antibody, visualization reagent, and chromogen, resulting in a
visible reaction at the antigen site. Results are evaluated using a light microscope.
The antibodies are available as ready-to-use, concentrated, lyophilized, a version
optimized for use with the Ventana Medical Systems Automated Stainers and a
version for use with Vision BioSystems Bond-max™ System.

L. Test Principle:
Vision BioSystems Progesterone Receptor (Clone 16), specifically binds to
progesterone receptor antigen located in the nuclear region of a variety of normal and
neoplastic tissues. Immunohistochemical staining is performed on routinely
processed, paraffin-embedded specimens allowing the qualitative identification by
light microscopy of the antigens. Prior to staining, endogenous peroxidase activity is
blocked and sections are subjected to epitope retrieval. The section is subsequently
incubated with the primary antibody. For the Novacastra ™ and Origin™ products, a

biotin-conjugated secondary antibody formulation that recognizes mouse
immunoglobulins is used to detect the primary antibody. A streptavidin- or ABC-
peroxidase conjugate is then applied and binds to the biotin present on the secondary
antibody. For the Bond™ product, a polymer refine detection system is used. This
system utilizes a controlled polymerization technology to prepare polymeric HRP-
linker antibody conjugates. Sections are then incubated with the substrate/chromogen,
3,3’- diaminobenzidine (DAB). Reaction with the peroxidase produces a visible
brown precipitate at the antigen site. Sections are counter stained with hematoxylin
and cover slipped. Results are interpreted using a light microscope

e. Analytical specificity:
Novacastra™ Mouse Monoclonal Antibodies and Origin™ Ready-To-Use
Primary Antibody: Specificity was evaluated on a range of normal tissues.
Characteristic staining was observed in the nuclei of cells that express high
levels of the protein: a proportion of endometrial, ovarian, and myometrial
cells, and normal breast ductal cells. Negative tissues included adrenal, bone
marrow, brain (cerebellum), brain (cerebrum), colon, esophagus, heart,
kidney, liver, lung, mesothelial cells, parathyroid, peripheral nerve,
salivary/submandibular gland, skeletal muscle, skin, small intestine, spleen,
spinal cord, stomach, testis, thymus, and thyroid. Weak staining was observed
in ovary stromal cells and occasional islet cells of the pancreas.

Bond™ Ready-To-Use Primary Antibody: An evaluation on a panel of
normal tissues was conducted using the Bond™ Ready-To-Use Clone 16
primary antibody in conjunction with Bond™ Refine Detection System on the
Vision BioSystems Bond-max™ slide staining system. A total of 85
formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues covering a wide range of
normal human tissue types were tested with the ER antibody. The antibody
demonstrated negative immunoreactivity with most tissues. Positive
immunoreactivity was noted with some normal tissues which are typically
positive, like uterus, ovary and ductal epithelial cells of the breast. Positive
staining was also observed in ovary stromal cells, islet cells of the pancreas,
the muscle layer of the small intestines and the capsular region of the testis.
f. Assay cut-off:
Slides are scored using the Quick Score System. The tumor is scored
according to the proportion on cell nuclei stained (1-5) and the intensity of the
staining (0-3). A score of 3 or over is classified as receptor positive.
