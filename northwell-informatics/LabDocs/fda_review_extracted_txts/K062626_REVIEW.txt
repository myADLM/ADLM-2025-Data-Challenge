L. Test Principle:
Solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the competition
principle. An unknown amount of antigen present in the sample and a fixed amount
of enzyme labeled antigen compete for the binding sites of the antibodies coated onto
the wells. After incubation the wells are washed to stop the competition reaction.
After the substrate reaction the intensity of the developed color is inversely
proportional to the amount of the antigen in the sample. Results of samples can be
determined directly using the standard curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra assay precision for saliva was determined by repeated measurements of
control saliva samples within the same run. The mean CV was 5.7% (range
3.2 – 7.6%). Inter assay precision for saliva was determined by repeated
double measurements of control saliva samples in 10 different runs on
consecutive days. The mean CV was 7.4% (range 6.2 – 9.1%).
Intra assay variation for serum was determined by repeated measurements of
samples after 1:51 dilution with standard A. The mean CV was 8.8% (range
3.8 – 11.8%). Inter assay variation for serum was determined by repeated
double measurements of control sera samples after 1:51 dilution in 10
different runs. The mean CV was 11.2% (range 10.8 – 12.0%).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Reportable range:
Saliva: 0.015 – 4 µg/dL Cortisol (anal.Sens. to highest standard- higher
samples must be diluted to give results within the standard curve)
Serum: 0.75 – 200 µg/dL Cortisol (anal.Sens. to highest standard multiplied
with dilution factor of 50)
Linearity of saliva samples
Saliva samples having different cortisol levels were serially diluted with zero
standard. Dilutions covering the full measuring range of the assay were
performed for each sample. Each dilution was measured in duplicate in one
assay run. No relevant deviation of the expected linearity was observed. The
4

--- Page 5 ---
mean linearity recovery for saliva was 97% (range was 83 to 114% recovery).
Linearity of serum samples
Serum samples (already diluted 1:50) having different cortisol levels were
serially diluted with zero standard. The measured concentrations were
multiplied with 50 to get the serum concentration. Dilutions covering the full
measuring range of the assay were performed for each sample. Each dilution
was measured in duplicate in one assay run. No relevant deviation of the
expected linearity was observed. The mean linearity recovery for serum was
105% (range was 90 to 120% recovery).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The complete Kit will have a shelf life of 9 months at 2 – 8°C. Traceability,
stability, and expected values of calibrators and controls were previously
established (k052359).
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity was calculated from the mean of the OD of the zero
calibrator minus 2 SD of 26 replicate analyses. The lowest detectable level
that can be distinguished from the zero standard is 0.015 µg/mL using 4
parameter logistics for curve fit.
e. Analytical specificity:
The cross-reactivity of the cortisol antiserum has been measured against
various compounds. The percent of cross-reactivity is expressed as the ratios
of cortisol concentration to the concentration of the reacting compound at
50% binding of the zero standard.
