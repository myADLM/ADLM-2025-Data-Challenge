more specific alternative chemical method must be used to confirm a result
obtained with this assay. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment
should be applied to any drug-of-abuse test result, particularly when evaluating a
preliminary positive result.
VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 26 is used to calibrate VITROS 5.1

I. Device Description:
The VITROS METD Reagent is a dual chambered package containing ready-to-use
liquid reagents that are used to detect methadone in urine. Sample, calibrators, and
controls are automatically treated with surfactant (DAT Diluent 2) prior to addition of
reagents. Treated sample is added to Reagent 1 containing antibodies reactive to
methadone, glucose-6-phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+),
followed by Reagent 2 containing methadone labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH).
VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 26 is prepared from human urine to
which drugs of abuse, metabolites of drugs of abuse, organic salts, surfactants and
preservative have been added.
VITROS DAT Performance Verifiers I, II, III, IV & V are prepared from a human
urine pool to which analytes, surfactant and preservative have been added. These are
assayed controls used to monitor performance of the VITROS METD Reagent on
VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems.
The product labeling for the Calibrator Kit 26 and Performance Verifiers contain
warnings regarding the presence of human sourced materials and recommend the use

followed by Reagent 2 containing methadone labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH). The assay is based on competition between
methadone in the treated urine sample and the methadone labeled with the enzyme
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH) for antibody binding sites. Enzyme
activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, therefore the concentration of
methadone in the urine sample is directly proportional to measured enzyme activity.
Active enzyme converts oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to
NADH, resulting in an absorbance change that is measured spectrophotometrically at
340 nm.

* Determined using two runs per day with two replicates per run for 22 days, using a single
lot of reagents with one analyzer and five calibrations
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor followed CLSI EP6-A in determining the linear range of their device.
Two urine pools were prepared with methadone concentrations at the low
(0 ng/mL) and high (1000 ng/mL) end of the calibration range. The two pools
were mixed to give 14 admixtures of intermediate concentrations. Linearity
was evaluated using two assay reagent lots and comparing the measured
results against the expected results from 16 pooled samples. A linear
regression was performed and the results indicated acceptable linearity across
the methadone concentration range tested (12 to 736 ng/mL). The reportable
range of the VITROS METD assay is 40-735 ng/mL.
Recovery of Semi-Quantitative Results
Eleven admixtures spanning the reportable range (40 to 735 ng/mL) were
prepared from two human urine-based pools. Methadone values for the
admixtures were calculated based on gravimetric addition of methadone with
GC/MS verification of the high and low pools. Percent recovery was
calculated using the concentration obtained by the VITROS Chemistry
Products METD Assay versus the nominal methadone value.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The assigned values for the calibrators and controls are traceable to the
Cerilliant methadone standard catalogue M-110 and are verified by GC/MS.
Real time and accelerated stability studies were conducted; protocols and
acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. These studies
support the manufacturer’s stability claims. Real time studies are ongoing
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit was determined according to protocol recommendations in CLSI EP-17. The
claimed lower limit for VITROS METD assay is 40 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The specificity of the VITROS Chemistry Products METD assay for various
methadone metabolites and structurally similar compounds was estimated by
generating a dose-response curve for each of the compounds listed below. The
quantity (ng/mL) of a compound necessary to produce a value equivalent to
the methadone quantity (ng/mL) at each cutoff value is listed below. If a
sample contains more than one compound detected by the assay, lower
quantities of cross-reactant than those listed below may produce a value
approximately equivalent to or greater than that of the cutoff value due to their
combined effects.
