c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The assigned values for the Mission Trinity Control were
derived from formulated pilot lots of levels 1, 2, and 3 matching the Bayer
Complete (OEM) Controls as close as possible. The bias with the predicate’s
assay sheet is taken into account. The established ranges are ± 10% with some
exceptions such as CO-OX fractions. The Mission Trinity Control test pilot
lots and Bayer Complete were assayed on the Bayer 855 analyzer for
comparison. The results are presented in the table below.

Stability: The sponsor performed an accelerated stability study of the
Mission Trinity B Controls stored refrigerated at(2-8°C) for 36-months, and
also 12-months stability when stored at room temperature (18-25°C). Real
time stability studies are on-going.
The sponsor’s stability study demonstrated that the Mission Trinity Controls
are stable up to 12 months when stored at 18-25°C or 36 months when stored
at 2-8°C.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected mean and ranges are provided in the labeling. The sponsor
recommends in the labeling that the expected ranges are provided as a guide in
evaluating analyzer performance and that each laboratory should establish its own
acceptance criteria for the control materials.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalent decision.
