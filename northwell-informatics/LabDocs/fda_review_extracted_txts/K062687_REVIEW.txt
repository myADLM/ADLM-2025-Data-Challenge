4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
This submission is for AST Panel only. The ID System was not reviewed.
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST
Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and
equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™
Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST broth, which contains an AST
indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST broth is a cation-adjusted formulation
of Mueller-Hinton broth containing 0.01% Tween 80. After adding the indicator solution
to the AST inoculum the color is blue and after inoculation and incubation changes to
pink then to colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds. Inoculated panels are
barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System
instrument where the panels are continuously incubated at 350C. The AST has a final
inoculum of 5 x 105 CFU/ml. The instrument incubates, reads and records the results of
the biochemical substrates and antimicrobial agents and interprets the reactions to give an
ID of the isolate and MIC value and category interpretation of the antimicrobial agents.
Organisms growing in the presence of a given antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator,
signaling organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or
inhibited by a given antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do
not produce a color change. Additional interpretation is done using software driven
“EXPERT” System using rules derived from the CLSI documentation.
Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an AST result available between 4-16 hours.
This is only an autoread result; no manual readings are possible with this system.

Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S16) “Methods for
Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard.”
L. Test Principle:
The AST portion of the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth
based microdilution method that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-
reduction) to enhance detection of organism growth. The MIC is determined by
comparing growth in wells containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the
growth in “growth control wells” which contains no antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
The data included in this submission were acquired during the clinical studies
performed at multiple sites. The accuracy performance data for limitation
removal and additional organism report groups for clinical and challenge isolates
are contained in this submission. The Reproducibility study was performed in the
previous submission (k033557) and was not performed for this submission
because the drug formulation has not changed. The QC performance was within
the expected ranges as shown under the “Traceabality, Stability…. Section.”
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intersite and Intrasite testing demonstrated >95% reproducibility. The ten
isolate study described in the guidance document was used (10 organisms
tested 3 times on 3 days at 3 sites).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality Control was performed on every test occasion with the following
results. BD Phoenix™ produced acceptable QC results as compared to the
reference method results >95% of the time.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The broth dilution reference panel was prepared according to the CLSI
recommendation and used to compare with the BD Phoenix™ results.
Clinical testing was performed at several sites. The testing included both
fresh clinical isolates and stock isolates along with a challenge set with known
results. Performance chart below includes all data, original with additional
organisms, Pseudomonas spp. including P. aeruginosa, and
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.

EA-Essential Agreement vmj – very major discrepancies
CA-Category Agreement maj - major discrepancies

Essential agreement (EA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panels agree with the
reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference
method. Category agreement (CA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panel result
interpretation (SIR) agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation.
Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the BD Phoenix™ and the
reference and have on-scale EA.
