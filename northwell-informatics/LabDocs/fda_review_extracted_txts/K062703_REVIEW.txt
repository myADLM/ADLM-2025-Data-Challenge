2. Indication(s) for use:
One Step HCG Urine Pregnancy Test is a rapid device, two sites sandwich
immunoassay test device designed for the qualitative determination of human
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) concentration in human urine samples, and
therefore is an aid in the early detection of pregnancy. These test devices are
available in the formats of strip, cassette and midstream. The midstream format is
intended for OTC use. The cassette and strip format are intended for both over-
the counter (OTC) use and use in clinical laboratories.
One Step HCG Serum/Urine Combo Pregnancy Test is a rapid device, two sites
sandwich immunoassay test device designed for the qualitative determination of
human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) concentration in human urine or serum
samples, and therefore is an aid in the early detection of pregnancy. These test
devices are available in strip format and cassette format, and are intended for
professional use in clinical laboratories.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The urine strip, urine cassette, and midstream formats are for both over-the-
counter and professional use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
None required
I. Device Description:
Each test device contains goat anti-mouse (IgG) polyclonal antibody, mouse
monoclonal anti-hCG antibody, and colloidal gold conjugate of monoclonal anti-hCG
antibody. The tests, which are to be sold 1 per kit, are available in strip, cassette, and
midstream formats for OTC use and strip and cassette formats for professional use.

L. Test Principle:
The tests are two-site sandwich immunoassays.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Normal urine and serum that were spiked with hCG concentrations of 62,500,
125,000, 250,000, 500,000, 1,000,000, and 2,000,000 mIU/mL were used to
study the high dose hook effect on the One Step hCG Pregnancy Test. It was
observed that both the test and control bands were visible. However, when
hCG levels were over 500,000 mIU/mL, the higher the hCG concentration
became, the lighter the band at the test region became on all formats.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The device is standardized to the World Health Organization’s 4th
International Standard for Chorionic Gonadotropin.
d. Detection limit:
One Step hCG Pregnancy Test detects urine or serum hCG concentrations
greater than 20 mIU/mL for all formats. However, samples containing less
than 20 mIU/mL hCG may produce a positive result.

To evaluate sensitivity, urine and serum samples from 120 non-pregnant
subjects were spiked with hCG to the concentrations of 0, 10, 15, 20, 40, and
100 mIU/mL. Twenty masked samples at each concentration were tested by
trained technicians. The results were as follows:

Samples of both urine and serum with different hCG concentrations (0, 20,
and 100 mIU/mL) were mixed individually with 1000 mIU LH/mL, 1000 mIU
FSH/mL, and 1000 μIU TSH/mL and gave expected results.
The One Step hCG Pregnancy Test was checked for possible interference
from visibly hemolyzed, lipemic and icteric samples. Human hemoglobin,
bilirubin and albumin were spiked into samples (urine or serum) with different
concentrations of hCG (0 and 20 mIU/mL) and tested on all format types.
Unspiked samples were used as controls. No significant interference was
observed with the concentrations tested. The 0 mIU/mL samples gave all
negative results, and the 20 mIU/mL samples gave all positive results.
Other substances (drugs and common urine and serum analytes) were also
added in negative hCG, 20 mIU/mL, and 50 mIU/mL urine and serum
samples. None of the substances (Table 1 of the package insert) at the
concentrations tested interfered in this assay.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
A consumer study was conducted using one hundred (100) female subjects
between 23-38 years of age. Upon arrival, subjects were provided an
instructional insert, a field survey form, and three lots of the subject devices
(strip, cassette, and midstream formats). The subjects were told to perform the
tests and provide urine samples for coding and testing by trained technicians.

Consumers 96% 98% 97%
The survey results collected showed that most of the women had a secondary
school education or higher and 82% had used a pregnancy test before. Ninety-
five percent (95%) felt the package insert was easy to read and understand and
that the results were easy to read. Ninety-three percent (93%) felt the test was
easy to perform.
4. Clinical cut-off:
