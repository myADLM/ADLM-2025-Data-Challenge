H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
For use with MicroScan® Synergies plus™ Panels read on the WalkAway® -SI System
(including upgraded WalkAway® -40 or WalkAway® -96 to meet WalkAway® SI
equivalence). MicroScan® panels are designed for use in determining quantitative and/or
qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility and/or identification to the species level of
colonies, grown on solid media, of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic
gram-positive cocci and Listeria.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The testing of Linezolid at concentrations of 0.5 –16 µg/mL to the Gram-Positive
MIC/Combo test panel for testing Gram-positive enterococci and staphylococci at 4.5—
16 hours or 16 –20 hours for an overnight reading. The Gram-positive organisms which
may be tested on this panel are Enterococcus faecium (vancomycin-resistant) and
Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant).
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Turbidity method of inoculum preparation only.
For prescription use only.
The ability of the MicroScan® Synergies plus™ Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panels to
detect resistance to Linezolid among Gram-positive isolates is unknown due to the
limited number of resistant strains available at the time of comparative testing.
The current absence of data on resistant staphylococci strains precludes defining any
categories other than “Susceptible”. Strains yielding results suggestive of a
“nonsusceptible” category should be retested, and if the result is confirmed, the isolate
should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
Each panel contains two control wells: a negative control well, and a growth control
well (contains test medium without antibiotic). Antibiotics are diluted in water, buffer, or
2

minute concentrations of broth to selected concentrations prior to dehydration of the panels.
The panel is rehydrated and inoculated at the same time with 0.1 ml of suspension prepared
by the turbidity method (inoculum prepared in 0.4% saline with a very small amount (0.1%)
of Pluronic®--a wetting agent, then 0.1 ml is transferred to 25ml of inoculum Synergies plus
Pos Broth with Pluronic® for a final inoculum concentration of 3-7 X 105 CFU/ml.
Panels are incubated in a Walk-Away® System and read periodically starting at 4.5 hours
until sufficient growth to determine the MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration).
Alternately, the panels may be incubated at 35o C in a non-CO for 16-24 hours and read by
2
visual observation of growth.

Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
The WalkAway® SI uses a Colorimetric Optics System consisting of a color wheel/lamp
assembly and a Photosensor. There is an initial read at 2.5 hours with a possible final read at
4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 8, 12, 16 or 18 hours (overnight instrument readings, manual readings),
depending on the growth rate of the organism being tested. The time of final read is
dependent on the user customization, the growth rate of the organism, and the sensitivity of
the automatic reader since cell densities below 2 x 107 cells/ml are not detected.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Data on the gram-positive panel for Linezolid at 0.5 —16 µg/mL (Long Dilution Sequence)
and Linezolid at 0.5 — 4 µg/mL (4-Dilution Breakpoint Sequence) were evaluated. The
Synergies plus™ readings were obtained at times between 4.5 and 16 hours of incubation
(Rapid read method). An additional comparison was done with readings on the instrument
after 16 – 18 hours incubation for the Overnight Instrument read method, and also for the
Overnight Manual read method, when incubated 16- 18 hours and read visually.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates tested at 3 sites on 3 separate
days in triplicate. The study included the testing on the WalkAway® SI read
at <16 hours, WalkAway® 16-18 hour readings and manual readings at 16-20 hours
incubation. The overall reproducibility results were >95% reproducible for the Long
Dilution Sequence and the 4-Dilution Breakpoint Sequence.
There was a slight trend for the <16 hour reading method to produce more susceptible
results.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC isolate was tested a sufficient number of times with acceptable
results on all testing days with the reference method. The percent QC results that did
not grow in the 4.5—18 hour window was 0% for the E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and
for the S. aureus ATCC 29213.
Quality control results demonstrated the ability of the different reading parameters
(manual and instrument) to produce acceptable results >95% of the time.
The mode for the reference method is the same as the mode produced by each reading
method on the instrument.
The following table provides the frequency of the results in each concentration with
the expected range stated.

2. Comparison studies:
The gram-positive Efficacy Study data were analyzed for both the six (6) well Long Dilution
Sequence (0.5 – 16 µg/mL) and the four (4) well 4-Dilution Breakpoint Sequence (0.5 – 4
µg/mL) for enterococci and staphylococci, for which clearance is requested. The dilutions
provide on-scale results for at least 1 of the CLSI gram-positive Quality Control strains.
Performance claims are based on Rapid read method (<16 hours) results compared to the
reference method overnight results.
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical testing was conducted at 3 sites. A total of 576 Clinical gram-positive
isolates were tested of which 496 were fresh isolates and 80 were stock isolates.
Seven (7) isolates for the Long Dilution Sequence and eight (8) isolates for the
Breakpoint Dilution Sequence, were reported at >= 16 hours and were not included as
Rapid read results. Therefore, of the 576 isolates tested, 568 Rapid read Long
Dilution isolates were analyzed. There were 75 challenge isolates tested at one site
and compared to the reference broth dilution result mode that was determined by
previous testing of each isolate multiple times in the recommended reference panel.
One Challenge isolate reported at ≥ 16 hour and was not included in the Rapid Read
Method results.
The Synergies plus™ readings were obtained at times between 4.5 and 16 hours of
incubation for > 95% of the results. An additional comparison was done with
readings on the instrument after overnight incubation and also read manually when
incubated 16- 18 hours. Performance by these alternate reading methods was also
acceptable with no apparent differences or trends.
The recommended CLSI reference method was followed with the exception of the use
of a small amount (0.1%) of Pluronic® (a wetting agent) in the final inoculum. A
validation of the use of Pluronic® in the frozen reference panels was conducted.
Similar calculations for the different reading methods were performed with very little
difference.
QC was also performed with no difference apparent in the results. The chart below
demonstrates the performance of all three reading methods (Synergies plus™
readings at <16 hours, overnight on the WalkAway® and manually read at 18 hours
using the touchScan®-SR) when compared to the reference method for both dilution
sequences.

EA-Essential Agreement maj-major discrepancies
CA-Category Agreement vmj-very major discrepancies
R-resistant isolates min- minor discrepancies
NA – Essential Agreement results are not applicable for Breakpoint format
Essential agreement (EA) is when the MicroScan® Synergies plus panel
agrees with the reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling
dilution of the reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the
MicroScan® Synergies plus panel interpretation agrees exactly with the
reference panel interpretation. Evaluable (Eval) are results that are within
the test range and on scale.
Of the 75 Challenge isolates tested, the expected results for 72 strains were Susceptible
and 3 strains were Resistant. One Staphylococcus aureus isolate, obtained by Microscan
Technical Services from an external source, was included in the Challenge Set because it
demonstrates a very rare resistance pattern to Linezolid. Further research, utilizing a
national epidemiological database, revealed this resistance pattern occurrence rate for
S. aureus against Linezolid to be <0.1%. The remaining two Linezolid resistant isolates
were Other Staphylococci strains.
One (1) very major error (1/3, 33.3%) occurred in the Challenge Set data. The vmj was
generated by one Other Staphylococci species for all read methods. The vmj was also
generated in both the Long Dilution and the 4-Dilution Breakpoint Sequence data. The
overall combined EA and the CA for the Challenge Set Data was >95% for all read
methods and dilution combinations. Therefore, the Challenge Set performance data are
acceptable.
Performance claims (in bold) that will appear in the labeling and the procedural manual
are based on the Clinical data Rapid read (<16 hour) method results only. The table
below displays the Clinical data results compared by reading method.

The Clinical data Rapid read method EA of 99.1% and the CA of 99.3% are both very
good. Overnight Instrument and Manual read methods EA and CA are both very similar
to the Rapid read method results for the Long Dilution and the 4-Dilution Breakpoint
Sequence data results. There were 2 min errors (2/569, 0.4%) produced by the Rapid
read and the Overnight Manual methods, and 1 min error (1/570, 0.2%) generated by the
Overnight Instrument read method. There also were 2 maj errors (2/563, 0.4%) produced
only by the Rapid read method.
There appears to be a trend for the device to produce a slightly more resistant result as
compared to the reference method, if only by one dilution, but still remaining within EA.
This trend was not observed in the reproducibility study or the QC results data.
The overall error rates are within acceptable limits for all reading methods. The
performance data are acceptable for both the Long Dilution Sequence and for the 4-
Dilution Breakpoint Sequence results using the Rapid read (<16 hour) method.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The interpretative criteria and Quality Control Ranges values are included in the package
insert.
The current absence of data on resistant staphylococci strains precludes defining any
categories other than “Susceptible”. Strains yielding results suggestive of a
“nonsusceptible” category should be retested, and if the result is confirmed, the isolate
should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.
The ability of the MicroScan® Synergies plus™ Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panels to
detect resistance to Linezolid among Gram-positive isolates is unknown due to the
limited number of resistant strains available at the time of comparative testing.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
Performance characteristic claims that will be added to the Procedural Manual and to the
labeling were based on the Clinical data Rapid read (<16 hour) method results only.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
