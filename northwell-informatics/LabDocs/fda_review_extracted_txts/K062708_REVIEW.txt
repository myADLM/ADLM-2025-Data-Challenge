K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The purified synthetic deaminated gliadin peptides are bound to the wells of a
polystyrene microwell plate under conditions that will preserve the antigen in its
native state. Pre-diluted controls and diluted patient sera are added to separate wells,
allowing any anti-gliadin peptide IgA or IgG antibodies present to bind to the
immobilized antigen. Unbound sample is washed away and an enzyme labeled anti-
human IgA and IgG conjugate is added to each well. A second incubation allows the
enzyme labeled anti-human IgA and IgG to bind to patient antibodies which have
bound to the gliadin peptides in the microwells. After washing away any unbound
enzyme labeled anti-human IgA and IgG, the remaining enzyme activity is measured
by adding a chromogenic substrate and measuring the intensity of the color that
develops spectrophotometrically. The color intensity in the patient wells is compared
to the color in the control wells.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The intra-assay precision was determined by testing thirteen serum samples
five times. Results showed that 5 samples with high anti-DGP concentrations
(51.8-162.0 units) had %CV of 0.5-2.7%, 5 samples close to the cut-off (17.4-
27.5 units) had %CV of 1.6-2.8% and 3 negative samples (5.3-7.9 units) had
%CV of 2.6-4.7% (see below).

samples had high anti-DGP concentrations (48.5-157.9 units), 3 samples were
close to the assay cut-off (18.8-27.5 units) and 2 were negative samples (9.8-
16.4 units). The following table summarizes the results with %CV for the
high samples ranged from 2.4-3.8 %, the samples near the cut-off 3.2-3.6%

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no reference standard for gliadin. The positive and negative controls
are prepared in-house and arbitrary units are assigned during the development
process.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference by endogenous substances: No data provided. The package insert
states that grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, microbially contaminated, heat-treated
samples or specimens containing visible particulate should be avoided in this
assay.
Crossreactivity with other autoantibodies: The QUANTA LiteTM Celiac DGP
Screen was tested with 86 sera containing other autoantibodies specific for
Centromere (4), Actin (4), Sm (9), SS-A (12), RNP (9), Jo-1 (9), SS-B (8),
Scl-70 (8), GBM (4), MPO (6), RF (5), Ribo P (4), and M2 (4). All samples
were negative with the QUANTA LiteTM Celiac DGP Screen with a mean
value of 2.4 units which was eight standard deviations below the 20 units cut-
off.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off value of 20 units for the assay was established from a combined
panel of 497 asymptomatic healthy individuals residing in the United States.
Age and gender were available for 300 samples and unavailable for the
remaining 197 samples. Of the 300 samples, there were equal number of
males and females. The age range for the female subjects was 14-76 years
and for the male subjects, 24-78 years. The assay specificity was 99.2%
(493/497). The average value discounting the four positive samples was 3.84
units. Of the 4 positive samples, two were weak positive with values of 20.1
and 20.2 units; and the other two had values of 42.6 and 25.4 units, one of
these subjects was believed to have celiac disease based on a positive tTG
result.

either gliadin II kit, 9 samples were from normal subjects (2 were IgG positive with 20.9
and 23.4 units and 7 were IgA positive with 20.7, 25.8, 34.5, 39.6, 57.9, 80.8, and 106.4
units) and 2 samples from celiac patients on a gluten free diet (one was 20.1 units on
Gliadin IgG II and the other was 25.3 units on Gliadin IgA II).
b. Matrix comparison:
The assay use serum as matrix.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
The clinical sensitivity and specificity study were evaluated on 885 clinically
defined samples from patients with the following diagnosis: 85 Celiacs, 50
Celiac IgA Deficient, 33 Celiacs on Gluten-Free Diet, 18 Celiac 1st degree
relatives, 65 Dermatitis Herpetiformis, 36 IgA Deficient Controls, 81 Non-
