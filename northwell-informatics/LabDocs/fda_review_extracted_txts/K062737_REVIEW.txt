L. Test Principle:
For total creatine kinase, the reagents supplied cause a chemical reaction which
produces an amount of gluconate-6-phosphate+NADPH+H+ which is proportional to
the amount of creatine kinase in the sample.
For myoglobin, the method used in this assay is a turbidimetric immunoassay. When
an antigen-antibody reaction occurs between Mb in a sample and anti-Mb antibody
which has been sensitized to latex particles, agglutination results. This agglutination
is detected as an absorbance change, with the magnitude of the change being
proportional to the quantity of Mb in the sample. The actual concentration is then
determined by interpolation from a calibration curve prepared from calibrators of
known concentration.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity for CK NAC was assessed for non-post dilution samples in
accordance with CLSI EP6-A. Samples used for this study were in house
preparations of CK aqueous solution. Two different studies with ten different
levels of total CK (each tested 4 times except for lowest dilution of the low
level study which was sampled twice) were prepared based on the dilution of
the highest concentration solution level with a solution near the low limit of
detection resulting in a range of samples from 8.48 to 147 U/L and 81.38 to
1510 U/L. The linearity of the CK NAC assay was evaluated by comparing
observed versus expected values across the expected range. A linear
regression analysis was performed on the data and plotted. The sponsor’s
acceptable bias for recovery of the samples is ±8%. The observed linearity
across the 8.48 to 147 U/L range has a slope of 0.993, and an intercept of
0.5558. The observed linearity across the 81.38 to 1510 U/L range has a slope

of 0.9995, and an intercept of 0.3936. The assay range was demonstrated to
be linear from 8.48 to 1510 U/L. The sponsor will claim a range of 8 (the
detection limit) to 1500 U/L. Recovery of post dilution serum samples was
also assessed comparing manual versus automatic dilution by the PENTRA
400. Five serum samples were each tested 4 times and ranged from 1610 to
4263 U/L. The sponsor’s acceptable bias for recovery of the samples is
±10%. The data supports the sponsor’s claim of a post dilution limit of 4500
U/L.
Linearity for Myoglobin was assessed for non-post dilution samples in
accordance with CLSI EP6-A. Samples used for this study were human
serum. Eleven different levels of myoglobin (each tested 4 times) were
prepared based on the dilution of the highest concentration solution level with
a solution near the low limit of detection resulting in a range of samples from
48 to 482.6 ng/mL. The linearity of the assay was evaluated by comparing
observed versus expected values across the expected range. A linear
regression analysis was performed on the data and plotted. The sponsor’s
acceptable bias for recovery of the samples is ±10%. The observed linearity
across the reportable range has a slope of 0.9998, and an intercept of 0.0667.
The assay range was demonstrated to be linear from 48 to 482.6 ng/mL. The
sponsor will claim a range of 20.4 (the lowest value of the comparison study)
to 500 ng/mL (the value of the highest calibrator). The lower values of 20.4
to 48 where found to be acceptable for the claimed range as the predicate
device included this range in its claim and the sponsor showed equivalence at
these levels. Recovery of post dilution serum samples was also assessed
comparing manual versus automatic dilution by the PENTRA 400. Seven
samples were each tested 4 times and ranged from 513.9 to 2301.1 ng/mL.
The sponsor’s acceptable bias for recovery of the samples is ±10%. The data
supports the sponsor’s claim of a post dilution limit of 2500 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Real time stability at 8°C was investigated for Myoglobin calibrator.
Recovery of the values for the calibration points in Myoglobin was assayed
for 3 lots periodically over a period of 18 months. The closed stability study
was performed over a period providing data to support the sponsor’s claim of
closed stability between 2 - 10°C for 12 months. Real time stability studies
after opening were performed. Recovery of the values for the calibration
points in Myoglobin was assayed for 1 lot periodically over a period of 7
weeks, providing data supporting a stability period of 7 weeks at 8°C.
Real time stability at 8°C was investigated for Immuno II Control L/H.
Recovery of the values in Myoglobin and Ferritin for the Low and High
controls was assayed for 3 lots during 27 to 29 months. The closed stability
study was performed over a period providing data to support the sponsor’s
claim of closed stability of 27 months at 8°C. Stability after reconstitution
and storage frozen at -20°C was investigated for Immuno II Control L/H.
10

Stability studies after reconstitution were performed providing data supporting
a stability of 3 months at -20°C for ABX Pentra Immuno II Control L/H after
reconstitution and a closed stability of 24 months between 2 - 10°C.
For ABX PENTRA N Control & ABX PENTRA P Control traceability, the
values of the ABX PENTRA Controls are assigned from the ABX PENTRA
calibrator, reagents and analyzers. The target value is determined by the
median of results from 150 measurements/parameters. Confidence range is
determined as the calculated range in percent which is based on the
experimental results from the previous target value trials. The range declared
in the target value sheet is equal to the assigned value +/- 3 standard
deviations (3 SD).
For ABX Pentra Multical traceability, the ABX Pentra Multical is prepared
from reference materials. Commercial calibrators are standardized by means
of a master lot which is stored at -80°C. Two controls are used to ensure that
the calibration values of the master lot, as well as the entire measurement
system (calibrator, reagent, and analyzer), remain stable during the storage
period. The target value is determined by the median of results from 150
measurements/parameters.
For the ABX PENTRA N Control, ABX PENTRA P Control, and ABX
PENTRA Multical, protocols and acceptance criteria for open and closed
stability of the controls and calibrators were described and found to be
acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit for the CK NAC was determined by measuring 30
measurements of saline water (NaCl 0.9 g/L) + 4.65 SD. The limit of
detection for the CK NAC assay was determined to be 8 U/L.
Because the measurement of saline water is not possible with the normal
application of the Myoglobin assay (no results available when sample
concentration is lower than the calibration curve), usual measurement of MDL
(30 measurements of saline water) is not possible. For the specific proteins
the Minimum Interpretation Limit (MIL) is used. Like MDL, MIL is the
lower concentration that could be distinguished from 0, concentration
calculated using the rate absorbency measurement of known concentration’s
samples and saline water. The limit of detection for the Myoglobin assay was
determined to be 6.7 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
For CK NAC: In accordance with the Valtec guideline, the tested interferants
were added to base serum at two different CK concentrations (normal and
high). The base serum with each substance was then serially diluted with the
same base serum and saline to adjust CK concentration. Hemoglobin up to 55
11

µmol/l (97 mg/dL), total bilirubin up to 125 µmol/L (7.3 mg/dL), direct
bilirubin up to 100 µmol/l (5.9 mg/dL) and triglycerides (as Intralipid ®,
representative of lipemia) up to 7 mmol/L (612.5 mg/dL) do not interfere with
CK determination by this test.
For Myoglobin: Substances were added to the base serum at two different
myoglobin concentrations (normal and high). The base serum with each
substance was then serially diluted with the same base urine serum and saline
to adjust myoglobin concentration. Hemoglobin up to 195 µmol/l (336
mg/dL), total bilirubin up to 500 µmol/L (29.3 mg/dL), direct bilirubin up to
500 µmol (29.3 mg/dL) and triglycerides (as Intralipid ®, representative of
lipemia) up to 7 mmol/L (612.5 mg/dL) do not interfere with myoglobin
determination by this test. The sponsor also determined a prozone effect for
the Myoglobin assay to occur at 1374 ng/mL with dilution being effective in
overcoming the effect.

Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 175 serum and plasma samples were run using the CK NAC
reagents on the PENTRA 400 and a reference method. Samples ranged from
8.0 to 1408 U/L. Diluted or spiked samples (59) were used to cover the range
of the assay. Linear regression analysis gave the following relationship:
Device = 1.056(Predicate) – 2.253; r = 0.9967.
A total of 90 serum and plasma samples were run using the Myoglobin
reagents on the PENTRA 400 and a reference method. Clinical non-spiked
samples ranged from 20.4 to 484 ng/mL. Linear regression analysis gave the
following relationship: Device = 0.920(Predicate) + 22.251; r = 0.9876.
b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor demonstrated equivalence of CK NAC results in serum and
Lithium Heparin plasma samples by using 42 clinical samples spanning a
range of 29 to 1197 U/L. Linear regression showed a slope of 0.96 and an
intercept of 1.04, and a correlation coefficient of 0.999.
The sponsor demonstrated equivalence of Myoglobin results in serum and
Lithium Heparin plasma samples by using 69 clinical samples spanning a
