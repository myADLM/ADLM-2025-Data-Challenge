Measuring Range 4 – 450 ng/ml 8 – 450 ng/ml

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced
L. Test Principle:
When a sample containing ferritin is mixed with the Ferritin - LATEX reagent and
the reaction buffer included in the kit, ferritin reacts with the antibodies leading to
agglutination of the latex particles. The agglutination is detected as turbidity change
(the decrease of transmitted light caused by the aggregates measured at 600 nm) and
is directly proportional to the concentration of ferritin in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed on an OLYMPUS AU640 Clinical
Chemistry Analyzer using OLYMPUS ITA Control Levels (Low, Medium,
and High). The within run, between run, and total %CV were calculated
according to CLSI (NCCLS) EP5-A protocol.
Within Run Total
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3
Mean (ng/mL) 38.0 108.1 224.1 38.0 108.1 224.1
SD 1.22 1.42 2.23 1.50 1.75 3.20
% CV 3.20 1.31 0.99 3.94 1.62 1.43
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was performed on an OLYMPUS AU640 Clinical Chemistry
Analyzer according to CLSI (NCCLS) EP6-P Guideline. A serum sample
with high Ferritin level was serially diluted and each of the 14 dilutions was
assayed in quadruplicate on the Olympus AU 640. The acceptance criterion is
± 10% deviation from regression line. The percent deviation from the
regression line for the 14 points ranged from -10.2 to 3.1%. The assay is
linear over the reportable range of 4-450 ng/ml.

Prozone Effect: High pool of Ferritin (SCIPAC) was diluted with saline. No
hook effect was observed for the tested specimen at 10,000 ng/ml compared to
the upper limit of the measuring range of 450 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended calibrator is standardized against the WHO 3rd
International Standard for ferritin, Recombinant NBSC code: 94/572.
d. Detection Limit:
The Lowest Detectable Level was defined as the Mean (20 replicates) + 3SD
= 0.8 + 3(0.9) = 3.4 ng/mL. Detection Limit is stated at 4.0ng/mL.
Functional Lower Limit is estimated to be 4.0ng/mL. A serum with initial
concentration value of 58.7ng/mL was serially diluted 1:1 with saline (0.9g
NaCl /100ml).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference: Interference testing was performed by spiking levels of each
interferant into pooled serum. Acceptance criterion was set at ≤± 10%
(Final/Original results x 100%).
• Ascorbic Acid: Less than 5% up to 3 mg/dL ascorbic acid
• Hemolysis: Less than 5% up to 500 mg/dL hemoglobin.
• Lipemia: Less than 10% up to 400 mg/dL Intralipid®.
• Icterus: Less than 5% up to 20 mg/dL bilirubin.
• Rheumatoid Factor: Less than 5% up to 900 IU/ml RF.
