DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
k062756
B. Purpose for Submission:
New device.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
BioImagene, Inc.’s Pathiam IHC Module software for Her2/neu
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Computer-assisted image analyzer for immunohistochemistry
(immunocytochemistry) slides. The Her2/neu test is semi-quantitative.
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
PATHIAM is a standalone software program employing image analysis in an
assessment of shape, size and density of a digital image of a specimen. It will
provide semi-quantitative assessment of Her-2/neu staining intensity and
distribution in user-selected fields, and display a semi-quantitative score, which
can be reviewed by the pathologist as he/she views the digital image of the
selected field.
PATHIAM software is a standalone software application that will work on a
system with the following accessories (required but not provided) with the
following features:
Computer
• Processor: 2.4 GHz, Pentium IV equivalent
• Memory: 512 MB RAM
• Operating System: Windows 2000 or later
• Hard Drive: minimum 100MB for software installation, 20GB for image
storage
• LAN connectivity, minimum 100 MBPS (recommended), support for USB
interface, support for HTTP, TCP/IP protocols (using the Operating system)
• High Speed Graphic Accelerator Card (1024 x 768)
• 17” High resolution display monitor
• 24 bit color depth
• Font Setting: Small font (DPI setting: 96 DPI)
Digitizing Equipment: Camera

• Frame rate: 20 fps@1200 x 768 resolution (6 fps @ 2048 x 1536 resolution)
• Sampling Frequency of 6.26 square/µm
• Compression format: JPEG 2000, BMP, TIFF. JPEG
• Color 24-bit (R, G, B)

--- Page 2 ---
Digitizing Equipment: Digital Side Scanner
• Input Format: 25X75mm microscope slides
• Resolution: 54,000 pixel/inch with 20X objective
• Method: Line-scanning
• File Format: TIFF/JPEG2000; compliant with TIFF 6.0 standard.
• Color 24-bit (R, G, B)
• Connectivity: 100/1000 MBPS Ethernet
• Compression format: JPEG 2000, BMP, TIFF. JPEG
The software allows both archiving of the digital image, and semi quantitative
analysis of extent and intensity of stained tissue, providing the pathologist with an
aid to interpretation of level of expression of Her2/neu in breast cancer tissue.
The pathologist is presented with a digital image of the tissue section and a
suggested staining score (0 to 3). The pathologist then makes an assessment of
the digital image and reports his/her score.
PATHIAM employs several Quality Assurance algorithms to assure that only
analyzable images are processed by the software.
2. Principles of Operation:
The first step in the process requires the user to acquire an image using a digital
scanner or camera. From this image, the user must use their judgment and
training as a pathologist to select the field(s) that contains the representative
tumor cells. This process mimics the current practice of pathologists examining
tissue under a microscope, finding the areas that contain diagnostically useful
information and ignoring areas that are not useful. Once the field(s) is selected,
the user may use the drawing tools to select sections within a field that are most
representative of the tumor.
Within the user selected sections, there are tumor cells and also likely artifacts
and stromal cells. When the user launches the analysis function, the software
automatically detects and differentiates between tumor cells, stromal cells and
artifacts using morphological features. After eliminating stromal cells and
artifacts, the software automatically determines the total number of positively
stained and unstained tumor cells as well as the median intensity, extent and
thickness of membrane staining. Therefore, the section(s) is user-selected. Then
the software automatically identifies certain features in that section. The user
does not need to manually dissect away stromal cells and artifacts in the field.
This device is not yet well established, but neither is it new or unproven.
3. Modes of Operation:
Semi-automated computer-assisted interpretation.
4. Specimen Identification:
A JPEG, BMP or TIFF image is captured from an individual slide by a
pathologist using a digitizing scanner or digital camera and placed in an identified
computer file. This file is acquired by the PATHIAM software. Each patient’s
file is identified using a “surgical pathology number” (SPN) assigned to each
2

--- Page 3 ---
patient.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded slides of breast tissues are handled manually.
6. Calibration:
No calibration is employed.
7. Quality Control:
The performance of the system depends on the quality control of the staining
using the recommended immunohistochemistry (immunocytochemistry) kit
associated with the PATHIAM. The PATIAM software also assesses the quality
of the image to make sure it passes minimum standards before it is analyzed.
The image analysis algorithms consider the following Image Quality Aspects and
the image will be rejected if there is:
1. Small tissue area: Where the area % < 20
2. Poor overall contrast:
a. Gray standard deviation< 10, OR
3. Counter-stained poor contrast:
a. Counter-stained standard deviation< 5
b. If stained pixel % < 15 AND counter-stained standard deviation ≤ 11
4. Over stained: Stained pixel % ≥ 98.5
5. Mask on Image: Stained pixel % = 100 or a tint throughout the image due
to color filter settings of the digital camera.
6. High texture: If the tissue was too thick, it will result in an image of poorer
quality with muddy background and more artifacts due to lack of light
passing through the tissue.
a. If stained pixel % < 2 AND Red Mean is < 160 AND the value of
Blue - Red mean is ≥ 20

Agreement with Manual Scoring
Agreement was evaluated between manual HER2/neu scores and raw PATHIAM scores,
and manual HER2/neu scores and PATHIAM HER2/neu score after they had been
reviewed by three pathologists at three different laboratories employing the following
different image acquisition setups to produce images of the same set of slides. The
equipments used at the different laboratories were:
• Site #1: Light Microscope: Olympus BH2, Lens: Olympus S Plan 20X PL
microscope objective. Magnification = 20X. Numeric Aperture: 0.46. Tube Length:
160. Cover slip = 0.17. Light source: Halogen lamp. Camera: PAXcam 3, Model
number Px3 – CM. Serial Number = 4110130
• Site #2: ScanScope T3 (Aperio Technologies Inc), digital slide scanner
• Site #3: ScanScope T2 (Aperio Technologies Inc), digital slide scanner
176 specimens of breast cancer were stained for HER2/neu using the DAKO HercepTest,
and were used for the study. The images were first scored by PATHIAM. One week
later they were read manually by the same pathologist. The results are presented in 4X4
tabulations for HER2/neu scores of 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+.

PATHIAM raw score is more consistent than inter-pathologist comparison.
The consistency is improved even more when the PATHIAM score assists
the pathologist in their interpretation.
