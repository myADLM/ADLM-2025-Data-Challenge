I. Device Description:
Sensititre® MIC Susceptibility plate MIC panels are multi-well plastic microtitre
plates, precision dosed with dried, stabilized antimicrobics. This is a microversion of the
classic broth dilution methods and can provide both qualitative and quantitative
susceptibility results. The medium required for testing S. pneumoniae is Sensititre®
Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth with 2 – 5% lysed horse blood with a final organism density
of 5 X 105 colony units (CFU/mL). This is then incubated in a non CO incubator for
2
20 – 24 hour and read manually for growth or using the Sensititre® autoread.

Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S16) “Methods for
Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard.”
L. Test Principle:
The Sensititre® Autoread System utilizes fluorescence technology to read 24 hour
Streptococcus pneumoniae plates. The technology involves the detection of bacterial
growth by monitoring the activity of specific surface enzymes produced by the test
organism. Growth is determined by generating a fluorescent product from a non-
fluorescent (fluorogenic) substrate. The non-fluorescent substrate is prepared by
conjugating a fluorescent compound to the specific enzyme substrates with a bond,
which prevents fluorescence. The fluorophore, is then said to be quenched. The
substrate is added to the inoculum broth and dispensed into the test plates at the same
time as the test organism or the plates can be prepared with the substrate already
added to the plate. Enzymatic action of the bacterial surface enzymes on the specific
substrates, cleave this bond releasing the fluorophore, which is now capable of
fluorescence. The amount of fluorescence detected is directly related to the activity
of bacterial growth. The MIC is determined by observing the lowest dilution of
antimicrobial agent that inhibits growth of the organism or automatically for the
detection of fluorescence.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC isolate, S. pneumoniae 49619 was tested daily with
acceptable results. Quality control was also performed at all sites using both
manual and autoread methods. The Sensititre® results demonstrated that the
system can produce QC results in the recommended range for both manual
and automated read methods. The mode is the same between the reference
method and the two read methods.
An additional QC organism S. pneumoniae #5 was tested to provide on-scale
results. The reference method was in range for every day tested.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The recommended broth dilution reference panel was prepared according to the
CLSI recommendation. Clinical testing included both fresh and stock clinical
isolates and a set of challenge organisms. The broth reference panel for
Streptococcus spp. was set up on MH supplemented with 2% to 5% lysed horse
blood as recommended by CLSI and incubated in a non CO2 incubator for 20 – 24
hours. The comparison resulted in the following performance evaluations as
reflected below.

EA is when there is agreement between the reference method and the Sensititre®
panel within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of antibiotic. Category
agreement (CA) is when the Sensititre® panel interpretative results, Sensitive,
Intermediate, and Resistant (SIR) agrees exactly with the reference panel result
interpretation. Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the
Sensititre® and the reference and have on-scale EA. The EA% is acceptable when

* (CLSI Comment) For some organism/antimicrobial agent combinations, the
absence or rare occurrence of resistant strains precludes defining any results
categories other than “susceptible.” For strains yielding results suggestive of a
“nonsusceptible” category, organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility
test results should be confirmed. Subsequently, the isolates should be saved and
submitted to a reference laboratory that will confirm results using a CLSI/NCCLS
reference dilution method.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The expected value range, interpretive criteria and QC for gram positive panels are
included in the package insert. The labeling is sufficient and satisfies the
requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
