L. Test Principle:
The EliA Celikey IgA wells are coated with human recombinant tTG. If present in the
patient’s specimen, antibodies to tTG bind to their specific antigen in the wells. After
washing away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgA
(EliA IgA conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After
incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away and the bound complex is incubated
with a development solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the
reaction mixture is measured. The higher the response value, the more specific IgA is
present in the specimen. To evaluate test results, the response for the patient samples
is compared directly to the response for IgA calibrators.

The precision of the assay on ImmunoCAP 100 instrument was determined by
testing four serum samples in duplicate on seven instruments in 23 runs on
one EliA Celikey IgA well batch, together with one set of system reagent.
Results showed that 2 samples positive with anti-tTG IgA (11.2-27.3U/mL)
had ≤4.1 %CV and ≤6.8% CV for the intra-assay and inter-assay studies
respectively; and 2 negative samples (1.0-7.9 U/mL) had ≤7.2 %CV and
≤13.3% CV for the intra-assay and inter-assay studies respectively (see
below).

The precision of the assay on ImmunoCAP 250 instrument was determined by
testing four serum samples in duplicate on two instruments in 14 runs on one
EliA Celikey IgA well batch, together with one set of system reagent. Results
showed that 3 samples positive with anti-tTG IgA (11.0-126.1 U/mL) had
≤5.1 %CV and ≤4.4% CV for the intra-assay and inter-assay studies
respectively; and one negative sample (0.4 U/mL) had 10.4 %CV and 8.1%
CV for the intra-assay and inter-assay studies respectively (see below).

2 11.0 4.8 2.8
3 15.6 4.1 1.6
4 126.1 5.1 4.4
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity by dilution was tested using 5 anti-tTG IgA positive samples (20.5-
72.8 µg/L). These samples were tested in duplicates for dilutions 1/100, 1/200,
1/400, 1/800 and 1/1600. The results of the dilutions were compared with their
expected value. The ratio observed/expected values were calculated.
Specifications for the ratio (O/E) were 0.8 and 1.2 within all sample dilutions.
Samples 1 and 5 had results of 1.2-1.4, which were slightly above 1.2. The
following sentence had been included in package insert: “Please note that due
to differing binding characteristics of the antibodies in patient samples, not all
sera can be diluted linearly within the measuring range”.
Hook Effect:
The possibility of antigen excess occurring when using the device was
evaluated with serum sample above the assay measuring range. The
measuring range for EliA Celikey IgA is from 0.1 to ≥128 EliA U/mL. No

hook effect was observed for concentrations up to 654 µg/L, which is 8 fold
above the measuring range.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The EliA IgA calibrators are traceable (via unbroken of calibrations) to the
International Reference Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of the Human Serum
Immunoglobulins A, G, M from WHO. New batches of IgA calibrators are
compared to a secondary standard (standardized with the IRP) or the IRP
directly and adjusted accordingly to meet the correct concentration (6 levels).
There are no international standards for tTG antibodies. The positive and
negative controls are prepared in house and arbitrary EliA Units/mL are
assigned during the development process.
d. Detection limit:
The lower limit of the measuring range was determined by measuring
dilutions (1/2, 1/4, and 1/8) of Calibrator 0.3 (0.3 µg/L) in EliA IgA Calibrator
wells. The results in Response Units (RU) were compared with the result of
the sample diluent on EliA Celikey IgA wells. All the samples were measured
in triplicates. The discrimination ability ‘D’ of the assay should be >2 for
calibrator 0.3 diluted 1:4 (i.e. 0.075 µg/L IgA/L). The 1/8 diluted calibrator
0.3 (0.0375 µg/L) still can be discriminated from background given by the
signal of the diluent on Celikey IgA wells (as shown in the table below). The
lower limit of detection was set at 0.05 µg/L corresponding to 0.1 EliA U/mL.

The potential interferent and the corresponding blanks were added to two anti-
tTG positive sera from patients with Celiac disease. The spiked samples were
tested in triplicate. The ratio of the result of the sample spiked with the
interfering substances and the sample spiked with a buffer blank was
determined as shown in the table below:

f. Assay cut-off:
The purpose of the normal sera studies was to evaluate expected values in the
normal population and to confirm the defined cut-off. Samples from 400
apparently healthy Caucasian adult blood donors were measured. The
individuals were equally distributed by age and gender.
The results were equally distributed and not dependent on age or gender. The
99th percentile (7.4 U/mL) lies below the lower limit of the equivocal range
(7-10 U/mL).
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate:
Testing was performed on 244 samples from clinically defined patients (93
celiac, 101 non-celiac normal biopsy, 10 Ulcerative Colitis, 10 Morbus Crohn,
20 Rheumatoid Arthritis, 10 Rheumatoid factor positive samples. Equivocals
were excluded from the percent agreement calculations. The Positive Percent
Agreement was 100% (89/89); the Negative Percent Agreement was 100%
(144/144); and the Overall Agreement was 100% (233/233) (see table below).

The assay uses serum and plasma (EDTA, citrate) as sample matrices.
Sixty sets of samples from different donors were tested. Each set contained
serum, EDTA, heparin, and citrate plasma samples. Specifications were as
follows: mean quota of plasma to serum concentration should be 0.8-1.2 for
positive sera and negative samples should not switch to positive in all serum
and plasma sample. Linear regression comparing the quota between serum
and each type of plasma for the samples was performed as shown below:

The specification for the positive samples in this study was fulfilled for EDTA

remain negative in all serum and plasma samples. The following sentence was
included in package insert Specimen Collection section: “the use of plasma
preparations with heparin is not recommended because heparin interferes with
the measurement of tTG antibodies”.
c. Instrument Platform comparison:
For this comparison study, a total of 36 samples distributed over the measuring
range were assayed as follows: 4 negative samples, 2 equivocal samples and 30
positive samples. All samples were run on three ImmunoCAP250 instruments
and three ImmunoCAP100 instruments in two runs and in single replicates.
Specification for correlation was fulfilled (r >0.9). Results of the conformance
study are summarized in the figure below:
