Test Time 6 seconds 30 seconds
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI EP5-A: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices
L. Test Principle:
Glucose measurement is based on electrical potential caused by the reaction of glucose with
the reagents contained on the strip’s electrodes. The glucose in the sample is oxidized by the
enzyme glucose oxidase, and the current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured
and converted to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is
proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated the precision of the device using replicate measurements of
glucose adjusted venous whole blood with 3 different strip lots. Within-run precision
was performed using ten replicates each of 5 glucose concentrations and 2 levels of
glucose control solutions. Between-run precision was performed using ten replicates
per day of 5 glucose concentrations and 2 levels of glucose control solutions for ten
days were tested on ten meters each tested with 3 strip lots. Results are summarized
below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To establish the linearity of the Gluco Track system whole blood samples were
compared to YSI 2300 with three lots of test strips using 8 different glucose
concentrations. For each lot of test strips, 10 meters where tested for each
concentration. Linear regression yields the following statistics:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The device is traceable to a laboratory analyzer which is calibrated to a glucose
standard (NIST SRM 965a).
Stability characteristics of both levels of control solutions were determined using real
time aging studies to determine the open vial storage stability at room temperature to
be 18 months and unopened vial stability to be 24 months.
The expected values for the two glucose control solutions were established by repeat
testing (10 times) on two meters using one lot of strips for both glucose levels. The
expected results may change with each new lot, but the control range is listed in the
product insert.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the Gluco Track Blood Glucose Monitoring System is 20 -
600 mg/dL. This level was determined to be detectable by the linearity study (above).
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor tested the following substances for interference. Interference was
identified as having a percent bias greater than ±20%. The following results were
determined with regard to interfering substances:

An altitude study was performed with 20 tests each of 5 different concentrations of
glucose spiked whole blood spanning 51 to 405 mg/dL. The tested samples met the
sponsor’s acceptance criteria of a standard deviation ≤ 4.5 mg/dL when the glucose
concentration was <75 mg/dL and ≤ 6% CV for glucose concentrations ≥ 75 mg/dL
and 95% of samples falling within ±15 mg/dL when the glucose concentration was
<75 mg/dL and ±20% for glucose concentrations ≥ 75 mg/dL. The altitude study was
performed at 7464 feet (2275 meters); however the sponsor will make the claim of no
effect on blood glucose measurements of up to 6562 feet (2000 meters).

To test the accuracy of the hematocrit effect, three lots, and 20 meters per lot, with
blood adjusted to hematocrit levels of 30%, 40%, 50%, and 55% at glucose
concentrations of 20-40, 41-80, 100-150, 151-250, 300-500, 501-580 mg/dL were
tested. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria was a bias of ±15 mg/dL when the glucose
concentration was <75 mg/dL and ±20% for glucose concentrations ≥ 75 mg/dL when
compared to the 40% hematocrit values.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor demonstrated that the Gluco Track Blood Glucose Monitoring System
for finger stick is equivalent to a standard methods (YSI-2300) by having 153 patient
samples from 54 to 480 mg/dL (according to YSI) with a hematocrit range of 31-53%
test their blood. A technician was also present to test the blood of the patients as well
as testing 7 contrived samples that were 32 to 48 mg/dL. The studies are summarized
below:

N. Instrument Name:
Gluco Track Blood Glucose Monitoring System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ______
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger only. Since
the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no special handling or
storage issues.
5. Calibration:
A code strip is provided with each batch of test strips to calibrate the meter for that batch.
No further calibrations are required of the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor is providing single level control solution with this device, and a second level
is available. When a test strip is inserted into the meter, a control can be run. An
acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is
referred to the troubleshooting section of the owner’s manual if control results fall
outside these ranges.
