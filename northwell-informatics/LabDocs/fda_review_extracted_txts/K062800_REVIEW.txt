upper-arm, the calf and the thigh. It is intended for use by healthcare professionals and
people with diabetes mellitus at home as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of
diabetes control program. It is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes
mellitus, and is not intended for use on neonates.
The alternative site testing in the systems can be used only during steady-state blood
glucose conditions.
The system is also intended to be used to measure non-invasively the systolic and
diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate of an adult individual, over age 16, at home.
For the Clever Chek TD-3213/ Clever Chek TD-3215/ Dr. T TD-3216/ Clever Chek TD-
3217 system, the blood pressure is measured by using a technique in which an inflatable
cuff is wrapped around the wrist. The cuff circumference is limited to 5.25”~7.75”.
For Clever Chek TD-3250 system, the blood pressure is measured by using a technique in
which an inflatable cuff is wrapped around the arm. The cuff circumference is limited to

The Clever Chek TD-3213, Clever Chek TD-3215, Dr. T TD-3216, Clever Chek TD-3217,
and Clever Chek TD-3250 Blood Glucose plus Blood Pressure Monitoring Systems each
consist of four main products: the blood glucose meter, test strips (including the “check &
code” strip), control solutions (2 levels of TaiDoc control solution – cleared under k012430),
and the lancet device (cleared under k833344). These products have been designed and
tested to work together as a system to produce accurate blood glucose test results. The
systems also have a blood pressure component, though as the changes to the device
compared to the predicate involve only the glucose testing portion the focus of the testing
was primarily on the blood glucose performance characteristics.

L. Test Principle:
For the blood glucose portion: Once a whole blood sample is applied to the sample chamber
of the test strip, glucose measurement commences. Glucose measurement is based on
electrical potential caused by the reaction of glucose with the reagents contained on the
strip’s electrodes. The glucose in the sample is oxidized by the enzyme glucose oxidase,
producing gluconolactone. The current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured
and converted to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is
proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor has evaluated the precision of the device using the TD-3217 meter
(which is technologically similar to the TD-3213, TD-3215, TD-3216, TD-3250, and
TD-4207 meters). The sponsor evaluated the precision of the TD-3217 using
replicate measurements of glucose control solutions and spiked anticoagulated venous

control solutions each with 3 different lots test strips. Samples were tested with 10
measurements obtained from 10 meters with each level of control solution (for a total
of 300 tests) over 10 days. The range for each control solution level is an
experienced result in periods of 6 months. Each level was established as an average
value first, which for low is 77 mg/dL, for normal is 135 mg/dL, and for high is 325
mg/dL. Then the range of each level was established from the average minus/plus
20% (20% is from ISO15197, minimum acceptable accuracy), giving low ranges of
61 to 93 mg/dL, normal ranges from 108 to 162 mg/dL, and high ranges from 260 to

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the device was demonstrated by comparing 9 levels of whole blood
samples on the TD-3217 and a glucose reference method (YSI-2300) in k061181.
The samples ranged in concentration from a low of approximately 22 mg/dL to a high
of approximately 587 mg/dL (from YSI). Linear regression of the comparison data
yielded the following relationship: ACHTUNG = (0.9851x YSI-2300) + 5.4, r2 =
0.9995. The reportable range of the ACHTUNG TD-3217 Blood Glucose Monitoring
System is 20 - 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The controls supplied with this device were previously cleared under k012430. The
sponsor has shown traceability of the meter to a laboratory analyzer.
d. Detection limit:
20 mg/dL. The sponsor supported this level with a linearity study (above).
e. Analytical specificity:
The specificity of the device was assessed with the TD-3217 meter. Elevated blood
triglycerides and the following substances do not affect results: acetaminophen,
dopa, methyldopa, L-dopa and tolbutamide occurring in expected blood
concentrations. Reducing substances such as uric acid and ascorbic acid occurring in
expected blood concentrations was shown to not cause interference. The altitude
study also showed that the percentage of mean difference between strips is within the
acceptable range (from ISO15197, minimum acceptance accuracy: within ±20%

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor demonstrated that the TD-3217 for finger stick is equivalent to a
standard method (YSI-2300) and can be used on alternate sites (specifically the
capillary blood from finger compared to the palm, forearm, upper arm, calf, and
thigh). The sponsor assessed accuracy by having 147 patients from 3 different sites
using a standard method compared to finger stick. For the finger stick against the
standard method, samples ranged as follows: 10% of samples were 20-50 mg/dL,
36% of samples were 51-110 mg/dL, 29% of samples were 111-150 mg/dL, 11% of
samples were 151-250 mg/dL, 15% of samples were 251-600 mg/dL, and 15% of
samples were 401-600 mg/dL. For the AST sites, the samples ranged as follows:
40% of samples were 51-110 mg/dL, 30% of samples were 111-150 mg/dL, 20% of
samples were 151-250 mg/dL, and 10% of samples were 251-600 mg/dL. All
patients blood glucose levels were in a steady state for these studies. The studies are

N. Instrument Name:
Clever Chek TD-3213, Clever Chek TD-3215, Dr. T TD-3216, Clever Chek TD-3217, and
Clever Chek TD-3250 Blood Glucose plus Blood Pressure Monitoring Systems
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, the palm,
the forearm, the upper-arm, the calf, and the thigh only. Since the whole blood sample is
applied directly to the test strip there are no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
A code strip is provided with each batch of test strips to calibrate the meter for that batch.
No further calibrations are required of the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor is providing a high and low glucose control solution with this device. When
a test strip is inserted into the meter, the control mode can be activated. This prevents
control results from being stored in the internal memory. An acceptable range for each
control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is referred to the
troubleshooting section of the owner’s manual if control results fall outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
