calcium concentration in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Serum: the total precision as well as the precision for each component of
variation (between-day, between-run, and within-run) was estimated in
accordance with CLSI Document EP5-A. A minimum of two control levels at
normal and abnormal analyte concentrations were tested. These controls were
evaluated over 20 days, two runs per day, and two replicates per run. Precision
was reported as the total percent CV.
Urine: five day precision studies were conducted on the AEROSET and
ARCHITECT c8000 Systems in accordance with CLSI Document EP10-A.
This study was intended to supplement data obtained from the twenty-day
serum precision study and provides a limited assessment of the performance
of the assay with the urine matrix. A minimum of two control levels at normal
and abnormal analyte concentrations were tested. These controls were
evaluated over five days, two runs per day, and five replicates per run.
Precision was reported as the total %CV.
The precision of the Calcium assay is < 3% total CV for serum and urine.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A minimum of nine samples at various concentrations spanning the desired
linear range of the assay were run in a minimum of four replicates. At least
one level was included which exceeded the desired linear range. The percent
recovery for each sample was determined by dividing the mean observed
result by the expected value. The sponsor’s acceptable difference between the
observed result and expected value was within ± 5% or ± 0.2 mg/dL of the
accepted values from 2 to 18 mg/dL and within ± 10% of expected values
from 18 to 24 mg/dL for serum and urine.
Data generated indicate Calcium is linear from 2 to 24 mg/dL for both serum
and urine matrices.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The reagent calibration stability was determined by the recovery method on
multiple lots of Calcium reagent. Fresh reagent was calibrated with fresh
calibrators on Day 0. Control material and a prepared test sample near the
linear high were analyzed on Day 0, 1, 7, 14, 15, 21, 29, 30, 31, and 33. The
target for % recovery was 95 to 105% of the Day 0 results. All test points up
to and including Day 33 met the target for % recovery. The resulting
calibration stability claim is 30 days.
The reagent open onboard stability was determined by the recovery method on
multiple lots of Calcium reagent. Fresh reagent was calibrated with fresh
calibrators on Day 0. Control material and a prepared test sample near the
linear high were analyzed on Day 0, 1, 7, 14, 15, 21, 29, 30, 31, and 33.
All test points up to and including Day 33 met the target for % recovery. The
open onboard stability claim is 30 days.
d. Detection limit:
To determine the Limit of Quantitation (LOQ), test levels near the linear low
for the Calcium assay were run in replicates of 10, on three instruments, two
runs per instrument. The limit of quantitation is the concentration of analyte
which has imprecision less than or equal to 20% CV. The Limit of Detection
(LOD) testing for Calcium was performed using a study design based on CLSI
protocol EP17-A. The LOQ and LOD for calcium were calculated to be 1.0
and 0.5 mg/dL, respectively. When marketed, the assay will report values
down to 2.0 mg/dL as the default setting. However, the sponsor states that
some customers may require the information on LOD and LOQ and therefore
the sponsor has elected to leave this information in the labeling.

e. Analytical specificity:
For serum samples, the sponsor evaluated the effects of bilirubin, hemoglobin,
and Intralipid. For urine samples the sponsor evaluated the effects of acetic acid,
ascorbate, boric acid, glucose, hydrochloric acid (HCl), nitric acid, and protein.
Human serum samples at the medical decision level of the analyte and urine
samples were spiked with various levels of interferents. A minimum of four
replicates of each interferent level and four replicates of reference sample were
run. The percent recovery was determined by dividing the mean result of each
interferent sample by the mean result of the reference sample. According to the
sponsor, the level of interference was considered acceptable if there was no
more than ± 5% difference between the interferent result and the reference
result. Testing was performed using the AEROSET System.
The percent interference was within ± 5% difference for serum samples
containing 60 mg/dL bilirubin; 2,000 mg/dL hemoglobin; and 500 mg/dL
Intralipid at Medical Decision Level 1 (7 to 8 mg/dL) and Medical Decision
Level 2 (10 to 12 mg/dL).
The percent interference was within ± 5% difference for urine samples
containing 200 mg/dL ascorbate, 250 mg/dL boric acid, 500 mg/dL glucose,
2.5 mL/dL hydrochloric acid (6 N), and 50 mg/dL protein.
The percent interference was > 10% difference for urine samples containing
6.25 mL/dL acetic acid (8.5 N) and 5.0 mL/dL nitric acid (6 N).
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was conducted in accordance with CLSI Document
EP9-A2. As part of these studies, a total of 10 serum samples and 7 urine
samples were spiked with calcium carbonate to generate high analytical levels.
A linear regression analysis was performed comparing the results for each
method with the following results:

b. Matrix comparison:
To establish the compatibility of specimen collection tubes with the Calcium
assay, fifteen samples were tested using each of the collection tubes to be
evaluated. The serum tube used for the baseline was the glass tube; all other
specimen tubes were plastic. The sponsor defined the acceptable differences as
± 5% or ± 0.2 mg/dL difference from the serum baseline tube, whichever is
greater. Testing was performed using the AEROSET System. Using this
criteria, comparability with the plain glass serum tube was observed for lithium
heparin (Li Hep) (with or without gel barrier), sodium heparin (Na Hep), and
Serum Separator Tubes (SST) for the Calcium assay.
