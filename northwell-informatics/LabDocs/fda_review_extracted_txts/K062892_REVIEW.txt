H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indication for use statement below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The EUKARE Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for the quantitative
measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood. Testing is done outside
the body (in vitro diagnostic use). It is indicated for use at home (over the counter
[OTC]) by person with diabetes, or in clinical setting by health care professionals,
as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control.
The measurement of glucose in whole blood can be taken from the finger only,
and this is not for neonatal use.
The EUKARE Blood Glucose Test Strips are intended to measure the glucose
levels in whole blood with the EUKARE/EUSURE Blood Glucose Monitoring
System. It is suitable for persons with diabetes to monitor their blood glucose
levels at home by themselves. The system can also be used at clinical sites by
health care professionals to test the blood glucose levels of patients.
The EUKARE Blood Glucose Control Solution level I, level II, and level III are
used as quality control material to verify the accuracy of the EUKARE/ EUSURE
Blood Glucose Monitoring System. If you are not sure about the strip quality or
the previous storage condition, you are recommended to perform a quality control
check. The control test results should always fall within the designed range listed
on the box in use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The measurement of glucose in whole blood can be taken from the finger only, and
this is not for neonatal use.
The EUKARE Blood Glucose Control Solution for use with EUKARE/EUSURE
Blood Glucose Monitoring System only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
EUKARE/EUSURE Blood Glucose Monitoring System
I. Device Description:
The EUKARE/EUSURE Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the
EUKARE Blood Glucose Test Strips, control solutions, and the EUKARE blood

glucose meter. The sample is drawn into a small chamber on the strip based on
capillary action. It will fill the chamber automatically and stop when it reaches the
end of the chamber, so sample volume control is achieved.

L. Test Principle:
The test principal is based on electrochemical biosensor technology using glucose
oxidase. The strip uses the enzyme glucose oxidase to produce a current that will
stimulate a chemical reaction with ferricyanide. This reaction is measured by the
meter and displayed as a blood glucose result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed in the laboratory with EDTA venous whole
blood. The blood glucose levels were adjusted to 5 different ranges by
spiking the sample with glucose solution (20 g/dl). Precision studies were
conducted with ten EUKARE meters and 500 EUKARE/EUSURE strips for
ten duplicates to obtain the following results (n=100 per level). All of the
tests were conducted within 30 minutes.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies were conducted in accordance to CLSI guideline EP6-P. A
venous whole blood sample was collected from a healthy person (HCT~
42%). Half of the collected sample was adjusted to about 30 mg/dl with
glucose stock solution. The other half of the collected sample was spiked to
about 600 mg/dl with glucose stock solution. Three intermediate
concentrations were prepared by combining the two spiked initial samples.
All five samples were measured by a YSI glucose analyzer for verification.
The linear regression equation for the linear regression analysis of results
from the EUKARE device and the YSI method was Y= 0.9996x-0.2571,
R2=0.9995.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Control materials are traceable to YSI standards which are traceable to NIST
SRM #965a (Glucose in frozen human serum: 4 glucose levels). Real-time
shelf life studies performed by the manufacturer indicate that control solutions
and the unopened test strips have a shelf life of 18 months. Once the control
solution or strip containers are opened, they have been shown to be stable for
3 months.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range is from 30 to 600 mg/dL (1.6 to 33.33 mmol/L). If the
blood glucose value is below 30 mg/dl, “Lo” is displayed on the screen. If the
blood glucose value is above 600 mg/dl, “Hi” is displayed on the screen. See
precision and linearity studies above for validation of the measuring range.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was conducted to determine the effect of endogenous and
exogenous substances according to CLSI EP7-P. According to this study, the
sponsor determined that acetaminophen, ascorbic acid, dopamine, bilirubin
and uric acid may lead to inaccurate glucose readings with the
EUKARE/EUSURE blood glucose monitoring system to the extent shown
below. The sponsor also determined the sodium fluoride should not be used
be used with the EUKARE Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
Acetaminophen- will interfere with test results, each acetaminophen unit
(mg/dl) will contribute about 3.86 mg/dL glucose for the EUKARE/EUSURE
strip. The labeling contains a warning that patients taking acetaminophen
should not use the meter.
5

--- Page 6 ---
Ascorbic Acid- levels lower than 1.5 mg/dl will not affect the glucose reading
of the device. However, levels higher than 2 mg/dl will interfere with the
EUKARE/EUSURE strip.
Dopamine-if a patient was treated with dopamine, the measurement results
will be increased. The labeling contains a warning that patients taking
dopamine should not use the meter.
Bilirubin- results up to 1.22 mg/dL do not interfere.
Uric Acid- concentrations higher than 7 mg/dL will have an effect on
measurements of EUKARE/EUSURE Blood Glucose Monitoring System for
the normal uric acid users.
Sodium Fluoride will interfere with the EUKARE Blood Glucose Monitoring
System. This system is for fresh capillary whole blood only.
Altitude Effect
Six glucose devices, controls (4 levels) and strips (3 lots) were tested at 5
altitudes (up to 3000 meters). No effect on performance was found when the 4
control solutions were tested up to 9842 feet (3000 meters). Higher elevations
were not tested.
Hematocrit Effect
The effect of hematocrit variation on the EUKARE Blood Glucose
Monitoring System was tested by comparing results of different whole blood
samples with hematocrit values ranging from 60% to 20% (increments of
10%). The samples were tested in replicates of four and the YSI 2300 Stat
Plus served as the reference instrument. The sponsor used the ISO 15197
document system accuracy section to validate their high percent deviations
from the average hematocrit (40%) values. The study supported a hematocrit
range of 20 to 55%.
Temperature and Humidity Effect
The sponsor submitted data to support that the test system can be used
between 56.3° -98.6° degrees Fahrenheit (12° and 37° C) and a relative
humidity up to 93%.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A clinical investigation was conducted to evaluate the system accuracy of the
EUKARE meter. 146 volunteer samples (6 were excluded due to high
hematocrit levels) consisting of 126 real samples and 20 spiked samples to
obtain higher values were tested with the EUKARE meter, EUSURE meter
and compared to YSI values. The samples ranged from 71 to 498 mg/dl and
the hematocrit ranged from 34 to 55%. The agreement of the EUKARE
capillary reading between the technician and lay user found that the lay user
variability was less than +/- 20% of the technicians obtained values. The
Error-Grid analysis to compare the capillary test result measured by EUKARE
was plotted against the EUSURE reading obtained with the same volunteers’
samples. 98% of all the data fell within the Zone A acceptance area. The
device was compared to YSI values and yielded the following regression
equation:
Y=1.0029x – 0.607
R2= 0.9941
N=146
The sponsor also conducted a consumer questionnaire to investigate the
consumers’ ability to understand the use of the EUKARE Blood Glucose
Monitoring System and strips. The results revealed a consumer average
usability score of 96% and a consumer’s ability to read and understand the
insert had a score of 98%.
