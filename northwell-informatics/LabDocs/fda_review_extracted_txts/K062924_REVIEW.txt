H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Stratus CS Acute Care CardioPhase hsCRP assay is an in vitro diagnostic
reagent for the quantitative determination of C-reactive protein (CRP) in lithium
and sodium heparin plasma. This method is for use by trained health care
professionals in the clinical laboratory and point of care (POC) settings.
In acute phase response, increased levels of a number of plasma proteins,
including C-reactive protein, is observed. Measurement of CRP is useful for the
detection and evaluation of infection, tissue injury, inflammatory disorders and
associated diseases. High sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) measurements may be used as
an independent risk marker for the identification of individuals at risk for future
cardiovascular disease. Measurements of hsCRP, when used in conjunction with
traditional clinical laboratory evaluation of acute coronary syndromes, may be
useful as an independent marker of prognosis for recurrent events, in patients with
stable coronary disease or acute coronary syndromes.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Dade Behring Stratus CS Analyzer
I. Device Description:
Each box of the test kit contains 60 TestPaks and each TestPak is comprised of
individual wells containing the following reagents: alkaline phosphatase conjugated
anti-CRP mouse monoclonal antibody, dendrimer linked anti-CRP mouse monoclonal
antibody, 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate in a diethanolamine buffer with
preservative. The device is a two site sandwhich assay based upon solid phase Radial
Partition Immunoassay (RPIA) technology.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Stratus® CS Acute Care™ CardioPhase® hsCRP TestPak

2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
k060369
3. Comparison with predicate:
The devices are identical. The only difference is an expanded indication for use
to include point of care settings.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI EP-15A User Demonstration of Performance for Precision and Accuracy;
Approved Guidelines
L. Test Principle:
The Stratus CS Acute Care CardioPhase hsCRP method is a two-site sandwich assay
based upon solid phase Radial Partition Immunoassay (RPIA) technology. In this
procedure, dendrimer linked monoclonal antibody is added to the center portion of a
square piece of glass fiber paper in the CCRP TestPak. This antibody recognizes a
distinct antigenic site on the CRP molecule. Sample is then added onto the paper
where it reacts with the immobilized antibody. After a short incubation, a conjugate
consisting of enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody directed against the same
antigenic site is pipetted onto the reaction zone of the paper. During this second
incubation period, enzyme-labeled antibody reacts with the bound CRP, forming an
antibody-antigen-labeled antibody sandwich. The unbound labeled antibody is later
eluted from the field of view of the Stratus CS analyzer by applying a substrate wash
solution to the center of the reaction zone. By including substrate for the enzyme
within the wash solution, initiation of enzyme activity occurs simultaneously with the
wash. The enzymatic rate of the bound fraction increases directly with the
concentration of CRP in the sample. The reaction rate can then be measured by an
optical system that monitors the reaction rate via front surface fluorescence. All data
analysis functions are performed by the microprocessor within the analyzer.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was previously established in k060369. In order to expand the
intended use to include the point of care setting, an additional precision study
was performed. In the additional study plasma pools were evaluated over a
period of five days by lab, emergency department, and critical care unit
personnel on the instruments located in their respective areas. The data was
calculated according to CLSI EP15-A and had within run CVs ranging from
4.0% to 8.5% and total CVs ranging from 4.6% to 8.5%. The precision results
were similar in all settings tested.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Previously established (k060369)
d. Detection limit:

f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison to a predicate device was previously performed in
k060369. In order to expand the intended use to include the point of care
setting, an additional method comparison was performed. In this study
samples were evaluated by lab, emergency department (ED), and critical care
unit (CCU) personnel on the instruments located in their respective areas. The
results are summarized in the table below.
