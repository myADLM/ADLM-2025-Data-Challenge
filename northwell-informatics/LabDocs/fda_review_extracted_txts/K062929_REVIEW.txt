H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use statement below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Quest Diagnostics Urine Cocaine Metabolite EIA is intended for the
qualitative detection of benzoylecgonine, the primary metabolite of cocaine, in
human urine on automated clinical chemistry analyzers. It is a screen test with
cutoffs of 300 ng/ml and 150 ng/ml of benzoylecgonine per ml of urine. This test
is intended for laboratory use only. For in vitro diagnostic use.
The Quest Diagnostics Urine Cocaine Metabolite EIA provides only a
preliminary result. Clinical consideration and professional judgment must
be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly in evaluating a
preliminary positive result. To obtain confirmed analytical results a more
specific alternate chemical method is needed. Gas chromatography/mass
spectroscopy (GC/MS) is the recommended confirmatory method.
The Quest Diagnostics Urine Cocaine Metabolite EIA Calibrators are intended for
medical purposes and for use only with the Quest Diagnostics Urine Cocaine
Metabolite EIA to establish points of reference that are used in the determination
of values in the measurement of benzoylecgonine in urine.
The Quest Diagnostics Urine Cocaine Metabolite EIA Controls are intended for
use as an assay quality control matrix to monitor the precision and accuracy of the
laboratory testing procedures for benzoylecgonine.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Olympus AU 5400 Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The Quest Diagnostics Urine Cocaine Metabolite EIA is a dual cutoff assay that
consists of liquid reagents, buffer reagent, controls and calibrators. This assay
contains sheep polyclonal antibodies in buffer. The tri-level controls and the
four-level calibrators are included with the device.

L. Test Principle:
The Quest Diagnostics Urine Cocaine Metabolite EIA is a competitive immunoassay
for the qualitative determination of cocaine and cocaine metabolites in urine.
Cocaine metabolites in urine and the cocaine metabolite Benzoylecgonine (BE) in the
enzyme conjugate compete for the finite binding sites of antibody in solution. If little
or no cocaine metabolite is present in the specimen, more enzyme labeled BE will be
bound and inhibited by α-BE antibody. If a large or significant amount of cocaine
metabolite is present in the specimen, less enzyme labeled BE will be bound and
inhibited, allowing greater activity and a higher signal level. The absorbance
produced is directly proportional to the amount of cocaine metabolite in the
specimen, calibrator, or control.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was assessed for cocaine cutoffs (150 and 300 ng/mL) by
conducting intra and inter-assay precision at the 0, -50% cutoff, the cutoff and
+50 % or +60% the cutoff.

150 200 200 Negative
300 200 171 Positive/29 Negative
500 200 200 Positive
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor conducted a qualitative recovery study using spiked
benzoylecgonine values that were confirmed by GC/MS as a reference. Ten
negative urine samples were spiked and run in duplicate. For the 150 ng/ml
cutoff, spiked specimens with values of 0, 75, 112, 188 and 225 ng/ml were
run in duplicate (n=100, 20 per level) For the 300 ng/ml cutoff, spiked
specimens with values of 0,150, 225,375 and 450 ng/ml were run in duplicate
(n=100, 20 per level). The results for the 150 ng/ml showed that at
concentrations of 0, 75 and 112, all 60 specimens were negative and for
concentrations of 188 and 225 all 40 specimens were positive. The results for
the 300 ng/ml showed that at concentrations of 0, 150 and 225, all 50
specimens were negative and for concentrations of 375 and 450 all 40
specimens were positive.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device has two levels of controls for each cocaine cutoff. The L1 control
must be negative and the L2 control must be positive. The sponsor has placed
in the insert the following “If control values do not fall within the established
limits above, assay results are invalid”. The supplied controls and calibrators
are prepared gravimetrically and are available from a commercially available
provider.

The sponsor conducted a stability study by comparing the performance of
reagent lots stores at 2-8 C for 3 months with that of freshly prepared
reagents. The result supported the sponsors three month stability claim.
d. Detection limit:
This is a qualitative device. See “Precision” section above and “Assay Cut-
off” section below for a summary of device performance around the cutoff.
e. Analytical specificity:
Commonly used substances
Eighty-one commonly used compounds were tested for interference with 2
pools of specimens per cutoff level: one with -50% (75 or 150 ng/ml) of the
cutoff, which was the highest concentration to consistently render negative
results and the other with +50% (300 or 600 ng/ml) of the cutoff, which was
the lowest concentration to consistently render positive results. All 81 tested
compounds exhibited no positive or negative interferences with the device.
Endogenous substances
Endogenous substances were also tested for interference on the Quest
Diagnostics Urine Cocaine Metabolite EIA. Bilirubin concentrations of up to
50 mg/L, Ascorbic Acid concentrations of up to 10,000 mg/L, Hemoglobin
concentrations of up to 1000 mg/L and Creatine concentrations of up to 5000
mg/L were found not to interfere with the device.
Cross-reactivity
A study with cocaine metabolites were tested for cross-reactivity with the
Quest Diagnostics Urine Cocaine Metabolite EIA with BE as the 100%
reference. The results are presented in the table below.

pH
Drug free urine samples were adjusted to pH values from 2 to 12. The
samples were spiked with benzoylecgonine to give final concentrations of 75
ng/ml, 150 ng/ml, 300 ng/ml and 450 ng/ml. The spiked, pH-adjusted urine
was tested with the Quest Diagnostics Urine Cocaine Metabolite EIA test.
The results demonstrate that varying ranges of pH did not interfere with the
performance of the test.

f. Assay cut-off:
Studies demonstrating assay performance around the cutoff (150 ng/ml and
300 ng/ml of benzoylecgonine) are described in the precision section above.
An additional study to challenge the sponsor’s chosen cutoff was also
conducted.
Cutoff challenge samples were prepared by spiking commercially available
BE stock into a negative urine pool. Five levels were tested for each cutoff
method. Each level was tested 20 times. Four lots of cutoff calibrators were
tested in duplicate by GC/MS to confirm analyte concentration. The results
are presented below:
150 ng/ml Cutoff
Concentration (ng/ml) Number Results
0 20 20 Negative
75 20 20 Negative

DAT II Cocaine II device and to GC/MS. The method comparison evaluation
was conducted using 153 and 165 specimens for the 150 ng/ml and 300 ng/ml
