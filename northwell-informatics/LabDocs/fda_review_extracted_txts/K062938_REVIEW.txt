I. Device Description:
Each panel contains two control wells: a negative control well, and a growth control
well (contains test medium without antibiotic). Antibiotics are diluted in water, buffer, or
minute concentrations of broth to selected concentrations prior to dehydration of the panels.
The panel is rehydrated and inoculated at the same time with 0.1 ml of suspension prepared
by the turbidity method (inoculum prepared in 0.4% saline with a very small amount (0.1%)
of Pluronic®--a wetting agent, then 0.1 ml is transferred to 25ml of inoculum Synergies plus
Pos Broth with Pluronic® for a final inoculum concentration of 3-7 X 105 CFU/ml.
Panels are incubated in a Walk-Away® System and read periodically starting at 4.5 hours
until sufficient growth to determine the MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration).
Alternately, the panels may be incubated at 35o C in a non-CO for 16-24 hours and read by
2
visual observation of growth.

L. Test Principle:
The WalkAway® SI uses a Colorimetric Optics System consisting of a color wheel/lamp
assembly and a Photosensor. There is an initial read at 2.5 hours with a possible final read at
4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 8, 12, 16 or 18 hours (overnight instrument readings, manual readings), Deleted: , or
depending on the growth rate of the organism being tested. The time of final read is Deleted: )
dependent on the user customization, the growth rate of the organism, and the sensitivity of
Deleted:
the automatic reader since cell densities below 2 x 107 cells/ml are not detected.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Data on the gram-positive panel for Nitrofurantoin at 2 – 256 µg/mL were evaluated. The
Synergies plus™ readings were obtained at times between 4.5 and 16 hours of incubation
(Rapid read method). An additional comparison was done with readings on the instrument
after 16 – 18 hours incubation for the Overnight Instrument read method, and also for the
Overnight Manual read method, when incubated 16- 18 hours and read visually.
This submission is for the AST Panel only. The ID System was not reviewed.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates tested at 3 sites on 3 separate
days in triplicate. The study included the testing on the WalkAway® SI read
at <16 hours, WalkAway® 16-18 hour readings and manual readings at 16-20 hours
incubation. The overall reproducibility results were >95% reproducible for all
reading methods.
There was a slight trend for the <16 hr Rapid reading method to produce more
susceptible results, if only by one dilution.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC isolate was tested a sufficient number of times with acceptable
results on all testing days with the reference method. The percent QC results that did
not grow in the 4.5—18 hour window was 0% for the E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and
for the S. aureus ATCC 29213.

2. Comparison studies:
The gram-positive Efficacy Study data were analyzed for Nitrofurantoin at 2 – 256 µg/mL
for enterococci and staphylococci, for which clearance is requested. Performance claims are
based on Rapid read method (<16 hours) results compared to the reference method overnight
results.
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical testing was conducted at 3 sites. A total of 576 Clinical gram-positive
isolates were tested of which 496 were fresh isolates and 80 were stock isolates.
Six (6) isolates were reported at >= 16 hours and were not included as Rapid read
results. Therefore, of the 576 isolates tested, 570 Rapid read Long Dilution isolates
were analyzed. There were 76 challenge isolates tested at one site and compared to
the reference broth dilution result mode that was determined by previous testing of
each isolate multiple times in the recommended reference panel.
The Synergies plus™ readings were obtained at times between 4.5 and 16 hours of
incubation for > 95% of the results. An additional comparison was done with
readings on the instrument after overnight incubation and also read manually when
incubated 16- 18 hours. Performance by these alternate reading methods was also
acceptable with no apparent differences or trends.
The recommended CLSI reference method was followed with the exception of the use
of a small amount (0.1%) of Pluronic® (a wetting agent) in the final inoculum. A
validation of the use of Pluronic® in the frozen reference panels was conducted.
Similar calculations for the different reading methods were performed with very little
difference.
QC was also performed with no difference apparent in the results. The chart below
demonstrates the performance of all three reading methods (Synergies plus™
readings at <16 hours, overnight on the WalkAway® and manually read at 18 hours
using the touchScan®-SR) when compared to the reference method for both dilution
sequences.
The test device had a growth rate of >95%.

EA-Essential Agreement maj-major discrepancies
CA-Category Agreement vmj-very major discrepancies
R-resistant isolates min- minor discrepancies
Essential agreement (EA) is when the MicroScan® Synergies plus panel
agrees with the reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling
dilution of the reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the
MicroScan® Synergies plus panel interpretation agrees exactly with the
reference panel interpretation. Evaluable (Eval) are results that are within
the test range and on scale.
Of the 76 Challenge isolates tested, the expected results for 62 strains were Susceptible,
13 strains were Intermediate, and 1 strain was Resistant. There were 11 minor errors
(11/76, 14.5%) generated in the Challenge Set data, using the <16 hr Rapid reading
method. All min errors were produced by Enterococcus faecium isolates. There were no
vmj or maj, and no additional minor errors were produced in the Challenge Set using the
Rapid reading method. The overall combined EA and the CA for the Clinical and
Challenge Set Data were >90% for all read methods, and the overall performance data are
acceptable.
Performance claims (in bold) that will appear in the labeling and the procedural manual
are based on the Clinical data Rapid read (<16 hour) method results only. The table
below displays the Clinical data results compared by reading method.

The Clinical data Rapid read method EA of 98.8% and the CA of 95.4% are both very
good. Overnight Instrument and Manual read methods EA and CA are both very similar
to the Rapid read method results for the Long Dilution data. There were 22 min errors
(22/570, 3.9%) produced by the Rapid read method, primarily consisting of 19 one-well
minor errors with E. faecium. This performance trend was also noted in the Challenge

Set data. The four (4) maj errors were generated by four different Staphylococcus
epidermidis isolates among the three clinical testing sites, using the Rapid read method.
The same 4 staphylococcal isolates generated three (3) maj errors using the Overnight
Instrument read method. There were no vmj produced by any of the reading methods.
There appears to be a trend for the device to produce a slightly more susceptible result as
compared to the reference method, if only by one dilution. This trend was also observed
in the reproducibility study.
The overall error rates are within acceptable limits for all reading methods. The overall
combined EA and the CA for the Clinical Data were >95% for all read methods. The
performance data are acceptable for the Long Dilution Sequence data using the Rapid
read (<16 hour) method.
