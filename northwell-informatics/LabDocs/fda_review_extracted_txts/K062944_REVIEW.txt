4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
This submission is for AST Panel only. The ID System was not reviewed.
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST
Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and
equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™
Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST broth, which contains an AST
indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST broth is a cation-adjusted formulation
of Mueller-Hinton broth containing 0.01% Tween 80. After adding the indicator solution
to the AST inoculum the color is blue and after inoculation and incubation changes to
pink then to colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds. Inoculated panels are
barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System
instrument where the panels are continuously incubated at 35oC. The AST has a final
inoculum of 5 x 105 CFU/ml. The instrument incubates, reads and records the results of
the biochemical substrates and antimicrobial agents and interprets the reactions to give an
ID of the isolate and MIC value and category interpretation of the antimicrobial agents.
Organisms growing in the presence of a given antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator,
signaling organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or
inhibited by a given antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do
not produce a color change. Additional interpretation is done using software driven
“EXPERT” System using rules derived from the CLSI documentation. Readings are
taken every 20 minutes with an AST result available between 4-16 hours. This is only an
autoread result; no manual readings are possible with this system.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
The data included in this submission were acquired during the clinical studies
performed at multiple sites and described in the previous submission for
ceftriaxone at 0.5-64 µg/ml. The accuracy performance data using ID specific
algorithm for clinical and challenge isolates of Proteus vulgaris/penneri and
ceftriaxone are contained in this submission. The Reproducibility study was
performed in the original submission and was not performed for this submission
because the drug formulation has not changed. The QC testing was performed
and was within the expected ranges as shown under the “Traceabality, Stability….
section (c)”.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intersite and Intrasite testing demonstrated >95% reproducibility. The ten
isolate study described in the guidance document was used (10 organisms
tested 3 times on 3 days at 3 sites).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality Control was performed on every test occasion with the following
results. BD Phoenix™ produced acceptable QC results >95% of the time.
The same trend for the reference result and the ceftriaxone result
demonstrated below were observed in the original clearance.

Inoculum density control: The organism suspension density of the ID
broth was equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard using the BBL™
CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer which was verified each day of testing.
Internal data was used to demonstrate that the use of the BBL™
CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer would produce reproducible results.
Five different instruments were used.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The broth dilution reference panel was prepared according to the CLSI recommendation
and used to compare with the BD Phoenix™ results. Clinical testing was performed
at several sites. The testing included both fresh clinical isolates and stock isolates
along with a challenge set with known results. A total of 78 Proteus vulgaris/penneri
isolates were tested with acceptable EA and no maj or very maj errors. Additionally,
466 clinical strains of related appropriate groups were tested to demonstrate that there
would be no difference in performance from the original studies. The following table
includes the overall performance of all appropriate organisms tested with the addition
of all previously cleared data for appropriate organisms.

performance
EA-Essential Agreement vmj – very major discrepancies
CA-Category Agreement maj - major discrepancies
R-resistant isolates min – minor discrepancies
Essential agreement (EA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panels agree with the
reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference
method. Category agreement (CA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panel result
interpretation (SIR) agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation.
Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the BD Phoenix™ and the
reference and have on-scale EA.
