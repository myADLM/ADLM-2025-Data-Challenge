This submission is for the addition of the antibiotic ertapenem at concentrations of
0.25-32 μg/mL to the gram negative susceptibility panel for testing
Enterobacteriaceae.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
This submission is for AST Panel only. The ID System was not reviewed.
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST
Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and
equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™
Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST broth, which contains an AST
indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST broth is a cation-adjusted formulation
of Mueller-Hinton broth containing 0.01% Tween 80. After adding the indicator solution
to the AST inoculum the color is blue and after inoculation and incubation goes to pink to
colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned
and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System instrument where
the panels are continuously incubated at 35°C. The AST has a final inoculum of 5 x 105
CFU/ml. The instrument incubates, reads and records the results of the biochemical
substrates and antimicrobial agents and interprets the reactions to give an ID of the isolate
and MIC value and category interpretation of the antimicrobial agents. Organisms
growing in the presence of a given antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator, signaling
organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or inhibited
by a given antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do not
produce a color change. Additional interpretation is done using software driven
“EXPERT” System using rules derived from the CLSI standards.
Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an AST result available between 4-16 hours.
This is only an autoread result; there are no manual readings possible.

Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth based microdilution method
that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance detection
of organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells
containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control
wells” which contains no antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Twelve gram-negative on-scale organisms were evaluated for site to site and
inter site reproducibility demonstrating >95% reproducibility. The ten isolate
study described in the guidance document was used (10 organisms tested 3
times on 3 days at 3 sites).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended Quality Control isolate was tested on every test occasion
with the reference method and the BD Phoenix™. When the reference
method was out of the expected range the test results were not included. The
Phoenix™ was tested a sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the
system can produce QC results in the recommended ranges most of the time.
The table below demonstrates the frequency of results at the concentrations
tested. The expected ranges are also stated.
