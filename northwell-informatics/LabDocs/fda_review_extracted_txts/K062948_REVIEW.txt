System is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test designed to detect Group B
Streptococcus (GBS) DNA from vaginal/rectal swab specimens and Lim broth

--- Page 2 ---
cultures. The test utilizes real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for a unique
gene-specific sequence amplification of Streptococcus agalactiae recovered from
clinical samples and fluorogenic target specific hybridization for the detection of
the amplified DNA.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Smart GBS™ Assay is intended for use as a method for rapid detection of
GBS colonization in antepartum and intrapartum women.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
• Prescription use only
• The use of the Smart GBS™ for intrapartum screening should not preclude
the use of other strategies (e.g., antepartum testing). Intrapartum Smart
GBS™ results are useful to identify candidates for intrapartum antibiotic
prophylaxis when administration of intravenous antibiotics is not delayed
pending results.
• The Smart GBS™ assay does not provide susceptibility results. Culture
isolates are needed for performing susceptibility testing as recommended for
penicillin-allergic women.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Automated SmartCycler DX System (instrument, computer)
I. Device Description:
The Smart GBS™ Assay contains the following reagents packaged in a test kit for
detection of GBS DNA.
1. Sample Preparation Reagent
2. Lysis Reagent
3. Treatment Reagent
4. Diluent Reagent
5. Master Mix
6. Positive Control
7. Negative Control
The SmartCycler GBS™ Assay includes all reagents described above required for sample
processing and for the simultaneous detection of the target GBS and an internal control
(IC) to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the PCR assay in order to avoid false-
negative results. The GBS primers and probe detect a unique region of the S. agalactiae
genome.
A vaginal/rectal swab is collected in Copan with Liquid Stuart Medium and transported
to the laboratory for processing. Specimens can be prepared by either using the direct
sample preparation or the enriched method. With the direct sample preparation, swabs
2

--- Page 3 ---
are eluted, lysed, centrifuged, washed, and vortexed to release the chromosomal DNA.
When using this method, testing can be completed in approximately 75 minutes where
results can be viewed with growth curves. With the enriched sample preparation method,
the swabs are placed in an enrichment broth after sample collection, and incubated
overnight (18 to 24 hours) at 37°C. Smart GBS™ can provide results the next day.
After extraction, an aliquot of the bacterial DNA is added to the reconstituted real-time
PCR reagents. Dried PCR reagents (polymerase/inhibitor complex, primers for target
and controls, Taqman probes for target and controls), dNTPs, internal DNA control are
freeze-dried on beads. The resulting mixture is placed in a reaction tube and loaded into
the SmartCycler Dx System for real-time PCR amplification and detection of target
sequences.
For quality control, positive and negative controls are provided in the assay kit. One
Positive Control and one Negative Control are processed for each assay run on the
SmartCycler Dx System. The software automatically assigns the Positive Control to the
second to last position, and the Negative Control to the last position.
External positive control monitors substantial reagent failure. The external negative
control detects reagent or environmental contamination (or carry-over) by either S.
agalactiae or GBS amplicons.
The internal control (IC) verifies functional PCR reagents and the absence of inhibition
that would prevent PCR amplification. DNA for the IC is included in one of the reagent
beads within the Smart GBS™ Assay. The response of the IC in the presence of
inhibitors correlates with the response of target GBS in the presence of inhibitors.
The controls both complement and provide a level of redundancy. Both the IC and the
external positive and negative run controls will react to degradation of enzyme because
both require its activity. All will also respond to probe degradation. Only the IC will
react to sample effects.
Before start of PCR reaction, the SmartCycler Dx System is programmed to perform an
optical measurement or probe check on the optical channels associated with GBS target
and Internal Control detection. The Probe Check control verifies reagent bead
rehydration, appropriate tube filling, probe integrity, and dye stability. Probe Check is
considered to PASS if optical measurements meet the validated acceptance criteria. If the
Probe Check fails in either optical channel, the test will not continue.
The System Control Check for Temperature Control ensures that the SmartCycler Dx
Instrument is operating within specification.
The Smart GBS™ assay is run on the automated Cepheid SmartCycler Dx System, also
referred to as the SmartCycler II, (the same instrument system as the predicate device,
IDI-Strep B Assay) consists of sixteen independently-controlled I-CORE (Intelligent
Cooling/Heating Optical Reaction) modules or sites, each of which processes one sample
at a time. Because the system controls the modules independently, different samples can
3

--- Page 4 ---
be processed using different assay definitions in the same instrument. In addition, up to
six instruments can be linked together to process up to 96 samples simultaneously.
During the amplification process, the I-CORE heater heats up and the fan cools down the
reaction tube contents. Two optical blocks positioned within the I-CORE excite the dye
molecules that make up the probes and detect the fluorescence emitted. By using probes
labeled with different fluorescent dyes, up to four dyes can be amplified and detected
simultaneously in a single reaction mixture. The optical system always collects data from
all four channels. Because the emission spectra of fluorescent dyes can overlap,
appropriate calibration and data analysis algorithms are used to separate the signal from
each of the dyes.
The thermistors used to monitor the reaction chamber temperature are calibrated to
±0.50°C using National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-traceable
standards. The optical system is calibrated using standard concentrations of the
individual unquenched dye-oligo standard to determine the spectral characteristics.
The instrument performs optics self-test before each run start to verify that the optical
system is functioning properly.
To minimize instrument maintenance, the instrument is never exposed to any fluids. All
fluids are completely contained within disposable single-use reaction tubes throughout all
the amplification process. The PCR and detection reactants and products, including
amplicons, are contained within the reaction tube to prevent cross contamination between
patient specimens.
The software (version 1.7b) controls the operation of the I-CORE module, and collects,
analyzes and interprets the acquired optical data. This software has been determined to
be a moderate level of concern. This is the same software that is used with the predicate
device, IDI-Strep B Assay.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
N/A
L. Test Principle:
The Cepheid Smart Cycler Dx System is an integrated nucleic acid amplification
and detection instrument system based on the proprietary microprocessor-controlled I-
CORE® module.
During PCR cycling, optical signals from two sequence specific fluorescent probes
within the reaction are monitored in real time. The probes correspond to the GBS target,
and the Internal Control. In the presence of DNA, this resulting optical curve consists of
a flat baseline section, a rapidly growing section, and a plateau section. The increase in
fluorescence is proportional to the amount of amplicons generated. The values for Cycle
threshold (Ct) and endpoint are used to determine the presence or absence of the GBS
target and IC being detected.
All assay data and results are stored in a database.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A panel of specimens with varying concentrations of GBS and
Lactobacillus acidophilus (negative) were tested in triplicate on 10 different days
at each of the three sites (4 specimens × 3 × 10 days × 3 sites). One lot of Smart
GBS™ kits was used at each of the 3 testing sites, according to the Smart GBS™
procedure. Intersite and intrasite demonstrated >95 reproducibility.

Stability
Stability study was performed using one lot of Smart GBS™. Reagents beads
being stored at 4ºC, 25ºC, 35ºC and 45ºC were evaluated at predefined time point
intervals up to 24 months. Additionally assay reagent pouches being stored at 5ºC (+/-
3ºC) that have been opened and re-sealed to mimic use were tested at specific pre-defined
time points.
Shelf-life for the Smart GBS™ is for a minimum of 6 months if the Smart GBS™
reagents are stored at room temperature (18-25°C) and for 12 months if the reagents are
stored refrigerated at 4°C (2-8°C).
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity was determined using 11 S. agalactiae strains
representing 9 GBS serotypes (Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V, VII, and VIII). Dilutions were made
to represent 250, 500, and 750 colony forming units (CFUs) per swab and tested in
replicates of four. Each swab was processed using the Smart GBS™ (direct method).
The lowest concentration of each subtype resulting in a positive result in all four
replicates was 250 CFU/swab as shown in the table below.

e. Analytical specificity:
Purified DNA from 101 strains representing 28 Streptococci, 73 other species
including strains phylogenetically related to Streptococcus agalactiae, other microflora
(bacteria and yeasts) commonly found in vaginal/anal flora, and human DNA were tested.
All strains were tested in triplicate at 1.5 ng per 25 µL reaction (approximately 2e5
equivalent genome copies per reaction). None of the 28 Streptococcal isolates (non-
GBS) tested positive. Of the remaining 73 strains, 4 (Enterococcus gallinarium,
Staphylococcus simulans, Micrococcus luteus and Propionibacterium acnes) were
weakly positive in one of six replicates.
Interference Testing-Endogenous Substances
Thirteen samples of amniotic fluid contaminated with meconium, blood or human
blood, human sera, urine, feces, and 2 types of lubricant were tested to evaluate the
effects of potentially interfering endogenous substances that may be present in
vaginal/rectal specimens on the Smart GBS™. All substances were tested undiluted or
“neat” at concentrations close to saturation. Results showed that high concentrations of
interfering substances, more than typically encountered in clinical specimens, did not
interfere with the qualitative interpretation of results below the LOD (e.g., all GBS
samples were still positive even though signals were reduced), except for feces. In the
presence of feces, the IC signal was reduced with up to 94% GBS inhibition which

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Double swab sets were used for clinical evaluation, for a total of 4 swabs
from each subject. For the first double swab collected, one swab was used for the
culture procedure and the second swab for the Smart GBS™. For the second
double swab, one swab was used for the Xpert GBS™ Assay and the other swab
for the predicate nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) assay. The predicate
NAAT assay targets a sequence in the cfb gene and was previously FDA-cleared
however results from this test were not used in performance estimations.

3. Clinical studies:
Performance characteristics of the Smart GBS ™ Assay were determined in
two multi-site studies. The first study was conducted at six institutions and included
intrapartum and antepartum subjects using the direct method of inoculation. The
second study included antepartum subjects only using the enriched method of
inoculation and was conducted at 3 institutions with maternity services in the United
States. Each institution had a culture-based or NAAT based screening program.
Testing was done in clinical laboratories affiliated with each institution as well as the
labor and delivery area.
To be enrolled in the intrapartum portion of the study, women had to provide
written consent, be in labor, and have no contraindication to vaginal examination (for
example, bleeding). To be enrolled in the antepartum portion of the studies, women
had to provide written consent, be at 35-37 weeks gestation, and have no
contraindication to vaginal examination (for example, bleeding). There was also no
evidence of placenta previa, no urgent indication to proceed to delivery, and no
antibiotic used in the week prior to admission for all subjects.
Vaginal/rectal specimens were collected from each of the 793 eligible subjects
in the intrapartum/antepartum study and 307 eligible subjects in the antepartum study.
In the intrapartum/antepartum study, specimens were collected using two sets of
double-marked swabs. One of the swabs from the first set was used for culturing and
the other swab was used for Smart GBS™ Assay testing by direct method on the
SmartCycler Dx System. The second set of double-marked swabs was divided as
follows: one swab was used in the Xpert GBS Assay on the GeneXpert Dx System;
the other was used in the second NAAT assay. After use in these tests, each of these
swabs was also placed into Lim culture broth, incubated, subcultured onto blood agar
plate (BAP) and observed for GBS.
In the antepartum study, specimens were collected using one double-marked
swab. One of the swabs was placed into Lim culture broth, incubated, subcultured
onto blood agar plate (BAP) and observed for GBS. A portion of the Lim culture
broth was tested by Smart GBS™ Assay using the enriched method on the

SmartCycler Dx System. The second swab was used in the secondary NAAT assay,
as described above. After use in the second NAAT assay, the swab was also placed
into Lim culture broth, incubated, subcultured onto blood agar plate (BAP) and
observed for GBS.
The reference method used was the culture technique recommended in the 2002
CDC guidelines “Prevention of Perinatal Group B Streptococcal Disease: A Public
Health Perspective” i.e., microbiological culture in selective broth medium (Lim
broth, which is Todd-Hewitt broth supplemented with 15 µg/ml of nalidixic acid, and
10 µg/ml of colistin), followed by 18-24 h incubation, and subculture onto BAP.
Specific identification of colonies suggestive of GBS was done with slide
agglutination tests.
Overall Results
The performance characteristics of the Smart GBS™ Assay were evaluated from
laboratory testing done in two clinical trials. In a trial of intrapartum and antepartum
maternity patients, 774 specimens were analyzed (409 intrapartum and 365
antepartum). In a trial of antepartum only maternity patients, 306 specimens were
evaluated. All subjects had culturing done (as described above) and most also had a
second GBS NAAT performed. The second NAAT targets a sequence in the cfb gene
and was previously FDA-cleared; results from this test were not used in performance
estimations.
Of the 793 eligible patients for the intrapartum/antepartum study, there were 723
reportable results with the Smart GBS™ assay on the first attempt (91.2%). Seventy
samples did not have reportable results (37 invalids due to failed internal control and
33 tests due to failed external control in 4 invalid runs) however, 56 of these cases
resolved upon repeat testing. Overall, 185 women had cultures positive for GBS from
the single swab used for culture. The Smart GBS™ assay yielded 151 positive results
initially (151/185, 81.6%). After repeat testing, the positive remained at 81.6%. Six
hundred three women had negative cultures and 545 were negative initially with
Smart GBS™ testing (90.4%), and 568 after repeat testing (94.2%).
The table below shows Smart GBS™ testing based on the positive and negative
GBS culture findings for 774 subjects (14 subjects had no Smart GBS™ results after
2 attempts and 5 cultures were overgrown or could not be otherwise interpreted).
Summary of results are based upon after repeat-testing. There were 14 cases that
remained unresolved even after repeat testing (n = 37).

In the antepartum study, there were 307 eligible patients. Only 306 samples were
analyzed since one sample was not provided. Of the 306 cases, the Smart GBS™
assays yielded 301 reportable results on the first attempt (98.4%). There were 5 non-
reportable results (2 were invalid due to failed internal control and 3 due to failed
external control in 1 invalid run) however all of these cases resolved upon repeat
testing. Overall, 75 women had positive culture for GBS from the single swab used
for culture. The Smart GBS™ assay yielded 74 positive results initially (98.7%)
which remained the same after repeat testing. Two hundred thirty one women had
negative cultures and 207 were negative initially with Smart GBS™ testing (89.6%),
and 209 after repeat testing (90.5%). The results of this clinical trial are summarized
in the table below.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not Applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Reported as Positive or Negative
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Positive - GBS target DNA is detected (presumptive for GBS colonization).
External Positive and Negative Run Controls are valid.
• Probe check results pass. The GBS target has a Ct within the valid
range and endpoint above the endpoint minimum setting. IC is ignored since
GBS amplification may compete with this control.
Negative - GBS target DNA is not detected (presumed not colonized with GBS),
IC meets acceptance criteria. External Positive and Negative Run Controls are
valid.
• Probe check results pass. The GBS target does not have a Ct
within the valid range and/or does not have an endpoint above the endpoint
minimum setting. The IC has a Ct within the valid range and endpoint above
the endpoint minimum setting.
Invalid - Presence or absence of GBS DNA cannot be determined. One or both
of the following may apply:
• Individual patient sample - The Target result is negative and the IC
failed. Invalid results are typically caused by inhibition of the PCR
amplification of both the GBS template and the IC.
• External Positive Control and/or Negative Control - The control did
not meet acceptance criteria. This invalidates the entire run.
ND - Presence or absence of GBS DNA cannot be determined. An I-CORE
module error was detected during analysis of sample.
No Result - Presence or absence of GBS DNA cannot be determined. This result
is reported if an insufficient number of cycles were completed, which may happen
if the test was stopped by operator before the run was completed or a power
failure occurred during the run.
When performing intrapartum testing; repeat testing may not be feasible
and will depend on practices and policies within each facility. Coordination
between clinicians and the testing laboratory is important to not delay
administration of antibiotics while results are pending.

Repeat the test if one or more of the following occurs:
• External positive and/or negative run controls have results of Invalid,
ND, or No Result. Retest the entire run with new external positive and
negative run controls.
• Individual samples (not the external positive or negative run controls)
have results of Invalid, ND, or No Result. Retest only those samples
with new external positive and negative run controls.
Approximately 10–30% of pregnant women are colonized with GBS in the
vagina or rectum. GBS colonization can be transient, chronic or intermittent. Culture
screening of both the vagina and rectum for GBS late in gestation during prenatal care
can detect women who are likely to be colonized with GBS at the time of delivery. In
various studies, sensitivities of 87% (83–92% CI) and 69% (57–79% CI) and specificities
of 96% (95–98% CI) and 92% (89–94% CI) have been reported for late-prenatal cultures
for identifying colonization status at delivery. During clinical evaluations for the Smart
GBS™ assay, 23.8% (260/1094) women were colonized with GBS by culture methods.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
