spectrophotometrically, is proportional to the rate of agglutination.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Performance was validated on a Hitachi 917 instrument.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision
Precision was evaluated for serum and plasma samples.
Serum:
Studies were performed at Seradyn and the two external laboratory sites, using the
protocol described in CLSI EP5-A2. At each of the sites, human serum-based control
samples (3 levels) and patient pools (3 levels) were run twice a day in duplicate for 20
non-consecutive days for a total of 80 replicates. The 3 human serum pools were
prepared from samples obtained from patients on lamotrigine therapy. The high patient
pool was supplemented with a lamotrigine serum drug stock in order to attain the desired
concentration. Data from Seradyn was generated using one calibration curve. Data from
external sites included multiple calibrations when needed. Each study site used the same
lot of reagents, calibrators and controls. Results are summarized below:

Serum:
The linearity evaluation for serum was performed by diluting a high patient pool to
concentrations across the assay range. The high patient pool was supplemented with
lamotrigine serum stock to achieve a final lamotrigine concentration of ~50 µg/mL. The
concentration of this serum stock was determined gravimetrically. This high
concentration pool was then diluted with QMS® Lamotrigine Calibrator A to 10 different
concentrations according to the table below. Target concentrations at each level were
determined, independently of the QMS® assay, by multiplying the high pool
concentration by the dilution factor. Each level was analyzed n=2 on each of two
instruments for a total of n=4. The average of all four replicates was used in the analysis.
Results are summarized below.

Plasma:
For the linearity evaluation in plasma, a stock of lamotrigine was prepared to a
concentration of 51.81 ug/mL(determined gravimetrically) in human plasma negative for
lamotrigine. This stock was diluted with human plasma to the concentrations shown

Spike/Recovery into Human Serum Negative for Lamotrigine:
An accuracy by recovery study was performed by spiking pharmaceutical grade
lamotrigine drug into human serum negative for lamotrigine and preparing dilutions of
this stock in human serum negative for lamotrigine. The samples prepared were at drug
concentrations across the assay range. Each sample was assayed n=3 on two separate
QMS® Lamotrigine calibration curves on two different Hitachi917 analyzers. The results
were averaged and compared to the target concentrations, determined gravimetrically,
independently of the QMS® assay. Recoveries observed ranged from 95-109%.
These linearity data, together with the results on precision and recovery at 2 ug/mL (see
detection limit, below) support the claimed assay range of 2-40 ug/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
The calibrators consist of pharmaceutical grade lamotrigine, gravimetrically spiked into
human serum containing preservatives. They are supplied in liquid form, ready for use,
for storage at 2 to 8°C. The target calibrator concentrations are 0.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0,
and 40 ug/mL.
The calibrators are gravimetrically prepared (to 4 decimal places) to attain the target
concentrations listed above. Additionally, the primary (reference) calibrator is analyzed
by a validated HPLC methodology. The reference material used by that method is ≥99%
purity. According to the manufacturer’s criteria, the HPLC results must be within +/-
10% of the target values. Instruments, programmed using nominal values, and calibrated
with primary calibrators are used to test secondary calibrators. Secondary calibrators
must then recover within +/- 10% for the average of the replicates measured, according to
the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria. Calibrators are labeled with nominal values.
The controls are labeled with the gravimetric target concentrations of lamotrigine for
each level (2, 15 and 25 ug/mL). According to manufacturer’s acceptance criteria, each
lot of controls will have concentrations verified within ±15% of target concentration. The
package insert instructs each laboratory to establish its own ranges for each new lot of
controls according to the laboratory’s Standard Operating Procedures.

Calibrator and control stability:
The manufacturer’s acceptance criteria for stability of calibrators and controls include
change in recovery, as measured by HPLC, < 10% relative to time 0. Real-time stability
studies are performed on all 6 levels calibrator material stored at 2-8 degrees C, and
opened at test intervals (6, 12, and 18 months). A minimum of six replicates are tested
(duplicates on three different curves) at each time point, and the average of the replicates
is determined. Additional manufacturer’s acceptance criteria include a stable calibrator
signal over the claimed stability time period.
d. Detection limit:
The LOQ of the assay is the lowest drug concentration for which acceptable performance
is observed. Criteria were defined by the manufacturer as ≤20% CV, with recovery ±
15% of target concentration. Two studies were performed to determine the LOQ of the
QMS® Lamotrigine Assay in both serum and plasma.
Serum:
The samples evaluated were prepared by pooling patient samples that had concentrations
at the low end of the therapeutic range and diluting the pool with QMS® Lamotrigine
calibrator A (zero calibrator) to five different concentrations. The concentration of the
100% sample was measured using the QMS® assay, and the target concentration for the
remaining samples was then calculated using the dilution factor. Each sample was run in
2 replicates per run on two different Hitachi analyzers. There were five runs per analyzer,
over five non-consecutive days, for a total of 20 replicates per analyzer (n=40). Results
are shown below:

e. Analytical specificity:
Evaluations of assay specificity were performed according to CLSI EP7-A.
The assay was evaluated for potential interference from the N-2 glucuronide, N-2 methyl,
and N-2 oxide metabolites of lamotrigine. Metabolites of >99% purity were spiked into
serum at concentrations ranging from 5-400 ug/mL. Samples were also spiked with
lamotrigine at concentrations of approximately 3 and 16 ug/mL. Control samples
contained the same concentration of lamotrigine, with no metabolite. Replicate sample
measurements (using 2 calibration curves) were obtained, with total n=6 observations.
The mean of replicates was used in calculations of cross-reactivity.
Minimal or no cross-reactivity was observed for the N-2 glucuronide and N-2 methyl
metabolites. Cross-reactivity with the N-2 oxide is shown below.

2. Comparison studies: (outliers, repeat measuremnts, graphs)
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Results obtained with the QMS® Lamotrigine Assay were compared to those obtained with
a well-validated HPLC reference method in clinical use. One hundred and sixty eight
banked samples were evaluated. Samples were evaluated at 3 sites, including the
manufacturer’s site. The samples represented approximately 138 individuals (patients
treated with lamotrigine). No specific criteria (in terms of patient demographics) were
applied in sample selection. Samples were obtained from patients in the US and Europe.
Both serum and plasma samples were included. Ten individual patient samples were
supplemented with additional lamotrigine in order that the samples would span the entire
assay range.
Samples were evaluated by the QMS® assay in accordance with the procedure described in
the proposed package insert. The same reagent, calibrator, and control lots were used at all
3 sites. The table below summarizes results provided by the sponsor, based on Passing

In addition, anticoagulant evaluations were conducted to determine sample recovery by
the assay, as well as stability. Blood samples were drawn from normal donors in various
collection tubes, including:
Potassium EDTA - both K2 and K3
Plain Serum – both glass and plastic
Serum Separator (SST)
Lithium Heparin
Sodium Heparin
Serum with Clot Activator
Plasma Separator (PST)
Samples were spiked with lamotrigine and immediately analyzed as the Day 0 value. All
samples up to day 14 refrigerated and day 42 frozen met the following manufacturer’s
criteria:
>90% recovery when compared to Day 0
±10% recovery when compared to serum (baseline)
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable. Not typically submitted for this type of assay.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable. Not typical for this type of assay.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The sponsor provided balanced and representative literature discussing
measurement of lamotrigine for clinical use.
4. Clinical cut-off:
See expected values.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
A therapeutic range for lamotrigine has not been well established. Some reports in
the literature suggest a target range for steady-state concentrations of 3 to 15 µg/mL.
However, there is not a clear relationship between lamotrigine serum concentrations
and clinical response and considerable overlap in lamotrigine concentrations has been
observed between serum responders and non-responders as well as between serum
levels associated with seizure control and adverse effects. In one study, the highest
mean serum level (trough) reported was 8.8 µg/mL, and less than 15 % of patients
reported an adverse event at serum concentrations less than 10 µg/mL. Mild to
moderate adverse effects are more commonly associated with patients with
lamotrigine concentrations above 13-15 µg/mL.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
