The Breath Alcohol Check .02 Detection System and BreathScan .02 Breath
Alcohol Detection System are in vitro medical devices that qualitatively detect the
presence of alcohol in the human breath. The test system detects equal to or
greater than 0.02 percent breath alcohol. The system is used only as a screening
device and is only an indication of the possible presence of alcohol in the blood of
the test subject.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For over-the-counter use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable
I. Device Description:
The Breath Alcohol Check .02 and BreathScan .02 Breath Alcohol detection systems
are qualitative tests for the detection of alcohol in human breath at concentrations of
0.02% and above. Each system employs the use of lot specific, one-time use
detectors, previously cleared under k060761. The detectors contain yellow crystals
that change color when exposed to alcohol vapors from human breath. The Breath
Alcohol Check .02 and BreathScan .02 electronic analyzers are used to read the
charged detectors. The internal design of the analyzers is the same with the only
difference being how the detector is positioned or inserted into the analyzer.
The test kit contains either the Breath Alcohol Check .02 or BreathScan .02 electronic
analyzer, 25 detectors (each for one-time use), and 3 plastic bags (use is optional for
the BreathScan .02 test system). The plastic bag helps ensure that adequate breath is
blown into the detector. Each analyzer is designed to be used with a specific lot of
detectors.

deep breath and blows into the detector for approximately 12 seconds, with one
continuous blow. A plastic bag, supplied with the test kit, is attached to the opposite
end of the detector. Use of the plastic bag is optional for the BreathScan test system.
The bag will fully inflate when sufficient breath has been blown into the detector.
The bag is then removed from the detector and can be retained for future use. The
detector is shaken vigorously for 2-3 seconds and then incubated for 2 minutes. The
detector is then placed in either the Breath Alcohol Check .02 analyzer or the
BreathScan .02 analyzer. The analyzer automatically turns on and reads the color of
the crystals in the detector. The crystals change to a blue-green color if alcohol is
present in the breath. Lights will flash instantaneously, with red light indicating a
breath alcohol concentration ≥0.02% or a green light indicating a breath alcohol
concentration <0.02%.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The Breath Alcohol Check .02 detection system was tested by the U.S. Department of
Transportation (DOT), National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
and was found to meet the requirements of the specifications found in the
DOT/NHTSA Model Specifications for Alcohol Screening Devices.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision and accuracy of the Breath Alcohol Check .02 detection system
was tested by DOT/NHTSA in accordance with the standard listed under
Section K of this document. The following tests were performed: 20 trials at a
Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of 0.008 and 20 trials at BAC of 0.032.
The DOT/NHTSA acceptance criteria are: not more than one positive result at
BAC 0.008 (-60% of the device cut-off) and not more than one negative result
at BAC 0.032 (+60% of the device cut-off). The Breath Alcohol Check .02
detection system had no positive results at 0.008 and no negative results at
0.032.
The precision and accuracy of the BreathScan .02 breath alcohol detection
system was tested in a “DOT-like” testing protocol by the sponsor. Forty (40)
pre-reacted detectors with simulated breath alcohol samples were tested and
included 20 tests at a BAC 0.008 and 20 at BAC 0.032. The sponsor’s
acceptance criteria are: not more than one positive result at BAC 0.008 (-60%
of the device cut-off) and not more than one negative result at BAC 0.032
(+60% of the device cut-off). The BreathScan .02 alcohol detection system
had no positive results at 0.008 and no negative results at 0.032.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable

--- Page 5 ---
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The devices are traceable to a commercially available certified alcohol
reference standard solution at a breath alcohol concentration of 0.02%. The
solution is used to calibrate the Breath Alcohol Check .02 and BreathScan .02
Breath Alcohol analyzers during manufacture.
d. Detection limit:
DOT/NHTSA guidelines do not specifically address the detection limit of
breath alcohol devices but require testing of samples at BAC 0.0 (blank
reading). The sponsor performed studies using 20 simulated alcohol-free
breath charged detectors and read the detectors with both the Breath Alcohol
Check .02 and the BreathScan .02 detection systems. The sponsor’s
acceptance criterion was none of the blank samples should produce a positive
result.
None of the 20 blank samples read by either the Breath Alcohol Check .02
analyzer or BreathScan .02 analyzer gave positive results.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed studies to evaluate the potential interference of
cigarette smoke, temperature, and vibration on results using Breath Alcohol
Check .02 and BreathScan .02 breath alcohol test systems.
Cigarette smoke: An alcohol-free volunteer was asked to smoke
approximately one half of a cigarette and then perform a breath alcohol test.
The volunteer then inhaled the cigarette four more times and performed the
breath alcohol test after each inhalation. None of the tests yielded a positive
result on either the Breath Alcohol Check .02 or BreathScan .02 detection
systems.
Temperature: The sponsor stored test kits containing Breath Alcohol Check
.02 and BreathScan .02 analyzers, breath alcohol detectors, blow bags, and
test instructions at both 10°C and 40°C. Then twenty detectors from each kit
and storage temperature were charged with simulated breath at 60% below the
cut-off and 60% above the cut-off. The detectors were then read on the
respective Breath Alcohol Check .02 and BreathScan .02 analyzers. The
sponsor’s acceptance criteria were no more than one positive result for test
samples 60% below the cut-off and no more than one negative result for test
samples 60% above the cut-off. The results are summarized in the following
table:

Vibration: The sponsor mounted test kits containing Breath Alcohol Check
.02 and BreathScan .02 analyzers, breath alcohol detectors, blow bags, and
test instructions on a shaketable or rocker for 5 minutes. Then twenty
detectors from each kit were charged with simulated breath at 60% below the
cut-off and 60% above the cut-off. The detectors were then read on both the
Breath Alcohol Check .02 and BreathScan .02 detection systems. The
sponsor’s acceptance criteria were no more than one positive result for test
samples 60% below the cut-off and no more than one negative result for test
samples 60% above the cut-off. The results are summarized in the following
table:

60% below 60% above
Cut-off Cut-off

Check .02
BreathScan .02 20/20 Negative 20/20 Positive
f. Assay cut-off:
Breath samples with breath alcohol concentration ≥0.02% will result in a red
light on either the Breath Alcohol Check .02 or BreathScan .02 analyzer.
Breath samples with breath alcohol concentration <0.02% will result in a
green light.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor conducted a consumer study to test the ability of lay users to
perform the test using only written test instructions and obtain accurate
results, when compared to a quantitative method.
Twenty pairs of adults participated in the study, one drinker and one non-
drinker. The participants were demographically diverse with respect to age,

gender, and level of education. The “drinker” ingested an alcoholic beverage
and the “non-drinker” assisted the drinker in performing the breath alcohol
test using the Breath Alcohol Check .02 and BreathScan .02 detection
systems. The “drinker” was also tested with an evidentiary method by a
trained professional.
The results of the study are summarized in the following tables:

Positive 0 1 8 11
Negative 22 3 0 0
At the conclusion of testing the study participants were asked to complete a
survey for each detection system that was used. In summary, the participants
reported that the Breath Alcohol Check .02 and BreathScan .02 detection
system instructions were easy to understand and not difficult to follow and
that the test results were easy to see and understand. All participants
understood that the detection systems were only screening tests and that
positive results should be confirmed.
