Glucose Monitoring System uses a whole blood volume of 0.7 µL. Capillary action at the
end of the test strip draws the blood into the action chamber and the blood glucose result is
displayed in 6 seconds. The control solutions available are used to test the performance of
the device.

L. Test Principle:
Glucose measurement is based on electrical potential caused by the reaction of glucose with
the reagents contained on the strip’s electrodes. The glucose in the sample is oxidized by the
enzyme glucose oxidase, and the current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured
and converted to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is
proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated the within run precision of the device using 20 replicate
measurements of 5 concentrations of glucose-adjusted venous whole blood on 5
meters each tested with 3 strip lots. Results are summarized below.

The sponsor also evaluated the between run precision of the device using replicate
measurements of glucose controls. Twenty replicates at 5 different concentrations
(30-48, 104-148, 172-243, 293-386, 413-585) and 2 levels of controls (a low ~120
and high ~270) were each tested with 3 strip lots over 10 days. Results met the
sponsor’s acceptance criteria of a standard deviation ≤ 4.5 mg/dL when the glucose
concentration was <75 mg/dL and less than a 6% CV for glucose concentrations ≥ 75
mg/dL.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To establish the linearity of the OK Meter system through the range of 15 to 598
mg/dL glucose adjusted whole blood samples were compared to YSI 2300. Linear
regression yields the following statistics:
N 20
Slope 0.991
y-intercept 5.54
r2 0.9993
The sponsor claims 20 mg/dL as the lowest detectable limit in the labeling.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The device is traceable to a laboratory analyzer which is calibrated to a glucose
standard (NIST SRM 965a). Stability characteristics of the two control solutions
were determined using real-time stability studies to determine the storage stability at
room temperature to be 18 months.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the OK Meter Blood Glucose Monitoring System is 20 - 600
mg/dL. This range was verified by the linearity study (above).
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor tested the following substances for interference using two levels of
glucose concentrations (~140 mg/dL and ~340 mg/dL). Interference was defined as
>15% bias compared to YSI. The following results were determined with regard to
interfering substances:
Substance Therapeutic/Normal Highest Concentration with
Concentration <15% bias compared to YSI
Acetaminophen 1-2 mg/mL 15 mg/dL

An altitude study was performed with 7 whole blood samples ranging from 15-600
mg/dL. The spiked whole blood samples were measured by the OK Meter 6 times
each. The samples were compared to YSI and found to have deviation less than 12
mg/dL for samples <70 mg/dL and less than a 6% CV for samples ≥70. The sponsor
claims that altitude up to 4691 feet has no effect on blood glucose measurements
when using this test system.
To test the claimed hematocrit range, 20 replicates were tested at each hematocrit
level and each glucose concentration. Samples were adjusted to hematocrit levels of
20%, 30%, 45%, 50%, and 65% and at glucose concentrations of 50, 80, 150, 300,
400, 500 mg/dL. Acceptable results were defined as 95% of samples falling into zone
A of an error grid analysis and less than 5% falling into zone B compared when
compared to a 45% hematocrit level. The performance was acceptable across the
claimed hematocrit range of 20 – 60 %.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor demonstrated that the OK Meter Blood Glucose Monitoring System for
finger stick is equivalent to a standard method (YSI-2300) by having 150 patient
samples with a hematocrit range of 35-55% test their own blood. A technician
collected blood for YSI measurement and tested using the subject meter at the same
time. Samples ranged from 71 to 414 mg/dL (according to YSI). The study results
are summarized below:

N. Instrument Name:
OK Meter Blood Glucose Monitoring System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ______
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger only. Since
the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no special handling or
storage issues.
5. Calibration:
A code number is provided with each batch of test strips to calibrate the meter for that
batch. The code number must be entered into the meter to match the number found on
the test strip vial. No further calibrations are required of the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor is providing a single level glucose control solution with this device, though
two levels are available for purchase as stated in the labeling. When a test strip is
inserted into the meter, a control can be run. An acceptable range for each control level
is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is referred to a troubleshooting section of
the owner’s manual to identify possible reasons control results fall outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
None.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
