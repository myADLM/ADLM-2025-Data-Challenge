L. Test Principle:
The IMMULITE 2000, IMMULITE 2500 Vancomycin assay is a solid phase competitive
chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay. The solid phase (bead) is coated with ligand-labeled
vancomycin. The reagent contains alkaline phosphatase (bovine calf intestine) conjugated to
monoclonal murine anti-vancomycin. Vancomycin in the patient sample competes with the
ligand-labeled solid phase for vancomycin binding sites on the monoclonal murine anti-
vancomycin enzyme conjugate. The excess sample and reagent are removed by a centrifugal
wash. Finally, chemiluminescent substrate is added to the bead and signal is generated in
proportion to the bound enzyme.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:

--- Page 4 ---
The sponsor performed precision studies based on CLSI document EP5-A2. Two
instruments were used on each platform (Immu 2000 and Immu 2500) with three different
reagent kit lots on Immulite 2000 and one kit lot on Immulite 2500. Two aliquots of each
test sample were assayed in two runs per day over 20 different days (not necessarily
consecutive) for a total 80 replicates per test sample per lot. Two controls samples and
six precision pools ( human serum spiked with vancomycin with targeted concentrations
of 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 45 µg/mL) were used. The lowest pool sample consistently read lower
than 3 µg/mL and was therefore not included in the analysis. The analysis of variance
was used to estimate the within-run and total variance of the Immulite 2000 and 2500
Vancomycin assays. Summary of the results are shown below:
For the IMMULITE 2000, maximum statistics across 3 lots using 2 instruments per lot
indicate that intra- and inter-assay CV% over the range of approximately 5 to 47 µg/mL
are not greater than 10.2% and 6.8%, respectively.
For the IMMULITE 2500, maximum statistics for one kit lot using 2 instruments indicate
that intra- and inter-assay CV% over the range of approximately 5 to 45 µg/mL are not
greater than 6.1% and 6.0%, respectively.
The package insert claims for Immulite 2000 and 2500 Vancomycin assay precision are
presented in the tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A study to evaluate the measuring range was performed on the Immulite 2000 using one
kit lot with ten serum patient samples. A serial dilution was performed with each
sample and all samples were run in triplicate. The range of the samples was 9 to 46
µg/mL. The mean result for each dilution was compared to its calculated expected value
and expressed as a percent recovery. Recovery ranged from 93 to 105%. The average
% recovery for these samples tested was 96%.
A recovery study was performed to test the ability of an assay to quantitatively recover
added analyte. Six (6) patient samples and one calibrator were spiked with various
concentrations of vancomycin on the Immulite 2000 analyzer. Recovery ranged from 93
to 110%. The average % recovery for these spiked samples was 101%.
In addition, sponsor also performed additional recovery study to confirm the manual
dilution of 1:2 can be used when result was greater than 50 µg/mL(upper reportable
range). Four samples with Vancomycin levels of 58.2, 91.9, 90.2, and 86.9 µg/mL were
diluted and the mean % recovery was 90%. Dilution recovery ranged from 80 to 104%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Immulite 2000/ Immulite 2500 Vancomycin assay is traceable to the Chemical
Reference Standard (CRS batch 2) certified by the European Pharmcopoeia Commision.
The Vancomycin adjustors, included in the reagent kit, are two levels (low and high) of
lyophilized vancomycin in a human serum/buffer matrix. Adjustors are used to correlate
the signal counts per second (CPS) of the IMMULITE platform instrument in the user's
lab to those of the Master Curve and to account for the changes in reagent enzyme
activity and/or operating conditions. In all IMMULITE platform instruments, calibrators
are used at the site of manufacture to establish the Master Curve, which is encoded in the
kit barcode label. The calibrators are not provided to the customers because the
calibration of a specific kit lot is completed at the DPC manufacturing site. Adjustors are
used to correlate the signal counts per second (CPS) of the particular IMMULITE
instrument in the user's lab to those of the Master Curve and to account for the changes in
reagent enzyme activity and/or operating conditions. The quality of the adjustment is
monitored by reviewing the slope and the intercept of the adjustment process, not the
target values of the adjustors. The acceptance criteria of the slope and the intercept are
specified in the Acceptability Criteria section in the specific IMMULITE platform
instrument Operator's Manual. Therefore, concentrations of the adjustors are not
provided to customers.
Stability of the kit: Stability testing is on-going. Results of the real-time and accelerated
stress studies support claim of 360 days shelf life for the Immulite 2000/2500
Vancomycin assay kits when stored at 2-8OC. Reagents are stable at 2-8OC until
expiration date and has an on-board stability of 90 days. Adjustors are stable at 2-8OC for
30 days after reconstitution, or for 6 months (Aliquotted) at -20OC.

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank:
The determination of Limit of Blank (LoB) was based on the CSLI guidelines EP17-A.
The guideline defines LoB as the highest value expected to be seen in a series of results
for samples that contain no analyte. 60 replicates of three zero analyte samples were
analyzed. The samples used were a zero analyte plasma sample, a zero analyte serum
sample, and the assay’s zero calibrator. The procedure was performed for three kit lots
on the Immulite 2000 and one kit lot on the Immulite 2500. The LoB was computed
parametrically as the mean minus 1.65*SD. The mean from the multiple instruments, kit
lots and samples was calculated. The sponsor claim the LoB = 0.4 μg/mL
The Limit of Detection:
The determination of Limit of Detection (LoD) was based on the CSLI guidelines EP17-
A. The guideline defines the LoD as the actual concentration at which an observed test
result is likely to exceed the LoB and may therefore be declared as detected. 5 samples
were tested and analyzed. A series of results (64) for each of the 5 samples were
generated in a total of 8 runs on 8 unique days. There were 2 replicates of each sample
per run. Two Immulite 2000 and two Immulite 2500 instruments were used in this
procedure. The LoD was estimated as LoB + 1.65*SD. The mean result from each
instrument for each sample used, for each kit lot was calculated. The sponsor claim the
LoD = 0.9 μg/mL
The reportable range for the assay is 3 – 50 μg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Potential cross-reactants were spiked at concentrations listed in the following table into a
neat normal human serum sample and a human serum sample spiked with 25 µg/mL
vancomycin. Both neat and spiked aliquots of the samples were analyzed with 2
replicates per sample. The average results were analyzed for percent interference/cross-
reactivity. This procedure was carried out on one Immulite 2000 instrument using on lot
of reagent. Results are presented below for potential cross-reactants tested in the
concentration listed:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
162 human specimens obtained from the commercial suppliers were used in the method
comparison study with the predicate device (Axsym Vancomycin II). All samples were
assayed in singlicate for 3 different kits lots on the Immulite 2000 and one kit lot on the
Immulite 2500 analyzer. Regression analyses using linear least squares correlation,
Deming and Bland-Altman difference plots were provided. Results are summarized
below:
1. Immulite 2000 Vancomycin (Y) vs Axsym Vancomycin II (X):
Linear Least Squares regression: Y= 1.02 X + 0.73; r = 0.97, n= 162. Sample
range from 3.7 to 38.6 µg/mL.
2. Immulite 2500 Vancomycin (Y) vs Axsym Vancomycin II (X):
Linear Least Squares regression: Y= 1.03 X + 0.49; r = 0.97, n= 162. Sample
range from 3.7 to 38.6 µg/mL.
3. Immulite 2500 Vancomycin (Y) vs Immulite 2000 Vancomycin (X):
Linear Least Squares regression: Y= 0.98 X + 0.17; r = 0.97, n= 162. Sample
range from 4.11 to 39.8 µg/mL.
b. Matrix comparison:
A comparison study was performed using 42 matched serum (plain and SST) and plasma
(EDTA and heparin) samples. In all 42 matched set samples, equal volumes were spiked
with various concentrations of vancomycin to obtain values from <3 µg/mL to 70 µg/mL.
Only samples within the reportable range of 3-50 µg/mL were included in the regression
analyses. Regression analyses using linear least squares correlation, Deming and Bland-
Altman difference plots were provided. Results are summarized below:
1. Serum Separator tube (SST) (Y) vs Plain serum (X):
Linear Least Squares regression: Y= 1.00 X - 0.07; r = 0.99, n= 33
2. Lithium Heparin plasma (Y) vs Plain serum (X):
Linear Least Squares regression: Y= 1.02 X + 0.03; r = 0.99, n= 32
3. EDTA plasma (Y) vs Plain serum (X):
Linear Least Squares regression: Y= 1.00 X + 0.001; r = 0.99, n= 31
