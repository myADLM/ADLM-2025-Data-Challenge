L. Test Principle:
The assays are based on the bacterial enzyme β-galactosidase
which has been genetically engineered into two inactive fragments. These
spontaneously reassociate to form fully active enzyme that in the assay formats,
cleaves a substrate, generating a color change that can be measured
spectrophotometrically.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Carbamazepine
The linearity study was performed using CLSI EP6-A as a guideline. Dilution
series were made from 7 human sera samples with low levels of
carbamazepine spiked over a measured range of range of 1.2 to 18.9 ug/mL
and analyzed on a T60 analyzer. Four parallel measurements were made in
random order. The study was performed with one reagent lot. Observed error
was ≤5.0%. The claimed measuring range is 1.0 to 19.0 ug/dL.
Valproic Acid
The linearity study was performed using CLSI EP6-A as a guideline. Dilution
series were made from 9 human sera samples with low levels of valproic acid
spiked over a measured range of range of 4.3 to 141 ug/mL and analyzed on a
T60 analyzer. Four parallel measurements were made in random order. The
study was performed with one reagent lot. Observed error was ≤5.8%. The
claimed reportable range for this assay is 3.0-142.5 µg/mL.
The package insert instructs customers to manually dilute (1:1) samples with
TDM Calibrator B0 when results exceed the measuring range.
To validate the extended measurement range for carbamazepine, the sponsor
used a high serum sample and made seven dilutions from the highest
concentration down to normal human sera. The data support an extended
range up to 37.5 µg/ml.
To validate the extended measuring range for valproic acid, the sponsor used a
high serum sample and made eleven dilutions from the highest concentration
down to normal human sera. The data support an extended range up to 282
µg/ml.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The TDM B Calibrators are purchased from another manufacturer and
relabeled. The TDM B Calibrator target values are determined using assay
specific methods on the T60. The target value is the median of all values
obtained and traceable to USP reference materials. The product stability
claims are as follows: Open vial at 2-8°C 60 days and Shelf life 2-8°C 24
months.
d. Detection limit
Carbamazepine
The lower limit of the assay (limit of blank - LOB) was determined by
assaying 24 consecutive replicates of the analyte free (0 level) calibrator on
the T60 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer. The LOB was calculated by multiplying
the standard deviation by 3 and adding it to the absolute value of the mean.
The limit of the blank was calculated to be 0.5 ug/mL.
The sponsor conducted a functional sensitivity study to determine the
concentration at which acceptable assay precision is observed. A functional
5

--- Page 6 ---
sensitivity study was performed using serum samples and the T60 Clinical
Chemistry Analyzer. The functional sensitivity was defined as the lowest
concentration that can be measured with an inter-assay CV of 20%. Serum
samples were run in duplicates of 4 and the mean and SD were calculated
based on the observed results. The sponsor claimed that the functional
sensitivity of the candidate device is 1.0 ug/mL, which is the lower limit of the
measuring range.
Valproic Acid
The limit of detection (limit of blank -LOB) was determined by assaying 24
consecutive replicates of the analyte free (0 level) calibrator on the T60
Clinical Chemistry Analyzer. The LOB was calculated by multiplying the
standard deviation by 3 and adding it to the absolute value of the mean. The
limit of the blank was calculated to be 1.3 ug/mL.
The sponsor conducted a functional sensitivity study to determine the
concentration at which acceptable assay precision is observed. A functional
sensitivity study was performed using serum samples and the T60 Clinical
Chemistry Analyzer. The functional sensitivity was defined as the lowest
concentration that can be measured with an inter-assay CV of 20%. Serum
samples were run in duplicates of 4 and the mean and SD were calculated
based on the observed results. The sponsor claimed that the functional
sensitivity of the candidate device is 3.0 ug/mL, the lower limit of the
measuring range.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed using CLSI EP7-A as a guideline. Non-
interference was defined as deviations less than or equal to
± 10% of the initial value. The results are presented below:
Carbamazepine:
Bilirubin (total): No interference found up to 58 mg/dl
Hemolysate: No interference found up to 1000 mg/dl
Lipemia: No interference found up to 1000 mg/dl
