I. Device Description:
The VITROS Rubella IgG assay and calibrators are a test system to detect antibodies
to the rubella virus, as an indicator of immunity to reinfection. The test is a standard
automated ELISA that quantitatively detects IgG antibodies in serum or plasma, by
means of binding of IgG in a specimen to antigen immobilized on a well surface. The
bound IgG is detected by a secondary anti-human IgG labeled with HRP. The bound
HRP generates a luminescent signal in the presence of substrate, and the signal is
proportional to the amount of IgG bound to the plate well. The assay is calibrated by
means of three calibrators (cleared with this submission) that are traceable to the
WHO standard reference material for Rubella IgG. The test results are reported as
International Units/mL (IU/mL) with an associated interpretation of “negative”, “low
positive”, or “positive” for the presence of anti-rubella IgG at the cut-off value of 10
IU/mL. The test results are to be used in conjunction with other clinical information
and history to suggest immune status versus rubella virus.

L. Test Principle:
The VITROS Rubella IgG assay is performed using the VITROS Immunodiagnostic
Products Rubella IgG Reagent Pack and VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products
Rubella IgG Calibrators on the VITROS Immunodiagnostic System. An
immunometric technique is used. This involves the reaction of anti-rubella IgG
present in the sample with rubella antigen coated onto the wells. After a wash step a
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled antibody conjugate (mouse monoclonal anti-
human IgG) is added and this complexes with bound anti-rubella IgG. Unbound
materials are removed by washing.
The bound HRP conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. A reagent
containing luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt) and an

electron transfer agent, is added to the wells. The HRP in the bound conjugate
catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative, producing light. The electron
transfer agent (a substituted acetanilide) increases the level of light produced and
prolongs its emission. The light signals are read by the VITROS Immunodiagnostic
System. The amount of HRP conjugate bound is directly proportional to the
concentration of anti-rubella IgG present.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated at three sites, using three master lots and four
precision pools at 4 analyte levels on three VITROS systems, based on

The assay range is 0-350 IU/mL. Assay linearity was determined based on
recommendations in CLSI/NCCLS EP6-A. Two analyte concentration ranges
were constructed from two plasma pools with IgG titers near the extremes of
the assay measurement limits that were mixed to 10 intermediate
concentrations per tested range. One range spanned the assay measurement
range, and the other was centered near the assay cut-off. The mean of each
concentration was determined using six replicates from two master lots of
reagent, and the means compared with the calculated concentrations. Linear
regression indicated that the assay is linear around the cut-off (4-32 IU/mL)
with r2 = 0.9988. Across the entire range of the assay, the results are best
fitted by second order polynomial regression with deviation from linearity in
the range 32.5-296 IU/mL equal to or less than 10.9%
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibration of the VITROS Rubella IgG assay is traceable to in-house
reference calibrators that have been value-assigned using a commercially
available assay adjusted to optimize the clinical performance of the assay.
Calibration is verified using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) low titer Rubella standard.
Shelf-life and open on-board storage stability assessments were performed for
reagents, and shelf-life and open off-board storage stability assessments were
performed for calibrators.
Shelf-life: Shelf-life testing was performed at weeks 0, 4, 9, 13, 18, 22, 26,
30, and 36 using VITROS Rubella IgG Reagent Packs and VITROS Rubella
IgG Calibrators that had been subject to simulated transport conditions of
storage at +20° C for 2 days then returned to storage at 2-8° C prior to testing.
Four runs were performed at each time point for three master lots. All tests
for all timepoints yielded results within acceptance limits, and support a 30
week shelf-life for reagents and calibrators.
Open on-board storage: Open on-board storage stability was assessed at
weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks using 3 lots and four runs per lot at each time
point, with reagents that had been subjected to simulated transport conditions
and returned to storage at 2-8° C. Fresh reagents were tested at weeks 0 and
12. Reagent Packs were stored under simulated use conditions (stored in
system Environmental Chamber, with warming to room temperature for >30
min on 6 separate occasions) for duration of the testing. All results for each
time point were within acceptance limits, and support an on-board storage
period of 12 weeks with typical Reagent Pack use.
Open off-board storage of calibrators: Off-board storage of calibrators was
6

--- Page 7 ---
assessed at storage temperatures 2-8° C and -20° C, at 0, 5, 10, and 13 weeks
using pooled calibrators and three reagent kit lots and four runs per lot at each
time point. Reagent Packs and calibrators were subjected to simulated
transport conditions and returned to storage at 2-8° C prior to testing. Each
run included singleton determinations of fresh, and pooled and stored
calibrators (2-8° C and -20° C). All results were within acceptance limits, and
support an open off-board storage at 2-8° C or -20° C for up to 13 weeks.
Sample stability was examined using matched samples drawn in serum glass,
EDTA, heparin, and citrate plasma tubes from 9 IgG-positive donors and one
IgG-negative donor. Samples were assayed fresh, after 5 and 7 days storage
at 2-8° C, and after 4 weeks at -20° C. Three singleton determinations were
made with one master lot of reagents, and the other 6 determinations were
made with a different master lot on a second VITROS instrument. Three
determinations for each sample type and storage condition were made. The
table below shows the results for the IgG positive samples. There was no
storage effect on the IgG negative samples.

d. Detection limit:
The detection limit of the assay is nominally 0 IU/mL. Performance data
support a lower limit of linearity of 4 IU/mL. Two specimen pools with
concentration = 4IU/mL were each tested 16 (pool 1a) or 20 (pool 1b) times,
using two reagent lots.

specimens containing potentially cross-reacting subgroups, and by testing of
specimens spiked with various potentially interfering substances.
Cross-reacting subgroups: 177 patient samples were determined in singleton
using the VITROS Rubella IgG assay and the Abbott AxSym Rubella IgG
assay, using 2 master lots of VITROS reagents and 2 VITROS instruments.
Results were compared for agreement. Twenty-four of 177 samples were
negative for IgG in both tests. 138 samples were positive in both tests.
Eleven samples were positive or equivocal with AxSym and negative with
VITROS. ANA/SLE was slightly over-represented in the discordant group.
No evidence of specific cross-reactivity was seen.

each sample (non-hemolysed) and to various levels of hemoglobin (5.0, 2.5,
1.1, 0.5 g/L) were added to additional aliquots. Each prepared sample was
analyzed in singleton, and % difference of samples with added hemoglobin
compared to non-hemolyzed samples was determined. The following table
contains results from bias calculations using only the highest level of
hemoglobin (500 mg/dL). The mean percent differences for the two lots were

b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison samples were prepared from matched samples drawn from
5 rubella IgG-positive donors and one rubella IgG-negative donor. Positive
samples were diluted with negative serum to generate serum test samples with
IgG concentrations near the cut-off of 10 IU/mL. Negative samples were also
spiked with positive samples to achieve concentrations near the cutoff.
Matrices tested were heparin, EDTA, and sodium citrate plasma, and standard
(glass-collected), SST, and silicon-coated serum tube samples. SST-collected
serum samples were tested when serum was withdrawn within 24 hr and
within 48 hr of specimen collection. Results from all matrix types were
compared to glass-collected serum. Each sample was determined in triplicate,
spit over two VITRO instruments and two reagent lots

An additional study was performed to further examine the effect of sodium
citrate on assay performance, using fourteen samples generated by blending of
positive and negative serum and citrate plasma to generate samples with IgG
values near the cut-off. Values shown below are the measured increase in IgG
as a result of subtracting the sample value after spiking from the sample value
prior to spiking (result increase).

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Percent positive and percent negative agreement with a predicate device
(Abbott AxSYM Rubella IgG assay) was determined in two studies.
Study 1: A total of 871 prospectively collected, random clinical samples,
including women of child-bearing age, healthcare workers, and people being
screened for rubella infection were tested at three clinical sites in Europe. 295
were from Site 1 (France), 276 from site 2 (Netherlands), and 300 were from
site 3 (Netherlands). Each sample was tested in singleton on each system
(VITROS and AxSYM). The VITROS Rubella IgG assay classifies samples
with IgG values > 10 IU/mL as positive, and values < 10 IU/mL as negative.
The AxSYM Rubella IgG assay classifies samples with IgG values > 10
IU/mL as positive, values > 5 but < 10 IU/mL as equivocal, and values < 5
IU/mL as negative.
Of the samples tested, 70 (8%) were negative and 801 (92.0%) were positive
for rubella IgG.
Agreement was calculated with and without equivocal results.

* Overall percentage agreement calculated using the total number of samples
measured, excluding those that read equivocal in the AxSYM assay.
Positive and negative agreement rate was similar between sites.
Study 2: A total of 572 blinded, randomized positive and negative
retrospective frozen clinical samples from US sample suppliers were tested at
two sites (300 samples at site 1 and 292 samples at site 2) in singleton on each
system (VITROS and AxSYM). Sample status was confirmed by vendors
prior to the study.The VITROS Rubella IgG assay classifies samples with IgG
values > 10 IU/mL as positive, and values < 10 IU/mL as negative. The
AxSYM Rubella IgG assay classifies samples with IgG values > 10 IU/mL as
positive, values > 5 but < 10 IU/mL as equivocal, and values < 5 IU/mL as
negative.
Of the samples tested, 224 (37.8%) were negative and 868 (62.2%) were
positive for rubella IgG.
Agreement was calculated with and without equivocal results.
