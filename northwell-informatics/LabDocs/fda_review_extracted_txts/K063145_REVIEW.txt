L. Test Principle:
The Phenytoin assay is based on the bacterial enzyme beta-galactosidase, which has
been genetically engineered into two inactive forms. The fragments spontaneously
reassociate to form fully active enzyme that, in the assay format, cleaves a substrate,
generating a color change that b ace measured spectrophotometrically. In this assay,
analyte in the sample competes with analyte conjugated to one inactive fragment of
beta-galatosidase for antibody binding sites. If analyte is present in the sample, it

binds to the antibody, leaving the inactive enzyme fragments free to form active
enzyme. If analyte is not present in the sample, antibody binds to analyte conjugated
on the inactive fragment, inhibiting the reassociation of inactive beta-galatosidase
fragments, and no active enzyme is formed. The amount of active enzyme formed
and resultant absorbance change are directly proportional to the amount of drug
present in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor conducted precision studies for phenytoin according to EP5-A
using two reagent lots on three T60 analyzers. Serum samples were run for 21
days (two replicate runs per day) at one site (n=84). The results are
summarized in the following table.
Precision Study Phenytoin
Low mean High mean
8.6 µg/ml 20.0 µg/ml
SD CV% SD CV%
Within run 0.20 2.4 0.32 1.6
Between run 0.15 1.7 0.23 1.2
Total 0.39 4.5 0.59 3.0
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor’s phenytoin linearity study was conducted based on EP6-A.
Linearity was conducted on two sets of samples. The first series was a
dilution of low patient serum spiked with phenytoin (~50 ug/mL). The second
series was a dilution of the TDM calibrators B-0 with low patient serum,
spiked with phenytoin (to ~ 50 ug/mL). Four parallel measurements were
made that spanned from 0.8 – 38 ug/mL. The sponsor results support the
measuring range of 0.8 ug/ml to 38.0 ug/ml.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The TDM B Calibrators are purchased from another manufacturer and
relabeled. The TDM B Calibrator target values are determined using assay
specific methods on the T60. The target value is the median of all values
obtained and traceable to USP reference materials. The product stability
claims are as follows: Open vial at 2-8°C 60 days and Shelf life 2-8°C 24
months. Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and
found to be acceptable.

d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) of the T60i Phenytoin was determined with 24
replicates of TDM Calibrator B-0 solution. LoB was determined from the
mean plus 3 SD. The results indicate that the T60i Phenytoin LoB is 0.4
ug/ml.
The measuring range of the assay is 0.8 – 38.0 μg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The specificity of T60i Phenytoin for some structurally similar compounds
and related compounds that may be found in serum were evaluated in a cross
reactivity study. A drug free sample was spiked with varying concentrations
of interferent. The actual dose of phenytoin was calculated as the dose of the
interfered sample minus the dose of the blank. The following percent cross-
reactivity equation was used: Testing result/spiked concentration multiplied
by 100.
