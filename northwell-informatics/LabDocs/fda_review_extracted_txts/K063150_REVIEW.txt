L. Test Principle:
For both C3 and C4 Assays, the method is immunoturbidimetry enhanced by
polyethylene glycol (PEG). Specific antiserum is added in excess to buffered
samples. The increase in absorbance caused by immunoturbidimetry is recorded
when the reaction has reached its endpoint. The change in absorbance at 340 nm is
proportional to the amount of C3 or C4 in solution.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Specical calibrator is standardized against the primary reference material
CRM 470 – CAP/IFCC (International Federation of Clinical Chemistry).
d. Detection limit:
The “determination limit” was defined as the lowest concentration that can be
measured quantitatively. Additional linearity studies were performed to
determine the lowest levels that could be measured with a maximum bias of ±
10%. For C3 it was determined to be 15 mg/dL and for C4 it was 2 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The interference studies were performed using CLSI document EP7-A as a
guideline. In paired-difference testing, both control and test pools were
analyzed, with four replicates from each pool, within one analytical run.
Samples for C3 and C4:
Three levels of analyte.
Low level sample: normal human sera diluted with Specimen Diluent.
Medium level sample: normal human sera.
High level sample: normal human sera spiked with C3 or C4 preparate.

C3 and C4 lipemia (Intralipid®) interference studies were performed using a
dose response method.
C3:
Three samples containing different levels of C3 were tested by adding a series
of lipid concentrations from 0 – 1000 mg/dL. The clinically significant bias
(mg/dL) was established for each level of C3. The claim for the assay is “No
interference found up to 500 mg/dL of Intralipid®.

g. Hook effect (antigen excess):
Four parallel measurements were made in random order. The test sample
series were made from C3 or C4 spiked normal level human serum. The
values of the highest samples were 949 mg/dL for C3 (upper end of the
measuring range 513 mg/dL) and 419 mg/dL for C4 (upper end of the
measuring range 103 mg/dL). Primary and secondary dilutions are
automatically made by the instrument. Results for sample concentrations
greater than the secondary dilution limit are shown to the user as ‘Test limit
high’ and the user may manually request a further dilution. Whenever manual
acceptance is required, the result will not be printed or transmitted via LIS if
not accepted by the user.
