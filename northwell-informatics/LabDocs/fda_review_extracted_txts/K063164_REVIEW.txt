1. Indication(s) for use:
VITROS Chemistry Products THC Reagent: For in vitro diagnostic use only.
VITROS Chemistry Products THC Reagent is used on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry
Systems for the semi-quantitative or qualitative determination of cannabinoids
(THC) in human urine using a cutoff of either 20 ng/mL or 50 ng/mL.
Measurements obtained with the VITROS THC method are used in the diagnosis
and treatment of cannabinoid use or overdose.
The VITROS Chemistry Products THC assay is intended for use by professional
laboratory personnel. It provides only a preliminary test result. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used to confirm a result obtained with this
assay. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred
confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
applied to any drug of- abuse test result, particularly when evaluating a
preliminary positive result.

I. Device Description:
The VITROS THC assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay that is
performed using the VITROS THC Reagent with the VITROS Calibrator Kit 30,
VITROS FS Calibrator 1 and VITROS FS Diluent Pack 4 (DAT Diluent / DAT
Diluent 2) on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems. The VITROS THC Reagent is
a dual chambered package containing ready-to-use liquid reagents that are used to
detect cannabinoids in urine. Sample, calibrators, and controls are automatically
treated with surfactant (DAT Diluent 2) prior to addition of reagents. Treated
sample is added to Reagent 1 containing antibodies reactive to delta-9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), glucose-6-phosphate and nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), followed by Reagent 2 containing delta-9-THC
labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH). The
assay is based on competition between delta 9-THC metabolites in the treated
urine sample and the delta 9 -THC labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6P-DH) for antibody binding sites. Enzyme activity decreases
upon binding to the antibody, therefore the concentration of delta-9-THC
metabolites in the urine sample is directly proportional to measured enzyme
activity. Active enzyme converts oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD+) to NADH, resulting in an absorbance change that is measured
spectrophotometrically at 340 nm.
VITROS Calibrator Kit 30 is prepared from human urine to which analyte,
surfactant, and preservatives have been added. The VITROS FS Calibrator 1 is
composed of processed water and 0.9% w/v sodium chloride (Saline). These
calibrators are used to calibrate VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems for the
qualitative or semiquantitative measurement of cannabinoids (THC).

VITROS DAT Performance Verifiers I, II, III, IV and V are prepared from a
human urine pool to which analytes, surfactant, and preservative have been added.
These are assayed controls used to monitor performance of the VITROS THC
assay on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The evaluation was conducted on the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System on
each of 22 calendar days using three lots of reagents on two different systems.
Each run consisted of seven control fluids to challenge system precision at
approximately ± 25% of the cut-off values (20 and 50 ng/mL), at the cut-off
values, and at a high THC level (75 ng/mL). Control fluids are drug-spiked,
pooled human urine with concentrations verified by GC/MS. Four
calibrations were performed over the 22-day testing period. Multiple runs
within a day were separated by at least two hours. All fluids were run in
duplicate in each run. Final results and the calculation of within lab
imprecision are based on weekly calibrations.
The results of the test samples were analyzed by ANOVA as detailed in
NCCLS EP5-A2. The mean within lab CV of the three lots tested was 3.5%
(range 1.7 – 9.0%).
Qualitative precision was estimated by determining the percentage of negative
controls that produced a negative result versus the cutoff value and the
percentage of positive controls that produced a positive result versus the
cutoff value.
Cut-off Number Correct
Cut-off Confidence Level
Level Tested Results
20 ng/mL 0.75x 262 262 > 95% negative reading
20 ng/mL 1.25x 264 263 > 95% positive reading
50 ng/mL 0.75x 264 264 > 95% negative reading
50 ng/mL 1.25x 264 264 > 95% positive reading
One result pair (0.75x) 20ng/mL cutoff was excluded because the wrong fluid was tested.
The results demonstrated acceptable imprecision on the VITROS THC
Reagent lots and VITROS 5,1 FS Systems evaluated.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range of the assay is from 5.0 to 80 ng/mL. A linearity study
was performed according to NCCLS EP6-A. Urine pools containing low and
high concentrations of 11-nor-delta-9-THC-9-COOH were mixed together
resulting in 16 samples with 11-nor-delta-9-THC-9-COOH concentrations that
spanned the measuring range of the assay. The linearity was evaluated with
multiple reagent lots and assessed by comparing the measured VITROS THC
assay values against the percent high pool to determine if the data conformed
to a straight line. The linear regression calculations gave R2 values of 0.999
and all samples were within the acceptance criteria when measured results

were compared to expected results across the sample range tested (2.5 – 82.5
ng/mL).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The values assigned to the VITROS calibrators and controls for 11-nor-delta-
9-THC-9-COOH are traceable to NIST standard SRM 1507b, verified by
GC/MS.
Working Calibrators that are value assigned by a GC/MS method with
reference to NIST SRM 1507b are used to assign values to master calibrators
using the Vitros 5,1 Chemistry system. These master calibrators are then used
to assign values to final product calibrators. Controls are manufactured and
verified by GC/MS traceable to NIST SRM 1507b. Final control values are
assigned using the Vitros 5,1 Chemistry system. Real time stability studies
are used to support both long term and open vial storage dates.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LOB), Limit of Detection (LOD) and Limit of
Quantitation (LOQ) were determined following NCCLS EP17-A. The Limit
of Blank, Limit of Detection and Limit of Quantitation were calculated for
three reagent lots and determined to be 1.7 ng/mL, 4.9 ng/mL, and 5.0 ng/mL,
respectively. The limit of quantitation is used when determining the reportable
range of the assay.
e. Analytical specificity:
Determination of Cross-reactivity
Cross-reactivity was examined by adding potential cross-reactant compounds
into a drug free calibrator. The compounds were evaluated using the VITROS
5,1 FS Chemistry System to determine the VITROS THC Assay value
equivalent to that of the calibration 11-nor-delta-9-THC-9-COOH analyte, at
the cutoff values of 20 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL. Screened compounds exceeding
the cutoff responses were further diluted with drug free calibrator to determine
the approximate compound concentration required to generate a VITROS
THC Assay value equivalent to 11-nor-delta-9-THC-9-COOH at the cutoff
values.

Exogenous Compounds
Exogenous compounds were evaluated with a single test fluid spiked with the
featured compound at a high concentration level (100,000 ng/mL). These
compounds were spiked into commercially available calibrators with THC
concentrations of 20 ng/mL or 50 ng/mL. Exogenous compounds
demonstrating biases that exceeded the acceptance criteria were considered to
interfere with the VITROS THC Assay at the cutoff value tested. When
interference was observed, on-board dilutions of the test fluid were performed
to estimate the highest interferent concentration that did not exceed the
acceptance criteria at the cutoff value.

Endogenous Compounds
Solutions for the evaluation of potential endogenous interferents were
prepared by addition of endogenous compounds a commercial calibrator
containing THC. The test fluids and their control blanks were run on a
VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry. The effects of variations in pH were tested by
adjusting the calibrator pH. Endogenous compounds demonstrating biases
that exceeded the acceptance criteria were considered to interfere with the
VITROS THC Assay for the appropriate cutoff value tested. When
interference was observed, on-board dilutions of the test fluid were performed
to estimate the highest interferent concentration that did not exceed the
acceptance criteria at the cutoff value.
