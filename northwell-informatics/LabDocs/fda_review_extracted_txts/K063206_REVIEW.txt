L. Test Principle:
Bound homocysteine in the sample is reduced to free homocysteine by the action of
dithiothreitol, and converted enzymatically to S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH) in the next
step. Conjugated S-adenosyl-cysteine (SAC) added at the onset of the reaction competes with
the SAH in the sample for bonding by anti-SAH antibodies bound to polystyrene particles. In
the presence of SAH there is either no aggregation or a weaker aggregation of the
polystyrene particles. In the absence of SAH in the sample an aggregation of the polystyrene
particles by conjugated SAC occurs. The higher the SAH content of the reaction mixture, the
smaller the scattered light signal. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of
known concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated with quality control materials (L, M, H), a plasma pool and
two serum pool on the Dimension Vista System following CLSI EP5-A2 guideline.
Samples were analyzed in duplicate, twice a day, for 20 days. The repeatability and
within-lab SD and % CV were calculated by the analysis of variance method. The
data are summarized in the table below:
Material Mean Repeatability Within-Lab

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the assay range was determined by testing a calibrator and a high
patient serum with a high concentration of homocysteine. The samples were serially
diluted with system diluent and each dilution was tested with replicates of three. Data
were analyzed using linear regression analysis. The acceptance criteria of slope
between 0.9 and 1.1 and correlation coefficient ≥ 0.95 was met for the study.
The reportable range for the assay is 2 – 57 μmol/L.
The sponsor recommends a dilution of 1:10 when patient result falls outside the upper
measuring range of 57μmol/L. A dilution study for homocysteine was performed on
8 different patient serum spiked with homocysteine on the Dimension vista system.
Each sample was then diluted with system diluent at 1:10 dilution by the analyzer or
manually. Each diluted sample was run in replicates of 5. The % recovery of the
Dimension vista system for homocysteine assay ranged from 91% to 100.7 % with a
mean % recovery of 94%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and value assignments:
The PROT1 calibrators and PROT1 controls are calibrated against an internal master
calibrator, which is calibrated against a commercially available reference preparation.
Specifically, homocysteine is calibrated against a commercially available preparation
of purified S-adenosyl-homocysteine. The value assignment process for the standard
and control are by an internal protocol using two different instruments and by
performing multiple determinations using the Dimension Vista Systems and the
Dimension HCYS Reagent. The PROT1 calibrators and PROT1 controls are traceable
to purified S-adenosyl-homocysteine.
Stability:
To support a 24 month shelf-life for unopened Dimension Vista HCYS flex reagent,
PROT1 calibrators and PROT1 controls store at 2-8oC, testing was done on day 0 and
after 12, 18, and 24 months. The acceptance criteria are: results obtained must be
within a range of 85% to 115% of the control assigned value.
To support an open-vial stability at 2-8oC for the Dimension Vista HCYS flex
reagent, PROT1 calibrators and PROT1 controls, vials are stored on board the
instrument and contents are tested in duplicates on day 0, 4, 7, 9, 11, 14. The
acceptance criteria are: results obtained must not deviate more than ± 10% compared
to day 0 results. The sponsor claims the on-board stability of 9 days for the
calibrators and controls once the vial is opened. The open well stability of the HCYS
Flex reagent cartridge is 21 days for wells 1-12. Sealed wells on the instrument are
stable for 30 days.

d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity is defined as the minimal detectable level of analyte, which
can be distinguished from zero. The value was calculated as the mean value of
twenty replicates of system diluent plus two standard deviations. The sponsor claims
the analytical sensitivity to be 0.2 µmol/L.
The reportable range for the assay is 2 – 57 μmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
The HCYS method was evaluated for interference according to CLSI/NCCLS EP7-A2. Bias
is the difference in the results between the control sample (without the interferent) and the
test sample (contains the interferent) expressed in percent. Bias exceeding 10% is considered
interference.

As limitations, the applicant stated the followings in the package insert:
1. Specimens from patients who are on drug therapy involving S-adenosy-
methionine may show falsely elevated levels of homocysteine. Certain drugs,
such as antiepileptic, antifolates, nitrous oxide anesthesia and antagonists of
vitamin B6 are known to elevate the homocysteine concentration in human blood.
2. Patient samples may contain heterophilic antibodies that could react in
immunoassays to give falsely elevated or depressed results. This assay has been
designed to minimize interference from heterophilic antibodies. Nevertheless,
complete elimination of this interference from all patient specimens cannot be
guaranteed.
f. Assay cut-off:
None
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed on 215 matched samples of serum,
EDTA plasma, and heparized plasma based on the CLSI EP9-A2 guideline on the
Dimension Vista system and the BN ProSpec system. Samples concentration range
from 3.43 to 56.52 µmol/L. The method used to fit the linear regression line was
Passing Bablok. Regression analysis of these results yielded the following equation:
Y = 1.056 X + 0.239, r= 0.995, N=215. Y = Dimension Vista HCYS assay, and X =
BN ProSpec N Latex HCY assay.

matched specimens of serum, EDTA, and lithium and sodium heparin plasma on the
Dimension Vista system. Linear regression analysis showed correlations of slopes of
0.9 to 1.10 and r ≥ 0.95 was met when different matrices were compare to the serum
sample.
