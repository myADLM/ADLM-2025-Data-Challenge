L. Test Principle:
The ARCHITECT Intact PTH assay is a two-step sandwich immunoassay for the
quantitative determination of intact PTH in human serum and plasma using
chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology.
In the first step, sample, assay diluent, and anti -PTH coated paramagnetic
microparticles are combined. Intact PTH present in the sample binds to the anti-PTH
coated microparticles. After washing, anti-PTH acridinium-labeled conjugate is added
to create a reaction mixture in the second step. Following another wash cycle, pre-
trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting
chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs).
The ARCHITECT Intact PTH can be used with both STAT and Routine Protocols.
The STAT protocol has a shorter incubation time in comparison to the Routine
protocol. Routine and STAT protocols require separate calibrations due to different
incubation time but require only one reagent kit.
A direct relationship exists between the amount of intact PTH in the sample and the
RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT i System optics.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A study was performed for the ARCHITECT Intact PTH assay, based on
guidance from the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Protocol
EP5-A. Multiple ARCHITECT Intact PTH control lots were assayed using
two lots of reagents in replicates of two at two separate times per day for 20
days at one site on two instruments using the STAT protocol and at a second
site on two instruments using the Routine protocol.
In addition, a second precision study was performed, where two lots of
reagents were assayed in four replicates per run at two separate times per day
over 10 days on one instrument at a third site using the STAT protocol and on
one instrument at a fourth site using the Routine protocol. Each reagent lot
used a single calibration curve throughout the study. Data from both studies
are summarized in the following tables.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators and controls are manufactured using Human Parathyroid Hormone
and are traceable to WHO International reference preparation of Parathyroid
Hormone, Human, for Immunoassay code: 79/500.
Value assignments and verification processes for ARCHITECT Intact PTH
calibrators and controls are done using an internal protocol.
A study was conducted to determine the shelf-life integrity of the
ARCHITECT Intact PTH Reagent Kit, Calibrator, and Controls when stored
at the recommended storage condition of 2 to 8°C.
A real-time stability study supports a shelf life of 13 months for the
ARCHITECT Intact PTH Reagent, Calibrator, and Control kit at the
recommended storage condition of 2 to 8°C. The expiration date of 12 months
is being assigned for the ARCHITECT Intact PTH Reagent, Calibrator and
Control kit.
d. Detection limit:
A study was performed using human samples with concentrations targeted at
3 pg/mL, 4 pg/mL and 5 pg/mL of intact PTH. Those samples were tested in
replicates of two over 10 days using two reagent lots on two instruments using
the STAT protocol and on one instrument using the Routine protocol.
Functional sensitivity (lowest concretion with a CV ≤ 20%) was determined to
be = 3 pg/mL for the Routine protocol and = 4 pg/mL for the STAT protocol.

Interference studies
Potential interference in the ARCHITECT Intact PTH assay from hemoglobin,
bilirubin, triglycerides, and protein at the levels indicated below. Interference
was demonstrated by a study based on guidance from the Clinical Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) Protocol EP7-A. There was no significant
interference observed. Data from this study are summarized in the following
table.

Triglycerides 5000 mg/dL 105
Protein low 4 g/dL 106
Protein high 9.5 g/dL 93
Protein high (Routine protocol) 10.5 g/dL 94*
When using the STAT protocol, interference with high levels of protein may
be observed.
Limitations to the procedure
The applicant states Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with
reagent immunoglobulins, interfering with in vitro immunoassays. Patients
routinely exposed to animals or to animal serum products can be prone to this
interference and anomalous values may be observed. Additional information
may be required for diagnosis. The ARCHITECT Intact PTH assay has not
been clinically validated for intra-operative use.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
A reference range study was conducted with USA population samples, testing a
total of 168 samples from apparently healthy adults. These samples gave the
values summarized in the following table.
Intact PTH (pg/mL)
N Median 2.5th percentile 97.5th percentile
STAT Routine STAT Routine STAT Routine
Healthy Adults 168 27.2 28.9 8.5 8.7 72.5 77.1
A reference range study was conducted with European population for the
ARCHITECT Intact PTH assay to establish the reference range from apparently
healthy adults. Data from this study are summarized in the following table.
Intact PTH (pg/mL)
N Median 2.5th percentile 97.5th percentile
STAT Routine STAT Routine STAT Routine
Healthy Adults 143 37.25 35.70 15.64 14.04 69.95 67.84
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
