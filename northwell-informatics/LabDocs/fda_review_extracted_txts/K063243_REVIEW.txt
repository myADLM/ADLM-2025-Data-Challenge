L. Test Principle:
The VIDAS Troponin I Ultra (TNIU) Assay is one-step, sandwich enzyme-linked
fluorescent immunoassay (ELFA) performed with an automated VIDAS or a
miniVIDAS instrument. A pipette tip-like disposable device, the Solid Phase
Receptacle (SPR), serves as the solid phase as well as a pipettor for the assay.
Reagents for the assay are pre-dispensed in the sealed TNIU Reagent Strips.
All assay steps and assay temperatures are controlled by the instrument. The sample
is transferred into the wells containing the conjugate (alkaline phosphatase-labeled

mouse monoclonal anti-cardiac troponin I antibody). The sample and conjugate
mixture is cycled in and out of the SPR several times. Unbound sample is removed
from the SPR during the wash step. During the detection step, the fluorescent
substrate (4-Methyl-umberlliferyl phosphate) is cycled in and out of the SPR. The
conjugate enzyme remaining in the SPR catalyzes the hydrolysis of the substrate into
a fluorescent product 4-methylumbellferone. Fluorescence is measured at 450 nm
wavelength by the optical scanner in the instrument. The intensity of the fluorescence
is directly proportional to the concentration of analyte present in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was performed over a period of 10 days, 2 runs per day
with 2 reagent lots and 3 test sites (n=240). The repeatability, inter-lot
reproducibility, and inter-site reproducibility were calculated based on CLSI
EP5-A2. Samples with TnI concentration at 4 different levels were tested
(0.58, 3.55, 6.66, and 17.05 ng/mL). Repeatability ranged from 1.28-2.7% co-
efficient of variation (CV), inter-lot reproducibility ranged from 3.4-6.61%
and inter-site reproducibility ranged from 3.74-7.86% CV.
A Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) study was performed as part of the same study
to determine the lowest concentration of TnI that corresponded to a 10% CV.
Four samples were tested in duplicate, 2 runs per day, for 10 days with 2 kit
lots and across 3 testing sites (n=240). The LoQ was determined to be 0.11
ng/mL and corresponds to a coefficient of variation (CV) of approximately
10%. Three samples with values ranging from 0.05-0.08 ng/mL had CVs
ranging from 13-18%. The results are shown in the table below.

The recovery across the range was evaluated by comparing the observed
versus expected values obtained with the VIDAS TnI Ultra method. Two
studies were performed, one evaluating the range from 0.02 to 32.4 ng/mL
and the other evaluating the range from 0.03 to 0.68 ng/mL. In each case, a
high plasma pool was created by spiking natural troponin antigen into normal
plasma. A very low plasma pool was created by spiking a very low amount of
the same antigen into normal plasma. The two pools were mixed in different
proportions across the range of the assay. The observed results recovered in
the range of 91-110% of the expected TnI values for test samples in the range
of 3.66 to 32.4 ng/mL and 90-124% for test samples in the range of 0.06 to
0.68 ng/mL.
High dose hook effect was evaluated by testing normal human sera spiked
with troponin I at high concentrations up to 1,000 ng/mL. No hook effect was
observed with samples up to this level.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and Value Assignment:
The kit calibrators are traceable to reference calibrators that are prepared
gravimetrically from NIST SRM 2921.
Stability: The shelf life of the product is stated to be 12 months when stored
refrigerated at 2-8°C. Stability studies were performed to support these
claims.
The calibrators and controls are lyophilized. After reconstitution, they are
stable for up to 8 hours at 2-8°C or up to the expiration date of the kit when
stored at -25±6°C. Calibrators and controls may be frozen and thawed up to 4
times.
The stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
Studies were performed following a protocol similar to CLSI EP17-A. A
sample containing no troponin I was tested in duplicate using 2 kit lots over
15 assay runs. In all, 30 measurements (n=30) of the zero standard were
performed. The Limit of Blank (LoB) was defined as the concentration
corresponding to two standard deviations above the mean signal of the zero
standard. The value is then converted to TnI concentration. Based on the
sponsor’s analysis limit of blank (LoB) was determined to be 0.0013 ng/mL.
The sponsor defined Limit of Detection (LoD) as the lowest signal that can be
detected reliably. This value is then converted into TnI concentration. Two
different samples with very low TnI concentration of approximately 0. 006
0.003 ng/mL were tested with 2 kit lots. The limits of detection (LoD) were
5

--- Page 6 ---
determined to be 0.002 ng/mL and 0.008 ng/mL respectively. The sponsor
chose 0.01 ng/mL as the LoD. The device reports results greater or equal to
0.01 ng/mL.
The Limit of Quantitation when defined as where the device achieves a
coefficient of variation (CV) of approximately 10% is 0.11 ng/mL (see
precision section 1. a. above).
e. Analytical specificity:
Evaluation of analytical specificity (cross-reactivity) was done by spiking
each cross-reactant to target concentration into a troponin I negative serum. A
control for each cross-reactant was prepared by spiking the samples with the
same volume of the solvent used for reconstituting the cross-reactant. The
cross-reactant test samples and the control samples were measured on the
VIDAS TNIU and the cross-reactivity was calculated.
Cross-reactant Concentration % Cross-reactivity
Troponin-C (cardiac) 1000 ng/mL <0.001
Troponin-T (cardiac human) 1000 ng/mL 0.2
Troponin-I (skeletal human) 1000 ng/mL <0.001
Troponin-I (skeletal human) 1000 ng/mL <0.001
The effect of potentially interfering endogenous substances (hemoglobin,
bilirubin and triglycerides) was tested by spiking a samples containing
approximately 0.4, 1, 2 and 4 ng/mL TnI with the appropriate concentration of
the test substance and comparing the TnI recovery of the sample to that of a
control sample. Hemoglobin up to 332 uM (2,178 mg/dL), bilirubin up to 510
uM (29 mg/dL), and triglycerides up to 30 g/L did not interfere with the test.
Additionally, the device package insert recommends that samples that appear
hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic not use used and that, if possible, a new sample
be collected.
The effect of potentially interfering common and prescription drugs was tested
at concentrations in excess of 100 times the expected dose level in plasma. A
list of these substances can be found in the package insert.
f. Assay cut-off:
The sponsor determined the cutoff to be 0.11 ng/mL based on the LoQ. (See
precision section 1. 1. above)
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Lithium heparin plasma samples (n=534) were assayed on the VIDAS TNIU
and another commercially available TnI method. Samples ranged in value
6

[Table 1 on page 6]
Cross-reactant	Concentration	% Cross-reactivity
Troponin-C (cardiac)	1000 ng/mL	<0.001
Troponin-T (cardiac human)	1000 ng/mL	0.2
Troponin-I (skeletal human)	1000 ng/mL	<0.001
Troponin-I (skeletal human)	1000 ng/mL	<0.001

--- Page 7 ---
from <0.01 to 19.02 ng/mL on the VIDAS TNIU method. The data were
evaluated using Passing-Bablok regression (slope= 0.42, confidence interval
0.38-0.44) and the Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated (0.97).
For the samples obtained from the US and French study sites, the concordance
between the VIDAS TNIU method and a commercially available method is
shown in the table below:
Times 0-6 hours after 4-12 hours after
admission first collection
US Site Samples (n) 302 300
Concordance % 94.4% 95.3%
French Site Samples (n) 243 153
Concordance 87.2% 94.8%
b. Matrix comparison:
In order to demonstrate equivalence between serum and lithium heparin
plasma TnI results, thirty-seven (37) sample pairs were evaluated. Both
spiked and native samples were included in the study and sample values
ranged in value from 0.04 to 38 ng/mL, which is slightly higher than the
reportable range. Passing and Bablock regression analysis yielded the
following equation with 95% confidence intervals:
Serum (y) = 0.95 [0.91; 0.97] Plasma (x) - 0.01 [-0.09; 0.11]
The labeling recommends that the same collection tube type, serum or lithium
heparinized plasma, should be used when performing serial sampling.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The clinical sensitivity and specificity studies were performed at two clinical
sites, one in the United States (US) at a community hospital and one in France
at a specialized cardiac hospital. For 16 weeks, assays were performed using
samples from patients with chest pain and suspected myocardial infarction.
The samples were collected from the patients within 6 hours following their
admission, and then between 4 and12 hours after the first sample collection.
At the US site a total of 602 samples from patients admitted to the emergency
department (ED) were collected:
(cid:131) Within 0-6 hours after admission, out of the 302 patients concerned, 36
were diagnosed as having myocardial infarction.
