L. Test Principle:
Polystyrene particles coated with specific antibodies to human ß -Microglobulin are
2
aggregated when mixed with samples containing human ß -Microglobulin. These
2
aggregates scatter a beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the
scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in the
sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known
concentration.

EP5-A2, ‘Approved Guideline for Evaluation of Precision Performance of
Clinical Devices’. The intra-assay reproducibility was determined by testing
six samples in duplicate twice a day for 20 days. The samples included the M
and H controls (ß -Microglobulin concentration of 1.88 and 4.86 mg/L
2
respectively), two serum pools (concentrations of 2.13 and 20.35 mg/L) and
two plasma pools (concentrations of 1.76 and 5.69 mg/L). The controls had
%CV ranging from 2.07% to 2.57%, the serum pools 2.13% to 3.01% and the
plasma pools 1.97% to 2.22%.
The inter-assay reproducibility was determined by testing the same six
samples in duplicate twice a day for 20 days. The %CV for the controls
ranged from 3.10% to 3.56 %, the sera pools 3.23% to 4.08% and the plasma
pools 2.94% to 3.28%. The data are summarized below:

Plasma pool 5.69 0.112 1.97 0.186 3.28
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by testing a calibrator with
high concentration (37.42 mg/L) of ß -Microglobulin. This calibrator was
2
serially diluted 6 times with System Diluent down to the lower measuring
range (0.66 mg/L). Each dilution was tested in replicates of three.
The linear regression analysis was performed. The acceptance criteria for the
slope (0.9 and 1.1) and correlation of coefficient ≥0.95 were met. (Slope =
0.973, Intercept = 0.087, Correlation coefficient = 1.00. See figure below).
Linearity was observed between 0.66 to 37.42 mg/L.
Reportable range for the device was set at 0.72 – 23.0 mg/L

High Dose Hook Effect:
The possibility of hook occurring when using the Dimension Vista ® B2MIC
assay was evaluated with serum sample above the assay range. The sample
was analyzed on both the BN ProSpec® System and the Dimension Vista®
System and results indicated no hook effect was observed up to 122 mg/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrator is traceable to the reference material Highly Purified Protein 1st
International Standard (3/17/04 NIBSC).
Device Stability
The expiration date claims for the reagents are as follows:
Unopened reagent cartridges and closed vials:
Dimension Vista® B2MIC Flex® reagent cartridge – 24 months

The analytical sensitivity is defined as the minimal detectable level of analyte,
which can be distinguished from zero. The value was calculated as the mean
value of twenty replicates of System Diluent plus two standard deviations. It
was determined to be 0.176 mg/L.
