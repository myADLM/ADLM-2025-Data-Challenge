(Occult), Creatinine, Glucose, Ketone, Leukocytes, Nitrite, pH, Protein, Protein-to-
Creatinine Ratio, Specific Gravity and Urobilinogen. These measurements are used to
assist diagnosis in the following areas:

I. Device Description:
The Clinitek Advantus Urinalysis analyzer is a semi-automated, bench top analyzer. It is
designed to read Bayer Reagent Strips, such as Multistix 10 SG or Multistix PRO Reagent
Strips.
The analyzer is a reflectance spectrophotometer that analyzes the color and intensity of the
light reflected from the reagent area and reports the results. The analyzer can determine and
report the color of the urine. The user can enter the clarity for each specimen. Calibration is
performed automatically each time a reagent strip is run.
The analyzer has a touch screen display, printer, push bar and fixed platform which consist of
strip loading station, incubation/read station and waste bin.
During testing a reagent strip is manually dipped into a urine sample then placed on the strip
loading station. The push bar moves the strip to the incubation/read station, where it is tested.
When testing is complete, the strip is dropped into the waste bin and the results are printed.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Fresh urine samples from normal adults were prepared by spiking with various
analytes to the desired concentration. The samples were tested using three lots of the
Multistix 10SG and three lots of the Multistix Pro 10LS strips on nine Clinitek
Advantus and nine Clinitek 500 instruments. Six replicates were performed on each
instrument.
