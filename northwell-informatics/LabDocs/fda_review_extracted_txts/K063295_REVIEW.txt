--- Page 2 ---
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For over-the-counter use. In the limitations section of the labeling, there are
statements such as, “There is the possibility that this test may produce false
results”, “You may get a negative result if you have a UTI caused by bacteria that
does not change nitrate to nitrite, when urine has not been held in the bladder for
more than 4 hours, when taking antibiotics, or when your diet does not include
nitrates” and “Consult your physician before making any medical decisions.”
4. Special instrument requirements:
None required; this is a self-contained visually read device.
I. Device Description:
ACON UTI Urinary Tract Infection Test Strips are plastic strips with a nitrite and a
leukocyte reagent pad attached. They are packaged in a plastic bottle that contains
desiccant and a separately packaged color chart. The reagent pads react with urine
and change color. Test results are obtained by comparing the test strip to the color
blocks printed on the color chart. The presence of nitrites in urine will turn the nitrite
test pad pink to red. The presence of leukocytes will turn the leukocyte pad a shade
between beige-pink and dark purple.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Bayer Multistix 10 SG Reagent Strips for Urinalysis
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
k905396
3. Comparison with predicate:
The predicate and the proposed device have the following similarities: assay
format, test methodology, and assay matrix. The assays differ in their intended
use setting (professional use in point-of care setting versus over-the-counter) and
their intended use (the predicate device also detects additional analytes that may
provide information regarding the status of carbohydrate metabolism, kidney and
liver function, acid-base balance in addition to information about urinary tract
infections).
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
Nitrite: Gram negative bacteria in urine convert nitrate to nitrite. In an acidic
medium, nitrite reacts with p-arsanilic acid to form a diazonium compound. The
diazonium compound in turn couples with 1-N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine to
produce a pink color. Nitrite is not detectable in normal urine therefore a consistent
pink to red color evidences nitrite in urine.
2

--- Page 3 ---
Leukocytes: This test reveals the presence of granulocyte esterases in urine. If
esterases are present, they cleave a derivatized pyrazole amino acid ester to liberate
derivatized hydroxy pyrazole. This pyrazole reacts with a diazonium salt to produce a
beige-pink to purple color. Normal urine is usually negative for leukocyte esterases.
Therefore, a color change to +, ++, or +++ may have clinical significance; a color
change to ‘trace’ (±) is considered clinically negative for leukocytes but may have
clinical significance if the user gets repeated trace results.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility of ACON UTI Test Strips was tested by professional users
using a negative control solution and a moderately positive control solution
(positive for nitrites, 2+ for leukocytes). Three lots of strips were used. Each
control was tested in duplicate by five operators per day for ten days (total
strips tested = 600). Results were read by comparing color reaction to the
color blocks on the canister label according to the package insert instructions.
Test results agreed with the expected results each day for each lot tested at
both levels tested.
The ability of lay users to read the test results is demonstrated in Section 3.c.
“Other clinical supportive data” below.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. These tests are intended for qualitative use.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
No traceability was provided.
Stability testing protocol and acceptance criteria were provided. The
sponsor’s accelerated stability testing suggests that the strips will have a 24
month shelf life when stored unopened at room temperature. Real time
stability testing is currently underway.
d. Detection limit:
See Assay Cutoff section below.
e. Analytical specificity:
Potentially interfering endogenous and exogenous substances at the
concentrations in the table below were added to normal urine, urine spiked
with leukocyte positive urine (125 Leu/uL), and nitrite positive urine (1.0
mg/dL). All tests with normal (negative) urine samples returned negative
results except that sodium nitrite produced a positive result for the nitrite test.
All tests with positive urine samples returned positive results except albumin,
ascorbic acid, glucose, sodium bicarbonate and riboflavin. These compounds
were tested further as described below.

A series of experiments were performed to determine if common urine
components, including the compounds that caused positive test results in the
study above, would affect the performance of the ACON UTI test strips. The
components tested with negative urine, samples spiked with nitrite at 0.05,
0.1, and 1.0 mg/dL, and samples spiked with leukocytes at 15, 70, 125, and
500 Leu/uL. The concentrations of the interferents that caused positive test
results above are generally much higher than would be found in urine of
typical users. The labeling includes cautions that ascorbic acid and riboflavin
may interfere with the test. The results of these studies are summarized in the
following table:

The effect of the temperature of the test solution, the length of time the strip
was in contact with the urine sample (‘dip time’) and the test read time after
dipping were also evaluated. Calibrator solutions (negative, low positive and
strongly positive) were used in the tests. Storage of the calibrator solutions at
temperatures ranging from 4°C to 45°C for 30 minutes before using them to
test the strips did not affect the strip’s detection of negative or positive
samples. Dip times of the recommended 2 seconds up to 10 seconds did not
alter the expected result of the test at any read time tested (15 seconds to 30
minutes). Dip times of less than two seconds only affected the test result when
the leukocyte test was read at 15 or 30 seconds (recommended read time is
two minutes). Read times greater than five minutes caused the negative nitrite
and leukocyte tests to read ‘positive’ and the positive leukocytes to read one
color block higher than expected. The labeling instructs users to read the
nitrite test at 1 minute and the leukocyte test at 2 minutes but not to read either
test beyond 3 min.
f. Assay cut-off:
The sensitivity of each test was assessed by testing a range of urine samples
spiked to known concentrations. The sponsor defined the minimum sensitivity
level as the lowest level at which over 67% of the test results show a color
change equivalent to the first color block on the color chart, i.e a uniform pink
for the nitrite test and the beige-pink of the trace block for the leukocyte test.
Three lots of strips were tested. For three consecutive days each sample was
tested 21 times by three operators (7 strips per operator per day). A total of
189 strips were tested at each concentration (3 operators x 3 days x 7 strips x 3
lots). Results were read by comparing color reactions on the strip to the color
chart according to the package instructions. Results are shown in the tables
below:

* “Trace” in the ACON UTI strip is claimed as equivalent to 9 – 15 cells/uL; “trace” in the
Bayer predicate is claimed as equivalent to 5- 15 cells/uL. In clinical interpretation of both
tests a reading of “Trace” is negative for leukocytes. The labeling instructs users to read the
test as positive when the leukocyte result is ≥ + .
The sponsor claims a minimum analytical detection limit of 0.05 mg/dL for
the nitrite test and 9 – 15 cells/uL for the leukocyte test.

* UTI symptoms included at least one of the following: burning or pain during
urination, frequent urination, fever, back or groin pain, or cloudy, dark or bloody
urine, or bad smelling urine. There were no follow up culture results.
Because there were so few nitrite positive samples in the clinical study, the
sponsor recruited 40 lay-users to participate in a readability study with spiked
urine specimens at different concentrations of leukocyte and nitrite:
Spiked Concentrations

Each participant tested a panel of 4 coded and blinded spiked urine samples
with the ACON test using the package insert. The same panel of spiked urine
samples was also tested at the same time by a professional with the ACON
test and the predicate. The test results are summarized in the following tables.
