I. Device Description:
This submission is for AST Panel only. The ID System was not reviewed.
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST
Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and
equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™
Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST broth, which contains an AST
indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST broth is a cation-adjusted formulation
of Mueller-Hinton broth containing 0.01% Tween 80. After adding the indicator solution
to the AST inoculum the color is blue and after inoculation and incubation changes to
pink then to colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds. Inoculated panels are
barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System
instrument where the panels are continuously incubated at 350C. The AST has a final
inoculum of 5 x 105 CFU/ml. The instrument incubates, reads and records the results of
the biochemical substrates and antimicrobial agents and interprets the reactions to give an
ID of the isolate and MIC value and category interpretation of the antimicrobial agents.
Organisms growing in the presence of a given antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator,
signaling organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or
inhibited by a given antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do
not produce a color change. Additional interpretation is done using software driven
“EXPERT” System using rules derived from the CLSI documentation.
Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an AST result available between 4-16 hours.
This is only an autoread result; no manual readings are possible with this system.

L. Test Principle:
The AST portion of the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth
based microdilution method that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-
reduction) to enhance detection of organism growth. The MIC is determined by
comparing growth in wells containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the
growth in “growth control wells” which contains no antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
A clinical trial was conducted with the new cefepime formulation to demonstrate
that accuracy and reproducibility is acceptable. The QC performance was within
the expected ranges as shown under the “Traceability, Stability…. Section.”
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Fifteen gram-negative on-scale organisms were evaluated for site to site and
inter site reproducibility demonstrating >95% reproducibility. The ten isolate
study described in the guidance document was used (10 organisms tested 3
times on 3 days at 3 sites).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality Control was performed on every test occasion with the following
results. BD Phoenix™ produced acceptable QC results as compared to the
reference method results >95% of the time.

interpretation (SIR) agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation.
Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the BD Phoenix™ and the
reference and have on-scale EA.
The 2 vmj errors tested positive for ESBL both in BD Phoenix™ and the reference

“Resistant” making it in agreement with the reference method.
