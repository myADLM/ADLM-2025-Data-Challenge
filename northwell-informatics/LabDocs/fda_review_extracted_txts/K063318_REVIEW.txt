plasma (EDTA, Heparin, Citrate, ACD). This kit can be used as an aid in the
diagnosis of acute or past Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) infection or as an aid in the
identification of HAV-susceptible individuals for vaccination. However, any
diagnosis should take into consideration the patient’s clinical history and
symptoms, as well as serological data.
Assay performance characteristics have not been established for
immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patients, and core blood or neonatal
specimens.
WARNING: This assay is not intended for screening blood or solid or soft tissue
donors.

L. Test Principle:
The MONOLISA™ Anti-HAV EIA is an enzyme immunoassay (competitive assay
format) for the detection of total antibodies to Hepatitis A virus. In the assay
procedure, patient specimens, a calibrator and controls are incubated with HAV
antigen in microwells that have been coated with mouse monoclonal anti-Hepatitis A
antibodies. Antibodies to HAV present in a specimen or control will complex with
the HAV antigen reagent and with antibodies coated on the microwells. Excess
sample and HAV Viral antigen reagent are removed by a wash step. The conjugate
(containing horseradish peroxidase-labeled mouse monoclonal antibody to HAV) is
subsequently added to the microwells and incubated. The conjugate binds to the
HAV antigen bound to the microwell in the absence of antibodies to HAV from the
specimen. Excess conjugate is removed by a wash step, and a TMB Chromogen /
Substrate solution is added to the microwells and allowed to incubate. If a sample
does not contain anti-HAV antibodies, the bound enzyme (HRP) causes the colorless

color turns yellow after the addition of a Stopping Solution. If a sample contains anti-
HAV antibodies, the Chromogen / Substrate Solution in the well remains colorless
during the substrate incubation, and after the addition of the Stopping Solution. The
color intensity is measured spectrophotometrically.
Absorbance value readings for patient specimens are compared to the Cutoff value
determined by the mean of the Calibrator absorbance values.

Reproducibility Study:
A 6 member panel consisting of diluted plasma specimens (negative and
different levels of positive) was tested in triplicate, once a day for 3 days on 3
lots* of MONOLISATM Anti-HAV EIA at 3 separate clinical trial sites. Each
panel was coded with a different number on each day tested in order to blind
the operator to the expected value of the sample.
*:3 different lots were used at the Bio-Rad site and 2 lots were used on each
of the external sites.
The data from all reagent lots and sites were combined to obtain Standard
Deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of variation (CV) for within run,
between day, between lot, between site and total variance. The data were
analyzed according to the principles described in the Clinical Laboratory
Standards Institute guidance EP5-A2, revised November 2004 and ISO/TR
22971:2005. The PROC GLM procedure in SAS® was used to estimate the
variance components of the model. The model was y = site + lot (site) + day
(lot site) + error.

f. Assay cut-off:
The assay calibrator is equivalent to 20 mIU/mL standardized to the WHO
2nd Reference Standard for Anti-Hepatitis Immunoglobulin. However,
assay results cannot be considered quantitative and no clinical claims for
immunity can be determined from the cutoff.

Clinical Studies
A multi-center prospective and retrospective study was conducted to
evaluate the clinical performance of the MONOLISATM Anti-HAV EIA
assay among individuals with signs or symptoms and those at high risk of
Hepatitis infection. Specimens were collected in 3 different geographical
areas: 404 specimens were collected in the US and 928 were collected in
Europe (France and Italy).
The US population consisted of 174 subjects with signs and symptoms of
Hepatitis.
Of these, 60% were male and 40% were female, and they ranged in age
from 17 to 72 years (mean age of 38). The group was Caucasian (13.2%),
Black or African American (4.6%), Hispanic or Latino (2.9%), and Asian
(41.9%), with 1.1% represented by multiple ethnic groups. The remaining
36.8% were unknown. Among these 174 subjects, 23 (13.2%) were
pediatric samples.
The 230 subjects from the high-risk group for Hepatitis A include
intravenous drug users (N= 55), homosexual males (N=15), sex workers
(N=39), prison history (N= 92), high-risk sex partners (N=25), and high-
risk occupation/health care workers (N=4). Many had more than 1 high-
risk behavior or risk factor. The group was Caucasian (7.4%), Black or
African American (74.3%), Hispanic or Latino (15.2%), Asian (0.4%),
Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander (0.4%), and American Indian or
Alaska native (0.9%), with the remaining (1.3%) represented by multiple
ethnic groups. Of these, 81% were male and 19% were female, and they
ranged in age from 18 to 70 years (mean age of 45). Among these 230
subjects, 2 (0.9%) were pediatric samples.
The European population consisted of 252 specimens collected from
patients with signs and symptoms of Hepatitis. Of these, 51% were male
and 49% were female, and they ranged in age from 1 to 105 years (mean
age of 53). Sixty-two (62) specimens were collected from a population at
high risk for hepatitis composed of intravenous drug users (30), subjects
who had clotting factor disorders (7) and MSM patients (25). The group
was 87% male and 13% female, and ranged in age from 21 to 75 years
(mean age of 40).
Three hundred and forty five (345) specimens were from an asymptomatic
hospitalized population. Of these, 51% were male and 49% were female,
and they ranged in age from 18 to 87 years (mean age of 59). Thirty four
specimens were from healthcare workers (for HAV pre-vaccination
screening). One hundred and fifty one (151) patients had recovered HAV

infection. Among these 844 european samples, 35 (4.1%) were from
pediatric subjects.
Vaccinated subjects:
Sixty-two (62) pre- and post-vaccination samples from 38 individuals
were tested. Fourteen (14) individuals were enrolled in a vaccination
program. They received the TWINRIX® vaccine, a combined Hepatitis A
and Hepatitis B vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline. A pre-vaccination
sample was collected the day of the first vaccination dose. A second
sample was collected before the second vaccination dose was injected (one
month after the first dose). A third dose of vaccine was scheduled 6
months after the first injection. The sample after the third vaccination
dose was not available.
Twenty samples were collected from 10 subjects, aged 24 to 45 years, who
had received the HAVRIX® vaccine. These subjects received HAVRIX®
1440, an inactivated Hepatitis A vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline, in a two-
dose schedule (at 0 and 6 to 12 months). For each subject, a pre-and a
post-vaccination specimen was obtained. All post-vaccination samples
were obtained 4 weeks after vaccination. Fourteen purchased post-
vaccination samples were tested; 8 were from individuals vaccinated with
HAVRIX® and 6 were from individuals vaccinated with VAQTA® from
Merck &Co.

4. Clinical cut-off:
See assay cut-off previously described in this document
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected results of the MONOLISATM Anti-HAV EIA assay were
determined in presumably healthy individuals from the Mid-west US (St Louis,
Missouri), the Western US (California and Washington) and from Europe (Parma,
Italy). In the Mid-west, the population was 55% female and 45% male, with ages
ranging from 1 to 96 years. 48% (134) were pediatric specimens.
The majority of the subjects were White/Caucasian (64%), and 32% were black or
African American; for 4% data were not available. In this study, 41 % were found
reactive for Anti-HAV total antibodies, and 57% were found nonreactive.
In the Western US, 73% were from California, 27% were from Washington. The
population was 56% female and 44% male, and their ages ranged from 15 to 90
years.
In this population, 38% were found reactive for Anti-HAV total antibodies, and
62% were found nonreactive. In Europe, the population was 50% female and
50% male, with ages ranging from 18 to 87 years. In this group, 69% were found
reactive for Anti-HAV total antibodies and 31% were found nonreactive. The
expected results for the US and for presumably healthy individuals living in
Europe are presented below (Tables 5, 6 and 7).

Adult Subjects At High Risk For Viral Hepatitis:
Expected results of asymptomatic prospective high-risk subjects, determined from
a multi-center study in the US and in Europe, are reported in the following tables.
A total of 230 US subjects were at high risk for viral hepatitis including
intravenous drug users (N= 55), homosexual males (N=15), sex workers (N=39),
prison history (N= 92), high-risk sex partners (N=25), and high-risk
occupation/health care workers (N=4). Many had more than 1 high-risk behavior
or risk factor. Subjects were from Los Angeles, CA, (86.5%), Santa Ana, CA
(4.3%), or Miami, FL (9.1%). The group was Caucasian (7.4%), Black or African
American (74.3%), Hispanic or Latino (15.2%), Asian (0.4%), Native Hawaiian
or other Pacific Islander (0.4%), and American Indian or Alaska native (0.9%),
with the remaining (1.3%) represented by multiple ethnic groups. Of these
subjects, 81% were male and 19% were female, and they ranged in age from 18 to
70 years (mean age of 45). The data are reported in Table below. The percent of
Anti-HAV reactive results with MONOLISATM Anti-HAV EIA in this high-risk
asymptomatic population was 53%.
The European group (N= 62) was 87% male and 13% female, and ranged in age
from 21 to 75 years (mean age of 40). It consisted of intravenous drug users (30),
subjects who had clotting factor disorders (7) and MSM patients (25). The data
are reported in Table 9.
The percent of Anti-HAV reactive results with MONOLISATM Anti-HAV EIA in
this high-risk asymptomatic population was 45%.

N. Proposed labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirement of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS:
For in vitro diagnostic use only
1. The MONOLISATM Anti-HAV EIA contains human source material used in the
preparation of Negative Control (C0), Positive Control (C1) and Calibrator (C2)
that has been tested with either FDA or CE approved methods and found non-
reactive for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibodies to Hepatitis C Virus
(HCV) and antibodies to Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIV-1 and HIV-2).
2. The HAV Viral Antigen reagent (R6) has been treated with formalin to inactivate
the virus.
3. No known test method can offer complete assurance that infectious agents are
absent. Therefore, all human blood derivatives, reagents and human specimens
should be handled as if capable of transmitting infectious disease. It is
recommended that reagents and human specimens be handled in accordance with
the OSHA Standard on Bloodborne Pathogens. Biosafety Level 2 or other
appropriate biosafety practices should be used for materials that contain or are
suspected of containing infectious agents.
4. The following is a list of potential chemical hazards contained in some kit
components (See section 4: REAGENTS):
4.1 ProClin™ 300 (0.1% and 0.25%) are biocidal preservatives that may cause
sensitization by skin contact; prolonged or repeated exposure may cause
allergic reaction in certain sensitive individuals.
4.2 The 1N Sulfuric Acid (H SO ) Stopping Solution is irritating to skin and
2 4
severely irritating or corrosive to eyes, depending on the amount and length of
exposure; greater exposures can cause eye damage, including permanent
impairment of vision. In case of contact with eyes, rinse immediately with
plenty of water and seek medical advice. Keep away from strong bases,
reducing agents and metals; do not pour water into this component. Waste
from this material is considered hazardous acidic waste. However, if
permitted by local, regional, and national regulations, it can be neutralized to
pH 6-9 for non-hazardous disposal if operators are trained and equipped to do
so.
4.3 Sodium azide (< 0.1%), a biocidal preservative, may be detrimental if enough
is ingested. Sodium azide may react with certain metals, including lead or
copper often found in plumbing, to form highly explosive metal azides. Flush
with copious amounts of water when pouring dilute solutions down the drain
to prevent explosive build-up.
5. Biological spills: Human source material spills should be treated as potentially
infectious. Spills not containing acid should be immediately decontaminated,
including the spill area, materials, and any contaminated surfaces or equipment,
with an appropriate chemical disinfectant that is effective for the potential

--- Page 18 ---
Page 18 of 18
biohazards relative to the samples involved (commonly a 1:10 dilution of bleach,
70-80% Ethanol or Isopropanol, an iodophor [such as 0.5% Wescodyne™ Plus],
or a phenolic, etc.) and wiped dry.18-20
6. Spills containing acid should be appropriately absorbed or neutralized, and wiped
dry. The area should be decontaminated with an appropriate agent. Materials
used to absorb the spill should be disposed of as biohazardous waste.
NOTE: DO NOT PLACE SOLUTIONS CONTAINING BLEACH INTO THE
AUTOCLAVE.
7. Dispose of all specimens and material used to perform the test as though they
contain an infectious agent. Laboratory chemical or biohazardous wastes must be
handled and discarded in accordance with all local, regional and national
regulations.
Conclusion:
The submitted material in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
