Class II Special Control Guidance Document, Hepatitis A Virus Serological Assays,
issued February 9, 2006.
L. Test Principle:
The MONOLISA™ Anti-HAV IgM EIA is an enzyme immunoassay (IgM antibody
capture format) for the detection of IgM antibodies to Hepatitis A Virus. In the assay
procedure, patient specimens, a calibrator, and controls are incubated with anti-
human IgM antibodies coated on the microwells. If IgM antibodies to HAV are
present in a specimen or control, they bind to the antibody. Excess sample is removed
by a wash step. The HAV Viral Antigen and the Conjugate (containing horseradish
peroxidase – labeled mouse monoclonal antibody to HAV) are successively added to
the microwells and allowed to incubate. The presence of IgM anti-HAV in the
sample enables the HAV Viral Antigen and the Conjugate to bind to the solid phase.
Excess Conjugate and HAV Viral Antigen are removed by a wash step, and a TMB
Chromogen / Substrate solution is added to the microwells and allowed to incubate.
If a sample contains anti-HAV IgM, the bound enzyme (HRP) causes the colorless
TMB in the Chromogen solution to change to blue. The blue color turns yellow after
the addition of a Stopping Solution. If a sample does not contain anti-HAV IgM, the
Chromogen / Substrate solution in the well remains colorless during the substrate
incubation, and after the addition of the Stopping Solution. The color intensity is
measured spectrophotometrically. Absorbance value readings for patient specimens
are compared to the cutoff value.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-Laboratory Precision Study:
A 21-member panel was tested: serum samples with the 6 corresponding
plasma samples (EDTA K2, EDTA K3, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Heparin,
Lithium heparin, ACD) at 3 different levels (1 negative, 1 negative near the
cutoff, 1 low positive near the cutoff) were tested on 1 lot, in duplicate, in 2
different runs per day (am and pm), by the same operator for a period of 20
days. The data were analyzed following the CLSI guidance EP5A2. The
mean ratio, the Standard Deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of variation
(%CV) were calculated for each panel member.

Reproducibility Study:
A 6 member panel consisting of diluted plasma specimens (negative and
different levels of positive) was tested in triplicate, once a day for 3 days on 3
lots* of MONOLISATM Anti-HAV IgM EIA at 3 separate clinical trial sites.
Each panel was coded with a different number on each day tested in order to
blind the operator to the expected value of the sample. *3 different lots were
used at the Bio-Rad site and 2 lots were used on each of the external sites.
The data from all reagent lots and sites were combined to obtain standard
deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of variation (CV) for within run,
between day, between lot, between site and total variance. The data were
analyzed according to the principles described in the Clinical Laboratory
Standards Institute guidance EP5-A2, revised November 2004 and ISO/TR
22971:2005. The PROC GLM procedure in SAS® was used to estimate the
variance components of the model. The model was y = site + lot (site) + day
(lot site) + error.

Clinical Performance
A multi-center prospective and retrospective study was conducted to evaluate
the clinical performance of the MONOLISATM Anti-HAV IgM EIA assay
among individuals with signs or symptoms and those at high risk for Hepatitis
infection. Specimens were collected in 3 different geographical areas: 404
specimens were collected in the US and 929 were collected in Europe (France
and Italy).
The US population consisted of 174 subjects with signs and symptoms of
Hepatitis. In this group, 60% were male and 40% were female, and they
ranged in age from 17 to 72 years (mean age of 38). The group was
Caucasian (13.2%), Black or African American (4.6%), Hispanic or Latino
(2.9%), and Asian (41.9%), with the remaining 1.1% represented by multiple
ethnic groups. The ethnicity of 36.8% was unknown. Among these subjects,
23 (13.2%) were pediatric samples.
The 230 subjects from the high-risk group for Hepatitis A include intravenous
drug users (N= 55), homosexual males (N=15), sex workers (N=39), prison
history (N= 92), high-risk sex partners (N=25), high-risk occupation/health
care workers (N=4). Many had more than 1 high-risk behavior or risk factor.
The group was Caucasian (7.4%), Black or African American (74.3%),
Hispanic or Latino (15.2%), Asian (0.4%), Native Hawaiian or other Pacific
Islander (0.4%), and American Indian or Alaska native (0.9%), with the
remaining 1.3% represented by multiple ethnic groups. In this group, 81%
were male and 19% were female, and they ranged in age from 18 to 70 years
(mean age of 45). Among these 230 subjects, 2 (0.9%) were pediatric samples.
The European population consisted of 253 specimens collected from patients
with signs and symptoms of Hepatitis. In this group, 51% were male and 49%
were female and they ranged in age from 1 to 105 years (mean age of 53).

--- Page 10 ---
Page 10 of 20
Sixty-two (62) specimens were collected from a population at high risk for
hepatitis composed of intravenous drug users (30), subjects who had clotting
factor disorders (7) and MSM patients (25). The group was 87% male and
13% female and ranged in age from 21 to 75 years (mean age of 40).
There were 345 specimens from an asymptomatic hospitalized population and
34 were from healthcare workers (for HAV pre-vaccination screening).
One hundred and fifty one (151) patients had recovered HAV infection.
Among these 845 European samples, 36 (4.3%) were from pediatric subjects.
Percent Agreement:
The results obtained with MONOLISATM Anti-HAV IgM EIA were compared
with the results obtained using the comparative assay. The positive and
negative percent agreements and the 95% exact confidence between
MONOLISATM Anti-HAV IgM EIA and the comparative assay were
calculated. To determine the percent agreement on borderline results the
following criteria were used:
(cid:131) Specimens that were borderline with the comparative assay and reactive
with MONOLISATM Anti-HAV IgM EIA were considered as false
positives for MONOLISATM Anti-HAV IgM EIA assay
(cid:131) Specimens that were borderline with the comparative assay and non
reactive with MONOLISATM Anti-HAV IgM EIA were considered as
false negatives for MONOLISATM Anti-HAV IgM EIA
The results obtained with the US specimens and with the European specimens
are presented in the following tables:

For all seroconversion panels, both MONOLISATM Anti-HAV IgM EIA and
the comparative assay detected HAV IgM antibodies at the same first bleed.
MONOLISATM Anti-HAV IgM EIA appears to detect IgM for a longer
period than the comparator assay for qualitative determination of IgM
antibody to Hepatitis A.
Among seroconversion panels beginning with samples negative for anti-HAV
antibodies and having subsequent samples to 5-6 months, one (PHT-902)
becomes borderline after 5 months and one (PHT-901) gives a negative result
after more than 20 months. Another seroconversion panel (RP-013) with
samples collected through 6 months has a declining ratio but still remains
positive. The other panels contain members collected through 2 to 3 months.

Healthy individuals:
The expected results of the MONOLISATM Anti-HAV IgM EIA assay were
determined in presumably healthy individuals from the Mid-west US (St Louis),
the Western US (California and Washington) and from Europe (Parma, Italy).
In the Mid-west, the population was 55% female and 45% male, with ages that
ranged from 1 to 96 years. 48% (134) were pediatric specimens. The majority of
the subjects were White/Caucasian (64%) and 32% were black or African
American; for 4% data were not available. In the Western US, 73% were from
California and 27% were from Washington. The population was 56% female and
44% male, with ages that ranged from 15 to 90 years. In Europe, the population
was 50% female and 50% male, with ages that ranged from 18 to 87 years.
The expected results for the US and for Europe are presented below. The percent
of Anti-HAV IgM reactive results with MONOLISATM Anti-HAV IgM EIA were
0.4% for the US and 0.7% for Europe.

Adult subjects at high risk for viral hepatitis:
Expected results of asymptomatic prospective high-risk subjects determined from
a multi-center study in the US and in Europe are reported in the following tables.
A total of 230 US Subjects were at high risk for viral hepatitis including
intravenous drug users (N= 55), homosexual males (N=15), sex workers (N=39),
prison history (N= 92), high-risk sex partners (N=25), high-risk occupation/health
care workers (N=4). Many had more than 1 high-risk behavior or risk factor.
Subjects were from Los Angeles, CA, (86.5%), Santa Ana, CA (4.3%), or Miami,
FL (9.1%). The group was Caucasian (7.4%), Black or African American
(74.3%), Hispanic or Latino (15.2%), Asian (0.4%), Native Hawaiian or other
Pacific Islander (0.4%), and American Indian or Alaska native (0.9%), with the
remaining 1.3% represented by multiple ethnic groups.
The subjects were 81% male and 19% female, and ranged in age from 18 to 70
years (mean age of 45). The data are reported in Table 4.
The percent of Anti-HAV IgM reactive results with MONOLISATM Anti-HAV
IgM EIA in this high-risk asymptomatic population was 0%.
The European group (N= 62) was 87% male and 13% female and ranged in age
from 21 to 75 years (mean age of 40). It consisted of intravenous drug users (30),
subjects who had clotting factor disorders (7) and MSM patients (25). The data
are reported in Table 5.
The percent of Anti-HAV IgM reactive results with MONOLISATM Anti-HAV
IgM EIA in this high-risk asymptomatic population was 0%.

the preparation of Negative Control (C0), Positive Control (C1) and Calibrator
(C2) that has been tested with either FDA or CE approved methods and found
non-reactive for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibodies to Hepatitis C
Virus (HCV) and antibodies to Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIV-1 and
HIV-2).
2. The HAV Viral Antigen reagent (R6) has been treated with formalin to inactivate
the virus.
3. No known test method can offer complete assurance that infectious agents are
absent. Therefore, all human blood derivatives, reagents and human specimens
should be handled as if capable of transmitting infectious disease. It is
recommended that reagents and human specimens be handled in accordance with
the OSHA Standard on Bloodborne Pathogens. Biosafety Level 2 or other
appropriate biosafety practices should be used for materials that contain or are
suspected of containing infectious agents.
4. The following is a list of potential chemical hazards contained in some kit
components (See section 4: REAGENTS):
4.1 ProClin™ 300 (0.1% and 0.25%) are biocidal preservatives that may cause
sensitization by skin contact; prolonged or repeated exposure may cause
allergic reaction in certain sensitive individuals.
4.2 The 1N Sulfuric Acid (H SO ) Stopping Solution is irritating to skin and
2 4
severely irritating or corrosive to eyes, depending on the amount and length of
exposure; greater exposures can cause eye damage, including permanent
impairment of vision. In case of contact with eyes, rinse immediately with
plenty of water and seek medical advice. Keep away from strong bases,
reducing agents and metals; do not pour water into this component. Waste
from this material is considered hazardous acidic waste. However, if
permitted by local, regional, and national regulations, it can be neutralized to
pH 6-9 for non-hazardous disposal if operators are trained and equipped to do
so.
4.3 Sodium azide (< 0.1%), a biocidal preservative, may be detrimental if enough
is ingested. Sodium azide may react with certain metals, including lead or
copper often found in plumbing, to form highly explosive metal azides. Flush
with copious amounts of water when pouring dilute solutions down the drain
to prevent explosive build-up.
5. Biological spills: Human source material spills should be treated as potentially
infectious. Spills not containing acid should be immediately decontaminated,
including the spill area, materials, and any contaminated surfaces or equipment,
with an appropriate chemical disinfectant that is effective for the potential
biohazards relative to the samples involved (commonly a 1:10 dilution of bleach,
70-80% Ethanol or Isopropanol, an iodophor [such as 0.5% Wescodyne™ Plus],
or a phenolic, etc.) and wiped dry.
6. Spills containing acid should be appropriately absorbed or neutralized, and wiped
dry. The area should be decontaminated with an appropriate agent. Materials
used to absorb the spill should be disposed of as biohazardous waste.

--- Page 20 ---
Page 20 of 20
NOTE: DO NOT PLACE SOLUTIONS CONTAINING BLEACH INTO THE
AUTOCLAVE.
7. Dispose of all specimens and material used to perform the test as though they
contain an infectious agent. Laboratory chemical or biohazardous wastes must be
handled and discarded in accordance with all local, regional and national
regulations.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted material in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
