Guideline: EP5-A2, CLSI Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient
Samples; Approved Guideline EP9-A2, CLSI Interference Testing in Clinical
Chemistry; Approved Guideline EP7-A2.
L. Test Principle:
Proteins contained in human body fluids form immune complexes in an
immunochemical reaction with specific antibodies. These complexes scatter a
beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is
proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The
result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility: Precision testing was done in accordance with
CLSI Approved Guideline EP5-A2. Two samples derived from serum pools
and two samples derived from plasma pools representing TRF
concentrations that span the measuring range, and the PROT1 CON L, M
and H were analyzed in duplicate, for 20 days, two runs per day. The
repeatability and within-lab standard deviations (SD) and percent coefficient

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the range was confirmed by testing a calibrator with a high
concentration of transferrin. The calibrator was serially diluted in 5,
approximately two fold increments (measuring range from 0.28 to 6.95 g/L).
Each dilution was tested in replicates of three. Data were analyzed using
linear regression analysis: regression analysis of theoretical concentration
versus measured concentration produced the following results:
Slope Y-Intercept Correlation n
g/L Coefficient
1.038 -0.045 0.999 15
Recovery testing with European reference material ERM ®-DA470* was
performed with 5 replicates of a TRF sample 2.45 g/L. Results ranged from
97.1 -100.2% with a mean recovery of 98.8%.
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
Calibration material values were referenced to the European reference
material ERM ®-DA470*.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical sensitivity was determined by assaying analyte-free System
Diluent 20 times and determining the mean value plus two SDs: 0.062 g/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Interference Studies Interference testing was performed according to
CLSI EP7-A2, to determine the effect of various endogenous and
exogenous substances on the Dimension Vista™ TRF assay. For the
following interferents, the percent bias was determined by testing a
control samples without the interferent and comparing it to the value
obtained from a test sample to which the potential interferent was
added: bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated, 60 mg/dL),
hemoglobin (1000 mg/dL), creatinine (30 mg/dL), albumin (6 g/dL),
urea (500 mg/dL), cholesterol (500 mg/dL), uric acid (20 mg/dL).
Minimal interference (<8%) was observed. Interference by

triglycerides (native and clarified) was tested on 5 test samples
containing a known amount of triglycerides and comparing results
from the same sample after centrifugation. Interference was less than
6%. Samples containing rheumatoid factor (>500 IU/ml) or total
protein >120 g/L were mixed 1:1 with TRF concentrations and %
recovery was compared to samples without RF using 5 replicates. No
interference was observed up to 350 IU/ml and 88 g/L TP.
Additionally, 41 potentially interfering drugs were also assayed and
shown to exhibit minimal interference (<10%).
ii. Cross-reactivity with autoimmune antibodies common to other
systemic autoimmune diseases was not tested.
iii. Antigen Excess: The effect of antigen excess was evaluated using a
serum sample with a high concentration of transferrin (above the assay
range). No effect was seen up to 9.46 g/L. Samples whose values
exceed 5.6 g/L using the initial 1:20 dilution are reported as “exceeds
assay range” to alert the user to repeat the assay using a higher
dilution.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The Dimension Vista™ TR assay was compared to the Dade Behring N
Antisera to Human Transferrin assay on the BN ProSepc ® System by
evaluating serum and plasma samples with concentrations ranging from 0.79
to 5.43 g/L. Regression analysis of these results yielded the following
statistics:
Comparative Slope Y-Intercept (g/L) Correlation n
Method (95%CI) (95%CI) Coefficient
N Antisera to Human

Transferrin on the 0.992 180

BN ProSpec ®
b. Matrix comparison:
Ten matched samples of serum, EDTA, lithium heparin and sodium heparin
plasma containing concentrations of transferrin spanning the measuring
range (0.37 to 4.92 g/L), were assayed and compared. Regression analysis
showed no significant bias between the four matrices and yielded the
following information:

Lithium heparin plasma Mean = -0.5% 0.98
