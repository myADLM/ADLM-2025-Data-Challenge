L. Test Principle:
Patient plasma samples are diluted and incubated with tPA solution to allow for the tPA
and PAI-1 in the sample to react. Acetate buffer is added to the sample to destroy α-2-
antiplasmin which would interfere with the assay. Next, the samples are incubated with a
chromogenic substrate for plasmin (PAR), so that residual tPA activity in the sample
catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn hydrolyzes the
chromogenic substrate. The amount of color developed in inversely proportional l to the
amount of PAI-1 activity in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra and inter-assay variability with 3 control samples. In Study 1, three PAI-1
controls were assayed 4 times per run for 20 total runs. In study 2, 3 PAI-1 levels
were assayed 4 times per run for 5 total runs. Two lots were tested.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Five samples of known PAI concentrations were prepared from
samples of known PAI concentrations. Low (0 U/ml), mid low (10,
U/ml), mid high (30 U/ml), and high (40 U/ml) samples were run
using the Spectrolyse® PAI-1 assay in replicates of four. A least
squares regression line was fit to the PAI-1 U/mL (Y) vs theoretical
concentrations of PAI-1 samples (X) data. y = 0.998x + 1.1, r=
0.998.
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
The PAI 0 standard is calibrated against a Primary Standard
according to SOP CHRO21_A, Determining the Activity of tPA
Standard.
d. Detection limit:
The 0 Standard and a patient sample known to have a result between
0 and 10 PAI, was assayed 20 times. Results U/mL. were analyzed
according to the recommendations in NCCLS guideline EP17-A, and
the LoB was calculated to be 2.6 U/mL, and the LoD was calculated
to be 4.6
e. Analytical specificity:

Seven patient samples (untreated with antibody) were assayed in
duplicated using ADI Spectrolyse® PAI-1 assay. Each patient
sample was mixed with an anti-PAI antibody or with an anti-FVIII
antibody negative control antibody. Results demonstrated that PAI-1
levels were essentially the same in untreated samples and samples
treated with control antibody. Samples treated with anti-PAI-1
antibody had significantly reduced PAI-1 levels.
