4. Special instrument requirements:
The ARCHITECT i System (K962919/S1)
I. Device Description:
The ARCHITECT HAVAB-M assay is a two-step immunoassay for the qualitative
detection of IgM anti-HAV in human serum and plasma using CMIA technology with
flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex. In the first step, prediluted sample,
assay diluent, and hepatitis A virus (human) coated paramagnetic microparticles are
combined. IgM anti-HAV present in the sample binds to the hepatitis A virus
(human) coated microparticles. After washing, the IgM anti-HAV binds to the anti-
human IgM acridinium-labeled conjugate that is added in the second step. Following
another wash cycle, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction
mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units
(RLUs). A direct relationship exists between the amount of IgM anti-HAV in the
sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT i System optics. The presence or
absence of IgM anti-HAV in the specimen is determined by comparing the
chemiluminescent signal in the reaction to the cutoff signal determined from an active
ARCHITECT HAVAB-M calibration. The ARCHITECT HAVAB-M assay is
calibrated with ARCHITECT HAVAB-M Standard Calibrator. ARCHITECT
HAVAB-M Controls are assayed for the verification of the accuracy and precision of

L. Test Principle:
The ARCHITECT HAVAB-M assay is a two-step immunoassay for the qualitative
detection of IgM anti-HAV in human serum and plasma using CMIA technology.
First step: Sample (pre-diluted), assay diluent, and paramagnetic microparticles
coated with HAV (human) are combined. IgM anti-HAV present in the sample binds
to the HAV (human) coated microparticles.
Second step: After washing, the IgM anti-HAV binds to the anti-human IgM
acridinium-labeled conjugate. Following another wash cycle, pre-trigger and trigger
solutions are added, and the resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as
relative light units (RLUs) detected by the ARCHITECT i System optics.
The presence or absence of IgM anti-HAV in the specimen is determined by
comparing the chemiluminescent signal in the reaction to the cutoff signal determined
from an active ARCHITECT HAVAB-M calibration.

The ARCHITECT i System calculates the cutoff RLU from the Calibrator mean
•
RLU. The cutoff RLU is stored for each reagent lot calibration.
Cutoff RLU = 0.375 x (Calibrator mean RLU)
The ARCHITECT i System calculates the S/CO result for each sample as follows:
•
S/CO = Sample RLU/Cutoff RLU
Interpretation of Results:
Result Instrument Interpretation
(S/CO) Interpretation
< 0.80 Nonreactive IgM anti-HAV not detected. Does not
(NR) exclude the possibility of exposure to or
infection with HAV. Levels of anti-HAV
IgM may be below the cut-off in early
infection.
0.80 Grayzone IgM antibodies to HAV may or may not
to (GZ) be present. Patients exhibiting grayzone
< 1.21 test results should be closely monitored
by redrawing and retesting at
approximately one week intervals.*
Reactive IgM anti-HAV detected. Presumptive
≥ 1.21 (R) evidence of HAV infection. A reactive
anti-HAV IgM result does not rule out
other hepatitis infections.
* Monitoring the level of IgM anti-HAV by redrawing and retesting at approximately one week
intervals will distinguish rapidly rising IgM anti-HAV levels associated with early acute hepatitis
A infection from gradually decreasing or unchanging IgM anti-HAV levels often associated with
late acute stage of HAV infection.
Assay results should be interpreted only in the context of other clinical laboratory
findings and the total clinical status of the individual. It has been shown that a viremic
window exists with individuals infected with HAV where the individual may be
symptomatic for hepatitis but IgM anti-HAV nonreactive.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
In addition to the required preclinical studies, the testing scheme was incorporated
into the Precision, Calibration Curve Storage, and Instrument Percent Agreement
studies. The results from these studies confirm that the ARCHITECT HAVAB-M
assay can be used on the ARCHITECT i 2000 and i 2000SR.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-laboratory precision:
A 20-day precision study was performed at Abbott Laboratories based on
guidance from the CLSI document EP5-A2. ARCHITECT i 2000 and i
2000 were used. Testing was performed using 2 instruments (one of each),
SR
3 assay reagent lots, 3 calibrator lots, and one control lot. The ARCHITECT

f. Assay cut-off:
The presence or absence of IgM antibody to Hepatitis A virus in the sample is
determined by comparing the chemiluminescent signal in the reaction to the
cutoff RLU determined from an active ARCHITECT HAVAB-M calibration.
The ARCHITECT HAVAB-M results are expressed as the ratio of the sample
RLU to the cutoff RLU (S/CO):
S/CO = Sample RLU / Cutoff RLU
where the Cutoff RLU = Calibrator 1 mean RLU x 0.375
where the cutoff multipler value has been established using a population of
specimens, and ROC analysis demonstrated that the optimal sensitivity and
specificity is achieved when the cutoff is set using a multiplier of 0.375.
168/173 of true positive specimens were detected, for a sensitivity of 97.11%
and specificity of 100.00% (2119/2119) at the lower limit (-20%) of GZ
(S/CO = 0.80). The seroconversion sensitivity was verified with this cutoff
and found to be acceptable when compared to predicate FDA approved assay,
and clinical investigation data support the cutoff calculation.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Of the 658 specimens from the intended use population tested in a prospective
multi-center study, 554 specimens (Population 1) were obtained from
individuals living in the United States from the following populations: 253
specimens were from individuals at increased risk of HAV infection; 200
specimens were from individuals with signs and symptoms of hepatitis; 1
specimen was from an individual diagnosed with acute HAV infection; and
100 specimens were from pediatric individuals. Additionaly, 104 specimens
(Population 2) were obtained from individuals living outside the United States
diagnosed with acute HAV infection (including one pre-selected IgM anti-
HAV positive specimen).
The comparison of the ARCHITECT HAVAB-M results to the comparator
IgM anti-HAV results and associated percent agreement (including 95% exact
confidence intervals) are summarized in the following tables. Data are listed

Performance Cord Blood:
A study was conducted to evaluate whether neonate samples may be tested
with the ARCHITECT HAVAB-M assay. Cord blood was used as a surrogate
for neonate serum. Twenty-six matched cord blood and maternal serum
samples were spiked with IgM HAV positive stock to yield a high negative
sample (target S/CO 0.80) and a low positive sample (target S/CO 1.20). None
of the samples were initially reactive. The data obtained upon spiking are
summarized in the following table, showing the amount of bias for the cord
blood samples from the matched maternal serum samples. All individual
samples listed as having >10% bias observed with the cord blood exhibited
negative bias when compared to matched maternal serum sample.

HAV Prevalence Population
Of the 1167 specimens tested in the ARCHITECT HAVAB-M clinical study, 862
specimens were from the following populations: 509 specimens were from
apparently healthy individuals, 253 specimens were from individuals at increased
risk of HAV infection, and 100 specimens were from pediatric individuals.
The 509 specimens from the apparently healthy population from both low
prevalence (Port Jefferson, NY and Milwaukee, WI) and high prevalence
(Galveston, TX and Phoenix, AZ) areas were obtained from the following
collection locations: 145 (28.49%) from Milwaukee, WI; 140 (27.50%) from
Galveston, TX; 114 (22.40%) from Phoenix, AZ; and 110 (21.61%) from Port
Jefferson, NY. The apparently healthy population (n=509) consisted of the
following race/ethnic groups: 269 (52.85%) Caucasian, 175 (34.38%) African-
American, 40 (7.86%) Hispanic, 11 (2.16%) Asian, 5 (0.98%) American
Indian/Alaska Native, and 9 (1.77%) other. Of the 509 specimens, 358 (70.33%)
were female and 151 (29.67%) were male. The mean age was 44 years (age range:
18 to 81 years).
The distribution of ARCHITECT HAVAB-M reactive, grayzone, and nonreactive
results among apparently healthy individuals (n=255) living in low prevalence

Population at Increased Risk for HAV Infection
Expected results of asymptomatic individuals from the multi-center study
described in “Performance Characteristics” are provided below. The specimens
were from 253 individuals at increased risk of HAV infection due to exposure to
contaminated food or water, poor sanitary conditions or hygiene, household or
sexual contact with an HAV infected individual, recent travel to an HAV endemic
area, lifestyle, behavior, or recipients of clotting factor concentrates.
The increased risk population (n=253) consisted of the following race/ethnic
groups: 140 (55.34%) Caucasian, 48 (18.97%) African-American, 47 (18.58%)
Hispanic, 9 (3.56%) Asian, 3 (1.19%) American Indian/Alaska Native, and 6
(2.37%) other. The 253 specimens from the increased risk population were
obtained from the following collection locations: 64 (25.30%) from Galveston,
TX; 57 (22.53%) from Dallas, TX; 46 (18.18%) from St. Petersburg, FL; 29
(11.46%) from Denver, CO; 23 (9.09%) from Miami, FL; 23 (9.09%) from
Chicago, IL; 7 (2.77%) from Plymouth, MA; and 4 (1.58%) from Colton, CA. Of
the 253 specimens, 155 (61.26%) were male and 98 (38.74%) were female. The
mean age was 42 years (age range: 18 to 78 years).
The distribution of ARCHITECT HAVAB-M reactive, grayzone, and nonreactive
results among individuals with increased risk for HAV (n=253) is summarized by
age and gender in the table below.

Pediatric Population at Low Risk for Hepatitis
One hundred residual specimens from a pediatric population at low risk for
hepatitis were obtained in Fall River, MA. Of the 100 specimens, 66 (66.00%)
were female and 34 (34.00%) were male. The mean age was 12 years (age range:
2 to 18 years).
The distribution of ARCHITECT HAVAB-M reactive, grayzone, and nonreactive
results among pediatric individuals at low risk for hepatitis (n=100) is
