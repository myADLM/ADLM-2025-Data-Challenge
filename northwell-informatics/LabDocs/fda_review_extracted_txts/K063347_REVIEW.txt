• Sample and all AxSYM Anti-CCP reagents required for one test are pipetted
by the Sampling Probe into various wells of a Reaction Vessel (RV).
• AxSYM Line Diluent and sample are pipetted into the Incubation Well of the
RV.
• The AxSYM Anti-CCP Sample Diluent and diluted sample are pipetted into
the Sample Well of the RV.
• The AxSYM Anti-CCP Matrix Cell Blocker is pipetted into the Buffer Well
of the RV.
• The AxSYM Anti-CCP Mouse Anti-Human IgG:Alkaline Phosphatase
Conjugate is pipetted into Reagent Well 3 of the RV.
• AxSYM Line Diluent and CCP-Coated Microparticles are pipetted into
Reagent Well 2 of the RV.
• A reaction mixture is formed by combining diluted sample and diluted
microparticles coated with CCP in Reagent Well 1 of the RV.
• When anti-CCP antibody is present in the sample, it binds to the CCP-Coated
Microparticles, forming antigen-antibody complexes on the microparticles.
• The RV is immediately transferred into the Processing Center. Further
pipetting is done in the Processing Center by the Processing Probe.
PROCESSING CENTER
• An aliquot of Matrix Cell Blocker is transferred to the Matrix Cell.
• An aliquot of the reaction mixture, containing microparticles and bound
antigen-antibody complex, is transferred to the Matrix Cell. The
microparticles bind irreversibly to the glass fiber matrix.
• The Matrix Cell is washed to remove materials not bound to the
microparticles.
• The AxSYM Anti-CCP Mouse Anti-Human IgG:Alkaline Phosphatase
Conjugate is dispensed onto the Matrix Cell and it binds with the antigen-
antibody complexes.
• The Matrix Cell is washed to remove conjugate not bound to the
microparticles.
• The substrate, 4-Methylumbelliferyl Phosphate, is added to the Matrix Cell.
The alkaline phosphatase-labeled conjugate catalyzes the removal of a
phosphate group from the substrate, yielding the fluorescent product, 4-
Methylumbelliferone. This fluorescent product is measured by the MEIA
optical assembly.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Four samples covering the measuring range of the device were assayed in
replicates of two at two separate times of the day for twenty days (n=80).
Testing was performed on two AxSYM Systems, using one reagent lot. The
precision acceptance criteria for total %CV and within-run %CV was <15%.
Data from the studies are summarized below:
5

N Mean Within run Total
(mg/dL) %CV %CV
80 5.2 6.9 9.3
80 4.3 10.7 11.1
80 13.8 7.1 8.4
80 15.0 5.7 7.7
80 24.4 7.0 8.6
80 25.6 6.6 8.3
80 139.8 6.8 10.0
80 149.7 7.1 8.5
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was demonstrated by testing five high patient sample pools,
with anti-CCP concentrations between 100 and 200 U/mL. These samples
were serially diluted with AxSYM Anti-CCP Negative control at the
following dilutions: 1:2, 1:4, 1:6, 1:8, and 1:10. Each dilution was assayed in
triplicate and a median is calculated. Data was analyzed using linear
regression analysis (x-axis: expected concentration and y-axis: actual
concentration). The data showed the following regression equation:
Sample Pool 1 y = 1.0842x +2.3294, r2 =0.991
Sample Pool 2 y = 1.0025x + 4.6563, r2 = 0.9873
Sample Pool 3 y = 0.9507x + 6.6989, r2 = 0.9869
Sample Pool 4 y = 1.0288x + 3.1923, r2 = 0.9813
Sample Pool 5 y = 1.000x + 1.9658, r2 = 0.9903
The AxSYM Anti-CCP assay showed linearity from 0 to 200 U/mL.
In addition, an automated dilution protocol was designed to assist in
quantitation of test results using the AxSYM system. The AxSYM system
performs a 1:10 dilution of the specimen prior to analysis. The system
automatically calculates the concentration of the diluted specimen and reports
the result. Five high sample pools were used in this study. Each sample was
diluted manually and auto-dilute using Anti-CCP Negative Control. The
assay was designed to have a mean auto-dilute recovery of 100 ± 20%. The %
recoveries for the five sample pools were 107.3, 90.0, 86.3, 91.3, 100.2, and
95.0. The results support the use of both automated and manual 1:10 dilution
for the AxSYM Anti-CCP assay.
High dose hook effect
The possibility of high dose hook effect occurring when using the device was
evaluated with two serum samples with concentrations above the assay range
(1200U/mL and 2400 U/mL). The samples were analyzed on two AxSYM
instruments in triplicate with two reagent lots. No hook effect was observed
at concentrations 12 times that of Calibrator F (200 U/mL).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
An international reference material for anti-CCP antibodies is not available.
The calibrators and controls are assigned relative arbitrary Axis-Shield units
(U/mL).
The AxSYM Anti-CCP Reference Calibrators were manufactured using a
pool of high titer anti-CCP positive plasmas that has been assigned a value in
U/mL. The AxSYM Anti-CCP Standard Calibrators were prepared from an
anti-CCP stock (positive plasma) diluted in Calibrator diluent. This is tested
by rate matching to the Reference Calibrator and should be within the target
range of ± 2.5%. If acceptable, this becomes Calibrator F and is then further
diluted to produce calibrators B-E.
Storage conditions
The AxSYM Anti-CCP Reagent Pack must be stored at 2-8°C. When stored
and handled as directed, reagents are stable until the expiration date.
d. Detection limit:
The AxSYM assay is designed to have a mean analytical sensitivity/limit of
blank (LoB) of ≤ 1.0 U/mL. The LoB was calculated as the concentration at
the 95th percentile above the Standard Calibrator A (0.0 U/mL) and was found
to be 0.067 U/mL. The design specification (≤ 1.0 U/mL) was met.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference: Interference testing was performed using guidance supplied by
CLSI EP7-A, “Interference testing in Clinical Chemistry”. No significant
interference was observed in:
• Hemoglobin up to 500 mg/dL
• Bilirubin up to 20 mg/dL
• Triglycerides up to 1500 mg/dL
• Total Protein up to 12 g/dL
• Rheumatoid Factor up to 200 IU/mL
• RBC up to 0.4%
Crossreactivity
To assess the potential cross-reactivity of the CCP antigen used in the
AxSYM Anti-CCP assay with other autoantibodies, the assay was evaluated
with 16 samples, all with high levels of various autoantibodies and negative
for CCP. The following autoantibodies (2 samples each) were tested: SSA,
SSB, RNP, dsDNA, Jo-1, and Ribosomal-P. The study showed no significant
cross-reactivity of the CCP antigen with any of these autoantibodies.
f. Assay cut-off:
See Expected Value.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity
Using the same samples from the method comparison study, % sensitivity and
specificity were calculated. The following results were obtained:
Disease N Anti-CCP positive %Sensitivity % Specificity

All RA

samples
All Non-
RA 402 22 94.5
samples
The lower sensitivity of 72.2% was accepted for the following reasons:
1. Anti-CCP assays from different manufacturers showed variable ranges
from 69% to 87.8%.
2. Literature showed sensitivity ranging from 65% to 85% in established
RA depending on cohort tested.
