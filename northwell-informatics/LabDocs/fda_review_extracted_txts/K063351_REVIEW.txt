EP5A2. Precision of the system was demonstrated by assaying the low and
high kit controls, low, medium and high serum pool specimens, and low and
high plasma pool specimens for the Dimension Vista™ CYSC Assay.
Specimens at each level were analyzed in duplicate, twice a day, for 20 days
(n = 80). The repeatability and within-lab standard deviation (SD) and percent
coefficient of variation (%CV) were calculated by the analysis of variance
method. The data are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The measuring range is 0.23 to 8.0 mg/L. Linearity across the assay range was
confirmed by testing a calibrator with a high concentration of cystatin C. This
calibrator was serially diluted with System diluent (8.75 to 0.16 mg/L). Each
dilution was tested in replicates of three. Data were analyzed using linear
regression analysis. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria of a slope between 0.9
and 1.1 and a correlation coefficient ≥ 0.95 were met. A summary of the
linearity data is presented the table below.
Dimension Vista™ N Slope Intercept Correlation Coefficient
CYSC 6 1.018 0.014 0.999
Hook Effect:
The possibility of hook effect occurring when using the Dimension Vista™
CYSC assay was evaluated by the sponsor with serum samples above the
assay range. The samples were analyzed on both the predicate BN ProSpec®
System and the Dimension Vista® System, indicating no hook affect up to
13.9 mg/L. The summary of the hook effect data are presented below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The traceability of the calibrators and controls are referenced to ERM® -
DA470 (CRM 470) and highly purified proteins with value assignment of the
commercial lot versus master calibrator or control. Three reference curves, 4
runs, 3 vials, 4 replicates per vial tested on two nephelometric instruments for
a total of 144 values.
Protein 3 Calibrator Stability:
The Protein 3 Calibrator stability was determined per pre-approved test protocol
by Dade Behring. A 24 month study with 3 vials, 3 replicates per vial was
performed. The calibrator was stored at +2 to +8°C throughout the testing cycle
and tested on day 0 and after 12, 18, and 24 months. Stress testing was
performed after storage for 6 months at +2 to +8°C; the calibrator was stored at
+37°C for 2 weeks and tested after 1 and 2 weeks storage. Open and punctured
vial stability was tested after having reached 50% of shelf life stability, vials
were stored on board the instrument and contents were tested in duplicates on
day 0, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 14. The sponsor’s established shelf life stability criteria
are results obtained must be within a range of 85 to 115% of the control
assigned value. The sponsor’s established open and punctured vial stability
criteria are results obtained must not deviate more than ± 10% compared to day
0 results.
Cystatin C Control L and H Stability:
The Cystatin C Control L and H stability was determined per pre-approved test
protocol by Dade Behring. A 24 month study with 3 vials, 3 replicates per vial
was performed. The controls were stored at +2 to +8°C throughout the testing
cycle and tested on day 0 and after 12, 18, and 24 months. Stress testing was
performed after storage for 6 months at +2 to +8°C; the controls were stored at
+37°C for 2 weeks and tested after 1 and 2 weeks storage. Open and punctured
vial stability was tested after having reached 50% of shelf life stability, vials
were stored on board the instrument and contents were tested in duplicates on
day 0, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 14. The sponsor’s established shelf life stability criteria
are results obtained must be within a range of 85 to 115% of the control
assigned value. The sponsor’s established open and punctured vial stability

criteria are results obtained must not deviate more than ± 10% compared to day

d. Detection limit:
The sponsor defined analytical sensitivity as the minimal detectable level of
analyte, which can be distinguished from zero. In a representative study the
value was calculated as the mean value of twenty replicates of System Diluent
plus two standard deviations. In this study, the mean analytical sensitivity was
calculated as 0.0038 mg/L. The claimed low end of assay range is 0.23 mg/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor conducted interference studies to evaluate the effect of various
endogenous and exogenous substances on the Dimension Vista™ CYSC
assay. Interference testing was performed according to CLSI/NCCLS EP7-A.
The sponsors established acceptance criteria are a bias exceeding ± 10% was
considered a significant interference. For each spiked sample, the % recovery
was determined [% Recovery = (Test result/ Baseline) x 100]. The acceptance
criterion of ± 10% relative deviation from the base pool was met for all
interferents tested. The results are presented in the table below.
Substance Concentration Cystatin C concentration Bias in %
Hemoglobin 1000 mg/dL 0.94 mg/L + 3
(hemolysate)
Bilirubin (unconjugated) 60 mg/dL 0.93 mg/L +2
Bilirubin (conjugated) 60 mg/dL 0.93 mg/L +1
Lipemia (triglycerides) 1071 mg/dL 0.83 mg/L -4
Method comparison studies were run on BN ProSpec® (BNPS) versus the
Dimension Vista® System, to determine total protein and rheumatoid factor
interference. For these studies serum sample preparations (n ≥ 25) with 12
g/dL (120 g/L) protein and 500 IU/mL RF were used. The median for the
normalized difference in % was required to be within ± 7% and the correlation
coefficient ≥ 0.95. These studies demonstrated correlation and equivalent
performance between the Dade Behring N Latex Cystatin C Kit and the
Dimension Vista™ CYSC assay.

N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
