I. Device Description:
The Stratus® CS Acute Care™ D-Dimer (DDMR) TestPak is an in vitro diagnostic
test for the quantitative determination of D-Dimer in human plasma. The principle of
assay is based on solid phase Radial Partition Immunoassay (RPIA) technology.
Elevated concentrations of D-Dimer are indicative of the presence of a clot and have
been reported in DVT, PE, DIC, during pregnancy, use of contraceptives, increased
age, and trauma.
The D-dimer TestPak is used in conjunction with Stratus® CS Acute Care™ D-dimer
(DDMR) CalPak and Stratus® CS Acute Care™ D-dimer (DDMR) DilPak to perform
the D-dimer assay, calibration, and quality control on the Stratus® CS STAT
Fluorometric Analyzer.
The Stratus® CS Acute Care™ D-dimer method uses whole blood collected in lithium
heparin or sodium citrate. Samples are automatically processed by the analyzer via
centrifugation. The plasma obtained after centrifugation is used in the analysis.
Heparinized or citrated plasma dispensed in a sample cups can also be used by this
method. The instrument automatically calculates and prints the concentration of
D-dimer in ng/mL [µg/L] FEU. The D-dimer assay range is 6-5000 ng/ml [µg/L]
FEU, samples between 5000 and 17,500 ng/mL [µg/L] FEU may be run using a
D-dimer DilPak along with a D-dimer TestPak. The instrument will automatically
perform a dilution of the sample.
Samples with D-dimer concentration in excess of 17,500 ng/mL [µg/L] FEU can be
tested after manually diluting the sample with normal saline. Manual dilution is not
recommended for healthcare professionals in the Point of Care (POC) setting and the
results should be reported as >17,500 ng/ml [µg/L] FEU.

L. Test Principle:
Method: It is a two-site sandwich assay based upon solid phase Radial Partition
Immunoassay (RPIA) technology. Dendrimer linked monoclonal antibody is then
added to the center portion of a square piece of glass fiber paper in the TestPak. This
antibody recognizes a distinct antigenic site on the D-Dimer molecule. Sample is
then added onto the paper where it reacts with the immobilized antibody. A
conjugate, consisting of enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody directed against a
second distinct antigenic site on the D-dimer molecule, is added onto the reaction
zone of the paper. The enzyme-labeled antibody reacts with the bound D-Dimer,
forming an antibody-antigen-labeled antibody sandwich. Then the unbound labeled
antibody is eluted from the reaction zone. The initiation of the enzyme activity
occurs simultaneously with the wash since substrate for the enzyme was included in
the wash solution. The enzymatic rate of the bound fraction increases directly with
the concentration of the D-Dimer in the sample. The reaction rate is then be
measured by an optical system that monitors the reaction rate via front surface
fluorescence. The microprocessor within the analyzer performs all data analysis.
Calibrator: The D-dimer CalPak contains D-dimer in a liquid buffered bovine protein
matrix which contains one calibrator level at an approximate concentration of 3500
ng/mL in each of three wells. The kit consists of five CalPaks at a single calibrator
level and is used for calibration of the Stratus® CS Acute Care™ method.
Diluent: The D-dimer DilPak contains a liquid buffered bovine protein matrix which
is used in conjunction with the D-dimer TestPak for the measurement of samples with
elevated levels of D-Dimer.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision analysis was performed to support the addition of Point of Care
(POC) to the indication for use. The testing was completed at three different
locations: Clinical Laboratory (LAB), Emergency Department (ED), and
Cardiac Care Unit (CCU) at three external sites.
Two levels of plasma pools were performed in replicates of four over a period
of five days (N=20) by LAB, ED, and CCU personnel on the Status
instruments located in their respective areas. ED and CCU personnel had no
formal laboratory training. Within-Run (WR) and total coefficients of
variation (%CV) were calculated according to the NCCLS EP-15A.
