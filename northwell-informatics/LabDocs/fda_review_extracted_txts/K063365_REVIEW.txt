H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
MicroScan® Synergies plus™ Gram-Positive panels, with gentamicin, are intended
for determination of susceptibility of Gram-positive enterococci and staphylococci to
the antimicrobial gentamicin. For use with MicroScan® Synergies plus™ Panels read
on the WalkAway® -SI System (including upgraded WalkAway® -40 or
WalkAway® -96 to meet WalkAway® SI equivalence).
2. Indication(s) for use:
MicroScan® Synergies plus™ Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel is used to determine
quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on
solid media, of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-positive
enterococci and staphylococci.
The testing of gentamicin at concentrations of 0.06 – 2 µg/mL on the MicroScan®
Synergies plus™ Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel is indicated for testing
staphylococci at 4.5-16 hours or 16-20 hours for an overnight reading. The Gram-
positive organisms which may be tested on this panel are Staphylococcus species
(coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative).
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Turbidity method of inoculum preparation only.
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
Each panel contains two control wells: a negative control well, and a growth control well
(contains test medium without antibiotic). Antibiotics are diluted in water, buffer, or
minute concentrations of broth to selected concentrations prior to dehydration of the
panels. The panel is rehydrated and inoculated at the same time with 0.1 mL of
suspension prepared by the turbidity method (inoculum prepared in 0.4% saline with a
very small amount (0.1%) of Pluronic®--a wetting agent), then 0.1 mL transferred to 25
mL of inoculum Synergies plus Pos Broth with Pluronic® for a final inoculum
concentration of 3-7 X 105 CFU/mL. Panels are incubated in a Walk-Away® System
and read periodically starting at 4.5 hours until sufficient growth to determine the MIC
(Minimum Inhibitory Concentration). Alternately, the panels may be incubated at 35o C
in a non-CO for 16-24 hours and read by visual observation of growth.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST)
Guidance for Industry and FDA”; Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M7
(M100-S16) “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That
Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
The WalkAway® SI uses a Colorimetric Optics System consisting of a color wheel/lamp
assembly and a Photosensor. There is an initial read at 2.5 hours with a possible final
read at 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 8, 12, 16 or 18 hours (overnight instrument readings, manual
readings) depending on the growth rate of the organism being tested. The time of final
read is dependent on the user customization, the growth rate of the organism, and the
sensitivity of the automatic reader since cell densities below 2 x 107 cells/ml are not
detected.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Data on the gram-positive panel for Gentamicin at 0.06 – 2 µg/mL were evaluated. The
Synergies plus™ readings were obtained at times between 4.5 and 16 hours of incubation
(Rapid read method). An additional comparison was done with readings on the
instrument after 16 – 18 hours incubation for the Overnight Instrument read method, and
also for the Overnight Manual read method, when incubated 16- 18 hours and read
visually.
This submission is for the AST Panel only. The ID System was not reviewed.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates tested at 3 sites on 3 separate
days in triplicate. The study included the testing on the WalkAway® SI read at
<16 hours, WalkAway® 16-18 hour readings and manual readings at 16-20 hours
incubation. All results were >95% reproducible for all reading methods.
There appears to be a slight trend for the Rapid read method to produce more
resistant results.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC isolate was tested a sufficient number of times with
acceptable results on most testing days with the reference method. The percent
QC results that did not grow in the 4.5-16 hour window was 0% for the E. faecalis
ATCC 29212 and 2% for the S. aureus ATCC 29213.

E. faecalis ATCC 29212 QC performance: The modes each of the reading
methods for the Microscan results are more susceptible than the mode for the
reference method result, if only by one dilution.
S. aureus ATCC 29213 QC performance: The modes each of the reading
methods for the Microscan results are more susceptible than the mode for the
reference method result, if only by one dilution. There were 93.8% (92/99) test
panel in range results for the Instrument Overnight reading method due to
“skipped wells”, which were verified manually. The test panel in range results for
the Rapid read method and the Manual Overnight read method were both >95%
acceptable, respectively.
No QC trending was observed.
Inoculum density control: A turbidity meter was used for the turbidity inoculation

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical testing was conducted at 3 sites. A total of 301 Clinical Gram-positive
isolates were tested of which 267 were fresh isolates and 34 were stock isolates.
Four (4) isolates were reported at >= 16 hours and were not included as Rapid
read results. Therefore, of the 301 isolates tested, 297 Rapid read Long Dilution
isolates were analyzed. There were 75 challenge isolates tested at one site and
compared to the reference broth dilution result mode that was determined by
previous testing of each isolate multiple times in the recommended reference
panel. The Synergies plus™ readings were obtained at times between 4.5 and 16
hours of incubation for > 95% of the results. An additional comparison was done
with readings on the instrument after overnight incubation and also read manually
when incubated 16- 18 hours. Performance by these alternate reading methods
was also acceptable with no apparent differences or trends.
The recommended CLSI reference method was followed with the exception of the
use of a small amount (0.1%) Pluronic® (a wetting agent) in the final inoculum.
A validation of the use of Pluronic® in the frozen reference panels was
conducted. Similar calculations for the different reading methods were performed
with very little difference.
QC was also performed with no difference apparent in the results. The chart
below demonstrates the performance of all three reading methods (Synergies
plus™ readings at <16 hours, overnight on the WalkAway® and manually read at
18 hours using the touchScan®-SR) when compared to the reference method.

EA-Essential Agreement maj-major discrepancies
CA-Category Agreement vmj-very major discrepancies
R-resistant isolates min- minor discrepancies
Essential agreement (EA) is when the MicroScan® Synergies plus
panel agrees with the reference test panel results exactly or within one
doubling dilution of the reference method. Category agreement (CA)
is when the MicroScan® Synergies plus panel interpretation agrees
exactly with the reference panel interpretation. Evaluable (Eval) are
results that are within the test range and on scale.
The device had a growth rate of >95%.
Of the 75 Challenge isolates tested, the expected results for 39 strains were
Susceptible, 3 strains were Intermediate, and 33 strains were Resistant. There
were 4 minor errors (4/73, 5.5%) generated in the Challenge Set data, using the
<16 hr Rapid reading method, but there were no vmj or maj errors produced. The
overall combined EA and the CA for the Clinical and Challenge Set data were
>90% for all read methods, and the overall performance data are acceptable.
Performance claims (in bold) that will appear in the labeling and the procedural
manual are based on the Clinical data Rapid read (<16 hour) method results only.
The table below displays the clinical data results compared by reading method.

The Clinical data Rapid read method EA of 94.6% and the CA of 97.0% are both
very good. Overnight Instrument and Manual read methods EA and CA are both
similar to the Rapid read method results for the Long Dilution data.
The 2 vmj (2/40, 5%) were generated by two S. aureus isolates tested at two
different sites generated by the Rapid read method. Because of the low number of
resistant isolates, the overall vmj error rate appears to be elevated. Further
analysis of these 2 isolates demonstrated that there appeared to be a problem with
the entire antibiogram.
There appears to be a slight trend for the device to produce more susceptible
results as compared to the reference method. This trend was not noted in the
reproducibility data, where the results for the <16 hour readings were slightly
more resistant.
