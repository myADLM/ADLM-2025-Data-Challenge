(CLSI) M7 (M100-S16) “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for
Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
The WalkAway® SI uses a Colorimetric Optics System consisting of a color wheel/lamp
assembly and a Photosensor. There is an initial read at 2.5 hours with a possible final read at
4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 8, 12, 16 or 18 hours (overnight instrument readings, manual readings),
depending on the growth rate of the organism being tested. The time of final read is
dependent on the user customization, the growth rate of the organism, and the sensitivity of
the automatic reader since cell densities below 2 x 107 cells/ml are not detected.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Data on the gram-positive panel for Synercid at 0.12 —8 µg/mL (Long Dilution Sequence)
and Synercid at 0.12 — 2 µg/mL (5-Dilution Breakpoint Sequence) were evaluated. The
Synergies plus™ readings were obtained at times between 4.5 and 16 hours of incubation
(Rapid read method). An additional comparison was done with readings on the instrument
after 16 – 18 hours incubation for the Overnight Instrument read method, and also for the
Overnight Manual read method, when incubated 16- 18 hours and read visually.
This submission is for the AST Panel only. The ID System was not reviewed.

days in triplicate. The study included the testing on the WalkAway® SI read
at <16 hours, WalkAway® 16-18 hour readings and manual readings at 16-20 hours
incubation. The overall reproducibility results were >95% reproducible for the Long
Dilution Sequence and the 5-Dilution Breakpoint Sequence.
There was a slight trend for the <16 hour reading method to produce more susceptible
results.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC isolates were tested a sufficient number of times with
acceptable results on most testing days with the reference method.
The percent that did not grow in the 4.5-16 hour window for the E. faecalis QC
organism was 0%; the percent that did not grow in the 4.5-16 hour window for the
S. aureus QC organism was 2%. Quality control results demonstrated the ability of
the different reading parameters (manual and instrument) to produce acceptable
results >95% of the time.

2. Comparison studies:
The gram-positive Efficacy Study data were analyzed for both the seven (7) well Long
Dilution Sequence (0.12 – 8 µg/mL) and the five (5) well 5-Dilution Breakpoint Sequence
(0.12 – 2 µg/mL) for enterococci and staphylococci, for which clearance is requested. The
dilutions provide on-scale results for at least 1 of the CLSI gram-positive Quality Control
strains. Performance claims are based on Rapid read method (<16 hours) results compared to
the reference method overnight results.
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical testing was conducted at 3 sites. A total of 350 Clinical gram-positive
isolates were tested of which 308 were fresh isolates and 42 were stock isolates.
Seven (7) isolates for the Long Dilution Sequence and the Breakpoint Dilution
Sequence were reported at >= 16 hours and were not included as Rapid read results.
Therefore, of the 350 isolates tested, 343 Rapid read Long Dilution isolates were
analyzed. There were 75 challenge isolates tested at one site and compared to the
reference broth dilution result mode that was determined by previous testing of each
isolate multiple times in the recommended reference panel. Two (2) isolates for the
Long Dilution Sequence and one (1) Challenge isolate for the 5-Breakpoint Dilution
Sequence were reported at ≥ 16 hour and were not included in the Rapid Read
Method results.
The Synergies plus™ readings were obtained at times between 4.5 and 16 hours of
incubation for > 95% of the results. An additional comparison was done with
readings on the instrument after overnight incubation and also read manually when
incubated 16- 18 hours. Performance by these alternate reading methods was also
acceptable with no apparent differences or trends.
The recommended CLSI reference method was followed with the exception of the use
of a small amount (0.1%) of Pluronic® (a wetting agent) in the final inoculum. A
validation of the use of Pluronic® in the frozen reference panels was conducted.
Similar calculations for the different reading methods were performed with very little
difference.

--- Page 8 ---
QC was also performed with no difference apparent in the results. The chart below
demonstrates the performance of all three reading methods (Synergies plus™
readings at <16 hours, overnight on the WalkAway® and manually read at 18 hours
using the touchScan®-SR) when compared to the reference method for both dilution
sequences.

EA-Essential Agreement maj-major discrepancies
CA-Category Agreement vmj-very major discrepancies
R-resistant isolates min- minor discrepancies
NA – Essential Agreement results are not applicable for Breakpoint format
Essential agreement (EA) is when the MicroScan® Synergies plus panel
agrees with the reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling
dilution of the reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the
MicroScan® Synergies plus panel interpretation agrees exactly with the
reference panel interpretation. Evaluable (Eval) are results that are within
the test range and on scale.
Of the 75 Challenge isolates tested, the expected results for 74 strains were Susceptible
and 1 strain was Intermediate. Two (2) isolates for the Long Dilution Sequence and one
(1) Challenge isolate for the 5-Breakpoint Dilution Sequence were reported at ≥ 16 hour
and were not included in the Rapid Read Method results.
There were no very major or maj errors in the Challenge Set data. One min error was
generated by one Enterococcus faecium (vancomycin susceptible) for the <16 hour Rapid
read method. One E. faecium (vancomycin resistant) and one S. aureus (methicillin-
resistant) isolate generated two minor errors in the Overnight Instrument and Overnight
Manual reading methods, for the Long Dilution and the 5-Dilution Breakpoint Sequence
data, respectively. The overall combined EA and the CA for the Challenge Set Data was
>90% for all read methods and dilution combinations. Therefore, the Challenge Set
performance data are acceptable.

The Clinical data Rapid read method EA of 97.1% and the CA of 97.7% are both very
good. Overnight Instrument and Manual read methods EA and CA are both very similar
to the Rapid read method results for the Long Dilution and the 5-Dilution Breakpoint
Sequence data results.
There were 3 vmj errors (3/4, 75%) produced by 3 different Staphylococcus species at
two different sites, generated only by the Rapid read method. Because of the low number
of resistant isolates, the overall vmj error rates appear to be elevated. Further analysis of
these 3 isolates demonstrated that there appeared to be a problem with the entire
antibiogram.
The 1 vmj (1/4, 25%) generated in the Overnight Instrument read method results was
produced by 1 Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-resistant) isolate. Because this
organism group will not be reported for this antibiotic/organism combination, this result
may be considered to have minimal impact on the overall performance, since the EA and
CA are very good.
There appears to be a trend for the device to produce a slightly more resistant result as
compared to the reference method, if only by one dilution, but still remaining within EA.
This trend was not observed in the reproducibility study, but was demonstrated in the QC
performance data for both organism strains.
The EA and the CA are within acceptable limits for all reading methods, and the CA for
