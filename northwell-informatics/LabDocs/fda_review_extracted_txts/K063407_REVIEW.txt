510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
K063407
B. Purpose for Submission:
This is an original-traditional 510(k) for a 16 parameter automated hematology
analyzer and leukocyte differential cell counter with reagents, calibrator, and controls.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Shenzhen Mindray Bio-Medical Electronics Co. LTD, BC-3200 Auto Hematology
Analyzer
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
WBC, Lymph #, Mid#, Gran#, Lymph%, Mid%, Gran%, RBC, HGB, MCV, MCH,
MCHC, RDW, HCT, MPV, and WBC Histogram, RBC Histogram, and PLT
Histogram
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The BC-3200 Auto Hematology Analyzer is a quantitative, automated
hematology analyzer and leukocyte differential cell counter for In Vitro
Diagnostic use in clinical laboratories. It is only to be used by trained medical
professionals to identify the normal patient, with all normal system-generated
parameters, and toflag or identify patient results that require additional studies.
The analyzer provides analysis results of 16 parameter of human blood and three
histograms.
2. Principles of Operation:
WBCs are counted and sized by the impedence method. This method is based on
the measurement of changes in electrical resistance produced by a particle, which
in this case is a blood cell suspended in a conductive diluent as it passes through
an aperture of known dimensions. HGB is determined by the colorimetric method.
RBCs and PLTs are counted by the impedence method also. In addition, for RBCs
and Plts, volumetric metering is used. An accurate cell count cannot be obtained
unless the precise volume of diluted sample that passes through the aperture
during the count cycle is known. The analyzer uses a volumetric metering unit to
1

--- Page 2 ---
control the count cycle and to ensure that a precise volume of sample is analyzed
for the measurement.
3. Modes of Operation:
Closed Vial Whole Blood Mode, Whole Blood Mode for veinous blood, and
Predilute Mode for capillary blood.
4. Specimen Identification:
Barcode or manual keyboard entry.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Samples are manually loaded into a sample compartment one at a time. The BC-
3200 utilizes an automatic sampling and mixing device for sample processing.
The Mindray calibrator is called SC-CAL PLUS.
6. Calibration:
The device has two calibration programs: manual calibration and auto calibration
using commercial calibrators. The Mindray calibrator is called SC-CAL PLUS.
7. Quality Control:
The device has two QC programs: L-J Analysis and X-B Analysis. The Mindray
three level control is called BC-3D.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility is stated in terms of both Standard Deviation (SD) and
Coefficient of Variation (CV%). Reproducibility was determined by replicate
testing (n = 11) with samples of low, normal and high concentrations, three
samples for each concentration. For each sample, results of the 2nd to 11th
runs were adopted to calculate the SD and CV%.

Inter-laboratory Precision:
Two laboratories, each having one BC-3200 installed, were selected for the
test. Three samples of various concentrations (respectively low, normal and
high) were prepared, each with sufficient volume to run twice on both of the
BC-3200s. Each BC-3200 was operated by one operator, who conducted the
test from beginning to the end. Each sample was divided into two aliquots,
and the two aliquots were analyzed respectively by the two selected
laboratories within the same day of preparation. Each aliquot was run twice on
the BC-3200 and both runs were conducted within a short interval. No outlier
was found during the test. Based on the data acquired, repeatability variance
(S r2), between laboratory variance (Sj2), and reproducibility variance (S 2) of
R
the following parameters, WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, Lymph%, Mid% and
Gran%,, were calculated for ea concentration.

c. Linearity:
Linearity was determined by running diluted samples. RBC,HGB are diluted by
blood plasma of the sample, while WBC and PLT are diluted by specified diluent.
Concentrations from 0 to 100% were tested, each concentration twice. The
average of the two runs is taken as the result, together with the concentration, to
calculate per the linear regression equation.

d. Carryover:
Carryover was determined by first running the high concentration sample for
three consecutive times (i1, i2, i3) and then the low concentration sample
three consecutive times (j1, j2, j3), and finally calculating per the following
equation: Carryover (%) = [(j1 – j3)/ (i3-j3)]×100%. The test was then
repeated using the high level control.
