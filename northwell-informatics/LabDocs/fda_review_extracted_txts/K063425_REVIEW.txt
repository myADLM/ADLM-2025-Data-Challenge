K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices; Approved
Guideline: EP5-A, CLSI Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved
Guideline EP7-A2.
L. Test Principle:
Polystyrene particles coated with antibodies specific to human IgE are aggregated
when mixed with samples containing IgE. These aggregates scatter a beam of light
passed through a sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the
concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by
comparison with a standard of known concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility: Precision testing was done in accordance with
CLSI Approved Guideline EP5-A2. Controls (PROT1 CON L, M, and H) and
six samples (4 derived from serum pools and 2 derived from plasma pools),
representing IgE concentrations across the measuring range and near the
clinical decision points, were analyzed in duplicate, for 20 days, two times per
day. The repeatability and within-lab standard deviations (SD) and percent
coefficient of variation (% CV) were calculated. Repeatability imprecision
was <3.5%, and within-lab imprecision was <7.0%.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Linearity across the assay measuring range
(18 - 1150 IU/mL) was confirmed by testing a calibrator with a high
concentration of immunoglobulin E. The calibrator was serially diluted with
System Diluent in 5, approximately two-fold increments. The range of IgE
values in the study was 14.7 to 1368.7 IU/mL. Each dilution was tested in
replicates of three. Data were analyzed using linear regression analysis. The
acceptance criteria for confidence intervals around the slope (0.9 and 1.1) and
correlation coefficient (>0.95) were met. Regression analysis of theoretical
concentration versus measured concentration produced the following results:
Slope Intercept R n
0.951 14.490 0.996 21
The method used to fit the linear regression line was Passing-Bablok.
Recovery of protein reference material 2nd IRP 75/502 ranged from 98.7 –
100.6 % with a mean recovery of 100.0 %.
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
The Calibrator is referenced to the second international reference preparation
for human serum IgE, 2nd IRP 75/502. Detailed description of the value
assignments for Calibrator and Controls was provided.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical sensitivity was determined by assaying analyte-free System Diluent
20 times and determining the mean value plus two SDs: 0.953 IU/mL.
Package insert states the limit of detection represents the lower limit of the
reportable range and is reported as 3.6 IU/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Interference Studies: Interference testing was performed according to CLSI
EP7-A2, to determine the effect of various endogenous and exogenous
substances on the Dimension Vista™ IgE assay. For the following
interferents, the percent bias was determined by testing a control sample
without the interferent and comparing it to the value obtained from a test
sample to which the potential interferent was added: bilirubin (conjugated
and unconjugated, 60 mg/dL), hemoglobin (1000 mg/dL), creatinine (30
mg/dL), albumin (6 g/dL), urea (500 mg/dL), cholesterol (500 mg/dL), uric
acid (20 mg/dL). Sample concentrations represented the lowest and highest
clinical decision points ~15 IU/mL and ~260- 310 IU/mL. Interference
(<9%) was within the acceptance criteria ±10%. Triglyceride interference

was evaluated by testing five samples containing known amount of
triglyceride and comparing the results to the same sample after
centrifugation. The study demonstrated that clarified samples produced the
same results as original samples (% CV < 6%) but did not demonstrate that
assay performance is not affected by triglycerides since the baseline IgE
concentrations in these samples without triglycerides were not known. A
statement that lipemic samples should be avoided was placed in the
specimen handling section. Additionally, 41 potentially interfering drugs
were also assayed and shown to exhibit minimal interference (<10%).
ii. Cross-reactivity with autoimmune antibodies common to other systemic
autoimmune diseases was not tested.
iii. Antigen Excess: The effect of antigen excess was evaluated using a serum
sample with a high concentration of IgE (above the assay range). No
prozone effect was observed up to at least 34,327 IU/mL. Samples whose
values exceed 1150 IU/mL using the initial 1:20 dilution are reported as
“exceeds assay range” to alert the user to repeat the assay using a higher
dilution.
f. Assay cut-off:
See Expected Values.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Information regarding age and clinical status of the samples are not available.
The Dimension Vista™ IGE assay was compared to the Dade Behring N
Latex IgE mono assay on the BN ProSpec ® System by evaluating 68 serum
and 52 plasma samples with concentrations ranging from 18.2 IU/mL to
1126.5 IU/mL. Regression analysis of these results yielded the following
results:

b. Matrix comparison:
Ten matched samples of serum, EDTA, lithium heparin and sodium heparin
plasma containing concentrations of IgE spanning the measuring range (25.88
to 923.73 IU/mL), were assayed and compared. Regression analysis between
the four matrices yielded the following information:

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a and b are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
See Expected values.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Neonates < 1.5 IU/mL
Infants in first year of life < 15 IU/mL
Children (1 - 5 years) < 60 IU/mL
Children (6 - 9 years) < 90 IU/mL
Children (10 - 15 years) < 200 IU/mL
Adults < 100 IU/mL
These reference values were established using an EIA method in a
comprehensive study (448 children, 200 adults) conducted in Europe. In
clinically healthy adult subjects, IgE levels exhibit a wide distribution range
and do not follow a normal distribution.
IgE concentrations in children are highly dependent on age. Adult values are
achieved at about 7 to 10 years of age. Higher values occur at about 10 to 15
years of age. Concentrations of up to approximately 100 IU/mL in adults can
be considered the upper limit of the reference range.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
