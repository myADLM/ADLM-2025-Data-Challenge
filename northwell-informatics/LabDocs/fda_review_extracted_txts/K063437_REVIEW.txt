L. Test Principle:
The Monobind AccuBind Neo-TSH Microwell Elisa Assay is a solid phase two-site
immunoenzymometric assay based on the direct sandwich technique in which two
specific antibodies are directed against two separate antigenic determinants on the
hTSH molecule. In this method, TSH dried whole blood calibrator, patient specimen,
or control is first added to a streptavidin coated well. Elution buffer containing
biotinylated monoclonal antibodies are added and the reactants mixed. Reaction
between the biotinylated anti-TSH and the TSH in the dried blood spot forms a
complex that binds to the streptavidin coated to the well due to the inherent affinity of
streptavidin and biotin. After the completion of the first incubation period, excess
reactants are washed off via a wash step and the enzyme conjugate (another specific
anti-TSH antibody linked to an enzyme) is added to the Ag-Ab complex deposited on
the plastic surface. The enzyme labeled anti-TSH antibody binds to the TSH making
a sandwich complex with two antibodies bound to the antigen during a second
incubation. The microplate is washed to remove unreacted enzyme. Finally, the
activity of the enzyme present on the surface of the well is quantitated by reaction
with a substrate to produce color. The color is measured with a microplate
spectrophotometer. The enzyme activity on the well is directly proportional to the
TSH concentration in the dried blood spot. By utilizing several different dried spots
of known antigen concentration, a dose response cure can be generated from which
the antigen concentration of an unknown can be ascertained.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The inter- and intra-assay precision of the AccuBind Neo-TSH Microwell
Elisa Assay was determined by analyses of three different levels of three
pooled human whole blood spotted controls. The number mean values,
standard deviations (SD) and coefficient of variation for each of these control
sera are presented below:
Intra-assay: twenty replicates of each of three pooled human blood spotted
controls (low, medium, and high levels of TSH) were assayed in the same
assay. An intra-assay precision of 5.1 – 8.6% was obtained:
Low pool Medium pool High pool
Number (n) 20 20 20
Mean 10.6 43.3 87.1
1 SD 0.91 3.61 4.42
% CV 8.6 8.3 5.1
Inter-assay: one duplicate of each of three pooled human blood spotted
controls (low, medium and high levels of TSH) was assayed in 10 assays done

over a period of six months that involved five different sets of reagents and
three different technicians. An inter-assay precision of 6.0-10.8% was
obtained.
Low pool Medium pool High pool
Number (n) 10 10 10
Mean 11.05 42.22 85.10
1 SD 1.20 3.76 5.11
% CV 10.80 8.90 6.00
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed range for this assay is 2 - 250 uIU/ml.
A pool of human blood was purchased and hematocrit was adjusted to 55%.
An aliquot of this sample was assayed using Monobind’s liquid phase TSH
Elisa test (k971980) to give the baseline of TSH present in the sample. This
original sample was spiked with TSH (standardized against WHO 2nd IRP
80/558) to 300 uIU/mL and then used to dilute the spiked sample to various
concentrations across the measuring range before spotting on filter paper.
Four replicates of each concentration were measured.
Linear regression statistics:
y = 1.0139x – 0.4243
r2 = 0.996
Target value Observed value % Recovery

12.5 12.15 97.2
6.25 6.42 102.7
2.0 1.91 95.5
The recovery at each dilution was within 10% of the expected value.
Hook effect:
Two different sera were taken and spiked to different levels with TSH stock
solution made from the WHO 2nd IRP 89/558. Results showed no hook effect
for the Monobind AccuBind Neo-TSH Assay when concentrations up to
10,000 uIU/ml TSH were tested.

Controls and calibrators: For the calibrators and controls, a master dose
response curve is generated using master calibrators referenced to the WHO
2ndIRP 80/558 standard for TSH.
Controls and calibrators are created by adding purified, lyophilized TSH to a
pooled whole blood sample with low TSH value (and preservatives) to the
various desired TSH levels. These samples are spotted on Whatman 903 filter
paper. Values for each control and calibrator are assigned by using the master
curve described above.
Stability: Study protocols, preliminary data and acceptance criteria for
stability testing were provided for the Monobind AccuBind Neo-TSH Elisa
Assay at room (20-25°C), refrigerated (2-8°C) and elevated (37°C)
temperatures and found to be acceptable. Based on the accelerated stability
data, twelve month stability at 2-8°C is claimed for the Assay kit. Real-time
studies will continue to confirm and extend the dating.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of the Blank (LoB) was determined after 16 tests of the ‘0’ level
NeoTSH Calibrator. CLSI guideline EP17 was not followed to evaluate the
LoB. The LoB (the mean + 2 standard deviations) was calculated to be 0.5
µIU/ml.
The low limit of the claimed assay measuring range (2 uIU/mL) was
determined based on the linearity study described above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity between potential interfering substances and this assay was
tested by spiking high levels of these substances into a pooled blood sample
and calculating changes in assay results with and without the substance added.
No cross reactivity was observed with hLH (1,000 mIU/ml), hFSH (1,000
mIU/ml), hCG (10,000 mIU/ml) or hPRL (1,000 ng/ml). No effect on the
performance of the assay was observed with up to 200 ug/ml of bilirubin, 36 –
55% hematocrit, or in samples enhanced with 4% additional packed red blood
cells.
Testing to evaluate whether there is end-of-run effect (due to time delay in
reagent dispensing) with the AccuBind Neo-TSH Microwell Elisa Assay
showed that there was no drift in the measurement of the control material
whether these samples were placed in the beginning, middle, or end of the
microwell plate.
Additional potential effects on TSH are noted in the package insert and
literature is provided as references to support some of this information:
1. TSH concentration, in the circulation, is dependent upon a multiplicity of
factors: hypothalamus gland function, thyroid gland function, and the
responsiveness of pituitary to TRH. Thus, thyrotropin concentration alone
5

--- Page 6 ---
is not sufficient to assess clinical status.
2. TSH values may be elevated by pharmacological intervention.
Domperiodone, amiodazon, iodide, phenobarbital, and phenytoin have
been reported to increase TSH levels1.
3. A decrease in thyrotropin values has been reported with the administration
of propranolol, methimazol, dopamine and d-thyroxine1.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
264 patient samples from 3-7 day old infants were used tested on both the
predicate device, DPC RIA kit, and the AccuBind Neo-TSH Microwell Elisa
Assay. Samples were obtained from the NJ Department of Health laboratory;
patients were referred to this laboratory for routine thyroid testing mandated
by universal screening for congenital hypothyroidism. 103 samples from 3-7
day old infants considered hypothyroid from testing on the predicate device
were also tested on the proposed device. These patient samples were referred
to the laboratory for thyroid status check.

4. Clinical cut-off:
The sponsor references the guideline for newborn screening for congenital
hypothyroidism from the American Academy of Pediatrics for interpretation of
screening results as follows:
Category TSH μIU/ml Serum
Slightly Elevated 20 – 40
Positive (Hypothyroid) > 40
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Recommended guidelines for newborn screening for congenital hypothyroidism
have been published by the American Academy of Pediatrics. For infants 2-6
days old, these recommendations categorize TSH concentrations as “normal”,
“elevated” or “only slightly elevated” relative to values of 20 and 40 uIU/mL.
According to the AAP guidelines, “any infant with a low T4 and TSH
concentration greater than 40 mU/L is considered to have primary hypothyroidism
until proved otherwise.” Furthermore, “in cases in which the screening TSH
concentration is only slightly elevated, above 20 mU/L but less than 40 mU/L,
another filter paper specimen should be obtained for a subsequent test.”
A study of 158 newborn normal specimens (0-7 days old) was completed and the
following range was observed: 0.7-25.52µIU/mL.

At 90% (n) 0.52–13.98 (46) 0.52 – 14.65 (81) 0.52-18.7 (157)
The manufacturer recommends that each laboratory determine their own in-house
range using the method with a population indigenous to the area in which the
laboratory is located.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
