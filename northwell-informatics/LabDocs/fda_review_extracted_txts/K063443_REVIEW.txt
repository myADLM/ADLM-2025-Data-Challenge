breath sampling. The mouthpiece is snapped into a receptacle at the top of the unit.
Below the mouthpiece receptacle is an indicator light which glows red or green. The
graphics display screen displays the user’s blood alcohol equivalent concentration to
three decimal places as well as text prompts and error messages. Below the display
are up, down, and “OK” buttons for menu navigation. Two AA batteries or a single
rechargeable battery are inserted into the compartment on the back of the unit. The
device is powered on by depressing the OK button for approximately 1 second until
the start window is displayed. After 2 seconds WAIT will appear on the display,
followed by READY and a short beep when the device is ready to accept a
measurement. As the user exhales into the mouthpiece, the device monitors breath
volume and blowing time. If the flow of the breath sample is sufficient, the indicator
light glows green and there is a continuous beep. When the instrument verifies that
the breath volume is also sufficient, the green light goes out and the beeping stops,
and the concentration appears in the display.

L. Test Principle:
The electrochemical fuel cell alcohol sensor in this device consists of a plastic
housing, a membrane with positive and negative electrodes, and platinum leads. As
the alcohol gas passes through the cell, it initiates a chemical reaction resulting in a
voltage change. This voltage change can then be converted to a breath alcohol
concentration which in turn is converted to a blood alcohol concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision and accuracy of this device has previously been demonstrated
through testing required by the US Department of Transportation. For
precision and accuracy, these requirements (referred to as Model
Specifications) consist of 10 trials each at Blood Alcohol Concentrations
(BAC) of 0.000, 0.020, 0.040, 0.080, 0.160, and 0.300. Blood Alcohol
Concentrations are simulated in breath by a Breath Alcohol Sample
Simulator (BASS), which provides an alcohol-in-air test sample with known
alcohol concentrations, flow rate, and air composition. The acceptance criteria
for each concentration are: standard deviation ≤ 0.0042, systematic error
(mean – target BAC) ≤ ± 0.005 BAC or 5%, whichever is greater. The 0.000
BAC trial has the additional requirement that there be no single result greater
than 0.005. The BAC 0.300 sample is for informational purposes only and
does not have any performance requirements.
The Drager Alcotest 6510 met all of the applicable NHTSA requirements for
precision and accuracy.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
This device will report concentrations from 0.00 to 0.500% BAC However,
the DOT Model Specifications require accuracy and precision testing up to a
concentration of 0.300 only; therefore, true linearity over the entire measuring
range of the device was not evaluated. This device met all of the applicable
NHTSA requirements for precision and accuracy as described above
5

--- Page 6 ---
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device is traceable to a commercially available certified alcohol reference
solution. The sponsor states that the device can be calibrated at a
concentration between 0.080 and 0.150% BAC. The acceptance criterion for
accuracy is +/- 5% or +/- 0.005% BAC, whichever is greater, throughout a
calibration period.
d. Detection limit:
The DOT Model Specifications do not specifically address the detection limit
of breath alcohol devices. However, the devices must be tested at a BAC of
zero (blank reading) to assess the possibility of false positives. Refer to
section M.1.a above.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor evaluated the possibility of cigarette smoke interference with the
device. An alcohol-free individual was asked to smoke approximately one half
of a cigarette. Within one minute after smoking, the subject took a breath
alcohol reading according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The subject then
smoked another inhalation and repeated the test to produce a total of five
trials. The study included two participants, two brands of cigarettes, and a
total of 20 measurements. The device had no positive results. Other potential
interferents were not evaluated with this device.
Temperature:
When evaluated by the NHTSA / DOT, the device was tested at a
concentration of 0.080% BAC at a temperature of 10, 20, 30, and 35 degrees
Celsius. The mean % BAC from the four temperature trials ranged from
0.078 to 0.080% BAC and the standard deviations ranged from 0.0007 to
0.0021. However, there are no performance requirements for testing at
different temperatures. This information is reported for the information of the
potential user only.
Vibration:
Evidential devices are also subject to vibration testing to assess any possible
vibrational effects at a concentration of 0.080% BAC from 10 to 30 hertz and
from 30 to 60 hertz. This trial is repeated 10 times and the mean, standard
deviation, and standard error are calculated. The acceptance criteria are:
standard deviation 0.0042 or less and standard error +/- 0.005% BAC or 5%,
whichever is greater. The device satisfied the performance requirements for
vibration testing.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor performed a consumer study to determine if consumers could
correctly use and interpret the device using only the supplied User's Manual,
and to compare the results to a professional device (the Intoxilyzer S-D5).
There were 45 paired comparisons, and the volunteers ranged in age from 21
to 76 years of age. Each participant took their breath alcohol reading with the
Drager Alcotest 6510 and recorded the result. Immediately afterward, the
participants were administered a breath alcohol test using an Intoxilyzer S-D5
operated by a trained individual. The breath alcohol concentrations ranged
from BAC of 0.000 % to 0.097 % (by the Intoxilyzer S-D5). Linear regression
analysis of the data showed a slope of 0.9905, a y-intercept of 0 and a
correlation coefficient of 0.9995. After the study, participants were asked
questions about ease of use and interpretation. The results are presented
below:

Below the display are up, down, and “OK” buttons for menu navigation. Two
AA batteries or a single rechargeable battery are inserted into the compartment on
the back of the unit. The device is powered on by depressing the OK button for
approximately 1 second until the start window is displayed. After 2 seconds

2. Software:
FDA has reviewed the applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes __X__ or No ____
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no mechanism to identify the specimen.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The user provides a breath sample by exhaling into the device. The instrument
checks for adequate breath flow and volume during sampling.
5. Calibration:
The device is calibrated at the factory and sent directly to the end user. The
sponsor recommends a recalibration interval of six months (typical) to twelve
months (required) based on calibration stability data collected internally. The unit
must be sent back to the factory for calibration.
6. Quality Control:
There are no external quality controls available for the consumer version of this
device.
