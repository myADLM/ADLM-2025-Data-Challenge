The BD Phoenix ™ Automated Microbiology System is intended for the rapid
identification and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing of isolates from pure
culture of most aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative and gram-
positive bacteria.

Acinetobacter species, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella
species, Shigella species.
3. Special condition for use statement
Prescription Use Only
BDXpert rules software will automatically suppress the final susceptibility
interpretative criteria of Shigella species against minocycline.
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
This submission is for the AST panel only. The ID system was not reviewed.
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for the AST
Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and
equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™
Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST broth, which contains an AST
indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST broth is a cation-adjusted broth
containing Tween 80. After adding the indicator solution to the AST inoculum, the color
is blue, and after inoculation and incubation, it changes to pink then colorless as
reduction in the panel well proceeds. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded
into the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System instrument where the panels are
continuously incubated at 35°C. The resulting AST has a final inoculum of 5 x 105
CFU/ml. The instrument incubates, reads and records the results of the biochemical
substrates and antimicrobial agents and interprets the reactions to give a MIC value and
category interpretation of the antimicrobial agents. Organisms growing in the presence
of a given antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator, signaling organism growth and
resistance to the antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or inhibited by a given
antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do not produce a color

change. Additional interpretation is done using software driven “EXPERT” System
using rules derived from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI).
Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an AST result available between 4-16 hours.
This is only an autoread result; there are no manual readings possible.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S16) “Methods
for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard.”
L. Test Principle:
The AST portion of the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth
based microdilution method that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-
reduction) to enhance detection of organism growth. The MIC is determined by
comparing growth in wells containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the
growth in “growth control wells” which contain no antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility
Intersite and Intrasite testing demonstrated >95% reproducibility.
The ten isolate study described in the guidance document was used
(10 organisms tested 3 times on 3 days at 3 sites).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Quality Control was performed during the testing of all isolates on
each day of testing with the following results. The table below
includes the concentrations tested around the expected range with
the frequency of the reference and the Phoenix™ results at each
concentration.

Inoculum density control: The organism suspension density of the
ID broth was equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard using the
BBL™ CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer which was verified each day of
testing. Internal data was used to demonstrate that the use of the
BBL™ CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer would produce reproducible
results. Five different instruments were used.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The broth dilution reference panel was prepared according to the
CLSI recommendation and used to compare with the Phoenix™
results. Clinical testing was performed at four sites. The testing
included both fresh clinical isolates and stock isolates along with a
challenge set with known results. A total of 2081 isolates were
tested, 109 were challenge and 1972 were Clinical isolates. The
clinical isolates were comprised of 42.0% fresh, 34.5% recent
isolates and 23.5% stock isolates with the following performance
(see table below).
There were 2173 isolates evaluated of which 2081 were appropriate
for the panel. The performance data are displayed in the table below.

Essential agreement (EA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panels agree with the
reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the
reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panel
result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation.
Evaluable (Eval) are results that are within the test range and on scale.
The performance for Minocycline tested against challenge isolates
produced an EA of 97.2%, the Evaluable EA was 98.6% and a CA of
83.9%. There were 14 min generated by the Challenge set, all within
EA. There were no vmj and 1 maj. The EA and the Eval. EA for the
challenge set were both good. The overall performance was an EA
94.2% and a CA of 92%. Therefore the data are acceptable.
The test device had a growth rate of >95%.
