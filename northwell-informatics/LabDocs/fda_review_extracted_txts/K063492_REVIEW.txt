2. Indication(s) for use:
This submission is for the addition of the VITEK® 2 Gram Positive
Erythromycin for Streptococcus pneumoniae at a concentration of 0.06, 0.125,
and 0.25 µg/mL and a calling range of range of ≤0.25, and ≥ 1 μg/mL.
3. Special condition for use statement(s):
Prescription use only
VITEK®2 does not report intermediate results for Streptococcus
pneumoniae/Erythromycin. At this time, intermediate strains for
Streptococcus pneumoniae/Erythromycin are very rare.
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Not applicable
I. Device Description:
The VITEK® 2 AST card containing the test is inoculated with a standardized
organism suspension. The card is incubated within the instrument and optically
monitored throughout the incubation cycle. Results are automatically calculated once a
predetermined growth threshold is reached and a report is generated that contains the
final result.

Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S16) “Methods for
Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
Optics systems use visible light to directly measure organism growth. These
transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant
growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure
organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through the well. An
interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a “rapid” read but may be extended
to 18 hours in some instances. The VITEK®2 Susceptibility Card test is based on the
microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration technique with concentrations
equivalent to standard method concentrations. Several parameters based on the growth
characteristics observed are used to provide appropriate input for the MIC calculations.
Discriminate analysis is used to develop the algorithm that determines the susceptibility
result for all antimicrobials on the VITEK®2 system. The MIC result must be linked to
organism identification in order to determine a category interpretation. A category
interpretation (SIR) will be reported along with a MIC.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Ten strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae were tested at three sites.
This testing was performed using both the manual dilution of the
inoculum and also the automatic dilution method. Acceptable
reproducibility was demonstrated with only category agreement (S,
R) since that is all that is detected.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
The recommended QC isolate was tested on every test occasion
with the reference method and the VITEK®2. The reference method QC
results were in range for every day tested. The VITEK®2 was tested a
sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the system can produce QC
results in the recommended range.
Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the
auto-dilution and the manual method of diluting the organisms. Results
demonstrated that methods were comparable with the same mode.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A clinical study was conducted at three sites using the VITEK®2 gram
positive cards with erythromycin and the broth microdilution method using
Mueller Hinton (MH) broth with lysed horse blood prepared as recommended
by CLSI. Inoculum was prepared with direct colony suspension. The testing
included both fresh clinical isolates and stock isolates along with a challenge set
with known results. Two methods of inoculation (manual and automated) were
evaluated. Clinical testing was performed using the automated method of
inoculation and the challenge set was tested using both the manual and the
automated method. The test device had a growth rate of >90%. All isolates
grew in the VITEK®2 cards in less than 16 hours. Essential agreement was not
calculated because the VITEK®2 card contained <5 dilutions of erythromycin.
A comparison was provided to the reference method with the following
agreement.
