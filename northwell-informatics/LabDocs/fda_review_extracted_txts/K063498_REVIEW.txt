H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The HYDRAGEL 18 A1AT ISOFOCUSING kit is designed for the qualitative detection
and identification of the different phenotypes of Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT).
Phenotyping results in conjunction with clinical findings and other laboratory assays aid
in the diagnosis of Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The analysis is performed on human
sera separated into electrophoretic patterns ready for qualitative analysis. The procedure
includes isoelectrofocusing on agarose gel, performed on the semi-automatic
HYDRASYS system, followed by immunofixation with anti-Alpha-1 antitrypsin
antiserum. The use of enzyme labeled anti-Alpha-1 antitrypsin antiserum enhanced the
detection and identification of the different phenotypes. For in vitro diagnostic use only.
The A1AT Controls are designed for the migration control of the human Alpha-1
antitrypsin isoforms pattern obtained with HYDRAGEL 18 A1AT ISOFOCUSING*
isoelectric-focusing procedure. The A1AT Controls should be used as human sera. For
in vitro diagnostic use only.

L. Test Principle:
A1AT is a polymorphic glycoprotein found in normal human serum. It belongs to a group of
proteins which inhibit a variety of human proteases including trypsin, cathepsin G, neutrophil
elastase, etc. A1AT is mainly produced in hepatic cells and by immune system. The gene
that encodes A1AT is located at a single locus on chromosome 14 and has three alleles
designated by letters with M for normal, Z and S for deficiency, and null. Individuals with
ZZ, SZ, MZ or null phenotypes show increased risks of disease which may vary in patients
exhibiting the same phenotype. A1AT deficiency is a genetic disorder first described in
patients with pulmonary emphysema.

The assay is carried out in two stages: isoelectrofocusing on agarose gel to fractionate the
proteins in the serum samples and immunofixation with enzyme (peroxidase)-labelled anti-
AlAT antiserum to detect the different phenotypes of AlAT. The semi-automated
HYDRASYS system performs all the steps needed to obtain gels ready for interpretation.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The within-run gel reproducibility was determined by testing eight samples fifteen or
eighteen times each on a single gel of 15 or 18 tracks. Two gels of the same lot
number were used in this study. Two normal serum samples with M1 and M1M2
phenotypes and six pathological serum samples with MS, SS, MZ, ZZ, MX
phenotypes reproduced the corresponding phenotype correctly.
The between-run gel reproducibility was determined by testing fifteen samples and
three controls twelve times on two lots of gels. Seven normal serum samples (2
M1M2, 4 MM, 1M1M3); eight pathological samples (2 MS, 1 SS, 1 MZ, 1 ZZ, 1 SZ,
1 MX, 1 MI [I allele is rare and associated with decreased A1AT levels]); and three
controls (1 normal MM and 2 pathological MZ and SZ) reproduced the corresponding
phenotype correctly.
The within-run and between-run antiserum reproducibility studies were determined
by testing fifteen samples and three controls on four different lots of antiserum. The
18 samples were applied in 18 tracks of 4 gels. Nine normal samples with MM
phenotype; six pathological samples with 2 SS, 2 M2Z, 1 MP, 1 M undetermined
variant; and three controls with 1 normal MM and 2 pathological MZ and SZ
reproduced the corresponding phenotype correctly.
The within-run and between-run control reproducibility studies were determined by
testing each of the three controls (MM, MZ, SZ phenotypes) six times in four gels for
two days. All three controls reproduced the corresponding phenotype correctly.

Expected values: Qualitative Interpretation of normal pattern for A1AT ‘MM’
phenotype fraction.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit was determined by testing diluted A1AT (concentration of 27
mg/dL with pathological ZZ phenotype) down to 5 mg/dL. The ZZ phenotype was
detectable at 5 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference study: Two studies were performed. For each interfering substance, four
concentrations were tested. Study 1 consisted of aliquots from one normal serum
pool sample (normal MM phenotype) and three controls (1 normal MM and 2
pathological MZ and SZ). One set of these aliquots was spiked with hemoglobin up
to 0.35 g/dL and another set with bilirubin up to 0.20 mg/mL. Study 2 consisted of
aliquots from six normal MM serum and three controls (1 normal MM and 2
pathological MZ and SZ). One set of these aliquots were spiked with total cholesterol
up to 6.9 mmol/L and another with triglycerides up to 8.0 mmol/L. No interference
was observed.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
i. Study design: A total of 68 serum samples were tested on HYDRAGEL 18
A1AT ISOFOCUSING kit using HYDRASIS apparatus and on polyacrylamide
gels using a standard isoelectric focusing apparatus. Forty-one (41) were
pathological serum samples, 4 unclear diagnoses, and 23 were normal serum
samples. There was 100% agreement between the two methods. Results of the
phenotype interpretation are summarized below:

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and specificity:
The clinical sensitivity and specificity studies were evaluated on 68 clinically
characterized sera from patients with the following diagnosis: 16 congenital
deficiency, 15 pulmonary disorders, 8 hepatic disorders, 1 infertility and 1
panniculitis, 23 normals and 4 indeterminate diagnoses. Sensitivity was 100% and
specificity was 92%. The overall agreement was 97%.

*Equivocals were excluded from the calculation. The four equivocal samples were from patients
with normal A1AT quantitative measurements being ruled out for infertility, pulmonary and
hepatic disorder and congenital deficiency. The A1AT phenotypes were IM or FM, IM, IM, and
heterogeneous pattern respectively.
**The two false positive samples were from asymptomatic patients, one with a diagnosis of
infertility and the other, panniculitis and the A1AT phenotypes were MZ and MS respectively.
These two patients (without underlying pulmonary or hepatic disorders) are assumed to be carriers
of S and Z deficiency alleles.

Specificity: 92 % (23/25)
Overall percent Agreement: 97% (62/64)
b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. is not applicable):

4. Clinical cut-off:
Same as Expected values.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Expected values in the normal population should be the presence of MM phenotype
fraction. The sponsor has also provided literature on the A1AT concentrations for the
different A1AT phenotypes (see table below).
