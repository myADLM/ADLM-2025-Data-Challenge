controls are calibrated by reference to protein standard preparations and are
lot-dependent.
Stability
The calibrators and the controls are tested per the same stability protocol.
Products are stored at +2 to +8oC and the stability studies are conducted for 24
months using 3 vials and 3 replicates per vial. Testing cycles are 0, 12, 18 and
24 months. Additional stress testing is done at 6 months after storing at +37 oC
for two weeks. Once the products reach 50% shelf life stability,
opened/punctured vial testing is performed on days 0, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 14.
