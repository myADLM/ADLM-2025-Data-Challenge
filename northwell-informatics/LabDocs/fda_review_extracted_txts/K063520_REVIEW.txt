L. Test Principle:
The Roche Total MPA assay is a two-reagent system that utilizes a fixed amount
of mutant IMPDH II (in reagent I). IMPDH II combines with a fixed amount of
IMP and NAD to form NADH which is measured at 340 nm. The formation of
NADH is inhibited when MPA is present in the serum or plasma samples. MPA
concentration is inversely proportional to the rate of NADH formation. The
reagents used to measure MPA concentration in serum or plasma are designed to
mimic the in vivo mechanism of the enzyme.
In vivo mechanism
IMP If MPA is present
IMPDH II + NAD NADH + XMP
NADH is released from the
enzyme but XMP is not
Roche Total MPA assay mimicking in vivo
IMP If MPA is present, the formation of
IMPDH II + NAD NADH
NADH is inhibited.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

• clinical plasma pools from cardiac transplant patients taking
MPA and spiked with additional MPA.
The samples were spiked with MPA to >20% higher than the upper limit
of the assay range (15 ug/mL) and combined with a 0 or low clinical
plasma pool in varying portions to create systematic dilutions from low
levels to >15 ug/mL.
Low-end linearity (0 to approximately 5 ug/mL) was assessed for the
following:
• non clinical plasma pools (donors not on MPA therapy),
• clinical plasma pools from renal transplant patients taking
MPA and spiked with additional MPA
• clinical plasma pools from cardiac transplant patients taking

Total MPA calibrator kit (level A). Samples were measured in triplicate
on both methods and the median results were compared. The 1:5 diluted
samples had a recovery range of 97 to 105% and the 1:1 diluted samples
has a recovery range of 92 to 108%. The results demonstrate acceptable
recovery for dilution of samples with concentrations between 15 and 50
ug/mL with the diluent provided.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
The Total MPA assay calibrators and controls are prepared gravimetrically
to target levels and are verified against a validated HPLC method. The
MPA used in the reagent, calibrators, and controls are traceable to an
internally prepared mycophenolic acid. No USP material is available for
MPA.
The Roche Total MPA Reagent was evaluated for closed shelf-life
(accelerated and real-time) and open on-board stability for the MPO
reagent. The results support a 15 month shelf life claim at 4 to 8° C for
the MPO reagent. Real time stability studies are ongoing. The open on-
board stability claim is 84 days.
Real time stability studies are ongoing for the Total MPA Controls (3
levels- 0.80, 3.5 and 12 μg/mL) Calibrators (2 levels- 5.0 and 15.0 μg/mL)
and have been tested to date for 22 months. The accelerated study results
support an 18 month closed stability claim. Open bottle stability support
the open bottle package insert claims for calibrators and controls stability
(6 months when stored at 2- 8 ˚C).
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor conducted a lower detection limit study with zero calibrator.
The zero calibrator was assayed 21 times and the mean and SD of the 21
measured absorbance values was calculated. The mean mAbs value- 2SD
of the replicates was calculated as 0. 3 μg/mL.
The sponsor conducted a functional sensitivity study to determine the
concentration at which acceptable assay precision is observed. The
testing was performed using 8 samples from patients on MPA therapy
with concentrations between 0.3 and 1.06 ug/mL. Samples were
assayed in triplicate in one run per day for 10 days (n=30). Samples at
0.4 ug/mL showed 20% CV. The sponsor designated 0.4 g/mL as the
low end of the assay’s measuring range.
e. Analytical specificity:
9

--- Page 10 ---
The sponsor conducted specificity studies for the major MPA metabolites,
mycophenolic acid glucuronide (MPAG), and the acyl glucuronide of
MPA (AcMPAG). The metabolites were added to normal human plasma
containing two concentrations of MPA (1.7 and 8.3 ug/mL). Samples and
controls were run in triplicate. Samples containing a metabolite were run
on the HPLC simultaneously in order to measure and subtract out the
amount of MPA hydrolyzed from the metabolites. The percent cross
reactivity equation is:
[Control Recovery- (sample recovery-HPLC)]/ Metabolite concentration

Endogenous substances and co-administered drugs were tested in an
interference study. Eight endogenous substances were tested to the
highest concentration expected and one hundred and three co-administered
drugs were tested to a 3-fold level higher than the highest concentration
reported following therapeutic dosage. Samples were measured in
triplicate with two levels of MPO (high and low) and the median was used
to determine the deviation from the control sample. The following charts

Additionally, the sponsor evaluated the effects of 103 potential drug
interferences on the MPA assay on two levels of MPA (approximately 1.5
and 9.0 μg/mL). The samples were measured in triplicate and the median
was used to determine the deviation from the control sample. The
possible drug interferents were tested at 3X the normal plasma
concentrations and there were no significant interferences were caused by
the drugs (except for intralipid interference) listed in the package insert.
The sponsor conducted additional studies to establish time, temperature
and freeze/thaw cycles for the MPA samples used with the Total MPA
Assay. Samples were aliquotted and stored at 15-25° C, 2-8° C and -20°
C. Frozen samples were thawed on the day tested. Samples were
measured in triplicate in several time intervals over the course of at least
four weeks. The sponsor states that results for plasma sample are stable
for 3 months at -20° C and 2-8° C, and for 4 weeks at 25° C. The
sponsor’s serum results support stability for 4 weeks at -20° C, 2-8° C and
25° C and 5 freeze thaw cycles for serum samples.

The first part of the study tested EDTA plasma specimens from renal and
cardiac (148 and 117 samples from 209 patients respectively) transplant
recipients (n=265) at site 1 whose immunosuppresent drug regime
includes mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolate sodium (MPA).
Samples were assayed fresh at the immunochemistry labs then stored
frozen at -20 ˚C. The residual plasma samples were tested in parallel on
the HPLC and Integra 400 Plus.
The second part of the study tested banked residual renal EDTA plasma
samples (147 samples from 86 patients) from a Roche Pharmaucutical
MPA study that was performed at approx. 70 sites in Europe and included
renal samples from patients in France (that were stored in Germany). All
samples were from patients whose immunosuppressant drug regimen
includes mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolate sodium (MPA). The
parallel testing was performed on HPLC and Integra 800 at site 2.
The third part of the study tested 159 residual EDTA plasma specimens
from renal (89) and cardiac (70) transplant recipients from Site 1 whose
immunosuppressant drug regimen included mycophenolate mofetil or
mycophenolate sodium (MPA). The samples obtained from Site 1 were
tested on the Integra 700 and were different from the samples that were
tested at site 1. All patients had received either renal or cardiac allografts
and were on bid (twice daily) MPA therapy.
The sponsor calculated regression slopes, intercepts, and correlation
coefficients according to Passing/Bablok methods. The method
comparison results for all three sites are shown in the chart below.

The sponsor also conducted imprecision testing at the external sites, as
discussed in the precision section above.
b. Matrix comparison:
A serum/plasma comparison study was conducted for all sample types that
the sponsor recommends for use with the MPA total assay. The
serum/EDTA plasma paired samples from 50 donors were spiked and
tested in triplicate with the MPA assay on the Integra 700. The samples
were compared in the following combinations:
Serum vs. EDTA,
K EDTA vs. K EDTA,
3 2
K EDTA vs. K EDTA (half filled tubes) and
3 2
K EDTA vs. K EDTA (half filled tubes)
3 3
Each sample was measured in triplicate. The median was calculated and
serum and plasma results were compared by a method comparison. The
slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient (Passing/Bablok) were
determined. The results for each comparison are shown in the chart below.

“The therapeutic range of mycophenolic acid is not fully established and is
dependent on transplant type and coadministered drugs. Optimal
mycophenolic acid assay values to prevent rejection may vary based on the
test system and therefore should be established for each test system”.
“Decreased incidences of rejection in the early months post-transplantation
have been reported in renal transplant patients with predose MPA
concentrations (measured by HPLC) of ≥ 1.3 μg/mL with coadministration of
cyclosporine and ≥1.9 μg/mL with coadministration of tacrolimus.1,2 An upper
therapeutic range based on development of toxicity has not been established.
The clinical ramifications of MPA concentrations beyond the early post
transplantation period are not yet known.1
Cardiac transplant patients, predose MPA concentrations (measured by
HPLC) of 1.2 – 3.5 μg/mL have been recommended to minimize incidences
of rejection. 1,3 Higher predose concentrations (≥2.5 μg/mL) in the early post-
transplantion period (<6 months) have also been suggested.3,4,5 Pediatric
cardiac transplant patients have been shown to require higher doses of MPA in
