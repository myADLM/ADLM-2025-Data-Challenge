The first configuration contains 12 drugs and is intended for over-the-counter use
(OTC): AMP, BAR, BZD, COC, MET, MOR, MTD, PCP, PPX, TCA, THC and
XTC.
The second configuration contains 14 drugs AMP, BAR, BUP/NBUP, BZD, COC,
MET, MOR, MTD, OXY, PCP, PPX, TCA, THC and XTC and is intended for
professional use only.

3. Comparison with predicate:
The device is similar or the same as the previously cleared predicate(s) in the
following ways: test principles, indication for use, used in a professional and
point-of-care setting, read time and sample matrix. The candidate device and
the predicates are both visually-read single use devices.
The differences are the addition of oxycodone and changes to the cutoffs for
AMP, MET and COC are the cutoffs. The amphetamine cutoff has been
lowered from 1000 ng/ml to 300, cocaine was lowered from 300 ng/ml to 150
ng/ml, and methamphetamine has been lowered from 500 to 300 ng/ml.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The device employs lateral flow immunochromatographic technology and is based on
the principle of competitive binding. Drugs, if present in concentrations below the
cutoff level, will not saturate the binding sites of the antibody coated particles on the
drug specific test strips. The goat-anti-rabbit IgG antibody-coated particles will then
be captured by immobilized drug-specific conjugate. If the level of drug in the urine
specimen is below the cutoff concentration, the T line appears as a visible burgundy
line. If the level of drug in the urine specimen is above the cutoff, no T line develops.
The control line (C line) serves as an internal quality control of certain testing steps. It
should always appear as a burgundy-colored band regardless of the presence of the
drug if enough sample volume has been added to the test and if sample has correctly
migrated up the test strip.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Analytical performance data (summarized in section M.1) is for the new test strips
only: amphetamine (300 ng/mL), cocaine (150 ng/mL), methamphetamine (300
ng/mL), and oxycodone (100 and 300 ng/mL). Clinical performance to support
OTC use of a subset of analytes is presented in Section M.2 below.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was assessed by conducting with-in day, between day and between
lot precision studies on three lots with six devices on four samples for three
days. The four samples were 0, 75%, 125% and 300 or 333% of the chosen
cutoff for each drug.

The sponsor conducted these precision studies for both formats (dip strip and
the cassette). The results of the three precision studies were the same for all
of the drugs. No significant lot-to-lot or within lot variability among any of
the devices was detected and the results are shown in the chart below.

physician offices and one reference laboratory participated in a study that was
conducted on both formats by a lab technician, medical assistant, and a
physician. Six spiked samples (n=80), equivalent to 0, 50%, 75%, 125%,

confirmed by GC/MS. The values and results are shown in the following

The sponsor conducted a bridging study along with their cutoff study for each
drug to show that the two formats (dip strip and cassette) are equivalent. The
results demonstrated equivalency of the two formats. See cutoff section below
for a summary of the data.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. The assay is intended for qualitative use.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device has internal process controls. A colored line appearing in the
control region confirms that sufficient sample volume has been applied and
that the sample has migrated correctly on the test strip. Users are informed
not to interpret the test if a colored line failed to appear in the control region.
External controls are not supplied with this device.
The sponsor conducted an accelerated degradation study to assess the shelf
life of the tests. The sponsor has a real-time shelf-life study ongoing.
d. Detection limit:
A cutoff study (summarized below) was conducted at six different
concentrations of each new test strip and format. Each concentration was
confirmed with GC/MS.

The results support the sponsor’s chosen cutoffs of 300 ng/mL for
Amphetamine and methamphetamine, 150 ng/ml for cocaine and 100 and 300
ng/mL for oxycodone.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity for the new test strips was evaluated by spiking various
concentrations of similarly structured drug compounds into a drug-free urine
negative control. When a positive result was obtained, the sample was diluted
to half of the concentration and tested again. The sponsor determined the
concentration of the drug that produced a response approximately equivalent
to the cutoff concentrations of the assays. The cross-reactivity testing results
are listed below.

The sponsor tested many common substances and biological materials (113)
for cross-reactivity with the drug of abuse tests at a concentration of 100
μg/mL in drug-free and drug positive urines. The sponsor states that there
were no deviations from the expected results. The compounds tested are
listed in the table below.

cutoff. The testing results are summarized in the table below and the results
were the same for all the drugs. The results showed that there was no
interference from urine pH ranging from 3 to 9 and that the device formats
(dip strip and cassettes) gave the same result. Both cassette and dip-strip
format were tested in duplicate.

seconds to allow for proper absorption. The sponsor has recommended 4 drops in
the package insert.
The sponsor also conducted a reading time test and the study revealed that both
devices can obtain results from 4 to 7 minutes after adding the specimen. The
sponsor has recommended reading the test after 4 minutes and before 7 minutes.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the devices perform analytically around the claimed
cutoff concentrations appears in the precision above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The Instant-View Methamphetamine, Amphetamine, Cocaine and Oxycodone
cassette kits and test strips were compared to the GC/MS reference method.
Amphetamine (n=98), cocaine (n=108), methamphetamine (n=127) and
oxycodone 100 and 300 ng/ml (n=84 and 115 respectively for each level)
were obtained from a clinical urine sample provider. The results of the
method comparison are shown in the tables below.

was evaluated in two separate studies at five sites ( 123 cassette participants
and 63 cup participants) lay-users between the ages of 10 to 80 with varying
education levels and a trained professional were used. All participants had
proper informed consent.

Study 1- Twenty-eight urine samples were prepared by spiking drug-free
pooled urine with the drugs to specific concentrations. The concentrations of
all the drugs were confirmed by GC/MS except for TCA, which was
confirmed by HPLC. Each sample was divided into nine containers and
blind-labeled (n=252). The samples were further split into two, one for the
panel test and the other for the cup. Twenty-one lay-users at three sites were
given a set of four samples (n=252) from 84 GC/MS confirmed blind-labeled
samples, four complete devices (with all 12 test strips) and one package insert.
The lay users tested 4 samples (panel or cup) and read all 48 results. The

trained professional performed all 84 tests (both panel and cup). The subjects
were asked to read the package insert and perform the test. The
concentrations tested are shown in the table below.
Study 2- Eleven urine samples were prepared by spiking drug-free pooled
urine specimens with the drugs to specific concentrations. The concentrations
of all the drugs were confirmed by GC/MS except for TCA, which was
confirmed by HPLC. Each sample was divided into sixty containers and
blind-labeled (n=660). Twenty lay users at three sites were given two sets
(panel A and panel B) of blind-labeled samples, devices and a package insert.
Panel A is comprised of AMP100, BAR, BZD300, COC300, MET1000,
MOR2000, AMP300, MET300, MOR3200, MTD, PCP and THC. Panel B is
comprised of AMP500, BZD200, COC150, MET500, OXY100, BUP, KET,
OXY300, PPX, TCA and XTC. Panel A samples included samples 1 to 6 and
panel B samples include samples 7 to 11. The lay users tested all 11 samples
and read 127 results (12 x 6=72 for panel A and 11 x 5=55 for panel B). The
concentrations and panels tested are shown in the table below.
