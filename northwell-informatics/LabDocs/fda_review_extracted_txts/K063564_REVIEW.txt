4. Panel:
83 Microbiology
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The testing of chloramphenicol is for use with MicroScan® Synergies plus™
Panels read on the WalkAway® -SI System (including upgraded WalkAway® -
40 or WalkAway® -96 to meet WalkAway® SI equivalence). MicroScan®
panels are designed for use in determining identification to the species level of
colonies, grown on solid media, of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative
anaerobic gram-positive cocci and Listeria; the panels also provide quantitative
and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility for enterococci and
staphylococci.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The testing of chloramphenicol at concentrations of 4-16 µg/mL to the gram-
positive test panel for 4.5-16 hours or 16-20 hours for a overnight reading.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
• Turbidity method of inoculum preparation only.
• For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
This submission is for the AST system only. The ID system was not reviewed.
Each panel contains two control wells: a negative control well, and a growth control
well (contains test medium without antibiotic). Antibiotics are diluted in water,
buffer, or minute concentrations of broth to selected concentrations prior to
dehydration of the panels. The panel is rehydrated and inoculated at the same time
with 0.1 ml of suspension prepared by the turbidity method (inoculum prepared in
0.4% saline with PLURONIC®, then 0.1 ml transferred to 25 ml of inoculum
Synergies plus Pos Broth with PLURONIC®) for a final inoculum concentration of
3-7 X 105 CFU/ml. Panels are incubated in a Walk-Away® System and read
periodically starting at 4.5 hours until sufficient growth to determine the MIC.
Alternately the panels may be incubated at 35o C in a non-CO for 16-18 hours and
2
read by visual observation of growth.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) M7 (M100-S16) “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
The WalkAway® SI uses a Colorimetric Optics System consisting of a color
wheel/lamp assembly and a Photosensor. There is an initial read at 2.5 hours with a
possible final read at 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 8, 12, 16, or 18 hours (overnight instrument
readings, manual readings) depending on the growth rate of the organism being
tested. The time of final read is dependent on the growth rate of the organism and
the sensitivity of the automatic reader since cell densities below 2 x 107 cells/ml are
not detected.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using ten isolates tested at 3 sites on 3
separate days in triplicate. The study included the testing on the WalkAway®
SI read at <16 hours, WalkAway® 16-18 hour readings and manual readings
at 16-20 hours incubation. Reproducibility was determined using only
category results since less than 5 dilutions will be the panel format. All
results were >95% reproducible. Observations for trending demonstrated a
trend for the < 16 hour readings to provide a more susceptible result when
there was a difference at all.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC isolate was tested a sufficient number of times with
acceptable results on all testing days with the reference method. Quality
control results demonstrated the ability of the different reading parameters
(manual and instrument) to produce acceptable results. The following table
provides the frequency of the results in each concentration with the expected
range stated.

There appears to be a trend for the < 16 hour readings to be more susceptible
than the reference method by one dilution for both the ATCC S. aureus and
the E. faecalis. The E. faecalis also appears to trend to a more susceptible
result for all MicroScan® readings when compared to the mode of the
reference method.
Inoculum density control: A turbidity meter was used for the turbidity
inoculation method.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 575 gram-positive isolates were tested of which 495 were fresh isolates.
A comparison was made to the standard reference method result performed as
described in the CLSI document M7 except for the modification described in the
submission. The reference panels were inoculated with a very small amount of
PLURONIC® in water and added to the frozen reference panels containing the
antibiotic in broth. The use of PLURONIC® water is not part of the reference
method but MicroScan® uses it in very small amounts as a wetting solution for

inoculation of the panels with the small volume of inocula used. A validation of
the use of chloramphenicol with PLURONIC® was conducted demonstrating that
there was no difference in the results with and without PLURONIC®. The
Synergies plus™ readings were obtained at times between 4.5 and 16 hours of
incubation for > 95% of the results.
Performance of the different read methods was based on category agreement only
since only 3 dilutions of chloramphenicol are tested and a category result only
will be provided. Essential Agreement (EA) can’t be determined with less than 5
dilutions of antibiotic to evaluate. An additional comparison was done with
readings on the instrument after overnight incubation and also read manually
when incubated 16- 18 hours. Performance by these alternate reading methods
was also acceptable but when differences occurred the <16 hour readings were
more susceptible.
The chart below demonstrates the performance of all three reading methods,
(Synergies plus™ readings at <16 hours, overnight on the WalkAway® and
manually read at 18 hours using the touchScan®-SR) when compared to the
reference method result of clinical and challenge isolates.
