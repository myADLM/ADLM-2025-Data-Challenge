L. Test Principle:
Optics systems use visible light to directly measure organism growth. These
transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant
growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure
organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through the well. An
interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a “rapid” read but may be extended
to 18 hours in some instances. The VITEK®2 Susceptibility Card test is based on the
microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration technique with concentrations
equivalent to standard method concentrations. Several parameters based on the growth
characteristics observed are used to provide appropriate input for the MIC calculations.
Discriminate analysis is used to develop the algorithm that determines the susceptibility
result for all antimicrobials on the VITEK®2 system. The MIC result must be linked to
organism identification in order to determine a category interpretation. A category
interpretation (SIR) will be reported along with a MIC.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Ten S. pneumoniae on-scale organisms were tested at three sites with
>95% reproducibility. These same organisms were tested at one site
three times to determine within site reproducibility of >95% also.
This testing was performed using both the manual dilution of the
inoculum and also the automatic dilution method.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
The recommended QC isolate, S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619, was
tested on every test occasion with the reference method and the
VITEK®2. The reference method QC results were in range for every day
tested. The VITEK®2 was tested a sufficient number of times to
demonstrate that the system can produce QC results in the recommended
range.
Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the
auto-dilution and the manual method of diluting the organisms. Results
demonstrated that methods were comparable with the same mode.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A clinical study was conducted at three sites using the VITEK®2 gram
positive cards with amoxicillin and the broth microdilution method using
cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton (MH) broth with lysed horse blood prepared as
recommended by CLSI. Inoculum was prepared with direct colony suspension
and incubated in ambient air at 35°C. The testing included both fresh clinical
isolates and stock isolates along with a challenge set with known results. Two
methods of inoculation (manual and automated) were evaluated. Clinical
testing was performed using the automated method of inoculation and the
challenge set was tested using both the manual and the automated method. The
test device had a growth rate of >90%. A comparison was provided to the
reference method with the following agreement.

R-resistant isolates maj-major discrepancies
Evaluable results are those that fall within the test range of the reference method and could also
be on-scale with the new device if within the plus/minus one well variability. EA is when there
is agreement between the reference method and the VITEK®2 within plus or minus one serial
two-fold dilution of antibiotic. CA is when the interpretation of the reference method agrees
exactly with the interpretation of the VITEK®2 results.
Manual Dilution:
The challenge set of organisms was also tested at one site using the manual method of
inoculation with the following performance that demonstrated that there is minimal difference
between the two inoculation methods.
