L. Test Principle:
The ST AIA-PACK Intact PTH is a two-site immunoenzymatic assay which is
performed entirely in the AIA-PACK. Intact PTH present in the test sample is bound
with polyclonal antibody immobilized on magnetic beads and enzyme-labeled
polyclonal antibody in the AIA- PACK. The magnetic beads are washed to remove
unbound enzyme-labeled polyclonal antibody and are then incubated with the
fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (4MUP). The amount of
enzyme-labeled polyclonal antibody that binds to the beads is directly proportional to
Intact PTH concentration in the test sample. A standard curve is constructed using
known levels of calibrators, and unknown sample concentrations are calculated using
this curve. The sponsor claims that calibration curve for the ST AIA-PACK Intact
PTH is stable for up to 90 days. Calibration stability is monitored by quality control
performance and is dependent on proper reagent handling and AIA System
maintenance according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor determined the within run precision using three controls each of
serum and plasma samples in a total of 20 runs. Within each run, one set of
duplicates per control was assayed. The mean of each duplicate was used to
obtain the pooled standard deviation (SD), which was then used to calculate

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies were performed on the TOSOH AIA-1800 System. The
Intact PTH Calibrators diluted to 12 equally spaced concentration levels (7.9 –
2370 pg/ml) were used for linearity analysis. Each test level was run in
triplicate on the above analyzer. The sponsor established the acceptance
criteria of measured values being within 90-110% of the assigned value.
Based on the summarized results below and the results obtained from Limit of
Detection studies (see Limit of Detection below), the sponsor has claimed the
assay reportable range of 1.2 – 2200 pg/ml.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor’s protocols indicate that each calibrator/control lot is traceable to
the manufacturer’s primary reference material. The primary reference material
was prepared by diluting commercially available synthesized Intact PTH with
Intact PTH Negative buffer solution. The value was originally assigned by
comparing measured results with those obtained with another commercially
available Intact PTH assay for patient samples.
To ensure adequate quality control, the sponsor recommends assaying two
quality controls having approximate values 50 and 800 pg/mL, once each day
on which Intact PTH assays are scheduled.
The sponsor claims that all unopened materials are stable until the expiration
date on the label when stored at the specified temperature. ST AIA-PACK
Intact PTH test cups may be stored for up to 1 day at 18-25°C. When stored
unopened and refrigerated at 2–8oC, calibrators are stable until the expiration
date on the label. After opening, the calibrators should be used within 24
hours. When stored unopened and refrigerated at 2–8oC, the AIA-PACK
Intact PTH Control Set is stable until the expiration date on the label. Control
materials should be used within 7 days of opening or reconstituting provided
that the vials are kept sealed and refrigerated at 2-8oC.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor determined the lower Limit of Detection (LOD) based on the
algorithm in EP Evaluator software program version 4.0. This was defined as
that concentration of Intact PTH, which corresponds to the rate of
fluorescence that is two standard deviations from the mean rate of
fluorescence of 5 replicate determinations of a zero calibrator.
Sensitivity = (Assigned value of non-zero calibrator) X 2 SD
(Mean rate of non-zero calibrator – mean rate of zero calibrator)
Using different lots of Intact PTH calibrator 1 with zero concentration and a
non-zero calibrator (52.0 pg/ml), the sponsor determined the value to be 0.96,
hence the claimed LOD is 1.0 pg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor evaluated the effect of the interfering substances listed below for
the recovery of PTH. Serum and plasma samples each with 3 levels of PTH
(low, medium and high) were spiked with the interferents, and then compared
with unspiked control. Based on the sponsor-defined interference limit of ±
10% from each sample containing no interferents, following interference limit
claims were set by the sponsor.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance of the ST AIA-PACK Intact PTH assay on AIA-1800 instrument
was compared with performance of the predicate device, Roche Elecsys PTH
assay using 153 patient serum samples with PTH values ranging 8 – 1537.0
pg/ml. A linear regression analysis conducted to determine the correlation
between the device and the predicate resulted in the equation, y = 1.013x -
10.457 and correlation value of 0.997.
b. Matrix comparison:

the sponsor compared 134 paired serum and plasma samples on AIA-1800
