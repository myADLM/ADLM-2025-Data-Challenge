Devices: EP5-A2

L. Test Principle:
Proteins contained in human body fluids form immune complexes in an
immunochemical reaction with specific antibodies. These complexes scatter a
beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is
proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The
result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was done in accordance with CLSI Approved
Guideline for Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Devices:
EP5-A. Specimens with concentrations close to the reportable range
were analyzed in duplicate, twice a day, for 20 days. The within-run and
total standard deviations (SD) and percent coefficient of variation
(%CV) were calculated by the analysis of variance method. The data are
summarized below

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed on the Dimension VISTA® System by
testing a calibrator with a concentration of 1.48 g/L α – antitrypsin. The
1
calibrator was serially diluted with system diluent at the following six
dilutions 1:3.8, 1:8, 1:20, 1:40, 1:90 and 1:200. Each dilution was tested
in replicates of three and a median is calculated. Data was analyzed
using linear regression analysis (x-axis: theoretical concentration and y-
axis: measured concentration). The acceptance criteria of slope between
0.9 and 1.1 and correlation coefficient ≥0.95 were met. Data showed a
regression equation y = 1.019x – 0.029, r2 of 1.00.
Additional linearity study for the Vista A1AT assay was performed by
testing a serum sample with a high concentration of A1AT. The sample
was serially diluted with system diluent down to the lower measuring
range (4.52 to 0.22 g/L). Each dilution was tested in replicates of five.
Data was analyzed using linear regression analysis (x-axis: theoretical
concentration and y-axis: measured concentration). The acceptance
criteria of slope between 0.9 and 1.1 and correlation coefficient ≥0.95
were met. Data showed a regression equation y = 1.015x – 0.043, r2 of
0.99.
Linearity was observed at 0.15 to7.978g/L. Reportable range for the
device was set at 0.17 to 5.20 g/L
Prozone effect
The possibility of Prozone effect occurring when using the device was
evaluated with a serum sample above the assay range (10.2 g/L). The
sample was analyzed on both the BN Prospec System and the Dimension
Vista instrument, indicating no hook effect up to 11.03 g/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
The reference material is the ERM®-DA470 (CRM 470). Master
Calibrator and Master Control concentrated human serum pool were
assayed against this reference material. Commercial Calibrator and
Control Lots were prepared from human serum pool at target
concentrations and assayed against the master lot. Three reference
curves, 4 runs, 3 vials, 4 replicates per vial tested on two instruments for

a total of 144 values were used before release of shipment.
Stability studies were performed and the following conclusions were
obtained:
• On-Board Instrument Stability of opened product:
a. The Dimension VISTA™α – antitrypsin Flex® reagent
1
cartridge is stable on –board the instrument for 21 days.
b. PROT1 CAL is stable for 9 days.
c. Controls are stable for 9 days.
Study duration is 24 months. Product is stored at 2-8oC throughout
the testing cycle and tested on day 0 and after 12, 18, and 24 months.
• Sealed reagent cartridge on board instrument is stable up to 90
days.
• Open Punctured well:
a. Once the vial stopper is punctured, assigned values of
PROT1 CAL and PROT1 Con L, M and H is stable for 9
days.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity of the assay represents the lowest
concentration of analyte that can be distinguished from zero. The value
was calculated as the mean value (n=20) of System diluent plus two
standard deviations. This was found to be 0.016 g/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference: Interference testing was performed using guidance supplied
by CLSI EP7-A, “Interference testing in Clinical Chemistry”. No
significant interference was observed in:
• Hemoglobin up to 1000 mg/dL
• Bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated) up to 60 mg/dL
• Triglycerides up to 637 mg/dL
• Immunoglobulin G up to 5000 mg/dL
• Protein: Albumin up to 6000 mg/dL
• Urea up to 500 mg/dL
• Cholesterol up to 500 mg/dL
• Creatinine up tog/dL
• Uric acid up to 20 mg/dL
Non Interfering Substance section of the package insert provides a list of
drugs and other exogenous substances that do not interfere with the
assay.
