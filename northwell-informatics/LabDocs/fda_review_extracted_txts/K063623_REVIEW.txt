--- Page 2 ---
Meropenem at 0.125-1 µg/mL with the VITEK® 2 Gram Positive Susceptibility
Card is intended for use with the VITEK 2 Systems in clinical laboratories as an
in vitro test to determine the susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae to
antimicrobial agents when used as instructed in the Online Product Information.
2. Indication(s) for use:
This application is for the testing of Streptococcus pneumoniae with Meropenem
at 0.125-1 µg/mL for use with VITEK® 2 GP panel Susceptibility Plates with a
calling range of < 0.06- > 4 µg/mL
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
Each VITEK® 2 test card contains 64 microwells. A control well, that contains only
microbiological culture medium is resident on all cards, with the remaining wells
containing premeasured amounts of a specific antibiotic combined with culture
medium. A suspension of organism is made in 0.45-0.5% sterile saline from a pure
culture and standardized to a McFarland 0.5 standard using the DensiChek. The
desired card (s) are placed in the cassette along with an empty tube for the
susceptibility card. The cassette is placed into the VITEK® 2 instrument where a
susceptibility test will be automatically diluted from the ID suspension by the
VITEK® 2. The cards are then automatically vacuum filled; the tubes are cut and the
cards sealed prior to proceeding to the Incubator Loading Station. Cards are then
transferred from the cassette into the carousel for incubation (35.5o C) and optical
scanning during testing. Readings are performed every 15 minutes.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
VITEK® 2 Gram Positive Telithromycin for Streptococcus pneumoniae

“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S16) “Methods for
Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard.”
L. Test Principle:
The VITEK® 2 System evaluates each organism’s growth pattern in the presence and
absence of antimicrobials to read 20 -24 hour Streptococcus spp. plates. The
technology involves the detection of bacterial growth by monitoring the activity of
specific surface enzymes produced by the test organism. Several parameters based on
the growth characteristics observed are used to provide appropriate input for the MIC
calculations. Discriminant analysis is used to develop the algorithm that determines
the susceptibility result for all antimicrobials on VITEK®2 systems. The MIC is
determined by observing the lowest dilution of antimicrobial agent that inhibits
growth of the organism.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Performance established for the AST testing only. The Identification function of
this panel was not evaluated.

A reproducibility study was performed on 10 Streptococcus pneumoniae.
These isolates were tested once for each antimicrobial at each of the three
sites on the automated and manual inoculation methods demonstrating >95%
reproducibility for both inoculation methods.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC isolate, S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 was tested daily
with acceptable results. Quality control was also performed at all sites using
both manual and autoread methods. The test results demonstrated that the
system can produce QC results in the recommended range for both manual
and automated read methods. The Table below includes the frequency of each
result in the range tested.

reflected below. The same challenge set was tested using the manual
inoculation method. Both methods produced similar results so only one
method is presented below.

EA is when there is agreement between the reference method and the
VITEK® 2 panel within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of
antibiotic. Category agreement (CA) is when the VITEK® 2 panel result
interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation.
Evaluable is a result that is on scale for the reference method providing the
opportunity to perform an EA analysis with the test. The EA% is acceptable
when compared to the reference method as described in the FDA guidance
document, “Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”.
In this study the growth rate for Streptococcus pneumoniae was greater than
90%.
