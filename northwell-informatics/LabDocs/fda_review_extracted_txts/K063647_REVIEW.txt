CLSI EP5-A Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices;
CLSI EP6-P2 Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Analytical Methods;
CLSI EP9-A Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples;
L. Test Principle:
The Cystatin C assay uses a method based on measurement of immunoprecipitation at
540 nm. Microparticles coated with anti-human Cystatin C are added to buffered
samples. The increase in absorbance caused by immunoprecipitation is recorded after
a fixed timing. The amount of immunoprecipitate is proportional to the Cystatin C
concentration in the solution.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run, between run and total precision was conducted according to CLSI
EP5-A. Four samples (2 controls levels and 2 serum pools) were run on the
T60 in duplicate, twice a day for twenty days. The results are summarized
below.

An antigen excess study (hook effect) was conducted through a dilution study
of de-lipidated human serum enriched with human recombinant Cystatin C.
The measured signal was plotted against the concentration of Cystatin C for
each dilution. The antigen excess was defined as the concentration range
between the highest standard point and the critical concentration where the
signal becomes lower than the signal of the highest standard point. There was
no hook effect/antigen excess found up to a Cystatin C concentration of 37.4
mg/L.
The sponsor recommends dilution of samplesabove the assay range up to15
mg/L. They conducted a study to assess the linearity of the assay above 7
mg/L with human serum samples spiked with recombinant Cystatin C. Linear
regression results are summarized in the chart below.
n Range Slope Intercept
mg/L mg/L mg/L
Cystatin C 10 1.26- 15.91 1.045 -0.360
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The Cystatin C calibrator is traceable to a pure recombinant human Cystatin C
reference preparation. The Cystatin C concentration was established by a dry
mass determination.
Stability
An accelerated stability study was conducted on two lots of the reagents at 30°
C for 65 days. Real time reagent stability studies are ongoing.
Real time stability studies were conducted for the Cystatin C calibrators and
controls (low and high). Three lots of each were stored at 4-8°C and were
tested with two levels of frozen serum pools at 3 month intervals. The
Cystatin C test was calibrated with the calibrator and controls and the serum
pools were measured. The sponsors’ recovery acceptance criteria were +/-
15% or 0.1 mg/L. The results support the sponsor’s open vial and closed vial
stability of 12 months.
Value Assignment
A Cystatin C primary calibrator is prepared gravimetrically. The assay
calibrator values are assigned by multiple runs on assays calibrated using the
primary calibrator. The Cystatin C controls were value assigned from
multiple runs on assays calibrated by the Cystatin C calibrators.

d. Detection limit:
The detection limit was determined as the lowest concentration that gave a
signal higher than the signal of the blank plus 3 SD. The results support the
claimed detection limit of 0.18 mg/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were conducted with 3 serum pools with low, medium
and high Cystatin C concentrations. Varying concentrations of interferents
were added and samples were analyzed in triplicate. The sponsor defined “no
interference” as deviations less than or equal to +/- 10% of initial value or +/-
0.1 mg/L of initial value.
