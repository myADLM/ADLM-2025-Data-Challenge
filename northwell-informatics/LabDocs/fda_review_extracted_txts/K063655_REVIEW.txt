M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision Study
Specimens at various levels (Protein 1 Control L, M, H; Serum High, Serum
Pool High and Plasma High) were analyzed in duplicate, twice a day, for 20
days. The repeatability and within-lab standard deviations (SD) and percent
coefficient of variation (%CV) were calculated and a summary of the
precision data is presented in the Table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by testing a calibrator with a
high concentration of ceruloplasmin. This calibrator was serially diluted with
System Diluent (3.40 to 0.07 g/L). Each dilution was tested in replicates of
three. Data were analyzed using linear regression analysis. The acceptance
criteria of slope between 0.9 and 1.1 and correlation coefficient ≥0.95 were
met. A summary of the linearity data is presented in the table below.

High Dose Hook Effect
The possibility of hook effect occurring when using the Dimension Vista™
CER assay was evaluated with a serum sample above the assay range. The
sample was analyzed on both the BN ProSpec® System and the Dimension
Vista® System, indicating no hook effect up to 4.441 g/L. A summary of the
hook effect data are presented below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The analyte in the calibrator and controls is traceable to ERM® DA470
reference standard.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical sensitivity is defined as the minimal detectable level of analyte
which can be distinguished from zero. The value was calculated as the mean
value of twenty replicates of the System Diluent plus 2SD and was determined
to be 0.14 g/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Potentially interfering endogenous substances
Interference testing was performed to determine the effect of various
endogenous and exogenous substances on the Dimension Vista™ CER assay.
For all interferents except Triglycerides, RF, and Total Protein, the percent
bias was determined by testing a control sample without the interferent and
comparing it to the value obtained from a test sample to which the potential
interferent had been added. A bias exceeding ±10% was considered a
significant interference.
For each spiked sample, the % recovery was determined [% Recovery = (Test
result/Baseline) x 100]. The acceptance criterion of ±10% relative deviation
from the base pool was met for all interferents tested. A summary of the
results is presented below.

Cholesterol 500 mg/dL 0.43 0.42 102%
Uric Acid 20 mg/dL 0.44 0.44 100%
Triglyceride interference was evaluated by testing five samples containing a
known amount of triglycerides and compared to results from the same sample
after centrifugation. Results showed no significant change in CER recovery
after centrifugation. This study however, only showed effect of centrifugation
but did not address the triglyceride interference since the actual CER
concentration in these samples without triglycerides were not known. The
package insert was revised to state that lipemic samples should be avoided in
the specimen handling section.
To evaluate interference from total protein (TP) and rheumatoid factor (RF),
samples which had RF concentrations > 500 IU/mL and TP concentrations >
120 g/L and samples with no detectable RF concentration or low TP
concentrations were used to prepare samples for the study. A (1+1) mixture of

samples with high concentrations of RF and TP were prepared and the
ceruloplasmin concentrations determined in replicates of five on the
Dimension® Vista System. For each sample preparation, the % recovery was
calculated [% Recovery = (measured result/calculated result) x 100]. The
acceptance criterion of ±10% relative deviation from the calculated result was
met. No significant interference was found with the Dimension Vista® CER
method from the presence of RF up to 685 IU/mL or from elevated Total
Protein at 127 g/L at CER concentrations ranging from 0.19 to 0.754 g/L.
