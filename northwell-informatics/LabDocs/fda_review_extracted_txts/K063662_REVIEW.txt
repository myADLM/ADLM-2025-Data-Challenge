coated with anti- NT-proBNP antibodies bind to the NT-proBNP present in the
sample. As the sample migrates along the strip, NT-proBNP bound particles are
immobilized at the detection zone, and additional particles are immobilized at the
internal control zone.
The RAMP Clinical Reader then measures the amount of fluorescence emitted by the
complexes bound at the detection zone and at the internal control zone. Using a ratio
between the two fluorescence values, a quantitative reading is calculated.
Every test cartridge has an internal standard zone that is scanned as part of the test
protocol. This area is used to determine that sufficient sample was applied to the test
device, that unbound fluorescent label was properly washed from the detection zone,
and the device was inserted and read properly by the instrument. This control also
prevents a used cartridge from being re-run by the reader. Antibody quality, system
function and assay timing are checked on each assay run. An unacceptable result from
the control displays a warning message on the instrument indicating that the test
should be repeated.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-day precision of the upper end of the claimed assay range was
determined by testing ten replicates of each EDTA anti-coagulated whole
blood samples (some endogenous, some spiked). The ten replicates were
tested by a single operator on a single day. The mean and coefficient of
variation (%CV) are shown in the table below:
RAMP NT-proBNP: Within-day precision in EDTA whole blood
Mean (pg/mL) 2306 4051 5889 8445 19504
Std Dev 103 180 256 455 582
CV (%) 4.5 4.4 4.3 5.4 3.0
Another study examined the precision at the lower end of the assay range. NT-
proBNP Spiked EDTA anti-coagulated whole blood samples ranging from 73
to 2336 pg/mL were tested five to ten times by a single operator on a single
day. The mean and coefficient of variation (%CV) are shown in the table
below:

CV (%) 16.6 12.1 6.6 7.8 9.2 4.7 3.4 8.7
Between-day precision of the RAMP NT-proBNP assay was determined by
one operator assaying duplicates of three concentrations of control material
twice each day over a 10 day period:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed assay range is 34 - 22, 000 pg/mL. A linearity study was
conducted to compare observed versus expected values obtained with the
RAMP NT-proBNP assay using a normal donor EDTA anticoagulated whole
blood spiked with NT-proBNP to obtain values across the assay range. This
sample was serially diluted six times with the same donor blood. Samples
tested ranged from 343 – 21,921 pg/mL and recovery ranged from 101% to
120%; average percent recovery for all samples was 108%. A Passing-Bablok
regression analysis was performed, yielding the following: y = 1.06x -1.4
pg/mL, R = 1.00.
To assess the linearity of the assay around the lower end of the assay range, an
EDTA anticoagulated whole blood sample was spiked with a low level of NT-
proBNP and diluted with the same donor blood. Test samples ranged from 33
– 264 pg/mL and recovery ranged from 103% to 110%. A Passing-Bablok
regression analysis was performed, yielding the following: y = 1.06x – 2.0
pg/mL, R = 1.00.
Hook effect was evaluated using 6 samples containing NT-pro-BNP
concentrations ranging from 52- 350,000 pg/mL. The sponsor claimed that
there is no hook effect up to 350,000 pg/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The assay is traceable to a purified synthetic NT-pro-BNP material. The assay
is calibrated by inserting a lot-specific Lot Card into the reader. The procedure
and acceptance criteria used to calibrate the assay lot card was reviewed and
found acceptable.
External quality control materials are not provided but the manufacturer
cautions operators to follow federal state and local requirements to assess
quality control.
Sample stability: The sponsor presented a study that supports the claim that
whole blood specimens collected in EDTA may be stored at 2 – 8 °C for up to
2 days before testing. The manufacturer does not recommend freezing the
sample.
Reagent stability: The sponsor presented a study that supports the instruction
to use unpouched cartridges and assay tips within 60 minutes of opening.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) was calculated as the 95th percentile from forty
replicates of a blank sample run using the RAMP NT-proBNP Assay and was
determined to be 27.2 pg/mL
6

--- Page 7 ---
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was calculated using the method described in
NCCLS guideline EP17-A; the LoD for the RAMP NT-proBNP Assay is 34.5
pg/mL.
An estimate of functional sensitivity for the RAMP NT-proBNP Assay was
determined based on 10 replicate measurements of 25 clinical and in-house
donor EDTA blood samples in the range of 28 to 299 pg/mL NT-proBNP. The
functional sensitivity at 20% in blood is 57 pg/mL NT-proBNP.
e. Analytical specificity:
Potential cross-reactivity of other substances with NT-proBNP was evaluated
by spiking different concentrations of potential cross-reactants into EDTA
blood with NT-proBNP added. Different blood samples were used for each
potential cross-reactant. Less than one percent cross-reactivity (calculated as
the apparent NT-proBNP concentration divided by the concentration of the
cross-reactant and multiplied by 100) was seen for the following substances:

Potentially interfering substances were evaluated by spiking different
concentrations of potential interferents into EDTA blood with NT-proBNP
added. Interference was defined as a difference of ≥ 10% difference between
the unspiked and interferent-spiked samples. No evidence of interference was
observed for hemoglobin, triglyceride, bilirubin, cholesterol, or heparin at
levels of very high physiological concentrations of 2 g/dL, 4 g/dL, 35 mg/dL,
500 mg/dL, and 104 IU/mL, respectively.
Common prescription and over-the-counter compounds, as well as
medications often prescribed in a heart failure patient population were tested
to characterize their effect, if any, on the RAMP NT-proBNP Assay as
described in CLSI EP7-A. Maximum concentrations of potential interferents
were determined as equivalent concentrations of up to three times the
maximum recommended therapeutic dose as suggested in EP7-A or the
concentration reported in other manufacturer’s NT-proBNP assay package
inserts, whichever was higher. A second concentration, one half of the
determined maximum concentration, was also tested. Each concentration of
potential interferent was spiked into blood at two medically relevant decision
concentrations of NT-proBNP targeting 125 and 450 pg/mL. Independent
blood samples were used for each potential interferent, and all testing was
performed in duplicate. Interference was evaluated by calculating the NT-
proBNP concentration of potential interferent-spiked blood, expressed as a
percentage of the NT-proBNP concentration of unspiked (no potential
interferent) blood. The sponsor defined no interference as ≤ 10% difference
for the average of all concentrations tested. A list of the substances tested is
found in the package insert.
The sponsor provided a study that demonstrated that an additive in the sample
buffer decreases potential interference from human anti-mouse antibodies
(HAMA) and Rheumatoid Factor (RhF). In addition, a warning that
heterophilic antibodies may interfere with the assay is included in the
limitations section of the package insert.
f. Assay cut-off:
> 125 pg/mL in people < 75 years old and > 450 pg/mL ≥ 75 years old
suggests, in conjunction with other clinical information, that congestive heart
failure (CHF) is present. The assay cutoffs were established based on the
Roche Elecsys proBNP assay: the RAMP NT-proBNP assay is traceable to
the Roche method.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Six hundred and ninety-nine (699) subjects were enrolled in the method
comparison study at four clinical trial sites; subjects were drawn from
inpatients, out-patients from heart failure clinics, and patients from an
emergency room setting.
The presenting population included 46% (323) with hypertension, 30% (208)
who presented with shortness of breath, 22% (152) with diabetes, 14% (99)
with pulmonary disorders, 12% (84) with coronary disease, 8% (56) with
atrial fibrillation, 4% (31) with renal failure, 19% (133) were healthy, and the
remainder had diagnoses not believed to be cardiac related (hepatitis, HIV,
cancer, etc.).
EDTA and heparin whole blood samples were obtained for each of these
subjects. An aliquot of EDTA whole blood was used for the RAMP NT-
proBNP Assay while heparinized plasma was prepared for the Roche Elecsys
proBNP Assay. Passing-Bablock regression analysis of the 580 samples that
contained between 34 pg/mL and 22,000 pg/mL of NT-proBNP (based on the
RAMP NT-proBNP Assay results) yielded:

b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable; the assay only uses EDTA whole blood samples. The package
insert cautions the operator not to use heparinized whole blood, plasma, or
serum.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Clinical sensitivity and specificity were calculated using data collected from
858 subjects. Of these, 299 were diagnosed with CHF using local hospital
criteria, 189 individuals without CHF but with potentially confounding co-
morbidity (diabetes, renal insufficiency, hypertension or chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease) and 370 reference individuals. This reference group
includes an additional 159 subjects added from an additional clinical site
without concomitant testing in the Elecsys system. Of these, 55% (87/159)
were male and 8% (12/159) were more than 75 years old. None of these
patients had reported co-morbidities. Sensitivity and specificity by age are
shown in the following table:
