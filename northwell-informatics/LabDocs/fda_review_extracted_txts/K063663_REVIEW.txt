Contains human source material. Each donor or donor unit was tested and found to be
negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 and 2, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and
hepatitis C virus (HCV) using either test found to be in conformance with the In Vitro
Diagnostic Directive in the EU or FDA approved tests. Because no known test can offer
complete assurance of the absence of infectious agents, all human derived products
should be handled using good laboratory practice to avoid skin contact or ingestion.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Dade Behring N Latex STFR Assay
N Protein Standard SL
N/T Protein Control SL
2. Predicate K number(s):
k991157
k012470
k012468
3. Comparison with predicate:
The predicate device is for use on BN Systems. The new device is for use on
the Dimension Vista™ Systems.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI EP5-A2, EP7-A2.
L. Test Principle:
Polystyrene particles coated with monoclonal antibodies specific to human soluble
transferrin receptor are aggregated when mixed with samples containing soluble
transferrin receptor. These aggregates scatter a beam of light passed through the sample.
The intensity of the scattered light (measured at 840 nm) is proportional to the
concentration of human soluble transferrin receptor in the sample. The result is evaluated
by comparison with a standard of known concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
Evaluations were performed on the Dimension Vista™ at the manufacturer’s
site.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated using spiked serum pools, plasma pools and the
manufacturer’s control material. Specimens were analyzed in duplicate twice
a day for 20 days and precision calculations were performed according to
CLSI EP5-A2. A single calibration was performed. Results are summarized
below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Multiple evaluations of the measuring range were performed:
(1) The instrument automatically diluted the STFR calibrator with System
Diluent at the following five dilutions (bottle value) 1:1, 1:2.5, 1:5, 1:10,
1:25 and 1:50 to attain expected concentrations between 0.12 and 6.00
mg/L. The calibrator dilutions were measured in replicates of three and a
median was calculated. Results are tabulated below:
Known calibrator Observed

2.40 2.46
1.20 1.17
0.60 0.59
0.30 0.24
0.12 0.11
(2) A 1+1 mixture of serum samples with known high and low concentrations
of STFR as determined by the Dade Behring N Latex STFR assay, were
prepared and the STFR concentrations determined in replicates of five on
the Dimension® Vista™ a System. For each sample preparation, the %
recovery was calculated [% Recovery = (measured result / calculated
result) x 100]. Results are shown in the table below.

diluted with System Diluent down to near the lower measuring range (3.89
to 0.212 mg/L). Each dilution was tested in replicates of three. Results
are shown below.

(4) A sample spiked to a concentration of 36 mg/L was diluted 1:50.
Recovery was within 10%.
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
Calibrators contain soluble transferrin receptor and other analytes in human
serum.
Master Calibrator lots are traceable to a purified protein prepared and
characterized by the manufacturer. The Master calibrator lot is used to
assign the commercial lot values. Commercial lot values are validated based
on multiple runs using multiple reference (calibration) curves (total n=144).
Products are labeled with the assigned values, which can range from 0.83 to
1.70 mg/L.
Opened and closed calibrator stability studies support expiration dating.
d. Detection limit:
The claimed low end of the assay range is 0.17 mg/L. The manufacturer
defines this detection limit of the assay based on multiple measurements of the
sample diluent (Limit of Blank).
