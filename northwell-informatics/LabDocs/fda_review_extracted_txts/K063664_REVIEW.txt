I. Device Description:
The APTIMA CT Assay combines the technologies of target capture, TMA and HPA.
Specimens are collected and transferred into their respective specimen transport
tubes. The transport solution in these tubes releases the rRNA target and protects it
from degradation during storage. When the APTIMA CT Assay is performed in the
laboratory, the target rRNA molecule is isolated from the specimens by the use of a
capture oligomer in a method called target capture; magnetic micro particles are
another key feature of target capture. The capture oligomer contains a sequence
complementary to a specific region of the target molecule as well as a string of
deoxyadenosine residues. During the hybridization step, the sequence specific region
of the capture oligomer binds to a specific region of the target molecule. The capture
oligomer:target complex is then captured out of solution by decreasing the
temperature of the reaction to room temperature. This temperature reduction allows
hybridization to occur between the deoxyadenosine region on the capture oligomer
and the poly-deoxythymidine molecules that are covalently attached to the magnetic
particles. The micro particles, including the captured target molecule bound to them,
are pulled to the side of the reaction vessel using magnets and the supernatant is
aspirated. The particles are washed to remove residual specimen matrix that may
contain amplification reaction inhibitors. After the target capture steps are completed,
the specimens are ready for amplification. Target amplification assays are based on
the ability of complementary oligonucleotide primers to specifically anneal and allow
enzymatic amplification of the target nucleic acid strands. The Gen-Probe TMA
reaction replicates a specific region of the rRNA from CT via DNA intermediates. A
unique set of primers is used for the target molecule. Detection of the rRNA
2

--- Page 3 ---
amplification product sequences (amplicon) is achieved using nucleic acid
hybridization. A single-stranded chemiluminescent DNA probe, which is
complementary to a region of the target amplicon, is labeled with an acridinium ester
molecule. The labeled DNA probe combines with amplicon to form stable RNA:DNA
hybrids. The Selection Reagent differentiates hybridized from unhybridized probe,
eliminating the generation of signal from unhybridized probe. During the detection
step, light emitted from the labeled RNA:DNA hybrids is measured as photon signals
in a luminometer, and are reported as Relative Light Units (RLU).
The device is similar to the Gen-Probe Aptima Assay for Chlamydia trachomatis in
that the target organism is C. trachomatis. The primary difference between the two
assays is the platform on which the assays are performed. The TIGRIS fully
automates all steps necessary to perform the ACT Assay from sample processing
through amplification, detection, and data reduction.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Gen-Probe APTIMA Assay for Chlamydia trachomatis
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s): K053446
3. Comparison with predicate:
The reagents for the TIGRIS DTS APTIMA CT Assay are unchanged from the
initial submission (K053446). No new QC test methods were developed and/or
validated for any material or reagents since the QC test methods have been
developed and/or validated for the ACT Assay on DTS Systems. There are no
new materials that require further QC testing.
The Magellan system software is used for both the AC2 and ACT Assays, and
since the initial clearance of the AC2 Assay on the TIGRIS DTS System, there
have been no substantive changes to the hardware or system software components
of the TIGRIS DTS System. This application supports modifications to the
package insert for the TIGRIS DTS APTIMA CT Assay test system as a result of
clinically validating all specimen types on the TIGRIS DTS System for the ACT
Assay.

Analytical Performance Characteristics section for TIGRIS DTS System-specific clinical
performance characteristics.
Clinical Study Results
The performance characteristics of the APTIMA CT Assay were established in three
multi-center clinical investigations conducted in North America. In the first clinical
investigation, two studies were conducted. One, the clinical specimen study, established
the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the APTIMA CT Assay using
clinician-collected endocervical, vaginal, and male urethral swab specimens, patient-
collected vaginal swab specimens, and male and female urine specimens. The second
study evaluated the precision of the APTIMA CT Assay when performed according to
NCCLS Guidelines (16).
Clinical Specimen Study: Endocervical Swab, Male Urethral Swab, Vaginal Swab,
and Urine Specimens
Clinician-collected endocervical, vaginal and male urethral swab, patient-collected
vaginal swab, and male and female urine specimens were collected from 2,787
7

--- Page 8 ---
symptomatic and asymptomatic, male and female subjects attending OB/GYN, sexually
transmitted disease (STD), teen, and family planning clinics at eight geographically
diverse clinical sites in North America. Subjects were classified as symptomatic if
symptoms such as discharge, dysuria, and pelvic pain were reported by the subject.
Subjects were classified as asymptomatic if the subject did not report symptoms. Of the
1,392 asymptomatic subjects enrolled in the study, 2 were less than 16 years of age, 237
were between the ages of 16 and 20, 423 were between the ages of 21 and 25, and 730
were greater than 25 years of age. Of the 1,395 symptomatic subjects enrolled in the
study, 211 were between the ages of 16 and 20, 494 were between the ages of 21 and 25,
and 690 were greater than 25 years of age. Three specimens were collected from each of
the 1,322 eligible male subjects. Five specimens were collected from each of the 1,465
eligible female subjects. For male subjects, two randomized urethral swabs were
collected followed by one urine specimen. For female subjects, one urine specimen was
collected followed by one patient-collected vaginal swab, one clinician-collected vaginal
swab, and two randomized endocervical swabs. APTIMA CT Assay and APTIMA
Combo 2 Assay CT results were generated from the two vaginal swabs, one endocervical
swab, one male urethral swab, and a male and female urine aliquot. The remaining
endocervical swab, male urethral swab, and a male and female urine aliquot were tested
using another commercially-available NAAT. Endocervical and male urethral swab
specimens and male and female urine specimens tested in the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay
and the other commercially available NAAT were used as the reference NAATs to
determine infected status for each subject. Specimen testing was conducted either at the
site of subject enrollment or at an external testing site.All performance calculations were
based on the total number of APTIMA CT Assay results for endocervical, vaginal and
male urethral swab, and male and female urine specimens compared to a patient infected
status algorithm for each gender. In the algorithm, the designation of a subject as being
infected or not infected with CT was based on endocervical swab and urine specimen
results from the commercially-available APTIMA Combo 2 Assay and the other
commercially-available NAAT. Subjects were considered infected with CT if two of the
four endocervical swab and urine specimens tested positive in the APTIMA Combo 2
Assay and the other reference NAAT (one specimen testing positive in each NAAT).
Subjects were considered non-infected if less than two reference NAAT results were
positive. A total of 8,406 APTIMA CT Assay results were used to calculate sensitivity
and specificity. Sensitivity and specificity for CT by gender, specimen type and symptom
status are presented in Table 4. Table 6 shows the APTIMA CT Assay sensitivity,
specificity, and predictive values compared to patient infected status for each clinical site
and overall. Tables 7a-7d summarize the number of results from symptomatic and
asymptomatic subjects designated as infected or non-infected with CT according to the
patient infected status algorithm.Of the 2,787 subjects enrolled, there were 13 subjects
with unknown CT patient infected status. Subjects were designated with an unknown
patient infected status if results were missing that prevented conclusive determination of
infected status. These subjects' results were not included in any performance calculations.
Of the 8,452 APTIMA CT Assay results from the multi-center clinical study, there was a
small percentage (8, 0.09%) of specimens that initially tested invalid for CT. Upon repeat
testing, there were no equivocal or invalid results.

Clinical Specimen Study: PreservCyt Solution Liquid Pap
A prospective multi-center clinical study was conducted to evaluate the use of the
PreservCyt Solution (a component of the ThinPrep 2000 System) as an alternative
medium for gynecological specimens for the detection of CT by the APTIMA CT Assay.
One thousand six hundred forty-seven (1,647) symptomatic and asymptomatic female
subjects attending OB/GYN, family planning, public health, women's, and STD clinics
were evaluated in the clinical study. Of the 1,647 evaluable subjects, 1,288 were
asymptomatic subjects and 359 were symptomatic subjects. Subjects were enrolled from
sites with CT prevalence that ranged from 2.8% to 14.0%. Two specimens were collected
9

--- Page 10 ---
from each eligible subject: one PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap specimen and one
endocervical swab specimen. PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap specimens were collected
with the spatula/cyto-brush or a broom-like brush cervical sampling device. The
distribution of cervical sampling devices is summarized in Table 5 by specimen
collection site and overall. PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap specimens were processed in
accordance with the ThinPrep 2000 Processor Operator's Manual and APTIMA
Specimen Transfer Kit Package Insert. After processing the PreservCyt Solution liquid
Pap specimen with the ThinPrep 2000 Processor, the specimen was transferred into the
APTIMA Specimen Transfer Kit for testing with the APTIMA CT Assay. Sensitivity and
specificity of the APTIMA CT Assay in PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap specimens were
calculated by comparing results to a patient infected status algorithm. The algorithm
included APTIMA Combo 2 Assay and APTIMA CT Assay results in endocervical swab
specimens. Both reference NAATs were required to be positive to establish an infected
patient status. At least one reference NAAT was required to be negative to establish a
non-infected patient status. Table 7e summarizes the frequency of test outcomes for the
two reference NAATs.
Table 5a shows the sensitivities and specificities of the APTIMA CT Assay by symptom
status and overall. Overall sensitivity was 95.6% (86/90). In symptomatic and
asymptomatic subjects, sensitivities were 96.7% (29/30) and 95.0% (57/60), respectively.
Overall specificity was 98.8% (1539/1557). In symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects,
specificities were 98.8% (325/329) and 98.9% (1214/1228), respectively. Table 6a shows
the sensitivities and specificities of the APTIMA CT Assay by specimen collection site
and overall. Sensitivities ranged from 92.9% to 100%. Specificities ranged from 96.5% to
100%.

Precision Study
APTIMA CT Assay precision (i.e., reproducibility) was evaluated at two external clinical
sites and at Gen-Probe. APTIMA CT Assay precision was evaluated across three
APTIMA CT Assay kit lots, three study sites, six operators and 108 APTIMA CT Assay
runs. Two operators at each of the three testing sites performed a total of six APTIMA
CT Assay runs per kit lot for a total of 36 runs per kit lot. Each run was composed of a
12-member precision panel containing 0 to 2,000 fg/assay of CT rRNA. Reproducibility
was established using spiked swab transport medium with rRNA. Reproducibility when
testing swab and urine specimens containing target organism has not been determined.
Table 8 presents the precision RLU data in terms of Mean, Standard Deviation,
Coefficient of Variation (CV), and percent agreement with expected results for
calculations of inter-site, inter-lot, inter-operator, inter-run, and intra-run variability.

PreservCyt specimen intra-laboratory precision with the ACT Assay was determined by
spiking PreservCyt vials with 20 CT IFU per vial (0.1 IFU per reaction) and 100 CT IFU
per vial (0.5 IFU per reaction). Vials containing 1,000 CT IFU per vial (5 IFU per
reaction) and unspiked PreservCyt vials were tested as positive and negative controls.
Ten vials spiked at each IFU level and ten unspiked vials were divided between two
operators. The operators vortexed the vials and then transferred 14 aliquots (1.0 mL each)
per vial into 14 APTIMA Transfer Tubes as per the APTIMA Specimen Transfer Kit
package insert. The operators were blinded to the samples' titers. Each of the resulting
Pap-STM samples was tested once in the ACT Assay. A total of five runs were
performed over a five day period for 140 results at each IFU level. The results are
summarized in Table 9.

DTS Systems Analytical Performance Characteristics
See TIGRIS DTS System Analytical Performance Characteristics following the Figure
TIGRIS DTS System Clinical Specimen Agreement section for TIGRIS DTS System-
specific analytical performance characteristics.
Analytical Sensitivity
C. trachomatis analytical sensitivity (limit of detection) was determined by directly
comparing dilutions of CT organisms in cell culture and in the APTIMA CT assay. The
analytical sensitivity claim for the assay is one Inclusion-Forming Unit (IFU) per assay
(7.25 IFU/swab, 5 IFU/mL urine, and 9.75 IFU/mL PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap) for
all 15 CT serovars. However, dilutions of less than one IFU/assay of all serovars tested
positive.
Analytical Specificity
A total of 154 culture isolates were evaluated using the APTIMA CT Assay. These
isolates included 86 organisms that may be isolated from the urogenital tract and 68
additional organisms that represent a phylogenetic cross-section of organisms. The tested
organisms included bacteria, fungi, yeast, parasites and viruses. All organisms except C.
psittaci, C. pneumoniae, U. urealyticum and the viruses were tested at 1.0 x 106
cells/assay in KOVA-trol/Urine Transport Media and 60 organisms were tested in Swab

Interfering Substances
The following interfering substances were individually spiked into swab, PreservCyt
liquid Pap and/or urine specimens: 10% blood, contraceptive jelly, spermicide,
moisturizer, hemorrhoidal anesthetic, body oil, powder, anti-fungal cream, vaginal
lubricants, feminine spray and leukocytes (1 x 106 cells/mL). The following interfering
substances were individually spiked into urine specimens: 30% blood, urine analytes,
protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, nitrate, urobilinogen, pH 4 (acidic), pH 9 (alkaline),
leukocytes (1 x 106 cells/mL), cellular debris, vitamins, minerals, acetaminophen, aspirin
and ibuprofen. All were tested for potential assay interference in the absence and
presence of CT at the estimated rRNA equivalent of 1 cell/assay (5 fg/assay). The rRNA
equivalents were calculated based on the genome size and estimated DNA:RNA ratio/cell
of each organism. No interference was observed with any of the tested substances. No
inhibitors of amplification were observed in the APTIMA CT Assay.
Recovery
Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacteroides
ureolyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis (1 x 108 cells/assay) were added to samples
containing the rRNA equivalent of approximately one CT IFU (5 fg). These additions did
not interfere with the amplification and detection of CT rRNA using the APTIMA CT
Assay.
Swab and Urine Specimen Stability Studies
Data to support the recommended shipping and storage conditions for endocervical,
urethral and vaginal swab samples were generated with pooled negative swab samples.
Pooled samples were spiked with CT at a final concentration of 1 IFU per reaction. The
spiked samples were held at -70oC, -20oC, 4oC, and 30oC. Samples were tested in
duplicate at days 0, 20, 77, and 117. All test conditions were positive for CT at all times
and temperatures.
Data to support the recommended shipping and storage conditions for urine samples were
generated with female and male negative urine samples. The urine samples were spiked
with CT at a final concentration of 10 IFU per reaction. Two sets of the spiked urine
samples were held at 30oC for 24 hours prior to being added to the Urine Transport
Media (UTM). The two sets of UTM samples then were held at 4°C and 30°C, and tested
in triplicate at days 0, 1, 5, 20, and 35. All samples were positive for CT at all timepoints.
The two sets of UTM samples were also tested after 116 days of storage at -20oC and -
70oC. All samples were positive for CT under both storage conditions. Liquid Pap
Specimen Stability StudiesData to support the recommended shipping and storage
conditions for PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap samples were generated with negative
24

--- Page 25 ---
processed and unprocessed liquid Pap samples. For the unprocessed samples, four pools
of PreservCyt Solution samples were tested after being stored in the Cytyc PreservCyt
Solution vial. Each specimen pool was spiked with 1-10 IFU CT/assay, held at 2°C,
10°C, and 30°C, then tested at baseline and on days 5, 7, 8, 14, 18, 21, 25 and 36. All of
the spiked samples were positive for CT at all times and temperatures.For the processed
samples, four pools of PreservCyt Solution samples were used to determine processed
specimen stability at 2°C to 30°C. Each negative sample pool was spiked with 1-10 IFU
CT/assay, then tested at baseline. Prior to processing, the PreservCyt Solution samples
were stored at 30°C for seven (7) days to simulate the time lapse between sample
collection, Pap processing and shipment to a microbiology testing lab. After seven days
at 30°C, 1 mL aliquots of each pool were transferred to an APTIMA Specimen Transfer
Tube and tested at baseline before being placed at 2°C, 10°C, and 30°C. The processed
samples were then tested for 17 days stored at 30°C and 36 days stored at 2°C to 10°C.
All of the spiked samples were positive for CT at all times and temperatures.Data to
support longer storage conditions were generated from four pools of negative processed
PreservCyt Solution samples tested at below freezing temperatures. Each pool was spiked
with 1-10 IFU CT/assay, then tested at baseline. Each pool was first placed at 30°C for
14 days and then stored at -20°C or -70°C over the course of 106 days. All of the spiked
samples were positive for CT at all times and temperatures.
TIGRIS DTS System Clinical Specimen Agreement
TIGRIS DTS System Agreement
Agreement between APTIMA CT Assay results generated on the fully automated
TIGRIS DTS System and semi-automated DTS Systems was evaluated by testing
endocervical swab, male urethral swab, male and female urine, vaginal swab, and
PreservCyt liquid Pap specimens. Each of the clinical specimens was tested individually
with the APTIMA CT Assay on both the TIGRIS DTS System and DTS Systems at Gen-
Probe. The order of testing was not randomized. Specimens identified for inclusion were
tested on the TIGRIS DTS System followed by testing on DTS Systems.
Clinical Specimen Agreement Study - Endocervical Swab, Male Urethral Swab,
Female and Male Urine, Vaginal Swab, and PreservCyt liquid Pap Specimens
Female and male subjects attending STD, family planning, and OB/GYN clinics from
eight geographically diverse sites with low to high prevalence for CT contributed
endocervical swab, male urethral swab, female and male urine, vaginal swab, and
PreservCyt liquid Pap specimens. The specimens were transferred directly to Gen-Probe
for testing while the PreservCyt liquid Pap specimens were processed at 2 cytopathology
laboratories before being transferred. At Gen-Probe, endocervical swab, male urethral
swab, female and male urine specimens were first screened with APTIMA Combo 2
Assay on the TIGRIS DTS System, and the vaginal swab and PreservCyt liquid Pap
specimens were screened with APTIMA Combo 2 Assay on the DTS Systems.
Specimens with final invalid or equivocal results were not selected in the APTIMA CT
Clinical Specimen Agreement Study.Two hundred and five female swabs (87
endocervical and 118 vaginal), 120 male urethral swab, 98 female urine, 115 male urine,
and 116 PreservCyt liquid Pap specimens with APTIMA Combo 2 Assay CT positive
and negative results were selected for comparison testing between the TIGRIS DTS
System and the DTS Systems for the APTIMA CT Assay. Specimens with initial invalid
or equivocal results were retested using the same system on which the result was
25

--- Page 26 ---
generated. One female urine specimen had an initial equivocal result on the DTS
Systems; when retested, the final result was valid. One male urine specimen had an initial
invalid result on the TIGRIS DTS System; when retested, the final result was valid. One
female urine specimen had an initial equivocal result on the TIGRIS DTS System; this
specimen was retested, however, the specimen had expired, so the final result was
equivocal. Table 11 shows the positive, negative, and overall agreements for all paired
results for each specimen type by symptomatic status. Specimens are relatively
imbalanced by symptomatic and asymptomatic status but overall agreements for
symptomatic subjects were 98.5% (131/133) for female swabs (combined endocervical
and vaginal swabs), 100% (60/60) for male urethral swab, 98.2% (55/56) for female urine
specimens, 100% (60/60) for male urine specimens, and 100% (81/81) for PreservCyt
liquid Pap specimens. For asymptomatic subjects, overall agreements were 100% for 72
female swabs, 60 male urethral swabs, 42 female urine, 55 male urine specimens, and 35
PreservCyt liquid Pap specimens, respectively. For ‘All’ (symptomatic and asymptomatic
combined) subjects, overall agreement was 99.0% (203/205) for female swab (combined
endocervical and vaginal swabs), 100% (120/120) for male urethral swab, 99.0% (97/98)
for female urine, 100% (115/115) for male urine, and 100% (116/116) for PreservCyt
liquid Pap specimens. Due to the relatively smaller specimen number from asymptomatic
subjects, these findings may not be generalizable to ACT-TIGRIS System testing with
specimens from asymptomatic subjects. Refer to Tables 4 and 6 for APTIMA CT Assay
sensitivity and specificity estimates from testing on the DTS Systems. Sensitivity and
specificity of the APTIMA CT Assay when using the TIGRIS DTS System would be
expected to be similar given the agreement findings.

DTS System
Precision Study
The effect of several factors on the variability of APTIMA CT Assay performance on the
TIGRIS DTS System was evaluated using 12-member STD reproducibility panels. Panel
members contained 0 to 5,000 fg CT rRNA/assay. The panel included panel members
with CT concentrations at the analytical sensitivity claim of 5 fg CT rRNA/assay.The
panels were tested at one external testing site and at Gen-Probe using two APTIMA CT
Assay reagent lots. At Gen-Probe, two operators each performed three valid worklists per
reagent lot on each of two TIGRIS DTS System instruments. At the external testing site,
two operators each performed three valid worklists per reagent lot on one TIGRIS DTS
27

--- Page 28 ---
System instrument. One worklist consisted of run controls and six 12-member panels.
Reproducibility was determined by calculating the agreement between the final assay
results and the expected outcome for each panel member. Reproducibility was also
assessed by calculating the SD and coefficient of variation (CV) of signal with respect to
sites, operators, lots, and worklists. CVs were not calculated for CT-negative panel
members due to low signal values that could theoretically equal zero. Table 12 shows the
reproducibility results. All APTIMA CT Assay results on the TIGRIS DTS System
agreed with the expected results. CV values were less than or equal to 3.4%. These data
indicate excellent reproducibility of the APTIMA CT Assay using the TIGRIS DTS
System.

TIGRIS DTS System Analytical Performance Characteristics
Analytical Sensitivity Equivalence Study
Sensitivity panels in endocervical swab pool, vaginal specimen pool, urine specimen
pool, and PreservCyt liquid Pap specimen pool were prepared at CT rRNA equivalent of
1 IFU per assay (7.25 IFU/swab and 5 IFU/mL urine) and tested 60 replicates on the
TIGRIS DTS System. Percent positivity (95% C.I.) on the TIGRIS DTS System for
endocervical swab specimen was 100% (95.1 - 100), for vaginal swab specimen was
100% (95.1 - 100), for urine specimen was 100% (95.1 - 100), and for PreservCyt liquid
Pap specimen was 100% (95.1 - 100).
CT rRNA Spiked Clinical Panel Study
The CT rRNA spiked clinical panel study evaluated agreement between the two systems
(TIGRIS DTS System and DTS Systems) using six Gen-Probe prepared CT clinical
28

--- Page 29 ---
panels spiked with 0 to 5,000 fg rRNA/assay of CT. The CT clinical panels were created
from endocervical swab, vaginal swab, urethral swab, male urine, female urine, and
PreservCyt liquid Pap specimens that had negative APTIMA CT results on the DTS
Systems when tested at Gen-Probe. The negative specimens were pooled by specimen
type, spiked or not spiked with CT rRNA and aliquotted as replicates of each panel
member. Replicates of each of 6-panel members with different spiked rRNA levels were
combined to create one clinical panel for each specimen type. Each panel contained a
total of 132 replicates.Table 13 shows the percent agreement for each level of rRNA in
the endocervical swab, vaginal swab, urethral swab, male urine, female urine, and
PreservCyt liquid Pap panels, respectively, with expected CT results for the TIGRIS DTS
System and for the DTS Systems. The concentration ranged from 1 log below to 3 logs
above the 5 fg rRNA/assay for CT. Also shown in Table 13 are the overall percent
agreements of the clinical panel study between the TIGRIS DTS System and DTS
Systems.

Analytical Specificity Equivalence Study
For a nucleic acid amplification assay, analytical specificity with respect to individual
organisms is largely determined by the chemistry of the assay (e.g. oligonucleotide
sequences) rather than by the platform. Because the reagents for the APTIMA CT Assay
are identical between the TIGRIS DTS System and the DTS Systems, analytical
specificity experiments on the TIGRIS DTS System were designed to focus on the most
challenging culture isolates. These organisms included those known to cross-react in
other amplification assays. Twenty-four (24) culture isolates were selected from the panel
of organisms in Table 10, including 3 organisms that are most closely related to CT. All
of the organisms tested produced negative results on the TIGRIS DTS System.
Interfering Substances Equivalence Study
Whole blood, a substance commonly found in urogenital specimens and known to
interfere in some amplification assays, was used to establish that the TIGRIS DTS
System tolerates similar levels of potentially interfering substances as does the DTS
Systems. Fresh blood was added to clinical swab, vaginal swab, urine, and PreservCyt
liquid Pap specimen pools, then tested for potential assay interference in the absence and
presence of CT target at the estimated rRNA equivalent of one CT IFU/assay (5
fg/assay). The rRNA equivalents were calculated based on the genome size and estimated
DNA:RNA ratio/cell of each organism. Specimens were tested on two TIGRIS DTS
Systems. All samples containing target nucleic acid were positive when tested at a level
of 10% blood in swab specimens, vaginal swab specimens, PreservCyt liquid Pap
specimens, and 30% blood in urine specimens. All samples that did not contain target
were negative for CT. These results indicate that at the levels tested, whole blood is
unlikely to affect the CT result on the TIGRIS DTS System.
Carryover Studies
To establish that the TIGRIS DTS System minimizes the risk of false positive results
arising from carryover contamination, a study was conducted using spiked panels on
three TIGRIS DTS Systems. The study used 20% high-target samples containing 1 x 106
fg CT rRNA/mL, which were randomly spaced amongst 80% negative samples

containing swab transport media. In the study, 576 high-target samples and 2,376
negative samples were tested across the three TIGRIS DTS Systems. Table 14 shows the
overall carryover rate was averaged at 0.21% (5/2364). A total of 12 negative samples
were reported as invalid and were excluded from the calculation. A separate analysis was
conducted on a subset of the study population comprised of the negative samples that
immediately followed a high-target positive. The carryover rate for this subset of the
population was averaged at 0.47% (2/424). For false positives in this subset, the
carryover rate ranged from 0% to 1.43% across the three TIGRIS DTS Systems. These
results demonstrate that carryover contamination is minimized on the TIGRIS DTS
System.
