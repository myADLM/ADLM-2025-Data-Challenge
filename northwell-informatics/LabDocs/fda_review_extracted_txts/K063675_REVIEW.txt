L. Test Principle:
The test kit uses Chlamydiae antigen-specific murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs)
that are directly labeled with fluorescein for rapid detection of Chlamydiae which are
directed against epitopes on the lipopolysaccharide of Chlamydiae.
The cell cultures to be tested are fixed in acetone. The Chlamydiae DFA Reagent is
added to the cells to determine the presence of chlamydial antigens. After incubating
at 35ºC to 37ºC for 48 to 72 hours, the infected cells are stained with a fluorescein
conjugated MAb while uninfected cells are counterstained with an Evan’s Blue dye.
The stained cells are rinsed with the diluted PBS Concentrate, a drop of the supplied
Mounting Fluid is added and a cover slip is placed on the prepared cells. The cells
are examined using a fluorescence microscope.
Interpretation of results: It is recommended that controls be examined first to
ensure proper test performance before examination of the specimens. A result is
considered positive when bright, apple-green fluorescence is observed in the infected
cells. If fluorescent cells are found, indicating a Chlamydia-positive specimen, it
should be reported as, “Chlamydia isolated by cell culture.” Uninfected cells will
stain dull red due to the Evan’s Blue counter-stain included in this device. The entire
monolayer of cells must be examined for Chlamydiae-infected, fluorescent cells. If
no fluorescent cells are found, the results of testing of the specimen should be
reported as, “No Chlamydia detected.”

d. Analytical Sensitivity:
Analytical sensitivity was determined by inoculating two 96-well cell culture
plates with Chlamydia trachomatis diluted to one (1) TCID per well for the
50
entire plate. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 hours and then stained
with either the Subject MAbs or the Predicate, Chlamydia CC FA Kit
(Trinity). Both plates were stained using the procedure in the respective
product insert. This assay was performed 3 times with an average of 36
positive wells detected with the subject MAbs and an average of 37 positive
wells with the predicate. These results are not statistically different by a
paired t-test.
C. trachomatis was diluted to a value of ~350 TCID and serial 2-fold
50
dilutions were then made to a final value of ~0.7 TCID . Each dilution of C.
50
trachomatis was inoculated into 6 McCoy shell vials, centrifuged at 700xg for
60 minutes and incubated at 35-37oC for 48 hours. The subject MAbs or the
predicate, Chlamydia CC FA Kit (Trinity), was used to stain 3 shell vials of
each C. trachomatis dilution according to the product inserts. The sensitivity
of both fluorescent antibody stains is substantially equivalent, with ~ 0.7 – 1.4
TCID as the minimum C. trachomatis dilution detected, as indicated by at
50
least one cover slip having no detectable infection.
e. Analytical specificity:
The Chlamydiae DFA Reagent was tested for its ability to detect in cell
culture the 15 known serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis as well as the C.
psittaci and C. pneumoniae. Cell cultures (McCoy, BGMK, or HEp-2) were
inoculated with approximately 1.5 x 106 infective units of Chlamydia
trachomatis, Chlamydophila psittaci, or Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and
incubated for 2 days to yield a 3+ to 4+ infection. Cultures were processed
and stained with the Chlamydia DFA Reagent or specially prepared DFA
reagents containing only one of the Chlamydia MAbs. The MAbs were found
to react with all organisms tested, as presented in Table 2

The Chlamydiae DFA Reagent was also tested for cross-reactivity against
57 virus strains (cultured and processed for staining), 20 host culture cell
types, one yeast, one protozoa, and 28 bacterial cultures including
Staphylococcus aureus, a protein-A-producing bacterium. The DFAs
were prepared at 1.5X the concentration that is provided in the kit. Each
of the tested viruses was prepared as infected cell monolayers, 150 to 2100
TCID . Bacterial strains were cultured, processed as suspensions, then
50
spotted on microscope slides at concentrations ranging from 6.4x104 to
2.93x107 cfu per well in a 10 µL dot, then stained with the 1.5X DFAs
according to the procedure in the product insert. Cell cultures were
stained as confluent monolayers. No cross-reactivity was observed with
all tested microorganisms and cell cultures except the S. aureus, which
generated small points of fluorescence. Protein A specifically binds to the
Fc portions of conjugated antibodies. Such binding can be distinguished
from viral antigen binding on the basis of morphology, i.e., S. aureus-
bound fluorescence appears as small, ~1 micron diameter, bright dots.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
This study included nine hundred and ninety four (994) original specimens
evaluated for the presence of Chlamydiae by this product (“Subject” test) and
three currently marketed Culture Confirmation Kits (“Comparison” tests).
These evaluations were conducted at three external laboratory sites using one
Comparison Device (American Microscan DFA Chlamydia Detection Kit)
and one in-house laboratory where the two other Comparison Devices were
used: (1) A reference laboratory in the southeastern United States; (2) A
hospital laboratory in the mid-west United States; (3) A hospital laboratory in
the southwestern United States; and (4) Diagnostic Hybrids’ in-house virology
laboratory.

3. Clinical studies:
A subset of 661 prospectively collected and contiguous specimens, from study
sites 1, 2, and 3, were tested using the same predicate device as comparator.
Percent Agreement and 95% Confidence Interval between the Subject Device and
Comparison test for the three external laboratory sites was calculated and is
presented in Table 6. Results from both fresh and frozen specimens are included.
PPA = positive percent agreement, NPA = negative percent agreement.

Results from the remaining specimens were not included in these calculations and
are presented separately in section c below since (1) Sites 2 and 3 included a total
of 213 specimens which had been frozen and archived in order to show
performance of the Subject Device on a larger number of Chlamydiae-positive
specimens, and (2) Site 4 tested the Subject Device against two Comparison
Devices using 120 frozen specimens (prospectively collected, and contiguous).

Due to low prevalence of Chlamydiae in the populations of specimens,
investigators evaluated additional archived (frozen) specimens that had
originally been identified as containing Chlamydiae. The combined results of
testing of archived specimens at Sites 2 and 3 are presented in Table 7 below.
