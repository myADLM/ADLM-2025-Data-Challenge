L. Test Principle:
The Cobas lithium is a colorimetric test in which lithium present in a sample reacts
with a substituted porphyrin compound at an alkaline pH, resulting in a change in
absorbance which is directly proportional to the concentration of lithium in the
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Imprecision was evaluated for 21 days by testing two serum samples and two
controls in triplicates on the Cobas c501 analyzer on a single lot at the
manufacturer’s site. Within-run precision was evaluated by testing two serum
samples and two controls in replicates of 21 on the Cobas c501 analyzer on a
single lot. The results are shown in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor conducted two recovery studies to encompass the following
ranges- 0.01 to 1.03 mMol/l and 0.00 to 3.37 mMol/l. The dilution series (11
samples) were prepared from spiked lithium chloride serum samples and the
recovered values were compared to the theoretical values based on known
dilutions. The deviations from expected recovery for the assay ranged from
90.9 to 104.4%.
The sponsor validated the upper auto-dilution range via a recovery study using
automated dilution rerun 5 samples ranging from 3.51 to 5.66 mMol/l. The
control material was run in duplicate and the percent recovery ranged from
99% to 104%.
The combined results supports the sponsor’s claimed measuring range of 0.05
mMol/l to 3.00 mMol/l (up to 6.00 mMol/l with autodilution).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor conducted shelf-life and on-board reagent stability studies and
the results supports the sponsor’s shelf life stability claim of 12 months and an
on-board stability claim of 4 weeks.
The sponsor also conducted a shelf-life stability study on the C.f.a.s.
calibrators. The results support the calibrators 24 month stability claim.
The C.f.a.s. lithium values are traceable to SEM 956b, a serum-based lithium
standard reference material.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor conducted a limit of blank (LoB) study according CLSI EP 17-A.
Five human sera samples free of analyte were measured in duplicate in six
separate runs for a total of 60 values. The sponsor reports a LoB of 0.02
mMol/L.
The sponsor conducted as limit of detection (LoD) study according to
guidelines CLSI EP 17-A. The LoD was determined as the lowest amount of
analyte in a sample that can be detected with 95% probability. Five samples
with low lithium concentrations between 0.1 and 0.5 mMol/L were measured
in duplicate in six separate runs for a total of 60 values. The precision (SD)
was calculated for each sample. A pooled estimate of precision over the five
samples was then determined (SDtotal) and the LOD was calculated as
LoD=LoB + 1.653 x SDtotal. The sponsor reports a LoD of 0.05 mMol/L.

Precision at the lower assay range was determined by evaluating ten samples
with concentrations ranging from 0 and 0.4 mMol/L, twice a day over 5 days
on the Cobas c01 analyzer. The mean, standard deviation and the CV were
calculated for each concentration and the CVs were plotted against the mean
concentration. Based on this evaluation and the linearity evaluation, the
lowest concentration where the CV yielded 20% or less was 0.09 mMol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous interferents were tested using pooled human plasma and serum
samples spiked with varying levels of interferent. The samples were tested in
triplicates and the median values were used to calculate recovery. Five
different human serum/plasma pools containing 0.82 – 1.10 mMol/L lithium
were tested for hemoglobin, bilirubin and intralipid interference. Ten levels
of hemoglobin were tested up to 1000 mg/dL. Eleven levels of conjugated and
unconjugated bilirubin were tested up to 61.0 mg/dL. Ten levels of intralipid
were tested up to 2000 mg/dL. The sponsor defined interference as recovery
greater than +/-10% of initial values at therapeutic concentrations. There was
no interference detected up to the concentrations noted above.
Eighteen commonly used pharmaceuticals were tested for interference with
the lithium test system. Two serum pools with two lithium concentrations
(0.91 and 1.48 mMol/L) were tested. Varying concentrations of interferent
were added and samples were analyzed in triplicate. The sponsor defined
interference as recovery greater than +/-5% of initial values at therapeutic
concentrations. No interference was detected at the concentrations tested. The
following drugs were tested:
Acetylcystein Ampicillin-Na Axcorbic Ca-Dobesilate Cyclosporine Na-Cefoxitin
acid
Lithium Intralipid Levodopa Methydopa+1,5 Metronidazole Phenylbutazone
Heparin
Doxycyclin Acetylsalycilic Rifampicin Acetaminophen Ibuprofin Theophilline
(tetracycline) acid
Eight potentially interfering cations were studied for interference with the
lithium test system (0.91 and 0.94 mMol/L). The interfering compounds were
weighed in gravimetrically and no interference was observed for any of the
compounds up to the concentrations listed below.
NH4Cl (19.8 μmol/L) NaCl (140 Mol/L) KCl (4 mMol/L) 1.01 CaCl2 (2.4 mMol/L)
MgCl2 (0.9 mMol/L) FeCl3 (1.04 mg(L) Cu(NO3)2 (1.15 mMol/L) ZnCl2 (1.07 mMol/L)

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor conducted a method comparison study compared to the predicate.
Seventy eight unaltered patient samples ranging from 0.120 to 3.345 mMol/l
were run against a commercially available reagent. The results for both the
Passing/Bablok and least squares regression are shown below.

b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor conducted most of the studies for this submission on serum
samples. To validate the use of additional sample types (sodium heparin and
potassium EDTA plasma and serum separator tubes (SST)) parallel samples
were collected in serum, SST, Na-Heparin plasma and K EDTA plasma
2
tubes. Samples were collected from 20 different donors. Lithium was spiked
to all tubes resulting in a lithium concentrations ranging from 0.6 to 1.75
mMol/L. Two anticoagulant concentrations were assessed for each type of
anticoagulant with serum clot activator tube as the reference. Each sample was
split and 20 were filled completely and 20 were half-filled resulting in twice
the expected anticoagulant concentration. Plasma results were compared to the
serum results and percent recovery was determined. The percentage deviations
from expected recovery for the assay ranged from 95.5 to 102.6 for SST, 95.5
to 102.9 for filled sodium heparin, 95.0 to 104.4 for half-filled sodium
heparin, 94.3 to 105.6 for the filled K2-EDTA and 94.4 to 105.6 for half-filled
K2-EDTA. The results support the usage of SST, sodium heparin and
potassium EDTA with the device.
