510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
K063689
B. Purpose of Submission:
Addition of a new specimen type claim (nasopharyngeal swab) to the currently
marketed device K042472
C. Analyte:
Influenza A and B viral antigens
D. Type of Test:
Rapid chromatographic immunoassay that differentiates influenza A viral antigens
from influenza B viral antigens
E. Applicant:
Becton, Dickinson and Company.
F. Proprietary and Established Names:
BD DirectigenTM EZ Flu A+B Kit
G. Regulatory Information:
1. Regulation section:
21 CFR§866.3330
2. Classification:
I
3. Product Code:
GNX – Antigens, CF (including CF controls), Influenza Virus A, B, C.
4. Panel:
83 Microbiology
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The BD Directigen™ EZ Flu A+B test is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the
direct and qualitative detection of influenza A and B viral antigens from nasopharyngeal
washes/aspirates, nasopharyngeal swabs and throat swabs of symptomatic patients. The
BD Directigen EZ Flu A+B test is a differentiated test, such that influenza A viral
antigens can be distinguished from influenza B viral antigens from a single processed
sample using a single device. The test is to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza
A and B viral infections. All negative test results should be confirmed by cell culture
because negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used
as the sole basis for treatment or other management decisions.
Performance characteristics for Influenza B using nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) were
established primarily with retrospective, frozen specimens. Users may wish to
establish the sensitivity of this test for Influenza B using fresh nasopharyngeal swab

3. Clinical studies:
See: http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/reviews/K042472.pdf. In addition, the
following clinical studies were performed in support of the new specimen
types, nasopharyngeal swab specimens:
The performance characteristics of the BD Directigen EZ Flu A+B test as
compared to viral cell culture were determined using 456 prospective
nasopharyngeal swab specimens. The sensitivity and specificity of the BD
Directigen EZ A+B test for influenza A were 90.7% (146/161) and 93.2%
(275/295), respectively. For influenza B, the sensitivity and specificity
were 100.0% (1/1) and 100.0% (455/455), respectively. To augment the
study with an adequate number of positive samples for influenza B, 59
retrospective nasopharyngeal swab specimens were tested with the BD
Directigen EZ Flu A+B test and compared to viral cell culture. Note:
Performance characteristics for Influenza B using nasopharyngeal swabs
(NPS) were established primarily with retrospective, frozen specimens.
Therefore, users should establish the sensitivity of this test for Influenza B
using fresh nasopharyngeal swab specimens. The positive and negative
agreement of the BD Directigen EZ A+B test for influenza A with the
retrospective nasopharyngeal swab specimens were 85.7% (6/7) and 96.2%
(50/52). The positive and negative agreement for influenza B with the
retrospective nasopharyngeal swab specimens were 74.4% (32/43) and
100.0% (16/16), respectively. The performance characteristics as compared
to cell culture for nasopharyngeal swab specimens are presented in Tables
1, 2, 3 and Table 4:
