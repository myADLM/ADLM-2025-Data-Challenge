510(k) Submission For
Forsure One Step Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Screen Card Test
New Bay Bioresearch Co., Ltd.
Panel: Hematology (81)
Predicate Devices:
Forsure One Step Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Screen Card Test is substantially equivalent to
WHPM Hemosure One Step Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Test cleared by FDA (K041202) for its
stated intended use.
Device Description:
Forsure One Step Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Screen Card Test is a qualitative, sandwich
colloidal gold conjugate immunoassay for the determination of human hemoglobin in feces. The
method employs a unique combination of monoclonal antibodies to selectively identify
hemoglobin in test sample with a high degree of sensitivity. In less than 5 minutes, elevated
levels of human hemoglobin as low as 50 ng/ml can be detected, and positive results for high
levels of hemoglobin can be seen in the test as early as two to three minutes. As the test sample
flows through the absorbent device, the Colloidal Gold labeled antibody- conjugate binds to the
hemoglobin in the specimen forming an antibody-antigen complex. This complex binds to
another anti-hemoglobin antibody in the positive reaction zone and produces a pink-ross color
band when hemoglobin concentration is greater than 50 ng/ml. In the absence of hemoglobin,
there is no line in the positive reaction zone. The reaction mixture continues flowing through the
absorbent device past the positive reaction zone and negative control zone. Unbind conjugate
binds to the reagents in the negative control zone, producing a pink rose color band,
demonstrating that the reagents and device are functioning correctly.
A NEGATIVE specimen produces one distinct color bands in control area. A POSITIVE
specimen produces two color band in the control and test area. There is no meaning attributed to
color or its intensity for either line.
Intended Use:
Forsure One Step Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) Screen Card Test is a rapid,
immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative detection of intact hHb (human hemoglobin)
in fecal specimens. It is a convenient and hygienic method for detecting human fecal occult
blood, which may be in dicative of gastrointestinal disease associated with bleeding such as
colorectal carcinoma, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and colon polyps in humans.
Comparison to Predicate Device(s):
Both devices (Forsure and WHPM) are for the qualitative determination of the Fecal Occult
Blood. The specific antibodies against human hemoglobin were used in both devices. All test
devices are visually -read single use device. The cutoff of each analyte is same (50 ng/ml or 50
ig/g of feces).
