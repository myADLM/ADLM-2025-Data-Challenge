K. Standard/Guidance Documents Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI Documents:
• User Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices:
Approved Guideline (EP5-A2)
• Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: a Statistical
Approach: Approved Guideline (EP6-A2)

Guideline (EP9-A2)
L. Test Principle:
Electrolyte measurements in the T60 analyzer are made with ion selective electrodes
(ISE) directly without any dilution of the sample. The measurement cell consists of
several ion selective electrodes and one reference electrode. The measured potential
between each ISE and the common reference electrode is in the simplest case related
to the natural logarithm of the ionic activity according to the Nernst equation. The
changes in potential are developed across the ISE membrane/sample interface.
Selectivity coefficients toward other ions must be known in the determination of
lithium, as the lithium electrode is also sensitive to sodium. This is taken into account
in the Nikolsky equation.
The theophylline assay uses recombinant DNA technology to produce a unique
homogeneous enzyme immunoassay system. The assay is based on the bacterial
enzyme β-galactosidase, which has been genetically engineered into two inactive
fragments. These fragments spontaneously reassociate to form fully active enzyme
that, in the assay format, cleaves a substrate, generating a color change that can be
measured spectrophotometrically. In the assay, analyte in the sample competes with
analyte conjugated to one inactive fragment of β-galactosidase for antibody binding
site. If analyte is present in the sample, it binds to antibody, leaving the inactive
enzyme fragments free to form active enzyme. If analyte is not present in the sample,
antibody binds to analyte conjugated on the inactive fragment, inhibiting the
reassociation of inactive β-galactosidase fragments, and no active enzyme is formed.
The amount of active enzyme formed and resultant absorbance change are directly
proportional to the amount of drug present in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Lithium: To evaluate precision, the within-run and between-run repeatability
of the Lithium assay was calculated using CLSI EP5-A2 as a guideline. Two
commercially marketed serum controls were measured on two runs per day,
two replicates per run, over 21 days (low control sample) or 22 days (high
control) using three T60 analyzers, three electrodes and two operators.

--- Page 5 ---
Theophylline: The within-run and between-run repeatability as well as total
precision of the Theophylline assay was calculated using CLSI EP5-A2 as a
guideline. Three commercially marketed controls (sub-therapeutic,
therapeutic and toxic levels) were tested over 21 days, two runs per day, two
replicates per run, two reagent lots, by three operators, on three different
instruments.
Assay Mean Total Between run Within run
SD CV (%) SD CV (%) SD CV (%)
Li 0.95 mmol/L 0.020 2.1 0.009 0.9 0.008 0.9
Li 1.86 mmol/L 0.039 2.1 0.009 0.5 0.017 0.9
Theo 4.4 µg/ml 0.35 8.0 0.10 2.2 0.17 3.9

Theo 28.1 µg/ml 0.87 3.1 0.31 1.1 0.21 0.8
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Lithium: The claimed measuring range is 0.2 - 4.0 mmol/l. Linearity across
the range was evaluated with a dilution series using normal level human
serum spiked with lithium chloride with values spanning the measuring range.
Four parallel measurements were made in random order. The assay recovered
+/- 0.15 mmol/l or +/- 10% from expected values.
Theophylline: The claimed measuring range is 1.4 – 40 µg/ml. Linearity
across the range was evaluated with two studies. The first study used the low
and high calibrator (TDM Calibrator B0 and B1) to create a series of 11
samples that ranged from 0.283 – 44.8 µg/ml. The second dilution series used
low patient serum spiked with TDM Calibrator B1 and samples ranged from
1.0 – 49 µg/ml. Four parallel measurements were made in random order for
both dilution series. Both series showed recovery within +/- 10% from
expected values.
It is recommended in the labeling that samples with theophylline values above
40 µg/ml are diluted 1:1 with the TDM Calibrator 0 before re-testing. This
recommendation was tested by preparing 1-to-1 dilutions with TDM
Calibrator B0 as well as drug free serum and comparing recovery with the
expected value. The high samples were prepared by spiking separate low
level human serum samples with TDM Calibrator B1. The spiked serum
samples were then diluted 1- to-1 both with drug free serum and with TDM
calibrator B0. The four replicates of the diluted samples were analyzed on the
T60 analyzer. Dilution of high sample with TDM Calibrator B0 showed
efficient recovery of all samples tested.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
ISE Calibrator 1 and 2&3: The ISE Calibrators are prepared gravimetrically
using purity grade chemicals and purified laboratory water. The levels of the
calibrators are verified by comparison to the in-house reference lot, which is
traceable to the primary NIST standard SMR 924 using the reference

measurement procedure, in this case NBR 260-69. The most recent
traceability testing was performed by DGKL (Reference Institute of the
German Society of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Germany).
To test the normal production lots of a new ISE Calibrators the ion-selective
electrode-based electrolyte analyzer is calibrated with the manufacturer’s ISE
Standards. Control sera are used to verify the calibration and electrode
functionality. The ISE Calibrator lots to be checked are then measured
alongside the existing ISE Standards five times each interspersed with the
serum controls to check the consistency of the calibration.
Shelf life (2°C) and on-board stability testing protocols and the acceptance
criteria for stability testing were described and found to be acceptable.
TDM Calibrator Set B: The primary standard is prepared gravimetrically
from mixing USP Theophylline reference material into drug-free human
serum. Value assignment of new lots of primary standards (high and low) is
verified through validation studies using the previous set of primary standards.
Commercial product calibrators are made with Theophylline in an artificial
matrix. The commercial calibrators are assigned values based on the current
set of primary calibrators (1 vial x 10 determinations each, 3 runs).
Shelf life (2-8°C) and open vial (60 days at 2-8°C) stability testing protocols
and the acceptance criteria for stability testing were described and found to be
acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
Theophylline: Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined with 24 replicates of
TDM Calibrator B0 solution. The LoB was defined as the concentration
corresponding to three standard deviations above the average concentration,
and calculated to be 0.8 µg/mL. The Limit of Detection (LoD) was
determined to be 1.4 µg/mL.
The low detection limit of the Lithium ISE electrode (0.2 mmol/L) was
validated in the linearity study described above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies: An evaluation of potential assay interferences was
performed to assess the performance of the Lithium and Theophylline assays
when potential contaminants are present in a sample. Testing was done
according to CLSI EP7-A2. Non-interference was defined as deviations less
than or equal to ± 10% of the initial value.
Lithium: No interference was found with bilirubin (total) up to 40 mg/dl,
hemolysis up to 1000 mg/dl or lipemia up to 1000 mg/dl.

The following substances were screened at (or above) the CLSI document
EP7-A or Laboratory Handbook1 suggested screening concentrations in three
levels of Li+ (0.5, 1.2, 2.0 mM). The Li+ concentrations in the patient sera
(Scipac) were spiked from a 0.5 M stock LiCl solution. The following table
lists the substances tested and the screen concentrations used:
Substance Concentration
Acetaminophen 253.50 µg/mL
Acetazolamide 30.67 µg/mL
Acetylsalicylic Acid (aspirin) 612.54 µg/mL
Calcium (ionized) 14.84 mg/dL
Carbamazepine 30.01 µg/mL
Copper 984.96 µg/dL
Ibuprofen 499.63 µg/mL
Iron 563.58 µg/dL
Magnesium (ionized) 4.862 mg/dL
Methyl Paraben 160.00 mg/dL
N-Acetylprocainamide 39.94 µg/dL
Phenobarbital 102.67 µg/dL
Phenytoin (5,5-Diphenylhydantoin) 50.50 µg/dL
Potassium 10.3 mmol/L
Procainamide 24.00 µg/dL
Quinidine 12.88 µg/dL
Sodium 200 mmol/L
Theophylline 40.00 µg/dL
Valproate 496.48 µg/dL
Zinc 771.60 µg/dL
Samples containing the interferant were compared against blank samples. If
the results varied by more than 5% or by more than 0.05 mmol/L, the
substance was considered to interfere with the Li+ test. Of these 20 species,
only methyl paraben was a significant interferant towards the T60i Li+ ISE
measurement, and caused a decrease in the measured Li+ concentration.
A series of 5 concentrations was then run for the Li+ method with methyl
paraben as the interferant to determine what concentration of methyl paraben
does not interfere significantly, and it was determined that methyl paraben
levels as low as 39 mg/dL can cause a 5% decrease in the measured Li+.
Li+ Level Bias with 150 mg/dL % Bias
methyl paraben
0.5 mmol/L - 0.084 mmol/L 16.80%
1.2 mmol/L - 0.198 mmol/L 16.50%
