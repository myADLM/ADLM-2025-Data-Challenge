hCG present in the sample with a biotinylated antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-β-
hCG) and a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled antibody conjugate (mouse
monoclonal anti-β-hCG). The antigen-antibody complex is captured by steptavidin
on the wells. Unbound materials are removed by washing. The bound HRP
conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. A reagent containing luminogenic
substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt) and an electron transfer agent is
added to the wells. The HRP in the bound conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the
luminol derivative, producing light. The electron transfer agent (a substituted
acetanilide) increases the level of light produced and prolongs its emission. The light
signals are read by the VITROS Immunodiagnostic System. The amount of HRP
conjugate bound is directly proportional to the amount of hCG present.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was performed using CLSI Document EP5-A as a guideline. Two
replicates each of three re-hydrated freeze-dried control sera and two frozen
patient sample pools were assayed on 2 separate runs per day over more than
20 days. Two reagent lots and two analyzers were used.

Units = mIU/mL
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The measuring range for this assay is 2.39 – 15,000 mIU/mL.
Linearity was evaluated using CLSI Document EP6-A2 as a guideline.
Three studies were performed to evaluate the measuring range. First, two
plasma sample pools were mixed: a low pool which had an estimated hCG
titer of 52.9 mIU/mL and a high pool estimated to be 19,520 mIU/mL. In
order to evaluate the linearity at the low part of the measuring range, a low
pool at 2.18 mIU/mL and a high pool at 57.2 mIU/mL were also serially
mixed and evaluated.
For the first recovery study (52.9 – 19520 mIU/mL) that evaluated the entire
assay range using nine samples (six replicates of each), the recoveries ranged
from 94.8 - 111.6%, with a mean result of 103.6%. The second recovery
study (2.18 – 57.2 mIU/mL) that evaluated the low end of the assay range
using eleven samples (six replicates) had recoveries ranging from 92.9 -
118.8%, with a mean result of 101.2%.
Recovery of the upper end of the measuring range was evaluated by
measuring negative male serum spiked with known amounts of the WHO 4th
IS (75/589). High and low pools were made and admixtures of the two pools

were prepared generating samples ranging from 13,065 – 15,489 mIU/mL.
All samples were then measured on the VITROS Total β-hCG II assay in
triplicate using two reagent lots. The mean measured values of the samples
were within 10% of the expected concentrations of the samples. Results are
summarized below:
Expected Mean VITROS %

13065 13642 4.416
High sample dilution recommendations were evaluated by assaying 10
samples containing high amounts of β-hCG. The samples were diluted both
manually and on the VITROS Immunodiagnostic System with VITROS
Immunodiagnostic Products High Sample Diluent B (HSDB) to 1/2, 1/5, 1/10
and 1/20, 1/100, 1/200 and 1/400. No systematic differences between manual
and on board dilution were observed and both demonstrated acceptable
recoveries.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and Value Assignment: The VITROS Total β-hCG Calibrators
and Range Verifiers are traceable to the WHO β-hCG 4 International
th
Standard.
Calibrators: Primary calibrators are prepared gravimetrically from the 4th
International Standard. A set of 10 Working Calibrators are prepared and
calibrated against the Absolute Calibrators using twenty runs on two
instruments. A second set of Working Calibrators (in-house reference
calibrators) are prepared gravimetrically and calibrated against the first set of
Working Calibrators using 84 assays. For each Reagent Lot, the set of three
Product Calibrators are assigned values using a mean of 20 determinations in
a measurement procedure calibrated with the Working Calibrators. The full
calibration curves from the 20 assays are also used to prepare a “Master
Calibration Curve” specific for that Reagent Lot. This Master Calibration
Curve is provided to each customer’s VITROS Analyzer via a magnetic card.
Range Verifiers: Range Verifiers are tested multiple times across VITROS
Total β-hCG II reagent lots and instruments. The high and low range verifiers
must pass predetermined acceptance criteria for each run. Included in the runs
are the Working Calibrators that are traceable to the 4 International Standard
th
(NIBSC 75/589).
Stability: Freeze-dried and reconstituted calibrator master lots were
evaluated at the proposed storage temperatures as well as at high temperature
to demonstrate accelerated stability of the calibrators and controls. Multiple
lots of the reagent packs were evaluated for open on-board stability. Testing
protocols and data summaries provided were found to be adequate. Freeze-

thaw and elevated temperature (to represent transportation conditions)
stability testing protocols and summaries were provided for reagent packs,
calibrators and controls, and found to be adequate.
d. Detection limit:
The method to determine detection limit is based upon the CLSI document
EP17-A3(“Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of
Quantitation”).
The study ran ten replicates of each blank and five low positive sample pools
with two lots on three instruments for two runs per day for three days using
two different calibrations. The LoB was calculated to be 0.05 mIU/mL. The
LoD was calculated to be 0.70 mIU/mL. The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
was calculated to be 2.39 mIU/mL as determined by the lowest concentration
at which test results of five low-analyte samples had a CV<15%.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference: The VITROS Total β-hCG II assay was evaluated for
interference consistent with CLSI Guideline EP7-A2. To calculate the percent
interference, the mean value of four determinations of a solution of each test
substance was compared with that of a corresponding control in two lots. Of
the compounds tested, none of the compounds tested was found to cause a
bias of more than 10%.
Compound Concentration Tested
Bilirubin 20 mg/dL
Biotin 1000 ng/dL
Dipyrone 100 mg/dL
FSH 400 mIU/mL
Hemoglobin* 500 mg/dL
LH 400 mIU/mL
Sodium Azide 100 mg/dL
Triolein 3000 mg/dL
TSH 250 μIU/mL
* Hemoglobin was added to a series of specimens with hCG concentrations of 0.00 to 10350
mIU/mL (IU/L).
Hook effect: Nine clinical samples and dilutions of the WHO 4th
International Standard (NIBSC 75/589) were diluted in negative plasma.
Triplicate determinations were made with each of two Master Lots. No
evidence of high dose hook was observed in the study up to 1,300,000
mIU/mL.

guideline.
139 patient samples were assayed on both the predicate device (Abbott
ARCHITECT Total β-hCG assay) and the proposed device (VITROS Total β-

hCG II assay). The relationship between the two methods, determined by
Deming Regression, was as follows:
Device = 1.016(Predicate) – 95.0 mIU/mL
Correlation coefficient = 0.989
Standard error of slope = 0.0095
Standard error of intercept = 34.84
b. Matrix comparison:
Blood was drawn from 22 subjects, spiked with various concentrations of
hCG that spanned the measuring range, and processed to produce a full set of
matched specimen types (serum, heparin plasma, EDTA plasma, and citrate
plasma). The percent difference seen when using plasma samples compared
to serum samples was: ≤-4.0% for heparin plasma, ≤0.2% for EDTA plasma,
and ≤0.8% for CAT plasma samples.
