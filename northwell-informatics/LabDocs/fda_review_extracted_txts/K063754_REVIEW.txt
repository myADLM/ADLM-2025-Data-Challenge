I. Device Description:
The Dimension Vista™ BHCG Flex® reagent cartridge is an in vitro diagnostic
device that consists of prepackaged, liquid reagents in a plastic twelve well cartridge
for use on the Dade Behring Dimension Vista™ clinical chemistry system for the
quantitative determination of total beta human chorionic gonadotropin levels in serum
and plasma. The flex cartridge contains antibody-labeled beads, streptavidin-labeled
beads and biotinylated antibody.
The Dimension Vista™ BHCG Calibrator is a liquid product containing human
chorionic gonadotropin in a bovine calf serum matrix with stabilizers and
preservatives. The kit consists of twelve vials, two each of six levels containing 2.0
mL per vial for level A, 1.0 mL per vial for levels B, C, D, and E, 1.5 mL per vial for
level F.
All human source material was tested by FDA-approved methods for HIV-1/2,
HBsAg, and HCV and found to be negative.

Standard:
WHO Standard for HCG, 4th IS, 75/589
Guidance:
CLSI Documents:

Guideline (EP9-A2)
L. Test Principle:
The Dimension Vista BHCG Flex assay is a homogeneous, sandwich
chemiluminescent immunoassay based on LOCI technology. The LOCI reagents
include two synthetic bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-βhCG monoclonal
antibody fragment. The first bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin
and contains photosensitizer dye. The second bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated
with a second anti-βhCG monoclonal antibody and contains chemiluminescent dye.
Sample is incubated with chemibeads and biotinylated antibody to form a bead-
βhCG-biotinylated antibody sandwich. Sensibeads are added and bind to the biotin to
form bead-pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at 680nm generates
singlet oxygen from the Sensibeads which diffuses to the Chemibeads and triggers a
chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting chemiluminescent signal is measured at
612nm and is directly proportional to the free and intact β human chorionic
gonadotropin concentration in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To evaluate precision, the within-lab and repeatability of the Dimension Vista
BHCG Flex assay was calculated using the CLSI EP5-A2 method. Two serum
pools and one control were tested in duplicate during two runs per day over 20
days. The results were as follows:

High pool 417 5.9 1.4 8.5 2.0
Control 1 5 0.2 3.2 0.2 3.6
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range for this assay is 1-1000 mIU/mL. Linearity across this
range was established by pooling four serum samples with high β-hCG
concentrations and diluting with water. The eleven samples/dilutions all
recovered within 10% of the expected value.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability: Shelf life for this calibrator is 12 months. Product is stored at 2-8
°C throughout the testing cycle and tested at the following time intervals:
months 0, ¼, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13. The control/reference material is the
same lot stored at -20°C and tested at the same frequency. The test calibrator
material values are recovered versus the calibrations with the control material.
Recovery versus time is monitored and percent change over time is
determined. Acceptance criteria are changes in value ≤ 2 SD for Level 1 and
less than 5% for Levels 2-6.
Open well stability and on board stability testing protocols for the flex
cartridges and the acceptance criteria were described and found to be
acceptable.
Traceability and Value Assignment: The calibrator master pools are made by
adding quantities of purified hCG into bovine calf serum with preservatives.
The master lot (5 levels) is stored at -20°C and values are assigned by using
the Dimension Vista clinical chemistry instrument and referenced to the WHO
standard for HCG, 4th IS, 75/589. Commercial lots of the calibrator are
produced by addition of analyte to bovine calf serum. The concentration of
each level of the commercial calibrator lots is verified by using an instrument
calibrated with the master pools. The final bottle values for each level of the
commercial lot are assigned using three instruments by testing N > 40
replicates.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical sensitivity (or limit of the blank) was determined by assaying
twenty consecutive replicates of the analyte free (0 level) calibrator on the
Dimension Vista BHCG Flex assay. The sensitivity was then calculated by
multiplying the standard deviation by two and adding it to the absolute value
of the mean. The limit of the blank was calculated to be 0.0425 mIU/mL, but
the analyzer does not report a reading less than 1.0 mIU/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity: Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), luteinizing hormone
(LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), prolactin, and human growth
hormone (hGH) were spiked into serum to evaluate cross-reactivity. No
detectable cross-reactivity was observed for 2500 µIU/mL TSH, 1000

Interference: The Dimension Vista BHCG Flex assay was evaluated for
interference using CLSI Document EP7-A2 as a guideline. Hemoglobin
(1000 mg/dL), Bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated at 60 mg/dL) and
Lipids (3000 mg/dL) did not affect the performance of the assay when 25
mIU/mL bhCG was tested. The sponsor defines interference as results
exceeding +/-10% of the expected value. Other substances, including various
prescription and over-the-counter drugs, were tested and shown not to
interfere with this assay.
Hook effect: Hook effect was evaluated using samples containing β-hCG
concentrations ranging from 0 - 3,000,000 mIU/mL. Samples consisted of
Scripps hCG antigen spiked into bovine calf serum material. The results
demonstrated that samples with hCG concentrations up to 3,000,000 mIU/mL
do not give results within the assay measuring range.
