L. Test Principle:
The Dimension Vista CTNI method is a one-step sandwich chemiluminescent
immunoassay based on Luminescent Oxygen Channeling Immunoassay (LOCI)
technology. The LOCI reagents consists of two latex bead reagents and a reagent
containing a biotinylated anti-cardiac troponin I monoclonal antibody fragment. The
first bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains
photosensitizer dye. The second bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a second
anti-cardiac troponin I monoclonal antibody and contains chemiluminescent dye. The
sample is incubated with Chemibeads and biotinylated antibody to form a
particle/cardiac troponin I/biotinylated antibody sandwich. Sensibeads are then added
and bind to the biotin to form bead-aggregated immunocomplexes. Illumination of
the complex by light at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads, which
diffuses into the Chemibeads and triggers a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting
chemiluminescent signal is measured at 612 nm and is a direct function of the cardiac
troponin concentration in the sample.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was performed over a period of 20 days following the
CLSI EP5-A2 guideline and included four serum pools with TnI at 4 different
levels (0.07, 0.43, 22.5 and 30.6 ng/mL) and one commercial control.
Repeatability ranged from 1.0-3.8% CV and within lab imprecision ranged
from 1.05-7.36% CV.
Limit of Quantitation was evaluated by determining the total imprecision of
serum samples with levels of TnI ranging from 0.033 to 0.16 ng/mL. Two
replicates of each sample were tested once per day for 20 days. The limit of
quantitation was determined to be 0.04 ng/mL and corresponds to a coefficient
of variation (CV) of 10%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range of the assay is 0.015 to 40 ng/mL.
Linearity was evaluated by comparing the observed versus expected values
obtained with the Dimension Vista CTNI method. Two natural troponin I
samples, one serum and one heparinized plasma, at TnI concentrations
approximately 45 ng/mL, were mixed with Sample Diluent in different
proportions across the range of the assay. Test sample TnI concentrations
ranged from 4 to 34 ng/mL. The observed results recovered in the range of 98-
105% of the expected TnI values.
High dose hook effect was evaluated by testing normal human sera spiked
with troponin I at high concentrations up to 1010 ng/mL. No hook effect was
observed with samples up to this level.
The Dimension Vista system will report an error code to the user when the
signal generated by high level TnI samples exceeds 40 ng/mL. The labeling
states that samples above 40 ng/mL may be manually diluted with Sample
Diluent at no greater than a 1:5 ratio and retested. Dilution was reviewed
previously under k053577.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Not applicable.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity was defined as the concentration corresponding to
two standard deviations above the mean of a sample containing no troponin I
(n=20). Twenty replicates of the Dimension Vista CTNI calibrator Level A (0
ng/mL) were evaluated in the CTNI assay and resulted in an analytical
sensitivity ~0.015 ng/mL.
4

--- Page 5 ---
The Limit of Quantitation is 0.04 ng/mL (see precision section above).
e. Analytical specificity:
Evaluation of analytical specificity (cross-reactivity) was done by first spiking
each cross-reactant to target concentration into a serum sample. Then, a
control for each cross-reactant was prepared by spiking the samples with the
same volume of the solvent used for reconstituting the cross-reactant. The
cross-reactant test samples and the control samples were measured on the
Dimension Vista and the cross-reactivity was calculated.
Cross-reactant Concentration % Cross-reactivity
Troponin-C (cardiac) 1000 ng/mL None
Troponin-T (cardiac human) 1000 ng/mL 0.05
Troponin-I (skeletal human) 1000 ng/mL 0.14
Troponin-I (skeletal human) 280 ng/mL 0.11
The sponsor followed the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline for interference testing. The
sponsor defined interference as a difference in recovery between the test
sample and control greater than 10%. Hemoglobin hemolysate (up to 500
mg/dL), conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin (up to 60 mg/dL), and lipid
(up to 3000 mg/dL) did not interfere with the test.
A panel of commonly ingested substances, over-the-counter drugs and cardiac
drugs did not interfere with the assay. This claim was previously reviewed
under k053577.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Serum samples were tested on the Dade Behring Dimension Vista CTNI and
the Dimension RxL test system using CLSI EP9-A2 as a guide. Deming
regression was used for the analysis.
Mean values of duplicate samples were used for both methods. Since the AMI
cut-off of the device is stated to be 0.6-1.5 ng/mL, performance at the lower,
medically significant part of the assay range (TnI < 10 ng/mL) was
characterized in addition to the full assay range. The following table shows
regression coefficient estimates along with their 95% confidence intervals.

b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor demonstrated equivalence between serum and heparinized
plasma by method comparison of sixty-three (63) matched sample sets on the
Dimension Vista CTNI method. The samples ranged in TnI value from
approximately 0.026 to 24 ng/mL. Analysis by linear least squares regression
yielded the following equation:
y (lithium heparin plasma)= 1.02x (serum) + 0.031; r=0.999
Equivalence between lithium and sodium heparinized plasma was
demonstrated by method comparison of fifty (50) matched sample sets on the
Dimension Vista CTNI method. The samples ranged in TnI value from
approximately 0.1 to 38 ng/mL. Analysis by linear least squares regression
yielded the following equation:
y (sodium heparin)= 0.99x (lithium heparin) - 0.05; r=0.998
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
A cut-off range of 0.6-1.5 ng/mL was established for the Dade Behring Stratus
Cardiac TnI assay in k951890. A previous method comparison study (k973650)
with the Cardiac Troponin I method for the Dimension RxL demonstrated
substantial equivalence of that assay to the Stratus Cardiac TnI assay. A method
comparison of the current device to Dimension RxL was performed to support the
current Dimension Vista TnI assay (see method comparison section 2(a) above).
5. Expected values/Reference range:
In a study of 150 matched serum and plasma samples from apparently healthy
individuals, the upper limit of the 99th percentile for the Dimension VISTA™
CTNI method was determined to be approximately 0.04 ng/mL for both matrices.
