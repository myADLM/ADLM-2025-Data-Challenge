L. Test Principle:
When a sample containing transferrin is mixed with the duck anti-transferrin
antibodies, the resulting agglutination based on the antigen-antibody reaction
increases the turbidity of the sample. The value of the absorbance change at 505nm is
proportional to the transferrin concentration of the sample and is recorded by the
instrument. The transferrin concentration of the serum sample is determined by
comparison to a standard curve. The calibration curve is generated by running 6
standards with known concentrations.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three samples with three different levels of transferrin were prepared. For
within run precision, each level was assayed 10 times.

were made of the 100 and the 700 mg/dL calibrators. Linear regression
analyses yielded R2 values of 0.9995 and 0.9982 for the low range and the
high range respectively.

Prozone Effect: Diluted samples were prepared from the transferrin standard
(2,000 mg/dL). No hook effect was observed for the tested specimens up to
2,000 mg/dL compared to the upper limit of the measuring range of 700
mg/dL.
The assay reportable range is from 10 to 700 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended calibrators are standardized against the Certified Reference
Material, CRM 470. The calibrators are assigned values of 0, 50, 100, 200,
400 and 700 mg/dL. The zero calibrator is stable for 19 months and
calibrators 50 – 700 mg/mL are stabile for 4 years unopened and at the
recommended storage conditions of 2°C - 10°C.
d. Detection Limit:
The detection limit was calculated as 2 SD above the mean response for the
zero calibrator when assayed 20 times and was 0.4 mg/dL. The detection
limit claim is 10 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed by spiking different levels of each
interferant into low and high transferrin serum samples. Percent recoveries
ranged from 94.4 to 106.6%. The following concentrations of potential
interferants were tested.
Potential interferant Concentration
Bilirubin F 60 mg/dL
Bilirubin C 60 mg/dL
Chyle 2,940 FTU
RF 500 IU/mL
Hemoglobin 1,000 mg/dL
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Serum samples from 82 patients were tested with the new device and the
predicate. Transferrin values for the samples ranged from 33.0 to 648.5
mg/dL. Linear Regression Analysis showed: y = 0.927x + 19.784 mg/dL
with a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.992.

interval may vary with the populations studied and individual laboratories should
establish their own. The reference range is based on the published article, Dati F,
et al. Consensus of a group of professional societies and diagnostic companies on
guidelines for interim reference ranges for 14 proteins in serum based on the
standardization against the IFCC/BCR/CAP reference material (CRM 470). Eur J

N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
