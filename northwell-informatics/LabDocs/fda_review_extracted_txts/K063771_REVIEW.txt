L. Test Principle:
The sample (whole blood) is drawn by capillary action at the tip of the test strip. Glucose in
the sample reacts with glucose dehydrogenase and Hexaammineruthenium(III) chloride in
the test strip, producing Hexaammineruthenium(II) chloride. Hexaammineruthenium(II)
chloride is produced in proportion to the glucose concentration of the blood sample.
Oxidation of the Hexaammineruthenium(II) chloride produces an electric current. The meter
converts to the glucose concentration and displays it as the test result.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range of the assay is from 20 mg/dL to 600 mg/dL. Linearity was
combined with a temperature range study by testing venous blood adjusted to 11
glucose concentrations. The samples ranged from 17 mg/dL to 762 mg/dL and were
tested five times each using the Glucocard X-System at 10°C, 25°C, and 40°C. The
17 mg/dL gave a “Lo” reading and the 762 mg/dL sample gave a “Hi” reading for all
replicates tested. The remaining 9 samples ranged in concentration from 21 mg/dL to
584 mg/dL. The Glucocard X-System results showed agreement with the expected

values at all glucose concentrations tested. The regression equations from the
Glucocard X-Meter measurements compared to the expected values performed at
three temperatures were as follows
10°C: y=1.0786x – 9.1001 with an R2 value of 0.996
25°C: y=1.0283x - 7.0234 with an R2 value of 0.998
40°C: y=0.9738x + 3.6443 with an R2 value of 0.998
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The control solutions are prepared at three target concentrations by addition of
glucose to an aqueous matrix. The glucose concentrations of the control solutions are
traceable to NIST SRM 917b8.
Shelf life studies show that the unopened test strips have a 24 month life-span and 3
months shelf-life once a vial of strips is opened. Unopened controls have an 18-month
shelf life and are stable for 3 months opening first use.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit is 20 mg/dL. See linearity/assay reportable range section above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Hematocrit interference was evaluated by adjusting the glucose concentrations and
hematocrit levels of venous blood samples from several donors. In the first study, the
glucose concentrations were adjusted in increments from approximately 30 mg/dL to
515 mg/dL and the hematocrit levels were adjusted to 30%, 42%, and 55%. Each
sample was run n=10 and the percent bias was calculated compared to the 42%
hematocrit samples. Results are summarized in table 1 below. A second study
evaluated more hematocrit concentrations between 42% and 55% and the results of
this study are summarized in table 2. After analysis of both studies, the claim for the
device was for use with samples having hematocrit concentrations ranging from 30%
to 52%.

Interfering substances were dissolved in venous blood samples at several
concentrations each, then these were divided into three aliquots and spiked to nominal
glucose concentrations of 60, 120, and 320 mg/dL. These samples were tested
against control samples which had a blank solvent added at the same volume as the
interferent. Samples were tested n=10 and the percent difference of the interfering
samples was calculated compared to the control samples. The following substances
were tested.

tested at 10,000 ±20 feet in a small non pressurized airplane. The result of each
sample tested at 10,000 feet was within ±10% of the sample tested on the ground.
This demonstrates that the meter may be used up to an altitude of 10,000 feet above
sea level.
Temperature and humidity studies were performed and showed that the meter can be
used at temperatures from 50°F to 104°F and at relative humidity ranging from 20%
to 80%.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison study was performed with 142 capillary fingerstick patient
samples. In order to fully cover the measuring range, 27 of the samples were spiked
with glucose or allowed to glycolyze. The samples ranged in concentration from 24 to
466 mg/dL on the Glucocard X-Meter device and met the ISO 15197 sample
distribution requirements. Samples were measured in singlicate on the Glucocard X-
Meter and in duplicate on the YSI analyzer. An analysis of the results calculated a
slope of 0.982, an intercept of -3.9, and correlationvalue of 0.98. In addition, 98% of
the results were within the ISO 15197:2003 accuracy criteria of 95% of samples with
±15 mg/dL bias for glucose samples ≤ 75 mg/dL and ±20% bias for glucose samples
>75 mg/dL. System accuracy results are presented in the tables below.

In addition a small study was performed to show that the two palm sites (thenar and
hypothenar) demonstrated equivalent performance. In this study 27 patients were
first tested by professional fingerstick. Then both professional and participant
samples were taken from the hypothenar and thenar palm site for each patient.
Sample results ranged from approximately 75 mg/dL to approximately 375 mg/dL.
The results are shown below.

N. Instrument Name:
Glucocard X-Meter
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for each additional
reading.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X___ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood. Since the whole blood
sample is applied directly to the test strip, there are no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
The meter automatically detects the code number when a test strip is inserted. The user
must check to see if the code number the meter displays matches the number on the test
strip vial. If the number matches, the user is instructed to begin testing. If the number
11

--- Page 12 ---
does not match, or if no number appears, the user is instructed to try another test strip. If
this fails the user is instructed to try a new vial of strips and to call customer service if
this also fails. No other calibration is required from the user.
6. Quality Control:
One control level is provided with the device and two additional control levels are
available. The user is instructed to call their supplier or pharmacy to obtain controls and
to call Arkray customer service if the supplier or pharmacy does not stock the controls.
The user is instructed to run controls when the meter is first used in order to verify that
they can use the meter correctly. In addition they are instructed to run a control when a
new vial of test strips is opened, when they suspect the meter or strips are not working
correctly, when test results are not consistent with the patient’s symptoms or the patient
does not think the results are accurate, if the meter is dropped, to check their technique, if
the test strip bottle had been left open or stored outside its recommended temperature
range, or when the Glucocard X-Meter has been stored outside its recommended
temperature range. The acceptable results ranges are shown on the test strip vial label. If
the results are outside the expected range, the user is instructed to repeat the test. If the
repeated test falls outside the range the user is instructed to repeat the test using a new
control solution or test strip. If the control continues to read outside the expected range
the user is told not to use the test system until the control result reads within the
acceptable range.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
