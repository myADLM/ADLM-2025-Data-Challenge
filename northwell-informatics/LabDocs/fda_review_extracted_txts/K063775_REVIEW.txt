The EliA Gliadin IgA wells are coated with gliadin antigen. If present in the patient’s
specimen, antibodies to gliadin will bind to their specific antigen in the wells. After
washing away non-bound antibodies, enzyme- labeled antibodies against human IgA
antibodies (EliA IgA conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex.
After incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away and the bound complex is
incubated with a development solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence
in the reaction mixture is measured. The higher the response value, the more specific
IgA is present in the specimen. To evaluate test results, the response for patient
samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
EliA™ Gliadin IgA
For the ImmunoCAP 100, four samples were measured in duplicates on
four instruments in 26 runs over 9 days with a calibration curve in each
run. For the ImmunoCAP 250, four samples were measured in 3
replicates in 12 runs on two instruments over 6 weeks with a calibration
curve in each run. The studies yielded the following:

For ImmunoCAP 100, four samples were measured in duplicates on three
instruments in 26 runs over 9 days with a calibration curve in each run.
For ImmunoCAP 250, four samples were measured in 3 replicates in 12
runs on two instruments over 6 weeks with a calibration curve in each
run. The studies yielded the following:

4 93.7 3.8 3.8
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was not claimed for this device.
The measuring range for EliA Gliadin IgA and EliA Gliadin IgG are 0.2 to
213 EliA U/mL and 0.2 to 192 EliA U/mL respectively.
High dose hook effect:
For EliA Gliadin IgA, the possibility of antigen excess occurring when using
the device was evaluated with serum sample above the assay measuring range.
No hook effect was observed for concentrations up to 512 µg/mL, which is
about 6 times above the value of the highest calibrator (80 µg/L).
For EliA Gliadin IgG, the possibility of antigen excess occurring when using
the device was evaluated with serum sample above the assay measuring range.
No hook effect was observed for concentrations up to 8200 µg/mL, which is
about 13 times above the value of the highest calibrator (600 µg/L).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The IgA and IgG calibrators are traceable to the International Reference
Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of Human Immunoglobulins A, G, and M from
WHO. New batches of calibrators are compared to a secondary standard
(standardized with the IRP) or the IRP directly and adjusted accordingly to
meet the correct concentration (6 levels). The instrument measures specific

IgA or IgG concentrations in µg/L. To obtain a test specific result, µg/L of
IgA or IgG must be converted to EliA U/mL using a conversion factor.
EliA Celiac Control is prepared from selected pooled human sera. The
controls are prediluted and ready for use. The acceptance ranges for the
current control lot are stated on the Control Certificate included in the
respective EliA Celiac Control kit. The mean values for every lot have been
determined with 4 consecutive control assays, each in 6 replicates. Ranges are
calculated as respective mean ± 3SD for the expected long term variation.
Open-vial stability is not tested as the EliA Celiac control is packaged in
single vials. Closed-vial stability studies were performed with the following
specifications: For the Positive Control, the quota (stressed/reference has to be
equal to or in the range of 0.80 to 1.20. The negative Control should recover
≤2.8 U/mL. Specifications were met. Accelerated stability testing over a
period of 6 weeks at 30oC equals 18 months at 2-8oC.
d. Detection limit:
EliA™ Gliadin IgA
The lower limit of the measuring range was determined by measuring
dilutions (1:2, 1:4, and 1:8) of Calibrator 0.3 (0.3 µg/L) in the Calibrator
Wells. The results in Response Units (RU) were compared with the result of
the sample diluent on EliA Gliadin IgA Wells. The discrimination ability (D)
of the assay should be >2. All samples were measured in triplicate.

The 1/8 diluted calibrator 0.3 (0.0375 µg/L) still can be discriminated from
background given by the signal of the diluent on Gliadin IgA wells. The
lower limit of detection was set at 0.05 µg /L corresponding to 0.2 EliA
U/mL.
EliA™ Gliadin IgG
The lower limit of the measuring range was determined by measuring
dilutions (1:2, 1:4, and 1:8) of Calibrator 4.0 (4.0 µg/L) in the Calibrator
Wells. The results in Response Units (RU) were compared with the result of
the sample diluent on EliA Gliadin IgG Wells. The discrimination ability (D)
of the assay should be >2. All samples were measured in triplicate.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical samples:
Two hundred forty nine (249) patient samples covering the measuring range
were tested with the new devices, EliA Gliadin IgA and EliA Gliadin IgG and
the predicate devices, Varelisa Gliadin IgA and Varelisa Gliadin IgG
respectively. These samples included 98 patients with a diagnosis of Celiac
disease. One hundred fifty one (151) samples were from disease controls:
101 non-CD, normal biopsy
10 ulcerative colitis
10 morbus crohn
20 rheumatoid arthritis
10 rheumatoid factor positive samples
In the assessment of the method comparison studies, the following values
were considered:

serum, EDTA, heparin and citrate plasma samples. For positive and equivocal
serum samples quotas between serum and each type of plasma were
calculated. Mean quota of plasma to serum concentration should be 0.8-1.2
for positive sera. Negative samples should not switch to positive in all serum
and plasma samples. Linear regression comparing the quotas between serum
and each type of plasma for the positive samples was performed and showed:

c. Instrument Platform comparison:
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the performance of EliA
Gliadin IgA and EliA Gliadin IgG are equivalent on the ImmunoCAP 100 and
the ImmunoCAP 250.
For this comparison study, a total of 36 samples distributed over the
measuring range were assayed: 4 negative samples, and 32 positive samples.
All samples were run on three ImmunoCAP 100 instruments and two
ImmunoCAP 250 instruments in two runs and in single replicates. Results of
the comparison study showed y = 0.993x and y = 1.0313x for Gliadin IgA and
IgG respectively where y was ImmunoCAP 250 and x was ImmunoCAP 100.
The correlation coefficient (r) for both Gliadin IgA and IgG was 0.99.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Clinical Specificity:
Ninety eight (98) patients with known diagnosis of Celiac disease and 101
non-CD patients (suspected CD, negative by biopsy) were tested for this
study. See table below for results:
EliA Gliadin IgA
n = 199 >10 U/mL ≤10 U/mL
Sensitivity (95%CI)
CD (98) 69 29
70.4 (60.3-79.2%)
Specificity (95%CI)
Disease

Controls (101)
97.0 (91.6-99.4%)
EliA Gliadin IgG
n = 199 >10 U/mL ≤10 U/mL
Sensitivity (95%CI)
CD (98) 69 29
70.4 (60.3-79.2%)
Specificity (95%CI)
Disease
20 81
Controls (101)
80.2 (71.1-87.5%)
Clinical sensitivity of EliA Gliadin IgA and EliA Gliadin IgG were
comparable to the sensitivities of predicate devices which were 62.7%
(95%CI 51.1-74.3%) and 44.8% (95%CI 32.9-56.7%) for the Varelisa Gliadin
IgA and IgG respectively.
Clinical specificity of EliA Gliadin IgA and EliA Gliadin IgG were

respectively.
