L. Test Principle:
InPlex™ CF Molecular Test amplifies specific regions of the CFTR gene in genomic
DNA extracted from human whole peripheral blood. Each amplified DNA sample is
subsequently mixed with Cleavase®enzyme and buffer then added to a loading port on
an InPlex™ micro-fluidic card. Each InPlex™ card contains eight sample-loading
ports, each connected to 48 independent reaction chambers. Twenty-eight of these
reaction chambers contain dried assay mixes specific for reporting the 23
ACMG/ACOG recommended CFTR mutations and variants. The remaining chambers
consist of a “No Invader® Control,” an independent Quality Control, and several unused
chambers.

The card is then incubated to allow individual Invader®reactions to occur. Following
incubation, the card is read in a multi-well fluorometer and the raw signal data are
imported into the InPlex™ CF Molecular Test Call Reporting Software for final result
analysis. IVS-8 5T, 7T, and 9T results are only displayed for R117H positive (Het or
Mut) samples. The nonsense F508C variant is assessed only for the interpretation of
delI507 and delF508 mutations. The 2183AA>G mutation is assessed only for the
interpretation of the 2184delA mutation and not displayed.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility study was performed in two phases, a proficiency phase,
and a performance phase. The proficiency phase was used to ensure each site
had the required expertise in the methodology to ensure that meaningful data
could be generated and calculated during the performance phase. For the
Proficiency testing, two technicians at each of three investigative sites ran the
same CF panel in duplicate. Data generated during this phase of the study was
to demonstrate technician proficiency only. Reproducibility testing for the
performance phase was conducted using 23 samples containing mutations
representing the ACMG recommended panel. Each site ran the same samples in
duplicate by each technician on each of five (5) non-consecutive days.

Lot-to-Lot Equivalency: Equivalency between three lots of InPlex™ CF
Molecular Test kits was evaluated. A panel of 23 CFTR gDNA samples was
tested in singlicate with each lot. Five hundred twenty-nine (529) genotype
calls were generated for each lot (23 samples x 23 assays). All genotype calls
were in 100% (99.4%, 95% LCB) agreement to pre-characterized gDNA
genotypes for each lot tested.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The reference method was bi-directional sequencing.
Assay Controls: The assay contains a No DNA Control which is used to
indicate if contamination occurred during the amplification step. It is
recommended that the user run CFTR mutation positive control(s) as per
4

--- Page 5 ---
ACMG Standards and Technical Guideline recommendations to insure proper
test results.
Stability: On-going real-time stability studies are being performed on 3 lots
each of InPlex™ micro-fluidic cards and the InPlex™ CF molecular test when
stored under pre-defined conditions. A panel of seven CFTR gDNA samples
and eight control samples comprised of pooled amplicons that cover the
mutations in the InPlex™ CF Molecular Test, providing 345 calls (15 samples x
23 assays), were used to assess the performance. The samples were tested in
duplicate with each lot for each storage condition at each time point. Three lots
of the InPlex™ Reagents are being maintained at the recommended storage
temperature of (-20°C ±3°C). The InPlex™ micro-fluidic cards are stored at the
recommended temperature (-20°C ±3°C), substandard temperature (4°C – 8°C),
and ship-stressed conditions (37°C±1°C for 48 hours, then room temperature
(25°C±3°C). Results to date, indicate 100% agreement with initial results
(T=0). Stability studies are ongoing for which results from future time points
will be used to extend shelf-life dating.
Freeze-Thaw: A study was performed to establish the tolerance of the InPlex™
CF Molecular Test to various freeze-thaw cycles. The InPlex™CF Molecular
Test kit were subjected to 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 freeze-thaw cycles (test points)
followed by functional testing of the product with control samples. Each freeze-
thaw cycle consisted of freezing at -20°C±3°C for at least 24 hours and thawing
at room temperature for 30 minutes. For the multiple freeze-thaw cycles the
cards were returned to -20°C±3°C storage after 30 minutes at room temperature.
An overall percent agreement of 100% (99.92%, 1-sided lower 95% Confidence
Limit) as compared to DNA sequencing for all freeze-thaw cycles tested. Eight
or fewer freeze-thaw cycles for the InPlex™ Molecular Test are recommended
to ensure the InPlex™ CF Molecular Test maintains the ability to generate
accurate genotype calls.
d. Detection limit:
The package insert recommends that the concentration of gDNA should be 15
g/μL. An input genomic DNA concentration range was evaluated with the
InPlex™ CF Molecular Test. A panel of eight gDNA samples were prepared
and tested at eight concentrations ranging from 1 ng/μL to 150 ng/μL (total
input DNA range of 5-750 ng/reaction). Genotype call results for all eight
characterized samples for each of the 23 alleles were assessed for percent
agreement at each concentration. The lower limit of detection was defined as
the lowest DNA concentration in which a 99% or greater concordance with
DNA sequencing was observed.
Based on these results, a 5 ng/μL DNA concentration (input DNA of 25 ng)
provided a percent agreement of 100% (98.4%, 95% LCB) with DNA
sequencing qualifying it as the lower limit of detection. At the highest DNA
concentration tested, 150 ng/μL (input DNA of 750 ng), a 99.5% percent
agreement was obtained (98.6%, 95% LCB). The remaining DNA
concentrations tested, 10, 20, 50, and 100 ng/μl (input DNA of 50, 100, 250 and
500 ng) all obtained a 100 percent agreement (98.4%, 95% LCB) with expected
results.

e. Analytical specificity:
The following interfering substances were added separately to aliquots of 8
different CF positive whole blood samples, prior to extraction, and compared to
an untreated sample. The following substances were added to the final
calculated concentration indicated: bilirubin (10 mg/dL), triglycerides (250
mg/dL), and potassium EDTA (2.16 mg/ml). Qiagen® Buffer AW2 and
hemoglobin were added to pre-extracted gDNA to a concentration of ~5% and
0.01% respectively. No interference was observed by the potential interferants
when compared to the untreated sample or bi-directional sequencing.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Accuracy and repeat rate of the InPlex™ CF Molecular Test were determined
by comparing InPlex™ CF Molecular Test genotyping results from gDNA
isolated from 123 samples, representing a total of 144 CF mutations and
variants were compared to bi-directional sequencing. The sample panel
consisted of 96 clinical samples (gDNA samples isolated from whole peripheral
blood) and 27 gDNA samples isolated from commercially available cell lines.
The 123 samples used in this study were only extracted one time and tested.
The extracted DNA was diluted in nuclease-free ultra pure water to
concentrations that ranged from 10 ng/μL to 25 ng/μL. Aliquots were then sent
for bi-directional DNA sequence analysis and tested with the InPlex™ CF
Molecular Test. Twenty-one samples contained mutations not covered by the
InPlex™ CF Molecular Test (13 WT/non-ACMG heterozygotes and 9
ACMG/non-ACMG compound heterozygotes), including two 2183AA>G used
to accurately assess the 2184delA mutation, are reported as Wild Type by the
assay. Accuracy results were compared to DNA sequencing for these samples,
all mutations were Wild Type (Normal) for the 23 mutations included in the
product. Table 2 summarizes the DNA sequencing based genotype results for
the 123 test samples.
A total of 23 CFTR mutations were tested in this study, with the IVS8-
5T/7T/9T variant being reported for R117H positive samples only. Genotype
calls were compared between the DNA sequencing results and the InPlex™ CF
Molecular Test results for the calculation of overall agreement. In addition,
positive and negative agreement for each mutation was calculated (Table 3a).
The repeat rate (0.8%) was determined by the number of samples that generated
an invalid genotype call for one or more mutations with the InPlex™ CF
Molecular Test on the first attempt. The no-call rate was calculated as the
number of invalid genotype calls of the total number of calls.

(*) In the initial study, four (4) samples confirmed by sequencing as 7T/9T, were called 7T/7T by the CF Inplex Molecular Test.
Upon retesting all four (4) samples gave the correct 7T/9T result once per day for five consecutive days.
The IVS8-5T/7T/9T genotyping accuracy was assessed by the manufacturer on all the 123
samples used in the Method Comparison study. The IVS-8 results for four non-R117H
samples were miscalled as 7T/7T instead of 7T/9T according to bi-directional sequencing
resulting in an initial miscall rate of 0.14% (Table 3b).
The four miscalled samples were tested in a reproducibility study once a day for 5 days in
conjunction with two 7T/7T and two 7T/9T samples, which were called correctly in the
initial study. Upon retesting all four (4) miscalled samples gave the correct 7T/9T result on
each of the five consecutive days (Table 4). The root cause of the miscalls was determined
to potentially be due to the InPlex cards failing to be rotated during incubation resulting in
temperature inconsistencies (e.g., hot spots) near the heat source causing the 9T/7T ratio to
fall below the cut-off for the 9T/7T call. The 7T/7T miscall was reproduced in one of the
four samples experimentally.

N. Software:
The InPlex™ CF CRS is an Excel® template created and validated using Microsoft
Excel® 2000. Excel® formulas, functions, and Microsoft® Visual Basic® 6.0 (VBA)
were used to create the software. Four worksheets are visible to the user: Mix
Worksheet, Sample Placement, Executive Summary, and Sample Summary. The Mix
Worksheet allows the user to calculate the volume of reagents needed for an individual
run. The user may enter component lot numbers and expiration dates, operator name,
run ID, and run date. All cells are locked except those where the user can enter
information. The worksheet is password protected. The sample placement worksheet
allows the user to label the locations of each sample on each card within a run. The
Sample and Executive summaries display the results for each sample on a card for each
mutation and a condensed display for the run, respectively. Results of the IVS-8
variants are only displayed if the sample is heterozygous or homozygous for the R117H
mutation. The F508C variant and 2183AA>G mutation are assessed for all samples for
the purposes of correctly calling the delF508, delI507, and 2184delA mutations,
respectively, but not displayed. The software displays an “Invalid” result for any
sample failing to meet the quality controls for result validity (e.g., equivocal, low
signal, or increase gain).
O. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
P. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
