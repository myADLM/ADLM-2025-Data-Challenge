I. Device Description:
Diagnostic Hybrids D3 DFA Herpes Simplex Virus Identification Kit includes a DFA
Reagent that contains a blend of four fluorescein-labeled murine monoclonal
antibodies directed against a blend of 4 murine MAbs directed against two antigens
of HSV-1 and two antigens of HSV-2. The kit includes the following components:
1. HSV DFA Reagent – A blend of fluorescein labeled murine monoclonal antibodies
directed against 4 murine MAbs directed against two antigens of HSV-1 and two
antigens of HSV-2 produced from HSV-infected cell culture. The buffered,
stabilized, aqueous solution contains Evan’s Blue as a counter-stain and 0.1%
sodium azide as preservative.
2. HSV Antigen Control Slides - Individually packaged control slides containing wells
with cell culture derived positive and negative control cells. Each HSV positive well
is identified. The negative wells contain uninfected cells. Each slide is intended to
be stained only one time.
3. PBS Concentrate - A 40X concentrate consisting of 4% sodium azide in phosphate
buffered saline (after dilution to 1X in water, the concentration of sodium azide in
the solution is 0.1%).
4. Mounting Fluid - an aqueous, buffered, stabilized solution of glycerol and 0.1%
sodium azide.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): N/A
L. Test Principle:
The test kit uses a blend of four viral antigen-specific murine MAbs which are
directly labeled with fluorescein for rapid identification of HSV in cell culture.
The cells to be tested, derived from cell culture, are fixed in acetone. The HSV DFA
Reagent is added to the cells to determine the presence of viral antigens. After
incubating at 35ºC to 37ºC, the stained cells are rinsed with the diluted PBS
Concentrate, a drop of the supplied Mounting Fluid is added and a coverslip is placed
on the prepared cells. The cells are examined using a fluorescence microscope.
HSV-infected cells will be stained with viral specific apple-green fluorescence when
stained with the HSV DFA Reagent while uninfected cells will contain no
fluorescence but will be stained dull red by the Evan’s Blue counter-stain.

d. Detection limit: This testing is not considered necessary during premarket
notification process because performance testing has been done using a
comparative device in amplified cell culture (cell culture is not part of the review
process for this device).
e. Analytical specificity:
i The HSV D3 DFA Reagent was tested for cross-reactivity against a wide
variety of cells and microorganisms. No cross-reactivity was observed for 59
viral strains (cultured and processed for staining) or for 17 host culture cell
types.
1. Depending on the particular virus used, a concentration of 150 to 715
TCID of selected virus was inoculated into shell vial or multiwell plate
50
cultures and incubated for 24 to 48 hours to yield what was considered a
1+ to 3+ cytopathic effect. Only confluent monolayer cell cultures were
stained. The culture was processed and stained with the DFA reagent at a
1.5X working dilution concentration and processed according to the
procedure detailed in each respective product insert. Stained cells were
examined at 200x magnification.
ii Twenty-seven (27) bacterial cultures, one yeast and one protozoan culture
were stained and examined for cross-reactivity, including Staphylococcus
aureus, a protein-A-producing bacterium. Staining of S. aureus appeared as
small points of fluorescence while all other cultures were negative.
1. Bacteria and yeast were cultured, processed as suspensions, and then
spotted onto microscopic slides (having CFUs ranging from 6.4x104 to
2.93x107/well, depending on the bacterium), and stained with the DFA
reagent at a 1.5X working dilution concentration and processed according
to each respective product insert. Stained slides were examined at 400X
magnification. Some of the microorganisms listed below were procured
from an external source as prepared microscope slides (marketed for
quality control use).
2. Such binding can be distinguished from viral antigen binding on the basis
of morphology, i.e., S. aureus-bound fluorescence appears as small (~1
micron diameter), bright punctuate dots.
iii Various conditions for cross-reactivity testing were achieved by using a
relatively high concentration of the HSV D3 DFA Reagent (1.5X) and testing
relatively high titers of microorganisms commensurate with infectious states
in human. The HSV D3 DFA Reagent was prepared at 1.5X the concentration
that is provided in the kit.

Comparative studies included five hundred and thirty (530) prospectively
collected specimens submitted for HSV culture. Each specimen was evaluated by
the D3 DFA HSV Identification Kit and compared to a currently marketed HSV
identification kit. A combination of fresh (250) and frozen (280) specimens were
tested. Although fresh and frozen specimen results are normally presented

considered acceptable because direct patient specimen testing was not performed
at all sites. Only cell culture confirmation with this device was performed.
Evaluations were conducted at three external laboratory sites located in the mid-
west United States and one in-house virology laboratory. Three specimens from
site 4 were not evaluated due to bacterial contamination of the monolayers,
leaving 527 for analysis. Each of the study sites tested different legally marketed
HSV kits as comparison devices.
Percent Agreement between the D3 DFA HSV and Comparison Devices was
calculated and tabulated for all the tested specimens, and is presented in the Table
below. Data are represented as positive and negative percent agreement between
D3 DFA HSV Kit and a comparative device (statistically calculating the 95
percent confidence interval for each positive and negative percent agreement by
the exact method).
