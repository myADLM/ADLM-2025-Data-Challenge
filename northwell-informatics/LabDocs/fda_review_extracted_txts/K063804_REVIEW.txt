K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI EP5-A2, CLSI EP9-A, CLSI EP7-A, CLSI EP14-A
L. Test Principle:
Olympus Triglyceride procedure is based on a series of coupled enzymatic reactions.
The triglycerides in the sample are hydrolyzed by a combination of microbial lipases
to give glycerol and fatty acids. The glycerol is phosphorylated by adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) in the presence of glycerol kinase (GK) to produce glycerol-3-
phosphate. The glycerol-3-phosphate is oxidized by molecular oxygen in the
presence of glycerol phosphate oxidase (GPO) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H O )
2 2
and dihyproxyacetone phosphate. The formed H O reacts with 4-aminophenazone
2 2
and N, N-bis (4-sulfobutyl) -3,5 dimethylaniline, disodium salt (MADB) in the
presence of peroxidase (POD) to produce a chromophore, which is read at 660/800
nm. The increase in absorbance at 600/800 nm is proportional to the triglyceride
content of the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Estimates of precision were based on CLSI EP5-A2 guidelines by testing a low,
medium and high human serum pool, in duplicate twice a day for 20 days.
Assays of serum pools were analyzed on the Olympus AU400, Olympus AU600,

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity studies performed support the sponsor’s claimed measuring
range of 10 to 1000 mg/dL. Studies were performed on the Olympus AU400,
Olympus AU640, and Olympus AU2700 analyzers. A series of analyte
concentrations covering the entire measuring range (sample range was 0 –
1098 mg/dL) were prepared by dilution of a high pool sample. The best fit
line was calculated using a validated excel template by linear regression and
the deviations of the data from linearity were examined. The results all met
the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of ± 5% for the range of 10-1000 mg/dL or ±
6 mg/dL below 248 mg/dL.

d. Detection limit:
The limit of the blank was determined by testing an analyte-free sample
twenty times each on the AU400, AU640 and AU2700 analyzers. The value
was determined by calculating the absolute mean plus 3 standard deviations.
The lowest detectable levels are 0.31 mg/dL for AU400, 0.31 mg/dL for
AU640 and 0.26 mg/dL for AU2700.
The limit of quantitation was determined by testing 3 pools of patient samples
with values below the lower point of the measuring range of 10 mg/dL 40
times over a one month period of time. The lowest level of triglyceride was
determined to be 3.47 mg/dL for AU400, 4.07 mg/dL for AU640 and 4.09
mg/dL for AU2700 at which the CV was less than 20%. The results support
the limit of quantitation claim of 5mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity studies were performed based on CLSI Guideline EP7-
A. Studies performed on the AU400, AU 600 and AU2700 demonstrated ≤ 3
% interference from bilirubin up to 40 mg/dL, ≤ 3% interference from
hemolysate up to 500 mg/dL and ≤ 5% interference from ascorbate up to 20
mg/dL.
The labeling contains the limitation that when using enzymatic methodologies
for triglyceride, samples which are extremely lipemic with triglyceride levels
typically exceeding 1700 mg/dL, results can be erroneously reported as being
within the linear range of the assay. In order to identify grossly lipemic
samples, Data Check Parameters are provided. If the reaction kinetics of a test
exhibits the characteristics of an elevated triglyceride sample, the result will
be flagged. The labeling states that grossly lipemic samples may, under rare
circumstance, evade the Data Check Parameters and should routinely be
diluted 1 part sample to 4 parts saline prior to analysis and the results
multiplied by 5.

Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed based on CLSI EP9-A using 148
serum samples with values ranging from 13 – 953 mg/dL. The samples were
run with the predicate Olympus Triglyceride Reagent (k961274) on the
Olympus AU640 analyzer. The same samples were run on the Olympus
AU640, AU400, and AU2700 analyzers using the Olympus Triglyceride Test
System (k063804). The results are displayed in the table below.
