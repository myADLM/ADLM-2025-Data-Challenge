3. Special condition for use statement
Prescription Use Only
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
This submission is for the AST panel only. The ID system was not reviewed.
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for the AST
Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and
equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™
Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST broth, which contains an AST
indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST broth is a cation-adjusted broth
containing Tween 80. After adding the indicator solution to the AST inoculum, the color
is blue, and after inoculation and incubation, it changes to pink then colorless as
reduction in the panel well proceeds. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded
into the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System instrument where the panels are
continuously incubated at 35°C. The resulting AST has a final inoculum of 5 x 105
CFU/ml. The instrument incubates, reads and records the results of the biochemical
substrates and antimicrobial agents and interprets the reactions to give a MIC value and
category interpretation of the antimicrobial agents. Organisms growing in the presence
of a given antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator, signaling organism growth and
resistance to the antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or inhibited by a given
antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do not produce a color
change. Additional interpretation is done using software driven “EXPERT” System
using rules derived from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI).
Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an AST result available between 4-16 hours.
This is only an autoread result; there are no manual readings possible.

L. Test Principle:
The AST portion of the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth
based microdilution method that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-
reduction) to enhance detection of organism growth. The MIC is determined by
comparing growth in wells containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the
growth in “growth control wells” which contain no antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility
Fourteen isolates were evaluated. The overall inter-site demonstrated
>95% reproducibility and an overall intra-site of > 95%. The ten isolate
study described in the guidance document was used (10 organisms tested 3
times on 3 days at 3 sites).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or method
The FDA recommended Quality Control isolate E. coli ATCC 25922
was performed during the testing of all isolates on each day of testing with
the following results. The table below includes the concentrations tested
around the expected range with the frequency of the reference and the
Phoenix™ results at each concentration. The Phoenix™ was tested a
sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the system can produce QC
results in the recommended ranges most of the time.

Inoculum density control: The organism suspension density of the ID
broth was equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard using the BBL™
CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer which was verified each day of testing.
Internal data was used to demonstrate that the use of the BBL™
CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer would produce reproducible results. Five
different instruments were used.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The broth dilution reference panel was prepared according to the CLSI
recommendation and used to compare with the Phoenix™ results. Clinical
testing was performed at four sites on 874 clinical isolates and compared with
the reference method results performed at the same time. An additional 182
challenge isolates were tested and compared to an expected result,
determined by repeated reference testing. The test device had a growth rate of
>95%. A comparison was provided to the reference method with the
following agreement.

EA-Essential Agreement maj-major discrepancies
CA-Category Agreement vmj-very major discrepancies
R-resistant isolates min- minor discrepancies
Essential agreement (EA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panels agree with the
reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the
reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panel
result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation.
Evaluable (Eval) are results that are within the test range and on scale.
The EA and CA were within acceptable limits. The overall vmj rate was 1.3%
(5/391), maj rate was 1.1% (7/627) and the min rate was 2.9% (31/1056). Of the
31 min, 22 were within essential agreement.
