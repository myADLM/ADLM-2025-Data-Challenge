Providencia stuartii and the addition of organism groups using a new
formulation of aztreonam.
3. Special condition for use statement:
Prescription Use Only.
4. Special Instrument Requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
This Submission is for the AST panel only. The ID system was not
reviewed.
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-
wells containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for the
AST Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be
preliminarily identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then
suspended in broth, and equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to
use the BD CrystalSpec ™ Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST
broth, which contains an AST indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST
broth is a cation-adjusted broth containing Tween 80. After adding the indicator
solution to the AST inoculum, the color is blue, and after inoculation and
incubation, it changes to pink then colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds.
Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix ™
Automated Microbiology System instrument where the panels are continuously
incubated at 35 °C. The resulting AST has final inoculum of 5 x 10^5 CFU/ml.
The Phoenix ™ AST Broth is poured into the inoculation port of the 51-well side
(left side) of the Phoenix Combo (ID/AST) panel. This side contains the ID
substrates. The Phoenix AST Broth is poured into inoculation port of the 85-well
side (right) of the Phoenix Combo panel. This side contains the antimicrobial
agents. The inocula flow down the panel in serpentine fashion, filling the panel
wells as the liquid front progresses toward the pad at the bottom of the panel. The
pad absorbs excess inoculum. Polyethylene caps are applied to seal the inoculation

ports. An air admittance port is located in the divider area of the panel lid to ensure
adequate oxygen tension in the panel for the duration of the test. The instrument
reads and records the results of the biochemical substrates and antimicrobial agents
contained in the panel and interprets the reactions to give an identification (ID) of
the isolate, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values and category
interpretations, S, I, or R (sensitive, intermediate, and resistant). The instrument
takes readings every 20 minutes with an AST result available between 4-16 hours.
This is only an autoread result; there are no manual readings possible.

K. Standard / Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S16) “Methods
for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard.”
L. Test Principle:
The AST portion of the BD Phoenix ™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth
based microdilution method that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-
reduction) to enhance detection of organism growth. The MIC is determined by
comparing growth in wells containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to
the growth in “growth control wells” which contain no antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable)
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/ Reproducibility
Inter-site and Intra-site testing demonstrated >95% reproducibility for
aztreonam. One site had to repeat testing on one organism due to an
instrument error. The ten isolate study described in the guidance document
was used (at least 10 organisms tested 3 times on 3 days at 3 sites).
b. Linearity / assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
method)
Quality Control was performed in the Phoenix™ System each day of the
accuracy study. The tables below include the concentrations tested around
the expected range with the frequency of the reference and the Phoenix™
System results at each concentration.

Phoenix ™ System produced acceptable QC results for aztreonam as compared to the
reference method results. The results were within the expected result range. The mode for
the Phoenix ™ results is the same as the mode produced by the reference method.
No QC trending was observed.
Inoculum density control: The organism suspension density of the ID broth was
equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard using BBL CrystalSpec™ or BD PhoenixSpec™
nephelometer which was verified each day of testing.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The broth dilution reference panel was prepared according to the CLSI
recommendation and used to compare with the Phoenix™ results. Clinical testing
was performed at four sites. The testing included both fresh clinical isolates and
stock isolates along with a challenge set with known results. There were 1403
isolates overall tested, 1110 were clinical isolates and 293 were challenge isolates.
The clinical isolates were comprised of 799 (72.0%) fresh isolates, 245 (22.0%)
recent isolates, and 66 (6.0%) stock isolates. The performance data is shown in the
table below:

EA- Essential Agreement Maj – Major discrepancies
CA- Category Agreement Vmj – Very major discrepancies
R – Resistant isolates Min - Minor discrepancies
S – Sensitive isolates Eval - Evaluable
Essential agreement (EA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panels agree with the
reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the
reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the
BD Phoenix™ panel result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference
panel result interpretation. Evaluable results (Eval) are those that fall
within the test range of the reference method and could also be on-scale
with the new device if within the plus/minus one well variability.
The overall performance of the clinical and challenge is acceptable with acceptable
discrepancy rates according to the acceptance criteria in AST Guidelines. There is
a slight trending for the Phoenix ™ System to be more resistant than the reference
method. However, the EA of the Evaluable data showed a combined value of
92.7% which is acceptable.
The device had an acceptable overall growth rate of >95%.

5. Expected values/ Reference range:
Enterobacteriaceae and Non-Enterobacteriaceae :
≤ 8 (S) = Susceptible ; 16 (I) = Intermediate; ≥32 (R) = Resistant
The expected value range, interpretative criteria and QC are included in the
package insert. The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirement of 21 CFR
Part 809.10.
N. Conclusion:
This demonstrates acceptable performance as described in the FDA guidance document,
“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST)
Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA” and therefore the testing of aztreonam 0.5- 64
µg/mL on the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System for the removal of the
limitation for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the removal of the truncation for Providencia
stuartii and the addition of organism groups is substantially equivalent.
