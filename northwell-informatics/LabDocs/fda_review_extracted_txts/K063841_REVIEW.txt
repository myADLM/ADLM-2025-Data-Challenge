H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The NMR LipoProfile® test, when used with the NMR Profiler, an automated NMR
spectrometer, measures lipoprotein particles to quantify LDL particle number (LDL-P), HDL
cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides in serum and plasma using nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. LDL-P and these NMR-derived concentrations of
triglycerides and HDL-C are used in conjunction with other lipid measurements and clinical
evaluation to aid in the management of lipoprotein disorders associated with cardiovascular
disease. The test is performed and provided as a service by Liposcience Laboratory.
2. Indication(s) for use:
See intended use, above.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
This device is cleared as a service (in-house). Samples are sent to Liposcience Laboratories
to be run on the Lipoprofile II NMR, using the system’s software.
I. Device Description:
The test system includes a 400 MHz proton NMR spectrometer interfaced with a commercial
sample handler, an analysis server containing the software to analyze digitized spectral data, and
the following reagents:

3. Comparison with predicate:
The device is similar in indications to the predicate assays, i.e., to quantify lipoprotein,
HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides in serum and plasma to aid in the
management of lipoprotein disorders associated with cardiovascular disease. However,
the test principles, technology, and one of the measurands differ between the devices.
This device measures NMR signals and uses an algorithm developed by the
manufacturer, to calculate concentrations of LDL particle number, high density
lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. The predicate devices utilize colorimetric
enzyme assay technology on chemistry analyzers. In addition, the predicate device
reports LDL-cholesterol, this device reports LDL-particle number. The predicate device
is for use by clinical laboratories on clinical chemistry analyzers. Specimens to be tested
with Lipoprofile are sent to Liposcience laboratories for measurement and analysis using
the manufacturer’s system.

L. Test Principle:
The test system involves measurement of the 400 MHz proton NMR spectrum of a plasma or
serum sample, deconvolution of the composite signal at ~0.8 ppm to produce the signal
amplitudes of the lipoprotein subclasses that contribute to the composite plasma signal, and
conversion of these subclass signal amplitudes to lipoprotein subclass concentrations. The 0.8
ppm plasma NMR signal arises from the methyl group protons of the lipids carried in the VLDL,
LDL, and HDL subclasses of varying diameter. The NMR signals from the various lipoprotein
subclasses have unique and distinctive frequencies and lineshapes, each of which are accounted
for in the deconvolution analysis model. LDL subclass particle concentrations, in units of
nanomoles of particles per liter (nmol/L), are summed to give the reported total LDL particle
concentration (LDL-P). By employing conversion factors that assume that the various
lipoprotein subclass particles have cholesterol and triglyceride contents characteristic of
normolipidemic individuals, HDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations are also derived.

Triglycerides: 5-1100 mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
TMA (Trimethylacetic acid, Sodium salt) is used as the NMR calibrator for the NMR
clinical analyzers. TMA is used routinely as a calibrator once daily during instrument
startup to establish daily normalization factors. It also serves as a quality assessment tool
to ensure quality NMR spectra are produced by the NMR analyzer. New calibrator
material is run in parallel with the existing calibrator in five separate runs.
The stability of the TMA calibrator material and storage conditions was studied over an
18-month period. The TMA calibrator was stored at room temperature and at 4 deg C, in
both plastic vials and glass bottles. Aliquots were taken and TMA signal methyl integrals
were measured once every two months during the 18 month study period. There were no
significant changes in the integral of the stored TMA material during the study period for
the different storage conditions. The coefficient of variation over the study period (where

measurements were made in 6 different NMR analyzers) for the TMA integrals were less
than 1%.
Control material consists of human serum at two levels (A and B). To assign values, new
controls are run on every available NMR clinical analyzer in-house during a two week
period in parallel with the then existing controls. Means, Standard Deviations and %CVs
are computed and new targets are established.
Stability for control material over 17 months was determined. The percents deviation, of
observed mean values relative to the target mean values, for control materials across
multiple NMR analyzers were under 5%.
d. Detection limit:
Serial dilutions of sample pools as well as a blank solution (NMR diluent) were run on 10
different instruments, two times each per instrument to collect 20 data points. Data were
compiled and analyzed to determine bias and %CV for each dilution.
The lower limits of the reportable range, defined by the limits of detection, are: LDL-P:
300-nmol/L; HDL-C: 7 mg/dL , Triglycerides: 5 mg/dL.
The limits of quantitation, determined to achieve total error < 20%, are: LDL-P: 300-
nmol/L; HDL-C: 10 mg/dL , Triglycerides: 25 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Twenty drugs representing classes of five major categories of medications that are likely
to be taken by the target population were selected and evaluated for their possible
interference with the NMR assay. Pure drugs were purchased and prepared in solutions
which were spiked into 6 different pools of plasma samples to attain levels similar to the
highest possible blood concentrations as shown in the following table. Mean percent
differences for each substance were <5%.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
HDL-C and triglycerides were evaluated by split sample comparison to the predicate
devices. Samples were from apparently healthy men and women, ages ranging from 44-
84 (mean 61). Points on the plot, as well as calculations of correlation coefficients and
standard errors are based on singlicate measurements. The HDL-C analysis includes
5362 plasma samples with values ranging from 15 to 140 mg/dL. The triglyceride
analysis includes the same 5362 samples with triglyceride values ranging from 21 to 400
mg/dL.

b. Matrix comparison:
The various specimen tubes recommended by the manufacturer for use with this assay are
serum drawn in gel barrier NMR LipoTubes (Greiner, Inc. Part #456293), or red-top
collection tubes; or plasma drawn into EDTA or heparin collection tubes. Three studies
were conducted to validate the equivalence of NMR LipoProfile results using these serum
and plasma specimens. In all 3 studies, blood was collected in the specified collection
tubes, centrifuged within 1 hour, and immediately tested. The study comparing serum
(red-top) to EDTA plasma tested individual specimens from 38 volunteers, the study
comparing serum (red-top) to serum (NMR LipoTube) tested individual specimens from
20 volunteers, and the study comparing serum (NMR LipoTube) to heparin plasma tested
individual specimens from 35 volunteers. Samples tested spanned most of the assay
range. Average biases observed were less than 5% for triglycerides and HDL-C, and

See section c, below for clinical study descriptions.
b. Clinical specificity:
See section c, below for clinical study descriptions.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Since there is not a predicate device that measures LDL-P, descriptions and results of 3
clinical studies were provided. (Literature references for these studies are listed in the
product package insert).
Study 1
Samples from the nested case-controlled EPIC study (the European prospective
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) were evaluated. The study population included
men and women, inhabitants of Norfolk, UK, aged 45-79 years. Non-fasting serum
samples were collected at the beginning of the study (baseline). Participants were
followed for 6 years for the development of CAD, defined as CAD death, MI and angina.
The samples tested by the Lipoprofile assay were from cases (n=1003) who developed
CAD during the 6 year follow-up period and controls (n=1885) matched for age, gender,
and enrollment time who did not develop CAD. None of the cases or controls were
taking any lipid altering medication.
Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for future (incident)
CAD, adjusted for smoking and blood pressure. Odds ratios for development of CAD by
quartiles are shown in the table below.

Study 2:
Samples from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial were evaluated by
the Lipoprofile assay. Participants in the study were apparently-healthy female
health-care professionals, aged 45 years and older, who were free of self-reported
CVD. Evaluations were conducted on 27,673 baseline non-fasting EDTA plasma
samples from participants. During the study participants were followed for incident
CVD, which included non-fatal MI, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary
artery bypass grafting, non-fatal ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular death. Over the
(mean) follow-up period of 11 years, 1015 CVD events occurred. Odds ratios
associated with quartiles for LDL-P observed in this study are shown below.

plasma samples were collected at baseline and after 7 months from men younger than
74 years (mean age 64.2) with an established diagnosis of CHD and low levels of
LDL-C and HDL-C. Case subjects were men who experienced a CHD event (cardiac
death or non-fatal MI) during the mean 5.1 year follow-up period. Control subjects
were men matched for age who remained free of CHD events during follow-up.
There were 354 CVD events and 697 age-matched controls. Samples from these
individuals were evaluated as described below.
Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the associations of CHD events with
concentrations of LDL-P measured at baseline and during the trial (7 month time
point), adjusted for non-lipid covariates. The table below shows odds ratios for a new
CHD event associated with a 1-standard deviation (SD) increment of LDL-P in the
subjects treated with placebo (n=546).
4. Clinical cut-off:
See expected values, below.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
In order to determine the distribution of LDL-P levels expected in a representative sampling
of the general population, plasma samples (n=5,362) were analyzed from apparently healthy
men and women (mean age 61, ranging from 44 to 84 years) enrolled in the Multi-Ethnic
Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large epidemiologic study sponsored by the National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This reference population consisted of men (n=2,529) and
women (2,833) with the following ethnic make-up: 1467 African-American (27.4%); 2039
Caucasian (38.0%); 658 Chinese (12.3%); and 1198 Hispanic (22.3%). The following table

3. Specimen Identification:
Bar code of source tube
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The NMR Profiler is interfaced with a sample handler. Samples are manually placed in
the sample handler rack, in the same sequence as bar coded source tubes. Source tubes
are sequentially scanned by the Liposcience laboratory technician. This information is
stored in the database and in a file required as input to the NMR Profiler. Each spectrum
is stored in the file system in a manner that preserves the identity of the sample from
which the spectrum was collected.
5. Calibration:
The instrument is calibrated with an aqueous solution of Trimethyl Acetate (TMA) a a
disodium salt (15.0 mM) containing Na EDTA (5.0 mM), CaCl (3.0 mM) KCl (120
