L. Test Principle:
The Total Bilirubin 2 assay is based on a vanadate oxidation method. Total bilirubin
(conjugated and unconjugated) is oxidized by vanadate at about pH 2.9 to produce
biliverdin. In the presence of detergent and vanadate, both conjugated and
unconjugated bilirubin are oxidized. The oxidation reaction causes a decrease in the
optical density which is proportional to the total bilirubin concentration in the sample.
The concentration is measured as an endpoint reaction.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run and total imprecision were evaluated on each chemistry platform
by testing five levels of serum pools. Each sample was assayed two times per
run, 1 or 2 runs per day for at least 10 days. Precision estimates were
computed according to CLSI EP5-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of
Quantitative Measurement Methods. The results are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Nine equally spaced levels of serum pools prepared using high and low
linearity pools were tested on the ADVIA 1200, 1650, and 2400 platforms.
The sample concentrations tested ranged from approximately 0.17 mg/dL to
37.5 mg/dL. All results were within ± 5% of the expected value except the
lowest dilution level which had concentrations approaching the limits of
detection of the assay. The results of the lowest dilution level were all with ±

0.03 mg/dL of the expected value. The reportable range for all platforms is
0.1 mg/dL to 35 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor states that the calibrators are traceable to the AACC reference
method, which used reference materials from NIST, via patient correlation.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed for reagent stability. The
reagents are stable until their expiration dates when stored as instructed.
Calibrators were previously cleared under k030169 and controls under
k883209.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection and the limit of the blank were determined as outlined
in CLSI EP17-A. A blank sample (saline) was evaluated 64 times on each
platform to calculate the limit of the blank. A low level sample was also run
64 times on each platform and used to calculate the limit of detection. The
observed limits of detection on the three platforms were all below the claimed
low end of the measuring range of the assay (0.1 mg/dL).
e. Analytical specificity:
The interference study was carried out in the presence of approximately 1
mg/dL and 20 mg/dL total bilirubin. The samples were evaluated on the
ADVIA 1200, 1650, and 2400. All samples were evaluated in duplicate with
multiple concentrations of each interferant. Lack of interference was defined
as a bias of <10% compared to a sample without the interfering substance
present. The assay showed no interference with up to 50 mg/dL ascorbic acid,
1000 mg/dL hemoglobin, and 1000 mg/dL triglycerides.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Correlation studies were performed by first comparing adult patient samples
on the ADVIA 1650 to the ADVIA IMS predicate device. The same adult
patient samples were then measured on the ADVIA 1200 and ADVIA 2400
and compared to the ADVIA 1650. The studies were performed over 5 days
and the results are summarized below.
