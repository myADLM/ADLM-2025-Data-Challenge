Detection and Quantitation: Approve Guideline-2004
6. FDA guidance document, Guidance for 510(k)s on Cholesterol Tests for Clinical
Laboratory, Physicians’ Office Laboratory and Home Use-1995
7. American Society for Testing and Materials methodology for accelerated aging of medical
devices (ASTM F1980)
8. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection,
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel
III), NIH, May 2001
L. Test Principle:
The lay user follows the directions to self-collect a capillary blood sample
(approximately 100 micro liters), package and mail the sample to the Home Access Health
Corporation. Once the dried sample is received in the laboratory, it is eluted into a usable
serum sample. Once eluted, the sample can be assayed as a diluted serum sample using FDA-
cleared reagents. All testing is done using the Roche Cobas Mira Plus analyzer for total
cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides. The LDL-cholesterol was calculated using
the Friedewald formula.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Cholesterol was certified by the Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory Network
(CRMLN) as meeting the National Cholesterol Program’s (NCEP) performance criteria
for accuracy and precision.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed based on the CLSI EP5-A guideline and NCEP
guidelines for accuracy. Two volunteers were chosen as a sample source as their
lipoprotein levels were closed to “high” and “low” medical decision levels. Their
blood was drawn and spotted onto the 240 blood collection cassettes (micro serum
samples, MSS). These MSS samples are allowed to dry, then eluted, and measured
on the Roche Cobas Mira analyzer for total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and
Triglycerides. All samples were tested twice a day in duplicate for 20 days (N=80).
The precision results are shown below:

For accuracy based on the NCEP guideline’s allowable precision, bias, and total %
error, the results of the micro serum samples (MSS) are shown in the table below:

Triglycerides 305 4.39 -1.47 9.94 <14.8
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed to validate a linear range of lipid profile testing in
micro serum samples (MSS) according to the CLSI EP6-A guideline. Lipid profile
testing includes testing of three analytes: Total Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol, and
Triglycerides. A pair of blood specimens was chosen for each analyte based on high
and low levels of each lipoprotein. These specimens were then mixed in different
proportions and spotted onto blood collection /transportation cassettes (MSS
samples). These MSS samples were then eluted and measured, and their MSS results
calculated and compared to the expected plasma values (blood drawn by
venipuncture). A total of 11 sets of MSS with different levels were tested in
replicates of 4. MSS values were plotted against the expected values and an
appropriate line fitted by standard linear regression yielded the following:
For Total Cholesterol: Y= 0.9648 + 11.26, r2=0.9943, sample ranges tested was 82-
564 mg/dL.
For HDL Cholesterol: Y= 0.987 + 1.088, r2=0.9982, sample ranges tested was 10-
151 mg/dL.
For Triglyceride: Y= 0.9860 – 1.03, r2=0.9986, sample ranges tested was 16-1015
mg/dL.
The sponsor chose the following as their device’s linearity ranges: 82-500 mg/dL for
total cholesterol, 23-151 mg/dL for HDL-cholesterol and 16-900 mg/dL for
Triglycerides.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Home Access Health Corp. has documented traceability to the NCEP’s recommended
accuracy base for Total Cholesterol by performing a direct comparison with a

Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory Network laboratory using fresh human
specimens which cover the NCEP medical decision points.
Shelf-life of the blood collection cassette was determined by an accelerated aging study
according to the ASTM F1980 document. The sponsor concluded that the blood
collection cassette has a shelf-life of 36 months. Sample stability study was conducted
by collecting capillary whole blood samples on the collection cassettes and stored at
room temperature for 21 days. The acceptance criteria are: the % bias between the
control condition and the tested conditions must meet the NCEP acceptance criteria of
bias of <3% for cholesterol, <5% for HDL and <5% for triglyceride. Results indicated
that the micro serum samples are stable up to 21 days at room temperature.
In addition, a shipping study consisting of spotted dry samples shipped in presumably
worst-case real-time shipping conditions, during the hottest month of the year, August,
from south (Florida) and southwest (California) locations of the continental USA was
conducted and the results showed acceptable stability according to the NCEP
acceptance criteria for bias.
Furthermore, a sample stability study that challenge between the extreme temperatures
(45 oC and -20oC) was conducted to simulate the worst case scenario, consists of
samples stressed at 45oC, then thawed and frozen at -20oC for two and half days was
performed. The results also showed acceptable stability according to the NCEP
acceptance criteria for bias.
d. Detection limit:
A detection limit study was performed to assess the detection limits of the micro
serum samples for total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides based on
CLSI EP-17A guideline. Limit of Blank (LoB) is determined by using the simulated
blood samples: washed red blood cells from 4 different donors mixed with an
osmotically balanced salt solution. Limit of Detection (LoD) was conducted by
running a sample with concentration up to 4 times the LoB. Testing was done 10
times a day for 3 days on two analyzers (N=60). The calculated limit of detection for
total cholesterol is 29 mg/dL, HDL-cholesterol is 11 mg/dL, and triglycerides is 4
mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was conducted to determine the effect of common interference
substances based on the CLSI EP7-A guidelines. Two levels (around medical
decisions points) of total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides were tested. Blood
samples were draw from volunteers and split into two pools: one pool was used as the
control blood and the other pool was used to spike with different levels of
interferents. The following interference substances were tested: bilirubin,
hemoglobin, ascorbic acid, and triglycerides. Stock solutions of the above chemicals
were prepared and spiked into the tested pool sample with different concentrations.
8

--- Page 9 ---
The % bias was calculated based on the differences between the spiked sample and
the control sample. Results of the interference studies of various potential
interferents were shown as follows:
For the total cholesterol assay:
Bilirubin: Interference ≤ 3% for up to 17.4 mg/dL bilirubin
Hemolysis: Interference ≤ 3% for up to 500 mg/L hemoglobin (The sponsor states
that the lab will visually inspect all specimens and reject any that are hemolyzed.)
Ascorbic acid: Interference ≤ 7% for up to 6 g/L ascorbic acid
For the HDL-cholesterol assay:
Bilirubin: Interference ≤ 5% for up to 42.3 mg/dL bilirubin
Hemolysis: Interference ≤ 5% for up to 500 mg/L hemoglobin
Triglyceride: Interference ≤ 5% for up to 625 mg/L Triglycerides
Ascorbic acid: Interference ≤ 5% for up to 6 g/L ascorbic acid
For the Triglycerides assay:
Bilirubin: Interference ≤ 5% for up to 17.4 mg/dL bilirubin
Hemolysis: Interference ≤ 5% for up to 500 mg/L hemoglobin
Ascorbic acid: Interference ≤ 10% for up to 6 g/L ascorbic acid
A hematocrit study was conducted based on the CLSI EP7-A guideline. For each
analyte, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides, two volunteer donors
were drawn. The venous blood was drawn and spun down to separate red blood cells
and plasma. Then the blood cells were mixed back with plasma to reach 35% (low),
45% (control) and 55% (high) hematocrits. The blood specimens with these 3
hematocrits were spotted onto 28 collection cassettes each, dried and packaged
according to the package insert. Micro serum samples results for the low and high
hematocrits were compared to the control group. The difference between the tested
hematocrits (35% and 55%) and the control hematocrit (45%) was calculated and the
allowable bias difference was based on the NCEP guidelines for each analyte. All the
results met the NCEP % bias criteria (criteria: cholesterol is <3%, HDL is <5%, and
Triglyceride is <5%). The sponsor concluded that hematocrit range at 35% to 55% do
not interfere with any of the measured lipoproteins.

--- Page 10 ---
A method comparison study was conducted based on the CLSI EP9-A2 guideline.
The study was performed to compare test results obtained by the lay user’s finger-
stick samples with the test results by the venous samples using the Roche Cobas Mira
analyzer in the clinical laboratory of the Home Access Health Corporation (HAHC).
Blood samples were collected by lay user at a clinic and mailed to HAHC for
analysis. In addition, professionally collected finger-stick samples were also
collected and mailed at the same time. Results of the standard linear regressions were
shown below:
Between the lay user’s finger-stick and the venous samples:
For total cholesterol: Y= 1.016X-4.4, r2=0.9836, N=151, sample range was 127-
467 mg/dL
For HDL-cholesterol: Y= 0.9937X-0.904, r2=0.9639, N=137, sample range was 22-
141 mg/dL
For triglycerides: Y=0.9798X+7.8, r2= 0.9771, N=141, sample range was 33-591
mg/dL
Between the professional-collected finger-stick and the venous samples:
For total cholesterol: Y= 0.9863X + 7.486, r2=0.9814, N=155, sample range was 127-
467 mg/dL
For HDL-cholesterol: Y=1.008X + 0.5872, r2=0.9581, N=142, sample range was 22-
141 mg/dL
For triglycerides: Y= 0.9788X + 9.70, r2= 0.9777, N=147, sample range was 33-875
mg/dL
Between the lay user’s finger-stick and the professional’s finger-stick:
For total cholesterol: Y= 1.003X – 5.4, r2=0.9195, N=111, sample range was 127-316
mg/dL
For HDL-cholesterol: Y=0.931X - 1.34, r2=0.9049, N=110, sample range was 22-129
mg/dL
For triglycerides: Y= 0.9599X + 4.016, r2= 0.9283, N=107, sample range was 33-506
mg/dL
Approximately 93% of the home users were able to successfully self-collect a dried
capillary sample while the professionals’ success rate is 92%. In addition, some
samples are hemolyzed and cannot be used for analysis; therefore, the sponsor has put
a warning statement in their package insert as follows: “Avoid excessive squeezing
10

or milking of the finger”. The sponsor claims that the laboratory will visually inspect
all samples and reject those that are hemolyzed.
