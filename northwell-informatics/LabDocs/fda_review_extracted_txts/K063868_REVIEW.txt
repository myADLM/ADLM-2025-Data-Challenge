L. Test Principle:
LC/MS/MS utilizes three dimensions of separation/selection for the target analyte prior
to the detection step.
1. A chromatographic dimension in which the selection is based on the ability
to separate the target analyte from interferences under the conditions of the
separation;
2. A primary mass separation, MS 1, in which the selection is based on the
molecular mass of the target analyte. The sample for the mass-based
separation is a defined retention window from the chromatography selected
to specifically to eliminate interferences; and
3. A secondary mass separation, MS 2, which occurs after the target mass
window from the primary mass separation is subjected to conditions to
fragment the target analyte. The secondary mass separation is then
performed on the fragments from the primary mass separation target mass
window. The signal for measurement is then obtained from the mass
window known to contain the analyte fragment target mass again to
specifically eliminate interferences.
In a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer, (MS/MS) the mass windows described
above are typically 1.0 – 1.5 Da (atomic mass units) in width and therefore provide
highly selective filters for the analytes of interest.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

--- Page 5 ---
The sponsor evaluated precision at three external sites by assaying three levels
of tacrolimus according to CLSI EP5-A2. Samples were prepared by spiking
tacrolimus into pooled patient whole blood. Concentrations were chosen to
represent the middle of the reportable range and the low and high medical
decision points. Each level was analyzed in duplicate, twice per day over 20
days (n = 80). Results were as follows:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was assessed at two sites according to both CLSI EP-6 and EP-6A.
The latter document utilizes polynomial regression analysis to assess whether
the data set is statistically non-linear. Using this method, none of the second or
third order coefficients were significantly different from zero at the 95%
confidence level, indicating that the data are linear. EP-6 assesses linearity
using lack-of-fit modeling. According to this assessment the data were also

The sponsor also assessed recovery of the assay at one site by spiking tacrolimus into six
whole blood samples. Each sample had an initial tacrolimus concentration of 5 – 10 ng/mL
which was measured prior to spiking. Aliquots of each of the six samples were then spiked
with an additional 5, 10, and 20 ng/mL Tacrolimus (n = 18). Target values were calculated
for each aliquot as (initial concentration + amount of spike). Each of the 18 samples were
analyzed in triplicate. Recovery study results are summarized in the following table:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods)
Although the use of fresh samples is recommended, the sponsor has made the
following claims for sample stability in the labeling:
o Room temperature (22° C) for 24 hours
o Refrigerator temperature (4° C) for 7 days
o Frozen (-20° C) for 60 days and stable through three freeze/thaw cycles
These claims were validated by the sponsor’s sample stability testing protocol
Calibrators, controls, and internal standard are prepared by spiking tacrolimus
into tacrolimus-free whole blood. Samples are then freeze-dried, reconstituted
and assayed as unknowns by seven different laboratories using validated
Tacrolimus methods to assign values to a master lot. Production lots are
traceable to the master lot. The sponsor states that there are currently no
recognized reference standards for tacrolimus.
Calibrator and control stability dating is established by assessing kit recovery at
various time points. Frozen proficiency testing samples are thawed, analyzed,
and compared to the peer group mean. The sponsor’s results were within ±
10% of the peer group mean.
d. Detection limit:
The lower limit of quantification (LLoQ) was determined using CLSI EP-17A
as a guide. Twelve clinical samples were selected for analysis ranging in
concentration from 0.125 to 0.6 ng/mL. Each of the samples was analyzed on
four different days with four replicate injections of each sample (n=16). The
LLoQ was defined as the lowest concentration where the CV<20% with <20%
deviation from the expected concentration. Samples at a concentration of 0.5
ng/mL (the sponsor’s claimed LOQ) met these criteria.
e. Analytical specificity:
Potential interferences due to the following substances or conditions were
evaluated using CLSI EP7-A as a guide:
Potential Interferent Maximum Concentration
Anticoagulants
K EDTA 9.0 mg/mL (5 X normal)
2
Endogenous Substances
Hematocrit 15 – 60%
Bilirubin 60 mg/dL
Albumin 12 g/dL

A base pool of ≈20 ng/mL tacrolimus was first analyzed for tacrolimus as the control
concentration. Each substance at the concentration in the list above was then added to an
aliquot of the base pool and reanalyzed for tacrolimus. All of the compounds tested caused
a change in tacrolimus concentration of ≤ ±10% from the control concentration.
Potential interferents with a molecular mass of < 750 Daltons were excluded from testing
because they would not reasonably be expected to cause interference with this LC-MS-MS
method due to the difference in mass between the potential interferent and the target
analyte. .
The identities of three known metabolites are 12-hydroxy-Tacrolimus, demethyl-
Tacrolimus (13-0, 15-0 and 31-0) and 13, 31-0-didemethyl-Tacrolimus. Five clinical
samples with Tacrolimus levels > 20 ng/mL were reanalyzed according to a standard
curve with quality control materials. An instrument method was created to record
transitions from masses of the precursor ammonium adducts to the respective product
daughter ions for the individual metabolites at m/z 793.5>740.4 (didemethyl), m/z
807.5>754.4 (demethyl), m/z 809.5>756.4 (ascomycin - internal standard), m/z
821.5>768.4 (Tacrolimus) and m/z 837.5>786.4 (hydroxy), as per tuning with
Tacrolimus and ascomycin.
Comparison of the traces of the different transitions showed that there was no evidence of
any m/z 793.5>740.4, m/z 807.5>754.4 or m/z 837.5>786.4 products in the standard curve
or quality control materials. However, all five clinical samples exhibited one or more peaks
in the m/z 807.5>754.4 channel at 0.80, and 0.80 and 1.10 minutes in the m/z 809.5>756.4
channel (Tacrolimus and ascomycin elute at 0.90 minutes). The maximum intensity of the
demethyl-metabolite peaks was about one factor of ten lower than the Tacrolimus peak.
There was no evidence of the 12-hydroxy- or the 13, 31-O-didemethylmetabolites.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
No firm therapeutic range exists for tacrolimus in whole blood. The optimum
therapeutic range of tacrolimus used in each institution relies on factors that pertain
to the needs of its patient population and the specific assay used. The complexity of
the clinical state, individual differences in sensitivity to immunosuppressive and
nephrotoxic effects of tacrolimus, co-administration of other immunosuppressants,
type of transplant, time post-transplant, and several other factors also contribute to
different requirements for optimal blood levels of tacrolimus. Furthermore, the
wide variety of parameters leading to optimal tacrolimus therapy on an individual
basis means that tacrolimus measurements alone cannot be used as an indication
for changing treatment regimens. Each patient should be thoroughly evaluated
clinically before changes in treatment regimens are made.
It should be noted that LC/MS/MS target ranges may be lower than immunoassay
ranges, owing to the lack of metabolite cross-reactivity.
