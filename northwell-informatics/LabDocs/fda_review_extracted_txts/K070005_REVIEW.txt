510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
ASSAY ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
K070005
B. Purpose for Submission:
To seek clearance for HemosIL RecombiPlasTin 2G
HemosIL RecombiPlasTin 2G is modified from the current PT reagent HemosIL
RecombiPlasTin (K043184). The ratio of raw material phospholipids used in the
current PT reagent is modified to address the assay’s labeled sensitivity to the
recently released antibiotic CUBICIN (Daptomycin for injection).

• Fibrinogen
D. Type of Test:
Absorbance or light-scatter clot detection
E. Applicant:

4. Panel:

H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
HemosIL RecombiPlasTin 2G is a high sensitivity thromboplastin reagent based
on recombinant human tissue factor (RTF) for the quantitative determination in
human citrated plasma of Prothrombin Time (PT) on IL Coagulation and
ELECTRA Systems and Fibrinogen on IL Coagulation Systems only. The
product is used for the evaluation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway and the
monitoring of Oral Anticoagulant Therapy (OAT).
2. Indication(s) for use:
HemosIL RecombiPlasTin 2G is a high sensitivity thromboplastin reagent based
on recombinant human tissue factor (RTF) for the quantitative determination in
human citrated plasma of Prothrombin Time (PT) on IL Coagulation and
ELECTRA Systems and Fibrinogen on IL Coagulation Systems only. The
product is used for the evaluation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway and the
monitoring of Oral Anticoagulant Therapy (OAT).
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
4. Special instrument requirements:
• PT on IL Coagulation and ELECTRA Systems
• Fibrinogen on IL Coagulation Systems only
I. Device Description:
The RecombiPlasTin 2G reagent is formulated to be insensitive to therapeutic levels
of heparin. In the PT test, the addition of the tissue thromboplastin (RecombiPlasTin
2G reagent) to the patient plasma in the presence of calcium ions initiates the
activation of the extrinsic pathway. This results ultimately in the conversion of
fibrinogen to fibrin, with formation of a solid gel. For the IL Coagulation Systems
only, the Fibrinogen is quantitated (PT-based method) by relating the absorbance or
light-scatter during clotting to a calibrator.

acceptance criteria for validating their claims.
d. Detection limit:
e. Analytical specificity:
• CUBICIN (Daptomycin for injection)
The sponsor provided the justification for the use of plasma spiking
studies to test for CUBICIN (Daptomycin for injection) interference; the
expected peak dosing for CUBICIN in circulation blood is 75µg/mL. The
interference study was performed on representative members of the IL
Coagulation system families using the following specifications:
o Normal sample ± 1 second from unspiked sample
o Coumadin sample ± 10% recovery of the unspiked sample
The study met the specifications and indicated no clinically significant
CUBICIN dose response with the modified HemosIL RecombiPlasTin 2G.
• Heparin, hemoglobin, triglycerides, and bilirubin
Interference study results met the acceptance criteria for validating their
claims.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
• In-house Study:
A method comparison study was performed to compare the performance
of the modified HemosIL RecombiPlasTin 2G vs. the predicate HemosIL
RecombiPlasTin on representative members of the different IL
Coagulation System Families.
198 citrated frozen plasma samples were used in the study, 130 normal
donors and 68 abnormal patient samples. Abnormal patient samples
include: OAT, Lupus, liver disease, low fibrinogen, high fibrinogen, un-
fractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, DIC, factor II
deficient, factor V deficient, factor VII deficient, factor X deficient.

One sample result was removed from calculations due to instrument’s
error. A single sample outlier was also removed from calculations due to
severe factor VII deficient concentration. The removal of these two
results brings their total to N=196.

the ACL 6000 as the reference device, were performed to demonstrate
instrument equivalency.
The product insert provides a statement indicating that customers can
expect to see a discrepancy in slopes for PT seconds when comparing
reagents with different ISI assignments.
• Field Site Study:
The following IL coagulation instruments were grouped as instrument
equivalency:
o Linear Analyzer Group: ACL TOP, ACL Advance/Futura, and
ELECTRA Series
o Centrifugal Analyzer Group: ACL 8/9/10000/Elite/ElitePro, ACL
100-7000 Series
- First field site study:
PT seconds, INR and Fibrinogen method comparison study was performed
on an ACL TOP representing the linear analyzer group. 207 patient
samples were used in this study. The patient samples included 119 normal
samples and 88 abnormal samples, including 61 patients on OAT and 27
patients with various disease states.
For Fibrinogen, thirteen samples were not included in the calculations due
to no available results from either the reference or test instrument, N=194.

The product insert advises customers that “These results were obtained using
a specific lot of reagent. Due to many variables which may affect clotting
times, each laboratory should establish its own normal range.”
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
