H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Refer to the Indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Phamatech At Home 12 Drug Test: Models 9308T and 9308Z for
amphetamines (AMP), barbiturates (BAR), benzodiazepines (BZD), cocaine
(COC), ecstasy (MDMA), methadone (MTD), methamphetamine (MET), opiates
(OPI), oxycodone (OXY), phencyclidine (PCP) and marijuana (THC) is a
screening test for the rapid detection of the drugs listed above in urine. The cut-
1

--- Page 2 ---
off concentrations (ng/ml) for these drugs are as follows: amphetamines (1000),
barbiturates (200), benzodiazepines (200), cocaine (300), ecstasy (500),
methadone (300), methamphetamine (500), opiates (300), oxycodone (100),
phencyclidine (25) and marijuana (50).
The BAR, BZD and OXY assay will yield preliminary positive results when these
drugs are ingested at or above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly
recognized drug levels for barbiturates, benzodiazepines or oxycodone in urine.
This test only identifies the presence of these drugs when present at or above the
stated cut-off concentration.
This assay provides only a preliminary test result. A more specific alternate
analytical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result.
Gas chromatography / Mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory
test method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied
to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are
indicated.
This device is not for professional or workplace testing. It is intended for Home
Use.
This device is intended for over-the-counter (OTC) consumer use as the first step
in a two step process to provide consumers with information concerning the
presence or absence of the above stated drugs / drug metabolites in urine.
Information regarding confirmation testing – the second step in the process, along
with materials for shipping urine samples to the laboratory, are included.

4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable.
I. Device Description:
The At Home Drug Test 12 Model 9308Z is a single use device utilizing a cup
format. The user collects urine in the cup to the recommended volume and fills the
labeled vial to two-thirds full. The reaction is initiated by movement of the sample
through the test strip. Test strips are incorporated into the sides of a sample cup. The
kit includes the following materials: 1 instructional booklet, 1 urine collection cup, 1
labeled vial, 1 plastic pouch with absorbent pad, 1 pre-addressed mailer box and 1
personal identification label.
The At Home Drug Test 12 Model 9308T is a single use dip card device. The user
inserts the absorbent end of the device in the urine sample to the maximum level
indicated by the line on the device label. The test reaction is initiated by movement of
the sample through the test strip. The kit includes the following materials: 1
instructional booklet, 1 urine collection cup, 1 labeled vial, 1 plastic pouch with
absorbent pad, 1 pre-addressed mailer box and 1 personal identification label.
The At Home Drug Test 12 devices detect up to twelve drugs of abuse. The table
presented below lists the drugs of abuse that were previously cleared for OTC use, the
510(k) number they were cleared under and the device format (card or cup).

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The tests employ lateral flow immunochromatographic technology, which
involves the recognition and formation of a specific antibody/target drug
complex. Drug in the sample and drug-labeled conjugate compete for antibody
binding sites. Absence of a line in the test area is a presumptive positive result,
and the presence of a line in the test area is a negative result. The control line (C)
serves as an internal quality control to ensure proper sample volume has been added
to the test and that the sample has correctly migrated up the test strip.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Three consumer studies were conducted to determine the device’s
performance when used by untrained users following the instructions in the
labeling. Note: Study number three was performed only with sample solutions
containing oxycodone at two concentrations: approximately 67 ng/mL and
approximately 109 ng/mL. A questionnaire was used to determine if the
untrained users understood the test instructions and the meaning of the results.
Consumers were asked if they understood the best time to collect a sample,
the directions for collecting a urine sample, performing the test and
interpreting the test result. 180 consumers interpreted a total of 1,874 tests and
98% (1,844 of 1,874) were interpreted correctly. Approximately 50% of the
participants were female and 50% were male ranging in age from18 to >60
years of age. Approximately 25 of 180 had less than 12 years of education,
approximately 42 of 180 were high school graduates, and approximately 109
of 180 had attended college or graduated from college. There was no
5

--- Page 6 ---
information on the educational background of approximately four consumers.
Study #1
109 consumers performed the tests using high clinical samples diluted in
normal drug-free urine. Some samples contained as many as ten drugs; there
were combinations that contained no drugs at all. Drug concentrations were
confirmed by GC/MS. Consumers tested even numbered samples on the test
cup device and odd numbered samples on the test card device. Each of the
new drugs intended for OTC use, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, methadone
and oxycodone, were tested at 0%, 50%, 75%, 125%, and 150% of the target
concentration. The drugs previously cleared for OTC use, amphetamines,
cocaine, methamphetamines, opiates, PCP, and THC were tested at various
cutoff concentrations ranging from 0% to 150% of the target concentrations.
1,073 of 1,081 interpretations made by lay users were correct (99%). At 75%
of the cutoff, 99 of the 100 test interpretations were scored as correct. There
was one false positive for amphetamines. At ≤50% of the cutoff, 884 of the
891 test interpretations were scored as correct. There was 1 false positive for
benzodiazepine and THC, 2 false positives for opiates and 3 false positives for
PCP.
Study #2
760 unique tests with sample solutions containing amphetamines,
methamphetamines, cocaine, benzodiazepine, barbiturates, oxycodone,
methadone, opiates, THC and PCP were performed by 38 consumers using
drug-free urine that had been spiked with various concentrations and
combinations of drugs. Participants tested random coded samples with various
combinations of drugs at 75%, 125% and 150% of the target concentrations.
Drug concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS. Consumers performed the
assays using the test card format.
750 of 760 interpretations (98%) made by lay users were correct. At 75% of
cut-off, 229 of 235 interpretations were scored as correct results. There were 6
false positives for oxycodone; 1 false positive for benzodiazepines and 1 false
positive for cocaine. At 125% of cut-off 268 of 270 interpretations were
scored as correct results. There were 2 Invalid test results; i.e., control and/or
test line did not develop. At 150% of cut-off 253 of 255 interpretations were
scored as correct results. There was 1 false negative for PCP and 1 false
negative for THC.
Study #3
Sample solutions containing oxycodone were performed by thirty-three
consumers at two Phamatech locations. Thirty of the samples were clinical
samples diluted in drug-free urine to an approximate concentration of 67
ng/mL. Three positive samples were Oxycodone 200 ng/ml control diluted to
an approximate concentration of 109 ng/mL. Of the total thirty-three
6

--- Page 7 ---
interpretations made by lay users a total of 33 test results were correct.
Consumers performed the assays using the test card format.
A total of 1,874 tests were interpreted by lay users and 1,844 tests were
interpreted correctly. The sponsor pooled the results obtained by the test cup
and test card formats because these formats were demonstrated to be
equivalent in 510(k)s previously cleared for these analytes. The summary of
the results for Studies 1, 2 and 3 is presented in the tables below:
