L. Test Principle:
The EasyPlus mini Self Monitoring Blood Glucose System employs a disposable
dry reagent strip technology based on the glucose oxidase method for glucose
determination. Each test strip features an electrode containing the enzyme glucose
oxidase (Aspergillus niger). A blood sample is applied to the blood collection area at
the tip of the strip and is automatically drawn into the reaction zone, where the
glucose oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of glucose to produce gluconic acid. During
the reaction, a mediator transfers electrons to the electrode surface and generates a
current. The amount of the current is proportional to the amount of glucose present in
the blood sample. The glucose concentration is displayed on the meter screen after
5 seconds.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated within-day precision of the device using whole blood
samples spiked with six different glucose concentrations, two test strip lots
lots, and 10 different meters. Ten replicate glucose measurements were
tested for each concentration in one day. The results are summarized in the table
below.

Day-to-day precision was evaluated using three glucose controls with low, normal,
and high concentration levels over a ten-day period using ten meters and two test strip
lots. Each control was tested twice, once in the morning and once in the afternoon.
The results are summarized in the table below.

Normal 400 111 3.8 3.5
High 400 354 13.3 3.8
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The measuring range of the device is 20 - 600 mg/dL. Testing was performed using
whole blood supplemented with B-D-glucose to provide samples at seven different
blood glucose levels ranging from 15 to 628 mg/dL. The linearity study measured
spiked whole blood samples with the device using three test strip lots and the YSI
2300 analyzer. A total of 660 tests (220 x 3 lots) were performed on 5 meters. A
regression analysis showed linearity of the EasyPlus mini with a correlation
coefficient (r2) of 0.994 and with a regression equation y = 0.9997X -1.554.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The control solutions are prepared at two target concentrations by gravimetric
addition of glucose to an aqueous matrix. The glucose concentration of the control
solutions are verified with the YSI reference method. The glucose concentrations of
the control solutions are traceable to NIST SRM 917b8.
Shelf life studies show the unopened test strips have a 19 month life-span and 3
months shelf-life once a vial of strips is opened. Unopened controls have a 19 month
shelf life and are stable for 3 months after first use.
d. Detection limit:
The lower end of the measuring range is 20 mg/dL. See the linearity study above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Common interferences were evaluated by spiking venous blood with glucose to three
concentrations (approximately 50, 250 and 500 mg/dL). Each of these glucose
concentrations was then spiked with the interfering compound at two concentrations
to make the interference samples. Control samples were each spiked with the solvents
used to make the interfering samples. The substances and concentrations of the
interferents are recommended in CLSI EP7. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion for
the interference test was a bias ≤15 mg/dL when glucose concentration ≤75 mg/dL
and bias of ≤15% when glucose concentration >75 mg/dL. Interference from
dopamine and L-dopa was observed when the recommended concentration of these
drugs was reached in the blood. Interference was also observed in higher than
therapeutic dosages of acetaminophen, gentisic acid, and methyldopa.
No interference effects were observed from the common interfering compounds
shown below.

The sponsor evaluated the effect of hematocrit levels on whole blood samples spiked
with six hematocrit levels (approximately 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 55% and 60%) for
glucose values (4 levels) distributed within the measuring range (approximately 26 –
510 mg/dL) of the device. Each sample was run n=10 and the percent bias was
calculated compared to the 40% hematocrit samples. Results are summarized in the
table below. The claim for the device was for use with samples having hematocrit
concentrations ranging from 30% to 55%. The results of the hematocrit study are
summarized in the table below:

An altitude study was performed with venous whole blood adjusted to nine different
glucose concentrations ranging from approximately 26 to 568 mg/dL. One aliquot of
each sample was tested on the ground at 160 feet above sea level and the other was
tested at 10,000 feet. The result of each sample tested at 10,000 feet was within ±15%
of the YSI value. This demonstrates that the meter may be used up to an altitude of
10,000 feet above sea level.

Temperature and humidity studies were performed and showed that the meter can be
used at temperatures from 50°F to 104°F and at relative humidity ranging from 38%
to 93%.
A sample volume study was performed with venous whole blood adjusted to two
glucose concentrations (approximately 150 mg/dL and 375 mg/dL) and verified on
the YSI analyzer. The tests were performed on five test strip lots. One aliquot of each
sample was tested using seven different sample volumes (0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0
and 1.5 uL.) The sponsor's acceptance criterion was that value of each sample tested
on the EasyPlus mini should be within +/- 10% of the YSI value. The studies showed
that test can be performed with a sample volume of 0.6 uL.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor demonstrated that the EasyPlus mini Blood Glucose Monitoring System
intended for use with fingerstick samples is equivalent to the YSI 2300 Analyzer. 179
diabetics performed the test on the device at three clinics. A healthcare professional
then performed the test on the EasyPlus mini and the YSI 2300. The glucose values
for these samples ranged from 50.6 - 448 mg/dL. In order to fully cover the
measuring range, 20 samples were spiked with glucose or allowed to glycolyze. The
approximate percent distribution of 199 samples ranging from 21 to 600 mg/dL were
as follows: 20-50 mg/dL – 5%; 51-80 mg/dL – 6%; 81-120 mg/dL – 22%; 121-200
mg/dL – 35%; 201- 300 mg/dL – 21%; 301-400 – 5.5%; and 401-600 mg/dL –
5.5%. Based on data analysis, device met the minimum system accuracy requirement
established according to the ISO 15197 guidelines, which is 95% of the individual
glucose results falling within ±15 mg/dL of the results of the reference procedure at
glucose concentrations <75 mg/dL and within ± 20 % at glucose concentrations ≥75
mg/dL. These results are summarized in the table below.

3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip and
forearm. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip, there are no
special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
The meter automatically detects the code number when a test strip is inserted. The
labeling instructs the user to match the code number the meter displays to the code
9

--- Page 10 ---
number on the test vial. If the numbers do not match, or if no number appears, the user is
instructed to try another test strip. If this fails the user is instructed to try a new vial of
strips and to call customer service if this also fails.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at two different concentrations should be run with this device.
They are included in the device. When a test strip is inserted into the meter, the control
