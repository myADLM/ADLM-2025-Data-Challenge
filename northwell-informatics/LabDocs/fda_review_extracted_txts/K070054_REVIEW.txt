To evaluate the performance of the FIRST RESPONSE® Gold™ Digital
Pregnancy Test, five (5) replicate devices were tested with urine standards
prepared at 50, 37.5, 25, 18.8, 12.5, and 0 mIUmL hCG. All replicates tested
with hCG standards at 12.5 mIU/mL and above yielded positive results, and
all replicates tested with 0 mIU/mL hCG standard yielded negative results.
Performance was also evaluated with hyperglycosylated hCG prepared in
urine at 50, 37.5, 25, 18.8, 12.5, and 0 mIUmL concentrations. Five (5)
replicate devices were tested at each level. All replicates tested with
hyperglycosylated hCG standards at 12.5 mIU/mL and above yielded positive
results, and all replicates tested with 0 mIU/mL hCG standard yielded
negative results.
See Assay cut-off section below for a description of studies performed to
assess device performance in clinical samples at low hCG concentrations. e.
Analytical specificity:
Various drugs, urinary analytes, and homologous hormones were added to
aliquots of a female non-pregnant urine pool at hCG levels of 0 and 25
mIU/mL. All substances were tested at 10 μg/mL, except for albumin and
glucose (both at 20 mg/dL) and the homologous hormones (hFSH at 1 IU/mL,
hLH at 1 IU/mL, and hTSH at 1 mIU/mL). All samples produced positive
results at 25 mIU/mL of hCG and negative results at 0 mIU/mL of hCG.
f. Assay cut-off:
Early pregnancy clinical samples with hCG concentrations ranging from 5 to
20 mIU/mL were used to confirm the cut-off. Each urine sample was assigned
to a concentration interval, and the percentage of samples in each
concentration interval testing positive was calculated.

is approximately 9-10 mIU/mL.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Detection of hCG in Early Pregnancy Clinical Samples
To evaluate detection of hCG in early pregnancy clinical samples, the FIRST
RESPONSE® GOLD™ Digital Pregnancy Test was tested with
approximately 575 urine samples from 52 individual conceptive cycles. The
testing segment in each cycle commenced with the two consecutive negative
samples followed by the first sample demonstrating a rise in hCG collected
around the expected time of implantation, and the testing ended with the
sample collected 3 days after the expected menstrual period.
The results of this study demonstrate that the test can detect hCG (positive
samples were defined as samples with a quantitatively determined hCG value
> 18 mIU/mL) 4 days before the expected menstrual period. The following
percentages of cycles were positive for hCG before the expected menstrual
period: 58% 4 days before, 80% 3 days before, 90% 2 days before, and 94% 1
day before.
Incidence of Positives in Non-pregnant Women
A study was performed to determine the percentage of positive test results
from the FIRST RESPONSE® Gold™ Digital Pregnancy Test among non-
pregnant women 18-40 years of age (pre-menopausal), 41-55 years of age
(peri-menopausal), and 56-75 years of age (post-menopausal). A total of 272
subjects provided urine samples: 64 in the pre-menopausal cohort, 104 in the
peri-menopausal cohort, and 104 in the post-menopausal cohort. All 272 urine
samples were tested using two lots of the new device and quantitatively
analyzed for hCG level. Subjects with a positive test result on the new device
or hCG levels >5.00 mIU/mL were referred for clinical confirmation of
pregnancy (via pelvic exam and/or blood test).
Of the 272 urine samples, one sample that was positive on both lots was
excluded from the data analysis. The subject had a urinary hCG value of 17.50
mIU/mL and was subsequently confirmed as pregnant. This resulted in 63
subjects in the 18-40 age group and 271 total subjects/urine samples for data
analysis. The urine hCG concentrations were as follows:
Cohort Approx. Mean Conc. Concentration Range
Pre-menopausal 1 mIU/mL ≤ 1 mIU/mL
Peri-menopausal 2 mIU/mL ≤ 1 – 29 mIU/mL
Post-menopausal 2 mIU/mL ≤ 1 – 15 mIU/mL
Of the 271 samples tested (542 tests in total), there was only one positive
sample. This was observed in the peri-menopausal group. Both the pre- and
6

[Table 1 on page 6]
	Cohort		Approx. Mean Conc.	Concentration Range
Pre-menopausal			1 mIU/mL	≤ 1 mIU/mL
Peri-menopausal			2 mIU/mL	≤ 1 – 29 mIU/mL
Post-menopausal			2 mIU/mL	≤ 1 – 15 mIU/mL

--- Page 7 ---
post-menopausal groups showed 0% incidence of false positives by the new
device. Therefore, the incidence of false positive results by the FIRST
RESPONSE® Gold™ Digital Pregnancy Test was 0.18% for the total study
population.
Consumer Performance
Studies were performed to evaluate consumer self-testing and readability of
the package insert. One hundred and four (104) women between the ages of
18 and 45 years, untrained in laboratory testing, participated in the study.
Each woman performed the FIRST RESPONSE® Gold™ Digital Pregnancy
Test using the package insert instructions, including choosing either mid-
stream or dip procedure according to personal preference. After the consumer
read the result, the test result was also read by the study monitor.
All 104 women performed the test and interpreted their results correctly. Of
the 104 women, 97 obtained correct “-NO” results, 3 were clinically pregnant
and obtained correct “YES+” results, and 4 obtained invalid results due to
insufficient sample.
Another study was conducted in which 104 women between the ages of 18
and 45 years, untrained in laboratory testing, were given three pre-assayed test
devices and asked to read and interpret the test results from the display screen
using the package insert. The results from the three devices (YES+, -NO,
invalid) covered the range of results consumers could expect to obtain during
testing. The results of each device were also read by the study monitor.
Of the total of 312 results, 307 (98%) were read correctly. Both studies
demonstrate that consumers can accurately perform the test and read and
interpret results. This is also supported by results of the questionnaires which
addressed device ease of use, meaning of test results, and clarity of the
package insert instructions.
