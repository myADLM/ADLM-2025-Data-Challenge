2. Indication(s) for use:
Phamatech QuickScreen™ Barbiturates Test Models 9019, 9018
The QuickScreen Barbiturates Test is a qualitative in-vitro diagnostic screen that
provides a preliminary result for the detection/presence of barbiturates in urine.
Tests for barbiturates cannot distinguish between abused drugs and certain
prescribed medications. The cut-off concentration will be 300 ng/ml
(secobarbital). It is intended for professional use only.

QuickScreen™ Pro Multi Drug Screening Test is an in vitro diagnostic test for the
qualitative detection of amphetamine, cocaine, methamphetamine, opiates, PCP,
barbiturates, benzodiazepines, methadone and THC in urine. Tests for
prescription drugs cannot distinguish between abused drugs and certain prescribed
medications. Measurements obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis and
treatment of drug abuse. It is intended for professional use only.
Amphetamine 1000 ng/ml
Cocaine 300 ng/ml
Methamphetamine 1000 ng/ml
Opiates 2000 ng/ml

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
This test provides only a preliminary test result. A more specific alternate testing
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory
method. Other confirmation methods are available. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result,
particularly when preliminary positive results are observed.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable.
I. Device Description:
The single barbiturate test and multi drug test device employs lateral flow
immunochromatographic technology and is based on the principle of competitive
binding. The device is available in the cassette, dipstick and cup formats. Drugs, if
present in concentrations below the cutoff level, will not saturate the binding sites of
the antibody coated particles on the drug specific test strips. The goat-anti-rabbit IgG
antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-specific
conjugate. If the level of drug in the urine specimen is below the cutoff
concentration, the T line appears as a visible burgundy line. If the level of drug in the
urine specimen is above the cutoff, no T line develops. The control line (C line)
serves as an internal quality control of the system. It should always appear as a
burgundy-colored band regardless of the presence of the drug.

L. Test Principle:
The QuickScreenTM Barbiturate tests are chromatographic absorbent devices in
which drug metabolites in a sample compete with drug conjugate, immobilized on a
porous support membrane, for a limited number of goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody
binding sites. When a urine sample is applied to a test device, the barbiturates, if
present in the test sample at a concentration of less than 300 ng/mL, will not block the
binding sites of the immobilized antigen conjugate in the test region. The dye
conjugate will migrate to the test region with the urine. There the dye conjugate will
bind to barbiturate derivative immobilized in the test region of the membrane. As a
result, a visible rose pink band will form in the test region, indicating a negative

result. Conversely, where barbiturate concentrations are 300 ng/mL or more the
antibody - dye conjugate binds to free drug forming a complex that competes with the
immobilized antigen conjugate in the test region. This prevents the development of a
rose pink band, indicating a positive sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Eight normal urine pools were spiked with secobarbital to concentrations of 0,
122, 162, 274, 300, 400, 490 and 800 ng/mL and confirmed by GC/MS. One
replicate per level was assayed five times per day for 10 days with the cassette
format. The results are shown in the table below.

The sponsor conducted a bridging study to assess the equivalency of the 4
format types (dipstick, cassette and dip-card and cup). Fifty GC/MS
confirmed urine samples that ranged from 50 to 2000 ng/mL were obtained
from clinical sites and were tested in duplicates. The sponsor’s results
showed 100% agreement between formats.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. This assay in intended for qualitative use.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device has an internal process control. A line appearing in the control
region confirms that sufficient sample volume has been applied and

that the sample has migrated correctly on the test strip. Users are informed not
to interpret the test if a line does not form in the control region. External
controls are not supplied with this device but the manufacturer recommends
the use of external controls in the labeling.
d. Detection limit:
See assay cutoff section below.
e. Analytical specificity:
To test the consistency of the test line and control line development, the
sponsor tested four urine control pools and five patient samples. The pools
and samples were analyzed in replicates of three using three lots of the
QuickScreen Barbiturate 300 dipstick test. The results indicate that the
development times were under the ten minutes given in the package insert.
The sponsor conducted a prozone study to test the effects of high barbiturate
concentrations on the device. A GC/MS confirmed positive urine sample
(>3000 ng/mL) was tested with three lots of the QuickScreen Barbiturate 300
test. The sponsor reported no interference with high barbiturate
concentrations.
The sponsor conducted a prozone effect (hook-effect) study to evaluate the
devices ability to detect high barbiturate concentrations. A GC/MS confirmed
positive for barbiturate (concentration greater than 3000 mg/mL) was tested in
three lots of the QuickScreen™ Test. All results for the barbiturates were
positive and sponsor reports that there was no prozone effect observed.
The sponsor conducted a pH study to test for pH effects on the device. Three
urine samples were aliquoted at barbiturate concentrations of 0, 835, and 3000
ng/mL. Each sample was then again aliquoted into five individual samples
and each was adjusted to pH 4.5 to 8.5 (increments of 1 pH). The sponsor
reports no adverse effect with varying pH levels.
The sponsor conducted a test strip flexibility study to determine the dip time
for the strip test. Five urine samples were selected at random for this study.
The samples had barbiturate concentrations of 0, 0, 449, 531 and 1146 ng/mL.
The sample dip times were varied from 10 seconds to 600 seconds (10
minutes). The samples were run in three assays in triplicates. The samples
produced 100% of the expected results.
The sponsor studied structurally related compounds to test for cross-reactivity
in the QuickScreen Barbiturates 300 test. The compounds were prepared in
normal human urine and the results (below) were expressed as the amount of
compound capable of giving a result equivalent to 300 ng/mL secobarbital.
