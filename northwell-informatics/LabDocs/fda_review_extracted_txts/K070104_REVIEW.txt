L. Test Principle:
The proLYTE measures sodium, potassium and chloride in whole blood, serum, plasma, and
urine, using ion selective electrode technology. The flow-through sodium electrode contains
a glass tube, specially formulated to be sensitive to sodium ions. The flow-through potassium
and chloride electrodes incorporate a neutral carrier ionophore membrane. The potential of
each electrode is measured relative to a fixed, stable voltage established by the silver/silver
chloride reference electrode. An ion selective electrode develops a voltage that varies with
the concentration of the ion to which it responds. The relationship between the voltage
developed and the concentration of the sensed ion is logarithmic.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run precision was calculated with results from three whole blood, serum,
plasma, and urine samples for each analyte. The samples concentrations were at the
low and high end of the measuring range and within the measuring range. The
protocol called for running 40 replicates of each sample without calibration between
measurements. The replicates were run consecutively in one day. Some of the
samples had fewer replicates due to instrument errors. The results are summarized
below.

Total precision was calculated with results from three whole blood, serum, plasma,
and urine samples for each analyte. The samples concentrations were at the low and
high end of the measuring range and within the measuring range. The samples were
measured twice each morning and twice each afternoon for ten consecutive days
resulting in n=40 replicates. One whole blood sample and three urine samples had
n=39 replicates due to instrument errors. The results are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated by preparing stock solutions with high concentrations of
Na+, K+, and Cl- in whole blood, plasma, serum, and urine. These stocks were
diluted to concentrations across the measuring ranges of each analyte and matrix.
Linear regression was performed on the results using expected values based on the
stock sample dilution. The reportable ranges claimed for whole blood, serum, and
plasma are 45-210 mmol/L for sodium and chloride and 1.5-12 mmol/L for
potassium. The reportable ranges claimed for urine are 30-1020 mmol/L for sodium,
20-505 mmol/L for potassium, and 25-506 mmol/L for chloride. The results are
shown below.

Calibrators were previously cleared under k031159.
d. Detection limit:
Reportable ranges were determined based on the linearity studies (see above).
e. Analytical specificity:
Plasma samples were prepared with high and low concentrations of sodium (129 and
151 mmol/L), potassium (3 and 5.7 mmol/L), and chloride (84 and 115 mmol/L).
Interferents were added to these samples and tested. The results were compared to
sodium, potassium, and chloride samples without interferent. No interference was
defined by the sponsor as a difference of <2 mmol/L for sodium, <0.25 mmol/L for
potassium, and <2.8 mmol/L for chloride. The following compounds did not interfere
with the results: Salicylic acid at 5 mM, Bilirubin at 500 uM, Triglycerides at 30 mM,
Lithium at 3.2 mM, and 40% hematocrit. Albumin, Bromide, and Thiocyanate did
cause interference at the concentrations shown below.
