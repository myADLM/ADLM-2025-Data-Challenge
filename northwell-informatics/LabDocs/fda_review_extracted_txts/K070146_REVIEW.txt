M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:

--- Page 5 ---
Within Run Precision:
Precision was based upon CLSI EP05-A2 using 2 controls and 3 patient
samples covering the measuring range of the assay were tested in duplicate for
20 days, two runs per day. Data is presented in mg/dL:
Sample N Mean SD CV%
Control N 80 363 1.6 1,24
Control P 80 628 1.66 0.74
Sample 1 80 257 1.61 1.76
Sample 2 80 488 2.51 1.44
Sample 3 80 1465 3.75 0.72
Between run and Total Precision
Based upon the CLSI EP-5A, two controls and 4 patient samples were tested
in duplicate for 20 days, two series per day. Data is presented in mg/dL:
Sample N Mean SD CV%
Control N 80 361 4.89 3.80
Control P 80 607 8.92 4.13
Sample 1 80 556 6.78 3.42
Sample 2 80 1538 16.85 3.08
Sample 3 80 63 1.67 7.5
Sample 4 80 1852 20.30 3.08
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity determination was based upon CLSI EP6-A. Urea concentrations
were prepared by diluting a high concentration sample with urine containing a
low concentration of urea. Samples were serially measured from 55 to 2154
mg/dL (19.7 to 766.9 mmol/L). Linear regression statistics were
y=0.9878x+0.1583; r2=0.9998. The linear range tested was 55 to 2154 mg/dL
(19.7 to 766.9 mmol/L). The sponsor claims a measuring range for ABX Urea
CP of 35 – 2106 mg/dL (12.6 to 750 mmol/L).
A post dilution study was performed to test samples above the linear range.
This study was performed by testing 2 samples above the linear limit of the
assay (2200 mg/dL or 800 mmol/L). These tests showed that the automatic
dilution gave a bias of less than 8% up to 10530 mg/dL.
A complementary study was performed to provide additional samples (n=6) to
more thoroughly cover the post-dilution assay range. Spiked samples were

used for this study at concentrations of 2274, 3156, 5060, 6910, 8876, and
9772 mg/dL. Assays were performed on split samples using both manual
dilution and auto-post dilution. A bias of ≤10% was considered observed.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ABX PENTRA Controls are traceable to a Master Lot of Horiba
calibrator that was cleared under k060205.
Real time stability of the control was determined when stored after
lyophilization at 4°C. Results have determined a real time stability of24
months. Pentra Controlclosedstability was determined to be 18 months
Stability after reconstitution was determined on three different lots of controls.
Recovery of each parameter has been analyzed at different storage conditions.
Open stability of the parameters:
12 hours at 15°C to 25°C
5 days at 2°C to 8°C
1 month at -25°C to –15°C
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank was calculated from the mean of 30 measurements of
saline + 4.65SD. The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined to be 35.0 mg/dL
or 12.6 mmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering substances in solution were added to the base urine at two different
urea concentrations (normal and high). Each sample was then serially diluted
with the same neat base urine to adjust urea concentration.
Conclusions:
- Hemoglobin 500mg/dL – 5g/L does not interfere with urea determination
by the Horiba ABX Pentra Urea CP.
- Conjugated Bilirubin up to 38mg/dL does not interfere with urea
determination by the Horiba ABX Pentra Urea CP.
- Ascorbic Acid up to 350 umol/L does not interfere with urea
determination by the Horiba ABX Pentra Urea CP
- Specific Gravity within the range of 1.005 – 1.035 does not interfere
with urea determination by the Horiba ABX Pentra Urea CP
- pH within normal urine pH (5 – 8) does not interfere with urea
determination by the Horiba ABX Pentra Urea CP
