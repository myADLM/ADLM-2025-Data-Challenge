independent operators using three different Tecan Genesis RSP 150 Instruments
tested two panels of culture transport media specimens containing samples
described in the table below. The two panels were prepared on separate days but
were identical in composition. The first panel was tested by all three sites. The
first two sites tested the panel in triplicate, once a day. The third site tested the
panel in triplicate on nine separate days over a period of three weeks. The second
panel was tested by only one site in triplicate, once a day, over a period of five
days. Each run consisted of automated specimen preparation using the Roche
Scripts to direct the Tecan Genesis RSP 150 Instrument, followed by
amplification and detection according to the standard test protocol.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended Positive, Negative and Internal Control material were tested a
sufficient number of times with acceptable results on all testing days.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity of the AMPLICOR CT/NG Test for Neisseria
gonorrhoeae with automated specimen preparation was determined by testing N.
gonorrhoeae ATCC strain 19242. Stock cultures of N. gonorrhoeae were diluted
in M4RT media to prepare specimens that contained 500, 400, 250, 200, 100, and
50 cfu/mL. Following automated specimen preparation using the Roche Scripts
to direct the Tecan Genesis RSP 150 Instrument, the specimens were amplified
and detected according to the standard test protocol.
A total of 24 replicates per dilution for each sample processing/testing
combination were tested. Equivocal results were not repeated, and samples
returning inhibitory results were excluded from data analysis. Absorbance values
≥ 2.0 were considered positive, and < 2.0 negative.
The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection) was defined as the lowest dilution at
which > 95% of all replicates yielded positive results. The analytical sensitivity
of the AMPLICOR CT/NG Test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae with automated
specimen preparation is 100 cfu/mL. This result differs from the current
labeled LoD of 400 CFU/mL. The results of study are presented in the table
below.

e. Analytical specificity:
The analytical specificity was tested using the automated sample preparation
directed by the Roche Scripts compared to the manual method by examining
spiked samples with varying concentrations of the test analytes. The same
method and concentrations used in the Precision panel testing were utilized for
analytical specificity. Data from the different sites were pooled and the
percentage of false positives and negatives were calculated. The following table
shows the agreement of the specificity results between the automated and the
manual methods.

preparation directed by the Roche Scripts; in comparison to manual sample
preparation. This study was designed to observe the effects of potential
aerosolization / splash over the whole plate. Positive specimens or M4 media
blanks were prepared as samples.
Positive samples were prepared from stock cultures of Neisseria gonorrhoeae
(ATCC 19242) at 1.0 x 108 IFU/mL diluted in M4 media and C. trachomatis
(ATCC strain Vr 885, Serovar D) at 1.44 x 107 IFU/mL. High concentration of ~
10,000 IFU/mL of N. gonorrhoeae alone and ~10,000 IFU/mL of both C.
trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae combined were utilized. Map layouts on the 96-
well microtiter plates were constructed to provide adequate opportunity to observe
cross-contamination over multiple plate positions, including a ‘worst case’
scenario of blanks surrounded by positives; and to provide a sufficient number of
blanks to calculate a false positive rate. In addition, a checkerboard pattern was
used to further challenge the performance of the system. Testing was performed
over five days. The overall false positive rate was 0.3% (1/370) with automated
specimen preparation and 1.6% (6/370) with manual preparation. The differences
in the false positivity rates are not statistically significant at the 95% confidence
level.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A prospective study was performed in order to establish that the results obtained
using the automated specimen preparation option are equivalent to results obtained
using the manual specimen preparation option when tested in parallel and compared
to culture.
Two swab specimens were collected from 296 patients. One swab was sent for N.
gonorrhoeae culture and the other swab was placed in M4RT culture transport media
and used for AMPLICOR testing. An aliquot of each M4RT sample was removed and
processed manually, and each sample was also subjected to automated specimen
preparation using the Roche Scripts to direct the Tecan Genesis RSP 150 Instrument.
The specimens were amplified and detected using the AMPLICOR CT/NG Test for
Neisseria gonorrhoeae according to the standard test protocol. An initial qualitative
test result (positive, negative, equivocal, or inhibitory) was assigned for each sample
according to the method manual. Samples were repeated in the case of failed
(invalid) run controls. Samples yielding equivocal or inhibitory results were repeated
according to package insert directions (i.e., repeated in duplicate) by sampling from
the original sample tube, and the final result was used in the data analysis.
Eight samples were excluded from the data analyses : 1 because a culture result was
not obtained, 2 because of missing specimen chain of command paperwork, 5 after
giving repeat results of “inhibitory” with both manual and automated test methods;
resulting in 288 valid data sets. All 5 repeatedly inhibitory specimens came from
females and all five yielded negative culture results. The results from the 288 valid

* The final test interpretation of these specimens should be determined using 2.0 A as
450
the cutoff. Specimens with at least 2 out of 3 results with A ≥ 2.0 should be
450
considered positive for N. gonorrhoeae. If 2 out of 3 results have an A less than 2.0,
450
the specimen is presumptive negative for N. gonorrhoeae.
N. Instrument Name:
Tecan Genesis RSP-RC 150 Workstation Instrument, with Roche Scripts accessory
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Genesis RSP 150 Workstation is a multiple task liquid handling system that
combines a system of microprocessor-controlled liquid handling and other components to
one instrument. The User controls the system via a personal computer, equipped with the
Genesis Instrument Software, Gemini Software v4.2, and the Roche Scripts. Genesis
RSP is designed to handle liquid volumes ranging between 0.5 µL and 5 µL depending
on the installed configuration.
The liquid system is the central component of Genesis pipetting function. It transmits the
precise movement of the diluter pistons to the tips through the system liquid. The system
liquid is delivered to the system in a container and is aspirated and distributed in the
whole system via tubes, valves and connectors. The distribution of the system liquid is
effected by the movement of the diluter pistons in several strokes. Disposable tips with
filter shall be used where no carry over is tolerable.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types in submission K963268:
Yes __X_ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
The Positive Identification (PosID2) reads Barcodes on Carriers, Racks and Containers
on both, the primary, e.g. sample tube, as well as the secondary side, e.g. microplates by
means of a scanner. With its gripper, it pulls carriers towards the rear of the instrument
for barcode identification on tubes and microplates, and then, pushes the carrier back into
operating position. To use the PosID2, all carriers, racks and containers (sample tubes,
microplates, reagent bottles, troughs) must be labeled with barcodes. Exact positioning
of these labels is required for optimal function.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
To minimize the potential for well-to-well carryover, the Roche Scripts direct the liquid
handling arms of the Tecan RSP 150 to discard the pipet tip immediately after any
pipetting step involving contact with a sample- or control containing well. Design
features intended to minimize the potential for cross-contamination via aerosolization and
splashing are listed below:
12

--- Page 13 ---
• Use of disposable pipet tips with aerosol barrier filters
• Low disposable tip eject option: tips are ejected into a narrow slit box to
reduce aerosolization during the ejection step
• Use of a deep well plate for extraction steps
The Gemini 4.2 software and the Tecan Genesis RSP 150 have liquid class settings which
control the accuracy of the aspiration and dispense functions of the liquid handling arm.
These liquid classes have several sub-options which are configured to the liquid being
handled. The sub-options include:
• LAG, STAG, TAG (air gap settings at specific places within the pipet tip)
• Rate / speed of aspiration and dispense settings
• Position of pipet tip in well to optimize liquid aspiration
• Mixing characteristics
5. Calibration:
Liquid class handling settings are determined for each liquid by performing volumetric
test cases. The documentation for the test cases is provided in the submission.
6. Quality Control:
An on-line interactive Troubleshooting guide normally detects problems and offers
immediate advice for corrective actions pertaining to operations, communication,
positioning, and identification errors. Daily, weekly, and periodic preventative
maintenance schedules are provided in the Tecan User Manual.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
The sponsor acknowledges that the analytical studies cited in the risk assessment as
controls for the Tecan functions are more properly identified as verification activities.
Roche audited Tecan, and confirmed that Tecan validated the Gemini v4.2 software.
The Roche Scripts CD’s are standalone software designed to run on Off-the-Shelf (OTS)
Tecan equipment. Roche Scripts are installed at the user site in read-only mode, and
cannot be altered by the User.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
