independent operators using three different Tecan Genesis RSP 150 Instruments
tested two panels of culture transport media specimens containing samples
described in the table below. The two panels were prepared on separate days but
were identical in composition. The first panel was tested by all three sites. The
first two sites tested the panel in triplicate, once a day. The third site tested the
panel in triplicate on nine separate days over a period of three weeks. The second
panel was tested by only one site in triplicate, once a day, over a period of five
days. Each run consisted of automated specimen preparation using the Roche
Scripts to direct the Tecan Genesis RSP 150 Instrument, followed by
amplification and detection according to the standard test protocol.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended Positive, Negative and Internal Control material were tested a
sufficient number of times with acceptable results on all testing days.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Detection of the AMPLICOR™ CT/NG for C. trachomatis with
automated specimen preparation was determined using M4 culture transport
media specimens containing 1.44 x 107 IFU/mL of Chlamydia trachomatis
culture (ATCC strain Vr 885, Serovar D). The panel contained the following
dilutions, which bracket the current labeled limit of detection (in bold):
CT: 2, 5, 20, 50, 80, 100 IFU/mL (0.025, 0.062, 0.250, 0.625. 1.0 and 2.5 IFU/test)
A total of 24 replicates per dilution for each sample processing/testing
combination. Equivocal results were not repeated, and samples returning
inhibitory results were excluded from data analysis. Absorbance values ≥ 2.0
were considered positive, and < 2.0 negative.
The Limit of Detection (LoD), the lowest dilution at which ≥ 95% of replicates
yielded positive results, for COBAS AMPLICOR™ CT/NG for C. trachomatis is
20 IFU/mL (0.25 IFU/test) for both the automated and manual specimen
preparation. The results of study are presented in the table below.
This result differs from the current labeled LoD of 80 IFU/mL.

strain Vr 885, Serovar D) at 1.44 x 107 IFU/mL and Neisseria gonorrhoeae
(ATCC 19242) at 1.0 x 108 IFU/mL diluted in M4 media. High concentration of
~ 10,000 IFU/mL of C. trachomatis alone and ~10,000 IFU/mL of both C.
trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae combined were utilized. Map layouts on the 96-
well microtiter plates were constructed to provide adequate opportunity to observe
cross-contamination over multiple plate positions, including a ‘worst case’
scenario of blanks surrounded by positives; and to provide a sufficient number of
blanks to calculate a false positive rate. In addition, a checkerboard pattern was
used to further challenge the performance of the system. Testing was performed
over five days. The overall false positive rate was 0.5% (2/370) with automated
specimen preparation and 0.3% (1/370) with manual preparation. The differences
in the false positivity rates are not statistically significant at the 95% confidence
level, and the results are equivalent.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
This method comparison study was designed to demonstrate the equivalency
between the automated specimen preparation technique directed by the Roche
Scripts and the manual specimen preparation option when tested in parallel and
compared to culture. A prospective study with 727 samples was performed. The
acceptance criteria were based on a concordance of the initial test results;
inhibitory or equivocal results were not repeated.
Two swab specimens were collected from each of 727 patients. One swab was
sent for C. trachomatis culture and the other swab was placed in M4RT culture
transport media and used for AMPLICOR testing. An aliquot of each M4RT
sample was removed and processed manually, and each sample was also
subjected to automated specimen preparation using the Roche Scripts to direct the
Tecan Genesis RSP 150 Instrument. The specimens were amplified and detected
using the AMPLICOR CT/NG Test for Chlamydia trachomatis according to the
standard test protocol. An initial qualitative test result (positive, negative,
equivocal, or inhibitory) was assigned for each sample according to the method
manual. Samples were repeated in the case of failed (invalid) run controls.
Samples yielding equivocal or inhibitory results were repeated according to
package insert directions (i.e., repeated in duplicate) by sampling from the
original sample tube, and the final result was used in the data analysis.
Forty-five samples were excluded from the data analyses: 8 because culture
results were not obtained, 2 because cultures were declared indeterminate, 3
because of missing specimen chain of command paperwork, 3 due to improper
storage, and 29 after giving repeat results of “equivocal” or “inhibitory”; resulting
in 682 valid data sets. Of the 29 repeatedly equivocal or inhibitory specimens; 7
were from females and 22 were from males and all 29 yielded negative culture
results. The results from the 682 valid data sets are summarized in the table
below. This analysis was also performed separately for males and females with
the results summarized below; as an overall comparison to culture of all samples
(Table A3), and stratified by specimen type: female endocervical and male

N. Instrument Name:
Tecan Genesis RSP-RC 150 Workstation Instrument, with Roche Scripts accessory
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Genesis RSP 150 Workstation is a multiple task liquid handling system that
combines a system of microprocessor-controlled liquid handling and other components to
one instrument. The User controls the system via a personal computer, equipped with the
Genesis Instrument Software, Gemini Software v4.2, and the Roche Scripts. Genesis
RSP is designed to handle liquid volumes ranging between 0.5 µL and 5 µL depending
on the installed configuration.
The liquid system is the central component of Genesis pipetting function. It transmits the
precise movement of the diluter pistons to the tips through the system liquid. The system
liquid is delivered to the system in a container and is aspirated and distributed in the
whole system via tubes, valves and connectors. The distribution of the system liquid is
effected by the movement of the diluter pistons in several strokes. Disposable tips with
filter shall be used where no carry over is tolerable.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types in submission K963268:
Yes __X_ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
The Positive Identification (PosID2) reads Barcodes on Carriers, Racks and Containers
on both, the primary, e.g. sample tube, as well as the secondary side, e.g. microplates by
means of a scanner. With its gripper, it pulls carriers towards the rear of the instrument
for barcode identification on tubes and microplates, and then, pushes the carrier back into
operating position. To use the PosID2, all carriers, racks and containers (sample tubes,
microplates, reagent bottles, troughs) must be labeled with barcodes. Exact positioning
of these labels is required for optimal function.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
To minimize the potential for well-to-well carryover, the Roche Scripts direct the liquid
handling arms of the Tecan RSP 150 to discard the pipet tip immediately after any
pipetting step involving contact with a sample- or control containing well. Design
features intended to minimize the potential for cross-contamination via aerosolization and
splashing are listed below:
• Use of disposable pipet tips with aerosol barrier filters
• Low disposable tip eject option: tips are ejected into a narrow slit box to
11

--- Page 12 ---
reduce aerosolization during the ejection step
• Use of a deep well plate for extraction steps
The Gemini 4.2 software and the Tecan Genesis RSP 150 have liquid class settings which
control the accuracy of the aspiration and dispense functions of the liquid handling arm.
These liquid classes have several sub-options which are configured to the liquid being
handled. The sub-options include:
• LAG, STAG, TAG (air gap settings at specific places within the pipet tip)
• Rate / speed of aspiration and dispense settings
• Position of pipet tip in well to optimize liquid aspiration
• Mixing characteristics
5. Calibration:
Liquid class handling settings are determined for each liquid by performing volumetric
test cases. The documentation for the test cases is provided in the submission.
6. Quality Control:
An on-line interactive Troubleshooting guide normally detects problems and offers
immediate advice for corrective actions pertaining to operations, communication,
positioning, and identification errors. Daily, weekly, and periodic preventative
maintenance schedules are provided in the Tecan User Manual.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
The sponsor acknowledges that the analytical studies cited in the risk assessment as
controls for the Tecan functions are more properly identified as verification activities.
Roche audited Tecan, and confirmed that Tecan validated the Gemini v4.2 software.
The Roche Scripts CD’s are standalone software designed to run on Off-the-Shelf (OTS)
Tecan equipment. Roche Scripts are installed at the user site in read-only mode, and
cannot be altered by the User.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
