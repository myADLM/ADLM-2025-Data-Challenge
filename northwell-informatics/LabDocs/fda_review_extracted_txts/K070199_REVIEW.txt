4. Special instrument requirements:
I. Device Description:
Retic-Chex Linearity for BC is a suspension of stabilized human red blood cells and
simulated human reticulocytes packaged in plastic vials, containing 3.0 mL volumes.
The device consists of five levels of reticulocyte percentage range from 0 to 29.5%.
Closures are injected molded polypropylene screw top caps. The vials are packaged
in a well vacuum formed clam-shell container with the package insert and assay
sheet.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
H38-P Calibration and Quality Control of Automated Hematology Analyzers;
Proposed Standard, 1999, NCCLS
L. Test Principle:
Laboratory agencies mandate that laboratories substantiate their test methods
throughout the reportable range for patient test results. Circumstances which may call
for verification include installation, major preventative maintenance, unusual trends
in control performance, or whenever recommended by the instrument manufacturer.
Retic-Chex Linearity for BC contains retic concentrations which span typical patient
reportable ranges; allowing the user to comply with these guidelines.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility and comparison to whole blood was performed on two lots of
Retic-Chex Linearity for BC and two whole blood samples using the
Beckman Coulter® Gen•S hematology analyzer. Each value was calculated
from 3 consecutive analyses performed on a single vial of product.
Reproducibility is expressed as a CV% and comparably to whole human
blood with respect to run to run recovery.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Open vial stability was assessed by the analysis of two lots to verify
performance throughout the 5 day open vial dating (one vial per level). Data
was collected at least 4 times during the 5 day period. All lots performed as
expected, with parameter recovery within the established assay ranges.
Closed vial stability was assessed by performing analysis of one vial per
level from each of two lots once at least two times per month throughout the
105 day expiration dating. No significant trends occurred and there was a
consistent recovery of values within the indicated assay range.
Parameter value assignments:
Retic-Chex Linearity for BC is designed as a multi-level reticulocyte control
as well as a set of true linearity samples. Each level is prepared by making
quantitative dilutions of level 5. At least 3 vials of each level are randomly
selected and sampled three times. The results are compiled to obtain an assay
value and range for each Level. Expected Range assigned to the assay are
based on an estimate of the standard deviation for the assay data.
d. Detection limit:
Not Applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Not Applicable.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not Applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not Applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not Applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
An expected values sheet is provided with tolerance limits established during the
value assignment process. However, it is recommended that each laboratory
establish its own acceptance criteria.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
