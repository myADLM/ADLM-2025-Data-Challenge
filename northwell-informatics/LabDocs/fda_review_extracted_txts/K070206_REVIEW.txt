K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): N/A
L. Test Principle:
The test kit uses viral antigen-specific murine monoclonal antibodies that are directly
labeled with fluorescein for rapid detection and identification of VZV which are directed
against two antigenic sites on the VZV recombinant protein, glycoprotein E.
The cell cultures are fixed in acetone. The VZV DFA Reagent is added to the monolayers
in cell culture to determine the presence of viral antigens. After incubating, the infected
cells are stained with a fluorescein conjugated MAb while uninfected cells and are
counterstained with an Evan’s Blue dye. The stained cells are subsequently rinsed,
overlaid with a drop of supplied mounting fluid, and the monolayer is protected with a
coverslip. Cells are then examined using a fluorescence microscope.
Interpretation of results: A result is considered positive when a cell cytoplasm and/or
nucleus presents with a finely granular bright apple-green fluorescence. Uninfected cells
will stain dull red due to the Evan’s Blue counter-stain which is included with this device.

fifty-four (254) prospectively collected specimens submitted for VZV culture.
Each specimen was evaluated by the D3 DFA VZV Identification Kit and
compared to a currently marketed VZV identification kit. A combination of fresh
(61) and frozen (193) specimens were tested. The numbers of fresh and frozen
specimens tested are summarized below.

3. Clinical studies: A total of (254) prospectively collected specimens were submitted
for VZV culture. Three of the fresh specimens from Site 2 were toxic to cell culture
and were not evaluated by either test. One specimen from Site 3 was negative in the
multi-well plate culture, but was positive in the tube culture 10-days post inoculation.
These evaluations were conducted at two external laboratory sites and one in-house

iii Study Site 3: A total of 120 specimens were cultured for VZV. Briefly, two
hundred microliters (200-μL) of each specimen was inoculated into one well
per specimen of a multi-well plate and a single cell culture tube. The
inoculated plates were centrifuged at 700xg for 60-minutes, incubated at 35°
to 37°C for 72-hours then stained in accordance with each respective product
insert (DHI and comparison devices). The results of this testing are
summarized in Table 8a. The inoculated tubes were read for CPE daily for
14-days. Tubes exhibiting CPE were scraped and cell spots made on
multiwell slides according to the comparison device’s product insert
procedure (the same procedure was used for both the DHI and the comparison
devices). Tubes exhibiting no CPE at 14-days were also scraped and cell
spots made to confirm the absence of VZV. The cell spots were fixed with
acetone in accordance with each respective product insert (DHI and
comparison device). The results of testing at this site, in house, are
summarized in the two tables below.

a. Clinical specificity:
Cross reactivity testing:This device was tested for cross-reactivity against a wide
variety of cells and microorganisms compared to the predicate. No cross-
reactivity was observed for 55 virus strains (cultured and processed for staining)
or for 20 host culture cell types. Twenty-seven (27) bacterial cultures and one (1)
yeast culture were stained and examined for cross-reactivity, including
Staphylococcus aureus, a protein-A-producing bacterium. Staining of S. aureus
appeared as small points of fluorescence while all other bacterial cultures were
negative. [See Tables below for cross-reactivity study results.]
Stringent conditions for cross-reactivity testing were achieved by using a high
concentration of this device and relatively high titers of microorganisms. The
DFA Reagent was prepared at 1.5X the concentration that is provided in the kit.
.
• Fifty-five (55) virus strains were tested for cross reactivity. Depending on the
particular virus, 150 to 2100 TCID viruses were inoculated into a shell vial
50
culture and incubated for 24 to 48 hours, to yield a 1+ to 3+ infection,
processed and stained with the 1.5X DFAs according to the procedure detailed
in the product insert. No cross reactivity was observed for the viruses listed
below.

• Twenty-eight microorganisms, including one (1) yeast culture and twenty-seven (27)
bacterial cultures, were stained with the 1.5X DFA Reagent according to the
procedure as detailed in this product insert, then examined for cross-reactivity.
Except for Staphylococcus aureus, which was cross reactive with the VZV DFA
Reagent (see above), all microorganisms tested negative. Concentrations for each
bacterial organism cultured by DHI for cross reactivity testing were determined from
suspensions of the bacteria in PBS by spectrophotometer according to McFarland
standards of 1.0 and 2.0 (equaling approximately 3.0 x 106 and 6.0 x 106 x 104 CFU
per mL). Slides were prepared with spots of 0.01-mL of the suspensions to give
either 3.0 x 104 or 6.0 x 104 per spot. At the same time, 1-mL of each suspension was
plated on an appropriate agar dish for colony confirmation. According to the
confirmation agar cultures, initial concentrations of the bacterial organisms in the
study ranged from 6.4 x 104 to 2.9 x 107 CFU. Results of testing are listed below.

Demographics by age and gender for the specimens that were tested at the 3
Study Sites are tabulated below.
Of the specimens evaluated in these studies (which had been submitted to the
laboratories as swabs taken from lesions for both HSV and VZV testing), a large
proportion were from patients between the ages of 18 and 40. Prevalence of VZV
within the population tested was quite low (due in part to varicella vaccination
programs). The patient demographics are listed below.
