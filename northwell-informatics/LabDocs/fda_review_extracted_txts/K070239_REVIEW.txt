L. Test Principle:
Once a whole blood sample is applied to the sample chamber of the test strip, the
process of glucose measurement commences. Glucose measurement is based on
electrical potential caused by the reaction of glucose with the reagents contained on
the strip’s electrodes. The glucose in the sample is oxidized by the enzyme glucose
oxidase, producing gluconic acid. The electrical current resulting from this enzymatic
reaction is measured and converted to glucose concentration by the meter. The
magnitude of the current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated within-day precision of the device using pooled whole
blood samples spiked with five different glucose concentrations, three
different reagent lots, and 10 different TD-4224 glucose meters. Each
combination of multivariate factors was evaluated using 10 measurements.
Day-to-day precision was evaluated using three glucose control solutions with
concentration levels, low (61-93 mg/dL), normal (108-162 mg/dL), and high
(260-390 mg/dL). The day-to-day precision was evaluated over a ten-day
period using three different reagent lots and ten TD-4224 glucose meters. The
summary of test results are presented below.

High 100 307.7 8.62 2.80
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor used nine spiked whole blood samples in the range (20-600
mg/dL) as reference values and compared with the values generated from
YSI2300 analyzer. A regression analysis showed linearity of Maximed
Exichek TD-4224 blood glucose monitoring system with correlation
coefficient (r) of 0.9991 with regression equation of y = 0.9959X + 4.4273.
The sponsor verified accuracy of the device over the reportable range (20 –
600 mg/dL) against a standard detection method (YSI-2300; see Method
Comparison below).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibration is traceable to the YSI instrument. The values for the control
materials are verified by testing the material on multi meters over 30 days to
obtain the mean and standard deviation. The ranges are assigned based upon
the ISO criteria.
The sponsor provided data to confirm the stability of both strips and control
solutions for 90-day period recommended in the package insert. The sponsor
conducted studies to evaluate the in-use stability of the TD-4224 glucose
monitoring system at the assigned temperature range of 50oF-104oF (10oC-
40oC). Using control solutions at low, medium and high concentration, tested
at 50oF and 104oF compared with room temperature, results showed <2% CV
for all glucose concentrations and met the acceptability criterion (<5% CV).
Using control solutions, the sponsor also conducted studies to evaluate the
meter reliability at mechanical resistance to drop and vibration as well as the
effect of temperature and relative humidity on the glucose meter. TD-4224
met the acceptability criterion of <5% CV at each variant condition.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit is 20 mg/dL. See the linearity study.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor tested the following exogenous and endogenous substances for
interference. Based on a criterion of a mean glucose difference of ± 10% of
the glucose values obtained in the absence of interfering substances, the
following conclusions were drawn with regard to interfering substances:

The sponsor evaluated the effect of hematocrit levels 20 – 60% on whole
blood samples spiked with glucose values (6 levels) ranging from
approximately 23 to 486 mg/dL. The values generated were compared with
the glucose values from YSI-2300 analyzer. The results indicated below
showed that bias introduced at hematocrit levels between 20% and 60% were
within ± 15%.

An altitude study was performed with whole blood samples from 20
volunteers and 3 control solutions at low, medium and high concentrations.
All the controls met the sponsors acceptability criterion of CV<5% for the
control solutions measured at sea level and at an altitude of 10,744 feet.
Altitude differences within individuals met the acceptability criterion of
±15mg/dL deviation for glucose concentration of <75 mg/dL and ±20%
deviation for glucose concentration of ≥75 mg/dL.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor demonstrated that the Maximed Exichek TD-4224 Blood
Glucose Monitoring System for finger stick is equivalent to a standard
reference method (YSI-2300). Samples from 136 volunteers with glucose

samples corresponding to the glucose concentration ranged as follows: 20-50
mg/dL – 5%; 51-110 mg/dL – 31%; 111-150 mg/dL – 14%; 151-250 mg/dL –
40%; 251- 400 mg/dL – 18%; and 401-600 mg/dL – 6%. Based on data
analysis, the device met the minimum system accuracy requirement
established according to the ISO 15197 guidelines as follows:

The sponsor also conducted a consumer study to evaluate the accuracy of
glucose measurement between the lay-user and the healthcare professionals.
Using 131 volunteer samples (Glucose range: 39 – 301 mg/dL) at three
distribution sites, they showed the device meets their acceptability criteria as
well as ISO-15197 criteria with 96% of individual differences within
±15mg/dL deviation for glucose concentrations of <75 mg/dL and ±20%
deviation for glucose concentrations of ≥75 mg/dL.
The sponsor conducted the alternative site testing (AST) using the palm, the
forearm, the upper arm, the calf, and the thigh in comparison to data obtained
using finger. Regression results are shown below and the percentage of results
meeting ISO-15197 acceptance criteria for accuracy.

Documentation was provided at a moderate level of concern.
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, the
palm, the forearm, the upper-arm, the calf, and the thigh only. Since the whole
blood sample is applied directly to the test strip, there are no special handling or
storage issues.
5. Calibration:
A code strip is provided with each batch of test strips to calibrate the meter for
that batch.
No further calibrations are required of the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor is providing low, medium and high glucose control solutions with
this device. When a test strip is inserted into the meter, the control mode can be
activated. This prevents control results from being stored in the internal memory.
An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label.
The user is referred to the troubleshooting section of the owner’s manual if
control results fall outside these ranges.

Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
