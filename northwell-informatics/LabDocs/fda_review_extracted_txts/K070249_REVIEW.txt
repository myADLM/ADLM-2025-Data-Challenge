b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Amylase:
To evaluate linearity, different levels of amylase (from saliva) solutions were tested
without post-dilution, in accordance with CLSI document, EP6-A. The acceptable
bias with the linearity is ± 8%. Two studies were conducted, and the method was
demonstrated to be linear from 105 to 2184 U/L and from 7.2 to 149.9 U/L.
Combining the ranges, the data supports the linearity claim of 7.2 to 2000 U/L.
A study was performed to compare manual dilution with the automatic dilution
performed by the Pentra 400. Human urines spiked with amylase solutions at
different activities higher than the linearity were used, and the mean of manual and
automatic results were calculated. The acceptable bias with the linearity is ± 8%. The
samples ranged from 2166.4 to 5909.0 U/L and yielded acceptable bias,

from 0.55 to 6.91 mmol/L (2.21 to 27.70 mg/dL), supporting the linearity claim of up
to 6 mmol/L (24.06 mg/dL).
A study was performed to compare manual dilution with the automatic dilution
performed by the Pentra 400. Human urines spiked with calcium solutions at different
activities higher than the linearity were used, and the mean of manual and automatic
results were calculated. The acceptable bias with the linearity is ± 10%. The samples
ranged from 24.29 to 47.68 mg/dL and yielded acceptable bias, substantiating the
post-dilution claim of up to 48.12 mg/dL.
Creatinine:
To evaluate linearity, different concentrations of aqueous creatinine solutions were
tested without post-dilution, in accordance with CLSI document, EP6-A. The
acceptable bias with the linearity is ± 8%. The method was demonstrated to be linear
from 138 to 29070 μmol/L (1.56 to 328.49 mg/dL), supporting the linearity claim of
up to 28000 μmol/L (316.4 mg/dL).
A study was performed to compare manual dilution with the automatic dilution
performed by the Pentra 400. Human urines spiked with creatinine solutions at
different activities higher than the linearity were used, and the mean of manual and
automatic results were calculated. The acceptable bias with the linearity is ± 8%. The
samples ranged from 29604 to 81372 μmol/L and yielded acceptable bias,
substantiating the post-dilution claim of up to 84000 μmol/L (949.2 mg/dL).
Phosphorus:
To evaluate linearity, different concentrations of aqueous phosphate solutions were
tested without post-dilution, in accordance with CLSI document, EP6-A. The
acceptable bias with the linearity is ± 8%. The method was demonstrated to be linear
from 1.72 to 67.69 mmol/L (5.33 to 209.84 mg/dL), supporting the linearity claim of
up to 64 mmol/L (198.4 mg/dL).
A study was performed to compare manual dilution with the automatic dilution
performed by the Pentra 400. Human urines spiked with phosphate solutions at
different activities higher than the linearity were used, and the mean of manual and
automatic results were calculated. The acceptable bias with the linearity is ± 8%. The
samples ranged from 66.21 to 125.7 mmol/L and yielded acceptable bias,
substantiating the post-dilution claim of up to 128 mmol/L (396.8 mg/dL).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The controls are biological source material. The serum from each donor contributing
urine for this product was tested by FDA accepted methods and found non-reactive
for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg), antibody to Hepatitis C (HCV) and
antibody to HIV-1/HIV-2.
The values of the controls are assigned from the ABX PENTRA master calibrator,
reagents and analyzers and are lot-specific. The target values are the median of
multiple determinations. The values are verified by performing additional
measurements and comparing the means to the values and conference ranges
assigned.
The shelf-life stability of the controls was evaluated using two lots and was
determined to be 2 years in unopened vials stored at 2-8°C. The stability after
opening was evaluated by testing recovery of results between time of opening and
time at expiration point. The stability was determined to be 30 days at 2-8°C, with
vial tightly closed when not in-use.
d. Detection limit:
The minimum detection limit (MDL), based on the Valtec guideline (Vassault et al.,
Ann. Biol. Clin., 1986 (44), 686-745), is calculated from 30 measurements of
physiological water (NaCl 0.9 g/L). The MDL is equal to the mean of the
measurements + 4.65 SD.
Amylase: The MDL is 4.92 U/L.
Calcium: The MDL is 0.03 mmol/L or 0.12 mg/dL.
Creatinine: The MDL is 110.83 μmol/L or 1.3 mg/dL.
Phosphorus: The MDL is 0.41 mmol/L or 1.28 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering substances in solution were added to pooled human urine with two
different analyte concentrations (normal and high), for each of the four analytes
below. The interference study was performed following the Valtec guideline
(Vassault et al., Ann. Biol. Clin., 1986 (44), 686-745).
Amylase: Hemoglobin up to 290 µmol/L (500 mg/dL) and conjugated bilirubin up to
650 µmol/L (38 mg/dL) do not interfere with amylase determination by this test.
Calcium: Hemoglobin up to 278 µmol/L (479 mg/dL) and conjugated bilirubin up to
350 µmol/L (20.5 mg/dL) do not interfere with calcium determination by this test.
Creatinine: Hemoglobin up to 290 µmol/L (500 mg/dL) and conjugated bilirubin up
to 650 µmol/L (38 mg/dL) do not interfere with creatinine determination by this test.
10

--- Page 11 ---
Phosphorus: Hemoglobin up to 213 µmol/L (367 mg/dL) and conjugated bilirubin up
to 650 µmol/L (38 mg/dL) do not interfere with phosphorus determination by this
test.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Comparison studies were performed using recommendations in CLSI EP9-A2.
Amylase:
One hundred and twenty-one (121) human urine specimens were analyzed on the
subject device and a commercially available assay. The samples ranged from 13.3 to
1955.6 U/L. The linear regression equation was as follows: y = 1.133x + 42.179, r =
0.9945. Using Passing-Bablock regression procedure, y = 1.17x + 21.90, r = 0.9891.
Based on CLSI EP21-A and the comparison study, the average bias is 9.1%.
Calcium:
One hundred and twenty-four (124) human urine specimens were analyzed on the
subject device and a commercially available assay. The samples ranged from 0.26 to
23.68 mg/dL (0.06 to 5.90 mmol/L). The linear regression equation was as follows: y
= 1.152x – 0.830, r = 0.9952. Using Passing-Bablock regression procedure, y = 1.13x
– 0.50, r = 0.99. Based on the CLSI document EP21-A and the comparison study, the
average bias is 1.0%.
Creatinine:
One hundred and ten (110) human urine specimens were analyzed on the subject
device and a commercially available assay. The samples ranged from 2.8 to 311.5
mg/dL (248 to 27566 μmol/L). The linear regression equation was as follows: y =
0.977x + 1.152, r = 0.9976. Using Passing-Bablock regression procedure, y = 0.99x –
0.98, r = 0.9953. Based on the CLSI document EP21-A and the comparison study, the
average bias is -1.1%.
Phosphorus:
One hundred and nineteen (119) human urine specimens were analyzed on the subject
device and a commercially available assay. The samples ranged from 2.2 to 196.8
mg/dL (0.7 to 63.5 mmol/L). The linear regression equation was as follows: y =
1.091x – 2.555, r = 0.9946. Using Passing-Bablock regression procedure, y = 1.07x –
