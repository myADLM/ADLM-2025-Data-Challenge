L. Test Principle: A suspected specimen is inoculated into tube culture, shell vials or
multi-well plates coated containing a monolayer of cells known to be sensitive to
HSV. When infected with HSV, a characteristic deterioration of cells, termed
cytopathic effect (CPE), can be observed. Tube culture can take several days before
CPE is evident. However, the rate of isolation may be enhanced including a decreased
time for identification and typing of inoculated specimens by centrifugation in shell
vials or multi-well plates. Monolayers are fixed in acetone with a slide(s) prepared
from tube culture scrapings or from shell vials or multi-well plates.
The D3 DFA HSV-1 or HSV-2 Reagents are added to separate monolayers. After
incubating, the stained cells are washed and, covered with a supplied Mounting Fluid.
The fixed monolayers are examined using a fluorescence microscope. The HSV-1
and HSV-2 DFA reagents contain Evan’s Blue as a counter-stain. HSV-1 or HSV-2
infected cells will both stain with a characteristic bright apple-green fluorescence
distinguished from the counter-stained uninfected cells by a dull red fluorescence.

i. Analytical specificity was evaluated by staining cultures infected with a
number of ATCC reference HSV-1 and HSV-2 strains and found to react
with all of them. The D3 HSV-1 and HSV-2 DFA reagents were tested for
cross-reactivity against a wide variety of other microorganisms and cells.
No cross-reactivity was observed for 59 virus strains (cultured and
processed for staining) or for 17 host culture cell types. Conditions for
cross-reactivity testing were achieved by using the D3 HSV-1 or HSV-2
DFA Reagent along with relatively high titers of microorganisms. The
DFA Reagents were prepared at 1.5X the concentration that is provided in
the kit.
1. Depending on the particular virus, 500 to 715 TCID viruses were
50
inoculated into multi-well plate cultures and incubated for 24 hours,
processed and stained with the 1.5X DFAs according to the procedure
detailed in the product insert. Stained cells were examined at 200x
magnification. Cell cultures were stained as confluent monolayers.
Bacteria and yeast were cultured, processed as suspensions, then
spotted on microscope slides (at CFUs ranging from 6.4x104 to
2.93x107/well in a 10 µL dot, depending on the bacterium), then
stained with the 1.5X DFAs according to the procedure in the product
insert.
2. Twenty-seven (27) bacterial cultures, one yeast and one protozoan
culture were stained and examined for cross-reactivity, including
Staphylococcus aureus, a protein-A-producing bacterium. Staining of
S. aureus appeared as small points of fluorescence while all other
cultures were negative. [Protein A will specifically bind to the Fc
portions of conjugated antibodies. Such binding can be distinguished
from viral antigen binding on the basis of morphology, i.e., S. aureus-
bound fluorescence appears as small (~1 micron diameter), bright
dots.]

and one (401) prospectively collected specimens submitted for Herpes
simplex culture. Each specimen was evaluated by the Diagnostic Hybrids D3
DFA Herpes Simplex Virus Identification and Typing Kit (“D3 DFA HSV ID
& Typing Kit”) and compared to a currently marketed HSV identification kit
(“Comparison Device”). A combination of fresh (154) and frozen (247)
specimens were tested. Three specimens from site 3 were not evaluated due
to bacterial contamination of the monolayers, leaving 398 for analysis. These
studies were conducted at two external laboratory sites located in the mid-
west United States and one in-house virology laboratory.
Percent Agreement between the D3 DFA HSV ID & Typing Kit and the
Comparison Devices was calculated and tabulated for all the tested specimens,

specimen was inoculated into MRC-5 and A549 tubes, one tube for each
HSV type. The inoculated cells were incubated at 35° to 37°C and
examined daily for CPE for seven days. Tube cultures exhibiting no CPE
after seven days of incubation were scraped and cell spots made on multi-

ii. Study Site 2: A total of 150 fresh specimens were cultured for HSV.
Briefly, an aliquot from each specimen was inoculated into MRC-5 tubes,
one tube for each HSV type. The inoculated cells were incubated at 35° to
37°C and examined daily for CPE. Tube cultures exhibiting CPE were
scraped and cell spots made on multi-well slides according to the D3 DFA
HSV ID & Typing Kit and Comparison Device product insert procedures.
Tube cultures exhibiting no CPE at 7-days were also scraped and cell
spots made to confirm the absence of HSV. All 150 specimens were
tested for the presence of HSV. All calculations for confidence intervals
were done according to the Exact Method. The results of this testing site
are summarized below (Table 7).
