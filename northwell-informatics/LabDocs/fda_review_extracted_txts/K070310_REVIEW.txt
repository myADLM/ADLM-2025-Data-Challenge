L. Test Principle:
The B·R·A·H·M·S KRYPTOR® analyzer is a fully automated system. The B·R·A·H·M·S
KRYPTOR® analyzer is a closed system and can only operate utilizing special reagents
provided by B·R·A·H·M·S Aktiengesellschaft. The measuring principle is based on
Time-Resolved Amplified Cryptate Emission (TRACE®) technology, which measures the
signal that is emitted from an immunocomplex with time delay.
The basis of the TRACE® technology is a non-radiative energy transfer from a donor [a
cage-like structure with a europium ion in the center (cryptate)] to an acceptor (XL 665).
The proximity of donor (cryptate) and acceptor (XL 665) in a formed immunocomplex
and the spectral overlap between donor emission and acceptor absorption spectra on the
one hand intensifies the fluorescent signal and on the other hand extends the life span of
the acceptor signal, allowing for the measurement of temporally delayed fluorescence.
After the sample to be measured has been excited with a nitrogen laser at 337 nm, the
donor (cryptate) emits a long-life fluorescent signal in the milli-second range at 620 nm,
while the acceptor (XL 665) generates a short-life signal in the range of nano-seconds at
665 nm. When both components are bound in an immunocomplex, both the signal
amplification and the prolonged life span of the acceptor signal occur at 665 nm, and the
life is in the microsecond range. This delayed acceptor signal is proportional to the
concentration of the analyte to be measured.
The specific fluorescence which is proportional to the antigen concentration is obtained
through a double selection: spectral (separation depending on wave-length) and temporal
4

(time resolved measurement). This enables an exclusive measurement of the signal
emitted by the immunological complex and the ratio between the two wave-lengths
(665/620) allows a real-time correction of the variations in optic transmission from the
medium.

In addition total precision ranged from 3.2 – 13.4% CV and within run precision ranged from 1.0
– 13.6% CV
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Nine to ten samples with different levels of PCT were diluted with kit diluents by the
KRYPTOR. Three batches of reagents and three analyzers were used in the study.
Measurements at each dilution level were done in duplicate. For each sample, at least
4 dilution levels plus the undiluted sample were analyzed. The study was done
according to EP6-A. Deviation of the individual samples was calculated in percent
deviation of the undiluted sample. Measured concentrations were multiplied with the
dilution factor and a linear regression analysis was provided in a graph for each data
run. The linearity of diluted samples was acceptable over the whole concentration
range.
High concentration samples (>50ng/ml) are detected by the analyzer in the first few
seconds of incubation and may be diluted by the appropriate dilution factor, then re-
assayed automatically. The system can detect samples greater than 50ng/ml up to
5000ng/ml.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability testing was performed by storing the reagent unit, calibrator and controls at
2-8°C up to their expiry date namely 13 months for the reagent and 2 yrs for
6

calibrator and controls. Testing was also done under thermo stress conditions namely
2 days at 18 -25°C, then at 37°C, then frozen and tested after thawing. The stability of
the conjugates in the reconstituted reagent was also assessed namely 29 days for the
reagent on board the analyzer, 4 hrs at 18-25 °C for the calibrator and 24 hours at 2-
8°C or up to one month at <-16°C. Results of stability were acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity for the B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR® is 0.02 ng/ml.
The analytical sensitivity is calculated following CLSI EP17-A guideline as follows:
20 determination of a sample with no PCT are performed. This sample with no PCT was
prepared either by storage 1 day at 37°C or by addition of A179 anti-PCT polyclonal
antibody. At the end, this “free PCT sample” was different in each run.
20 determination of RS002, a recombinant PCT preparation with a very low amount of
PCT are performed. This sample is the same for each run.
This protocol is reproduced three time; 3 different KRYPTOR PCT reagent unit batches
and 2 different KRYPTOR were used for these 3 runs.
Then, analysis of measurement is done as follows:
Firstly, Limit of Blank (LoB) value is determined by the 95th percentile of
concentrations for a sample that does not contain PCT.
Then, Limit of Detection (LoD = Analytical detection limit) is equal to LoB+CβxSDs,
where Cβ is derived from the standard Gaussian distribution (Cβ=1.645/(1-1/(4xf)),
where f is the degrees of freedom for the estimated standard deviation SDs) and SDs is
the standard deviation of concentration for sample RS002.
The analytical detection limit determination is based on 3 runs utilizing three (3)
different lots of B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR® and two (2) KRYPTOR®
instruments.

Limit of Detection for the B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR® is 0.0227 ng/ml.
The Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) was determined following EP17-P as follows:
. Samples at different targets (from 0.06 ng/ml to 0.075 ng/ml) were prepared with master
calibrators for which actual concentrations were determined independently.
. These samples were run in 5 runs, with 10 replicates per run, thus a total of 50 replicates
per sample.
. For the 5 runs, 3 different KRYPTOR instruments and 2 different batches of reagents
were used.
. For each sample, the total standard deviation (SD ) was calculated as well as the
s
difference between the mean of all replicates and the reference value of the sample (bias)
and imprecision with 95% probability (2 x SD ).
s
The LOQ determined as the lowest reported concentration level with total error
(imprecision + bias) ≤ 30% was determined at 0.075 ng/ml
Results for replicates and SD , imprecision and bias calculation are shown below:

A correlation study was performed between the BRAHMS PCT sensitive KRYPTOR
assay and the BRAHMS PCT LIA assay There were 184 samples from three sites,
which had B·R·A·H·M·S PCT LIA measurements of 0.3 ng/ml (the functional assay
sensitivity of B·R·A·H·M·S PCT LIA) or higher and/or B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive
KRYPTOR® measurements of 0.06 ng/ml (the functional assay sensitivity of
B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR®) or higher. Passing-Bablock analysis shows
a nearly perfect correlation of the B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR® assay and
B·R·A·H·M·S PCT LIA assay, as demonstrated in the correlation graph below.

b. Matrix comparison:
A study was conducted comparing serum and plasma samples using 10 spiked patient
specimens. The samples were tested in triplicate using serum tubes, heparin plasma
tubes, EDTA plasma tubes and citrate plasma tubes. Results demonstrated that both
serum and plasma tubes can be used for the assay but citrate plasma tubes are not
recommended because concentrations of PCT decreased in those tubes.

Data support the following interpretative risk assessment criteria:
PCT > 2 ng/ml
PCT levels above 2.0 ng/ml on the first day of ICU admission represent a high risk
for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.
PCT < 0.5 ng/ml
PCT levels below 0.5 ng/ml on the first day of ICU admission represent a low risk
for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.
Note: PCT levels below 0.5 ng/ml do not exclude an infection, because localized
infections (without systemic signs) may also be associated with such low levels. If the
PCT measurement is done very early after the systemic infection process has started
(usually < 6 hours), these values may still be low.
As various non-infectious conditions are known to induce PCT as well, PCT levels
between 0.5 ng/ml and 2.0 ng/ml should be reviewed carefully to take into account the
specific clinical background and condition(s) of the individual patient.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
A study was conducted with the BRAHMS KRYPTOR to determine the prevalence of
PCT in a normal population in the US. Data showed that the PCT concentrations for 146
of the 151 samples tested were < 0.1 ng/ml. Five samples were greater than 0.1ng/ml.
N. Instrument Name:
BRAHMS KRYPTOR analyzer
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The analyzer is provided in two models, the Model E and the Compact. They differ in
physical size and consequently in the number of wells in the reaction and dilution plates
and the number of tests that can be performed. Both models have the same features
including the same laser, methodology, incubation time and temperature and
calculations/algorithms as well as utilizing the same reagents, calibrators and controls.
Documentation provided for Model E is applicable to both models. The analyzer is a
fully automated system, able to process multiple samples each day in random access
mode. The analyzer is a closed system and can only operate utilizing especially made
reagent kits from BRAHMS. The system is based on TRACE (Time Resolved Amplified
Cryptate Emission) technology. The analyzer has a built in computer to handle the
required controls to store reagents, dispense reagents, patient samples, calibrators and
controls, and incubate the reagent-sample mixture and measure sample concentration.
The external computer will program the analyzer for the required tests and calculate

patient results.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes __X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
The assay procedure includes registering and/or loading the samples, reagent kit,
calibrator and controls as applicable
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
A sample volume of 50µl is needed for each test. Initially a worklist for the day is created
and the test is started. The sample probe of the analyzer pipettes and dispenses the
conjugates from the reagent kit and the sample into the wells. The probe is heated to
incubate the reagent-sample mixture so it is at 37°C prior to dispensing and mixing in the
reaction well. The analyzer makes periodic measurement of the signal emitted. Samples
>50ng/ml are detected, diluted and re-assayed automatically. After measurement of the
fluorescent signal, the program compares each result obtained with the stored standard
curve.
5. Calibration:
A standard curve does not need to be established for the BRAHMS PCT sensitive
KRYPTOR assay on the analyzer. A standard curve is included with the bar code
information from the calibration card and is stored in the analyzer. A calibration is
carried out before the first use of a reagent batch, and then repeated on a regular basis
(i.e. first use and every 15 days thereafter). Calibrations are performed using a
disposable calibrator vial in order to readjust the standard curve.
6. Quality Control:
The KRYPTOR QC is provided for use as quality control on board the instrument for the
assay of procalcitonin. The kit contains 2 series of 3 lyophilized vials, a bar code card,
bar code stick-on labels and the summary of concentration ranges by level. The bar code
card contains information related to the control batch, particularly the target
concentrations, the standard deviations obtained and the concentration acceptance ranges.
Controls are flagged above or below normal (+2 SD) according to the defined control
range. The BRAHMS KRYPTOR can automatically check the quality of assays at
intervals by statistical analysis on Levy Jennings graphs. National quality assurance
guidelines for medical lab tests must be followed e.g. test accuracy and precision can be
monitored by means of lab in-house and/or commercially available control materials
