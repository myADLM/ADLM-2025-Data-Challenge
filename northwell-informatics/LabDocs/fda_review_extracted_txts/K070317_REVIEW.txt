L. Test Principle:
The Zeus VZV IgM ELISA test is designed to detect IgM class antibodies to VZV in
human sera. Wells of plastic microwell strips are sensitized by passive absorption
with VZV antigen. The test procedure involves three incubation steps:
1. Test sera are diluted with the Sample Diluent provided. The Sample Diluent
contains anti-human IgG that is intended to bind the IgG and rheumatoid factor
present in the patient specimen to prevent non-specific binding of the IgG and
rheumatoid factor to the immobilized VZV antigen. During sample incubation any
antigen specific IgM antibody in the sample will bind to the immobilized antigen.
The plate is washed to remove unbound antibody and other serum components.
2. Peroxidase Conjugated goat anti-human IgM (μ chain specific) is added to the
wells and the plate is incubated. The Conjugate will react with IgM antibody
immobilized on the solid phase in step 1. The wells are washed to remove
unbound Conjugate.
3. The microwells containing immobilized peroxidase Conjugate are incubated with
peroxidase Substrate Solution. Hydrolysis of the Substrate by peroxidase produces
a color change. After a period of time the reaction is stopped and the color
intensity of the solution is measured photometrically. The color intensity of the
solution depends upon the antibody concentration in the original test sample.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was evaluated as outlined in document number
EP5:Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices –
Second Edition, as published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI), Villanova,PA. Reproducibility studies were conducted at all
three sites using the same specimens.
Six specimens were tested; two strong positive specimens, two specimens
close to the cut off optical density and two negative specimens. On each day
of testing, each specimen was assayed in eight replicate wells. This was done
for a total of three days. The following tables summarize the precision testing
conducted at the three sites:

with the high spike of hemoglobin to a low of 83% with the low spike of IgG.
Some elevation of signal in the presence of excess hemoglobin was noted.
The anti-IgG absorbent (SaVE Diluent) has been found to functionally remove
> 13.9 mg/mL IgG from human serum. Patients with an IgG level exceeding
14 mg/mL may require additional treatment to neutralize all IgG. Excessively
high levels of IgG have been shown to reduce reactivity to VZV IgM
antibody.
Cross-Reactivity
A minimum of 10 samples, negative for VZV IgM, were acquired and the
reactivity confirmed using the predicate device. The 10 samples were
subsequently tested for cross-reactivity. In all cases the specimens remained
negative for VZV IgM. Please refer to the data below. All results are
presented as Index Values except where noted.

IgM Destruction
A VZV IgM destruction experiment was performed to assure that the antibody
which is detected by the Zeus Scientific VZV IgM ELISA Test System is
indeed IgM antibody. 2% Mercaptoethanol was the IgM destroying agent
used in this study. Results of the IgM destruction experiment are depicted

The results of the VZV IgM destruction study clearly demonstrate that the
IgM antibody was destroyed, capturing the information that the antibody
detected by the Zeus Scientific VZV IgM ELISA Test System is indeed VZV
IgM antibody.
IgG/RF Effective Removal
The Zeus Scientific VZV IgM ELISA Test System provides sample diluent
which binds IgG and Rheumatoid factor that could potentially cross-react with
immobilized IgM antigen during the assay procedure. The effective
elimination of IgG and rheumatoid factor reactivity in the VZV IgM test
system and specific IgM reactivity is demonstrated in the following table:

f. Assay cut-off:
Establishment and Verification of Cut-off
The cut-off corresponds roughly to the mean plus (X) times the Standard
Deviation of a negative population, X being the multiplication factor
necessary to optimize the assay results. 25 known negative samples,
confirmed by the predicate device were assayed to establish the cut-off.
Additionally, a minimum of 5 known positive samples, also confirmed by the
predicate device were tested. The results of the known positive samples were
ascertained to exceed the theoretical cut-off as well as the negative samples
were ascertained to fall below the theoretical cut-off.

A comparative study was performed to demonstrate the equivalence of the
Zeus Scientific VZV IgM ELISA test system to another VZV IgM ELISA
test system currently in commercial distribution. The performance of the Zeus
Scientific VZV IgM ELISA test system was evaluated in a three-site clinical
investigation. Briefly, there was a total of 338 samples tested: 131 at site one,
53 at site 2 and 154 at site three. Samples at site one were submitted for VZV
antibody testing. Samples at site two included 47 specimens submitted for
routine VZV antibody testing and 6 specimens which were previously
characterized as positive for VZV IgM antibody. Samples at site three
included 124 routine specimens submitted for VZV antibody testing and 30
previously characterized positive specimens. The results of this comparative
study have been summarized in the following tables, one depicting
prospective specimens and one both prospective and retrospective samples:
