L. Test Principle:
The enzyme creatinine amidohydrolase is used to convert creatinine to creatine. The
enzymatic approach to the quantitation of creatine is to use the enzyme creatine
amidinohydrolase, which yields sarcosine and urea, the former being measured with
further enzyme-linked steps using sarcosine oxidase and peroxidase to produce a
colored product.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Total precision was established by assaying three serum controls and three
urine controls in duplicate twice a day for 20 days. The results are
summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Serum linearity was evaluated by measuring 7 serum samples ranging in
concentration from 0.00 to 45.39 mg/dL. All samples were run n=4. Linear
regression analysis was performed resulting in a slope of 1.051 and a y-
intercept of -0.192. The mean recovery of each sample was within ±8% of its
assigned value. The reportable range for serum/plasma samples is from 0.04
to 30 mg/dL.
Urine linearity was evaluated by measuring 9 urine samples ranging in
concentration from 0.01 to 206.78 mg/dL. All samples were run n=4. Linear
regression analysis was performed resulting in a slope of 0.982 and a y-
intercept of 2.274. The mean recovery of each sample was within ±5% of its
assigned value. The reportable range for urine sample is from 0.03 to 175
mg/dL.

d. Detection limit:
The lower limit of quantitation for both serum and urine was determined by
assaying 40 replicates of multiple sample concentrations. This value was
defined as the mean of the lowest sample concentration with a CV of 20% or
lower. The lower limit of detection for serum was 0.03 mg/dL and for urine
was 0.02 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interferences from icterus, lipemia, hemolysis and ascorbic acid were
evaluated for this creatinine method on a Bayer ADVIA 1650 analyzer using a
significance criterion of >10% variance from control. Interference data for
serum and urine was provided. Plasma was expected to be similar to that of
serum.
No significant lipemic interference was found at Intralipid levels from 0-1000
mg/dL (0-3000 mg/dL triglycerides) in a 0.75 mg/dL serum sample and a 31.7
mg/dL urine sample.
No significant hemoglobin intereference was found at hemoglobin levels from
0-1000 mg/dL in 0.79 mg/dL serum sample and a 71.7 mg/dL urine sample.
No significant ascorbic acid interference was found at ascorbic acid levels
from 0-3000 µg/dL in a 0.76 mg/dL serum sample and a 137.4 mg/dL urine
sample.
No significant icteric interference was found at conjugated bilirubin levels
from 0-40 mg/dL in a 95.9 mg/dL urine sample.
No significant icteric interference was found at conjugated bilirubin levels
from 0-40 mg/dL in a 1.08 mg/dL serum sample.
No significant icteric interference was found at unconjugated bilirubin levels
from 0-16 mg/dL in a 0.75 mg/dL serum sample.
