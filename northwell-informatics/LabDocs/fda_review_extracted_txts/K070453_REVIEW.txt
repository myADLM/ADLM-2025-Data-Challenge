reaction mixture when latex particles coated with monoclonal mouse anti-human d-

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was assessed according to CLSI EP5-A2 by testing a low, medium,
and high analyte human plasma pool. 2 runs of duplicates were assayed each
day for 20 days (n=80). All results were within acceptable limits (<10%).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was established based on CLSI Guideline EP6-P2. At least 10 serial
dilutions of a high sample pool was prepared and assayed in quadruplicate.
The mean result of each dilution was plotted against the analyte concentration.
The AU400, AU640, and AU2700 instruments were evaluated and the
Olympus D-Dimer assay system was determined to be linear from 0.15 to 8.00

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Olympus D-Dimer calibrators are bi-level calibrators derived from human
serum. Values are based on an in-house master calibrator that is traceable to a
gravimetric standard and converted from µg/mL to µg FEU/mL. The
assignment value protocol is located in Section 8 of the submission.
The Olympus D-Dimer controls are bi-level controls, and are derived from a
lyophilized human based matrix. Controls values are assigned per lot for each
matched set of reagents, and are based on the mean of ≥8 runs of the control
serum.
d. Detection limit:
An analyte free sample was tested 20X on the AU400, AU640 and AU2700.
The analytical sensitivity was determined to be 0.15 µg FEU/mL by
calculating the absolute mean plus 3 standard deviations.
e. Analytical specificity:
To assess analytical specificity, the mean analytical result of the sample
containing the interferent is compared with that for the non-spiked sample.
The Olympus D-dimer assay demonstrated no significant inference with
Bilirubin (up to 40 mg/dL), hemolysis (up to 500 mg/dL hemoglobin), lipemia
(up to 1000 mg/dL), rheumatoid factor (up to 100 IU/mL) and heparin (up to
1.5 IU/mL).
f. Assay cut-off:
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The Olympus D-dimer assay was compared to the predicate device and
evaluated using linear regression (n=104, y=1.010x + 0.079, r = 0.996). In
addition, the performance of the Olympus D-Dimer assay on the AU640 was
compared to performance of the assay on the AU400 (n=104, y = 1.014 x –
0.029, r = 0.998) and the AU2700 (n = 104, y = 1.020x – 0.037, r=0.997).
b. Matrix comparison:
Matched heparin (y) and citrated samples (x) were tested in single replicates
(n=51) and the results analyzed using linear regression (y= 1.167x + 0.48,
r=0.998).
Although the results demonstrated good correlation, d-dimer concentrations in
citrated samples are generally lower than d-dimer concentrations in
heparinzed samples by 16%. For harmonization a conversion factor of 0.84

for heparin plasma is recommended. This recommendation is reflected in the
device labeling.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
b. Clinical specificity:
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
4. Clinical cut-off:
5. Expected values/Reference range:
151 healthy volunteers were assayed. The reference range was established
following CLSI C28-A2, and was determined to be 0.01 – 0.5 µg FEU/mL
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
a substantial equivalence decision.
