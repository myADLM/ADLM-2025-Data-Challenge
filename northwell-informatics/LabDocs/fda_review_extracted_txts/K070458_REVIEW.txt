cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA) directed against Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and
Serine Proteinase 3 (PR3); and anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM)
antibodies.
The results of the FIDIS™ VASCULITIS* test are to be used in conjunction with
the clinical findings and the other laboratory tests to aid in the diagnosis of
various primary systemic small vessel vasculitis.
The presence of anti-MPO and anti-PR3 antibodies associated primary systemic
small vessel vasculitis: Wegener’s granulomatosis, Churg Strauss syndromes,
microscopic periarteritis and idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis; and the
presence of anti-GBM antibodies is associated with Goodpasture’s syndrome.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle:
FIDIS™ VASCULITIS is based on the use of distinct uniform size color-coded
microspheres and a bench top flow cytometer interfaced to digital signal processing
hardware and software. A red diode laser beam in the flow cytometer classifies each
set of microspheres on the basis of its unique fluorescence intensity (red to orange)
thus identifying which analyte is being tested. At the same time, a green laser beam
illuminates the external second molecule fluorescence to quantify the reaction related
to the specific analyte.
Each antigen required for the assay is covalently coupled to an individual set of
microspheres through its surface functional groups. The different antigen coupled
microspheres are mixed together, constituting the final microspheres reagent.
The test is performed in a 96 wells blank microplate including a filtering membrane at
the bottom of the wells.
• In the first step, the sample is distributed in each well containing the
microspheres mixture. If this sample contains one or more of the suspected
antibodies, this(ese) antibody(ies) bind to the corresponding antigen(s) on the
various sets of microspheres.
After incubation, the unbound antibodies are removed by a wash step using a
•
filtration process.

A phycoerythrin labeled anti-human IgG conjugate is then added that binds to
•
the previously bound antibodies.
A final wash step stops the reaction.
•
The reaction is then directly measured by the flow cytometer, which
•
differentiates each set of microspheres according to its fluorescence color
while simultaneously measures the average fluorescence emitted by the
conjugate.
A calibration system permits the determination of the antibody titer of each
sample by interpolation for each antigenic specificity.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
For the intra-assay study, six samples for MPO, six samples for PR3, seven
samples for GBM (weak, moderate and high titers) were analyzed 10 times
(for each specificity) in one run. For the inter-assay study, the same samples
were analyzed 3 times in 5 different runs. The intra-assay CV ranges for Anti-
MPO, Anti-PR3, and Anti-GBM were: 4.9% to 12.4%; 3.3% to 11.6%; and
2.3% to 11.3% respectively. The inter-assay CV ranges on Anti-MPO, Anti-
PR3, and Anti-GBM were: 5.4% to 11.2%; 10.9% to 19.6%; and 3.8% to
14.6% respectively (see table below).

for PR3. To ensure appropriate samples are used in the test, the package insert
states to avoid grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, microbially contaminated, heat-
treated, specimens with visible particulates, or samples with abnormal
