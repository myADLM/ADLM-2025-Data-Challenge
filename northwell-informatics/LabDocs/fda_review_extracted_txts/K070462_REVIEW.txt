4. Special instrument Requirements:
Gene Xpert® Dx System
I. Device Description:
The Xpert methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Assay system
performs real-time, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of DNA
after an initial sample processing step. In this platform, additional sample preparation,
amplification, and real-time detection are all fully automated and completely integrated.
The assay is performed on a GeneXpert® Dx System, which consists of the GeneXpert
instrument, personal computer, hand-held barcode scanner, and disposable fluidic
cartridges that are designed to complete sample preparation and real-time PCR for
detection of MRSA in about 75 minutes. Each instrument contains 1 to 4 randomly
accessible modules that are capable of performing separate sample preparation and real-
time PCR tests. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids, an ultrasonic
horn for lysing cells or spores, and I-CORE® thermocycler for performing real-time PCR
and detection.
The patented single-use cartridge contain: (1) eleven chambers for holding sample,
reagents, or other materials, (2) a valve body composed of a plunger and syringe barrel,
(3) a rotary valve system for controlling the movement of fluids between chambers, (4)
an area for capturing, concentrating, washing, and lysing spores/cells, (5) dry real-time
PCR reagents, and (6) an integrated PCR reaction tube that can be automatically filled by
the instrument. To eliminate test-to-test contamination, all fluids including amplicons,
are contained within the disposable cartridge. The instrument never comes into contact
with any fluids within the cartridge. Each disposable cartridge is intended to test one
sample. Cartridges are not re-usable.
The Xpert MRSA Assay includes self-contained reagents, including primers and
probes for the simultaneous detection of the target MRSA. Each assay includes a system
control (Probe Check Control) and an internal control (Sample Processing Control). The
Probe Check Control (PCC) verifies bead rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge,
2

--- Page 3 ---
probe integrity, and dye stability. The Sample Processing Control (SPC) is present as a
spore cake in a bead form at a specific concentration of organisms per bead. It is located
in one of the chambers in the Xpert MRSA assay cartridge and is reconstituted by the
eluted specimen before processing. During sample processing, the SPC is co-processed
through all automated steps of the sample preparation procedure, including treatment,
filtration/concentration, washing, ultrasonic lysis, and lysate recovery. It verifies
adequate processing of the target MRSA bacteria and to monitor the presence of
inhibitor(s) in the PCR assay to avoid false–negative results.
A nasal specimen is collected using the Cepheid Sample Collection Device and
transported to the GeneXpert Dx System area. The swab is placed in a tube containing
1.5 mL elution buffer. Following a brief vortexing, the eluted material and two other
reagents are transferred to different chambers of the cartridge. The GeneXpert Dx
System completes sample preparation by mixing the eluted sample with the sample
preparation control and treatment reagents, capturing the bacterial cells on a filter, lysing
the cells using glass beads and an ultrasonic horn, and then eluting the released DNA.
The DNA solution is then mixed with dry PCR reagents and transferred into the PCR
reaction tube for real-time PCR and detection.

L. Test Principle:
The primers and probes in the Xpert MRSA Assay detect the presence of the
staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) inserted into the SA chromosomal attB site.
Nasal swabs are collected and transported to the GeneXpert® System area. The swab is
placed in a tube containing 1.5 mL elution buffer. Following a brief vortexing, the eluted
material and two other liquid reagents are transferred to different chambers of the
cartridge.
The user initiates a test from the system user interface, the instrument signals the user
where to place the cartridge by flashing a green light, and the cartridge is placed into the
indicated module in the GeneXpert® Dx System instrument. The instrument moves the
sample and reagents to and from different chambers within the Xpert MRSA Assay
cartridge. The GeneXpert® Dx System performs sample preparation by mixing the
eluted sample with the sample preparation control and treatment reagents, capturing the
bacterial cells on a filter, lysing the cells using glass beads and ultrasonic horn, then
eluting the released DNA. The DNA solution is then mixed with dry PCR reagents and
transferred into the PCR tube for real-time PCR and detection. The Xpert MRSA Assay
completes sample preparation and real-time PCR in approximately 75 minutes. Internal
controls in Xpert MRSA Assay check key automated steps.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was determined by testing a panel of specimens with
varying concentrations of MRSA and methicillin sensitive
Staphylococcus epidermidis (negative) were tested in triplicate on 10
different days at each of the three sites (4 specimens x 3 times/day x 10
days x 3 sites). One lot of Xpert MRSA kit was used at each of the 3
testing sites.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using two strains of MRSA (type II and type
III) cells serially diluted over 8 orders of magnitude (6.8e7
CFU/swab to 0.68 CFU/swab).
The type II MRSA cells responded linearly (r2 = 0.9982) with
respect to SCCmec detection as a function of MRSA cell input over
7 orders of magnitude (Figure 18-2). The Xpert MRSA Assay was
linear to 6.8 CFU/swab.
The type III MRSA cells responded linearly (r2 = 0.9931) with
respect to SCCmec detection as a function of MRSA cell input over
7 orders of magnitude (Figure 18-3). The Xpert MRSA Assay was
linear to 6.7 CFU/swab.

In addition to the recommended external controls, the Xpert MRSA
assay also includes the Probe Check Control and Sample Processing
Control which were previously addressed under the Device
Description Section.
d. Detection limit (functional sensitivity):
The analytical sensitivity was determined using 6 strains of MRSA
representing the six SCCmec types and subtypes (I, II, III, IV, IVa,
and V). Cultures of these strains were quantified then diluted from
10 to 1000 colony forming units (CFU) per swab and tested in
replicates of 4. Limit of detection obtained for each type or subtype
tested shows the lowest number of CFU/swab at which all 4
replicates were detected and reported positive.
An additional limit of detection or analytical sensitivity study was
performed using MRSA SCCmec type II cells. Replicates of at least
20 each were evaluated at seven concentrations. A cycle threshold
(Ct) was established to determine positivity or negativity for the
target. Results of the study are shown in the table below, which
indicates that the Xpert MRSA will produce a positive result with
95% confidence for a swab containing 80 CFU.
8

--- Page 9 ---
e. Analytical specificity:
The analytical specificity was determined using cultures from 51
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and Network on
Antimicrobial Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (NARSA)
strains representing species phylogenetically related to S. aureus and
members of the nasal commensal flora, 32 strains of methicillin-
sensitive coagulase negative staphylococci, and 12 strains of
methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci. Each isolate
was tested in three replicates at ≥1 x 106 CFU/swab. None of these
isolates were detected by the assay.
Potentially interfering substances evaluated include blood, mucus,
and nasal sprays to relieve decongestion, nasal dryness or irritation.
The presence of these substances did not significantly inhibit PCR
and did not give invalid or erroneous results.
In the investigation study for Xpert MRSA Assay, potential
interfering substances (blood, mucus, or both) were reported on 45
of 1077 (4.2%) nasal swab specimens. Of the 31 specimens that
gave an equivocal result on initial testing, three specimens had
mucus and one specimen had blood on the swab. Three of the four
specimens gave a result on retesting while one that contained mucus
remained indeterminate. Results are summarized in the table below.

--- Page 10 ---
Carry-Over Contamination study consisted of a negative sample
(no MRSA cells spiked onto swabs) processed in the same Gene
Xpert module immediately following a very high positive sample
(1x107 MRSA cells spiked onto swabs). This was repeated 20 times
between 2 Gene Xpert modules for a total of 40 runs. The study
demonstrated no evidence of carry-over contamination.
f. Assay cut-off:
Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed
using the clinical data to verify the 36 cycle threshold (Ct) cut-off
used in the clinical study. This cut-off is supported by data analysis
as the optimal cut-off for the Xpert MRSA Assay.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical trial using nasal swab specimens was performed at seven
institutions by comparing the Xpert MRSA Assay with a second
FDA-cleared nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), and an
enriched culture. Subjects included individuals and medical staff at
risk for nasal colonization. Each subject was enrolled in the study
only one time. Subjects who had received systemic or topical-nasal
antibiotics in the period 48 hours to one week prior to study
enrollment, under 2 years of age had contraindication to nasal swab
collection were excluded from the study. Only those subjects
meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled.
10

--- Page 11 ---
Nasal swabs were collected from each subject. One swab was tested
by the Xpert MRSA Assay and another swab by the 2nd FDA-cleared
NAAT test. The two types of NAAT tests were performed at each
participating institution and an additional swab was sent to a
centralized laboratory for culture testing.
At the centralized laboratory, the swab was directly streaked on to a
selective chromogenic agar plate with cefoxitin and the plate was
incubated for 24-48 hours at 35±2°C. The swab was transferred to
trypticase soy broth (TSB) with 6.5% sodium chloride and incubated
for 18-24 hours at 35±2°C. If the direct streak was negative at 24
hours, the enriched TSB was streaked onto another chromogenic
agar plate with cefoxitin and incubated fro 24-48 hours at 35±2°C.
Confirmation of presumptive positive colonies from either culture
method was performed with a tube coagulase test and Gram stain.
Overall Results
A total of 1077 eligible subjects (one specimen per patient) were
tested for MRSA by Xpert MRSA, and a 2nd FDA-cleared NAAT
test and culture.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
A total of 1077 nasal specimens were collected from 1077 patients at 7
enrolling sites across the United States. The study population was grouped
into subjects in nursing homes or extended stay facilities, hospitalized over 3
days, hospitalized for 3 days or less, out patient clinic and staff or others. The
number and percentage of positive and negative cases relative to the reference
culture method are calculated and presented in the table below.
N. Instrument Name:
GeneXpert Dx system
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The GeneXpert Dx system operates in random access mode and up to four single
use cartridges may be run simultaneously. Up to four GeneXpert Dx Systems
may be linked together, resulting in a total of up to 16 samples processed per
run.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types: Yes _√_ or No ________
The GeneXpert Dx system is the same instrument that is used with the FDA
cleared Cepheid GBS Assay. The software used on the GeneXpert Dx system
for use with the Xpert MRSA Assay is also the same as the Xpert GBS assay
14

--- Page 15 ---
except that the software use for Xpert MRSA Assay is Version 1.6 and software
for Xpert GBS was Version 1.2.
Version 1.6 includes changes for compatibility with the Xpert MRSA Assay,
compatibility with Cepheid’s future assays, and improvements for usability.
Thermal control, optical control, and data handling for version 1.6 are
equivalent to that in version 1.2. Equivalency testing for version 1.2 assays was
performed in version 1.6 software to ensure that the changes did not affect
normal GeneXpert functionality. The Xpert MRSA Assay has been verified and
validated using the Version 1.6 software.
3. Sample Identification:
The software assigns access by predefined user types. The user interface
software is designed with a mouse driven graphical user interface. To perform a
test, the user clicks on the Create Test icon, scans the cartridge barcode, enters
the sample ID barcode, and loads the cartridge into the module to start the test.
An estimated time-to-completion is provided at the beginning of the test. A test
result is provided when the test is completed.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
5. Assay Types:
The GeneXpert Dx Instrument accepts the Xpert MRSA Assay-specific
cartridges that are loaded into the instrument, concentrates bacterial cells, lyses
the samples in the cartridges, releases the nucleic acid, amplifies the target
sequences, and detects the presence of target and controls.

6. Reaction Types:
Not applicable
7. Calibration:
Optical and thermal calibration of the GeneXpert Dx System is performed at the
time of manufacture prior to installation and once yearly or after 1000 runs per
module. The user does not calibrate or perform any serviceable functions on the
instrument. The normalization function compensates for any optical degradation
between calibrations.
8. Quality Control:
Before the start of the PCR reaction, the GeneXpert Dx system is programmed
to perform a probe check on the amplification mixture. The Probe Check
Control (PCC) verifies bead rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe
integrity, and dye stability. The PCC is considered to PASS if it meets the
validated acceptance criteria. If the PCC fails in the MRSA target or Sample
Processing Control (SPC), an error is reported and the test will not continue.
The SPC verifies adequate processing of the target MRSA bacteria. The SPC
PASSES if it meets the validated acceptance criteria. The SPC verifies that lysis
of MRSA has occurred if the bacteria is present and verifies that specimen
processing is adequate. It also monitors the integrity of the PCR assay,
including sample inhibition.
External controls may be obtained commercially and may be used in accordance
with local, state, or federal accrediting organizations as applicable.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered in
