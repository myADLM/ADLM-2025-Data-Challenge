M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The cut-off of the test is 10 mIU/mL. Seven control solutions (pooled urine
samples from males and females) were created with target FSH concentrations
of 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, and 25 mIU/mL using a WHO 78/549 determined
reference solution. Each solution was then run one time on the QuantRx
Female Fertility Test for ten consecutive days. The results were as follows:
Test Solution Normal Elevated

The sponsor provided data from a study of urine and serum samples taken
from 40 female subjects to demonstrate performance around the cut-off. The
results from professionals testing the device were as follows:

Elevated 2 0 2 8
Normal 23 4 0 1
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The test is calibrated against the WHO 2nd IRP 78/549 of FSH.
d. Detection limit:
Seven control solutions (pooled urine from males and females) were created
with target FSH concentrations of 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, and 25 mIU/mL
using a WHO 78/549 determined reference solution. The QuantRx Female
Fertility Test was assayed one time on ten consecutive days using each
solution. The strips were removed and digitally photographed, then
quantitated using Adobe Photoshop. A dose response curve was calculated
from the means of each concentration. The lower limit of detection (LLD) was
calculated from the SD around the 2.5 mIU/mL calibrator. The 95%
confidence interval (2SD from the zero value) was used to determine the LLD
from the standard fit to the curve. That value was calculated to be 0.6
mIU/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
To determine potential cross-reactivity, the QuantRx Female Fertility Test
was analyzed using solutions with FSH 50% above or 50% below the assay
threshold of 10 mIU/mL and spiked with high physiological concentrations of
luteinizing hormone (LH), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and thyroid
stimulating hormone (TSH). The results showed no cross-reactivity from TSH
at 20 μIU/mL or LH at 100 mIU/mL. High levels of hCG (up to 100,000
mIU/mL) were not cross reactive (e.g., did not produce a test line signal).
However, negative interference of a positive FSH signal was observed at high
hCG levels. This was addressed with a limitation in the labeling about
inaccurate results being obtained during pregnancy.

In addition to the hormones listed above, the QuantRx Female Fertility Test
was tested for interference using solutions with FSH 50% above or 50%
below the assay threshold of 10 mIU/mL and spiked with the following
compounds at a level 100 μg/mL: ascorbic acid, acetaminophen, albumin,
bilirubin, caffeine, glucose, hemoglobin, and serum protein. No interference
was observed.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A comparison study was conducted to demonstrate concordance between
results from the proposed device and an legally marketed serum FSH device.
A total of 40 peri-menopausal age women (35 to 50 years old) were recruited.
Each of the test subjects collected their own urine and conducted testing on
the proposed device, using the dip method as described in the labeling. The
urine specimens were subsequently tested by professionals. Upon completion
of the urine testing, each subject provided a matching blood sample which
was analyzed on the serum FSH device. The results of the consumer and
professional analyses of the proposed device and corresponding serum results,
which ranged from 1.9 to 96.1 mIU/mL, are shown in the following tables:
Professional Elevated Positive Normal Negative
≥10 mIU/mL Agreement <10 mIU/mL Agreement
QuantRx™ 10 91% 27 93%
Serum FSH 11 29
Consumer Elevated Positive Normal Negative
≥10 mIU/mL Agreement <10 mIU/mL Agreement
QuantRx™ 9 81% 27 93%
Serum FSH 11 29
Supplemental testing was performed using eight spiked solutions around the
cutoff. The solutions were created from a WHO FSH standard, targeted to 8.0
mIU/mL and 12.0 mIU/mL, and blind labeled. The solutions were then
analyzed on the proposed device by eight consumers and subsequently tested
by a professional. All twelve specimens (four clinical and eight contrived) that
fell within the ± 20% of the cutoff were correctly interpreted by the
consumers and professional. The results of the consumer and professional
analyses of the proposed device and corresponding serum results or spiked

Another comparison study was conducted to demonstrate concordance
between the results from the proposed device performed by professionals and
a quantitative FSH laboratory device. A total of 69 fresh urine specimens and
140 blinded, coded specimens were used in the study. The fresh urine
specimens represented various stages of each subject’s cycle including day 3
of menses and were found to range from <0.3 to 122.8 mIU/mL. The coded
specimens were banked urine specimens of known FSH concentration ranging
from 1.4 to 17.3 mIU/mL. The results were as follows:

a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
A study was conducted to demonstrate the ability of lay persons to correctly
interpret the test results compared with the results from a quantitative,
laboratory FSH method. A total of 209 female subjects representing various
demographics participated. Sixty-nine (69) of the subjects conducted testing
using their own specimens via the midstream procedure and provided a urine
sample for quantitation. The remaining 140 subjects were provided blinded
urine specimens of previously determined FSH concentrations and conducted
the testing using the dip procedure.
Fifteen (15) of the proposed devices used in this study were modified to
mimic invalid test results. This was accomplished by removing the conjugate
pad located between the sample wick and the nitrocellulose membrane. All 15
subjects given the modified devices correctly interpreted the results as invalid
and were given another device to repeat testing. The replacement devices were
unmodified and produced valid results. The results from the consumer study,
including those from the consumer questionnaire, are below.
Elevated Positive Normal Negative
≥10 mIU/mL Agreement <10 mIU/mL Agreement
Consumers 54 70% 130 98%
Comparator 77 132
FSH Lab
Method
The overall agreement between the new device (when tested by consumers)
and the comparative lab FSH device is 88%.
The consumer questionnaire results showed that out of 191 consumers, 100%
thought the written instructions were clear and easy to follow. Also, 100% felt
the new test was easy to perform.
The results of a comparison of the consumer performing the test versus the
professional performing the test are shown below:

The results demonstrate that the performance of the QuantRx Female Fertility
Test in the hands of the lay user is comparable to the performance in the hands
of a trained professional.

The expected values are based on literature.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
