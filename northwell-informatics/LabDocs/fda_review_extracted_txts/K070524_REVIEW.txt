I. Device Description:
The microdot Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the microdot Blood Glucose
Meter, microdot Test Strips, microdot Control Solutions and a commercially available
lancing device and lancets.
Each lot of test strips is calibrated to give plasma equivalent glucose readings. The
calibration code is printed on the vial of strips and is entered into the meter manually by
using the meter buttons. The meter is turned on by strip insertion, the user applies a drop of
blood or control solution to the test strip and the meter starts the measurement. After 10
seconds, the meter displays the glucose concentration and time and date on the LCD display.

L. Test Principle:
The test is base on the enzymatic conversion of glucose. Glucose dehydrogenase converts
glucose in the sample to gluconolactone, with concomitant reduction of the enzyme cofactor
NAD+ to NADH. The NADH is re-oxidised to NAD+ by the mediator compound which in
turn becomes reduced; re-oxidation of the mediator by the meter induces a micro current to
flow, and the size of this micro current is directly proportional to the amount of glucose in
the sample.

was spiked with glucose to achieve 5 levels of glucose concentration. The low
glucose concentration was obtained by allowing the whole blood to glycolyse until
the required concentration was reached. Twenty replicate glucose measurements were
carried out for each concentration in one day. Results are summarized in the table

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range of the assay is from 20 mg/dL to 525 mg/dL. The linearity
study measured spiked whole blood samples with the microdot device using two test
strip batches and the YSI analyzer. A linear regression was performed resulting in a
slope of 0.946 (r2 = 0.997) for batch 5L1091 and a slope of 0.940 (r2 = 0.994) for
batch 5L2001. Additional samples were performed in a second study to verify
performance at concentrations down to 20 mg/dL and showed no bias between the
microdot device and the YSI analyzer results.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The control solutions are prepared at three target concentrations by gravimetric
addition of glucose to an aqueous matrix. The glucose concentration of the control
solutions are verified with the YSI reference method.

Expected values for the control solutions are verified for each manufactured lot of
strips.
Shelf life studies show that the unopened test strips have a 24 month life-span and 3
months shelf-life once a vial of strips is opened. Unopened controls have a 24-month
shelf life and are stable for 3 months after first use.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit is 20 mg/dL. Measurement of samples down to 20 mg/dL showed
no bias between the microdot device and the YSI analyzer results. See linearity/assay
reportable range section above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Effect of hematocrit over the range of 30 to 50% was tested at nominal glucose
concentrations of 30, 60, 150, and 400 mg/dL. Testing was performed with two strip
batches and each sample was measured n=6 with each test strip batch and compared
to the YSI value for the samples (YSI showed no bias due to hematocrit). The results
are summarized below:

Common interferences were evaluated by spiking venous blood with glucose to two
concentrations. Each of these glucose concentrations was then spiked with the
interfering compound at two concentrations to make the interference samples.
Control samples were each spiked with the solvents used to make the interfering
samples. No Interference effects were observed from the common interfering
compounds shown below. No interference was defined as a bias of ≥15% between
the interfering sample and the control sample.
Acetaminophen- up to 20 mg/dL
Ascorbic acid – up to 3 mg/dL
Dopamine – up to 13 mg/dL
Triglycerides- up to 3000 mg/dL
Cholesterol – up to 500 mg/dL
Bilirubin – up to 20 mg/dL
Uric acid – up to 20 mg/dL
Tolbutamide – up to 100 mg/dL

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison study was performed with 121 capillary fingerstick patient
samples. In order to fully cover the measuring range, 19 of the samples were spiked
with glucose or allowed to glycolyze. The samples ranged in concentration from 36
to 473 mg/dL on the microdot device and met the ISO 15197 sample distribution
requirements. Samples were measured in singlicate on the microdot meter and in
duplicate on the YSI analyzer. An analysis of the results calculated a slope of 1.006,
an intercept of 0.778, and an R2 value of 0.9644. In addition, 98% of the results were
within the ISO 15197:2003 accuracy criteria of 95% of samples with ±15 mg/dL bias
for glucose samples ≤ 75 mg/dL and ±20% bias for glucose samples >75 mg/dL.

N. Instrument Name:
Microdot Blood Glucose Meter
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for each additional
reading.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
10

--- Page 11 ---
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger only. Since
the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip, there are no special handling
or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
The meter automatically detects the code number when a test strip is inserted. The user
must check to see if the code number the meter displays matches the number on the test
strip vial. If the number matches, the user is instructed to begin testing. If the number
does not match, or if no number appears, the user is instructed how to manually enter the
correct code number. No other calibration is required from the user.
6. Quality Control:
One control level is provided with the device. Two additional control levels are available
from authorized distributors. The user is instructed to run controls when the meter is first
used in order to verify that they can use the meter correctly. In addition they are
instructed to run a control when a new vial of test strips is opened, at least once a week,
when they suspect the meter or strips are not working correctly, when test results are not
consistent with the patient’s symptoms or the patient does not think the results are
accurate, or if the meter is dropped. The acceptable results ranges are shown on the test
strip vial label. If the results are outside the expected range, the user is instructed to
repeat the test. If the results continue to fall outside the expected range, the user is
instructed to call customer service.
