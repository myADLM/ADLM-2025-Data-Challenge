H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use statement below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The ISE module of the DataPro™ Plus Clinical Chemistry Analyzer is intended for the
quantitative determination of sodium, potassium and chloride in serum, using ion-
selective (ISE) electrodes.
Sodium: Disorders of the sodium ion (Na+) can be caused by excessive loss, gain or
retention of Na+ or excessive retention of water. Low Na+ can be associated with renal
failure, congestive heart failure and cirrhosis. An increase in Na+ is seen in neurological
disorders such as tremors, ataxia, confusion and coma.
Potassium: Disturbances of potassium (K+ ) homeostasis has serious consequences and
can lead to tachycardia when low. When high, respiratory weakness peripheral vascular
collapse and cardiac arrest is evident. It is also seen in conditions associated with
Addison’s disease. Levels higher than 10mmol/L are fatal in most cases.
Chloride: When the chloride ion (Cl- ) is unbalanced in the serum, it is usually a sign of
an underlying disturbance in fluid and acid-base homeostasis. A low Cl- concentration is
observed in individuals with salt-losing nephritis whereas an increase in Cl- can indicate
acute renal failure and metabolic acidosis.
The ISE module, and all of the reagents included in this test system are for in vitro
diagnostic use only.

reference electrode at the ion selective membrane. This is done by means of the ion selective
membrane which develops a potential with respect to reference electrode.

N. Instrument Name:
DataPro Plus Clinical Chemistry Analyzer
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The DataPro Plus Clinical Chemistry Analyzer is intended to be used a traditional clinical
laboratory setting. The analyzer performs various modes: end point with sample blank,
fast and two-point kinetics (0 and 1st order), turbidimetric and potentiometric ISE. The
device is used for single sample testing.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
A bar code option is available.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Pressurized standards are delivered to the electrodes. The DataPro ISE module for
sodium, potassium and chlorine utilizes a permeable membrane that is specific for each
ion of interest in the sample solution. An electrical potential is developed according to
the Nernst equation for a specific ion. When compared to a reference solution this
electrical potential is translated into voltage and then into the ion concentration of the
sample solution.
5. Calibration:
Uses factor, standard or calibration curves with two (up to ten) standards with automatic
curve adjust. A one or two point calibration is performed at the end of every sample.
ISE calibrations do not require operator action as they are automatically performed.

6. Quality Control:
In the labeling the sponsor recommends that normal and abnormal control serum of
known concentrations of sodium, potassium and chloride should be analyzed routinely
with each group of unknown samples.
• Levy Jennings plots, Westgard rules.
• Data import and export to other programs and/or remote terminals..
• Automatic backup protection.

“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
