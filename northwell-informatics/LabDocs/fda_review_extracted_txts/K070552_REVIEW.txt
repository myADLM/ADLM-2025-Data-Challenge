EP5-A2, CLSI Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples;
Approved Guideline EP9-A2, CLSI Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry;
Approved Guideline EP7-A2. CLSI Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative
Analytical Methods; Approved Guideline EP6-A.
L. Test Principle:
The FERR method is a homogenous, sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay.
Ferritin in a sample is incubated with biotinylated murine monoclonal and beads that
are coated with anti-ferritin mouse monoclonal and containing a chemiluminescent
dye (Chemibeads) to form a particle/ferritin/biotin-antibody sandwich. A second set
of beads (Sensibeads), coated with streptavidin and containing a photosensitizer dye
is added and bind to the biotin to form bead-pair immunocomplexes. The sample is
illuminated at 680nm, generating a single oxygen from the Sensibeads that diffuses
into the Chemibeads and triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal
is measured at 612 nm and is a direct indication of the ferritin concentration in the
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was done in accordance with CLSI Approved Guideline
EP5-A2. Three serum pools and one plasma sample representing the
measuring range were analyzed in duplicate, twice a day, for 20 days. Two
commercially available controls were also evaluated. The standard deviation
(SD) and coefficient of variation (%CV) for repeatability and within-lab
precision are reported below. Overall repeatability was greater than 98% and
within-lab reproducibility was greater than 96%.

The linear range of the assay (0.5 – 2000 ng/mL) was confirmed by testing
five replicates of each dilution (7 total) prepared from a patient serum sample,
as described in CLSI protocol EP-6-A. Ferritin concentrations in the sample
ranged from 0.0 to 2136.6 ng/mL. The mean of the observed values for each
dilution were plotted versus the expected values. Least squares regression
analysis generated the following data:
Slope Y-intercept Correlation Coefficient n
(ng/mL)
1.00 2.1 ng/mL 1.00 35
Recovery studies were also performed using six serum samples with ferritin
concentrations ranging from 4.5 - 151 ng/mL. Samples were spiked with 10
ng/mL of ferritin. The percent recovery ranged from 87% to 104% with a
mean recovery of 95%.
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
Value assignments for the calibrators are made from a master pool that is
referenced to the WHO standard for ferritin 3rd IS 94/572.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank was determined from the mean of 20 replicates of the zero-
level calibrator plus 2 standard deviations. The value obtained was 0.13
ng/mL. The limit of blank claim is 0.5 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Interference studies: Interference testing was performed according to CLSI
Approved Guideline EP7-A2 to determine the effect of various exogenous
substances of the Dimension Vista™ FERR method. Minimal
interference (<10%) was observed when pooled human serum samples
representing two concentrations of ferritin (20 ng/mL and 502.7 ng/mL)
containing the following interferents were compared to a control without
interferent: hemoglobin (500 mg/dL), unconjugated bilirubin (20 mg/dL),
conjugated bilirubin (60 mg/dL), Intralipid (3000 mg/dL) rheumatoid
factor (510 IU/mL). An additional panel of 41 exogenous substances were
evaluated for interference and were shown to exhibit minimal interference
(<10%).
ii. Cross-reactivity
Not applicable.
iii. Antigen excess- The effect of antigen excess in the Dimension Vista™
FERR assay was evaluated using the zero-level calibrator spiked with
250,000 ng/mL of human ferritin. The test result was reported as “exceeds
assay range.” Samples greater than 2000 ng/mL are reported as exceeding
assay range.
f. Assay cut-off:
See Expected values/reference range.

CLSI Approved Guideline for Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using
Patient Samples; EP9-A2 was followed. The Dimension Vista™ FERR
method on the Dimension Vista™ System was compared to the predicate
Dimension® Ferritin Flex® reagent cartridge on the Dimension® RxL
instrument by assaying 158 serum samples with concentrations ranging from
4.4 ng/mL to 1573.3 ng/mL on both systems and comparing the results.
Ordinary least squares linear regression statistics are as follows:
Comparative Slope Y- Correlation N
Method Intercept coefficient

Dimension 1.01 1.48ng/mL 0.996 158
RxL System
Passing-Bablok non-parametric linear regression analysis yielded the
following statistics: Slope 1.02 (95% CI: 1.00 to 1.03), Y-intercept -0.95 (95%
CI -1.81 to -0.47).
b. Matrix comparison:
Ten matched serum, Na-heparin plasma, Li-heparin plasma, EDTA-plasma
samples containing ferritin concentrations ranging 5.3 -1978.5 ng/mL, were
assayed and compared. Least squared regression analysis demonstrated that
there was no significant bias between the two matrices and yielded the
following statistics:
Sample type Slope Y-intercept Correlation
compared to serum coefficient
Na-heparin plasma 1.03 -2.1 1.00
Li-heparin plasma 1.01 -4.0 1.00
EDTA-plasma 1.00 1.00 -4.6 1.00

a. Clinical sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a and b are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
See Expected values/reference range
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The reference intervals were transferred from those previously obtained using the
predicate Dimension® system. They represent the central 95% of results
determined from a population of healthy adults (n=296; 118 males, and 178
females). The original determination and transference were done in accordance
with protocol CLSI C28-A2, How to Define and Determine Reference Intervals in
the Clinical Laboratory. Pediatric samples were not evaluated.
