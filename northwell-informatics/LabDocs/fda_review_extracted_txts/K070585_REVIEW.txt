The ACCU-CHEK Performa system is designed to quantitatively measure the
concentration of glucose for monitoring glucose in the home or in health care
facilities. Testing sites include traditional fingertip site along with palm, forearm,
upper arm, thigh, and calf.
Professionals may use the test strips to test capillary, venous, arterial, and
neonatal blood; home use is limited to capillary whole blood testing.

This device is intended for use with whole blood but produces plasma equivalent
glucose results.
3. Special instrument requirements:
ACCU-CHECK Performa Blood Glucose Meter
I. Device Description:
The ACCU-CHEK Performa system starter kit includes the glucose meter with
battery, test strips with a code key, and the lancing device with lancets. Control
solutions are available but will be sold separately. The test strips, lancing device, and
lancets may also be sold separately.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Roche Diagnostics Corporation ACCU-CHEK Aviva Blood Glucose Meter
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s) and device history:
The Roche Aviva glucose meter was initially cleared under k043474 for
consumer (OTC) and professional use. Cleared matrices were venous or capillary
whole blood with consumer use limited to fingerstick capillary blood. The meter
was also cleared for alternate site testing from the palm, forearm, upper arm,
thigh, and calf.
The Aviva meter was submitted again under k060620 for the addition of arterial,
neonatal capillary, and neonatal cord blood as acceptable matrices. The
hematocrit range of the meter to was also extended to 10 – 70%.

reaction liberates an electron that reacts with a coenzyme electron acceptor, the
oxidized form of the mediator hexacyanoferrate (III), forming the reduced form of the
mediator hexacyanoferrate (III). The test strip employs the
electrochemical principle of biamperometry. The meter applies a voltage between two
identical electrodes, which causes the reduced mediator formed during the incubation
period to be reconverted to an oxidized mediator. This generates a small current that
is read by the meter and reported as the glucose result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Performance testing studies were done to evaluate the modifications to the meter.
Some performance parameters were reviewed in the predicate device submissions.
See k043474 and k060620 for additional information on device performance
evaluations.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated the between-lot and between-day imprecision of the
device using replicate measurements of glucose linearity solutions. Data was
collected over 10 days using 10 meters and 3 strip lots. For glucose values ≤
75 mg/dL, the sponsor calculated the standard deviation and for values > 75
mg/dL the coefficient of variation was calculated:

Linearity Mean
Standard Coefficient of
Sample (mg/dL)
Deviation Variation
Low 50.7 1.8 --
Medium 121.3 -- 2.3
High 301.4 -- 1.9
The sponsor also evaluated the within-run imprecision of the device using
control solutions and venous blood. Results were as follows:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was established under k043474. The reportable range of the meter
is 10 – 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected va lues (controls, calibrators, or methods)
Controls were previously cleared under k043474
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit was established under k043474
e. Analytical specificity:
Studies to establish the analytical specificity were conducted under k043474
and k060620. The sponsor also retested a subset of compounds for potential
interference with the Performa system.
The following list will be included in the package insert as limitations for their
potential to cause falsely elevated glucose results:
• Icodextrin (found in peritoneal dialysis solutions)
• Galactose
• Maltose
• Xylose
• Triglycerides (lipidemia)
f. Assay cutoff:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
For capillary blood samples, the sponsor performed two method comparison
studies, one with consumers using the device and the other with lab
professionals using the device. Only fingertip capillary samples were tested.
For device performance with capillary samples from alternate sites, see

N. Instrument Name:
Roche Diagnostics Corporation ACCU-CHEK Performa Blood Glucose Meter
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional
readings.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
For consumers, this device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from
the finger, palm, forearm, upper arm, thigh, and calf. Professionals may use the
test strips to test capillary, venous, arterial, and neonatal blood. When venous or
arterial blood is tested, samples must be anticoagulated with heparin or EDTA
and analyzed within 30 minutes.
5. Calibration:
A Code Key is provided with each box of test strips to calibrate the meter for that
strip lot. No further calibrations are required of the user.

--- Page 9 ---
6. Quality Control:
High and low glucose control solutions are provided separately and were cleared
under k043474. After the user marks the control sample as Low or High, the
meter checks the value automatically based on the lot number of the strips. If the
control result is out of range, an “Err” error message is displayed. Should this
occur, the user is referred to the Troubleshooting Checks section of the User’s
Manual. The user can also compare the result to the control range printed on the
strip vial.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics:
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
