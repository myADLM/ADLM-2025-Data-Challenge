L. Test Principle:
The analysis sequence is the same for each of the three tests. After extracted and purified
DNA, mixed with hybridization buffer, is loaded into the sample well of the test cartridge, it
is ready for processing. An internal barcode reader reads the cartridge ID and sends the
information to the Verigene® Reader. The reader establishes the hybridization parameters
and starts the hybridization process.
The genotyping process occurs with a hybridization of the target analyze to a synthetic gene-
specific oligonucleotide capture strand on the test cartridge’s substrate. A synthetic mediator
target–specific oligonucleotide is included with the test-specific sample buffer to form a
hybridization” sandwich” with the gene sequence of interest. After washing, a probe
composed of a gold nanoparticle with covalently bound oligonucleotide complementary to a
sequence on the intermediate oligonucleotide, is introduced. A signal enhancement reagent is
added to the hybridization chamber and reacts with the gold nanoparticle to amplify the
signal for the Verigene® Reader scanning and analysis.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

contaminating sample’s genotype was: F2 (mutant); F5 (wild-type); MTHFR (hetero).
The percent contaminating sample ranged from 0-50%. The results indicated that
neither the call rate nor accuracy in a homozygous sample was affected in the
presence of up to 10% contamination by volume of a sample with the opposite
homozygous genotype. At least 20% contamination by volume of a sample with a
heterozygous genotype is required to affect the call rate.
A study was performed to assess the interference of heparin, hemoglobin or magnetic
beads in a purified DNA sample. Interference was observed in the 5X magnetic bead
sample where the F5 signal was slightly lower than the control. The genotyping
ration results showed slight variations but none led to an increase in no-calls or a mis-
call.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Accuracy (percent agreement) was determined by comparison to bi-directional DNA
sequencing:
A total of 287 samples, sixty-eight percent (68%) from patients undergoing “rule-out
thrombophilia” testing, were analyzed at three sites using the Verigene® F5 / F2 /
MTHFR Nucleic Acid Tests and by bi-directional sequencing analysis at an
independent reference laboratory. All purified DNA samples were from whole blood
collected using EDTA as the anticoagulant. Data comparison details for F5, F2, and
MTHFR are shown in tables 3-5 below:

*Two DNA samples did not return complete bi-directional sequencing results and,
therefore, were excluded from the data. Specifically, one sample did not produce
results for any genotype reads (i.e., F2, F5, and MTHFR) and one sample returned no
results for the F2 genotype. These four genotype reads represent 0.7% of the total
possible calls in the method comparison study. There were no samples excluded due
to discrepancies between sequenced results.
The Verigene® F5 / F2 / MTHFR Nucleic Acid Tests demonstrated 100% Positive
Percent Agreement (95%CI=98.9 to 100.0%) and 100% Negative Percent Agreement
(95%CI=98.9 to 100.0%) in these studies based on data from calls made.
