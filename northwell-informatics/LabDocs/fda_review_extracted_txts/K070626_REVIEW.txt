--- Page 2 ---
2. Indication(s) for use:
High Sensitivity Cardiac C-Reactive Protein (CRPH) Reagent, when used in conjunction
with Synchron LX PRO System, UniCel DxC 600/800 System(s) and Synchron Systems
CAL 5 Plus, is intended for the quantitative determination of C-Reactive protein (CRP)
in human serum or plasma by rate turbidimetry.
Measurement of C-Reactive protein (CRP) aids in evaluation of stress, trauma, infection,
inflammation, surgery and associated diseases. Cardiac CRP assays are indicated for use
as an aid in the identification and stratification of individuals at risk for future
cardiovascular disease. When used in conjunction with traditional clinical laboratory
evaluation of acute coronary syndromes, CRP may be useful as an independent marker of
prognosis for recurrent events in patients with stable coronary disease or acute coronary
syndrome.

3. CLSI Guideline, EP9-A2 Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples;
Approved Guideline Second edition
L. Test Principle:
Synchron Ssystems High Sensitivity Cardiac CRP is based on the highly sensitive near
infared particle immunoassay rate methodology. An anti-CRP antibody-coated particle binds
to CRP in the patient sample resulting in the formation of insoluble aggregates causing
turbidity.
The chemical reaction scheme is as follows:
C-reactive protein (sample) + Particle bound anti-CRP (antibody)
[C-reactive protein (sample)-antibody complex]
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run and total imprecision studies were designed using CLSI EP5-A2 guideline.
Three levels of serum based controls were run twice a day, in duplicate, for 20 days on
the UniCel DxC system. Mean, SD, and % CV are calculated and shown in the tables
below:
Within-run imprecision
Sample N Mean (mg/L) SD (mg/L) % CV
Level 1 80 0.630 0.019 3.1
Level 2 80 13.68 0.222 1.6
Level 3 80 56.39 0.907 1.6
Total imprecision
Sample N Mean (mg/L) SD (mg/L) % CV
Level 1 80 0.630 0.033 5.3
Level 2 80 13.68 0.381 2.8
Level 3 80 56.39 1.823 3.2
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
i.) The linearity study was designed using the CLSI EP6-A guideline. Serial dilutions
of high serum samples were used on the Synchron LX20 PRO system for this study.

[Table 1 on page 5]
Sample	N	Mean (mg/L)	SD (mg/L)	% CV
Level 1	80	0.630	0.019	3.1
Level 2	80	13.68	0.222	1.6
Level 3	80	56.39	0.907	1.6

[Table 2 on page 5]
Sample	N	Mean (mg/L)	SD (mg/L)	% CV
Level 1	80	0.630	0.033	5.3
Level 2	80	13.68	0.381	2.8
Level 3	80	56.39	1.823	3.2

--- Page 6 ---
The linear regression of the correlation was as follows:
Y= 1.0051 X + 0.1415, r2 = 0.9977
A low sample with concentration of 13.6 mg/L with serial dilutions was also tested to
show the low end linearity and the linear regression was as follows:
Y= 0.9861 X + 0.0941, r2 = 0.9993
The sponsor claimed a linear range of 0.2 to 80.0 mg/L.
ii.) A dilution study was done to verify the extended range on the candidate device.
Seventeen (17) serum samples with different CRP concentrations were tested on the
Synchron LX20 PRO system using the Synchron Systems Cardiac High Sensitivity
CRPH Reagent (candidate) and the Synchron Systems High Sensitivity CRPH
Reagent (predicate). The results demonstrated that the two assays agreed within ±
15%. The sponsor claimed that the extended (ORDAC) range is 60.0 to 380.0 mg/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Synchron Systems Cardiac High Sensitivity CRPH Reagent is traceable to CRM 470
reference materials.
d. Detection limit:
i.) An analytical sensitivity (limit of blank) study was performed using several low
standards and the Synchron LX 20 PRO System. Analytical sensitivity was defined as
the lowest measurable concentration which can be distinguished from zero with 95%
confidence. The standards were run in 20 replicates and the mean and SD was
calculated based on the observed results. The sponsor claimed that the analytical
sensitivity of the candidate device is 0.11 mg/L.
ii.) A functional sensitivity (limit of quantitation) study was performed using serum
samples and the UniCel DxC System. The functional sensitivity was defined as the
lowest concentration that can be measured with an inter-assay CV of 20%. Six
serum samples with different CRP concentrations were run in duplicates of 10 and
the mean and SD were calculated based on the observed results. The sponsor claimed
that the functional sensitivity of the candidate device is 0.18mg/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was not repeated and remained unchanged as the previously
cleared predicate device, Synchron Systems High Sensitivity CRP (k010597)
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable
2. Comparison studies:

--- Page 7 ---
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were designed using CLSI EP9-A as a guideline and
employed Deming regression analysis to analyze the data. The correlation test
results were obtained using the Dade Behring CardioPhase High Sensitivity CRP
(predicate) on the BN System and the Synchron System High Sensitivity Cardiac
CRPH reagent (candidate) on the UniCel DxC System. 269 serum patient samples
ranging from 0.2 to 80.0 mg/L were utilized for this study and no samples were
diluted or fortified. The Deming regression correlation is as follows:
Y= 1.048 X + 0.024, r = 0.9899
A separate regression was calculated for samples ranging from 0.2 to 10 mg/L
(cardiac range) and Deming regression correlation is as follows:
Y = 1.030 – 0.008, r = 0.9910, N = 149.
(Y= candidate device, X = predicate device)
b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison studies using 47 healthy individuals with paired serum, EDTA,
Lithium Heparin and Sodium Heparin were analyzed using the Synchron System
High Sensitivity Cardiac CRPH reagent (candidate) on the Synchron LX 20 PRO
System. Samples ranged from 0.221 to 23.9 mg/L. Deming regression analysis was
used to evaluate the results.
For serum vs Sodium heparin plasma: Y= 0.984 X + 0.049, r = 0.9997
For serum vs Lithium heparin plasma: Y= 1.017X - 0.012, r = 0.9998
For serum vs EDTA plasma: Y= 0.982 X + 0.021, r = 0.9999
(X = serum results)
