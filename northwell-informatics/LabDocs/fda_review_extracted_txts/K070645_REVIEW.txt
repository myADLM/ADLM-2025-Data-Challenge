K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI (formerly NCCLS) guideline EP5-A2: Evaluation of Precision Performance of
Quantitative Measurement Methods.
CLSI (formerly NCCLS) guideline EP6-A: Evaluation of the Linearity of
Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach.
CLSI (formerly NCCLS) Guideline EP7-A2: Interference Testing in Clinical
Chemistry.

Estimation Using Patient Samples
L. Test Principle:
The assay is a homogeneous particle-enhanced turbidimetric assay, based on antibody
binding competition between topiramate in the sample and microparticle-bound
topiramate.
Antibody binding causes microparticle agglutination. The rate of absorbance change,
measured spectrophotometrically, is proportional to the rate of agglutination, and is
converted to concentration in µg/mL.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Performance was validated on a Hitachi 917 chemistry analyzer.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed using the CLSI guideline EP5-A2.
The previously cleared topiramate controls (tri-level, human serum based)
were assayed on the Hitachi 917. Measurements were taken in duplicate,
twice a day, with a minimum of two hours difference for 20 non-consecutive
days, giving 80 measurements per control level. Data was collected on two
Hitachi 917’s using nine calibrations. Within run, between day, and total
imprecision was calculated:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity by dilution was evaluated based on the CLSI guideline EP6-A.
A high topiramate patient pool was made by combining three patient samples
of high therapeutic levels. Because the patient pool topiramate concentration
was not sufficiently high, it was supplemented (<10% total volume) with a
topiramate stock solution in order to attain a concentration 20-30% above the
desired reportable range (~40 µg/mL). The pool was then diluted with
Calibrator A to achieve the desired concentrations which were analyzed in
triplicate. Results are summarized below:

The difference between the calculated and observed concentrations for all
levels was 7% or less.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrators and controls were previously cleared under k970509 and
k970517, respectively.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor defined the Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) as the lowest
concentration at which the inter-assay precision is ≤ 20% CV, with a recovery
of ± 15%.

Test samples were prepared using a patient specimen at the low end of the
therapeutic concentration range. This sample was diluted with Cal A to
produce concentrations from 0.11 to 1.69 µg/mL. The samples were run on
each of two Hitachi 917’s every day for five days, for a total of n = 20 for
each level. The grand mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation
were calculated for each test sample.
Based upon this study, the sponsor claims an LOQ of 1.50 µg/mL in the
package insert.
e. Analytical specificity:
Topiramate metabolites. The sponsor provided two studies from the
medical literature which detected low concentrations of topiramate
metabolites in plasma from a total of 23 subjects.
The sponsor also performed a study using 9-Hydroxytopiramate, which is one
of the major metabolites of topiramate. This compound was tested at
concentrations of 4, 8 and 32 µg/mL in serum containing both low and high
topiramate concentrations. The concentrations of 9-Hydroxytopiramate
tested were significantly higher than those measured in the studies from the
medical literature. The following results were observed:

f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A study was conducted according to CLSI Guideline EP9-A2 comparing
results obtained by the QMS® Topiramate assay to that of the predicate
Innofluor® Topiramate assay. Samples tested were from patients whose
topiramate level are being monitored and routinely sent to a well established
laboratory for analysis. Samples ranging from 1.56 to 30.72 µg/mL topiramate
were tested using both the Innofluor Topiramate assay on TDx and the QMS
Topiramate assay on Hitachi 917. The analysis for each method was separated
by no more than 2 hours. The data collected contained no outliers and was
analyzed in singlet. Results for the Innofluor TDx reference method were
plotted against those for the QMS Hitachi 917 method. Results below the
LOQ of the QMS Hitachi 917 assay were not plotted or used in the statistical

analysis. The linear regression statistics and graphical presentation are as
follows:
n = 148
Slope = 0.962
y-intercept = 0.228
R² = 0.986
b. Matrix comparison:
This assay can be run using either serum or plasma samples. Anticoagulant
evaluations were conducted to determine sample recovery by the assay, as
well as stability at 2 to 8°C and -20°C. Blood from eight donors was collected
into each tube type listed below:
• Plastic K2 EDTA tube
• Glass plasma K3 EDTA tube
• Plastic Sodium Heparin tube
• Plastic Lithium Heparin Tube, Plasma separator gel
• Glass serum tube, no additives (Control Tube)
• Plastic serum tube, no additive
• Plastic serum separator tube
• Plastic Lithium heparin tube
All tubes were processed per the manufacturer’s instructions.. Serum or
plasma from each tube type was then analyzed on a Hitachi 917 analyzer in
triplicate.
Baseline results were obtained on day zero for each type of tube. Percent
recoveries were calculated by the equation below:
(Mean Sample Tube – Mean of Control Tube ) / Mean of Control Tube
(the control tube is plain glass with no additives.)

--- Page 10 ---
The sponsor’s acceptance criterion was a mean recovery of ± 15% for each
tube type as compared to the control tube. The data collected satisfied this
criterion for the anticoagulant tubes tested.
The sponsor also performed a study using aliquots from each anticoagulant
tube in the matrix comparison study above to demonstrate topiramate sample
stability in serum and plasma. The samples were tested for 7 days at 2-8° C,
14 days at -10° C or lower, and 30 days at -10° C or lower. The sponsor’s
acceptance criterion was a recovery of ± 10% of the day 0 concentration.
Based on this the sponsor elected to limit sample stability claims in frozen
samples to 14 days.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
A therapeutic range for topiramate has not been well established. Some reports in
the literature suggest a target range for steady-state concentrations of 2 to 25
µg/mL. Inconsistent correlation exists between levels of circulating topiramate to
toxicity, adverse effects, or clinical efficacy.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
