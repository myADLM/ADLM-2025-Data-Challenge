Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer: Serial number DE54700497 en DE24802382
Agilent DNA microarray scanner: Serial number us22502555
Note: The scanner and bioanalyzer are components of this assay and are cleared only for
this assay and not for any other application. In addition, clearance is only limited to the
bioanalyzer and scanner with the serial numbers as specified above.
I. Device Description:
The MammaPrint® test is performed and provided as a service by Agendia Laboratory. The
test is a microarray based gene expression analysis of RNA extracted from breast tumor
tissue. The test is a custom-designed array chip manufactured by Agilent Technologies using
the Agilent oligonucleotide microarray platform which assesses the mRNA expression of the
70 genes in triplicate. The MammaPrint® microarray features eight 1900-feature subarrays
per glass slide which can each be individually hybridized. Per subarray 232 reporter genes
are printed in triplicate, including the 70 genes which make up the MammaPrint® prognostic
profile. Each subarray additionally includes 915 normalization genes and 289 spots for
hybridization and printing quality control.
The analysis is based on several processes: isolation of RNA from fresh tumor tissue
sections, DNAse treatment of isolated RNA, linear amplification and labeling of DNAse
treated RNA, cRNA purification, hybridization of the cRNA to the MammaPrint®
microaray, scanning the MammaPrint® microarray and data acquisition (feature extraction),
calculation and determination of the risk of recurrence in breast cancer patients.
The MammaPrint® analysis is designed to determine the gene activity of specific genes in a
tissue sample compared to a reference standard. The result is an expression profile, or
fingerprint, of the sample. The correlation of the sample expression profile to a template (the
mean expression profile of 44 tumors with a known good clinical outcome) is calculated and
the molecular profile of the sample is determined (Low Risk, High Risk, Low Risk
Borderline, High Risk Borderline).
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Agendia BV’s MammaPrint®
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
k062694
3. Comparison with predicate:
The device is the same as the predicate, except for the sample collection method. The
previous recommended sample collection method was to freeze the sample immediately
after collection and then ship fresh frozen to Agendia. The current method uses
RNAretain which is a non-toxic tissue storage reagent to stabilize and preserve cellular
RNA and therefore, eliminates the need to freeze the samples immediately after
harvesting. Samples are transported in RNAretain to Agendia BV for MammaPrint
testing. Upon arrival at Agendia, samples are snap-frozen and stored at -70ºC.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None
L. Test Principle:
The MammaPrint® service is a microarray based gene expression analysis of a tumor. Refer

to k062694 for detailed description.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i. Reproducibility of multiple isolations starting from tissue sample collected in
RNAretain:
In order to determine the reproducibility of the MammaPrint® device process
from tissue processing to the end result, five previously analyzed tumor samples
(one borderline, two high risk and two low risk) were isolated in duplicate. Over
multiple days, the ten isolations from five tumors were processed according to
standard MammaPrint® protocols.
Sample Original Result Index from first Index from
index isolation second isolation
S1 0.376 High risk (borderline) 0.254 0.374
S2 0.608 Low risk 0.564 0.553
S3 0.659 Low risk 0.639 0.680
S4 -0.105 High risk 0.068 0.067
S5 -0.305 High risk -0.171 -0.337
No statistically significant difference in MammaPrint® risk group assignment or
MammaPrint® index between the two separate RNA isolations was observed.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Same as previous submission.
Stability of MammaPrint outcomes in RNAretain
To determine if shipment in RNAretain affects stability of MammaPrint outcomes, an
experiment was performed to determine MammaPrint variance in a tumor of which
RNAretain and frozen tissue was available.
A tumor was selected from which both immediately snap-frozen and RNAretain
preserved sections were available. Both sections of the tumor had a similar tumor
cell percentage and similar RNA quality. Both samples were labeled 5 times and
hybridized on MammaPrint microarrays according to standard protocols.
MammaPrint Indices were compared to determine if samples shipped in RNAretain
have a greater stability than tumor sections which are immediately stored at -70°C
after excision.
Results showed that the incorporation of both Cy5 and Cy3 were well above the
Agendia quality control minimum threshold of 3.0. Incorporation was observed to be
significantly higher for samples shipped in RNAretain. (Unpaired T-tests, p=0.018
and p=0.001 respectively). The variance in MammaPrint indices was smaller for
samples that were stored in RNAretain compared to the samples that were frozen
immediately (Stdev 0.022 vs. 0.042). An unpaired T-test of the MammaPrint index

S1	0.376	High risk (borderline)	0.254	0.374

revealed no significant difference in the actual MammaPrint indices for the
RNAretain and frozen samples (p=0.24). Based on these experiments, the stability in
MammaPrint index is greater in samples stored in RNAretain then in samples that
were immediately frozen. The difference in MammaPrint index between RNAretain
and frozen tissue (∆ 0.027) was within the previously determined acceptable limit of
index variation.
d. Detection limit:
Same as previous submission.
e. Analytical specificity:
Same as previous submission.
f. Assay cut-off:
Using Feature Extraction 8.5 and XPrint v1.40 software, the classification threshold is
set at 0.415 (See 2c).
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The samples for this study were collected in 2003 as a pilot study for the Dutch
Raster clinical trial sponsored by the Dutch Health Insurance Council where tissue
would be shipped in RNAretain from 20 hospitals. One set consisted of 33 breast
tumor samples of which one part of the sample was immediately snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -70ºC, another part was stored in RNAretain for 3 to 5 days at
room temperature and subsequently removed from the preservation solution, snap
frozen and stored at -70ºC. Another set comprised of 18 tumors of which two parts
were available for research that were immediately snap frozen and stored at -70ºC.
RNA isolation and DNAse treatment were performed in this same period. HE stained
section were re-examined by a pathologist to confirm invasive ductal carcinoma and
sufficient tumor cell content. All samples were hybridized on MammaPrint
microarrays, and passed all sample, labeling and hybridization QCs. Analysis was
performed using Feature Extraction version 8.5 and XPrint version 1.40.
Results of MammaPrint indices of paired RNAretain and frozen samples are shown in
Figure 1A. The median difference between the RNAretain preserved and the snap-
frozen is 0.070. The Pearson correlation (0.94) and regression analysis indicate a
high similarity (R2 = 0.90).

tumor. A RNAretain-frozen; B frozen-frozen.
This finding is similar to the results of a series of tumors of which two frozen samples
were available and were collected in the same time period (Figure 1B). The median
difference in MammaPrint Index was 0.105. A comparison of the differences in both
series (RNAretain-frozen vs. frozen-frozen) showed no significant difference (t-test,
p=0.57) indicating no variation is introduced by RNAretain.

samples
b. Matrix comparison:
As described above.
c. Comparison of XPrint software v1.40 and v1.33
Due to the update of the Feature Extraction (FE) software from version 7.5 to 8.5, the
MammaPrint analysis software XPrint was updated from v1.33 to v1.40. To validate
5

--- Page 6 ---
this new combination of FE v.8.5/XPrint v1.40 software, 504 samples from the
intended use population were analyzed with both versions of the FE and XPrint
software. Regression analysis showed that the samples analyzed with FE v8.5 had on
average a slightly higher correlation to the XPrint v1.40 than previously observed
with FE v7.5 and XPrint v1.33. The regression equation is shown below:
XPrint v1.40 Index = 1.0675 (XPrint v.1.33 Index) – 0.0116.
The classification threshold for the FE v8.5/XPrint v1.40 combination was set at
0.415 instead of 0.40 after recalibration of the MammaPrint index using the 78
samples from the 2002 Nature study. The new classification threshold was then
validated using 307 samples from the TransBig study and results were analyzed in
relation to time to distant metastasis (see 4x4 and 2x2 tables below).
