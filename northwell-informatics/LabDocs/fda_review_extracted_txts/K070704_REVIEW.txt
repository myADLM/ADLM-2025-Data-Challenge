--- Page 2 ---
2. Indication(s) for use:
TRILOGY is a fully automated, discrete, software-driven, multi-purpose analyzer
for spectrophotometric and potentiometric in vitro determination of analytes in
body fluids. It is an open system intended for clinical use in a professional setting
for use with various chemistry assays that may be adaptable to the analyzer
depending on the reagent used to induce a photometric reaction.
TRILOGY is intended for the quantitative determination of glucose, creatinine
and urea nitrogen in serum. Glucose measurements are used in the diagnosis and
treatment of carbohydrate metabolism disorders including diabetes mellitus,
neonatal hypoglycemia and idiopathic hypoglycemia, and of pancreatic islet cell
carcinoma. Creatinine measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
renal diseases, and in monitoring renal dialysis. Urea nitrogen measurements are
used in the diagnosis and treatment of certain renal and metabolic diseases.
TRILOGY includes an optional Ion Selective Electrodes (ISE) module for the
measurement of sodium, potassium, and chloride in serum and urine. These
measurements are used to monitor electrolyte balance and in the diagnosis and
treatment of diseases involving electrolyte imbalance.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
TRILOGY Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The TRILOGY Analyzer is composed of a carousel system for reagent bottles/tubes
and sample tubes, a carousel compartment with refrigeration unit, barcode reader, a
liquid distribution module, microplate platform, wash station and an optical module.
Reagent bottles/tubes and sample tubes are loaded onto a specific reagent or sample
carousel and are placed into the refrigeration unit of the TRILOGY Analyzer.
Located within the refrigeration unit is a barcode scanner, which scans barcode-
labeled reagents and specimens for identification. Reagents and specimens are
acquired from the carousels via the liquid distribution module. The liquid distribution
module is composed of two probes, the Sample (Small) probe and the Reagent
(Large) probe. The Sample (Small) probe is used to aspirate and dispense volumes
between 1 and 75 μL. It is primarily used for samples but can also be used for
delivering small volumes of reagent. The Reagent (Large) probe is used to aspirate
and dispense volumes between 40 and 250 μL and is primarily used for reagents.
Reagents and samples are pipetted by the Reagent or Sample probes into the 96-well
microplate located on the analyzer deck. In between each aspiration, both probes are
rinsed internally and externally at the washing station to insure proper
decontamination. Once the reagents and samples have been added to the 96-well
plate, the optical module scans the plate and conducts light through each reaction
well. The light received from each reaction well is measured by the
spectrophotometer and the data sent to the computer for analysis.

--- Page 3 ---
Serum or urine samples are pipetted from the sample carousel into the ISE module
through the ion selective electrode injection well. The specimen is then introduced
into the ISE module and pumped through each ion selective electrode. When the
sample passes each individual electrode, the electrical potential of the individual
electrode is measured and the data are sent to the computer for analysis.
See k011900, k003247, k011596, and k000926 for descriptive details for the
reagents.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed following the CLSI standard, EP7-A:
Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline. The
procedure used to evaluate interference was to assay a series of samples with
known concentrations of interferent. Percent recoveries were calculated for
each sample with interferent versus the matched sample without interferent.
Interference was defined as the level at which less than a 10% difference was
observed between a sample with and without interferent. Interferent
concentrations above those stated in Table 3 would contribute to invalid
patient results.
