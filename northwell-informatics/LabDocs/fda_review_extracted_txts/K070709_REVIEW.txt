concentration were tested for the hemoglobin interference. The acceptance criterion is
recovery ± 10% of the initial value. The sponsor claimed that the assay is affected by
a reduction of 3 to 5 pg/mL with hemolysis ≥ 0.10 g/dL for PTH <50 pg/mL and assay
is affected by less than 10 percent with hemolysis ≥ 0.15g/dL for PTH ≥ 50 pg/mL.

Study#1:
The study evaluated the Elecsys PTH assay for its intraoperative applicability in 109
patients with either a diagnosis of Primary Hyperparathyroidism (n=33), or
Secondary Hyperparathyroidism due to renal disease (n=76). Of the latter cohort, 52
patients were on dialysis and 24 had a renal transplant. This study was conducted
using the currently marketed Elecsys PTH STAT assay on the Elecsys 1010
instrurment.
Blood samples were drawn after administration of anesthesia for baseline
measurements and at 10 minutes and 20 minutes post resection of the parathyroid
glands. The study used the generally accepted guidelines that a >50% decrease in
PTH value from baseline suggests complete tumor removal. Of the 109 patients in the
study group, 107 showed sufficient decrease by the second draw with an average
decay of PTH of 79.2% of basal level within 10 minutes for the primary
hyperparathyroid group, and 83.8% of basal level by 20 minutes. Among the renal
patients the decay averaged 85.8%% of basal level by 10 minutes and 87.2% by 20
minutes. Among the renal transplant patients the average decay from baseline was
87.6% in 10 minutes and 89.8% from baseline in 20 minutes.
Two patients did not show the sufficient 50% drop by the second draw at 20 minutes
and therefore were classified correctly as unsuccessful surgeries. However, in both
cases a second surgery was required and both surgeries were successful based on the
required decay of 50% of the PTH value.
The assay met the generally accepted criterion of a >50% decrease from baseline
(before incision) with complete tumor removal for 107 out of 109 patients initially
and 2 out of 2 patients in follow-up surgeries.
Study #2:
The study was conducted using the currently marketed Elecsys PTH assay on the
Elecsys 2010 instrument. In total, 34 patients underwent parathyroidectomy surgery
for renal hyperparathyroidism, 31 of which underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy
and 3 total parathyroidectomy. The study was divided into two parts. The first part
7

--- Page 8 ---
used the first 12 patients to compare the Elecsys PTH assay with the DPC Immulite
assay and the Nichols Quick PTH assay. The second part of the study tested the
ability of the Elecsys PTH assay to be used intraoperatively using the criterion of a
decrease of 50% from baseline as the guideline for designation of a successful
surgery, and combined the remaining 22 patients tested with only the Elecsys PTH
assay giving a total of 34 patients evaluated.
The results of the comparisons are as follows: The Elecsys PTH assay was compared
to the DPC Immulite assay and showed a correlation coefficient of 0.997 with no
significant differences. The Elecsys PTH assay was then compared to the Nichols
Quick assay using the same samples and showed a correlation coefficient of 0.987
with no significant differences.
For the 34 patients evaluated for successful parathyroidectomies based on PTH
values, 33 patients showed >50% decrease from baseline levels at 5 minutes. The
average level of decrease was 74% of the baseline level at 5 minutes post resection.
At 15 minutes post resection, all patients showed >50% with an average level
decrease of 82% of baseline level.
The assay met the generally accepted criterion of a >50% decrease from baseline
(before incision) with complete tumor removal in 34 out of 34 patients in this study.
Study #3:
In this study, the investigators used two successive criteria of PTH decrease at the 15
minute time point. The first criterion was a PTH level at 15 minutes 150 pg/mL or
less. If this was not achieved, the second criterion of a relative PTH decrease of 30%
or less was used.
153 patients underwent parathyroid surgery for renal hyperparathyroidism and had
blood drawn both pre- (before preparation of the parathyroid glands) and post (15
minutes after completion of the parathyroid resection) resections of the parathyroid
glands to determine the applicability of the Elecsys PTH assay to predict a successful
resection. 123 patients underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy and 13 patients
underwent total parathyroidectomy during initial surgeries. Of the 153 patients, 24
had normal kidney function after transplant and 129 suffered from terminal renal
failure. The samples were assayed on the Elecsys 2010 instrument and the per cent
decrease was calculated from the baseline measurements.
The mean PTH decay from baseline for all patients was 81% at 15 minutes (862
pg/ml to 167 pg/mL). All 24 patients with compensated renal failure had PTH levels
decrease >50% predicting successful operations. Of the 129 patients with terminal
renal failure, the Elecsys PTH test showed 114 patients met both criteria. Of these,
108 had a true decline in PTH with no postoperative hyperparathyroidism, and 6 had
a false decline in PTH with no persistent hyperparathyroidism. On the other hand, 15
patients did not meet both criteria and in whom only 3 parathyroid glands were found
during surgery. Of these, 13 were classified as true failure to decline and 2 were
classified as false failure to decline.
The assay met the generally accepted criterion of a >50% decrease from baseline with
complete tumor removal.
