L. Test Principle:
Creatinine is converted to creatine by the action of creatininase. The creatine formed
is hydrolyzed by creatinase to produce sarcosine, which is decomposed by sarcosine
oxidase to form hydrogen peroxide. In the presence of peroxidase, the hydrogen
peroxide formed yields a blue pigment by condensation with N-(3-sulfopropyl)-3-
methoxy-5-methylaniline (HMMPS) and 4-aminoantipyrine. The creatinine
concentration is obtained by measuring the absorbance of the blue color at 596/694
nm. The absorbance of the color is proportional to the creatinine concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated for both serum and urine following recommendations
in CLSI EP-5A2. Studies were conducted at one site over 10-day period with
each sample tested 2 times per run and 2 runs per day. Two levels of serum
pools, 2 levels of serum-based controls, and 3 levels of urine control were
tested. Precision was evaluated for 3 ADVIA instruments for which the results
are given below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor reported linearity and reportable range data for ADVIA 1200,
ADVIA 1650, ADVIA 1800 and ADVIA 2400 instruments. Two urine and
serum sample pools (high and low) were used to prepare 9 equally spaced
concentration levels for an approximate range of 3.5 – 30.0 mg/dL and 30 –
240 mg/dL, respectively. Each test level was run in duplicate on the above
analyzers. Based on a linear regression analysis conducted for measured and
assigned values, Enzymatic Creatinine_2 assay is linear within the entire
range tested across the entire group of instruments evaluated. The sponsor’s
acceptance criterion is <5% difference between expected and observed values.
The sponsor established the assay reportable range for urine at 1 – 245 mg/dL.
Since the above study for serum did not include the values for expected levels
of creatinine, (0.6-1.1 mg/dL), the study below was conducted to evaluate the
assay reportable range for serum.
To evaluate the linearity of the assay within the expected levels of creatinine
in serum (0.6-1.1 mg/dL), the sponsor used the College of American

Pathologists (CAP) Creatinine Linearity/Accuracy Panel (LN24-A) designed
to evaluate the accuracy, calibration, and linearity of a creatinine assays in the
normal and elevated range. The data demonstrated that Enzymatic
Creatinine_2 method on ADVIA 1200, ADVIA 1650, ADVIA 1800, and
ADVIA 2400 instruments correlate with this panel and demonstrate the
linearity of this method in the expected ranges. The data are presented in the
table below. Based on the above studies, the limit of detection, and the method
comparison study, the sponsor established the assay reportable range for
serum and urine at 0.1 – 30 mg/dL and 1 – 245 mg/dL, respectively.

The sponsor also conducted extended linear range studies to establish system
parameters that would trigger a re-run (reanalysis) of high serum or urine
samples so that the labs can re-test samples without having to perform a
manual dilution. The serum and urine samples were tested on all above
mentioned ADVIA systems. Based on the sponsors’ internal acceptance
criteria of ± 10% recovery (neat vs. diluted after reanalysis), the sponsor
established the following upper limits of the extended ranges:
ADVIA 1650/1800/2400 serum/plasma: 5 x 30.0 mg/dL = 150 mg/dL
ADVIA 1650/1800/2400 urine: 5 x 245 mg/dL = 1225 mg/dL
ADVIA 1200 serum/plasma: 3 x 30.0 mg/dL = 90 mg/dL
ADVIA 1200 urine: 4 x 245 mg/dL = 980 mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrator. The sponsor uses single point calibration with previously cleared
(k030169) Bayer Chemistry Calibrator supplied separately for both
serum/plasma and urine. The assigned value of the calibrator is traceable to
Isotope Dilution LC Mass Spectrometry reference method, which uses NIST
reference material (SRM 967).
Controls. To ensure adequate quality control, the sponsor provides and
recommends assaying two quality controls, along with the samples. The
control materials have been previously cleared (k883209) and are supplied
separately.

d. Detection limit:
The sponsor evaluated Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Blank (LoB) on
all ADVIA instruments listed above following the guidelines in CLSI EP17-A.
Based on the evaluation of 59 blank (saline) and 58 low-level (control 1 at 1.7
mg/dL) sample values, the LoD was established at 0.1 mg/dL following the
algorithm, LoD = mean of blank + (1.6455 X SD of blank) + (1.645 X SD of
Low sample).
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor evaluated the effect of hemoglobin (0-1000 mg/dL),
unconjugated bilirubin (0 – 30 mg/dL), conjugated bilirubin (0-30 mg/dL),
and lipemia (intralipid) (0-1000 mg/dL) on normal serum control samples (1
mg/dL and 3 mg/dL) spiked with the interferents, and then compared with
unspiked control. Based on the sponsor-defined interference limit of ± 10%
of control, the following interference limit claims were set by the sponsor for
ADVIA 1200, ADVIA 1650/1800, and ADVIA 2400 instruments tested.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance of the ADVIA Chemistry Enzymatic Creatinine_2 assay was
compared with the predicate device, ADVIA Chemistry Systems Creatinine_2
(CREA_2) (k973993). The ADVIA instrument systems 1200, 1650, and 2400
were used for the comparison. A summary of the sample number, composition,
and the results of linear regression analysis is given below for serum and urine.
The sponsor found correlation between the predicates and the new device for
both serum and urine samples on ADVIA systems as follows:
Specimen Predicate/Instrument n Regression R Sample range
Type Equation (mg/dL)
Serum CREA_2/ADVIA1200 60 y = 1.017x+0.03 1.00 0.3 – 12.3
Serum CREA_2/ADVIA1650 60 y = 1.018x-0.04 1.00 0.3 – 11.9
Serum CREA_2/ADVIA2400 60 y = 1.026x-0.03 1.00 0.3 – 12.1
Urine CREA_2/ADVIA1200 46 y = 1.042x+0.41 1.00 20.0 – 238.1
Urine CREA_2/ADVIA1650 49 y = 1.019x-0.99 1.00 17.8 – 239.4
Urine CREA_2/ADVIA2400 44 y = 1.025x-2.47 0.99 18.9 – 218.1
In another method comparison study, serum samples were tested on all three
instruments. The following results were obtained:
Specimen Predicate/Instrument n Regression R Sample range
Type Equation (mg/dL)
Serum CREA_2/ADVIA1200 28 y = 1.047x+0.01 1.00 0.5 – 25.6
Serum CREA_2/ADVIA1650 42 y = 1.059x-0.15 1.00 0.6 – 25.7
Serum CREA_2/ADVIA2400 42 y = 1.054x-0.14 1.00 0.6 – 25.4
The sponsor also conducted a reference method correlation study using
Isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS), as recommended by the National
Kidney Disease Education Program (NKDEP). Twenty five serum samples
ranging in concentration from 0.5 – 4.5 mg/dL were assayed in three
replicates within a day and found to produce the correlation equation (y =
0.981x -0.01; r = 0.999) between the device and the IDMS
method.

To demonstrate comparable performance between serum and lithium-heparin
or potassium-EDTA plasma, the sponsor compared 42 samples on ADVIA
instrument systems 1200, 1650, 1800 and 2400. Some samples were spiked
with creatinine to extend the sample test range. Compared with the sera for the
sample values ranged (0.4 ~ 26 mg/dL), the mean recovery for the lithium-
heparin or potassium-EDTA plasma produced the following resuls:

Not Applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected values of creatinine were based on literature*. The sponsor states
that they provide these ranges for reference only and each laboratory should
establish its own normal range.
