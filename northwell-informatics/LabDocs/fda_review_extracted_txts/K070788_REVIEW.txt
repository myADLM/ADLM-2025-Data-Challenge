I. Device Description:
The Elecsys Cortisol Assay is a two step sandwich immunoassay with streptavidin
microparticles and electrochemiluminescence detection. Results are determined
using a calibration curve that is generated specifically on each instrument by a 2-point
calibration and a master curve provided with the reagent bar code. The Elecsys
Cortisol Assay is intended for use on the Elecsys Immunoassay Family of Analyzers.
The Salivette device is required for the collection of saliva for testing. The Elecsys
Cortisol CalSet is the calibration material for the assay.

L. Test Principle:
The Elecsys Cortisol Assay is a two step sandwich immunoassay with streptavidin
microparticles and electrochemiluminescence detection. Results are determined
using a calibration curve that is generated specifically on each instrument by a 2-point
calibration and a master curve provided with the reagent bar code. The Elecsys

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Between-run precision of the Elecsys Cortisol Test System was evaluated on
Elecsys 2010 / cobas e 411 analyzer using a modified CLSI replication
experiment. The protocol consisted of testing one replicate of each control
(PC=PreciControl) or sample (HS=human saliva, SHS=spiked human saliva)
per day for 10 days. Between-run precision was calculated according to EP5-
A2.

*sample concentration is above the Limit of Blank, but below the Limit of
Detection of this assay. (see Detection Limit section below). Values below 8.5
nmol/L are not reliable as the coefficient of variation is >20%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The measuring range is 1.00-1750 nmol/L or 0.036-63.0 µg/dL (defined by
the limit of detection and the maximum of the master curve). Performance of
the device across the measuring range was established in k000270, k021218,
and k043175. Performance information at the low end of the assay range is
summarized in the Detection Limit section below.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Established in k000270, k021218, and k043175.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank and limit of detection were determined in accordance with
the CLSI EP17-A requirements.
The limit of blank (≤ 0.50 nmol/L or ≤ 0.018 µg/dL) is the 95th percentile
value from n ≥ 60 measurements of an analyte-free sample over several
independent series. The limit of blank corresponds to the concentration below
which analyte-free samples are found with a probability of 95%.
The limit of detection (≤ 1.00 nmol/L or ≤ 0.036 µg/dL) is determined based
on the limit of blank and the standard deviation of low concentration samples.
The limit of detection corresponds to the lowest analyte concentration which
can be detected (value above the limit of blank with a probability of 95%).
The limit of quantitation (8.50 nmol/L or 0.07 µg/dL) is the lowest analyte
concentration that can be reproducibly measured with a between-run
coefficient of variation of ≤ 20%. It has been determined using low
concentration saliva samples.

Because the %CV of low concentration samples is high, values below the
LoQ should be reported with caution. The package insert has been revised to
read: “When reporting values below 8.5 nmol/L, the client report should
be annotated with the following information. “Values below 8.5 nmol/L
are not reliable as the coefficient of variation is ≥20%.”
