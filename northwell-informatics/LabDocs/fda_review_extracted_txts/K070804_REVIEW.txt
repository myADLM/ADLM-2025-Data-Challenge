4. Special instrument requirements:
The Verigene® System
I. Device Description:
Verigene System: an in vitro diagnostic device for processing and genotyping
multiple genes in a DNA sample. The Verigene System consists of two instruments,
the Verigene Processor and the Verigene Reader, and utilizes single-use, disposable
Test Cartridges to process and genotype multiple genes in a DNA sample in
approximately 1½ hours. Up to eight Verigene Processors may be connected to a
single Verigene Reader. There are four hybridization modules in each Verigene
Processor, and the modules within a Verigene Processor can simultaneously run
different tests.
The Verigene Reader controls the hybridization process in the modules of the
Verigene Processors. It utilizes a graphical user interface to guide the user through
the process of ordering tests and reporting results. Interaction with the touch screen is
minimized through barcode use. This instrument also serves as the reader of the
hybridization substrate using optical detection.
Verigene Processor: When a Test Cartridge is inserted, a barcode reader internal to
the Verigene Processor modules reads the cartridge ID and sends it to the Verigene
Reader. From this information the Verigene Reader will establish the hybridization
parameters and automatically start the hybridization process.
The Test Cartridge consists of two parts: a Reagent Pack which is preloaded with
the reagents necessary for running the desired test in the Verigene Processor, and a
slide where the analysis takes place. All of the steps in the genotyping process take
place within the Test Cartridge.

L. Test Principle:
The Verigene Warfarin Metabolism Nucleic Acid Test genotyping process occurs
with a hybridization of the target analyte to a synthetic gene-specific oligonucleotide
capture strand on the Test Cartridge’s substrate. A synthetic mediator target-specific
oligonucleotide is included with the test-specific sample buffer to form a
hybridization “sandwich” with the gene sequence of interest, followed by washing
steps to remove the unbound DNA from the hybridization chamber. A probe,
composed of a gold nanoparticle with covalently bound oligonucleotides
complementary to a sequence on the intermediate oligonucleotide, is then introduced,
followed by a series of washing steps to remove any unbound probe. A two-part
signal enhancement reagent is added to the chamber and reacts with the gold
nanoparticle to amplify the signal for the Verigene Reader scanning and analysis.
Upon completion of this step, the user removes the Test Cartridge. At this point, the
substrate is inserted in the Verigene Reader. The Verigene Reader illuminates the
signal-enhanced nanoparticles specifically bound to either the wild type of mutant
captures for the gene. A photosensor reads the relative brightness of each spot and
the Verigene Reader outputs a result based on the relative levels of brightness of the
wild type to mutant signals.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three sites participated in the reproducibility study. At each site, five
genomic DNA samples, which covered all possible genotypes for all three
alleles, were each tested in triplicate on a daily basis by the same operator for
three days. Two to three different lots of disposable Test Cartridges were used
at each site.
One site (Site 1) performed the reproducibility testing twice, using two
different operators. Each day, each of the two operators performed the testing
using the same aliquots of solutions on the same instruments.
There were 498 calls made out of 540 possible calls (92.2% call rate),
including 165 out of 180 wild types (wt) (91.7%), 234 out of 252
heterozygotes (92.9%), and 99 out of 108 homozygous mutants (91.7%).
There were no incorrect genotype calls.
Two cartridges, one at Site 1 and one at Site 2 were defective and failed their
run.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability testing protocols, acceptance criteria for stability testing and release
criteria for cartridge lots has been reviewed and found to be acceptable.
Controls: Positive or negative DNA assay controls are not included as part of
the assay. The manufacturer recommends that the user obtain quality control
materials (previously characterized patient samples) to be used with the assay
during installation, system validation, to verify the performance of a new
lot/batch of cartridges, or when the integrity of storage conditions is in
question in addition to following local, state and federal guidelines regarding
quality control testing. See internal controls described below in Section O.:
System Descriptions.
d. Detection limit:
A Limit of Detection (LoD) study was performed to assess the genotyping
performance of the Verigene Warfarin Metabolism panel across a range of
genomic DNA input concentrations. Five genomic DNA input concentrations
were evaluated each across 12 Verigene Warfarin Metabolism Test
Cartridges. Input concentrations were 30 ng/µL, 40 ng/µL, 200 ng/µL, 400
ng/µL, and 500 ng/µL.
Assay performance was evaluated with respect to the following criteria:
genotyping signal intensity, genotyping ratio (genotype number), call rate, and
mis-call rate.
Amt. of DNA No. of Correct Mis- % Correct
(ng/ml) Tests calls calls call rate
30 12 9 0 75
40 12 11 0 92
200 12 12 0 100
400 12 12 0 100
500 11 12 0 92
Across the recommended DNA concentration range of 40 ng/µL – 400 ng/µL,
the call rate ranges from 92 – 100%, with no incorrect genotype calls.
e. Analytical specificity:
An evaluation of potential assay interferences was performed to assess the
genotyping performance of the Verigene Warfarin Metabolism Test
Cartridges, when potential contaminants are present in a purified DNA
sample.
Potential interfering substances that were tested included:
• 1.5 units/mL heparin;
• 3 mg/mL hemoglobin
• 6mM magnesium chloride
• 400 ppm lithium chloride
• 5x concentration magnetic beads
Assay performance was evaluated with respect to the following criteria:

genotyping signal intensity, genotyping ratio (genotype number), call rate, and
mis-call rate.
Samples with heparin, hemoglobin, magnesium chloride, and lithium chloride
augmentation accurately detected 100% of made calls. There was no
significant difference in the signal intensities for 2C9*2 and 2C9*3 wild type
or mutant captures.
The samples with added hemoglobin did have significantly lower signal
intensity at both VKORC1 wild type and mutant captures, however the
genotyping was still accurate. The hemoglobin samples also showed lower
imaging control intensities, higher background and higher virtual exposure
indicating an overall loss of signal.
The samples with added heparin also showed a decrease in the nonspecific
signal at the VKORC1 wild type mismatch capture, but the genotyping result
was still accurate. Additionally, the heparin contaminated samples had lower
negative control signal and background.
Samples augmented with additional magnesium chloride did not differ from
the control. Lithium chloride supplemented samples did have a significantly
higher exposure time which indicates a loss of signal.
The magnetic bead samples in which a 5X bead concentration was compared
to its beadless DNA elution, showed a decrease in specific signal intensity;
however, this did not impact either the call rate (100% for both test group and
control), or genotyping capabilities. Additionally, there was no significant
difference in the intensities of the imaging control, negative control,
background, or exposure time. This data shows that, although high levels of
magnetic beads in the DNA elution does decrease signal, it does not impact
the ability of the system to correctly genotype the patient.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were conducted at three sites, one internal and
two external sites. Testing was performed using multiple lots of Test
Cartridges at each site. Samples were collected and the DNA extracted by a
3rd-party laboratory or by Nanosphere. Whole blood samples were extracted
using common commercial DNA extraction methods. Seventy-five to eighty-
three samples were tested at each site. Testing was performed by laboratory
personnel. There were no incorrect genotyping calls. Three Verigene
cartridges were defective and failed to run due to pre-insertion errors.

N. Instrument Name: Verigene System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The instrument has a single mode of operation with four hybridization modules
that can run 4 different reactions at a time.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ________
The sponsor’s submitted software documentation demonstrated that the software
design meets the stated requirements for this device and were verified and
validated in part by testing the system with known wild type, mutant, and
negative control samples determining that signal detection configurations results
in correct calls/results.
3. Specimen Identification:
Sample identification is performed through entering in the sample ID and the
barcode of the test cartridge to be used with the sample. When the sample is to be
run, the barcode of the test cartridge is scanned.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Whole blood samples collected from a patient undergo an extraction step.
Following the extraction of DNA the sample is then used for analysis by the
device.
5. Calibration: The Verigene System does not require user calibration and the user
does not have the capability to re-calibrate the instrument. The temperature
control system on the Verigene Processor device is the only component that
requires calibration. This is performed at the time of manufacture or by a
Nanosphere service technician. All control parameters are verified by the
system’s 32-bit cyclical redundancy check which is established at the time of
software release. If the protected configuration is modified, the application will
be prevented from running.
6. Quality Control: For single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, it can be
expected that either the mutant or the wild type sequence is present at the loci
tested. Therefore, a system and panel positive control check are built into each
hybridization chamber.
A negative control sequence is included in each well to detect if the effective
hybridization T (melt temperature) of the hybridization chamber is too low. This
m
negative control is intended to detect if the hybridization temperature is incorrect
due to an instrument malfunction or if the hybridization buffer was incorrectly
added due to a user or instrument failure. The Verigene Reader automatically
checks the wild type or mutant target oligonucleotide signal relative to the
negative control oligonucleotide signal. If the target signal is not adequately
higher than the negative control signal, then a “No Call” results.
The threshold limits for the negative control and background checks were
determined empirically with nominal and failure condition testing. The operator is
informed if the “No Call” result is due to the background or the negative control
signal being too high.
A set of oligonucleotide spots on the substrate are called imaging controls. The
imaging controls act as a quality check for proper fluid control and movement
between the Test Cartridge and the instrument. If the imaging controls are absent,
then a “No Call” is output and the user is informed that the reason is due to an
absence of imaging controls.
