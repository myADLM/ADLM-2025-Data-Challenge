H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Minocycline at concentrations of 1 - 32 µg/mL on the Phoenix™ Gram
Positive ID/AST or AST only panel is intended for use with the Phoenix™
system in clinical laboratories as an in vitro diagnostic test to determine the
susceptibility from pure culture of Staphylococcus aureus to antimicrobial
agents when used as instructed in the Phoenix™ system user’s manual.

--- Page 2 ---
Page 2 of 7
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is intended for the
in vitro quantitative determination of antimicrobial susceptibility by minimal
inhibitory concentration (MIC) of most gram-negative aerobic and facultative
anaerobic bacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae and non -
Enterobacteriaceae and most gram-positive bacteria belonging to the genera
Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Enterococcus.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The antibiotic minocycline at concentrations of 1 – 32 µg/mL on the
Phoenix™ GP ID/AST and AST only panels is indicated for testing against
Staphylococcus aureus. Minocycline has been shown to be active against
S. aureus in clinical infections and in vitro against Enterococcus species
(vancomycin resistant).
3. Special condition for use statement(s):
Prescription Use Only
All Gram-positive organisms other than Staphylococcus aureus will be
suppressed from reporting interpretive criteria against minocycline, by the
BDXpert Rules software.
Susceptibility testing should be performed with tetracycline since it predicts
susceptibility testing to minocycline. However, certain organisms (e.g.
S. aureus) may be more susceptible to minocycline and doxycycline than
tetracycline.
The Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommends that results
for chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline (or doxycycline or
minocycline), and rifampin should be reported for enterococcal isolates with
an interpretation of intermediate or resistant to vancomycin (VRE).
Consultation with an infectious disease practitioner is recommended.
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST
Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and
equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™
Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST broth, which contains an AST
indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST broth is a cation-adjusted broth
containing Tween 80. After adding the indicator solution to the AST inoculum, the color

--- Page 3 ---
Page 3 of 7
is blue, and after inoculation and incubation, it changes to pink then colorless as
reduction in the panel well proceeds. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded
into the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System instrument where the panels are
continuously incubated at 35°C. The resulting AST has a final inoculum of 5 x 105
CFU/ml. The system incubates, reads and records the results of the biochemical
substrates and antimicrobial agents and interprets the reactions to give an ID of the isolate
and MIC value and category interpretation of the antimicrobial agents. Organisms
growing in the presence of a given antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator, signaling
organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobic agent. Organisms not growing or
inhibited by a given antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do
not produce a color change. Additional interpretation is done using software driven
“EXPERT” System using rules derived from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI). Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an ID result available
between 2-12 hours and an AST result available between 4-16 hours. This is only an
autoread result; there are no manual readings possible.

(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S17) “Methods
for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;

L. Test Principle:
The AST portion of the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth
based microdilution method that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-
reduction) to enhance detection of organism growth. The MIC is determined by
comparing growth in wells containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the
growth in “growth control wells” which contain no antibiotic.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The broth dilution reference panel was prepared according to the CLSI
recommendation and used to compare with the Phoenix™ results.
Clinical testing was performed at four sites. The testing included 1619
isolates of which 103 were Challenge strains with known results and
1516 were Clinical strains. The 1516 Clinical strains were composed of
710 (46.8%) fresh clinical isolates, 640 (42.2%) recent isolates and 166
(10.9%) stock isolates.
The study included a variety of Gram-positive aerobic Clinical isolates,
and the Challenge isolates consisted of a variety of Enterococcus species
and S. aureus isolates, with the following performance (see table below).
The FDA (CDRH) approved drug labeling provides breakpoints for
minocycline only for Staphylococcus aureus. Therefore, the table below
contains performance data for all Gram positive aerobic species for EA
and Eval EA, and S. aureus only for CA.

Essential agreement (EA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panels agree with the reference
test panel MIC results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference
method. Category agreement (CA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panel result
interpretation (susceptible-intermediate-resistant) agrees exactly with the reference
panel result interpretation. Evaluable (Eval) are results that are within the test range
and on scale.
The overall performance data demonstrates an EA of 98.8% and an Eval EA of
96.5%. There were no vmj or maj generated by Staphylococcus aureus and the CA is
98.5%, which meets the acceptance criteria.
The test device had a growth rate of >95% and the performance data are acceptable.

N. Labeling
The expected value range, interpretive criteria and QC for minocycline utilized in
gram positive panels are included in the package insert. Minocycline is intended only
for Staphylococcus aureus. All Gram-positive organisms other than Staphylococcus
aureus will be suppressed from reporting interpretive criteria against minocycline, by
the BDXpert Rules software.
Susceptibility testing should be performed with tetracycline since it predicts
susceptibility testing to minocycline. However, certain organisms (e.g. S. aureus)
may be more susceptible to minocycline and doxycycline than tetracycline.
The CLSI recommends that results for chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline
(or doxycycline or minocycline), and rifampin should be reported for enterococcal
isolates with an interpretation of intermediate or resistant to vancomycin (VRE).
Consultation with an infectious disease practitioner is recommended.
The MIC only without an Interpretation will print on the final patient chart for
Enterococcus species (VRE only).
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
a substantial equivalence decision.
