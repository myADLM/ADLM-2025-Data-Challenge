L. Test Principle:
The VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin A1c Program is based on the
chromatographic separation of HbA1c on a cation exchange cartridge. The various
forms of hemoglobin exhibit charge differences (positive) at the acidic pH of the
mobile phase, and thus can be separated on a support that is negatively charged
(cation exchange). The use of ion-exchange chromatography then allows molecules to
be separated based upon their charge. Separation is optimized to eliminate
interferences from hemoglobin variants (HbS and HbC), labile A1c, hemoglobin F
and carbamylated hemoglobin.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The first precision study was performed at Bio-Rad on the VARIANT II TURBO
Link Hemoglobin A1c Program using EDTA whole blood patient samples tested
with normal and diabetic hemoglobin A1c content. The method of precision
analysis was performed using a protocol based on CLSI Evaluation Protocol,
Vol.24, No. 25, EP5-A2 (2004) “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical
Chemistry Devices”. In this study, 40 runs (2 per day) were performed on one
VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin Testing System over 20 working days.
In each run, one aliquot of normal HbA1c and diabetic HbA1c patient samples,
controls and four (4) patient samples used as filler to reproduce normal run

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To demonstrate the linearity of the HbA1c measurement on the
VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin A1c Program throughout the
reportable range, low (4.1%) and high (17.6%), EDTA whole blood patient
samples were assessed following CLSI EP6-A guideline “Evaluation of the
Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach”.
The diabetic specimen was mixed with the normal specimen in varying ratios
(i.e.3:1, 1:1 and 1:3) and the measured values were compared to the
theoretical values based upon the dilution factor. Polynomial regression
analysis (for first, second, and third order polynomials) was performed to
determine the statistical significance of the non-linearity. These mixed
samples were analyzed in duplicate on the VARIANT II TURBO Link
Hemoglobin A1c Program using the VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin
Testing System with Sysmex HST-N conveyor. Linear regression analysis
calculated a slope of 1.0039, an intercept of 0.0541, and a correlation
coefficient of 0.9996. The measured results for each dilution were within
±1.0% of the predicted values.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators were previously cleared under k040872.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 4.1 to 17.6% HbA1c (see linearity section above)
e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering substance studies performed included labile A1c, carbamylated
hemoglobin and hemoglobin F. Studies such as bilirubin, lipemia and
hemoglobin S and C were filed with the VARIANT II TURBO Hemoglobin
A1c Program k040872. These studies were not repeated because the reagents
are the same.
Labile A1c concentrations up to 4.7% in non-diabetic patients (4.27-6.0%
HbA1c) and up to 6.4% in diabetic patients do not interfere with the assay.
Hemoglobin F concentrations up to 5% do not interfere with the assay.

Carbamylated hemoglobin concentrations up to 3.1% in non-diabetic patients
(4.27- 6.07% HbA1c) and up to 5.5% in diabetic patients do not interfere with
the assay.
To test the level of interference of carbamylated hemoglobin on the
VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin A1c Program, patient EDTA whole
blood specimen pools with normal and diabetic levels of A1c were split into
two aliquots. The Red Blood Cells (RBCs) of both aliquots were washed with
phosphate buffered saline (PBS). One aliquot of each level was incubated with
a 0.05 M potassium cyanate solution until the carbamylated hemoglobin level
increased by approximately 1, 2, and 3%. Aliquots from each level were
analyzed in duplicate on the VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin A1c
Program on one VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin Testing System
with Sysmex HST-N converyor. The specification for interference states that
the difference between a normal control (without spiked CHb) and a normal
test sample (with spiked CHb) with up to 1.5 % CHb is not greater than +
0.3% HbA1c and the difference between a diabetic control (without spiked
CHb) and a diabetic test sample (with spiked CHb) with up to 1.5% CHb is no
greater than + 0.5% HbA1c. Carbamylated hemoglobin concentrations up to
3.1% in non-diabetic patients (4.27 – 6.07% HbA1c) and up to 5.5% in
diabetic patients did not interfere with the assay.
To determine if HbF interferes with HbA1c quantitation on the VARIANT
IITURBO Link Hemoglobin A1c Program, two pooled EDTA whole blood
patient samples representing normal and diabetic HbA1c levels were split into
two aliquots. One aliquot was spiked with approximately 3, 5, 10 and 15%
purified HbF. The samples were run on a VARIANT II TURBO Link
Hemoglobin Testing System with Sysmex HST-N conveyor. The difference in
%A1c value between a normal control (without spiked HbF) and a normal test
sample (with spiked HbF) had to be < 0.3% to be defined as showing no
interference. The difference in %A1c value between the diabetic control
(without spiked HbF) and diabetic test sample (with spiked HbF) had to be <
0.5% to be defined as showing no interference. The results indicated that HbF
levels up to 5% have no significant effect on HbA1c determination.
To study the interference from labile A1c on the VARIANT II TURBO Link
Hemoglobin A1c Program, two EDTA whole blood patients samples
representing normal and diabetic A1c levels were split into aliquots. These
aliquots were supplemented by the addition of an aqueous glucose stock
solution. The samples were incubated for three hours at 37°C to facilitate
formation of labile A1c. The samples were then run on a VARIANT II
TURBO Link Hemoglobin Testing System with Sysmex HST-N conveyor,
and the samples that were closest to 1, 2, and 3% labile A1c were selected.
The specification for no interference is that the difference in HbA1c value
between a control and test sample with up to 3% labile A1c is no greater than
+ 0.3% HbA1c. The results indicate that the difference in HbA1c was 0.2%
8

--- Page 9 ---
between spiked samples and the control for the normal sample. There was no
difference between spiked samples and the control sample for the diabetic
sample. Labile A1c concentrations up to 4.7% in non-diabetic patients (4.27 –
6.07% HbA1c) and up to 6.4% in diabetic patients do not interfere with the
assay.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To demonstrate accuracy across the measuring range of 4.1 to 17.6 % A1c, the
VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin A1c Program was compared to the
predicate VARIANT II TURBO Hemoglobin A1c Program. 22 EDTA whole
blood patient samples and 29 spiked EDTA whole blood samples were run in
singlicate on the VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin A1c Program and
the VARIANT II TURBO Hemoglobin A1c Program. The range of samples
run on the VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin A1c Program was 3.9 to
17.3 %A1c. A linear regression analysis of the results calculated a slope of
0.961, an intercept of 0.303, and a correlation coefficient of 0.999.
A second study performed at a current customer site evaluated the VARIANT
II TURBO Link Hemoglobin A1c Program compared to the VARIANT II
TURBO Hemoglobin A1c Program. A comparison of 180 EDTA whole blood
patient samples with values distributed from 4.2 to 14.0 % HbA1c were run
in singlicate on both systems. A linear regression analysis of these results
calculated a slope of 0.983, an intercept of 0.225, and a correlation coefficient
of 0.998.

N. Instrument Name:
VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin Testing System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin Testing System in combination with
an automated transport system, such as the Sysmex HST-N System, can run a
closed tube in different modes. It can run a STAT sample, batch of samples or
continuous feed of samples
2. Software:
The VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin Testing System incorporates a
dedicated software package, called CDM 4.1, of instrument control, data control,
results analysis, calibration, quality control and service software. Software
documentation has been included in this submission for CDM 4.1
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Samples are identified on the VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin Testing
System by barcodes on each primary sample tube, corresponding to the sample's
accession identification. Non-patient samples (microvials with controls,
calibrators, primer, etc) have specific barcodes that indicate sample type (e.g. Cal
1 for Calibrator 1).
As a rack moves toward the VARIANT II TURBO Link VSS (VARIANT
10

--- Page 11 ---
Sampling Station), the barcode reader attempts to read the tube barcode. If the
barcode is successfully read, and there is an A1c order for the sample, then the
barcode, rack, and rack position are provided to the VARIANT II TURBO Link
VSS. The VARIANT II TURBO Link VSS provides this information to the CDM
4.1 software, which inserts the information into a Worklist of samples and links
the results to this particular identifiier.
If the barcode is missing or cannot be read, the sample can either be skipped
(assume an A1c order is absent) or processed (assume an A1c order is present). If
the sample is processed, then a sequential ERR barcode number is generated,
along with the rack and rack position for the sample. It is then handled by the
VSS and CDM as noted above.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The Instructions for Use for the VARIANT II TURBO Link Hemoglobin A1c
Program instruct the user that there is no sample preparation necessary, except for
abnormal size tubes. The Primary sample tubes (EDTA whole blood) are loaded
into the Sysmex HST-N sample racks and placed on the Sysmex HST-N transport
line. For sample identification, it is necessary to use adapters (provided by Bio-
Rad) when processing microvials for use of prediluted samples. Microvials with
pierceable caps are used to prevent spillage.
5. Calibration:
Calibration is performed at regular intervals. For each VARIANT II TURBO Link
Hemoglobin A1c Program, Bio-Rad provides calibrator sets of known analyte
concentrations. New analytical or guard cartridges require two levels of
calibration before patients or controls can be processed to provide concentrations
of percent hemoglobin A1c.
6. Quality Control:
External Quality Control materials must be purchased separately. In keeping with
good laboratory practice, diabetic and non-diabetic control specimens should be
included in each run. A repeat run is indicated when expected control values are
not obtained.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
