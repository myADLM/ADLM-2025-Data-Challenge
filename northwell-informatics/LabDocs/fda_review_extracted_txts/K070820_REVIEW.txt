K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI Document EP5-A – “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical
Chemistry Devices”
L. Test Principle:
The ARCHITECT Tacrolimus assay is a delayed one-step immunoassay for the
quantitative determination of tacrolimus in human whole blood using CMIA
technology. Prior to the initiation of the automated ARCHITECT sequence, a manual
pretreatment step is performed in which the whole blood sample is extracted with a
precipitation reagent and centrifuged. The supernatant is decanted into a Transplant
Pretreatment Tube, which is placed onto the ARCHITECT i System. Sample, assay
diluent, and anti-tacrolimus coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined to
create a reaction mixture. Tacrolimus present in the sample binds to the anti-
tacrolimus coated microparticles. After a delay, tacrolimus acridinium-labeled
conjugate is added to the reaction mixture. The tacrolimus on the acridinium-labeled
conjugate competes for the available binding sites on the microparticles. Following
incubation, the microparticles are washed and solutions that initiate the
chemiluminesence reaction are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting
chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). An indirect
relationship exists between the amount of tacrolimus in the sample and the RLUs
detected by the ARCHITECT i System optics.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was assessed at three different sites (the manufacturer’s site and two
clinical sites). Studies were modeled after CLSI EP5-A2 “Evaluation of
Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices”. The manual
pretreatment extraction step was performed for each replicate to verify the
effect of pretreatment procedure on precision estimates. Each site tested two
pooled patient samples and one in-house quality control sample. In addition,
the manufacturer’s site tested two additional in-house quality control samples
and Abbott Immunosuppressant-Multi-Constituent Controls (MCC). Each
sample was analyzed in duplicate using two lots tested twice per day for 20
days (n=80).
The results of the manufacturer’s in-house testing for within run and total
precision are shown in the table below; n= 80 for all samples, reagent lot 1
was tested on Instrument 1 while reagent lot 2 was tested on Instrument 2.
Precision at the clinical sites was comparable.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the claimed assay range (2 – 30 ng/mL) was demonstrated by
diluting five whole blood samples that had been spiked to achieve tacrolimus
concentrations in the upper end of the assay range. Architect Tacrolimus
Calibrator A (0 ng/mL) was used as the diluent. Samples were extracted as per
instructions and each sample was tested in quadruplicate and averaged.
Linearity was defined as 90 – 110% recovery compared to the calculated
value. Recovery of individual samples ranged from 94% to 109% of the
expected values; the grand mean recovery was 102%. The linear regression
equation that represented all samples tested was y = 0.98x + 0.36 with a
correlation coefficient of 0.99.
Recovery of tacrolimus was assessed by spiking aliquots of ten (10) normal
human EDTA whole blood samples with four concentrations of tacrolimus,
pre-treating the sample according to manufacturer’s directions, and testing in
duplicate. The percent recovery was calculated as follows by using the mean
of the two samples: % Recovery = (Mean observed concentration)/ (Mean
Endogenous concentration + Added Concentration) * 100. A summary of the
results is shown in the following table:

A high sample dilution study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of
results when a high sample is diluted with Architect Tacrolimus Calibrator A.
Five patient negative samples with tacrolimus concentrations ranging from 0
to 6 ng/mL were spiked with an additional 45 ng/mL tacrolimus solution then
diluted 1:2 and 1:4, extracted and assayed in quadruplicate. The percent
recovery for the samples diluted 1:2 ranged from 91 to 99%. The percent
recoveries for the samples diluted 1:4 ranged from 91 to 99%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Accelerated stability data currently supports a shelf life claim of 8 months for
the ARCHITECT Tacrolimus Calibrators; real time testing is underway.
The ARCHITECT Tacrolimus Calibrators are traceable to an internal
reference standard gravimetrically prepared and confirmed via HPLC.
Calibrators’ values must be within ±1 % of the reference calibrator value.
The sponsor presented a study that supports the claim that specimens collected
in EDTA may be stored at 2 – 8 °C for up to 7 days before testing.
The sponsor conducted a freeze-thaw study using twelve whole blood samples
spiked with different levels of tacrolimus. Aliquots of the spiked samples were
frozen and thawed one to ten times then assayed and compared to an unfrozen
aliquot. Individual sample recovery was between 86 – 107% while average
recoveries for each freeze-thaw cycle ranged between 96 – 104%.
d. Detection limit:
An analytical sensitivity study was conducted by assaying the 0 ng/mL
tacrolimus calibrator in replicates of 10 on three different instruments over
four separate runs. The sponsor defined analytical sensitivity as the mean of
the 0 ng/mL calibrator plus 2 SD - the lowest concentration of tacrolimus that
can be distinguished from zero with a 95% confidence. The mean was 0.2
ng/mL and the SD was 0.05. Thus, the limit of blank was calculated as 0.3
ng/mL. The sensitivity results support the sponsors’ lower limit of the range
claim of 2 ng/mL.
A functional sensitivity study was conducted to determine the lowest
concentration of tacrolimus at which the sample coefficient of variation (CV)

is 20% for the ARCHITECT Tacrolimus assay. Human whole blood was
spiked with tacrolimus to obtain concentrations at the following
concentrations: 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5 ng/mL. Ten replicates of each
sample were run twice a day for five days. The mean tacrolimus
concentration and total % CV was calculated for each concentration.
Regression analysis of the resulting values showed that the analyte
concentration corresponding to a 20% CV is 0.8 ng/mL, below the sponsors’
lower limit of the range of 2 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Potential interferences were evaluated by comparing the concentration of
samples with known amounts of endogenous substances and tacrolimus to
samples containing only tacrolimus. All interferents were tested at two or
more concentrations of tacrolimus. All samples were pretreated and assayed in
duplicate and the mean was calculated. Results, expressed as percent recovery
compared to the control, are summarized in the chart below:
Endogenous Interferent Study: Fujirebio Architect Tacrolimus Assay

Hematocrit 55 % 106 %
Rheumatoid Factor 245 IU 99 %
Triglycerides 800 mg/dL 96 %
Uric Acid 20 mg/dL 98 %
Potential cross-reactivity of the assay with some tacrolimus metabolites was
evaluated by adding 10 ng/mL of each metabolite to whole blood samples
spiked with one of five different levels of tacrolimus across the assay range.
Duplicates of each metabolite/tacrolimus concentration were assayed; the
difference between the tacrolimus only sample and the tacrolimus and
metabolite sample was used to calculate cross-reactivity.
Total cross-reactivity was calculated as the mean of each of the differences
divided by the total concentration of the metabolite added. The results are
shown in the chart below:

immunosuppressive and nephrotoxic effects of tacrolimus, co-administration of
other immunosuppressants, type of transplant, time post-transplant and a number
of other factors contribute to different requirements for optimal blood levels of
tacrolimus. Therefore, individual tacrolimus values cannot be used as the sole
indicator for making changes in treatment regimen and each patient should be
thoroughly evaluated clinically before changes in treatment regimens are made.
Each user must establish his or her own ranges based on clinical experience.
Therapeutic ranges vary according to the commercial test used, and therefore
should be established for each commercial test. Values obtained with different
assay methods cannot be used interchangeably due to differences in assay
methods and cross-reactivity with metabolites, nor should correction factors be
applied. Therefore, consistent use of one assay for individual patients is
recommended. When elimination of tacrolimus is impaired (e.g. during
cholestasis), tacrolimus metabolites may accumulate. The immunoassay may
overestimate the concentration of tacrolimus. In such cases, the use of a specific
assay (e.g. Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry
[LC/MS/MS]) could be considered.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
