L. Test Principle
Creatinine is determined by enzymatic colorimetric assay. Creatinine is converted to
sarcosine with the aid of creatininase and creatinase. Sarcosine is then converted to glycine,
formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of oxygen by sarcosine oxidase. The
liberated hydrogen peroxide reacts with 4-aminophenazone and HTIB to form a quinone
imine chromogen in a reaction catalyzed by peroxidase. The color intensity is directly
proportional to the concentration of creatinine present and can be measured photometrically
at 540nm.

b. Linearity/ Assay reportable range.
Serum/plasma
The linearity study was performed using CLSI EP6-A as a guideline. Linearity was
tested on serum samples medium and high for examination of various ranges of
creatinine concentration. The samples were diluted in 11 steps (from 0% to 100%)
with saline as diluent. Four replicate measurements were performed using one reagent
lot. The linearity of CREATININE (Enzymatic) was analyzed on T60 over a
measured range of 0.07 to 0.74 mg/dL with the linearity summary as Slope: 0.985;
intercept: 0.000; Obs. Err: 4.4%; N: 11.
The Linearity of CREATININE (Enzymatic) was analyzed on T60 over a measured
range of 0.798 to 34.945 mg/dL with the linearity summary as Slope: 0.969; intercept:
0.786; Obs. Err: 1.5%; N: 11. The claimed measuring range is 0.11 mg/dL to 28.0
mg/dL.
Urine:
The linearity study was performed using CLSI EP6-A as a guideline. Four parallel
measurements were made in random order using one reagent lot. The samples were
diluted in 11 steps. Urine was spiked with commercially available creatinine solution
to a value of 536 mg/dL. The dilutions were made to urine and further diluted with
saline. The Linearity of CREATININE (Enzymatic) was analyzed on T60 over a
measured range of 2.3 to 452 mg/dL with the linearity summary as Slope: 1.001;
intercept: 0.082; Obs. Err: 2.2%; N: 11. The claimed measuring range is 2.3 mg/dL to
452.0 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators or methods)
The stability claim was verified using an accelerated stability protocol. The assay was
calibrated using a valid calibrator and accelerated calibrator material was measured as
sample in triplicates. The verification of the real time stability is on going. The
acceptance criteria for the calibrator were ± 5% of the target value. The open vial

stability of the sCal, Nortrol and Abtrol were established. The opened vials were stored
tightly capped at 2ºC - 8ºC for nine days. Three vials of calibrator/control material
were measured as samples in triplicates at time points of 4, 7 and 9 days. The
acceptance criteria for the calibrator were ± 5% of the initials value. The acceptance
criteria for the controls were ± 10% of the initial value.
Reagents in unopened vials are stable at 2ºC - 8ºC until the expiry date printed on the
label. Refer to the Application Notes of T60 instrument for the on board stability of
reagents.
Calibration material
The sCal, kit code 981831, when used according to the instructions provided for T60
instrument may remain on the instrument for a maximum of one hour.
Traceability:
The calibrator values were obtained by multi determinations performed by Thermo
Fisher Scientific Oy. The assigned value is the median of all values obtained. The
assigned value of the calibrator is traceable to NIST reference material (SRM 967).
Quality Control materials
The values on control materials are traceable to the reference material, NIST SRM 967.
Users are instructed in the labeling to use quality control samples at least once a day
and after each calibration and every time a new bottle of reagent is used. It is
recommended to use at least two levels (low and high) of controls. Available controls
are Nortrol, kit code: 981043 and Abtrol, kit code: 981044.
d. Detection Limit:
The study was performed using CLSI EP17-A as a guideline. In the limit of blank study
thirty replicates of a blank sample (0.9% NaCl) were assayed using two T60 instruments
and two reagent lots with the total number of measurements being 60.
Limit Of Blank (LOB): The Limit Of Blank (LOB) represents the highest measurement
result that is likely to be observed for a blank sample (0.9% NaCl, n=60). Based upon the
studies conducted for LOB, the following results were obtained:
Serum/plasma: 0.01 mg/dL; Urine: 0.11 mg/dL
In the Limit of Detection study five low level samples were assayed in ten replicates with
two T60 instruments and two reagent lots during two days with the total number of
measurements being 100. Based upon the studies conducted for LOD, the following
results were obtained:
Limit of Detection (LOD): Limit of Detection (LOD) represents the lowest amount of
analyte in a sample that can be detected (n=100).
Serum/plasma: 0.02 mg/dL; Urine: 0.23 mg/dL
e. Analytical Specificity
Serum/plasma:
Unconjugated Bilirubin: No interference found up to 23 mg/dL (400 µmol/L). Higher
bilirubin concentrations cause erroneously low creatinine values.
Conjugated Bilirubin: No interference found up to 17 mg/dL (300 µmol/L). Higher
bilirubin concentrations cause erroneously low creatinine values.
