L. Test Principle:
The Olympus Creatine Kinase-MB assay uses 2 steps to determine the presence of
creatine kinase MB isoenzyme in human serum or plasma. The R1 reagent contains
an antibody which binds the M subunit of CK in the serum sample thereby inhibiting
the activity of the M subunit. The B subunit of the enzyme remains free to act on the
substrate present in the R2 reagent. CK reversibly catalyzes the transfer of a
phosphate group from creatine phosphate to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to give
creatine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as products. The ATP formed is used to
produce glucose-6-phosphate and ADP from glucose. The glucose-6-phosphate is
oxidized to give NADPH and 6-phosphogluconate. The rate of increase of
absorbance at 340/660 nm due to the formation of NADPH is directly proportional to
the activity of CK/MB in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor conducted precision studies according to CLSI EP5-A2
guideline. The sponsor tested 2 runs in duplicate for 20 days (n=80) on low,
medium and high analyte human plasma pools samples. The within-run and
total CVs for each three instrument classes and are shown in the table below.
The results met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of within run CV < 5% or
SD ≤1 U/L and the total precision of < 6.5% or SD ≤ 2 U/L.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor conducted a linearity study based on CLSI EP6-P2. A high pool
sample was serially diluted to cover the sponsor’s claimed linear range of 10
to 2000 U/L. Each dilution was assayed in quadruplicate and the mean
analytical results were plotted versus the relative analyte concentrations (%
dilution). The results met the sponsors’ acceptance recovery criteria of 10-
2000 U/L ≤ 10% or 5 U/L. The results for the diluted samples ranged from
21.91% to 4.48 %. When the percent recovery was greater than 10%, it was
with samples that were less than 5 U/L. The values met the sponsor’s
predetermined acceptance criteria.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor conducted on board stability studies on the Olympus Analyzers
by allowing the reagent to degrade based on constant usage. The linearity was
checked for all three instruments (AU400, AU640 and AU2700) and the
results support the sponsors’ on-board stability claim of 30 days.
The sponsor also conducted a closed stability for the AU2700 via a stress
model. The results shown below support the sponsors’ closed-stability claims
of up to 18 months.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor conducted a limit of quantitation study with the Olympus CK-
MB reagent on the Olympus Clinical Chemistry Analyzers. Three patient
samples or pools were assayed 40 times at an analyte concentration below the
bottom of the measuring range. The level of CK-MB at which a CV is less
than 20% for the 40-fold sample is the lowest CK-MB concentration that the
assay can measure accurately. The limit of detection of the Olympus CK-MB
reagent was determined for the instruments below and supports the sponsor’s
limit of detection claim of 10 U/L.
Mean Conc. (U/L) SD CV %

AU600/640/640e 3.951 0.756 19.1
AU2700/5400 3.930 0.716 18.2
The sponsor conducted a limit of blank study with the Olympus CK-MB
reagent on the Olympus Clinical Chemistry Analyzers. Analyte-free sample
(water) was assayed 20 times on three analyzers. Analytical sensitivity was
measured by calculating the absolute mean plus 3 standard deviations. The
analytical sensitivity of the Olympus CK-MB reagent was determined for the
instruments below and supports the sponsor’s limit of blank claim of 5 U/L.

e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor evaluated common interfering substances on the Olympus
Clinical Chemistry Analyzers according to CLSI Guideline EP7-A. One lot
(with three reagents) was tested on three instruments to determine the
interferences of bilirubin and lipemia. The mean analytical result of the
sample containing the interferent is compared with that for the non-spiked
sample. The results from bilirubin and lipemia are shown in the tables below.
The sponsor has notified users in their package insert to use serum and
heparinized plasma samples free from hemolysis because adenylate kinase
from red blood cells may react with the reagent to produce spurious results
and such specimens should not be used.

MB OSR6X155 (current) with the sponsors predicate device Olympus CK-
MB OSR6X53 on the AU640 instrument using the CLSI Guideline EP9-A.
The slope, intercept and correlation coefficient were calculated by linear
regression. The samples ranged from 12 to 1860 U/L. The resulting equation

Additionally the sponsor conducted comparison studies using the other two
instruments (AU400 and the AU2700) against the reference instrument
AU640. The AU400 equation was y=1.004x – 3.253 with a correlation
