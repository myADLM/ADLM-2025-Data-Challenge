L. Test Principle:
The ETOH method is based on an enzymatic reaction. Reagent 1 contains the
buffering system. Reagent 2 contains alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), the
coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), buffer, preservatives, and
stabilizers. The ADH catalyzes the oxidation of ethyl alcohol to acetaldehyde.
During this reaction, NAD is reduced to NADH. The absorbance due to NADH
(proportional to the ETOH concentration) is determined using a two-filter (340-
383 nm) bichromatic rate technique.
Ethyl alcohol + NAD <--------> acetaldehyde + NADH (absorbs at 340 nm)
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor conducted reproducibility studies according to CLSI Guideline for
Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods
(EP5-A2). Precision studies were conducted by testing two runs per day of three
levels of a commercially available ethanol/ammonia control, serum pool, plasma
pool and a urine pool (all in duplicate) for 20 days with one reagent lot. The mean
values and standard deviations for repeatability and within-lab results are shown
in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated by comparing observed recovery (n=5) of spiked
serum/plasma/urine samples serially diluted from 0 to 345 mg/dL. Urine,
serum, and plasma specimens spiked with ethanol were used and prepared in
ten percent increments. A linear regression analysis was then performed on

the data and plotted for visual confirmation of linearity. Linear regression
comparing observed recovery versus theoretical recovery was used. The
instrument generates a flag which states “Above Assay Range” or "Below
Assay Range". In addition to this, automatic dilutions are performed by the
instrument for results that fall outside the assay range. Automatic dilutions are
defined in the method parameters and cannot be changed by an operator.
The data provided in the table below supports the claimed measuring range of
3 mg/dL to 300 mg/dL.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device does not include calibrators. The sponsor recommends using
calibrators by Dade Behring Inc. CHEM 3 Calibrator, Catalog Number
KC130.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit was defined as the concentration of two standard
deviations of twenty replicates of a zero calibrator run on the Vista 104. The
sponsors’ results support the claimed detection limit of 3 mg/dL. The
instrument will report samples that are less than 3 mg/dL as “less than 3
mg/dL”.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor conducted interference testing according to CLSI EP-7A2.
Substances which potentially could interfere with the Dimension Vista®
ETOH assay were spiked into aliquots of fresh serum and urine pools. Spiked
samples were analyzed and the results were compared to control samples
prepared without the potential interfering substance. Differences of less than
10% were considered non-interfering.

comparison studies. The method comparison studies for 50 urine specimens
were conducted at Dade Behring by R&D personnel. The method comparison
studies for 117 serum specimens were conducted by trained laboratory
personnel at an outside laboratory. All the samples were measured in singlet
and only one specimen per patient was obtained. The correlation study
between the device (ETOH) and the predicate yield for urine and serum
yielded the following results.
