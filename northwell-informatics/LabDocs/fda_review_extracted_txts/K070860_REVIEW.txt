H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The MicroScan® Synergies plus™ Gram Positive MIC/Combo Panel is used to
determine quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies
grown on solid media of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-positive
enterococci and staphylococci. After inoculation, panels are incubated for 4.5 – 18 hours
at 35°C ± 1°C, in a WalkAway® SI, or equivalent, and read by the MicroScan®
Instrumentation. Additionally, the panels may be incubated in a non-CO incubator and
2
the Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST) portions can be read visually, according
to the Package Insert.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The testing of Clindamycin at concentrations of 0.03 – 8 µg/mL (Long Dilution
Sequence) and 0.12 – 2 µg/mL (5-Dilution Breakpoint [BP] Sequence) to the Gram-
Positive MIC/Combo test panel is indicated for testing Staphylococcus aureus
(penicillinase and non-penicillinase producing strains) and Staphylococcus epidermidis
(penicillinase and non-penicillinase producing strains) at 4.5-16 hours or 16-20 hours for
a overnight reading.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
• Turbidity method of inoculum preparation only.
• For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
Each panel contains two control wells: a negative control well, and a growth control well
which contains test medium without antibiotic. Antibiotics are diluted in water, buffer, or
minute concentrations of broth to selected concentrations prior to dehydration of the panels.
The panel is rehydrated and inoculated at the same time with 0.1 ml of suspension prepared
by the turbidity method (inoculum prepared in 0.4% saline with Pluronic® (a wetting agent),
then 0.1ml transferred to 25 ml of inoculum Synergies plus Pos Broth with Pluronic®) for a
Page 2 of 10

--- Page 3 ---
final inoculum concentration of 3-7 X 105 CFU/ml. Panels are incubated in a Walk-Away®
System and read periodically starting at 4.5 hours until sufficient growth to determine the
MIC. Alternately the panels may be incubated at 35o C in a non-CO for 16-24 hours and
2
read by visual observation of growth.

Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
The WalkAway® SI uses a Colorimetric Optics System consisting of a color wheel/lamp
assembly and a Photosensor. There is an initial read at 2.5 hours with a possible final read at
4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 8, 12, 16/18 hours (overnight instrument readings, manual readings), or 24
hours depending on the growth rate of the organism being tested. No reading below 16 hours
of incubation is reported. The time of final read is dependent on the user preference, the
growth rate of the organism, and the sensitivity of the automatic reader since cell densities
below 2 x 107 cells/ml are not detected.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:

days in triplicate. The study included the testing on the WalkAway® SI read at <16
hours, WalkAway® 16-18 hour readings and manual readings at 16-20 hours
incubation. The Reproducibility total for the Rapid read method equaled 330 isolates
The WalkAway® SI had 30 results that were not readable at <16 hours. All results
were >95% reproducible for the Long Dilution and the 5-Dilution Breakpoint
Sequence for all read methods. Performance claims are based on the Rapid read
method.
There was a trend for the Rapid read method to produce slightly more susceptible
results.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC isolates were tested a sufficient number of times with
acceptable results on all testing days with the reference method. Quality control
results demonstrated the ability of the different reading parameters (manual and
instrument) to produce acceptable results >95% of the time. The following tables
provide the frequency of the results in each concentration with the expected range
stated.

This trend was not observed for the five Breakpoint Dilution Sequence QC results.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical testing was conducted at three sites using fresh isolates supplemented with
stock isolates. A total of 304 gram-positive isolates were tested of which 268 were
fresh isolates and 36 were stock isolates. Fourteen (14) Clinical isolates for the Long
Dilution and the Breakpoint Dilution Sequences were reported at ≥16 hours and were
not included as Rapid read results. There were 75 challenge isolates tested at one site
and compared to the reference broth dilution result mode that was determined by
previous testing of each isolate multiple times in the recommended reference panel.
Fourteen (14) Challenge isolates for the Long Dilution and the Breakpoint Dilution
Sequences were reported at ≥16 hours and were not included as Rapid read results.
The Synergies plus™ readings were obtained at times between 4.5 and 16 hours of
incubation for > 95% of the results. An additional comparison was done with
readings on the instrument after overnight incubation and also read manually when
incubated 16 - 18 hours. Performance by these alternate reading methods was also
acceptable with no apparent differences or trends.
The recommended CLSI reference method was followed with the exception of the use
of a small amount (0.1%) Pluronic® in the final inoculum. A validation of the use of
Pluronic® in the frozen reference panels was conducted. Similar calculations for the
different reading methods were performed with very little difference. QC was also
performed. There was a slight trend for the Rapid read method to produce more
susceptible QC results than the reference method results, if only by one dilution. This
trend was also observed in the Reproducibility studies.
The chart below demonstrates the performance of all three reading methods
(Synergies plus™ readings at <16 hours, overnight on the WalkAway® and manually
read at 18 hours using the TouchScan®-SR) when compared to the reference method.

EA-Essential Agreement maj-major discrepancies
CA-Category Agreement vmj-very major discrepancies
R-resistant isolates min- minor discrepancies
NA – Essential Agreement result are not applicable for Breakpoint format
Essential agreement (EA) is when the MicroScan® Synergies plus panel
agrees with the reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling
dilution of the reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the
MicroScan® Synergies plus panel interpretation (S-I-R) agrees exactly
with the reference panel interpretation. Evaluable (Eval) are results that
are within the test range and on scale.
Of the 75 Challenge isolates tested, the expected results for 41 strains were
Susceptible and 34 strains were Resistant. One very major error (1/7, 14.3%)
occurred in the Challenge Set data. The vmj error was generated by one S.
epidermidis (methicillin-resistant) by the Overnight Instrument and the Overnight
Manual read methods in both the Long Dilution and the 5-Dilution Breakpoint
Sequence data, but a vmj error was not detected by the Rapid read method, because
the read time was >16 hours. Although the expected result for this isolate was
resistant, the reference result on the day of testing was susceptible and was in
agreement with the Overnight Instrument and the Overnight Manual read methods
results. The overall combined EA and the CA for the Challenge Set Data was >95%
for all read methods and dilution combinations. There was one (1) major error (6.7%,
1/15) produced by one S. aureus (methicillin-sensitive) generated by the Rapid read
method only. The overall maj error rate of 2.9% (1/34) for the Challenge Set Data for
all read methods was in the acceptable range. Therefore, the Challenge Set
performance data are acceptable.

The Clinical data Rapid read method EA of 98.3% and the CA of 99.3% are both very
good. Overnight Instrument and Manual read methods EA and CA are both very
similar to the Rapid read method results for the Long Dilution and the 5-Dilution
Breakpoint Sequence data results.
There were no vmj errors generated by any of the read methods. There was 1 maj
error (1/213, 0.5%) produced by the Overnight Instrument and the Overnight Manual
read methods. This maj error was not observed in the Rapid read method results
because the time-to-results was >16 hours. Because of the number of off-scale results
in the Clinical data results, no real trending was observed.
The overall error rates are within acceptable limits for all reading methods. The
performance data are acceptable for both the Long Dilution and for the 5-Dilution
Breakpoint Sequence results using the Rapid read (<16 hour) method.
