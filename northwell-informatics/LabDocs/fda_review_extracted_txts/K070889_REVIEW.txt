4. Special instrument requirements:
For use on the 1235 AutoDELFIA automatic immunoassay system.
I. Device Description:
Assay: The anti-IRT-Eu tracer is a stock solution of approximately 50 ug/mL of
mouse monoclonal antibodies. There are three sets of two vials, each containing 2.4
mL. The tracer is in Tris-HCl buffered (pH 7.8) salt solution with bovine serum
albumin, mouse IgG and less than 0.1% sodium azide (preservative). The Neo IRT
Assay buffer is provided in three 120 mL bottles containing Tris-HCl buffered (pH
7.8) salt solution with bovine serum albumin bovine globulin, Tween 40,
polyethyleneglycol 6000, an inert red dye and less than 0.1% sodium azide
(preservative). The Anti-IRT microtitration strips come as three sets of four plates.
These strips contain 8x12 wells coated with antibodies directed against a specific site
on the IRT molecular (mouse monoclonal).
Standards (calibrators) consist of 3 sets of 6 vials (levels) of lyophilized material
(trypsin in Tris-HCl buffered salt solution with bovine serum albumin and protease
inhibitors).
Controls consist of three sets of 3 vials (levels) of lyophilized material
Level CL contains 40ng/mL of blood, level CM contains 95 ng/mL of blood, and
level CH contains 200 ng/mL of blood. (Note that 1ng/mL blood equals 2.22 ng/mL
serum assuming 55% hematocrit). (The lyophilized controls are produced from
trypsin in Tris-HCl buffered salt solution with bovine serum albumin and protease
inhibitors.)

L. Test Principle:
The AutoDELFIA Neonatal IRT L assay is a solid phase, two-site
fluoroimmunometric assay based on the direct sandwich technique in which two
mouse monoclonal antibodies are directed against two separate antigenic
determinants on the IRT molecule. Standards, controls and test specimens containing
IRT are reacted simultaneously with immobilized monoclonal antibodies directed
against a specific antigenic site on the IRT molecule and europium-labeled
monoclonal antibodies (directed against a different antigenic site) in assay buffer.
The assay buffer elutes IRT from the dried blood spots on the filter paper discs. The
complete assay requires only one incubation step.
Enhancement Solution dissociates europium ions from the labeled antibody into
solution where they form highly fluorescent chelates with components of the
Enhancement Solution. The fluorescence in each well is then measured. The
fluorescence of each sample is proportional to the concentration of IRT in the sample.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision: imprecision of the kit was determined using spiked, dried blood
spot samples created by pooling heparinized whole blood samples collected
from three donors and spiking to three analyte levels. Three kit lots were
tested in 18 runs consisting of 4 plates with 4 replicates and with 3
AutoDELFIA instruments.
Results using a full calibration curve on each plate:

1 49.0 8.8 1.6 11.0 11.1
2 74.8 7.5 1.4 9.4 9.5

3 117 8.8 1.2 11.1 11.2
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using CLSI Document EP6-A2 as a guideline.
The measuring range for this device is 13 – 370 ng/mL.
Unprocessed fresh heparin whole blood was used as a “low concentration”
pool. Trypsin dissolved in 10 mM Glycine-HCl, pH 3.0, was added to
heparinized whole blood to obtain a “high concentration” pool. Samples with
intermediate concentrations were prepared by diluting the high concentration
pool with the low concentration pool to various concentrations across the
measuring range before spotting on filter paper. Trypsin concentrations of the
series of samples were measured with the Neonatal IRT L kit during a single
run. The samples were analyzed in 6 replicates.
Linear Regression statistics:
y = 0.98x + 0.31
r2 = 0.998
In addition, observed IRT concentration at each dilution was within ± 10% of
the expected IRT concentration.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Human pancreas trypsin is purchased as a frozen liquid (there is no
international reference preparation or reference method for immunoreactive
trypsin IRT) and used to manufacture a primary calibrator for the IRT L kit

calibration (see below). Secondary calibrators are manufactured and value
assigned based on direct comparison to primary calibrators. Level calibrators
(dried blood spots, stored at -20°C) and kit controls and calibrators
(lyophilized and stored at 4°C) are assigned values based on the secondary
calibrators.
Stability:
In-use and on-board stability: Reconstituted stability of the IRT L standards
and controls is 1 week at 2-8°C. Wash solution for the plate processor is
stable for 2 weeks at 2-25°C in a sealed container. Wash solution for the
sample processor is stable for 1 week at 2-25°C in a sealed container.
On-board stability of all the reagents, except the controls, is 24 hrs. Study
protocols, summary data and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to
be acceptable.
Real-time and accelerated stability: Study protocols, preliminary data and
acceptance criteria for stability testing were provided for the Neonatal IRT L
kit for real-time studies at recommended storage temperatures (2-8°C) and
accelerated temperatures and found to be acceptable. Based on the
accelerated stability data, nine month stability at 2-8°C is claimed for the kit.
Real-time studies will continue to confirm and extend the dating.
Specimen stability: As noted in the package insert, specimens stored in
ambient temperature should be analyzed for IRT within two weeks of
collection as IRT levels decrease 6-9% per week. For longer storage, place
specimens in plastic bags and store frozen1, 2. Seasonal variation in IRT levels
have been reported3. The cause may be due in part to the instability of IRT
during transport and storage.

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of the Blank (LoB) for the AutoDELFIA Neonatal IRT L kit was
determined in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP17-A: Protocols for
Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation. Multiple
(72) measurements of two sample types, the zero calibrator and dried human
blood spots (with low levels of analyte), were performed with the Neonatal
IRT L kit. The Limit of the Blank was determined to be 0.18 ng/ml, the 95th
percentile of the distribution of the test values.
The low limit of the claimed assay measuring range (13 ng/mL) was
determined based on the linearity study described above.

e. Analytical specificity:
The Neonatal IRT L kit was evaluated for interference consistent with CLSI
Guideline EP7-A2.
Heparinized whole blood samples taken from three donors were pooled and
spiked with two medically relevant trypsin concentrations (60 and 100 ng/ml).
Unconjugated bilirubin (up to a concentration of 200 mg/l) and hemoglobin
(5000 mg/l) were added to the pools before creating dried spots on filter paper
and analyzed in six replicates in parallel with unspiked samples. Testing of
these concentrations showed no interference in the measurement of the two
analyte levels. Testing of lipemic (triglycerides ≤ 5000 mg/l) and icteric
(bilirubin ≤ 30 mg/dl) samples was evaluated with a previous device
(k003668) that uses the same assay reagents and found not to interfere with
the measurement of IRT.
As noted in the package insert: if the specimen is not applied directly onto the
filter paper, do not use EDTA or citrate tubes or capillaries to collect blood, as
these anticoagulation reagents will affect the assay by chelating the europium
label.
Hook effect: The potential for hook effect was evaluated with a previous
device (k003668) that uses the same assay reagents and showed no hook
effect for the Neonatal IRT L kit when concentrations up to 40,000 ng/ml IRT
were tested.
Carry over: A study was performed to determine the extent of carry-over in
the sample pipetting probes when the Neonatal IRT L kit is used with the
1235 AutoDELFIA automatic immunoassay system. The aim was to
determine whether IRT-containing samples in liquid form (standards and
controls) transfer between the wells by the pipetting probes. The patient
samples are dried blood spots, therefore there is no possibility of carry-over of
those samples. Carry-over was determined by pipetting first the IRT standard
F (500ng/ml) and thereafter the analyte-free calibrator A. This was repeated
three times with each sample probe. Carry-over percentage was defined as the
average amount of IRT transferred from the high sample to the analyte-free
sample well, as a percentage of the high sample concentration. The study
consisted of four different assays performed with two different instruments,
repeated once for a total of eight assays in the study. The observed carry-over
result observed in all of the tests performed ranged from 0.002% - 0.272%.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The AutoDELFIA Neonatal IRT L kit was compared to the predicate device
6

--- Page 7 ---
using CLSI Document EP9-A2 as a guideline for the method comparison
study.
The AutoDELFIA Neonatal IRT L kit was compared to the predicate device
(AutoDELFIA Neonatal IRT kit) using spiked (heparinized whole blood
samples spiked with trypsin) and routine screening blood spot specimens.
Samples were tested over 5 operating days. 99 specimens with an IRT range
of 13 - 366 ng/mL blood were tested. The correlation was found to be:
y = 0.883x – 0.655
r2 = 0.963
Clinical data was provided to establish clinical performance of the device
(see section 3c. below) since the assay does not analytically align well with
the predicate device.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:

b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Clinical data from 168622 newborn screening specimens tested in a U.S. state
laboratory are presented in the following tables. The numbers reported in this
section are from initial screens only, unless otherwise noted. All initial screens
were performed in singlicate using the AutoDELFIA Neonatal IRT L kit. The
screening strategy was as follows: Samples with the highest 1.6% (> 62
ng/mL) of the IRT results were tested by DNA analysis of the Cystic Fibrosis
Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. Samples having a CF-
related genotype in the DNA analysis were tested using a diagnostic sweat
test. The CF-positive cases detected (see chart below) include 10 sweat test
positive cases and 14 cases with intermediate sweat test result (suspect CF).

4. Clinical cut-off:
Each laboratory should establish its own reference range and cut-off value from a
representative sample population. Some laboratories choose to set the cut-off at
the top 1% to 5%1. Selection of the cut-off percentile depends on the sensitivity
and specificity objectives of the screening program. Choice of a cut-off e.g. 5%
of the daily IRT results increases screening sensitivity, whereas selection of a cut-
off e.g. 1% minimizes the number of samples referred for second tier testing.
Do not use a cut-off that is based on data collected with another product and do
not use a fixed cut-off.
