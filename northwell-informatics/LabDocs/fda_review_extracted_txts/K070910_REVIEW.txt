E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Sysmex UF-1000i, an automated urine particle analyzer, is a dedicated
system for the analysis of microscopic formed elements in urine specimens. The
instrument consists of three principal units; (1) Main unit which aspirates, dilutes,
mixes analyzes urine samples; (2) Auto Sampler Unit supplies samples to the
Main Unit automatically; (3) IPU (Information Processing Unit) which processes
data from the Main Unit and provides the operator interface with the system. The
UF-1000i is equipped with a Sampler that provides continuous automated
sampling for up to 50 tubes.
2. Principles of Operation:
The instrument utilizes Sysmex flow cytometry using a red semiconductor laser
for analyzing organized elements of urine particle characterization and
identification is based on detection of forward scatter, fluorescence, and adaptive
cluster analysis. Using its own reagents, the UF1000i automatically classifies
organized elements of urine and carries out all processes automatically from
aspiration of the sample to outputting the results.

1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy: The UF1000i was compared with the UF100. Specimens included
310 urine samples with various abnormal conditions and normal samples at three
outside clinical sites. Linear regression analysis was used for the correlation for
RBC, WBC, EC, and CAST parameters. Percent agreement was performed for the
Bacteria parameter. A new reference interval was established for the bacteria
parameter n the UF-1000i since there is a separate channel and additional stain in
the UF-1000i for bacteria detection. Therefore, a comparison between the UF-
1000i and UF-100 using each instrument’s bacteria reference interval as the cutoff

Within Run Urine Specimens: Within Run precision was determined on select
urine specimens each having a minimum volume of 50 mL which exceeded the
established Normal population Reference Range for the five enumerated
parameters (RBC, WBC, EC, CAST, Bacteria). The specimens were analyzed 10
times consecutively on the UF-1000i in the manual mode.
Conclusion: The within run precision on the five enumerated parameters were
acceptable.
d. Carryover: Carryover data was collected by analyzing a high sample three
consecutive times (H1, H2, H3) then analyzing a low sample three times (L1,
L2, L3). The formula (L1-L3)/ (H3-L3) x 100% was used where L1 is the first
low sample analyzed; L3 is the last low sample analyzed; and H3 is the last
high sample analyzed.
