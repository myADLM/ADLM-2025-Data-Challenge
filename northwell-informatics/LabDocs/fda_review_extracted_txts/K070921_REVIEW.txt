H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Applied DNA Technologies Bionexia™ hCG Pregnancy Cassette and
Dipstick Tests are rapid chromatographic immunoassays for the visual, qualitative
detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine at 20 mIU/mL and
above to help in the early determination of pregnancy.
The test kits are for health care professionals use including professionals at
physician’s office labs (POLs).
For a final Diagnosis of pregnancy, a more specific alternative clinical method
must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
This device is intended for prescription use (clinical laboratory and physician’s
office laboratory (POL) use).
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable, as the device is a visually-read single-use device.
I. Device Description:
The Bionexia™ hCG Pregnancy Tests are rapid chromatographic immunoassays for
the visual, qualitative detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine.
Each reagent strip contains mouse monoclonal anti-α-hCG antibody coated
membrane and a dried chemical pad containing mouse monoclonal anti-β-hCG
antibody colloidal gold conjugate. The control antibodies are goat anti-mouse IgG.
Both devices are single-use and visually read. One is a dipstick device and the other is
a cassette device.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Acon One Step Pregnancy Urine Test
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
k993203

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced
L. Test Principle:
The Bionexia™ hCG Pregnancy Cassette and Dipstick Tests are a competitive
binding immunoassay in which human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in a urine
sample competes with immobilized conjugate for limited labeled antibody binding
sites. When sufficient amount of sample is applied to the sample pad of the test
device, the sample migrates through the test device by capillary action. If the hCG
concentration in the sample is above the cutoff level, the antibody-hCG-antibody-
colloidal gold particles complex will form a colored line in the test band region, a
positive result. If the concentration of hCG in the sample is below the cutoff level it
will bind with antibodies conjugates with colloidal gold particles so that no line will
develop in the test region, a negative result. The colloidal gold antibody conjugate
should bind to the control region and form a colored band regardless of the presence
of hCG in the urine specimen.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Male urine samples were spiked with different concentrations of hCG (0, 10,
12.5, 15, 17.5, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 100 mIU/mL). 25 devices were tested
on each level using three different lots of the Bionexis hCG Pregnancy
Cassette and on one lot of Dipstick Tests. All the 0 and 10 mIU/mL test
samples were negative while all of the 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 100 mIU/mL
were all positive. The results of the weak negative testing are in the table
below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable this is a qualitative test.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The assay was standardized to the WHO Fourth International Standard.
d. Detection limit:
A 20mIU/mL cutoff is claimed for urine.
See Precision/Reproducibility section M.1.a above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Luteinizing hormone (300 mIU/mL), follicle stimulating hormone (1000
mIU/ml) and thyroid stimulating hormone (1000 μIU/mL) were added to hCG
negative and hCG positive (20 mIU/mL hCG added) pooled negative urine
split into six aliquots. None of the substances at the concentrations tested
interfered with the assay.
Commonly found substances (Prescription, OTC, chemical and biological
analytes – listed in the package insert) were added to hCG negative and hCG
positive (20 mIU/mL). No interference was observed at the concentrations
tested.
The “hook” effect was tested by spiking hCG control specimens at the
following hCG concentrations 0, 10, 20, 100, 62,500, 125,000, 250,000,
500,000, 1,000,000 and 2,000,000 mIU/mL. All samples tested up to
2,000,000 mIU/mL showed 100% expected results, indicating the absence of a
hook affect up to 2,000,000 mIU/mL.
Negative and positive (20 mIU/mL) urine samples were tested with specific
gravity ranging from 1.00 to 1.03 and pH ranging from 3.0 to 8.5 and shown
not to affect the results at these levels.
