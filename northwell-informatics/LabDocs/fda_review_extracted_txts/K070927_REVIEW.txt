2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
HemosIL D-Dimer HS was used in a multi-center management study
involving 668 samples from patients admitted consecutively to the emergency
unit with suspected DVT or PE. 307 patients were suspected of DVT and 361
patients were suspected of PE.
The Wells model was used to assess PTP (pre-test probability) score. The
patients were classified as having a high, moderate, or low probability of DVT
or PE.
• Patients with a negative D-Dimer test result and a low PTP score
underwent no further diagnostic testing and were followed-up after 3
months for development of DVT or PE.
• For patients with a negative D-Dimer test result and a moderate PTP, it
was the physician’s decision whether to follow-up after 3 months or to
undergo imaging techniques. Data indicated that all patients with a
negative D-Dimer test and a moderate PTP received either 3 months of
follow-up, or imaging with 3 months of follow-up if the imaging result
was negative.
• Patients with a positive D-Dimer test result or a high PTP score were
imaged.
• As of the 3 month follow-up, none of the patients that were negative
through D-Dimer testing had developed DVT or PE.

Previously established clinical cutoff of 230 ng/mL for HemosIL D-Dimer HS
(K050544) was used for calculation. Statistical evaluation of the respective
data sets from the four sites was performed using analysis of variance
(ANOVA) to verify whether the three PE sites could be pooled and the three
DVT sites could be pooled. The result was within acceptable limit (p>0.05).
• DVT samples: Of the 307 total DVT suspected patients (179 females, 128
males). The overall prevalence of DVT in the total population of samples
was 20.2% (62/307).
• PE samples: Of 361 total PE suspected patients (204 females, 157 males).
The overall prevalence of PE in the total population of samples was 16.1%
(58/361).
The sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) of HemosIL
D-Dimer HS for DVT and PE is summarized below with the corresponding
