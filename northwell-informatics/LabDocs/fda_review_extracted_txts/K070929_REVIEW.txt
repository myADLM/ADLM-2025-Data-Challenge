L. Test Principle:
The U120 Urine Analyzer is a reflectance photometer that analyzes the intensity and color of
light reflected from the reagent areas of a urinalysis reagent strip. Using a light emitting
diode (LED) as the light source and a photodiode as a light sensor, the optical system reads
the color change in the urine test strips after a sample is applied.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision evaluation included 10 replications on two levels of controls, using
three instruments and three lot numbers. The contingency table 2x2 is applied to
evaluate the total agreement, in term of percentage, on each parameter. The expected
values of the control material were used to determine the agreement between the
samples.

d. Detection limit:
The sensitivity of the assay when read by the ACON U120 Urine Analyzer was
validated by spiking positive urine samples of known concentrations for each analyte.
These positive samples of each analyte were then diluted to the lowest “positive”
concentrations indicated on the ACON color chart. For each analyte, aliquots of the
lowest positive samples were further diluted to 80%, 60% of the originals with
negative urine. Each urine sample was tested with three lots of the ACON Urinalysis
Reagent Strips on three analyzers. For three consecutive days, each sample was tested
15 times per day. A total of 135 strips were used for each concentration tested (3
analyzers x 3 days x 5 strips x 3 lots = 135 strips). The minimum sensitivity level for
each analyte of the ACON Urinalysis Reagent Strips when read by the analyzer is
defined by the sponsor as the lowest level at which over 55% of the test results are
positive when the diluted positive samples for an analyte of known concentrations
were tested. The results of each analyte sensitivity pad are summarized below.
