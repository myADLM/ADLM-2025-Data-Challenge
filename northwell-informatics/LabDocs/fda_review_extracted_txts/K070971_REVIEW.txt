4. Panel:
75, Chemistry
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Clinical Chemistry- The Sentinel Clin Chem Cal is a device intended for medical
purposes for use in Pancreatic amylase, cholinesterase, creatinine, lithium, alpha-
hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and “cholinesterase dibucaine-inhibited” assays
to establish points of reference that are used in the determination of values in the
measurement of pancreatic amylase, cholinesterase, creatinine, lithium, alpha-
hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and “cholinesterase dibucaine-inhibited” in
human specimens.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Abbott Aeroset and Abbott Architect Analyzers
I. Device Description:
The Sentinel Clin Chem Cal is an in vitro diagnostic device intended for use in
pancreatic amylase, cholinesterase, creatinine, lithium, alpha-hydroxybutyrate
dehydrogenase and “cholinesterase dibucaine-inhibited” assays to establish points
of reference that are used in the determination of values in the measurement of
pancreatic amylase, cholinesterase, creatinine, lithium, alpha-hydroxybutyrate
dehydrogenase and “cholinesterase dibucaine-inhibited” in human specimens. The
device consists of lyophilized material in human based serum. The human serum
used has been tested and found to be non-reactive for HBsAg, anti-HIV 1/2 and
anti-HCV.

Values are assigned in-house on commercially marketed clinical chemistry
analyzers. Each testing run evaluates triplicates of the following: two levels
of control materials (low and high), an aliquot of internal master lot and two
aliquots of two pools of calibrator materials. Four runs on at least two
different days are performed. The mean and the standard deviation of the two
calibrator pools were calculated. The assigned value was determined to be the
mean of the two calibrator pools barring any outlier and imprecision of less
that 4.5%.
The sponsors’ results support the shelf-life stability claim of up to 24 month
and a reconstituted stability material claim of 2 days at 2 to 8°C or 14 days at -
20°C when stored in small volumes and frozen once.
