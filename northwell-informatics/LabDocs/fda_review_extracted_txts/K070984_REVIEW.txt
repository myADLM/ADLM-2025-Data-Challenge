--- Page 2 ---
See Indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Precision® and Optium® Point of Care Blood Test Strips quantitatively
measure glucose (D-glucose) in fresh neonatal, venous, arterial, and fingertip
capillary whole blood. The test strips are for use outside the body (in vitro
diagnostic use) by healthcare professionals for use in healthcare facilities with
either the Precision Xtra or Optium Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems. Home
users may use the system for capillary samples only. The test strips are not for use
in diagnosis or screening of diabetes mellitus, but to be used as an aid in
monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes control programs.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For professional and home use
In the package insert the manufacturer has stated the following limitations:
1. “If the test fails to start, sufficient blood sample may not have been applied to
the test strip. Discard the current test strip, and repeat with new strip.”
2. “Xylose may produce falsely elevated glucose results during a xylose
absorption test for diagnostic evaluation of malabsorption”
3. Test results may be erroneously low if the patient is severely dehydrated,
severely hypotensive, in shock or in a hyperglycemic-hyperosmolar state (with
or without ketosis). Similar observations have been reported in the literature
for other blood glucose monitoring systems.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Precision Xtra or Optium Blood Glucose meter (the sponsor claims that these meters are
identical except for the name).

catalyzed reaction with Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD). The reduced
form of NAD (NADH) is re-oxidized by reaction with the electrochemical mediator,
1,10 phenanthroline quinine (1,10PQ). The reduced mediator is re-oxidized via
electron transfer at the electrode surface. This current is translated into a number by
the meter, after applying lot specific information from the ROM calibrator and after a
20 second count-down; a concentration value is then presented to the user.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study were performed to assess the precision and repeatability of the
Precision POC modified test strips responses using venous whole blood concentrations
between 30 and 350 mg/dL (spiked samples). Blood samples were collected from
healthy donors into tubes that contained heparin. Four Precision meters and three lots of
blood glucose test strips were tested with 20 replicates on one day. The precision of all
three lots of the test strips was shown below:
Level Mean of glucose Within-run (SD) % CV
(mg/dL)
1 29.9 1.5 5.0
2 51.0 1.8 3.6
3 92.3 3.1 3.4
4 140.2 4.6 3.3
5 217.9 6.7 3.1
6 343.7 10.2 3.0
In addition, precision and repeatability of the modified test strips were tested with
controls solutions (low, mid, and high). Four Precision meters and three lots of strips
were tested in duplicate for each glucose control solution for 20 days. The precision of
all three lots of the test strips was shown below:

High 272.9 3.2 4.2 1.5
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed using capillary whole blood samples collected
from 24 donors. The capillary samples were spiked to varying glucose
concentrations, distributed throughout the testing range. Three lots of blood

glucose test strips were tested in duplicate with each blood sample. Ranges of
samples tested were from 26 to 495 mg/dL. YSI glucose analyzer was used as a
reference method. The linear regression of all three lots is shown below:
Y= 0.98X – 3.0, r = 0.995, N=288, (X=YSI method, Y=Meter)
In addition, the sponsor performed a dynamic range study to evaluate the
glucose values at the extreme ranges. Glucose levels at concentrations of 10, 20,
500, 600, and 700 mg/dL were tested between the YSI method and the glucose
meters. When the YSI glucose level tested at 24 mg/dL, the glucose meters read
22 mg/dL (N=30).
The dynamic range study and the linearity study support the sponsor’s claim
that the linearity range of the modified test strips is 20 to 500 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
No change to traceability. The Precision POC blood glucose test strip is
traceable to YSI which employs NIST SRM 917b reference material.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity/reportable range studies above.
e. Analytical specificity:
i.) An interference study was performed to determine the effect of 27 potential
interference substances. Blood samples were obtained in heparinized tubes,
pooled and then spiked to a glucose level of approximately 100 mg/dL.
Stock solutions of the potential interferents were prepared and spiked into
the tested pool sample with different concentrations. The % bias was
calculated based on the differences between the spiked sample and the
control pool sample. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion is ≤13% bias for not
significant interference. All the interference substances tested met the
sponsor’s acceptance criterion except for xylose; therefore, the sponsor put a
warning in the limitation section of the package insert.
“Xylose may produce falsely elevated glucose results during a xylose absorption test
for diagnostic evaluation of malabsorption”
ii.) A hematocrit study was performed to evaluate the hematocrit variation effect
of the modified test strips. Oxygenated venous blood samples with up to 6
different Hct levels (10, 15, 20, 45, 55, and 70%) were prepared and used.
Four different glucose target concentrations of oxygenated venous blood
concentrations (35, 60, 90, and 400 mg/dL) were prepared. The % difference
between the glucose strips results and YSI results were calculated and
summarized as follows:

The sponsor claimed that the reportable hematocrit range was 20%-70% for the
modified glucose test strips.
iii.) An altitude study was performed to determine the accuracy of the modified
strips at 7,200 ft above sea level. Capillary samples were taken from 63
subjects and tested on the Precision POC test strips and the YSI glucose
analyzer. The glucose concentration range tested was 48-410 mg/dL and the
hematocrit range was 31-56 %. The Passing Bablok regressions results were
as follows:
Results (Y) vs. YSI reference method (X):
Y = 0.91X + 5.68, r = 0.98, N=54
The overall accuracy according to the ISO acceptance criteria were as follow:
98.1% (106/108) of results fall within ± 15 mg/dL of YSI reference at glucose
concentrations < 75mg/dL and within ± 20% of YSI reference at glucose
concentrations ≥75mg/dL.
iv.) A temperature and humidity testing was performed to determine the effects of
variation in temperature and humidity on the response of Precision POC test strips
with spiked venous blood samples. Testing was conducted using six Precision
glucose meters against the YSI glucose analyzer. Three lots of blood glucose test
strips were tested with 12 replicate strips per blood glucose level (50, 90, and 350
mg/dL) and environmental condition (temperatures at 15, 25, and 40oC; humidity at
10, 50, and 90%). The % difference from the control condition (24oC/50%)
between the glucose strips results and YSI results were calculated and summarized
as follows:

The sponsor claimed that the temperature between 15-40 oC (59o-104oF) and
humidity between 10- 90% provides acceptable glucose results.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device and reference method:
183 lay persons with diabetes in three different clinics performed a finger-stick test
using the modified test strips on the Precision glucose meter. A trained operator then
performed a second finger-stick on the patient and tested on the same glucose meter. In
addition, the trained operator also performed a veni-puncture to obtain a venous sample
from the patient. Venous samples were analyzed on the YSI analyzer (reference
method). The glucose concentration range tested was 39-485 mg/dL and the hematocrit
range was 25-56 %. The linear regressions results were as follows:
Lay user’s results (Y) vs. YSI reference method (X):
Y = 0.94X + 1.64, r = 0.98, N=156
Trained operator’s results (Y) vs. YSI reference method (X):
Y = 0.92X + 2.78, r = 0.99, N=156
In addition, system accuracy based on ISO 15197 acceptance criteria was calculated.

b. Matrix comparison:
i.) Neonate blood samples were conducted with 175 patients in a clinic against a
laboratory plasma method. Capillary samples from the neonates were run in duplicate
with 3 different lots of test strips. The glucose concentration range tested was 31-123
mg/dL and the hematocrit range was 27-66%. The linear regressions results were as
follows:
Neonate capillary sample (Y) vs. laboratory plasma method (X):
Y = 1.08X – 13.70, r= 0.96, N=330
The overall accuracy according to the ISO acceptance criteria for the neonate samples
was as follow:
95.5% (315/330) of results fall within ± 15 mg/dL of YSI reference at
glucose concentrations < 75mg/dL and within ± 20% of YSI reference at
glucose concentrations ≥75mg/dL.
Since the neonatal clinical samples did not cover the claimed measuring range, results
from a study of spiked samples with high glucose concentrations and varying
hematocrits were provided by the sponsor to demonstrate acceptable performance
using ISO acceptance criteria. See Hematocrit study above.
ii.) Venous blood samples using EDTA and heparin samples were conducted with 144
patients against the YSI reference method. The glucose concentration range tested was
70-540 mg/dL (by YSI) and the hematocrit range was 20-50%. The Passing Bablok

The overall accuracy according to the ISO acceptance criteria for the EDTA
samples was as follow:
98.9% (564/570) of results fall within ± 15 mg/dL of YSI reference at
glucose concentrations < 75mg/dL and within ± 20% of YSI reference at
glucose concentrations ≥75mg/dL.
The overall accuracy according to the ISO acceptance criteria for the heparin
samples was as follow:
98.7% (545/552) of results fall within ± 15 mg/dL of YSI reference at
glucose concentrations < 75mg/dL and within ± 20% of YSI reference at
glucose concentrations ≥75mg/dL.
iii.) Arterial blood samples were conducted with 120 patients in a clinic against a
laboratory method and the YSI reference method. The glucose concentration
range tested was 43-311 mg/dL (by YSI) and the hematocrit range was 19-50%.
The linear regressions results were as follows:
