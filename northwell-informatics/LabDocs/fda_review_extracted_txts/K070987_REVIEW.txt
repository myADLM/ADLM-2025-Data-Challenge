K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI documents: “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement
Methods” EP5-A; “Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples”

EP17-A.
L. Test Principle:
The assay is a spectrophotometric method for use on automated clinical chemistry
analyzers. Lithium present in the sample reacts with a substituted porphyrin compound at
an alkaline pH, resulting in a change in absorbance, proportional to the concentration of
lithium in the sample.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was performed over 20 days per CLSI EP5-A. The
samples evaluated included two commercial control sera (Level 1, Level 2)
and a human serum pool (Level 3). The latter was spiked with a solution of
lithium-lactate to reach a concentration of 1.5 mMol/L. These samples were
tested on the AEROSET and ARCHITECT c8000 in replicates of two, twice
per day (separated by a minimum of two hours), for twenty days using one
instrument. Results are shown below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated with samples prepared from human serum pools. A
lithium-spiked aliquot was serially diluted with an un-spiked aliquot to obtain
a set of at least eleven samples with proportionally decreased concentrations
of lithium. Each dilution point was tested in triplicate. The deviation from the
linear model for each sample was determined by dividing the mean observed
result by the theoretical value. Results below support the sponsor’s linearity

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators and control materials were cleared previously (k070971).
d. Detection limit:
A limit of quantitation evaluation was performed using human serum spiked with
low concentrations of lithium. The criteria for limit of quantitation are defined by
the manufacturer as the lowest concentration of analyte at which imprecision is <
20% CV and non-linearity within +/- 0.075 mMol/L. Measurements were from 3
runs per instrument, 7 samples per run. Data in the 510(k) support the claim for
the low limit of the reportable range of 0.10 mMol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
The compounds and ions listed below were spiked into a human serum pool
containing lithium. A series of samples containing increasing concentrations of
the potential interferents were tested in triplicate, and the median was determined.
Results were evaluated relative to reference samples (i.e., the lithium samples
without the potential interferents). The compounds and the highest concentrations
for which bias was less than < +/-0.075 mMol/L, or <+/-5% (manufacturer’s
criteria) are shown below:

Collection tubes evaluated by the manufacturer included serum, EDTA, SST, and
sodium heparin. Samples obtained from 5 subjects, were tested with each of the
collection tubes evaluated. For each pool, 5 replicates were measured for each

concentrations exceeding the recommended therapeutic range. Relative to serum,
the mean bias for the other anticoagulants did not exceed +/- 5%, or 0.075
mMol/L.
