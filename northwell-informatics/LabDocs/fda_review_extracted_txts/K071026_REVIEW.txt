H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The BD GeneOhm™ StaphSR Assay is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for
the rapid detection of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) directly from positive blood culture. The assay
utilizes polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the amplification of specific targets
and fluorogenic target-specific hybridization probes for the real-time detection of

--- Page 2 ---
the amplified DNA.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The assay is performed on Gram positive cocci, identified by Gram stain, from
positive blood cultures.
The BD GeneOhm™ StaphSR Assay is not intended to monitor treatment for
MRSA/SA infections. Subculturing of positive blood cultures is necessary for
further susceptibility testing.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Automated SmartCycler® System (instrument, software)
I. Device Description:
The amplified DNA targets are detected with molecular beacon probes, hairpin-forming
single stranded oligonucleotides labeled at one end with a quencher and at the other end
with a fluorescent reporter dye (fluorophore). In the absence of target, the fluorescence is
quenched. In the presence of target, the hairpin structure opens upon beacon/target
hybridization, resulting in emission of fluorescence. For the detection of MRSA
amplicon, the molecular beacon probe contains the fluorophore FAM at the 5’ end and
the non-fluorescent quencher moiety DABCYL at the opposite end of the
oligonucleotide. For the detection of S. aureus amplicon, the molecular beacon probe is
labeled with the fluorophore TexasRed at the 5’ end and the quencher DABCYL at the 3’
end. For the detection of the Internal Control (IC) amplicon, the molecular beacon probe
contains the fluorophore TET at the 5’ end and the quencher DABCYL at the 3’ end.
Each beacon-target hybrid fluoresces at a wavelength characteristic of the fluorophore
used in the particular molecular beacon probe. The amount of fluorescence at any given
cycle, or following cycling, depends on the amount of specific amplicon present at that
time. The SmartCycler® software simultaneously monitors the fluorescence emitted by
each beacon probe, interprets all data, and provides a final result at the end of the cycling
program. The whole procedure takes about 60-75 minutes.
The following controls were used for monitoring assay performance and included in the
assay kit:
• Internal control (IC) monitors the presence of inhibitory substances in the
assay tube, also ensures that reaction conditions (temperature, time) of
each step of the PCR in that tube are appropriate for the amplification
reaction and that the reagents are functional. IC is also a reagent control.
• Positive control (PC) is an assay run control. It is used in combination
with the internal control to verify reagent and system functionality.
• Negative control (NC) is an assay run control, used to detect reagent or

environmental contamination (or carry-over) by either S. aureus or MRSA
DNA or amplicons.

of beads and heat at 95 ± 2ºC). Without additional manipulation to purify the DNA
present in the lysate, an aliquot of the lysate is added directly to the PCR master mix in a
SmartCycler® reaction tube. The reaction tubes are placed in the SmartCycler®
instrument. In specimens containing MRSA or SA, amplification of the targets [MRSA: a
S. aureus specific target and a sequence near the insertion site of the Staphylococcal
Cassette Chromosome mec (SCCmec); SA: another S. aureus specific sequence] occurs.
Amplification of the IC, a DNA fragment not found in S. aureus or MRSA, also takes
place unless PCR inhibitory substances are present.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was assessed with three (3) lots of BD GeneOhm™ StaphSR
Assay kit lots representing different Master Mix lots. The panel consisted of 12
tubes (labeled R1 to R12) containing 50 μL of a positive blood culture with either
MRSA type ii, MSSA or a negative specimen (Staphylococcus epidermidis).
Panel members were tested in triplicate on three (3) days at three (3) sites (12
specimens plus 2 kit controls tested x 3 x 3 days x 3 sites).
Inter-sites and across lots demonstrated >95% reproducibility.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls
Assay controls were performed satisfactorily at each site demonstrating
acceptable QC results for the majority of runs. External specimen processing
controls (S. aureus ATCC 43300 for MRSA, and S. aureus ATCC 25923)
were also performed. Data demonstrated acceptable QC results for the
majority of runs.
.
Additional positive control strains that represent MRSA MERJ iii and MERJ
vii were recommended to test probes and primers that were not controlled
directly in the assay.
Assay Stability
Real-time and accelerated stability studies are ongoing for the BD
GeneOhmTM StaphSR Assay when stored under 5±3ºC, 25±2ºC, 35±2ºC and
45±2ºC. Master Mix and Control DNA were evaluated at predefined time

--- Page 8 ---
point intervals. Additionally, assay component pouches being stored at 5±3ºC
that have been opened and resealed to mimic use were tested at specific pre-
defined time points. The sealed pouches were stable for 12 weeks at 35±2ºC
and 45±2ºC under accelerated storage conditions. The opened pouches were
stable at 5±2ºC for four weeks.
The shelf life for the lysis kit (beads) was twelve months at 25±2ºC or at
5±3ºC. The Sample buffer was stable for twelve months in closed bags at 21-
25ºC and at 2-8 ºC in opened and closed bags.
Specimen stability
Viability and amplifiability studies demonstrated that viable bacteria (by
colony counts) and amplifiable DNA (by BD GeneOhm™ StaphSR Assay)
were recoverable after a storage period of 18 hours for BacT/ALERT media,
30 hours for BACTEC media at 35ºC, and three days at room temperature
(15-25ºC).
A total of eight lysates (low, medium and high positive lysates), which were
freeze-thawed for a minimum of two times, were tested. Results
demonstrated that they were stable at -20ºC for at least two years.
d. Detection limit:
Bacterial Limit of Detection (LOD)
Broth serial dilutions of 102, 103, and 104 of S. aureus were prepared from
TSB culture. Precise viable cell numbers were determined by plating 50 μL of
the bacterial serial dilutions in triplicate on Columbia Blood agar plates for
MSSA and on Müeller-Hinton agar + 6mg/L of oxacillin for MRSA. After
overnight incubation, the colony count was performed. For each dilution, an
average of the three plates was calculated. Each bacterial dilution then was
tested using the BD GeneOhmTM StaphSR Assay.
The final MRSA LOD is 9 CFU/reaction. The final bacterial LOD for MSSA
is 1 CFU/reaction. The sponsor has chosen to claim a bacterial LOD of 10
CFU/reaction for both MRSA and MSSA.
DNA LOD
Seven strains of MRSA and two strains of MSSA were plated on sheep blood
agar and genomic DNA was extracted from the pure cultures. Each genomic
DNA dilution then was tested. Results indicate a final LOD of 15 DNA
copies/reaction for MRSA and a final LOD of 5 DNA copies/reaction for
MSSA. However, the sponsor has chosen to claim a genomic LOD of 15
DNA copies/reaction for both MRSA and MSSA.

--- Page 9 ---
The High Target Concentration Interference study demonstrated that the
presence of MSSA at a 500:1 (MSSA: MRSA) or 1000:1 ratio, the LOD for
MREJ type ii mut16 and type iii was 30 copies/reaction instead of 15
copies/reaction.
Additionally, 100 MRSA (MREJ genotypes i, ii, iii, iv, v, vii) strains
(representing 29 countries) and 199 MSSA strains (representing 18 countries)
from well characterized clinical isolates or public collections were evaluated.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross- reactivity Study:
Purified DNA or culture lysates from 99 strains representing 33 coagulase-
negative Staphylococcus strains (representing 25 species), 66 non-
Staphylococcal species, and human DNA were tested. The non-
Staphylococcal species were from well characterized clinical isolates or public
collections. They were commonly isolated bacterial pathogens (aerobes,
anaerobes, Helicobacter spp, and Bordetella pertusis), yeast, Actinomyces
spp, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycobacterium gordonae and normal human
skin/mucus flora.
All DNA were diluted with sample buffer to obtain approximately 1 ng (3x105
CFU) of purified genomic DNA per PCR reaction. All assay tubes were
analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to further assess if an amplicon had
been produced.
The specificity with closely related organisms was >95%.
f. Assay cut-off:
A multi-site investigational study was conducted on 701 (156 MRSA, 159
MSSA, 386 non S. aureus) positive blood cultures to establish the acceptance
criteria. A total of 414 PC and 414 NC were also conducted in the same

--- Page 10 ---
investigational study.
The following table demonstrates the acceptance criteria to distinguish a
positive result from a negative result which is required for the interpretation of
data.
Acceptance Criteria for BD GeneOhm™ StaphSR Assay
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Culture was performed on positive blood bottles presenting bacterial growth of
Gram positive cocci within 36 hours of being declared positive by the instrument.
It consisted of an initial analysis on a blood agar plate after an overnight
incubation. Presumptive colonies of S. aureus were confirmed with either a latex
agglutination assay, tube coagulase testing, or an automated identification system.
Confirmed colonies were tested for methicillin resistance using oxacillin screen
agar, PBP2’ latex agglutination test, or an automated antimicrobial susceptibility
testing system using appropriate panels.
Different testing algorithms were used at each site and percent agreement was
used for data analysis.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not Applicable
3. Clinical studies:
A total of 1183 compliant positive blood bottles at five sites (three US and two
Canadian) were tested for SA and MRSA with the standard culture method and
the BD GeneOhm™ StaphSR Assay. Specimens were tested with the culture
technique within 36 hours and with the StaphSR Assay within 72 hours of
positivity of the blood bottle. The tables below demonstrated the performance of
the assay.
