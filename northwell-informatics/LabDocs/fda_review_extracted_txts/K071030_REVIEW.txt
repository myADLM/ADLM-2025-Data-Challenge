L. Test Principle:
The Bionexia hCG Pregnancy Serum/Urine Cassette and dipstick test is a
chromatographic immunoassay for the rapid qualitative determination of human
chorionic gonadotropin in urine and serum specimens. The anti-Alpha hCG pre-
coated membrane captures antibodies on the test band region and goat anti-mouse on
the control band region. The specimen is allowed to react with anti-beta hCG
monoclonal antibody. The mixture moves upward via capillary action. For a positive
result, a colored band with a specific antibody- hCG-antibody-colloidal gold particle
complex will form on the membrane in the test band region. The absence of a
colored band in the test band region indicates a negative result.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor used five levels of male pooled urine and serum specimens
spiked with hCG (WHO Fourth International Standard). Twenty-five devices
from three cassette lots and one dipstick lot were tested for each hCG level
tested (0, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5 20, 25, 30, 35, 40,and 100 mIU/mL) of serum and
urine controls.

40 0/75 0/75 0/25 0/25
100 0/75 0/75 0/25 0/25
The sponsor has chosen a cutoff of 20 mIU/mL based on the above study.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The test is traceable to a test that has been standardized to the WHO Fourth
International Standard.
The sponsor established the shelf life and expiration date (closed unopened
product) when stored refrigerated (2-8˚ C) or at room temperature (up to 30˚
C) in the sealed pouch for the duration of the shelf life. The sponsors claimed
shelf life is 30 months.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit for the ADT’s Bionexia hCG Pregnancy Serum/Urine
Cassette and Dipstick Test was evaluated in both the reproducibility study and
a hook effect study. The sponsor determined that the cutoff is 20 mIU/mL.

e. Analytical specificity:
Pooled negative serum and urine specimens were collected, divided into six
aliquots each and were supplemented with either 300 mIU/mL luteinizing
hormone (hLH), 1000 mIU/mL follicle stimulating (hFSH) or 1000 mIU/mL
thyroid stimulating hormone (hTSH) at 0 and 20 mIU/mL hCG levels.
Duplicates of each sample were tested using the ADT’s Bionexia hCG
Pregnancy Serum/Urine Cassette and the results were read. The results
demonstrated no unexpected results with the above-listed hormones in the
urine or serum samples.
Prescription, OTC drugs, chemical and biological analytes were added to
negative (0 mIU/mL) and positive (20 mIU/mL) spiked urine and serum
pools. None of the substances tested at the concentrations listed in the
package insert interfered in the assay.
Six urine specimens with varying hCG levels were altered to the following
pH: normal, 3, 5, 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5 for two hCG levels (0 and 20 mIU/mL) and
were tested with six devices. The samples were read and gave all negative
results at 0 mIU/mL and all positive results at 20 mIU/mL of hCG.
A urine specific gravity study was conducted on negative urine samples with
specicific gravity ranging from 1.00 to 1.03 spiked to the following levels: 0
and 20 mIU/mL. Each sample level was tested 6 times with the ADT’s
Bionexia hCG Pregnancy Serum/Urine Cassette and Dipstick Test. The
sponsor’s results support the sponsor’s claim that the negative and cutoff
levels are not affected by differences in specific gravity.
A hook effect study was conducted with spiked hCG serum control specimens
that were tested with two cassettes for each of the following concentrations: 0,
10, 12.5, 15, 17.5 20, 25, 30, 35, 200, 62500, 125000, 250000, 500000, 1
million and 2 million mIU/mL. The results showed that each level indicated
100% agreement in both negative and positive results and that there was no
observed hook effect up to 2 million mIU/mL hCG.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cutoff for this device is 20 mIU/mL.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The ADT’s Bionexia hCG Pregnancy Serum/Urine Cassette and Dipstick Test
device was evaluated at 3 clinical/professional sites by users with training
typical for physician’s office labs to ascertain the products accuracy and
reproducibility as compared to the predicate. Site one tested 19 positive and
27 negative serum samples. Site two tested 29 positive and 20 negative
serum samples. Site one tested 18 positive and 27 negative urine samples and
site two tested 29 positive and 20 negative urine samples.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Negative results are expected in healthy non-pregnant women and healthy men.
Healthy pregnant women have hCG present in their urine and serum specimens.
The amount of hCG will vary greatly with gestational age and between
individuals.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
