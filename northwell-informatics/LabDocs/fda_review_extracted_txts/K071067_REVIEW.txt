BACTRACK breathalyzer
I. Device Description:
The BACTRACK™ Breathalyzer is designed to work with a simple one button
operation. The BACTRACK™ Breathalyzer operates on two AA Alkaline batteries.
The battery lasts for approximately 300 tests. There is a low battery which lights an
LCD on the front panel when the voltage goes too low. The BACTRACK™
Breathalyzer sensor uses tin dioxide which has n-type conductivity when exposed to
the atmosphere. This exposure causes a decrease in the number of electrons effecting
absorbed oxygen molecules and thus increases resistance. If a specific gas (reducing
gas) is presented, a reaction occurs with the absorbed oxygen which causes an
increase in the electrons in the oxide molecules causing a decrease in resistance. This
change in resistance can be measured and used to identify a specific gas (such as
alcohol) and can be quantified into a % concentration.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
The sponsor states conformance to the following standards:
1. Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration [NHTSA Docket No. 94-004; Notice 2] Highway Safety
Programs; Model Specifications for Screening Devices to Measure Alcohol in
Bodily Fluids
2. IEC 60601-1, Safety of Medical Electrical Equipment, Part 1, General
Requirements for Safety, including Amendment 1 and 2
3. EN 61000-6-3:2001+A11:2004 & EN 61000-6-3:2001. Electromagnetic

L. Test Principle:
The BACTRACK™ Breathalyzer is designed to measure deep lung air to test for the
presence of alcohol in the blood. The relationship between alcohol in the blood and
alcohol in the deep lung breath is well established by Henry’s law in a ratio of 2100:1
The BACTRACK™ Breathalyzer has been tested and uses a blow time of 5 seconds
to capture an accurate deep lung sample. The BACTRACK™ Breathalyzer sensor
uses tin dioxide which has n-type conductivity when exposed to the atmosphere. This
exposure causes a decrease in the number of electrons affecting absorbed oxygen
molecules and thus increases resistance. If a specific gas (reducing gas) is presented,
a reaction occurs with the absorbed oxygen which causes an increase in the electrons
in the oxide molecules causing a decrease in resistance. This change in resistance can
be measured and used to identify a specific gas (such as alcohol) and can be
quantified into a % concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
This device was not tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA). The sponsor performed their own testing and
collected performance data using the NHTSA requirements for precision and
accuracy as a guide. These requirements (referred to as Model Specifications)
consist of 20 trials at a Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of 0.008, 20 trials
at a BAC of 0.032, and 20 trials at a BAC of 0.000. Blood Alcohol
Concentrations are simulated in breath by a Breath Alcohol Sample Simulator
(BASS), which provides an alcohol-in-air test sample with known alcohol

concentrations, flow rate, and air composition. The acceptance criteria for the
Model Specifications are: not more than one negative result at 0.032 BAC, not
more than one positive result at 0.008 BAC, and not more than one negative
greater than zero and no positives at 0.000 BAC. NOTE: for the purposes of
this study, a BAC of 0.020 is used to distinguish a positive from a negative
result. The BACKTRACK™ Breathalyzer Digital Alcohol Detector device
had no negatives at 0.032 BAC, no positives at 0.008 BAC, and no positives
at 0.000 BAC.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
This device will report concentrations from 0.000 to 0.400%. However,
DOT/NHTSA Model Specifications require accuracy and precision testing at
concentrations of 0.008 and 0.032 only; therefore true linearity was not
evaluated. This device demonstrated acceptable performance according to the
Model Specifications as described above.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device is traceable to a commercially available certified alcohol reference
solution at a concentration of 0.06 % BAC. This solution is used to calibrate
the devices during manufacture.
d. Detection limit:
The DOT/NHTSA Model Specifications do not specifically address the
detection limit of breath alcohol devices. However, the devices must be tested
at a BAC of zero (blank reading) to assess the possibility of false positives.
This consists of 20 trials under normal laboratory conditions using fluorescent
light at a BAC of 0.000. Non-alcoholic human breath is to be used as the
sample. For devices capable of providing a reading of greater than 0.000
BAC and less than 0.020 BAC, the acceptance criterion is: not more than one
such result. The BACKTRACK™ Breathalyzer Digital Alcohol Detector had
no false positives in this trial.
e. Analytical specificity:
The DOT/NHTSA Model Specifications require testing with cigarette smoke
to assess any possible interference. Five trials are required at 0.000 BAC. An
alcohol-free individual who smokes cigarettes is appropriate for this trial. The
subject is asked to smoke approximately one half of a cigarette. Within one
minute after smoking, or after a waiting period specified in the manufacturer’s
instructions*, the subject performs the breath alcohol test according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The subject is then asked to smoke another
inhalation and repeat the test to produce a total of five trials. The acceptance
criterion for this trial is: no positive results. The BACKTRACK™
Breathalyzer Digital Alcohol Detector had no positive results.
*Manufacturer’s labeling instructs the user to wait 20 minutes after smoking,
eating, or drinking before taking a reading.

f. Temperature:
The DOT/NHTSA Model Specifications require testing at 10 and 40o C to
assess any possible effects of temperature.
At 10o C, 20 trials are required at 0.008 BAC and 20 trials are required at
0.032 BAC. Acceptance criteria are: not more than one positive result at
0.008 BAC, and not more than one non-positive result at 0.032 BAC. The
BACKTRACK™ Breathalyzer Digital Alcohol Detector had no positive
results at 0.008 BAC and no non-positive results at 0.032 BAC.
At 40o C, the requirements are identical. In this study the BACKTRACK™
Breathalyzer Digital Alcohol Detector had no positive results at 0.008 BAC
and no non-positive results at 0.032 BAC.
g. Vibration:
The DOT/NHTSA Model Specifications require vibration testing to assess
any possible vibrational effects.
Twenty trials are required at 0.008 BAC and 0.032 BAC. Acceptance criteria
are: not more than one positive result at 0.008 BAC, and not more than one
non-positive result at 0.032 BAC. The BACKTRACK™ Breathalyzer Digital
Alcohol Detector had no positive results at 0.008 BAC and no non-positive
results at 0.032 BAC.
h. Assay cutoff:
For the purposes of DOT performance testing, a BAC cutoff of 0.020 was
used to distinguish positive from negative samples.
As of June 7, 2004, 49 states, along with the District of Columbia and Puerto
Rico, have adopted .08 BAC as the legal level of intoxication in their state.
Only Delaware remains at .10 BAC as the legally established level for drunk
driving.
In their labeling, the sponsor states that driving skills may be impaired at a
BAC of 0.04 - 0.06 and are always impaired at a BAC of 0.07 - 0.09.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The accuracy of this device is addressed in the precision section above. In
addition, the sponsor conducted a consumer study comparing the
BACKTRACK™ Breathalyzer Digital Alcohol Detector to a professional
breath alcohol device. The purpose of the study was to determine if
consumers could correctly use and interpret the device using only the supplied
User’s Manual, and to compare the results to the professional device. There
were 85 paired comparisons, and the volunteers ranged in age from 21 to 60
years of age. Each participant took their own breath alcohol reading with the
BACKTRACK™ Breathalyzer Digital Alcohol Detector and recorded the
result. Immediately afterward, the participants were administered a breath
5

--- Page 6 ---
alcohol test using a Lifeloc Model FC-10 operated by a trained individual.
The breath alcohol concentrations ranged from a BAC of 0.000 to 0.136 (by
the professional device). Linear regression analysis of the data yielded a slope
of 0.90491, a y-intercept of 0.00383, and a correlation coefficient of 0.904.

N. Instrument Name:
BACKTRACK™ Breathalyzer Digital Alcohol Detector
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Manually the user presses and holds the power button for one full second. After
powering on, the unit will count down from 50 to zero. This countdown takes
approximately 10 seconds. When the countdown approaches 10, the user is
instructed to begin to inhale a deep breath. When the countdown reaches zero, the
unit will flash “blow” and “0”. The user exhales through the dual-flow breath
chamber for five seconds while holding it 1/2 inch (13 mm) away from the mouth.
When finished taking a breath sample, the BACTRACK will circle the outer LCD
fields for three seconds while analyzing the breath sample. Once the
BACTRACK has analyzed the breath sample, the estimated BAC (Blood alcohol
content) value is displayed. The test result will be displayed for 10 seconds. Then
the test result will blink for another 10 seconds before shutting off.
