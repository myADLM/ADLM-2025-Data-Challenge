H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
TRU RSV is a rapid, qualitative, lateral-flow immunoassay for the detection of
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) antigens (fusion protein or nucleoprotein) in
human nasal wash, nasopharyngeal aspirate, and nasal and nasopharyngeal swab
samples. It is designed to test specimens from symptomatic patients aged 5 years
or less. A negative result does not preclude RSV infection. It is recommended
that all negative test results be confirmed by cell culture.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable.
I. Device Description:
TRU RSV is a single use capture immunoassay to detect RSV antigen in human
respiratory samples. The test consists of a Conjugate Tube, a Test Strip and Sample
Diluent. The Conjugate Tube contains a lyophilized bead of colloidal gold-linked
monoclonal antibodies to RSV fusion protein and nucleoprotein (detector antibodies).
Test Strip carries a nitrocellulose membrane with dried capture antibodies placed at a
designated Test Line for RSV. The Test Strip holder caps the Conjugate Tube during
testing and subsequent disposal to reduce exposure to potential pathogens.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Not applicable.
L. Test Principle:
The conjugate bead is first re-hydrated in the Conjugate Tube with Sample Diluent.
Patient sample is then added, the contents mixed and the Test Strip added. If RSV
antigens are present, they first bind to the monoclonal antibody-colloidal gold
conjugate. When the sample migrates up the Test Strip to the Test Line, the antigen-
conjugate complex is bound to the capture antibody, yielding a pink-red line. When
no antigen is present, no complexes are formed and no pink-red line appears at the
Test Line. An internal control line helps determine whether adequate flow has
occurred through the Test Strip during a test run. A visible pink-red line at the
Control position of the Test Strip should be present each time a specimen or control is
tested. If no pink-red control line is seen, the test is considered invalid.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i. Assay precision, intra-assay variability and inter-assay variability were
assessed with a reference panel prepared from poolsof negative samples
spiked with specific virus. The reproducibility panel consisted of high
positive (n=2), low negative (n=2),and low positive (n=3) and high
negative specimens (n=3). The latter were prepared near the assay limit of
sensitivity. Eachsample was evaluated twice per day for three
consecutive days by three different laboratories.

ii. Reproducibility was 100%with no intra-assay and inter-assay variability
for samples prepared above or below the limit of analytical sensitivity.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Not applicable.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity of this assay was established in tests with
dilutions of RSV strains VR-26 (RSV A), VR-1302 (RSV A), VR-1540
(RSV A), VR-955 (RSV B), VR-1400 (RSV B) and VR-1401 (RSV B).
The lower limit of detection is dependent on factors such as the cell
culture lines used, the number of passages performed and the efficiencies
of the isolation methods. For this reason, assay limit of detection levels
may vary if other strains or samples are tested.

3. Clinical studies:
a. b. Clinical Sensitivity and specificity
Clinical studies were performed during the 2006-07 season to evaluate the
performance of TRU RSV against tissue culture in the laboratory setting.
Four independent laboratories (in three different geographic regions of the
US) and the manufacturer’s laboratory tested a total of 625 samples submitted
