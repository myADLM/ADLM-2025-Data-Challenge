510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
K071128
B. Purpose for Submission:
Marketing product in the U.S.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Aperio Technologies, Inc.
ScanScope® XT System, IHC HER2/neu Image Analysis Application
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Computer-assisted image analyzer for immunohistochemistry Her2/neu slides
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The ScanScope® XT System is an automated digital slide creation, management,
viewing and analysis system which consists of an automated digital microscope
slide scanner, computer, color monitor, keyboard and digital pathology
information management software and image analysis software. The image
analysis software assists the pathologist in quantitative assessment of
immunohistochemistry stained histological specimens. The system software
makes no independent interpretations of the data.
2. Principles of Operation:
The ScanScope® XT System is intended to provide quantitative input to the
pathologist to supplement the qualitative interpretation of immunohistochemistry
Her2/neu stained breast cancer specimens. Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded
breast cancer specimens are stained with the Dako Hercep Test™ according to the
package insert. Slides are then scanned and digitized at high resolution using the
ScanScope XT digital slide scanner. The pathologist then outlines tumor cell only
regions and runs the image analysis algorithm. Between 15 and 20 regions and a
minimum of 1000 tumor cells should be analyzed to maximize analysis results.

The IHC Membrane Image Analysis algorithm detects the membrane staining for
the individual tumor cells in the selected regions and quantifies the intensity and
completeness of the membrane staining. Tumor cells are individually classified
as 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+ based on their membrane staining intensity and completeness.
The HER2 score is then calculated based on the percentages of 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+
cells according to the HER2 scoring scheme. A markup image highlights the
detected cell features (black = nuclei and membrane) and the membrane staining
which is color-coded according to the cell classification (blue =0, yellow = 1+,
orange = 2+, red = 3+). The pathologist is then provided with HER2 score and
the percentages of 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+ cells.
The pathologist makes a final call based on both the qualitative and quantitative
information and should follow all appropriate instructions in the Dako Hercep
Test™ product insert.
3. Modes of Operation:
Semi-automated computer-assisted interpretation.
4. Specimen Identification:
Specimens are identified by slide label (a digital image is taken of the slide label
and stored with the digital slide) or by barcode, if provided by the user’s
laboratory information system.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Immunohistochemical stained microslides can be loaded in the ScanScope XT
manually (one at a time) or automatically. The ScanScope XT can automatically
scan 120 slides contained in slide racks.
6. Calibration:
Calibration of the ScanScope XT is an automated process which is re-verified as
part of the scanning process for every scanned slide. If the calibration is not
within predefined limits, then the user is prevented from scanning the slide and
must take steps to assure that the scan is within acceptable limits.
When the user scans a slide, the controller software automatically performs a
“prescan”. The prescan is a scan of a small region of the slide which contains
clear glass or “white space”. The brightness and color characteristics of the image
are used to correct the resulting scanned image. The main functions of the
prescan process are to automatically verify that no significant tissue is present,
flatten the illumination field, correct the white balance, and measure bulb
brightness.

HER2/neu (c-erbB-2) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal and neoplastic tissue.
When used with the Dako HercepTest™, it is indicated for use as an aid in the
assessment of breast cancer patients for whom HERCEPTIN® (Trastuzumab) treatment
is being considered. Note: The IHC HER2 Image Analysis application is an adjunctive
computer-assisted methodology to assist the reproducibility of a qualified pathologist in
the acquisition and measurement of images from microscope slides of breast cancer
specimens stained for the presence of HER-2 receptor protein. The accuracy of the test
result depends upon the quality of the immunohistochemical staining. It is the
responsibility of a qualified pathologist to employ appropriate morphological studies and
controls as specified in the instructions for the Dako HercepTest™ to assure the validity
of the IHC HER2 Image Analysis application assisted HER-2/neu score. The actual
correlation of the Dako HercepTest™ to Herceptin® clinical outcome has not been
established.

J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy (Comparison to Manual Method):
The substantial equivalence study was based on comparison of image analysis to
conventional manual microscopy.
A multi-site study was conducted at two clinical sites to compare the performance of
Aperio’s IHC HER2 Image Analysis to manual microscopy. 180 formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded breast tissue specimens immunohistochemically stained using Dako’s
HerceptTest™were used for this study; 80 specimens with approximately equal HER2
score distribution from site 1, and 100 routine specimens from site 2. At each site, three
pathologists performed a blinded read of the glass slides using a microscope and reported
the HER2 score for each of the slides. The glass slides were scanned at Aperio using a
different ScanScope for each site, and after a wash-out period of over one week and
randomization of the slides, the same three pathologists remotely viewed and outlined a
representative set of tumor regions to be analyzed by the IHC HER2 image analysis. The
pathologists received feedback on the way they outlined tumor regions for their first 3 to
7 slides before the slides were analyzed. The algorithm itself was run in batch mode
blinded from the pathologists to avoid any influence of the pathologists in their choice of
the tumor regions. The algorithm was used “out of the box”. The algorithm reported the
HER2 score for each of the three pathologists for each of the slides.

The statistical analyses are presented across all slides for each of the methods: manual
microscopy and image analysis, and comparatively between methods for manual
microscopy against image analysis.
Statistical analyses are provided for a trichotomous categorization of the HER2 scores
combining 0 and 1+ and leaving 2+ and 3+ uncombined. Percentage Agreement (PA)
along with an exact 95% Confidence Interval (CI) are presented overall for all
trichotomous HER2 score categories combined and for each of the trichotomous HER2
score categories separately using a dichotomous outcome of that category vs. the two
other categories.

The inter-pathologists agreements for the performed (blinded) image analysis (PA: 86.3-
93.8%) were comparable to the inter-pathologists agreements for manual microscopy
(PA: 76.3-91.3%). The agreements between the pathologists’ manual microscopy and
performed (blinded) image analysis (PA: 77.5-92.5%) were comparable to the
interpathologists agreements for manual microscopy (PA: 76.3-91.3%).
b. Precision:
Eight HER2 slides with two slides per HER2 score 0, 1+, 2+ and 3+were sampled from
one of the clinical sites to be used in a suite of precision studies. The slides were sampled
in sequential order using the rounded average score of the manual microscopy scores
provided by the three pathologists.
Separate studies were conducted to analyze the system introduced variability separately
from the variability introduced by the pathologists outlining the tumor regions for the

analysis. System precision studies used the same tumor regions for analysis over all runs
to eliminate the influence by the pathologists. Pathologist precision studies used the same
digital slides to outline tumor regions and run the analysis to eliminate the influence of
the system. The precision studies analyzed the changes in the system response by
extending the analysis of the coarse HER2 score to the underlying cumulative
percentages of 3+, 2+ and 1+ cells on which the HER2 score calculations are based.
Intra-Run/Intra-System
The eight HER2 slides were scanned 10 times on the same ScanScope system. The image
analysis results show perfect agreement (100%) for the calculated HER2 scores and an
overall average standard deviation of 0.69% (maximum 2.46%) and average range
(maximum – minimum) of 1.22% (maximum 7.14%) for the cumulative percentages of
3+, 2+ and 1+ cells (range from 0.0 to 100.0%) across all runs.
Inter-Run/Intra-System
The eight HER2 slides were scanned on the same ScanScope system over 20 times on
different days. The image analysis results show perfect agreement (100%) for the
calculated HER2 scores and an overall average standard deviation of 0.67% (maximum
2.43%) and average range of 1.68% (maximum 12.07%) for the cumulative percentages
of 3+, 2+ and 1+ cells across all runs.
Inter-System
The same eight HER2 slides were scanned 10 times on three different ScanScope
systems. The image analysis results show perfect agreement (100%) for the calculated
HER2 scores across all systems and all runs. The image analysis results on each of the
three ScanScope systems show an overall average standard deviation of 0.69%, 0.73%
and 0.70% (maximum 2.46%, 1.65%, 1.34%) and average range of 1.22%, 1,28% and
1,28% (maximum 7.14%, 5.09%, 4.70%) for the cumulative percentages of 3+, 2+ and
1+ cells respectively over all runs. The image analysis results of the three ScanScope
systems combined show an overall average standard deviation of 0.78% (maximum
2.41%) and average range of 1.93% (maximum 8.95%) for the cumulative percentages of
3+, 2+ and 1+ cells respectively over all runs.
Intra-Pathologist
One pathologist outlined the tumor regions for analysis on the same eight HER2 slides 5
times. The image analysis results show 4 cases out of 40 (10%) where the HER2 scores
differed from the median HER2 score and an overall average standard deviation of 2.44%
(maximum 8.08%) and average range of 3.51% (maximum 18.61%) for the cumulative
percentages of 3+, 2+ and 1+ cells.
Inter-Pathologists
Three pathologists outlined the tumor regions for analysis on the same eight HER2 slides
as part of the clinical comparison to manual microscopy study. The image analysis results
show 4 cases out of 24 (17%) where the HER2 scores differed from the median HER2
score and an overall average standard deviation of 9.77% (maximum 27.09%) and
average range of 11.20% (maximum 48.26%) for the cumulative percentages of 3+, 2+
and 1+ cells (range from 0.0 to 100.0%).
