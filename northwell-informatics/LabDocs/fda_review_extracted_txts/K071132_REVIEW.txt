L. Test Principle:
The Tosoh G8 Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer HLC–723G8 uses a cation exchange
column and separates the usual hemoglobin components in the blood into six fractions, A1a,
A1b, F, L-A1c, SA1c and A0. The separation is done by eluting the hemoglobins from the
column with a gradient of three elution buffers containing different salt concentrations.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision was evaluated at two sites, one instrument per site. Each site
was provided with the same sample set. The first study consisted of two levels of
controls and three patient whole blood samples in the normal, high and very high
%HbA1c range. Patient samples are EDTA human whole blood. The estimates of
imprecision obtained from the analysis are given in the table below.
Samples Number of Mean(%HbA1c) SD %CV

Whole Blood High 20 7.39 0.03 0.42
Whole Blood Very 20 13.54 0.06 0.44

The second study consisted of diluted whole blood samples at low, high and very
high %HbA1c values. The estimates of imprecision obtained from the analysis are
given in the table below.
Samples Number of Mean(%HbA1c) SD %CV

Between-run precision was evaluated on five samples and two controls at two sites,
one instrument per site. In the first study two controls and three whole blood
samples, representing both normal and abnormal levels of %HbA1c were analyzed
on 20 non-consecutive days. Each site was provided with the same sample set and
directed to perform one sample per day on one instrument. The estimates of
imprecision obtained from the analysis are given in the table below.

The second study at a different site consisted of diluted whole blood patient samples
at low, and high %HbA1c values analyzed on 20 non-consecutive days. The
estimates of imprecision obtained from the analysis are given in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the reportable range was performed using whole blood samples
collected in EDTA with low (2.2%) HbA1c and high (16.9%) HbA1c levels. The
observed values of the neat specimens were verified by HPLC. The theoretical value
was calculated based upon mixing two samples at differing ratios and dividing by
the dilution factor. The diluted samples were run in triplicate on the G8 Analyzer.
The observed values were all within 100 ± 5% of the theoretical values. The results
of the study are below.
Sample Pool Observed %A1c Theoretical % A1c % Recovery
0 2.2
1 3.6 3.6 100
2 5.1 5.1 100
3 6.6 6.6 100
4 8.0 8.1 98.8

8 14.0 14.0 100
9 15.5 15.5 100
10 16.9 16.9 100
A second linearity study was performed using four levels of commercially available
linearity material tested in triplicate. The assigned values were compared to the
mean of the observed values. The observed values were within ± 5% of the expected
values for all samples tested. The results submitted demonstrated linearity across the
claimed reportable range of 4.0 to 16.9 % A1c.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Hemoglobin A1c reference materials were obtained from the Reference Material
Institute for Clinical Chemistry Standards, Japan. The reference materials and
calibrators were run on multiple G8 analyzers and other predicate Tosoh analyzers to
assign Japanese Diabetic Society (JDS) A1c values to the calibrators. The JDS
values are aligned to IFCC A1c values and NGSP A1c values according to an IFCC-
JDS publication and the IFCC-NGSP Master Equation.
Real time stability and accelerated stability study protocols and acceptance criteria
were reviewed and found to be acceptable to support stability of the Calibrators for
two years at 2-8˚C.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 4.0 to 16.9 % HbA1c. See the linearity study above for data
on recovery of samples across the measuring range.
e. Analytical specificity:
Several interfering substance studies were performed which included Labile A1c,
carbamylated A1c, icterus, lipemia, acetaldehyde, acetylsalicylic acid and EDTA.
Whole blood pooled samples with normal and diabetic levels of HbA1c were initially
analyzed without the spiked material. Then each sample was spiked with glucose,
bilirubin, triglycerides, sodium cyanate, acetylsalicylic acid, acetaldehyde and EDTA to
determine interference. The specification for interference was variance in the HbA1c
value greater than the assigned value x 1.00 ± 0.05. No interference was seen from labile
A1c up to 1000 mg/dL, icterus up to 20 mg/dL, lipemia up to 1000 mg/dL, carbamylated
A1c up to 25 mg/dL, acetaldehyde up to 25 mg/dL, acetylsalicylic acid up to 50 mg/dL
and EDTA up to 10 mg/dL.
A hemoglobin (Hb) variant interference study was performed using a high HbF human
whole blood sample and commercially available controls for HbAE, HbAD, HbAS and
HbAc. Two pooled whole blood patient samples representing normal and abnormal
HbA1c levels were used. A dilution series of each variant Hb was prepared with the
patient samples and measured on the Tosoh G8 Analyzer. The acceptance criteria were
that a variant Hb is considered to interfere with the G8 Analyzer when the variance
percent (%) or recovery percent (%) is greater than 100 ±10%. The results of this study
show that HbAE was not distinguished from the other peaks and therefore does interfere
with sA1c measurement. No interference was observed for HbF up to a concentration of
10%. No interference was observed for HbAD, HbAS and HbAC up to a concentration
of 30%. Hemoglobins AD, AS, and AC elute after the A0 peak and are subtracted when
calculating sA1c.

Not applicable.
