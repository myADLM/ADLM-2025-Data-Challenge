(conjugate). The sample/conjugate mixture is cycled in and out of the SPR several times.
The antigen binds with the immunoglobulins to form a sandwich. Washing steps eliminate
unbound compounds. Two detection steps are then performed successively. During each
step, the substrate is cycled in and out of the SPR. The conjugate enzyme catalyzes the
hydrolysis of this substrate into a fluorescent product, the fluorescence of which is measured
at 450nm. The intensity of the fluorescence is proportional to the concentration of antigen
present in the sample. Results are automatically calculated by the instrument in relation to
two calibration curves corresponding to the two detection steps. A fluorescence threshold
value determines the calibration curve to be used for each sample
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Six serum samples were tested in duplicate in 20 different runs (2 runs per day) with
2 reagent lots using the same instrument at 3 sites. The repeatability (intra-run
precision), inter- run reproducibility (inter-run precision), inter-site reproducibility
(inter-site precision) and inter-lot reproducibility (total precision = intra-run, inter-
run, inter-day, inter-site, inter-lot) were calculated based on recommendations from
CLSI EP 5-A2 document. Total precision ranged from 6.17 – 15.31%CV; intra-run
precision from 1.93 – 4.61% CV; inter-run precision from 3.57 – 7.04% CV and inter
–site precision from 4.21 – 11.40%CV.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A dilution study was performed on 2 verification lots to validate the dilution claimed
in the package insert. With the diluent provided in the VIDAS BRAHMS PCT kit,
dilutions up to 1/20 are acceptable. Recovery percentages up to 1/20 are within the
acceptable range of 80 to 120%. On the studied range [0.11-229ng/ml], a PCT
negative sample can be used as a diluent for samples.
A second linearity study was also performed as per CLSI EP 6-A. Evaluation of the
linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures, Vol. 23, No. 16. Two verification
lots were used and high and low PCT level samples were diluted in various
proportions to obtain nine dilutions (1/10 to 9/10). Each sample and each dilution
were tested once in 3 separate runs. The assay was linear over the studied range [0.07
- 218 ng/ml]
No Hook Effect was found up to procalcitonin concentrations of 2,600 ng/ml
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Studies were performed to test kit stability; calibrator and control stability as well as
specimen stability (serum and plasma tubes).
4

--- Page 5 ---
Kit stability results provided were within the expected ranges for up to 9 months for 2
verification lots at 2-8°C. Testing is on going to obtain 12 month stability data.
Stability studies were also conducted using calibrators and controls. Study results
show that after reconstitution, calibrators and controls are stable at 11 months of
storage at -25+ 6°C. At 2-8°C calibrators and controls are stable at 2 months of
storage. At 18-25 °C, calibrators and controls are stable at 2 weeks of storage and are
also stable after 6 freeze/thaw cycles.
For the different sampling tubes (serum and plasma) stability studies were performed
to determine the storage conditions at various temperatures, storage times and after
multiple freezing/thawing cycles. At 2-8°C, storage at 2 and 3 days did not impact the
results. Results were also acceptable for storage at 7 months at -25 + 6°C and for 2
months at less than -60°C. Samples were also stable after 4 freeze/thaw cycles.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical detection limit is stated as <0.05ng/ml. Recombinant human PCT was
diluted at various concentrations in a pool of human serum. 2 verification lots were
tested. The analytical detection limit was defined as the lowest concentration of PCT
that can be distinguished from standard zero. The limit for Lot 1 was 0.012 ng/ml and
for Lot 2 was 0.011 ng/ml
e. Analytical specificity:
No significant interference was noted with bilirubin at 574µmol/l, hemoglobin at 347
µmol/l and triglycerides at 30g/l.
No significant interference was noted with protein(albumin) at 4g/dl, human
calcitonin at 60 ng/ml, human katacalcin at 10 ng/ml, human alpha-CGRP at 10µg/ml
and human beta-CGRP at 10µg/ml.
No significant interference was noted with imipenem at 0.5mg/ml, cefotaxime at 180
mg/dl, vancomycin at 3 mg/ml, dopamine at 26mg/dl, noradrenalin at 4µg/ml,
dobutamine at 22.4 µg/ml, heparin at 16,000U/L and furosemide at 4mg/dl.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut offs are:
(a) >2 ng/ml = high risk of severe sepsis and/or septic shock
(b) <0.5 ng/ml = low risk of severe sepsis and septic shock

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A comparison study was performed between the VIDAS BRAHMS PCT and the
BRAHMS PCT LIA using 204 samples. The percentages of concordance between the
two assays at cut offs 0.5 ng/ml and 2 ng/ml are 97.1% and 94.1%

Total 117 87 204
b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was performed using serum and plasma samples. Serum
reference tube, serum with gel or silica, heparin plasma and EDTA plasma tubes were
used. Thirty two blood donors were tested using each tube type and each sampling
tube was spiked with PCT. No significant difference was noted between the PCT
concentrations of the serum samples or plasma samples except for the EDTA tubes. A
decrease of PCT concentration was detected with plasma samples from EDTA tubes.
A limitation statement to this effect is included in the package insert.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Clinical studies were conducted on 232 patients on their first day of admission to the
ICU. Patients admitted for trauma, surgery, burns or prolonged or severe cardiogenic
shock were excluded. Patients were classified into 5 categories based on the
ACCP/SCCM consensus criteria namely no infection, SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis and
septic shock. There were 143 males and 89 females with age ranges from 18 to 92
yrs. Results at both cut offs were as follows:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
N/A
4. Clinical cut-off:
A total of 204 samples from patients admitted to the ICU were tested on both the VIDAS
BRAHMS PCT and the BRAHMS PCT LIA. Concordance between both methods at the
cut off of 0.5 and 2.0 ng/ml was excellent. The Passing & Bablok slopes showed some
variability but the total concordance at the relevant clinical cut-offs was good.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
In agreement with the literature, results obtained with the VIDAS PCT kit during a study
performed on patients admitted to ICU showed that:
<0.5 ng/ml represents a low risk of severe sepsis and/or septic shock
>2 ng/ml represents a high risk of severe sepsis and/or septic shock
Concentrations <0.5 ng/ml do not exclude an infection or a systemic infection in its initial
stages. Increased procalcitonin can occur without infection. PCT concentrations between
0.5 and 2.0 ng/ml can be interpreted taking into account the patient’s history

O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The VIDAS PC instrument cleared in 1989 under K891385 is attached to a computer and
a printer. Each instrument has 5 independent sections allowing 5 different assays to be
run simultaneously. Each section can process up to six samples. When fully loaded the
device can process up to 30 samples. The miniVIDAS is a smaller compact version of
the VIDAS PC and was cleared under K923579 in 1993. It has a built in computer,
keyboard and printer and is used most frequently in physician’s office laboratories. Two
independent sections each accept six tests so twelve samples can be processed
simultaneously. The VIDAS assay can be run on either instrument.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ________ or No X
3. Specimen Identification:
All assay steps are controlled automatically by the instrument. The sample is transferred
into the wells. The PCT strip consists of ten wells covered with labeled foil seal. The
label comprises a bar code which indicates the assay code (PCT), kit lot number and
expiration date.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The solid phase receptor (SPR) serves as both the solid phase and the pipetting device.
The foil of the 1st well is perforated to allow introduction of the sample into well 1. The
last well (well 10) of each strip is a cuvette in which the fluorometric reading is
performed. The center wells of the strip contain the various reagents required for the
assay
5. Calibration:
The kit contains 2 PCT controls and 2 PCT calibrators See Sec. I and M 1(c).
6. Quality Control:
The Master curve is established at time of manufacture for each lot of reagents. It is
provided with each test kit and is entered into the VIDAS instrument using the Master
Lot Entry card (MLE) included in the kit. Data from the MLE card is entered once for
each lot of reagents. Each lab establishes its own calibration curve (recalibration) based
on the mathematical master curve data and the test results of two calibrators tested in
8

duplicate by the lab. Recalibration serves to control for minor variations in assay signal
from one VIDAS instrument to another and is therefore specific for each instrument.
