5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the
device and its components, and the results of the analysis
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities required,
including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied
c) A declaration of conformity with design controls. The declaration of conformity should include:
i) A statement signed by the individual responsible, that, as required by the risk analysis, all
verification and validation activities were performed by the designated individual(s) and the
results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance criteria were met, and
ii) A statement signed by the individual responsible, that the manufacturing facility is in
conformance with design control procedure requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and
the records are available for review.
The design control activities performed
a. Assay Sensitivity
Target 1, FLOW Cp 34.87 vs. QFLOWdna Cp 31.46
Target 2, FLOW Cp 34.68 vs. QFLOWdna Cp 31.76
The Cp values obtained for the QFLOWdna processed sample set were earlier than
that obtained for the FLOW processed sample set.
b. Quantity of DNA (Spectrophotometric method)
FLOW 6.18 ng/ µL vs. QFLOWdna 54.61 ng/ µL
The quantity of total DNA is higher for sample processed using the QFLOWdna
protocol.
c. OD260/OD280 ratio
FLOW 1.02 vs. QFLOWdna 1.96
The purity of DNA with regard to protein content is better for the QFLOWdna
processed samples.
d. Gel Analysis of Purified DNA
The bands of the DNA purified using the QFLOWdna procedure were brighter,
indicating the quantity of DNA is higher.
e. Removal of Inhibitory Substances
Citrated whole blood samples from 16 normal healthy donors were processed using
the FLOW and the QFLOWdna procedures and then tested using the Target 1 and

There was adequate removal of PCR inhibitors from whole blood samples processed
using the QFLOWdna protocol.
f. Carry-Over
Strongly positive samples (spiked at 5x 106 CFU/mL) were purified, using FLOW and
the QFLOWdna procedures, next to negative (unspiked ) samples. Both sets of
negative samples were tested by the Target 1 and Target 2 assays.
Target 1, FLOW carry-over rate 0% (0/42) vs. QFLOWdna 2.4% (1/42)
Target 2, FLOW carry-over rate 0% (0/42) vs. QFLOWdna 0% (0/42)
6. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary or Statement and the Indications for
Use Enclosure (and Class III Summary for Class III devices).
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the
indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the
submitter’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between
the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has
not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New
510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially
equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.

1. Intended Use:
The JBAIDS Anthrax Detection System is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test
system intended for the qualitative in vitro diagnostic (IVD) detection of target DNA sequences on
the pXO1 plasmid (Target 1) and the pXO2 plasmid (Target 2) from Bacillus anthracis. The
system can be used to test human whole blood collected in sodium citrate from individuals
suspected of having anthrax, positive blood cultures, and cultured organisms grown on blood agar
plates. The JBAIDS Anthrax Target 2 assay is used as a supplementary test only after a positive
result with the Target 1 Assay.
JBAIDS Anthrax Target 1 and Target 2 Assays are run on the JBAIDS instrument using the
Diagnostic Wizard.
2. Device Description: Provide a statement of how the device is either similar to and/or
different from other marketed devices, plus data (if necessary) to support the statement.
Does the device design use software? Is the device sterile? Is the device for single use? Is
the device over-the-counter or prescription use? Does the device contain drug or biological
product as a component? Is this device a kit? Provide a summary about the devices
design, materials, physical properties and toxicology profile if important.
The Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) Anthrax Detection
System is a fully integrated in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) system composed of the JBAIDS instrument
with laptop computer, software, 2 different freeze-dried reagent assays (in one kit) for the qualitative
detection of pathogenic Bacillus anthracis, and 4 different sample preparation protocols, two for
isolating target DNA from whole blood, one for processing blood culture, and another for
processing colonies. This submission is for a modification to the sample purification kit described
below.
Device Modification
The modification consists in the addition of the QFLOWdna Sample Purification Kit for the
purification of whole blood samples. The QFLOWdna protocol offers the advantages of
requiring a smaller sample volume, and all processing steps can be performed using a
smaller bench top centrifuge. The table below exhibits a summary of changes to the
modified kit.
