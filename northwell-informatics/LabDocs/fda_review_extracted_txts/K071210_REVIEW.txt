L. Test Principle:
FIDIS™ CONNECTIVE 10* is based on the use of distinct uniform size color-
coded microspheres and a benchtop flow cytometer interfaced to a digital signal
processing hardware and software. A red diode laser beam of the flow cytometer
classifies each set of microspheres on the basis of its unique fluorescence intensity
(red to orange) which allows to identify which analyte is being tested. At the same
time, a green laser beam illuminates the external second molecule fluorescence to
quantify the specific reaction related to each analyte.
Each antigen required for the assay is covalently coupled to an individual set of
microspheres through its surface functional groups. The different antigen-coupled
microspheres are mixed together to constitute the final microsphere reagent.
FIDIS™ CONNECTIVE 10* allows the detection of 10 autoantibody specificities:
double stranded DNA (dsDNA), SSA 60kDa, SSA 52kDa, SSB, Sm, Sm/RNP,
Scl70, Jo-1, Ribosomes and Centromeres. The microspheres are classified on the
basis of their unique fluorescence intensity ratio that allows the identity of analyte
being tested. Each dot in a white plot corresponds to an individual microsphere.
Seventy (70) µL of each sample are needed for each analysis. FIDIS™ Connective 10*
assay was optimized by flow cytometry for the average binding capacity at the given
dilution (1:200) from the median fluorescence value using 200 microspheres per parameter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To evaluate intra-assay and inter assay reproducibility, four samples covering the
reportable range of the assay were analyzed on the modified FIDIS™ Connective
10*. For within-run, the four samples were assayed 6 times in one run and for
between-run; the four samples were assayed 2 times per run for 6 runs. Additional
study was performed for dsDNA on the low end of the measuring range. Results

b. Matrix comparison:
Serum is the only recommended matrix.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not provided
b. Clinical specificity:
Not provided
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The reported expected ranges were estimated from 2 populations:
• 50 samples from blood donors
• 48 samples selected from their potential biological interferences and according to
WHO standard for dsDNA specificity
Arbitrary units (AU/mL) <30 30-40 >40
AU/mL AU/mL AU/mL
International units (IU/mL) <30 30-40 >40
For dsDNA IU/mL IU/mL IU/mL
Interpretation Negative Equivocal1 Positive
The negative thresholds (30 AU/mL or 30 IU/mL) correspond to the 97.9th percentile
for dsDNA, SSA, Sm/RNP; 99.0% for centromere and ribosome, and 100% for SSB,
Sm, Scl70 and Jo1 for the populations studied.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
