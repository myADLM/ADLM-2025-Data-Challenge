K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI EP5-A – Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement
Methods
L. Test Principle:
The aspartate aminotransferase (ASTL) assay uses enzymatic activation. AST in a
sample catalyzed the transfer of an amino group between L-aspartate and 2-
oxoglutarate to form oxaloazcetate and L-glutamate. The oxaloacetate then reacts
with NADH, in the presence of malate dehydrogenase (MDH), to form NAD+.
Pyridoxal phosphate serves as a coenzyme in the amino transfer reaction. The rate of
the NADH oxidation is directly proportional to the catalytic AST activity. It is
determined by measuring the decrease in absorbance.
The glucose hexokinase (GLUC2) assay is a UV test with enzymatic reference
method that utilizes hexokinase. The hexokinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of
glucose to glucose-6-phosphate by ATP. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
oxidizes glucose-6-phosphate in the presence of NAHP to gluconate-6-phosphate.
The rate of NADPH formation during the reaction is directly proportional to the
glucose concentration and is measured photometrically.
The C-reactive protein (latex) (CRPLX) is a particle enhanced turbidimetric assay.
Human CRP agglutinates with latex particles coated with monoclonal anti-CRP
antibodies. The precipitate is determined turbidimetrically.
The sodium, potassium and chloride ion-selective electrode (ISE) have a selective
membrane in contact with both the test solution and an internal filling solution. The
internal filling solution contains the test ion at a fixed concentration. The membrane
EMF is determined by difference in concentration of the test ion in the test solution
and the internal filling solution. The EMF develops according to the Nerst equation
for a specific ion in solution. The complete measurement system for a particular ion
includes the ISE, a reference electrode and electronic circuits to measure and process
the EMF to give the test ion concentration. The sodium and potassium electrodes are
based on neutral carriers and the chloride electrode is based on an ion exchanger.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision studies were conducted in three physician office
laboratories (POL) using trained medical technicians to test for potential
systematic and random error. Two controls materials and two sample pools
(prepared daily) were run in triplicates for 9 to 15 days (site-dependant) at two
7

--- Page 8 ---
US sites and one European site.
The sponsor also conducted an imprecision study according to modified CLSI
EP5-A. Two controls and two human serum pools (normal and evaluated)
were run in triplicate for twenty-one days in one US and one foreign site. The
second US site conducted the study with the two controls and two human
serum pools in triplicate twice a day for ten days.
The combined results from all three POL sites and materials are shown in the
