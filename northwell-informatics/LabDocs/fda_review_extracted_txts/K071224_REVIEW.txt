L. Test Principle:
The Dimension Vista Vitamin B12 and Folate Flex assays are homogeneous,
competitive chemiluminescent immunoassays based on LOCI technology. The LOCI
reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and binding proteins. The first bead
reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a B12 derivative for the B12 assay and folic acid
derivative for the Folate assay and a chemiluminescent dye. The second bead reagent
(Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitizer dye. Samples
undergo a pretreatment step. After the sample pretreatment, the binding protein and
Chemibeads is added to the sample an incubated. Sensibeads are added and bind to
the biotin to form bead-pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at
680nm generates singlet oxygen from the Sensibeads which diffuses to the
Chemibeads and triggers a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting
chemiluminescent signal is measured at 612nm and is an inverse function of the
concentration the analyte in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability testing was done in accordance with CLSI Approved Guideline
for Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Devices: EP5-A2.
Specimens at each level were analyzed in duplicate, twice a day, for 20 days.
The repeatability and within-lab standard deviations (SD) and percent
coefficient of variation (%CV) were calculated by the analysis of variance
method. The data are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range of 50-2000 pg/mL for B12 and 0.5-20 ng/mL for Folate
is based on linearity, detection limit and method comparison.
Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by testing serum samples with
high concentrations of B12 and Folate. These samples were serially diluted
with the zero calibrator down to the lower measuring range (2183 to 0 pg/mL
B12 and 24.4 to 0 Folate) in 9 points. Each dilution was tested in replicates of
five.
The linear regression was calculated.
Slope Intercept Correlation Coefficient
B12 0.988 5.8 0.998
FOL 0.99 0.23 0.994
Recovery
B12
Two serum samples and one plasma sample with baseline values of B12
ranging from 217-276 were spiked with known amounts of USP B12 and
samples were assayed. The percent recovery was calculated. The mean
recovery was 96.5%.

Plasma 4.4 11.5 8.0 7.9 98.8
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Anchor pools are made by adding varying known quantities of the United
States Pharmacopoeia (USP) grade B12 and Folate into a B12/Folate depleted
human serum matrix. The concentrations are verified by testing patient
samples with values across the range of the assay.
Standard values are assigned to a master calibrator lot using USP grade B12
and Folate into a bovine serum albumin matrix. Values are then assigned to
the commercial calibrator (bovine serum albumin matrix at target
concentration) verses master calibrator using instruments calibrated with the
master pool. Each level is tested on mulitple instruments for a total of >40
measurements.
Un-open calibrators stored frozen at -20 to -10º C are stable until the stated
expiration date. Real time calibrator stability is ongoing. Un-open thawed
calibrators stored at 2 to 8º C are stable for 30 days. Open vial punctured
stability was set at 3 days.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of the Blank represents the lowest concentration of analyte that can
be distinguished from zero and defined as the mean value (n=20 replicates)
plus two standard deviations of a zero level sample. The Limit of Blank for
Dimension Vista® Vitamin B12 assay and Dimension Vista® Folate assay
were determined to be 20 pg/mL and 0.5 ng/mL respectively.
