L. Test Principle:
Polystyrene particles coated with an immunocomplex consisting of human
immunoglobulin and anti-human IgG from sheep are aggregated when mixed with
samples containing RF. These aggregates scatter a beam of light passed through the
sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the
protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of
known concentration.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was performed on a BN II System in accordance with CLSI
EP5-A2. Specimens at each level were analyzed in duplicate, twice a day, for
20 days. The repeatability, between-run and within-lab %CVs were
calculated by the analysis of variance method.
Sample Mean Repeatability Between Run Within
IU/mL %CV %CV Lab %CV
Control SL/1 69.3 2.2 5.2 5.7
Control SL/2 170.2 2.2 3.1 3.8
Serum pool low 1 27.9 2.7 5.4 7.9
Serum pool low 2 81.3 2.2 4.8 5.3
Serum pool high 1 582.7 5.1 4.8 7.7
Serum pool high 2 600.8 5.3 5.8 8.1
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the assay range (approximately 10 to 640 IU/mL) was
confirmed by testing an internal, high standard. The standard was serially
diluted with System Diluent down to the lower measuring range (693.2 down
to 10.8 IU/mL) on a BN II Analyzer. Each dilution was tested in replicates of
three. Data were analyzed using linear regression analysis. The slope was
1.021, intercept 0.665 and r = 1.00.
Hook Effect: The possibility of hook effect occurring was evaluated with a

serum sample above the assay range. The sample was serially diluted and
analyzed on the BN II analyzer and demonstrated no hook effect up to 3967
IU/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrator is standardized against the N Rheumatology Standard SL and
1st British Standard 64/0023.
d. Detection Limit/Analytical Sensitivity:
The analytical sensitivity of the assay was determined by the lower limit of
the reference curve (approximately 10 IU/mL).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed according to CLSI EP7-A2 to determine
the effect of bilirubin (0.6 g/L) and hemoglobin (10/g/L). Testing was
conducted by running a serum sample without the interferant and comparing it
to the value obtained from the same sample to which the potential interferant
had been added. For each spiked sample, the % recovery was determined.
Percent recoveries ranged from 92.3 to 100.7% in the bilirubin spiked samples
and from 89.7 to 95.6% for hemoglobin
f. Assay cut-off:
Testing of serum from 253 adult European blood donors resulted in a 97.5th
percentile of 15.9 IU/mL.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Serum samples from 90 subjects were tested on the BN II analyzer.

c. Behring ProSpec analyzer (k001647) compared to the BN II analyzer
The Performance Study Protocol included method comparison and precision.
Between run %CVs ranged from 1.1 to 5.3% and within lab ranged from 2.2
to 6.3%. The linearity studies showed a slope of 0.98 and r = 1.0. The two
instruments were compared by testing 86 samples ranging from 18.7 to 510.3
IU/mL. The comparison showed the following: y = 1.1 – 13.4, r = 0.99.
Established acceptance criteria were met.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not determined
b. Clinical specificity:
Not determined
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not determined
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected value in the normal population is negative. However, apparently
healthy asymptomatic individuals may have RF, usually of low titer. The
incidence of false positive increases with age and is similar in females and males.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
