3. Product code:
LCO
4. Panel:
81 Hematology
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The ZYMUTEST HIA IgGAM ELISA is a qualitative screening assay intended for the
global detection of heparin-dependent antibodies, whether the isotype is: IgG IgM, and
IgA, in human plasma, by clinical laboratories. It is intended for in vitro diagnostic use.
The ZYMUTEST HIA IgG ELISA is a qualitative assay intended for the detection of
heparin-dependent antibodies of the IgG isotope, in human plasma, by clinical
laboratories. It is intended for in vitro diagnostic use.
2. Indication(s) for use:
ZYMYUTEST HIA IgG AND IgGAM KITS are designed as a solid phase enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). These products are intended to be used as an
in vitro diagnostics kit by Hematology, coagulation or other pathology laboratories to
assist in screening patient samples for the presence of heparin-associated antibodies
commonly found in patients with heparin induced thrombocytopenia or thrombosis
(HIT).
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
4. Special instrument requirements:
I. Device Description:
The assay kit consists of a 96 welled micro ELISA plate coated with unfractionated
heparin, 3 vials each of lyophilized Positive and Negative controls, 3 vials
lyophilized Platelet lysate, 3 vials of Immunoconjugate, 25 mL of TMB substrate, 1
vial of sulfuric Acid Stop solution, buffer, diluents, and wash solution.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
L. Test Principle:
When a diluted plasma sample and platelet lysate is added to one of the microwells of the
coated plate, if present, heparin-dependent antibodies present in the sample will form
complexes with unfractionated heparin immobilized on the plate. Following a washing
step, bound antibodies are mixed with the immunoconjuuagate, which will bind to IgG,
IgM, and IgA isotypes. Following another washing step, the TMB peroxidase substrate is
added, and a blue color develops which turns yellow upon the addition of the stop

solution. The color that develops is directly proportional to the amount of heparin-
dependent antibodies present in the tested sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra-assay- ZYMUTEST HIA IgG and ZYMUTEST HIA IgGAM were
tested in duplicate using positive control material.
Positive control N Mean A450 CV%
Anti PF4-IgG Lot 061027D 6 1.31 3.07
Anti PF4-IgG Lot 061214A 9 1.10 4.46
Anti PF4-IgGAM Lot 061214D 9 1.74 4.75

Anti PF4-IgG Lot 061027D 7 1.34 7.11
Anti PF4-IgGAM Lot 061027G 7 1.84 7.50
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
n/a
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Negative controls are derived from normal human plasma with an A450 of
mean ± 2 SD.
The positive control is derived from chimeras made by coupling anti-PF4
polyclonal antibodies with human Igs (IgG, IgA or IGM, or the mixture of the
three), with an A450 of mean ± 5 SD.
d. Detection limit:
n/a
e. Analytical specificity: The effect of varying concentrations of heparin in the
assay was tested on 3 pathological plasmas with and without heparin addition,

ranging from 0 to 5 IU/ml. After heparin addition, plasma was diluted 1:100
and tested. Results demonstrated no heparin interference up to 1 IU/ml.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay was evaluated in hospital patients with no HIT, ACC patients with
circulating anticoagulant antibodies with no HIT, and normal healthy donors
with no autoimmunity background. Cut-off was established as mean + 3SD
for the normal hospital patients and ACC patients, which corresponded to + 5
SD for normal healthy donors.
