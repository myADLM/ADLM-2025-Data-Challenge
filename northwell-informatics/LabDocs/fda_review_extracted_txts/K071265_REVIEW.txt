H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The SmartCheck INR™ System is intended for quantitative testing of Prothrombin Time
in capillary blood. Results are given in International Normalize Ratio (INR) units.
The SmartCheck™ INR System is indicated for used by trained medical professionals in
a point of care setting for monitoring the INR of patients on oral anticoagulant therapy.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
None
4. Special instrument requirements:
None
I. Device Description:
The SmartCheck™ INR System consists of a hand held battery-powered meter with ROM
calibration chip, disposable, dual-chambered, test strips and high and low level external liquid
controls. When blood is applied to the strip it migrates by capillary action to the reaction
chambers of the strip. The reaction chamber contains a metallic disc and rabbit brain
thromboplastin reagent. When blood enters the reaction chamber a magnetic field is applied to
the strip to activate disc movement. Upon clot formation, the disc becomes immobilized and
clotting is optically detected. Clotting time is calculated and displayed as an INR result.

L. Test Principle:
Blood (or plasma control) is applied to the designated blood collection point on the test strip and
migrates by capillary action in dual channels along the length of the strip where each channel
ends in a reaction chamber. Each reaction chamber contains a metallic disc and rabbit brain
thromboplastin for initiation of the coagulation cascade leading to clot formation. Coagulation is
assessed by measuring the clotting time of blood or plasma via a physical system that detects
movement of the disc in each of the two chambers of the test strip, movement of the disc starts
when the blood reaches the reaction chamber.
The metallic disc is propelled from side-to-side in each chamber by magnetic fields. Disc
movement causes mixture of the blood and thromboplastin. Disc movement is monitored
optically. When blood enters each of the two chambers, a signal is sent to signify the beginning
of the test and the start of timing. As blood reacts with the clotting chemicals, disc movement is
impeded. When the disc stops moving the blood is deemed to have clotted and a signal is sent to
the meter software to signify the end of the test and end of timing.
The clotting time is measured as the average time taken from entry of the blood until the disc
stop moving. The measured PT value is translated to INR.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The total precision was calculated according to EP5-A2 Evaluation of Precision
Performance of Quantitative Methods. For each of the 5 days, 10 meters were used to
read strips from 2 different batches at 2 levels of control concentration (high and low)
For low control concentration
0.10077/0.962 X 100 = 10.5%
For high control concentration
0.61556/3.757 X 100 = 16.4%
The precision of the system was determined with whole blood samples from 280
patients on Coumadin spanning a wide INR range (as the system was designed) and a
precision of 8.7% CV was obtained.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
0.8 to 7.2 INR

Organization (WHO)

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Expected values for healthy normal individuals were assessed by the non-parametric
method per CLSI 28-A2 on 118 apparently healthy subjects not undergoing oral
anticoagulant therapy at three clinical sites (72 females aged 19-58years, 46 males 18-58
years). INR was measured on capillary blood using the SmartCheck INR System on three
lots of test strips. The results showed a normal range of 0.8-1.3 INR.
N. Instrument Name:
SmartCheck INR™ System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The SmartCheck™ INR System consists of a hand held battery-powered meter with
ROM calibration chip, disposable, dual-chambered, test strips and high and low level
external liquid controls. When blood is applied to the strip it migrates by capillary action
to the reaction chambers of the strip. The reaction chamber contains a metallic disc and
rabbit brain thromboplastin reagent. When blood enters the reaction chamber a magnetic
field is applied to the strip to activate disc movement. Upon clot formation, the disc
becomes immobilized and clotting is optically detected. Clotting time is calculated and
displayed as an INR result.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes _____X___ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
None
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
