1. Intended use(s):
The MicroScan® Synergies plus™ Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panels -
Tetracycline is intended for use in determining quantitative and/or qualitative
antimicrobial agent susceptibility and/or identification to the species level of
colonies, grown on solid media, of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative
anaerobic gram-positive Enterococci and Staphylococci. The MicroScan®
Synergies plus™ Panels are read on the WalkAway® -SI System (including
upgraded WalkAway® -40 or WalkAway® -96 to meet WalkAway® SI
equivalence).

It is indicated for use for the addition of Tetracycline at concentrations 0.25- 16
µg/mL (7-Dilution MIC Sequence), 0.5-8 µg/mL (5-Dilution BP Sequence), and
2-8 µg/mL (3-Dilution BP Sequence), to the gram-positive test panel for testing of
Enterococci spp. and Staphylococci spp. at 4.5- 16 hrs or 16-20 hours for an
overnight reading.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
• Turbidity method of inoculum preparation only.
• For prescription use only.
• Hold all susceptible (<8 µg/mL) Enterococcus faecium isolates to
overnight reporting (16/18 hours)
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:

--- Page 3 ---
Each panel contains two control wells: a negative control well, and a growth control
well (contains test medium without antibiotic). Antibiotics are diluted in water,
buffer, or minute concentrations of broth to selected concentrations prior to
dehydration of the panels. The panel is rehydrated and inoculated at the same time
with 0.1 ml of suspension prepared by the turbidity method (inoculum prepared in
0.4% saline with Pluronic®, then 0.1ml transferred to 25ml of inoculum Synergies
plus Pos Broth with Pluronic®) for a final inoculum concentration of 3-7 X 105
CFU/ml. Panels are incubated in a Walk-Away® System and read periodically
starting at 4.5 hours until sufficient growth to determine the MIC. Alternately the
panels may be incubated at 35o C in a non-CO for 16-24 hours and read by visual
2
observation of growth.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) M7 (M100-S17) “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
The WalkAway® SI uses a Colorimetric Optics System consisting of a color
wheel/lamp assembly and a Photosensor. There is an initial read at 2.5 hours with a
possible final read at 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 8, 12, 16, or 18 hours (overnight instrument
readings, manual readings) depending on the growth rate of the organism being
tested. The time of final read is dependent on the growth rate of the organism and
the sensitivity of the automatic reader since cell densities below 2 x 107 cells/ml are
not detected.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates tested at six sites on three
separate days in triplicate. The study included the testing on the Rapid
(WalkAway® SI read at <16 hours), Overnight Instrument (WalkAway® 16-
18 hour readings), and Overnight Manual (manual/visual read at 16-20 hours).
There are three dilution sequences included in this submission using different
reading algorithms namely 7-MIC Dilution sequence (i.e. 0.25 – 16 μg/mL), 5-
Dilution Breakpoint Sequence (i.e. 0.5 – 8 μg/mL), and the 3-Dilution Breakpoint
Sequence (i.e. 2 – 8 μg/mL). All dilution sequences were done on the same 10
isolates. The BP dilutions (5-Dilution Breakpoint Sequence, and the 3-Dilution

agreement. There were no isolates that did not grow. All results were >95%

Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC isolates, E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and S. aureus ATCC
29213 were tested a sufficient number of times with acceptable results most of
the time with the reference method. Quality control results demonstrated the
ability of the different reading parameters (manual and instrument) to produce
acceptable results.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical testing was conducted at six sites using fresh isolates supplemented
with stock isolates. A total of 610 gram-positive Staphyloccci and
Enterococci were tested of which 564 were fresh isolates and 46 were stock
isolates. There were 75 challenge isolates tested at two sites and compared to
the reference broth dilution result mode that was determined by previous
testing of each isolate multiple times in the recommended reference panel.
The Rapid method readings were obtained at times between 4.5 and 16 hours
of incubation for > 95% of the results. An additional comparison was done
with readings on the instrument after overnight incubation and also read
manually when incubated 16- 18 hours. Performance by these alternate
reading methods was also acceptable with no apparent differences or trends.
The test device had a no growth rate of <10%.
The recommended CLSI reference method was followed with the exception of
the use of a small amount (0.1%) Pluronic® in the final inoculum. A
validation of the use of Pluronic® in the frozen reference panels was
conducted. Similar calculations for the different reading methods were
performed with very little difference. QC was also performed with no
difference apparent in the results.
The charts below demonstrates the performance of all three reading methods
(Rapid instrument readings at <16 hours, overnight on the WalkAway® and
manually read at 18 hours using the touchScan®-SR) with the 7-Dilution
sequence when compared to the reference method.

EA-Essential Agreement maj-major discrepancies
CA-Category Agreement vmj-very major discrepancies
R-resistant isolates min- minor discrepancies
Essential agreement (EA) is when the MicroScan® Synergies plus panel agrees with the reference
test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference method. Category
agreement (CA) is when the MicroScan® Synergies plus panel interpretation agrees exactly with
the reference panel interpretation. Evaluable (Eval) are results that are within the test range and on
scale.
Similar results were obtained when the algorithm for reading the 3 Dilution
sequence with 2, 4 and 8 µg/mL wells and algorithm for reading the 5 Dilution
sequence with 0.5,1, 2, 4 and 8 wells were applied with no difference in CA. EA
was not calculated for these readings since insufficient numbers of concentrations
were available for the evaluation.
The E. faecium group had a higher than expected vmj error rate of 5.4% with the
Rapid read method. However, no vmj errors were observed with the overnight
instrument or overnight manual read methods. Therefore, a limitation statement
will be included for this drug/bug combination, e.g., “Hold all susceptible (<8
µg/mL) Enterococcus faecium isolates to overnight reporting (16/18 hours).”
