H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
MicroScan® Synergies plus™ Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel is used to
determine quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of
colonies grown on solid media of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative
anaerobic gram-positive enterococci and staphylococci. After inoculation, panels
are incubated for 4.5 – 18 hours at 350C +/- 10C in a WalkAway® - SI or
equivalent and read by the MicroScan® Instrument System. Additionally the
panels may be incubated in a non-CO incubator and the Antimicrobial
2
Susceptibility Testing (AST) portions can be read visually, according to the
Package Insert.
2. Indication(s) for use:
This submission is for the addition of the antimicrobial Streptomycin Synergy
Screen at a concentration of 1000 µg/mL for testing Enterococcus spp at 4.5-16
hours or 16-20 hours for an overnight reading.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
• E. faecium with the Rapid Read Method - hold Susceptible (<1000
µg/mL) results to overnight/manual reads (16-20 hours).
• E. faecalis with the Overnight Read Method - If E. faecalis overnight (16-
20 hr) reads are critical to patient care verify with WalkAway Instrument
read (footnote in the Instructions for Use Manual).
• Turbidity method of inoculum preparation only.
• For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
Each panel contains two control wells: a negative control well, and a growth control
well (contains test medium without antibiotic). Antibiotics are diluted in water,
buffer, or minute concentrations of broth to selected concentrations prior to
dehydration of the panels. The panel is rehydrated and inoculated at the same time
with 0.1 ml of suspension prepared by the turbidity method (inoculum prepared in
0.4% saline with Pluronic® - a wetting agent, then 0.1ml transferred to 25ml of

--- Page 3 ---
inoculum Synergies plus Pos Broth with Pluronic®) for a final inoculum
concentration of 3-7 X 105 CFU/ml. Panels are incubated in a Walk-Away® System
and read periodically starting at 4.5 hours until there is sufficient growth to determine
the MIC. Alternately the panels may be incubated at 35o C in a non-CO for 16-24
2
hours and read by visual observation of growth.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: “Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) M7 (M100-S17) “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
The WalkAway® SI uses a Colorimetric Optics System consisting of a color
wheel/lamp assembly and a Photosensor. There is an initial read at 2.5 hours with a
possible final read at 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 8, 12, 16/18 hours (overnight instrument readings,
manual readings), or 24 hours depending on the growth rate of the organism being
tested. The time of final read is dependent on the user customization, the growth rate
of the organism, and the sensitivity of the automatic reader since cell densities below
2 x 107 cells/ml are not detected.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using ten isolates tested at three sites on
three separate days in triplicate. The study included the testing on the
WalkAway® SI read at less than (<) 16 hours, WalkAway® 16-18 hour
readings and manual readings at 16-20 hours incubation. Acceptable
reproducibility (95%) was demonstrated with only category agreement (S, R)
since that is all that is detected.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Enterococcus
faecalis ATCC 51299 were tested a sufficient number of times with
acceptable results most of the time with the reference method. Both of the QC
isolates grow in the 4.5-18 hour window. Quality control results demonstrated
the ability of the different reading parameters (manual and instrument) to
produce acceptable results of greater than (>) 95%.
The following table provides the frequency of the results in each
concentration with the expected range stated.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical testing was conducted at three sites using Enterococci and the
MicroScan® Synergies plus™ Gram-Positive panel with Streptomycin
Synergy Screen (Test Panel) compared with a frozen reference panel. A total
of 374 gram-positive isolates were tested of which 297 were fresh isolates and
68 were stock isolates. Nine isolates were reported at greater than or equal to
(>) 16 hours and were not included as Rapid read results. Therefore, of the
374 isolates tested, 365 Rapid read isolates were analyzed. There were 83
challenge isolates selected from CDC challenge strains and stock organisms
tested at one site and compared to the reference broth dilution result mode that

were determined by previous testing of each isolate multiple times in the
recommended reference panel. Four challenge isolates were reported at >16
hours and were not included as Rapid read results. There were 68 isolates
from the verification testing which were tested in house. These isolates were
primary clinical isolates collected over time. A qualitative comparison only
was performed.
The Synergies plus™ readings were obtained at times between 4.5 and 16
hours of incubation for > 95% of the results. An additional comparison was
done with readings on the instrument after overnight incubation and also read
manually when incubated 16- 18 hours.
The recommended CLSI reference method was followed with the exception of
the use of a small amount (0.1%) Pluronic® in the final inoculum. A
validation of the use of Pluronic® in the frozen reference panels was
conducted. Similar calculations for the different reading methods were
performed with very little difference.
The charts below demonstrates the performance of all three reading methods
Rapid (WalkAway® SI, <16 hours) Overnight Instrument (> 16 hours on the
WalkAway® SI, 16/18 hours) and Overnight Manual (manual/visual read, 16
- 20) with the one dilution breakpoint when compared to the reference
method.
