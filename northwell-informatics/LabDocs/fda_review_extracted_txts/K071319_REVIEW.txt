Real Time Stability Testing: The Activated Clotting Time (ACT) Control Set
stability was determined by storing the product under the recommended
storage conditions (2-8ºC) for the life of the product. These studies were
conducted for three experimental lots (E-lots). Several vials of each level
were tested at each time point and the results of the real time stabilities
samples were compared to the results of reference vials stored at -70ºC
(Pseudo-T ). Failure was assumed to have taken place when the product’s
0
analyte results had changed by greater than or equal to the established
acceptance criteria, ±10% deviation of the reference values.

- Open vial stability: there is no open vial claim for this product. The package
insert provides the instruction to indicate that the “control solution must be used
immediately (less than 30 seconds) after completing the reconstitution and mixing
steps.”
