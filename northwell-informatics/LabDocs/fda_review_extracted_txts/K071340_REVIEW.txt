the reduction of oxalacetate to malate with the concomitant oxidation of reduced
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to NAD+. Spectrophotometric
determination of the decrease in absorbance monitored at 380 nm is proportional to
the amount of CO in the sample.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To determine the linearity range, the sponsor prepared ten CO test samples
2
through serial dilution of a 60 mmol/L bicarbonate standard made by
dissolving 0.252g of Sodium Bicarbonate in 50 mL deionized water. Test
samples concentrations ranged from 4.67 - 44 mmol/L. All ten CO levels
2
were run in duplicate on T60 analyzer. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria are
based on measurement values between 15-50 mmol/L with % recovery being
within 95 – 105% of the assigned values, and below 15 mmol/L, ±2mmol/L
from the assigned value. For the range tested, the linear regression analysis
demonstrated a linear regression equation, Y = 1.029X-0.564. The assay range
claimed by the sponsor is 5.0 - 40 mmol/L. The sponsor also conducted
studies to show the linearity of the reagent maintained through out the claimed
shelf life of one year using a reagent lot at the completion of one year storage
at 2-8oC. The linear regression analysis demonstrated equation, Y = 1.025X-
0.127. Using the same acceptance criteria, the sponsor claimed the linear
range of 5 – 40 mmol/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor’s protocols indicate that each calibrator (sCal), and control
(Nortrol and Abtrol) lot is traceable to the manufacturer’s primary reference
material. The values are assigned based on multi determinations performed
using T60 instruments. The assigned value is the median of all the values
generated for each calibrator and control. Additionally, control range is
calculated as the target value ± 2 standard deviations. The value assignment
sheet lists the lot-specific values.
In the labeling the sponsor recommends calibrating the test at least every three
days and every time a new reagent bottle is used. The sponsor also
recommends using quality control samples at least once a day, after each
calibration and when a new bottle is used. However, the sponsor also
suggests the control intervals must be adapted to the individual laboratory
requirement.
The sponsor claims that all open on-board reagents are stable for 5 days.
Based on the stability studies conducted, the sponsor claimed open vial

stability at 2 - 8°C is 7 days and shelf life (unopened) stability at 2 - 8°C is 4
years for calibrators and 3 years for controls.
d. Limit of Blank (LOB):
To demonstrate the limit of the blank, a serum matrix equivalent solution,
Serasub, containing no CO (blank sample) was tested in eleven replicates.
2
The sponsor defined the limit of zero-concentration (LOB) sample as ±3SD,
which was demonstrated to be 0.7467 mmol/L and 0.5022 mmol/L for
Serasub aged 2 months and 12 months, respectively. Along with the results
from linearity studies and LOB determined here, the sponsor established the
assay range of 5.0 – 40 mmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor evaluated the effect of some known endogenous and exogenous
interferents by spiking those substances in an aliquot of normal sera and
comparing with an unspiked aliquot of the same sample. The interferents and
the test range included hemoglobin (0 – 1000 mg/dL), lipemia (0 – 2000
mg/dL), unconjugated bilirubin (0 – 60 mg/dL), and conjugated bilirubin (0-
60 mg/dL). Based on the sponsor’s defined acceptance criteria on interference
limit of ± 10% of control, the results indicate that there are no interferences up
to the concentrations tested for any of the substances. The sponsor also
conducted CO reagent assay interference by sample hemolysate (0 – 1040
2
mg/dL) and based on the same acceptance criteria confirmed that there is no
interference up to 400 mg/dL.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance of the Carbon Dioxide (CO ) Reagent assayed on the T60
2
analyzer was compared with the results generated for the predicate device,
Roche CO -L, Bicarbonate Liquid (k032377) using 100 samples. The samples
2
consisted of 71 serum (range: 9.1 – 49.5 mmol/L) and 29 Li-heparin plasma
(range: 11.4 – 45.2 mmol/L). Comparison of the data based on two methods
for serum, plasma and samples as a total gave correlation coefficients of
0.9835, 0.9816, and 0.9825, respectively. Deming regression analysis for
serum, plasma and samples as a total resulted in the following equations, Y =
0.972X + 1.4; Y = 1.046X - 0.24; and Y = 0.978X + 1.23, respectively.
b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor conducted independent studies using serum and plasma to
demonstrate that the performance of the Carbon Dioxide Reagent is
substantially equivalent to the predicate, as described above.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not Applicable.

b. Clinical specificity:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not Applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range*:
The expected values of CO given for adult (22 – 29 mmol/L) were based on
2
literature. The sponsor recommends in the labeling that each laboratory determine
its own reference range.
