L. Test Principle:
When cystatin c from the sample is mixed with the Gentian cystatin c
immunoparticles, agglutination occurs. The created complex particles absorb light,
and by turbidimetry the absorption is related to the cystatin c concentration via
interpolation on an established standard calibration curve. The instrument platform
used for Gentian cystatin c measurement will automatically calculate the results.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed according to the CLSI EP6-A guideline.
Three different cystatin c serum samples (8.4, 6.3, 7.5 mg/L) were serial
diluted and tested in duplicate on the Roche Modular P analyzer. One high
serum sample of 8.77 mg/L was serial diluted and tested in duplicate on the
Abbott Architect c8000 analyzer. Acceptance criterion was a difference
between the expected values and the observed values of ± 12%. The linear
regression analysis between the expected values and the observed values are
shown as follows:
For Roche Modular P analyzer:
Y = 1.0366X – 0.0486, sample range tested = 0.57 to 8.4 mg/L
For Abbott Architect c8000 analyzer:
Y = 1.0198X + 0.00034, sample range tested = 0.63 to 8.8 mg/L
In addition, a low end linearity study was performed to determine the low end
linearity range of the Gentian cystatin c assay on the Modular P and Architect
c8000 analyzers. One serum sample of 1.53 mg/L cystatin c was diluted
serially and tested in duplicate on the Roche Modular P analyzer. Another
serum sample of 1.35 mg/L cystatin c was serial diluted and tested in

duplicate on the Abbott Architect c8000 analyzer. The linear regression
analysis between the expected values and the observed values are shown as
follows:
For Roche Modular P analyzer:
Y = 0.9546X – 0.0005, sample range tested = 0.34 to 1.53 mg/L
For Abbott Architect c8000 analyzer:
Y = 1.018X - 0.02639, sample range tested = 0.27 to 1.33 mg/L
The sponsor concluded that the linearity range of the Gentian cystatin c assay
on the Modular P analyzer is 0.34 – 8.4 mg/L and on the Architect c8000
analyzer is 0.27-8.8 mg/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Gentian cystatin c calibrator and control sets are calibrated by the use of
pure human cystatin c isolated from human urine and have a value assignment
traceable to an internal transfer protocol as recommended in ISO 17511
document. No international cystatin c reference material is available
currently. Gentian cystatin c calibrator and control set are made from
delipitated human serum pool spiked with human cystatin c.
The shelf life of the Gentian cystatin c immunoassay using the accelerated
stability study of the reagents showed that the reagents are stable for at least
18 months when stored at 2-4oC. Real-time stability study is still on going.
The open vial stability and the calibration curve stability was evaluated and
the open vial stability for the Gentian cystatin c immunoassay, calibrator, and
controls is 9 weeks at 2-8oC. The calibration frequency is every 4 weeks.
Sample stability was also performed and the sponsor claimed that the sample
is stable for at least 14 days at room temperature and 21 days at 2-8oC.
d. Detection limit:
A detection limit study was performed to assess the limit of detection for the
Gentian cystatin c assay on the Roche Modular P analyzer and the Abbott
Architect c8000 analyzer according to the CLSI EP17-A guidelines. LoD is
defined as the smallest amount of an analyte that the method can reliably
detect to determine presence or absence of the analyte. LoD was determined
by measuring 60 replicates of a zero cystatin c solution (saline) and 21
replicates of 8 dilutions of a normal serum within 4x LoB. LoQ was defined
as the lowest actual amount of an analyte that can be reliably detected and at
which the total error meets the requirements for accuracy. The LoQ criterion
was set to be the lowest cystatin c concentration corresponding to a CV below
6%. LoQ was conducted by running 3 additional dilutions of the same serum
in replicates of 15. The calculated LoD for the Modular P analyzer is 0.039
6

--- Page 7 ---
mg/L and LoQ is 0.37 mg/L. The calculated LoD for the Architect c8000
analyzer is 0.031 mg/L and LoQ is 0.40 mg/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were designed according to the CLSI EP7-A guideline.
Two pools of human serum with different concentrations of cystatin c were
tested with the known interference substances and analyzed in triplicate on the
Modular P and Architect c8000 analyzers. No significant interference was
defined as the observed value <7.5 % of the control value for low cystatin c
sample (<1 mg/L) and < 5% for high cystatin c sample(>1 mg/L).
i.)The sponsor claimed that there was no significant interference by the
following interferents:
For the Roche Modular P analyzer:
• Hemoglobin up to 7 g/L
• Bilirubin up to 800 mg/L
• Triglycerides up to 12.5 mmol/L
• Intralipid up to 16 g/L
For the Architect c8000 analyzer:
• Hemoglobin up to 8 g/L
• Bilirubin up to 420 mg/L
• Triglycerides up to 15 mmol/L
• Intralipid up to 11 g/L
ii.) The sponsor claimed that there was no significant interference by the
following drugs and anticoagulants:

iii.) Rheumatoid factor- The sponsor claimed that there is no RF interference
in the Gentian cystatin c immunoassay because the antibodies that they used
were originated from chicken egg (avian IgG should not cross react with
mammalian IgG). The above information is listed in the Interference section
of the package insert with the following reference: Larsson A et al: Poultry
Science 1993; 72:1807-1812.
iv.) Hook effect- The hook effect of the Gentian cystatin C immunoassay was
determined by using a spiked serum sample (80 mg/L) and making a serial
dilution and tested on the Modular P analyzer in duplicate. The sponsor
claimed that there is no hook effect observed in concentration above 16 mg/L.
v.) Carry over- Sample carry over of the Gentian cystatin C immunoassay was
evaluated on the Modular P analyzer and the Architect c8000 analyzer. The
acceptance criteria were set to ≤ 2.5%, precision ≤ 5%, and a non-significant
Student t-test. The experiment was designed based on CLSI EP10-A2
protocol. The total sample carry over was calculated to be 0.10% on Modular
P and 0.33% on Architect c8000 analyzer.

Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed based on the CLSI EP9-A2
guideline. Dade-Behring cystatin c method on the BN ProSpec analyzer was
used to compare the results performed using the Gentian cystatin c
immunoassay on the Roche Modular P and Abbott Architect analyzers. 74
serum samples were used for the comparison between the Modular P and BN
ProSpec analyzers. 87 serum samples were used for the comparison between
the Architect and BN ProSpec analyzers. Samples concentration range tested
for Modular P and Architect were 0.59 -7.47 mg/L and 0.52-7.91 mg/L
respectively. The method used to fit the linear regression line was Passing
Bablok. A summary of the regression statistics is provided below:

b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was conducted using 63 paired serum and EDTA
plasma samples from the same individuals. Testing was performed using the
Gentian cystatin c assay on the Modular P analyzer and Dade-Behring cystatin
c method on BN ProSpec analyzer. Results were analyzed using the Passing
Bablock regression and linear regression. Sample range tested was 0.46 – 0.91
mg/L. The acceptance criteria are: the plasma sample regression analysis falls
within the 95% confidence interval of the slope and intercept of the serum
analysis. Results are summarized as follows:

The sponsor states in the labeling that serum and EDTA plasma samples can
be used for the Gentian cystatin c determination.

Architect c8000 analyzer. The Passing Bablock regression analysis yielded the
following correlation equation: Y = 0.999X – 0.019, r=0.9991, sample range
tested = 0.61-7.50 mg/dL.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
In the labeling, the reference range is stated as 0.53 – 0.95 mg/L.*
*The reference range is based on the literature, on a reference interval study
performed by Dade Behring (predicate device) and referred to in the Dade
Behring N Latex Cystatin C Assay Package Insert. This reference interval was
determined from a population of ostensibly healthy subjects with no history of
renal disease. A total of 413 samples obtained from 194 males and 219 females
ranging in age from 1 to 78 years were tested at three evaluation sites. The
reference interval was calculated non-parametrically and represents the central
95% of the population tested. The sponsor claims that they followed the CSLI
C28-A guideline to determine the transferability of the reference range.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
