K071398
B. Purpose for Submission:
Traditional 510(k)
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Applied Spectral Imaging Ltd. (ASI)
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
The ScanView is indicated to detect the following cell types: CEP X Spectrum
Orange/CEP Y Spectrum Green DNA Probe Kit (Vysis, Inc. Downer’s Grove, IL)
and is limited to the analysis of CEP XY probes via high magnification capture and
analysis of interphase nuclei.
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The ScanView System is an integrated digital imaging system comprising an
external microscope, motorized multi-slide stage, camera, and a workstation. It is
designed to acquire images of cells and enables identification and examination of
cells of interest. Cytogenetics experts can view and scan cells and record the
images using both bright field and fluorescent illumination. The acquired images
can be enhanced, archived, retrieved, and printed. The automated microscope also
includes a motorized filter turret containing fluorescence filters.
2. Principles of Operation:
The ScanView system works with bright field and fluorescent samples with all
currently applied staining techniques. The system transfers images of cells from
the microscope to a computer where it is analyzed and processed. The operator
with the support of the ScanView software views the images. The results are
interpreted by a competent cytogeneticist who exercises his judgment in the use of
the provided information when formulating the diagnosis. The results are
documented in hard copy and archive.

Class II Special controls Guidance document: Automated Fluorescence in situ
Hybridization (FISH) Enumeration Systems. May 23, 2005.
J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
Measurements of 61 slides (bone marrow samples from leukemic patients at
different post-transplant periods, starting from 7 days up to 2 years and more)
using the manual gold standard were compared to results obtained by the
ScanView XY System. Regression of manual results on Scan results indicated
that:
• Scan and Manual are highly related with R-squares of 0.997,
0.997, and 0.980 for XY-percent, XX-percent, and their ratio
respectively.
• The slopes of the Manual-Scan regressions did not differ
significantly from 1.0 for all three parameters.
• The intercepts of the Manual-Scan regressions did not differ
significantly from 0 for all three parameters.
b. Precision/Reproducibility:
For the reproducibility study, 5 slides from 5 different patients were chosen
randomly from the 61 slides mentioned in the accuracy section above. In addition,
5 Vysis ProbeCheck control slides were also used to test reproducibility.
ProbeCheck Low Level Male Control Slides (95% XX, 5% XY) and ProbeCheck
Low Level Female Control Slides (95% XY, 5% XX) were tested.
Reproducibility standard deviations for XY-percent, XX-percent and their Ratio
were all 3.3% and below. Using these data a statistical model was constructed
from which population standard deviations were estimated. The modeled
standard deviations for XY-percent, XY-percent, and their Ratio ranged between
0.02% and 0.99%.
