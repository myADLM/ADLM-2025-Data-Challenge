The ADVIA Centaur® Cyclosporine Calibrator is for in vitro diagnostic use in
the calibration of the Cyclosporine assay on the ADVIA Centaur® System.
2. Indication(s) for use:
See intended use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use. See “Expected range” section, below.
4. Special instrument requirements:
ADVIA Centaur®
I. Device Description:
The ADVIA Centaur CsA kit contains one ReadyPack containing three primary
components: Solid Phase, Ancillary Well and Lite reagents.
The CsA solid phase reagent contains streptavidin-coated magnetic particles
stored in phosphate buffered saline with bovine serum albumin, mouse gamma
globulin, surfactant, and preservatives.
The CsA Lite Reagent consists of acridinium ester labeled CsA in phosphate
buffer with bovine serum albumin, surfactant, and preservatives.
The CsA Ancillary-Well reagent contains biotinylated mouse monoclonal anti-
CsA antibody in phosphate buffered saline with bovine serum albumin, mouse
gamma globulin, surfactant, and preservatives.
The CsA Sample Pretreatment reagent consists of a hypotonic solution of
detergents, glycerol, anti-foam and preservatives.
Two levels of calibrators are sold separately from the CsA kit. They contain CsA
in serum-based material, with detergent, preservatives, glycerol, and antifoam.
The calibrator contains human source material. While each donor unit was tested
by FDA-approved methods and found non-reactive to hepatitis B surface antigen,
antibody to hepatitis C, and antibody to HIV-1/2, all products using human source
material should be handled as potentially infectious. Because no test method can
offer complete assurance that infectious agents are absent, these products should
be handled according to established good laboratory practices.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
2

--- Page 3 ---
Abbott TDx®/FLx® Cyclosporine Monoclonal Whole Blood Assay
2. Predicate K number(s):
P890025 (Cyclosporine assays were subsequently down-classified into Class
II)
3. Comparison with predicate:
The two devices are similar in terms of intended use and indications for use.
Both are immunoassays using mouse monoclonal antibodies. Antibodies,
reagents, specific technologies, and instrumentation differ. The Advia Centaur
assay uses chemiluminescence; the predicate uses fluorescence polarization.
The Advia Centaur assay uses a 2-point calibration; the predicate device uses
a 6-point calibration.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document EP5-A2
L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA Centaur Cyclosporine assay is a competitive immunoassay using direct
chemiluminescent technology. Cyclosporine in the patient sample competes with
acridinium ester-labeled cyclosporine for a limited amount of biotin-labeled
monoclonal mouse anti-cyclosporine antibody. Biotin-labeled anti-cyclosporine binds
to streptavidin that is covalently coupled to paramagnetic particles in the Solid Phase.
In the ADVIA Centaur Cyclosporine assay the sample is manually pretreated to lyse
the cells and solubilize the cyclosporine. An inverse relationship exists between the
amount of cyclosporine present in the patient sample and the relative light units
detected by the system.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Precision and method comparison were determined at 3 external clinical sites, as well
as at the manufacturer’s site.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision evaluations included external study sites, (internal) manufacturer’s site,
and an additional evaluation near the upper limits of the assay. Evaluations are
described below:

--- Page 4 ---
External site imprecision evaluation:
At each of 3 external sites, assay precision was evaluated using 2 lots of
calibrators and 2 lots of reagents, over 5 days. Each day, 5 replicates were
evaluated in a single run. Each of the 5 replicates was separately pre-
treated/extracted. Spiked whole blood samples, patient pools, and whole blood
control materials were all evaluated at estimated concentrations shown in the table
below. Precision estimates were derived for within-run, between-day and within-
site (the latter includes within-run and between-day). Statistical analyses were
based on CLSI Document EP-5A. Results of a representative lot and site are
shown below. Results from other sites were similar.

The between-site CV for the samples shown in the table above ranged from 5.3%
(for concentrations near 171 ng/mL) to 7.7% (for concentrations above 1000
ng/mL).
Internal precision evaluation:
A 20-day study was performed according to CLSI, document EP05-A2. Three
replicates of calibrators and controls were assayed on each run. Data for the 20
days were analyzed using 2-point stored (day 0) calibration (n=120). Results for
1 representative lot are shown below.

Spiking recovery:
Cyclosporine was spiked into two cyclosporine-free whole blood samples and 2
whole blood samples from patients treated with cyclosporine. Sample were then
pretreated and evaluated on the Advia Centaur. Expected concentrations,
determined gravimetrically, ranged from 100-1500 ng/mL. Averaged recoveries
at (Advia Centaur measurement/ Expected concentration) ranged from 91% -
108% of the expected value, with no apparent concentration-dependent trends.

As part of the limit of quantitation evaluation, additional whole blood samples,
spiked to concentrations near the lower limit of the assay, were evaluated for
recovery. Averaged observed recovery (n=24) was 95% relative to expected
concentrations determined gravimetrically.
Dilution recovery:
Human whole blood samples were diluted to achieve concentrations across the
entire assay range. The recoveries ranged 90.7 to 108.5%, with no apparent
concentration-dependent trends (and averaged recovery 98%).
To validate the dilution recommendations for high samples, samples spiked to
levels higher than the claimed assay range were diluted with diluent, as
recommended in the package insert. Recoveries ranged from 91-107%.
The assay range is 30-1500 ng/mL based on the limit of quantitation, and
performance across this range in the analytical and method comparison studies.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
A two-point calibration is used for this method. The calibrators (two levels) are
sold separately from the assay kit. Calibrators do not need to be pretreated prior to
analysis.
The ADVIA Centaur Cyclosporine assay is standardized to an internal standard
manufactured using USP grade cyclosporine. Assigned values of calibrators and
controls are traceable to this standardization. Percent differences observed
between the control doses as read off multiple calibrator lots was within 5%.
Calibrator stability –Calibrator stability testing over the expiration dating period
demonstrated that results were within 10% of the day 0 or same day frozen
calibrator through 108 weeks.
d. Detection limit
A Limit of Quantitation study was modeled from CLSI EP-17with the time
limitation of using whole blood samples. Samples of whole blood from 5 donors
not taking cyclosporine were spiked to varying concentrations at low levels, down
to 12.5 ng/mL cyclosporine. The whole blood samples were mixed and left to
equilibrate overnight. Each spiked sample was extracted in replicates of 5 within
each day and this procedure was run for 5 days. The evaluation used stored
calibration from day 1. Performance estimated at 30 ng/mL includes within-lab
precision of < 20% and averaged recovery of within 95%.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity:
Cyclosporine-negative whole blood samples were spiked with ~200 ng/mL of
6

--- Page 7 ---
cyclosporine and 1000 ng/mL of each of the following metabolites: AM1, AM1c,
AM4n, AM9 and AM19. All 5 metabolites used in this experiment had purity
>95% as assessed by HPLC. Testing was across 3 reagent lots. The percents
cross-reactivity was calculated using the equation:
%Cross-reactivity= (([Metabolite] – [Control] )/ [Metabolite] )) x 100
observed observed added
The following cross-reactivity ranges were observed for the 3 lots:
AM1: 0.6-2.3%
AM1c: < 1%
AM9: 14-16%
AM19: ≤ 1.4%
AM4n: ≤ 1.7%
Potential interference by exogenous compounds:
Whole blood samples containing 200 ng/mL of cyclosporine were spiked with
potentially co-administered drugs and other exogenous compounds to
concentrations exceeding what would be expected in the intended use population.
ADVIA Centaur Cyclosporine assay results from the spiked samples were
compared with those of unspiked control samples. Observed recoveries were
within 92-107%. The compounds tested and their concentrations are listed in the
product package insert.
Endogenous compounds:
Whole blood EDTA samples were spiked with cyclosporine to a final
concentration near 200 ng/mL and potentially interfering endogenous compounds
were added. Some interference was observed at high concentrations of
triglycerides and cholesterol:
Triglycerides: 0 mg/dL control
350 mg/dL 111% recovery
500 mg/dL 92% recovery
900 mg/dL 87%
Cholesterol 0 mg/dL control
250 mg/dL 97%
300 mg/dL 90%
400 mg/dL 87%
The manufacturer includes the following limitations in the package insert:
High levels of triglycerides and cholesterol may result in low quantitation in
lipemic samples.
Average (n=3) percents recovery for cyclosporine in the presence of other
endogenous compounds are shown below:
Bilirubin 103% recovery at 40 mg/dL
Urea 90% recovery at 20 mg/dL
7

--- Page 8 ---
Albumin 97% recovery at 8 mg/dL
Biotin 95% recovery at 50 mg/dL
IgG 96% recovery at 12 mg/dL
Varying hematocrit levels between 12% and 59% were evaluated. Recoveries
ranged from 110% (for 12% hematocrit) to 98% (for 59% hematocrit).
The heterophilic antibodies tested were not observed to interfere; however, the
manufacturer includes the following limitation: Human serum can react with
reagent immunoglobulins, interfering with in vitro immunoassays. Routine
exposure to animals or animal serum products can cause interference and
anomalous values. Diagnosis may require additional information.
f. Assay cut-off:
A cutoff is not applicable for this quantitative assay.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were conducted at three external sites comparing the
ADVIA Centaur CsA assay against Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry
(LCMS), as well as against the Abbott TDx®/TDxFLx® Cyclosporine
Monoclonal Whole Blood immunoassay. Patient samples were selected to have
known characteristics (age, gender, location, time post-transplant, time of blood-
draw [C0, C2], transplant group). In addition, only EDTA whole blood stored < 2
days at 2-8 degrees C, or stored at -20 degrees C were selected. Samples were
largely from adults in the age range of 32-70 (but also included a few samples
outside this range). Samples were included from both men (n=165) and women
(n=83), and were obtained from more than 3 locations. Samples represented both
chronic (n=197) and acute (n=51) conditions as well as varying draw times (n=59,
for C2 (peak); n=189 for C0 (trough)). Regression results for each of these
subgroups are shown in the tables below.
A summary of results, as determined by Deming Regression, are described in the
following tables. Results are based on single measurements per sample.

b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable; the assay is for use with EDTA whole blood samples only.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable; clinical sensitivity and specificity are not typically reviewed
for this device type.
b. Clinical specificity:
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
No firm therapeutic range exists for cyclosporine in whole blood. The complexity
of the clinical state, individual differences in sensitivity to immunosuppressive
and nephrotoxic effects of cyclosporine, co-administration of other
immunosuppressants, type of transplant, time post-transplant, and a number of
other factors will cause different requirements for optimal blood levels of
cyclosporine. Each clinician should establish a range based on clinical experience,
and evaluate each patient before treatment adjustments are made. In addition,
ranges will vary according to the commercial in vitro diagnostic test used. Do not
use conversion factors between commercial assays to predict values for individual
patients. Consistent use of one assay for an individual patient is recommended
because of varying patterns of cross-reactivity with metabolites.
Measurements of cyclosporine should be used in conjunction with other
diagnostic procedures and clinical evaluation. Do not base changes in the
cyclosporine treatment regimen on individual cyclosporine values.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
