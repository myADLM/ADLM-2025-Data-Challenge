L. Test Principle:
The Dimension MPO reagent kit is a one step enzyme immunoassay based on the
“sandwich” principle. The sample is incubated with chromium dioxide particles coated with
mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for MPO, and conjugate reagent (B-galactosidase
labeled mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for MPO). A particle/MPO/conjugate forms
during the incubation period. Unbound conjugate is removed by magnetic separation and
washing. The sandwich bound B-galactosidase is combined with the chromogenic substrate
chlorophenol red-B-D-galactopyranoside (CPRG). Hydrolysis of CPRG releases a
chromophore (CPR). The concentration of MPO present in the patient sample is directly
proportional to the rate of color change due to formation of CPR measured at 577 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was conducted based on a modified version of a 20 day AN OVA
protocol (EP5-A2) using 3 levels of plasma pools (low, mid and high) and 2 control
levels with 7 reagent lots at three sites. Samples 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 8 were conducted at
the sponsor’s internal site. Samples 4, 7, 9 and 10 were conducted at two external
sites. Samples 8-10 below were tested using one lot with two plasma pools run in
triplicate at three sites over twenty days. The compiled table below shows the results
from both studies and a multi-site ANOVA summary.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was assessed in a recovery study according to CLSI EP6-A: Evaluation of
the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach. A
7-level dilution series (concentrations shown below) run in replicates of five were
prepared by mixing low and high patient samples. A linear regression equation was
conducted for expected results versus observed results. The resulting linear
regression equation is y=1.018x – 1.833 with a R2 of .999. The results of the
recovery study shown below and the functional sensitivity study shown in section d.
below support the sponsor claimed range of 20 to 5000 pmol/L.

7 (High) 5122 5122
The sponsor also conducted a hook effect study to assess samples above the range of
the test. Samples were prepared by spiking purified human MPO into a normal
human plasma base. The concentrations were verified by making a dilution with
human pooled plasma of known low analyte concentration so that the expected
value would fall within the MPO assay range. The samples were tested to
determine if high samples would give erroneous results. The MPO assay upper
range is 5000 pmol/L. Samples whose signals either exceed the upper assay range
limit or cause the instruments protected feature are flagged as “Above Assay
Range”. Based on the results from the study and the additional features of the
instrument, the sponsor reports that there was no observed hook effect for samples
up to 800,000 pmol/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
No reference standard is available for myeloperoxidase. An anchor pool was
prepared from patient reference samples which consisted of native analyte in human
serum. A master pool was derived from the anchor pool which is a 5-level liquid
working standard of purified analyte in BSA. The initial master pool is assigned
from the anchor pool during a patient sample method comparison spanning the
assay range. All subsequent master pools are assigned using a set protocol on
multiple instruments. The working calibrator materials are assigned values based on
the master pool using a set protocol on multiple instruments.

The two MPO controls have the same formulation and approximate values as the
MPO calibrator levels 2 and 4 (500 and 3000 pmol/L) and are made from
independent production runs.
Stability
The sponsor conducted a closed vial calibrator/control stability study in which 3 lots
of five levels (approx. 0, 500, 1000, 3000, 5375 pmol/L) of calibrators (stored at -20
C) were tested in replicates at time increments between 0 and 13 months. The study
results support the sponsor’s calibrator/control stability claim of 13 months.
The sponsor conducted an open vial stability study in which 2 vials of each level
were assayed in triplicate for 15 days. The open vial results were compared with an
unopened vial for 15 days. The study results support the sponsor’s
calibrator/control stability claim of 14 days when stored at 2-8 C°.
The sponsor conducted a sample stability study to determine the specimen types and
the temperature required for sample storage. 20 EDTA plasma samples (10 collected
in house and 10 from a blood bank) and 20 lithium heparin plasma samples (10
collected in house and 10 from a blood bank) were frozen at -20 C. Calibration was
conducted daily and the samples were tested in replicates of 5 at day 0, month 1,
month 3 and month 6 with the MPO reagent. The results support the sponsor’s 6
month sample stability claim when frozen at -20° C.
The sponsor conducted a further sample stability study to determine the number of
storage days for a sample if stored at 4° C. Ten paired EDTA and Lithium Heparin
samples were stored at 4° C and were run in triplicate with the reagent. The results
support the sponsor’s 6 day sample stability claim when stored at 4° C.
The sponsor conducted a freeze-thaw stability study to determine the number of
times a sample containing myeloperoxidase could be thawed. The paired lithium
heparin and EDTA plasma samples from the anticoagulant study in the matrix
comparison section 2b below were assayed fresh and then frozen at -70°C. The
samples were thawed, assayed in replicates of five and then refrozen. The results
support the sponsor’s freeze thaw statement within the package insert of “MPO
levels in EDTA and heparinized plasma have been shown to be stable through three
freeze/thaw cycles.”
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor conducted a limit of the blank study according to CLSI EP17 in which
calibrator 1 (0 pmol/L) was assayed 20 consecutive times. The limit of the blank is
13 pmol/L which is the mean value (n=20) plus two standard deviations of the level
1 (0 pmol/L) MPO Calibrator.

--- Page 9 ---
The sponsor conducted a functional sensitivity study (one run per testing day for 20
days). Four separate studies (3 in-house sites and 1 external site) were conducted
with five human plasma pools with low MPO concentrations. The within-lab
precision versus the mean MPO concentration was plotted. The functional
sensitivity estimate for each study was read as the MPO concentration giving a 20%
CV within-lab precision. The results per site ranged from 7 pmol/L to 16 pmol/L
which support the sponsor’s functional sensitivity claim of 20% CV at 20 pmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor conducted an interference study according to CLSI EP7-A2. Bias was
defined as the difference in the results between the control sample (without the
interferent) and the test sample (contains the interferent) expressed in percent. The
sponsor’s acceptance criterion was that a bias exceeding 10% was considered as
significant interference. Myeloperoxidase samples with concentrations between 481
and 2000 pmol/L were tested for bilirubin (conjugated and non-conjugated), lipemia
and hemoglobin. The results showed no significant interference for hemoglobin up
to 1000 mg/dL, bilirubin (conjugated and non-conjugated) up to 60 mg/dL and
lipemia (Intralipid) up to 3000 mg/dL
Cross reactivity was studied using potentially cross-reacting substances
commercially purchased. The substances were spiked into samples containing 0 and
approximately 1500-2000 pmol/L myeloperoxidase. Percent cross-reactivity was

the following: new Q-waves, old Q-waves, or non-specific T wave abnormality; and
44.75% had none of the aforementioned changes on ECG. Patients were assessed
for major adverse cardiac events (MACE) which includes myocardial infarction,
recurrent ischemia associated with ECG changes, recurrent ischemia requiring
hospitalization or revascularization, and death. Incidence of MACE was assessed by
a review of medical records and/or medical database searches. Patients were
excluded: if the chest pain was due to trauma or if they were apparently healthy
individuals. The demographics of the patients are shown in the table below.

Odds ratios were determined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression
models. Each MPO quartile was compared versus MPO quartile 1 for the outcomes
of MACE at the 30 day and 180 day intervals post-presentation. The multivariate
analysis included the following variables in addition to MPO: age, sex, race, history
of hypertension, history of hyperlipidemia, smoking status, history of diabetes,
white blood cell count (WBC), and the following cardiac markers: Dimension®
troponin I (CTNI), NTproBNP (PBNP) and hsCRP (CCRP). Results of the
univariate and multivariate analysis are displayed in the following two tables below.

confidence intervals. Odds ratios (shown below) were calculated for MPO
separately and after adjustment for age, gender, Troponin I, NT-proBNP, C-reactive
protein, white blood cell count, ST-segment depression, history of hypertension,
history of hypercholesterolemia, history of diabetes, and smoking status. In each
analysis the first quartile served as the reference group for calculation of odds ratio.

ROC analysis was conducted to determine if MPO is a significant predictor of the
ROC curve (or area under the curve (AUC) after adjustment for covariates such as
race, gender, hyperlipidemia, CRP and troponin (chart shown below). MPO did not
have a statistically significant added effect over Troponin I, which could be due to
competing effect of MPO and Troponin I or simply a difference in their biological
variation.

Further analysis of the clinical data was made by stratifying patients using the upper
limit of the MPO reference interval (633 pmol/L) and Dimension Troponin I at the
99th percentile (0.07 ng/mL). The analysis shows that patients at risk for MACE
within 30 and 180 days were identified significantly more often for MPO>633
pmol/L than for MPO ≤633 pmol/L when Troponin ≤0.07 ng/mL.

The results showed that MPO is a significant predictor of MACE at 30 days and at 6
months and supports a substantial equivalence decision.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor conducted a reference range study using EDTA samples per CLSI protocol
C28-A2 How to Define and Determine Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory;
Approved Guideline—Second Edition. The sponsor selected the lower, one-sided 95%
region of results obtained with the assay in a healthy population as the Dimension®
MPO reference interval.
The sponsor includes the following in the labeling:
“In a study of 286 EDTA plasma samples from apparently healthy individuals, the
reference interval encompassing the lower 95% region for the Dimension® MPO
method was as follows:
N Range encompassing the lower 95% region
286 51–633 pmol/L
Each laboratory should establish its own expected values for MPO as performed on the
Dimension® system.”
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
