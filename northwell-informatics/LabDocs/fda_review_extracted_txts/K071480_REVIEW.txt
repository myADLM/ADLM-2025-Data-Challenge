L. Test Principle:
The LIAISON® 25 OH Vitamin D assay is a direct, competitive chemiluminescent
immunoassay (CLIA) for quantitative determination of total 25 OH vitamin D in
serum or plasma. During the first incubation, 25 OH Vitamin D is dissociated from its
binding protein and binds to the specific antibody on the solid phase. After 10
minutes the tracer (vitamin D linked to an isoluminol derivative) is added. After an
additional 10 minute incubation, the unbound material is removed with a wash cycle.
Subsequently, the starter reagents are added to initiate a flash chemiluminescent
reaction. The light signal is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units
(RLU) and is inversely proportional to the concentration of 25 OH vitamin D present
in calibrators, controls, or samples. The light signal is measured by a photomultiplier
as relative light units (RLU) and is inversely proportional to the concentration of 25
OH Vitamin D present in calibrators, controls, or samples.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The DiaSorin LIAISON® 25 OH Vitamin D TOTAL Assay has a measuring
range of 4.0 to 150 ng/mL.
In order to test linearity, a set of five high clinical samples or serum samples
spiked with concentrated 25 OH Vitamin D, two of which had values above
the upper limit of the assay range, were diluted with the recommended diluent
and tested. Samples were diluted to several expected concentrations and all
samples were assayed in a single assay with 2-4 replicates each. Samples
tested covered the claimed measuring range of the assay. The data from the
study showed the following regression equation:
Y = 0.9893X + 0.0904
R2 = 0.9878
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators are traceable to concentrations determined by UV
spectrophotometric analysis. The antigen concentration of the ethanolic stock
is spectrophotometrically calculated in triplicate using the extinction
coefficient at 265 nm in the equation;
Conc. (µg/mL) = (O.D. ) x (400.65 mg/mmol) (1 cm) x 1000 µg/mg
265
18,300 mL mmol-1 cm-1
The ethanolic stock of antigen is used to build an intermediate stock
volumetrically by dilution into vitamin-free serum based on the
spectrophotometric reading of the stock. The intermediate stock is used in the
manufacture of Master Calibrators. Master Calibrators are manufactured
gravimetrically. For each manufacturing build, calibrators are built
gravimetrically from the intermediate stock. The Master Calibrators serve as
an anchor to confirm future manufacturing builds of calibrators. The
calibrator levels for each manufacturing build are confirmed when run as
unknowns using a minimum of 3 LIAISON® instruments with 2 approved 25-
OH Vitamin D kits with Master Calibrators. Replicates of 6 are obtained and
assays must pass specifications. Concentrations must fall within the specified
range. Once confirmation of the calibrator values is established, the new
calibrators are tested again in bulk and final.

Testing of the Controls and assignment of values involves 5 assays, 2
instruments, 3 approved Reagent Integrals and 20 reps of each control. The
assigned values for each control must be 15 ng/mL (±15%) and 50 ng/mL
(±15%).
Stability testing protocols for both calibrators and controls were reviewed and
determined to be adequate.
d. Detection limit:
LoD: The Limit of Detection study was performed according to CLSI EP17-
A. The zero calibrator is assayed as 10 replicates in duplicate and a low
calibrator (2 ng/mL) is assayed as 5 replicates in duplicate. Testing was
performed on three separate instruments.
The mean signal and standard deviation are determined for the zero calibrator
and for the low calibrator on each instrument.
The limit of detection (as per CLSI EP17-A) was determined in three runs on
three separate instruments to be 0.60, 0.56 and 1.28 ng/mL.
LoQ: The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) study was performed according to
CLSI EP17-A.
Eight serum specimens at concentrations near the limit of detection of the
assay were prepared. Specimen values ranged from 1.7 to 10.6 ng/mL. All
specimens were tested in 7 assays in replicates of 6 for each assay (for at least
40 replicates) on three separate instruments.
For each instrument’s assays, the sample mean, standard deviation, and % CV
for each sample were calculated. The mean concentrations (X-axis) vs. %
CVs (Y-axis) were plotted. LoQ is defined as the lowest concentration at
which the polynomial regression line crosses the 20% CV line.
This study was run on three separate instruments and determined to be 3.9, 3.5
and 3.5 ng/mL. The LoQ claim is 4 ng/mL. Specimens with results under 4
ng/mL are reported as < 4 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering substances: An evaluation of potential assay interferences was
performed to assess the performance of the LIAISON 25OH Vitamin D
TOTAL assay when potential contaminants are present in a sample. Testing
was done according to CLSI EP7-A2.
Three sample pools with 25OH Vitamin D at low, medium and high
therapeutic concentrations were spiked with the interferants, extracted and
tested. Assay performance was unaffected by hemolysis (up to 200 mg/dL
hemoglobin), lipemia (up to 549 mg/dL triglycerides), bilirubinemia (up to 20
mg/dL bilirubin) or cholesterolemia (up to 259 mg/dL cholesterol).
Cross Reactivity: Three serum samples were each spiked with a cross
reactant at a specific concentration, listed below. The samples were compared
to the unadulterated samples and the percent cross reactivity was calculated.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Serum samples were obtained from clinical reference laboratories, previously
obtained archived samples and ongoing specimen collection projects. A total
of 155 samples were tested by the LIAISON® 25OH Vitamin D TOTAL
Assay and a vitamin D radioimmunoassay (k983617).
The distribution of sample values (by radioimmunoassay result) across the
assay measuring range of <4 – 150 ng/mL is shown in the following table.
Assay Number of

(ng/mL)
0-10 12
10-20 39
20-40 44
40-100 51
100-150 9
The study results showed correlation between the two methods as follows:
y = 0.99x + 2.4, R = 0.97
b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study comparing serum, SST serum, EDTA plasma, and
lithium heparin plasma samples was performed. 52 patient samples and 11
spiked samples were tested that covered the claimed measuring range.
Performance of the SST serum and the plasma samples were compared to
serum samples. The subset of the same set of samples was also tested after
one freeze thaw cycle and each sample type was compared to the fresh
