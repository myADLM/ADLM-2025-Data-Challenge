4. Panel:

H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
HomeCheckTM Multiple Drug cup test device for Amphetamine (cutoff at
1000ng/ml) , Methamphetamine (cutoff at 1000ng/ml), Benzoylecgonine
(cutoff at 300ng/ml), Benzodiazepine (cutoff at 300ng/ml for Oxazepam),
Marijuana (cutoff at 50ng/ml), Morphine (cutoff at 2000ng/ml),
Phencyclidine (cutoff at 25ng/ml ), Methadone (cutoff at 300ng/ml),
Oxycodone (cutoff at 100ng/ml), Tricyclic Antidepressant (cutoff at
1000 ng/ml for Nortriptyline HCl), and Barbiturates (cutoff at 300ng/ml
for Secobarbital).
2. Indication(s) for use:
The assay provides a simple and rapid analytical screening procedure to
detect single or multiple different abused drugs (Amphetamine,
Methamphetamine, Benzoylecgonine, Benzodiazepine, Marijuana,
Morphine, Phencyclidine, Methadone, Oxycodone, Tricyclic
Antidepressant, and Barbiturates in human urine.
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more
specific alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a
confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography /mass spectrometry
(GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. HPLC is preferred
confirmatory method for Tricyclic Antidepressant.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
This test is intended for over the counter (OTC) consumer use as the first
step in a 2-step process to provide consumers with information concerning
the presence or absence of the above stated drugs in a urine sample.
Information regarding the confirmatory testing - the second step in the
process-, along with materials for shipping the urine specimen to the
laboratory is included with the test. There are no uniformly recognized
levels for Benzodiazepine, Oxycodone, Tricyclic Antidepressant, and
Barbiturates. The test is not intended to screen individuals who are
prescribed these drugs by a physician; the test may yield positive results
for individuals taking such drugs, as prescribed.
4. Special instrument requirements:

I. Device Description:
The test consists of chromatographic absorbent strips inserted within a sample
collection cup and home use labeling with supplies and instructions for obtaining
laboratory confirmation for preliminary positive results (at no additional cost).
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Tianjin New Bay Forsure Rapid One Step Multiple(X) Abuse Drug Screen Test
2. Predicate K number(s):
k052882
3. Comparison with predicate:
The new device is for home use; the predicate device is for prescription use.
Therefore, the new device provides users with additional instructions and supplies
for obtaining confirmation. The physical device is the same as the predicate
except that the home use device does not include propoxyphene, which is present
on the professional use device.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were referenced.
L. Test Principle:
As the test sample flows through the absorbent strip, the colloidal gold labeled
antibody-conjugate binds to the free drug in the specimen forming an antibody-
antigen complex. This complex competes with immobilized antigen conjugate in the
Test reaction zone, with the result that no color band is produced if there is drug in
the sample above the detection levels (stated in the intended use). In addition,
unbound colloidal gold-labeled antibody conjugate binds to the reagent in the
negative control zone, producing a color band, to indicate that sufficient sample was
added.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All analytical performance characteristics were reviewed previously under
k(052882). See http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/reviews/k052882.pdf. Therefore this
current 510(k) submission includes the lay user study only. See 3.c. “other

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
d. Detection limit:
e. Analytical specificity:
f. Assay cut-off:
The identified cutoff concentrations for amphetamine, cocaine,
methamphetamine, opiates 2000, Phencyclidine and THC are those
recommended by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA). The SAMHSA has not recommended a cutoff
concentration for Barbiturate, Benzodiazepine, Oxycodone, and Tricyclic
Antidepressant (TCA). Characterization of how the device performs
analytically around the claimed cutoff concentration appears in the precision
and detection limit sections for the predicate (k052882). See
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/reviews/k052882.pdf
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
See 3.c., below
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. The test is only for urine specimens.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not typically reviewed for this device type.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not typically reviewed for this device type.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The HomeCheck One Step Drug Cup Screen test was performed and
interpreted by 103 lay users using spiked, masked, urine samples.

Volunteers were selected as they presented themselves at the participating
U.S. site. Participants represented diversity in age (20-72), gender (75%
male), education (7% non-high school graduates; 69% high school graduates;
21% some college education; 6% post-graduate or technical) and occupation.
Each participant performed one multiple drug cup test using a spiked masked
urine sample. Each sample contained a combination of drugs (4-6 drugs) at
varying concentrations above and below the cutoff concentration. Drug
concentrations in the samples included low negative, 50% below the cutoff,
25% below the cutoff, 25% above, 50% above, and high positive for each
drug. Each participant performed the test independently using the proposed
labeling, with no additional instructions, and recorded results for all 11 drugs
in the test. After testing, the participants also answered questions to help
evaluate whether the tests could be performed and interpreted by lay users.
Test results are tabulated below compared to results of GCMS (and HPLC for
TCA) for each drug.

Participant Procedure Questionnaire:
After testing, participants responded to surveys with questions to help
determine whether participants understood test instructions.
These included questions to the participant on whether they had any difficulty
running the test, reading it at the appropriate time, seeing the test line, and
whether there was anything in the labeling that they found confusing.
Participants were given the opportunity to rate various features of the labeling
(clarity, illustration, directions) on a scale of 1-5. Responses indicated that
99-100% of participants felt the test was not difficult to run, read, or interpret,
and that labeling was understandable.
Additional questions were included to address test interpretation issues such
as test line darkness/faintness, importance of confirmation testing, and
possibility for false positives from certain foods or drugs, as well as issues
concerning testing and confirmation of prescription drugs. Participant
