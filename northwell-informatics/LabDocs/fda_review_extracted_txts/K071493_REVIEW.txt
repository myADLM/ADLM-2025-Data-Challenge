L. Test Principle:
Once a whole blood sample is applied to the sample chamber of the test strip, the
process of glucose measurement commences. Glucose measurement is based on
electrical potential caused by the reaction of glucose with the reagents contained on
the strip’s electrodes. The glucose in the sample is oxidized by the enzyme glucose
oxidase, producing gluconic acid. The electrical current resulting from this
enzymatic reaction is measured and converted to glucose concentration by the meter.
The magnitude of the current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated within-day precision of the device using whole blood
samples spiked with five different glucose concentrations, three different
reagent lots, and 10 different TD-4209 glucose meters. Each combination of
multivariate factors was evaluated using 10 measurements. Day-to-day
precision was evaluated using three glucose control solutions with
concentration levels, low, normal, and high. The day-to-day precision was
evaluated over a ten-day period using three different reagent lots and ten
TD-4224 glucose meters. The summary of test results is presented below.

The test strip TD-4306 provided in the new device is also intended to measure
blood glucose levels in neonates, which is a high risk population. To cover the
neonate glucose range, with-in day precision using whole blood samples was
evaluated for glucose levels at the lower range from 20 to 100 mg/dL prepared
with dextrose to obtain five different glucose concentrations. Tests were done
for three different reagent lots, and 10 different TD-4209 glucose meters.
Results are summarized in the table below. The sponsor’s acceptance
criterion is CV less than 5%, however, at glucose level 20-25 mg/dL, the CV
is 9.63%.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor used nine spiked whole blood samples in the range (20-600
mg/dL) as reference values and compared with the values generated from
YSI-2300 analyzer. A regression analysis showed linearity of Clever Chek
TD-4209, Clever Chek TD-4222, and Clever Chek TD-4225 blood glucose
monitoring systems with correlation coefficients (R2) of 0.998, 0.999, and
0.999, and with regression equations y = 0.96X + 6.5, y = 0.97X + 4.32, and y
= 0.96X+ 7.754, respectively.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

sponsor provided data to confirm the stability of both strips and control
solutions for 90-day period recommended in the package insert. The sponsor
included the protocols for strip calibration procedure in the labeling. The
sponsor also provided the traceability and value assignment procedure for
control solutions used in this device. The sponsor conducted studies to
evaluate the in-use stability of the TD-4209 glucose monitoring system at the
assigned temperature range of 50oF-104oF (10oC-40oC). Using control
solutions at low, medium and high concentration tested at 50oF and 104oF
compared with room temperature, results showed <2% CV for all glucose
concentrations and met the acceptability criterion (<5% CV).
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor has not conducted studies to determine the limit of detection
(LOD), however, as supported by linearity studies, the sponsor has established
the measuring range of 20 - 600 mg/dL for the Clever Chek TD-4209, Clever
Chek TD-4222, and Clever Chek TD-4225 Blood Glucose Monitoring
Systems.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor tested the following exogenous and endogenous substances for
interference. Two glucose levels (75-85 mg/dL and 300 mg/dL) were tested.
Interferents and the levels tested were, Acetaminophen (0-20 mg/dL),
Ascorbic acid (0-3 mg/dL), Dopamine (0-12.25 mg/dL), Uric acid (0-20
mg/dL), Triglycerides (0-2000 mg/dL), and Bilirubin (0-20 mg/dL). Based on
acceptance criterion of a mean glucose difference of ± 10% of the glucose
values obtained in the absence of interfering substances, the following
conclusions were drawn with regard to interfering substances.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor demonstrated that the Clever Chek TD-4209/TD-4222/TD-4225
Blood Glucose Monitoring System for finger stick is equivalent to a standard
reference method (YSI-2300). Samples from 156 volunteers with glucose
concentrations distributed over the range of 21 – 568 mg/dL were evaluated at
three different laboratory sites. Percent distribution of the samples
corresponding to the glucose concentration ranged as follows: 20-50 mg/dL –
10%; 51-110 mg/dL – 32%; 111- 150 mg/dL – 32%; 151-250 mg/dL – 10%;
251- 400 mg/dL – 10%; and 401-600 mg/dL – 6%. To obtain the blood
glucose concentrations less than 40 and more than 400 mg/dL, a pooled
capillary whole blood specimen was spiked with the desired glucose
levels. Based on data analysis, device met the minimum system accuracy

Glucose Monitoring System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for
additional readings.
2. Software:
FDA reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types in k041107. See k041107 for more
information.
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are
applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger,
the palm, the forearm, the upper-arm, the calf, and the thigh only. For
neonates, healthcare professionals may use this device for glucose testing
from whole blood from the heel. Since the whole blood sample is applied
directly to the test strip, there are no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
A code strip is provided with each batch of test strips to calibrate the meter for
that batch. No further calibrations are required of the user.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at two different concentrations to be run with this
device are included in the device. When a test strip is inserted into the meter,
the control mode can be activated. This prevents control results from being
stored in the internal memory. An acceptable range for each control level is
printed on the test strip vial label. The user is referred to the troubleshooting
section of the owner’s manual if control results fall outside these ranges.
