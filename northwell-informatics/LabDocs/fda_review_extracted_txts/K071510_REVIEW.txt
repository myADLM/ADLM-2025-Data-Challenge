H. Intended Use:
HerpeSelect® Express is a rapid test intended for qualitatively detecting the presence or
absence of human IgG class antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) in human
whole blood (venous or capillary) or serum. The test is indicated for testing sexually
active adults or pregnant women to aid in the presumptive diagnosis of HSV-2 infection.
The HerpeSelect® Express IgG device has not been established for use in the pediatrics
population, for neonatal screening, or for testing immunocompromised patients. This kit
is not intended for self-testing, and this test is neither FDA cleared nor approved for
testing blood or plasma donors.
3) Special conditions for use statement(s): Prescription use only
4) Special instrument requirements: No special instruments are required for the device
I. Device Description: The HerpeSelect® Express IgG is a rapid one step qualitative
test for detection of human IgG class antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2)
in human whole blood (venous or capillary) or serum samples based on lateral flow
immunochromatographic assay. The test is indicated for testing sexually active adults or

pregnant women for aiding in the presumptive diagnosis of HSV infection. It is a Class II
noninvasive device individually packaged in a foil pouch. The device contains three
separate active components (purified native HSV-2 antigen, recombinant HSV-1 antigen,
and anti-human IgG antibody) bound onto a nitrocellulose membrane, a buffer pad and
conjugate pad enclosed in a plastic housing. The conjugate pad carrying dried antibody-
gold conjugate specific for human IgG is located between the sample well and buffer pad.
The HSV-2 antigen is the test line and anti-human IgG antibody is a control line. HSV-2
positive result in the sample is indicated by the formation of pink lines in both test and
control regions. Pink line formation only in control region verifies the device
functionality, not an indication of HSV-2 positive results. Recombinant HSV-1 antigen
pre-absorbs the HSV-1 antibodies from the sample and is hidden in the device; therefore,
HSV-1 line formation is not visible in the test.
During testing, whole blood (venous or capillary) or serum is applied into the
sample application well and filtered through the blood separation membrane and
absorbed into the test strip; the test housing lid is opened; buffer is applied in the buffer
port to cause the antibody-gold conjugate specific for human IgG and sample to migrate
via capillary action through the nitrocellulose membrane into the result region of the
device and generates a chromogenic reaction (pink line) in the presence of HSV-2.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
a) Predicate device name (s):
The HerpeSelect® 1 and 2 immunoblot
Reference Method for clinical evaluation: HerpeSelect® 1 and 2 immunoblot
b) Predicate K numbers (s):
K000238
Comparison with predicate: Two devices were listed as predicate devices. The
HerpeSelect2 Immunoblot IgG was the typing reference method for clinical data
evaluation and calculation of sensitivity and specificity.
Note: It is important to compare the device detecting HSV-2 to a well characterized
western blot or a FDA cleared immunoblot for the purpose of clinical data evaluation.

L. Test Principle:
The HerpeSelect® Express is a qualitative immunochromatographic assay in a plastic
cartridge that contains three separate active components (purified native HSV-2 antigen,
recombinant HSV-1 antigen, and anti-human IgG antibody) bound onto a nitrocellulose
membrane, a buffer pad and conjugate pad enclosed in a plastic housing. The conjugate
pad carrying dried antibody-gold conjugate specific for human IgG is located between the
sample application well and buffer pad. Sample is applied to the sample well and is
allowed to filter through the nitrocellulose membrane for 30 sec. The buffer is applied in
the buffer port to cause the antibody-gold conjugate specific for human IgG and sample
to migrate via capillary action through the nitrocellulose membrane into the result region
of the device and generates a chromogenic reaction (pink line) in the presence of HSV-2.
Positive test is indicated by formation of pink line in the test zone (for HSV-2 IgG
present in the sample) and control zone (human IgG present in the sample). In case of
negative sample, no pink line is seen in test zone while formation of pink line in control
zone will indicate the functionality of the device.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility: A reproducibility study was conducted at three
external US laboratories i.e. Rocky Mountain Region of the United States; a student
health clinic in the Southeastern United States, and an Sexual Transmitted Disease (STD)
clinic located in the Pacific Northwest. Reactivity for the reproducibility samples was
determined using ELISA index range. Based on the ELISA Index (shown in the
following table, column 1), a coded panel of 10 samples was prepared to represent low to
mid positive analyte levels and was tested at all three sites on three days by three
operators. The Inter/Intra-operator and Inter/Intra-site reproducibility results are
summarized in the following tables.

e. Analytical specificity:
1. Cross Reactivity: The cross-reactivity studies for the HerpeSelect® Express were
designed to evaluate potential cross reactivity from immunoglobulins (IgG) directed
against closely-related members of the herpes virus family that may clinically confused
with herpes simplex (e.g. HSV-1, VZV, CMV, EBV, rubella virus) and from other
conditions that may result from atypical immune system activity (e. g. rheumatoid factor
(RF), anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA). A total of 213 sero-positive samples for one of the
closely related members (HSV-1, VZV, CMV, EBV, rubella virus, RF, ANA) were
shown negative by testing with the HerpeSelect2 ELISA IgG predicate device. These
samples were further tested with the HerpeSelect2 Express IgG. Test results from the
HerpeSelect2 Express IgG showed only 4.2% (9/213) of combined cross reactivity with
these samples.

2. Interference: The device performance was evaluated with the presence of interferents.
Sera from two subjects were selected by HerpeSelect ELISA IgG for the interference
studies:
i) One serum positive for herpes simplex virus-2 and negative for herpes simplex virus-1.
ii) One serum negative for both herpes simplex virus 1 and herpes simplex virus 2.
These serum samples were divided in two aliquots. One aliquot was used to establish
baseline levels for triglycerides, albumin, bilirubin, and hemoglobin for each subject. The
commercially available interferents were used to spike the other aliquot at the level (e.g.
triglycerides 10 mg/ml, albumin 60 mg/ml, bilirubin 0.2 mg/mL, hemoglobin 220
mg/mL) which exceeded the expected human range. The spiked samples were tested
again in the assay to determine if the elevated levels of interferents affected the assay.
There was no effect of the interferents on the performance of this assay.

2. Comparison studies:

b. Matrix comparison: Serum, Blood (Venous and Capillary)
Since the HerpeSelect® Express IgG intended use lists venous blood collected
in the EDTA treated tubes as well as capillary blood as an additional specimen
type, analytical matrix equivalence studies were conducted to demonstrate the
equivalence between serum and blood matrics. Negative serum and negative
whole blood matrics were spiked with HerpeSelect®2 ELISA IgG positive
serum. The two spiked samples were serially diluted (1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16) with

matrics without spiking and undiluted spiked samples. Each sample was tested
in triplicate. Three of three whole blood replicates showed end-point at 1:4

4. CDC Panel: Focus Diagnostics tested 100 samples from CDC panel that includes 65
negative and 35 positive specimens. The CDC panel samples tested with the
HerpeSelect2 Express IgG showed 100% of positive (35/35) and 98.5% of negative
agreement (64/65) with the CDC results.

4. Clinical cut-off: NA
5. Expected values/Reference range:
As described earlier, the device was assessed and compared with the predicates for
masked, prospected samples from two populations i.e. (pregnant women, n=410 and
sexually active adults, n=575) and non-sexually active adults (low prevalent
populations, n=104) and. The observed prevalence and the hypothetical predictive
values were determined for high prevalent populations (pregnant women and sexually
active adults). Results for all three matrics from negative and positive samples were
shown very close agreement with the reference predicate device HerpeSelect 2
Immunoblot IgG and other predicate device HerpeSelect 2 ELISA IgG.
