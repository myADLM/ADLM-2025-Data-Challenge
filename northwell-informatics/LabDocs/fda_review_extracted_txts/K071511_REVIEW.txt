4. Panel:
Immunology and Microbiology Devices
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Focus Diagnostics PlexusTM HerpeSelect® HSV 1 and 2 IgG (with software) is
intended for qualitatively detecting the presence or absence of human IgG antibodies to
HSV-1 and HSV-2 in human sera. The test is indicated for pregnant women and sexually
active adults, as an aid for presumptively diagnosing HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection. The
predictive value of a positive or negative result depends on the population's prevalence
and the pretest likelihood of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection. The test is not intended for
donor screening or for self-testing. The performance of this assay has not been
established for use in a pediatric population, for neonatal screening, for testing of
immunocompromised patients, for use by a point of care facility or for use with
automated equipment.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use.
The device is for prescription use only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Not applicable.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The assay is intended to be used with the Luminex xMAP instrument with Luminex IS
2.3 software or the Bio-Rad BioPlex® 200 System.
I. Device Description:
The Focus Diagnostics Plexus™ HerpeSelect® HSV 1 and 2 IgG (with software) is a
multiplexed immunoassay for qualitatively detecting and differentiating human IgG
antibodies to HSV-1 and HSV-2. The optional Plexus™ Multi Analyte Diagnostic
Software version 1.0.0.2 automates the calculation of results using the Luminex xMAP
reader with Luminex IS 2.3 software.

L. Test Principle:
The Focus Diagnostics HerpeSelect®1 and 2 Plexus IgG uses an Antigen Bead suspension
that contains two distinct HSV antigen bead types that fluoresce at different wavelengths
and/or intensities: gG-1 beads and gG-2 beads. The Focus Diagnostics HerpeSelect®1 and
2 Multiplex IgG is a three step procedure.
1. Patient sera are diluted, and the diluted sera are incubated with Antigen Beads. If
HSV antibodies are present, then the antibodies bind to the corresponding antigen
beads.
2. Phycoerythrin⎯conjugated goat anti-human IgG, (Conjugate) is added, and the

Conjugate binds to the bound HSV antibody (if present), and forms a Conjugate-HSV
antibody-antigen bead sandwich.
3. Fluorescence from each distinct HSV antigen bead type is measured and compared
against a Cut-off Calibrator.
