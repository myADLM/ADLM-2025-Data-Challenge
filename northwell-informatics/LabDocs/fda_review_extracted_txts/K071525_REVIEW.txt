L. Test Principle:
The Activated Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) assay is a clinical chemistry assay
in which the aspartate aminotransferase catalyzes the transfer of the amino group
from L-aspartate to α-ketoglutarate, in the presence of pyridoxal-5’-phosphate,
forming oxaloacetate and L-glutamate. Oxaloacetate in the presence of NADH and
malate dehydrogenase (MDH) is reduced to L-malate. In this reaction the NADH is
concomitantly oxidized to NAD. The reaction is monitored by measuring the rate of
decrease in absorbance at 340 nm due to the oxidation of NADH to NAD.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed using CLSI Document EP5-A as a
guideline. The total precision as well as the precision for each component of
variation (between-day, between-run, and within-run) was evaluated for AST.
On one c8000 instrument, four control levels (two at normal, two at abnormal
analyte concentrations) were tested; the high test sample was within the
FlexRate Method range. On the remaining instruments, two control levels at
normal and abnormal analyte concentrations were tested. A five-day
precision study for the Activated AST assay was run on three c8000 systems,
one AEROSET System and one c16000 System. Testing consisted of two
runs per day, five replicates per run (a total of 50 data points). Samples used
were either commercial control material, normal serum pool or spiked serum
pool.

Initial precision testing demonstrated that results were equivalent across the
platforms, so one full 20-day protocol was continued on 3 c8000 Systems, two
runs per day, two replicates per run, two control levels only (a total of 80 data
points on each instrument tested).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To establish the linearity of the assay, a study design was used based on CLSI
protocol EP6-A: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement
Procedures: a Statistical Approach: Approved Guideline.
The claimed measuring range for this assay is 5 - 1,985 U/L on all three
instruments, extending up to 5,364 U/L using FlexRate linearity. A serum
pool with very low AST was spiked with commercially available AST to
obtain the high AST sample then diluted with saline (the recommended
diluent). A minimum of nine samples at concentrations spanning the claimed
linear range of the assay (5 – 5400 U/L) were run in a minimum of four
replicates. The assay recovery was within ± 10% or ± 8 U/L of the expected
result at all tested concentrations.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The shelf-life and on board stability testing protocols for the AST reagent and
the acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
To determine the limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ), a
study design was used based on CLSI protocol EP17-A: Protocols for
Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation.
Twenty replicates of two low AST samples were run on three instruments
each of the AEROSET system, a c8000 and a c16000. To determine the LoQ,
test levels near the linear low for the AST Activated assay were run in
replicates of 10, on three instruments, two runs per instrument.
Conclusions: The LoD was calculated to be 3.8 U/L. The Limit of
Quantitation (LoQ) was calculated to be 5 U/L and was defined as the
concentration of the analyte demonstrated imprecision less than or equal to
20% CV.

e. Analytical specificity:
Human serum samples at the clinical decision point of the analyte were spiked
with various levels of interferents. A minimum of four replicates of each
interferent level and four replicates of reference sample were run. The percent
recovery was determined by dividing the mean result of each interferent
sample by the mean result of the reference sample. The level of interference
was considered acceptable if there was no more than ± 10% difference
between the interferent result and the reference result. Testing was performed
using the ARCHITECT c8000.
The percent interference was within ± 10% difference for serum samples
containing up to 60 mg/dL bilirubin; 62 mg/dL hemoglobin; and 500 mg/dL
Intralipid at the clinical decision point.
The sponsor did not test other commonly used medications and other
endogenous substances and referred the user to literature for other
interferences known to affect AST assays.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The Abbott Activated AST assay was compared to the predicate device using
CLSI Document EP9-A2 as a guideline for the method comparison study.
Note: any samples with AST concentrations above 993 U/L were diluted prior
to testing on the predicate, but were undiluted when testing with the proposed
device.
AEROSET: to evaluate the proposed device (Activated AST on the
AEROSET) vs. the predicate device (AST Activated on the Abbott
AEROSET (k981221), 104 clinical serum and plasma samples and 26 spiked
serum samples ranging from 14-4993 U/L were tested.
Correlation coefficient = 0.999
Slope = 1.06
y-intercept = -3.79 U/L
ARCHITECT c8000 system: To evaluate the performance of the proposed
device (Activated AST) vs. the predicate device (AST Activated on the
Abbott AEROSET (k981221), 104 clinical serum and plasma samples and 26
spiked serum samples ranging from 14 – 4993 U/L were tested.
Correlation coefficient= 0.999
Slope = 1.01
y-intercept = -4.15 U/L.

ARCHITECT c16000 system: To evaluate the performance of the proposed
device (Activated AST on the ARCHITECT c16000) vs. the predicate device
(AST Activated on the Abbott AEROSET (k981221), 104 clinical serum and
plasma samples and 26 spiked serum samples ranging from 14 – 4993 U/L
were tested.
Correlation coefficient= 0.999
Slope = 1.03
y-intercept = -3.75 U/L.
b. Matrix comparison:
Blood was drawn from 37 subjects, some samples were spiked with various
concentrations of AST to achieve samples that spanned the entire measuring
range (17 – 5000 U/L), and processed to produce a full set of matched
specimen types (serum, lithium heparin plasma, sodium heparin plasma,
EDTA plasma, plasma gel tube (PST) and serum gel tube (SST)). The percent
difference seen when using other sample types compared to serum was within
± 10% for all samples tested.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The stated reference range for AST in serum and plasma of 5 – 34 U/L in adults1
is based on published literature. The sponsor recommends that each laboratory
determine its own reference range based on its particular locale and population
characteristics.
