510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
K071562
B. Purpose for Submission:
Original Traditional 510(k)
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
DREW Scientific, Inc., D3 Hematology analyzer
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
16 Quantitative hematology parameters
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The D3 Hematology analyzer is a stand-alone benchtop, clinical laboratory
instrument which analyzes in-vitro samples of whole blood to provice complete
blood count and leukocyte 3-part differential count using the impedance and
spectrophotometry techniques.
2. Principles of Operation:
The impedance principle of electrical resistance is used for cell counting and
sizing of WBCs, RBCs, and Plts. This is combined with optical absorbance of
cyanmethemeglobin for hemoglobin. The technology combines to give a full CBC
with 3-part differential in just under one minute.
3. Modes of Operation:
Open Tube
4. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification is manual alphanumeric entry. A bar-code reader is an
optional accessory.

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Manual sample handling using a sampling needle on the front of the instrument.
6. Calibration:
Calibration is automatic or manual using DREW EX-CAL manufactured by R&D
Systems.
7. Quality Control:
Quality control is performed using DREW EX-TROL control materials (high,
normal and low levels), manufactured by R&D Systems. The D3 stores up to 100
results per control batch for 6 different Lots. Results of each lot can be viewed as
tables or through Levy-Jennings graphs.
8. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and Software Development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No________ Software documentation was provided at a
Moderate Level of Concern.
F. Regulatory Information:
1. Regulation section:
21 CFR 864.5220, Automated differential cell counter
2. Classification:
Class II
3 Product code:
GKZ
4. Panel:
Hematology (81)
G. Intended Use:
