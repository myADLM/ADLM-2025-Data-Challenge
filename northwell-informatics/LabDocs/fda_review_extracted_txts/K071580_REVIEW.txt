L. Test Principle:
AST catalyses the transfer of amino group from aspartate to oxoglutarate during the
formation of glutamate and oxaloacetate. Oxaloacetate is reduced to malate by malate
dehydrogenase (MDH). During this conversion, an equivalent amount of NADH is
oxidized to NAD. The resulting decrease in absorbance at 340 nm is directly
proportional to the activity of AST in serum.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Following CLSI EP5-A, the sponsor evaluated the precision using two lots of
reagents and three levels of commercially available serum controls on T60
analyzer. Studies were carried out in duplicates of two runs per day over 20
days (total of 80 data points). The results are tabulated below.

different samples to determine the linearity. For 1-reagent method, the sample
panel with eight analyte levels, Document Enzyme Linearity Test Set E100 (0
– 384 U/L), was used and four parallel measurements were made at each level.
Based on the acceptance criteria ±10% and one of four measurements out of
specification acceptable, the sponsor claimed assay range of 4 – 350 U/L for
1-reagent method. For the 3-reagent method, the sponsor used normal human
sera spiked with commercially available AST preparation and made 11
analyte levels (5 – 380 U/L) for testing. Each analyte was measured four times.
Based on the same acceptance criterion in 1-reagent method and based on the
limit of blank (LOB) described below as 2 U/L, the sponsor claimed
measuring range of 4 – 300 U/L for 3-reagent method.
To demonstrate the extended measurement range, the sponsor used normal
human sera spiked with AST enzyme preparation and made ten dilution steps
from the highest concentration down to normal human sera. With maximum
allowable bias of ±10% from the estimated straight line, the sponsor claimed
extended range of 4 – 2100 U/L for 1-reagent and 4 – 1800 U/L for 3-reagent
methods.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor’s protocols indicate that calibrator (eCal) is traceable to the
reference procedure given in the value sheet, which is IFCC reference
procedure for 3-reagent method and molar absorbance coefficient of NADH
for 1-reagent method. The controls (Nortrol and Abtrol) are traceable to the
IFCC procedure. The values are lot-specific and are assigned based on multi
determinations performed using several T60 instruments. The assigned value
is the median of all the values generated for each calibrator and control.
Additionally, control range is calculated as the target value ± 2 standard
deviations. Please refer to the value assignment sheet in the labeling for lot-
specific values.
To ensure adequate quality control, the sponsor recommends calibrating the
test at least every three days and every time a new reagent bottle is used. The
sponsor also recommends using quality control samples at least once a day,
after each calibration and when a new bottle is used. However, the sponsor
also suggests the control intervals must be adapted to the individual laboratory
requirement.
The sponsor claims that all open on-board stability for reagents is 14 days.
Reagent in unopened vial is stable at 2-8˚C until expiration date on vial label
when protected from light.
d. Limit of Detection:
To demonstrate the lower limit of the assay range, the sponsor used a 0.9%
Sodium Chloride solution (blank sample) and tested in 20 replicates. The
sponsor defined the limit of zero-concentration (Limit Of Blank) sample as
+3SD, which was demonstrated to be 1.425 U/L for 1-reagent method and
1.73 U/L for 3-reagent method. Based on this information, the sponsor
claimed 2 U/L as the lower limit of the detection.

e. Analytical specificity:
Following instructions in CLSI document EP7-A, the sponsor evaluated the
effect of known endogenous interferents. The interferents and the test range
included hemoglobin (0 – 250 mg/dL), Lipemia (0 – 200 mg/dL), and
bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated). Three levels of analyte
concentrations were used: low level sample using normal human sera (1-
reagent method) or normal human sera diluted with 0.9% NaCl (3-reagent
method); medium level sample from normal human sera spiked with AST
enzyme preparation; high level sample from normal human sera spiked with
AST enzyme preparation. Interference studies were conducted for both 1-
reagent and 3-reagent assay formats. Based on the acceptance criteria of ±
10% or ±2.5 U/L of control (non-interfered) value, the sponsor claimed for
both 1-reagent and 3-reagent method, no interference for Lipemia up to 150
mg/dL. For bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated), no interference were
demonstrated for 1-reagent method up to 35 mg/dL, and 3-reagent method up
to 58 mg/dL. The results of hemolysate studies demonstrated interference for
hemolysate concentrations as low as 46 mg/dL for 1-reagent and 31 mg/dL for
3-reagent methods, depending on the analyte (AST) concentration. Thus, the
sponsor recommends not using hemolyzed samples.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance of the AST (IFCC) 1-reagent and 3-reagent methods on T60
analyzer was compared with the results generated for the predicate device,
Bayer ADVIA IMS Aspartate Aminotransferase on ADVIA 1650 instrument
using 85 serum samples. The samples were split and run on both devices in
duplicates. Comparison of data based on predicate and the device produced
correlation coefficients (r) of 0.992 and 0.994 for 1-reagent and 3-reagent
methods, respectively. Deming regression analysis for 1-reagent and 3-reagent
methods resulted in the equations, y = 0.95x-2.0 and y = 0.94x+1.3,
respectively. Sample measurement range for 1-reagent method was 12 – 307
U/L and 3-reagent method was 15 – 408 U/L. Based on the sponsor’s
acceptance criteria of r ≥ 0.9, the method comparison demonstrated substantial
equivalence of the new device to the predicate.
b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor conducted matrix comparison studies using 45 matched serum
and plasma samples for both 1-reagent (sample range: 5.6 – 356 U/L) and 3-
reagent (sample range: 12.7 – 324 U/L) methods. The samples were run in
duplicates. The results generated correlation coefficients (r) of 0.99 and 0.98
for 1-reagent and 3-reagent methods, respectively. Deming regression analysis
for 1-reagent and 3-reagent methods resulted in equations, y = 0.99x+1.54 and
y = 0.98x+0.73, respectively. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion for serum
and plasma was r ≥ 0.9.

serves.
