I. Device Description:
The RAMP Influenza A/B Assay is a qualitative immunochromatographic test that
utilizes the RAMP® 200 reader for the differential determination of Influenza A and
Influenza B in nasal wash/aspirate, nasopharyngeal aspirate, and nasopharyngeal swab
samples. A wash/aspirate or swab sample is mixed with Sample Buffer using Assay Tip
containing fluorescent-dyed latex particles coated with monoclonal antibodies targeting
the Influenza A and B nucleoproteins, and applied into the sample well of the Test
Cartridge. The sample migrates along the strip. Fluorescent-dyed latex (test) particles,
coated with anti-Influenza A and anti-Influenza B nucleoprotein monoclonal antibodies

--- Page 3 ---
bind to Influenza A or B nucleoprotein antigens, respectively, if present in the sample. As
the sample migrates along the strip, Influenza-bound particles are captured at either the
Influenza A or the Influenza B detection zone which is coated with either anti-Influenza A
or anti-Influenza B nucleoprotein monoclonal antibodies, respectively. Excess
fluorescent- dyed particles are captured at the internal standard zone. RAMP® 200 reader
then measures the amount of fluorescence emitted by the complexes bound at the two
detection zones (Influenza A and Influenza B) and at the internal standard zone. The
RAMP® 200 reader calculates a ratio (RAMP Ratio) of each influenza zone (A or B)
fluorescence reading to the internal standard zone fluorescence reading. The reader
compares these ratios to pre-defined threshold limits to determine a positive or negative
result for Influenza A and Influenza B in the tested sample.

L. Test Principle:
The RAMP Influenza A/B Assay is a qualitative immunochromatographic test that
utilizes the RAMP® 200 reader for the differential determination of Influenza A and
Influenza B in nasal wash/aspirate, nasopharyngeal aspirate, and nasopharyngeal swab
samples. A wash/aspirate or swab sample is mixed with Sample Buffer using Assay Tip
containing fluorescent-dyed latex particles coated with monoclonal antibodies targeting
the Influenza A and B nucleoproteins, and applied into the sample well of the Test
Cartridge. The sample migrates along the strip. Fluorescent-dyed latex (test) particles,
coated with anti-Influenza A and anti-Influenza B nucleoprotein monoclonal antibodies
bind to Influenza A or B nucleoprotein antigens, respectively, if present in the sample. As
the sample migrates along the strip, Influenza-bound particles are captured at either the
Influenza A or the Influenza B detection zone which is coated with either anti-Influenza A
or anti-Influenza B nucleoprotein monoclonal antibodies, respectively. Excess
fluorescent- dyed particles are captured at the internal standard zone. RAMP® 200 reader
then measures the amount of fluorescence emitted by the complexes bound at the two
detection zones (Influenza A and Influenza B) and at the internal standard zone. The
RAMP® 200 reader calculates a ratio (RAMP Ratio) of each influenza zone (A or B)
fluorescence reading to the internal standard zone fluorescence reading. The reader
compares these ratios to pre-defined threshold limits to determine a positive or negative
result for Influenza A and Influenza B in the tested sample.
The RAMP® 200 is a general use fluorometer that analyzes results produced by
immunoassays that use a fluorophore having an excitation wavelength of 560 nm and an
emission wavelength of 610 nm.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the RAMP Influenza A/B Assay was evaluated using a
panel of 6 simulated samples that included high negative, low positive (the assay
LoD) and moderate positive (2 X the assay LoD) Influenza A or Influenza B
samples. The influenza strains used to prepare the simulated samples were
Influenza A/Hong Kong/8/68 and Influenza B/Lee/40. The influenza strains were
re-titered prior to testing. Panel samples were tested in triplicates at each of the 3
testing sites by 2 operators for 5 days using 1 RAMP Influenza A/B kit lot (6
samples X 3 replicates X 2 operators X 5 days X 3 sites = 540). The overall
percent agreement for the RAMP Influenza A/B Assay was 100%, with no
significant differences within run (same operator on same day), between run,
operators, and sites. The RAMP Flu A/B assay is a qualitative assay based on
numerical RAMP Ratio values. The overall RAMP Ratio %CV across all sites
ranged from 9.6% to 15.1% depending upon analyte type and concentration tested.

f. Analytical specificity:
The analytical specificity of the RAMP Influenza A/B Assay was evaluated by
testing a panel consisting of 17 bacteria and 15 viruses that may be present in the
nasal cavity or nasopharynx. Bacterial isolates were tested at 106cfu/mL and viral
isolates were tested at approximately 105 TCID /mL at n=3 replicates each. The
50
bacterial and viral organisms were re-grown and re-titered prior to cross-reactivity
testing. Analytical specificity of the RAMP Influenza A/B Assay was 100%.

g. Assay cut-off:
The lot-specific Threshold 1 (Normal cut-off) values and the fixed Threshold 2
(Extreme cut-off) values are programmed into the lot-specific Lot Cards and
thus the RAMP Ratio values are invisible to the end user. Only negative or
positive results are displayed. The Lot Card provides the reader with information
specific to the lot, including lot number, expiration date, thresholds and standard
curve information.
A. Threshold 1 (Normal cut-off):
1) Each RAMP Influenza A/B kit has lot-specific Threshold 1 levels. The
Threshold 1 values (separate values for Influenza A and Influenza B) for
each lot are based on QC testing data of the specific combination of
component lots (Sample Buffer, Test Cartridge, and Assay Tips) used in
the Influenza A/B kit lot. QC testing is performed on each kit lot to ensure
that the lot meets release specifications as well as to provide the data to set
the Threshold 1 values.
The algorithm used to determine the lot-specific Threshold 1 values is the
same for each lot and uses defined calculations based on the results of the
QC testing data of that lot, and the Threshold Factors that were based on
the clinical trial results to optimize sensitivity and specificity of the RAMP
Influenza A/B test (ROC Optimization).
B. Threshold 2 (Extreme cut-off):
1) During development of the RAMP Influenza A/B Assay, it was observed
that when testing clinical samples with extremely high concentrations of
Influenza A, there appeared to be interference in the Influenza B Assay
potentially resulting in a False Positive Influenza B result in addition to the
true positive Influenza A result. Testing was performed on the four
Influenza A/B kit lots manufactured for the clinical trials to characterize
this interference between multiple lots of the Influenza A/B Assays. Based
on this testing, it was observed that the interference was very reproducible
between kit lots. Threshold 2 values of 20,000 for Influenza A and 10,000
were arbitrarily set. The pre-determined "extreme" Threshold 2 values are
fixed values and are applied to all test kit lots.
2) Based on this characterization of the interference of high levels of
Influenza A antigen in the Influenza B Assay, an algorithm was derived to
provide Threshold 1 for clinical samples that are negative or have low to
moderate levels of Influenza A, but to switch to Threshold 2 if a double
positive (Influenza A and Influenza B) was determined and the level of
Influenza A was extremely high.
Because a simultaneous double infection of Influenza A and Influenza B in
the same patient is exceedingly rare, the algorithm and Threshold 2 values
11

--- Page 12 ---
were biased towards minimizing the possibility of displaying a double
Influenza A positive and Influenza B positive result.
h. Interfering Substances:
Whole blood and a number of other potentially interfering substances
(medications and over the counter (OTC) products) that may be present naturally
or artificially introduced in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx were evaluated in
the RAMP Influenza A/B Assay. The substances were added to a negative
sample (viral transport media), an Influenza A LoD positive sample (300
EID /mL), an Influenza A 2x LoD positive sample (600 EID /mL), an
50 50
Influenza B LoD positive sample (316 EID /mL) and an Influenza B 2x LoD
50
positive sample (632 EID /mL) and tested at n=3 replicates each in the RAMP
50
Influenza A/B Assay. The influenza strains used to prepare the samples were
Influenza A/Hong Kong/8/68 and Influenza B/Lee/40. These influenza strains
were re-titered prior to interference testing.
None of the substances tested at the concentrations indicated interfere with the
test results of negative or positive Influenza A and Influenza B samples in the
RAMP Influenza A/B Assay. The RAMP Flu A/B assay is a qualitative assay
based on numerical RAMP Ratio values. The Percent of Mean Control Ratio
values were calculated using these RAMP Ratios.

i. Transport Media Compatibility:
Eight transport media (six commercial transport media and two clinical site
prepared transport media) were evaluated for compatibility in the RAMP
Influenza A/B Assay by testing a negative sample (transport media only), an
Influenza A LoD positive sample (300 EID /mL), an Influenza A 2x LoD
50
positive sample (600 EID /mL), an Influenza B LoD positive sample (316
50
EID /ml), and an Influenza B 2x LoD positive sample (632 EID /ml) at n=3
50 50
replicates each in the RAMP Influenza A/B Assay. The influenza strains used to
prepare the samples were Influenza A/Hong Kong/8/68 and Influenza B/Lee/40.
These influenza strains were re-titered prior to media testing.
All negative samples (media only) tested negative. All inoculated samples
(media with Influenza A or Influenza B) tested positive for the appropriate virus.
The RAMP Flu A/B assay is a qualitative assay based on numerical RAMP
Ratio values. The %CVs were also calculated for the RAMP Ratios. None of the
tested transport media interfered with the performance of the RAMP Influenza
A/B Assay.

j. Sample Collection Swabs Compatibility:
Four swab materials were evaluated for compatibility in the RAMP Influenza
A/B Assay by testing a negative sample (swab alone with no virus present), an
Influenza A LoD positive sample (300 EID /mL after extraction), an Influenza
50
A 2x LoD positive sample (600 EID /mL after extraction), an Influenza B LoD
50
positive sample (316 EID /mL after extraction), and an Influenza B 2x LoD
50
positive sample (632 EID /mL after extraction) at n=3 replicates each in the

were Influenza A/Hong Kong/8/68 and Influenza B/Lee/40. These influenza
strains were re-titered prior to swab testing. Each swab was dosed with 20 μL of
the appropriate sample and extracted into 3 mL Copan Universal Transport
media by vortexing for 30 seconds to get the target concentration for each
sample prior to testing in the RAMP Influenza A/B Assay. Each replicate tested
was prepared from a separate swab. Swabs made of sterile foam, polyester,
nylon, or rayon were evaluated. The RAMP Flu A/B assay is a qualitative assay
based on numerical RAMP Ratio values. The %CVs were also calculated based
on the RAMP Ratios for the testing
The negative sample (swab alone) tested negative. At least two of three of each
swab type inoculated with Influenza A or Influenza B at the LoD tested positive
for the virus.

k. Sample Stability Testing:
The RAMP Influenza A/B Assay was evaluated to determine the effect of time
of storage of the sample at 2-8ºC to assess stability of detection of the antigen in
the sample. Clinical samples from the British Columbia Centre for Disease
Control (BCCDC) equivalent to those tested in the clinical trial were thawed and
diluted in viral transport media to simulate samples that were close to the
Threshold 1 ratio values. The clinical samples were then tested immediately and
after 72 hours storage at 2ºC and 8ºC.
The results indicate that samples tested in the RAMP Influenza A/B Assay are
stable for at least 72 hours when stored at 2-8ºC.

a. Prospective Clinical studies
The performance of the RAMP Influenza A/B Assay was compared to cell culture in
a prospective study conducted as part of a multi-center trial in North America during
the 2006-2007 influenza season when influenza A/H3 (36.5%) and A/H1 (63.5%)
were the predominant Influenza A viruses in circulation1. Four independent
laboratories (located in distinct geographic regions) evaluated the RAMP Influenza
A/B Assay in parallel with cell culture. Eight hundred Forty-four (844) fresh
specimens (nasal wash/aspirate, nasopharyngeal aspirate, or nasopharyngeal swab
samples) prospectively collected during the 2006-2007 influenza season were tested.
Across the sites these samples were drawn from an approximately equal mix of
pediatric (0 – 21 years) and adult patients (21+ years) with approximately equal
numbers of male and female patients. The mean (standard deviation) age of the
patients was 28.6 (30.7) years. The results of the prospective clinical trials based on
sample type are given in the following tables:

b. Retrospective Clinical studies
In order to supplement the prospective study, performance of the RAMP
Influenza A/B Test was also evaluated by two independent laboratories
comparing to the original cell culture testing results (cell culture testings were
performed originally using fresh specimens) on 75 retrospective frozen clinical
nasopharyngeal swab samples and 130 retrospective frozen clinical
wash/aspirate samples. The results of the retrospective clinical trials based on
sample type are given in the following tables:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The prevalence of Influenza varies each year with epidemics occurring during the
fall and winter months in the US. Variables that affect the rate of positivity
observed in respiratory testing include: the efficiency and timing of specimen
collection, handling and transport of the specimen, the time of year, age of the
patient, and local disease prevalence. During the 2006-2007 US respiratory
season, the combined prevalence of Influenza A and Influenza B was 13.2%1. In
the 2007 RAMP Influenza A/B multi-center clinical study (samples collected
between January and April), the prevalence as observed with culture of Influenza
A was 13.2% (111/844), Influenza B was 2.5% (21/844).
N. Instrument Name:
RAMP® 200 reader
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The RAMP® 200 measures the amount of fluorescence emitted by antibody/antigen
complexes bound at two detection zones (Influenza A and Influenza B) and at the internal
standard zone. The RAMP® 200 calculates a ratio (RAMP Ratio) using the fluorescence
reading of each detection zone (A and B) and the internal zone. The reader compares
these ratios to predefined threshold limits to determine a positive or negative result for
Influenza A and Influenza B in the tested sample.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
User enters Patient ID/Sample ID using either the touch screen of the Control
Module or optional barcode scanner.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Not applicable
5. Calibration:
1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2007. Update: Influenza activity--United States and worldwide, 2006-07
season, and composition of the 2007-08 influenza vaccine. MMWR 56(31); 789-794.

Each box of test strips is supplied with a Lot Card containing the calibration
information for each specific manufacturing lot. The Reader determines the lot
information by reading the barcode on the bottom of each Test Cartridge and
reports the result based on the fluorescence ratio calculated for the Cartridge and
comparing it to the specific lot information loaded into the memory from the
associated Lot Card.
6. Quality Control:
When the RAMP® 200 is turned on, it performs a Self-Test which verifies the
system calibration, the cartridge transport mechanism and the Reader optics.
During the self-test the system also determines remaining battery power, verifies
the system clock and verifies the instrument calibration. In addition, the RAMP®
200 has an Internal Quality Control (IQC) function. IQC can be scheduled to be
performed at a pre-specified interval (1-24 hours) and takes less than 1 minute to
complete. The IQC function repeats all the start-up checks and ensures
appropriate instrument operation.
The RAMP® 200 scans the entire length of the Assay strip within the Cartridge.
There are 2 areas on the strip to which the fluorescently labeled antibodies bind,
the “detection zone” and the “internal standard zone”. The Reader monitors the
sample flow across the length of the Assay Strip. Should an operator delay for too
long between loading the sample and inserting the Cartridge into the Reader,
insert a Cartridge that has already been run, apply too little sample to the
Cartridge, or not use the supplied Assay Tip from the kit Pouch, the flow detected
will not adhere to expected patterns and an error will be reported. In this way
each Cartridge assures appropriate operator technique. Prior to reporting a result,
the Reader software checks that the background signal (measured from areas
outside of the detection zone and internal standard zones) is not higher than a
predetermined value and that the total amount of fluorescence is above a
predefined value. If either of these parameters is not met, an error is reported.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
