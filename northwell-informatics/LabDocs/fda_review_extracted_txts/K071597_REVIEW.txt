L. Test Principle:
The AFP method is a homogeneous, sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based
in LOCI™ technology. The LOCI™ reagents include two synthetic bead reagents
and a biotinylated anti-AFP monoclonal antibody fragment. The first bead reagent
(Chemibeads) is coated with an anti-AFP monoclonal antibody and contains
chemiluminescent dye. The second bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with
streptavidin and contains a photosensitizer dye. Sample is incubated with
biotinylated antibody and Chemibeads to form bead-AFP-biotinylated antibody
sandwiches. Sensibeads are added and bind to the biotin to form bead-pair
immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen
from Sensibeads which diffused into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent
reaction. The resulting signal is measured at 612 nm and is a direct function of the
AFP concentration in the sample.
The LOCI™ 5 Calibrator is a liquid multi-analyte product containing AFP from
human cord serum.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility testing was conducted in accordance with the
CLSI/NCCLS Approved Guideline for User Evaluation of Precision
Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices EP5-A2. Samples (pooled serum,
pooled plasma, and controls) were measured in duplicate, two times per day
over 20 days. Repeatability, between-run, between day, and within-lab were
determined by the analysis of variance method. The repeatability and within-
lab data are presented below. Imprecision was less than 2.3% CV.

ng/mL to 891 ng/mL) on two different AFP Flex® reagent lots (with two
different calibrator lots). The %CV was less than 2.0%
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity of the reportable range (1.7 to 1014 ng/mL) and for the low end of
the assay range (1.6 to 178.2 ng/mL) was evaluated by comparing observed
vs. expected values using a series of equally spaced sample pools that were
prepared by a sequential mixing of a high spiked serum equivalent and low
serum equivalent of known concentrations. Linear regression analysis
demonstrated the following results:

Spiking recovery: A spiking recovery study was performed by adding known
amounts of AFP (WHO 72/225) to a human serum pool with baseline AFP
values of 1.5 ng/mL. The sample concentrations were measured and the
percent recovery ranged from 97.8% to 101.7% with a mean recovery of
100%.
Dilution recovery: A dilution recovery study was performed by diluting 2
plasma and 3 serum samples with AFP values from 93.2 ng/mL to 761.9
ng/mL with Reagent grade water. The samples were diluted 1:2, 1:5, 1:10 and
1:20 and assayed for recovery. The recoveries ranged from 98.0% to 112.3%
with a mean of 104.2%.

e. Analytical specificity:
i. Interference Studies: Interference testing was performed according to
CLSI Approved Guideline for Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry
EP7-A2, to determine the effect of various substances on the Dimension
Vista® AFP assay at two concentrations of AFP (~9.0 ng/mL and ~230
ng/mL). The following interferents were tested for their effect on test
samples and compared to a control sample without interferent; bias
exceeding 10% is considered interference: bilirubin (conjugated and
unconjugated, 60 mg/dL), hemoglobin (1000 mg/dL), Intralipid 3000
mg/dL, total protein (12 g/dL) and rheumatoid factor (500 IU/mL).
Acceptance criteria were met. Additionally, 41 potentially interfering
drugs were also assayed on serum samples containing 10 ng/mL AFP and
shown to exhibit minimal interference (<10%).
ii. Interference by chemotherapeutic reagents: Interference by common
chemotherapeutic reagents was evaluated on two AFP concentrations (10
ng/mL and 250 ng/mL). The results are shown below. The acceptance
criteria (bias <10%) were met.
Test Bias (%) Bias (%)

iii. HAMA: Interference by human anti-murine antibodies was evaluated
using three heterophilic human plasma samples containing HAMA and
two AFP concentrations (10 and 250 ng/mL). The percent bias was
calculated and shown to be less than -4.8%.
iv. Cross Reactivity: The following substances were evaluated for cross-
reactivity with the AFP method when present in serum in the amounts
indicated. Systematic inaccuracies (bias) due to these substances are less
than 10 % at an AFP concentration of 10 ng/mL and 240 ng/mL.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A split sample method comparison study was performed according to CLSI
document EP9-A2; “Guideline for Method Comparison and Bias Estimation
using Patient Samples.” A total of 317 serum samples spanning the assay
range (0.97 to 881 ng/mL) were evaluated on both the Dimension® Vista and
the Abbott AxSYM® AFP methods. A similar comparison using 84 samples
(range 1.6 – 842.9 ng/mL) was performed between the Dimension Vista®
AFP Method and the ADVIA Centaur® AFP method. Passing-Bablok non-
parametric linear regression of singlicate measurements yielded the following
statistics:
Comparative Method Slope Intercept ng/mL Correlation n
(95% CI) (95% CI) Coefficient
AxSYM® AFP 0.93 0.093 0.995 317
(0.912-0.938) (0.042-0.146)

b. Matrix comparison:
Serum is the sample type used.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
Not applicable.
b. Other clinical supportive data (when a .is not applicable):
A clinical evaluation was performed to assess the Dimension Vista® AFP
method for the purpose of obtaining FDA premarket clearance for monitoring
patients with non-seminomatous testicular cancer. Seventy (74) retrospective
serial serum sample sets (with a minimum of 3 blood draws for each patient)
with clinical data from men with testicular cancer were tested. Inclusion and
exclusion criteria for the samples were provided. Four patients were excluded
from statistical analysis when it was determined they did not meet the
inclusion criteria for non-seminomatous testicular cancer. Samples were
selected for age (range 1.1 year old to 53.7 years old; average age 30.8 years
old), ethnicity (specimens from African Americans were not evaluated in this
study), and stage of disease (stage I through IV).
A longitudinal analysis of serial draws from 70 patients was performed. All
patients were categorized as Active/Progressive, Responding, Stable, or No
Evidence of Disease (NED). Disease progression was determined by the
patient physician based on either or all of the following:
• Physical examination of clinical signs and symptoms, including
results of laboratory tests.

• Radiographic findings used in the assessment of cancer status
(CAT Scans, MRI, X-rays, or ultrasound images.
• Surgical procedures including needle aspirations and Orchiectomy.
The Reference Change Value (RCV) was used to determine if a significant
change in AFP occurred. For this calculation, the RCV for each assay (the
Dimension Vista AFP method and predicate) was derived by taking into
account the published biological variation for AFP and the total imprecision
RCV =2 1/2 *Z*(CV 2 +CV 2 ) 1/2
of the assay. The formula for this calculation is A I
, where Z is the z-score, CV is the analytical variation, and CV is the
A I
biological variation (Fraser, Callum G. Biological Variation: From Principles
to Practice, Washington, DC: AACC Press, 2001). The within-subject
biological variation (12%) was obtained from the literature (Trapé J, Botarges
JM, Porta F, Ricós C, Badal JM, Salinas R, Sala M, Roca A. Reference
change value for alpha-fetoprotein and its application in early detection of
hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with hepatic disease. Clin Chem
2003;49:1209-1211). The RCV for the Vista AFP method was calculated to
be 33.7% and that of the predicate to be 37.7%.
Per Visit analysis:
Changes in AFP concentrations and in disease status were analyzed on a per
visit basis. Patients were categorized as Active/Progressive, Responding,
Stable or No Evidence of Disease (NED) by the attending physician based on
the clinical information. All 70 patients were analyzed to determine the
change of disease status per sequential pair (n=244). The table below shows
the distribution of results when compared to the disease status:

Per Patient analysis:
Within each patient’s series, disease status was classified as “Progression”
and “No Progression” with “No Progression” consisting of responding, stable,
and no evidence of disease, and computed on a per patient basis according to
the theory presented in, “Analysis of repeated markers used to predict
progression of cancer”, by B. Emir, S. Wieand, John Q.S., and S. Cha,
Statistics in Medicine, 17, 2563-2578 (1998).
Efficacy is demonstrated when the sum of sensitivity and specificity is greater
than one. Non-parametric estimates for the 95% confidence intervals were
derived using a bootstrap resampling technique with 2000 iterations. For the
Dimension Vista AFP method, the bootstrap 95% CI was between 1.0062 and
1.2861 for the sum of Sensitivity and Specificity, and for the comparative
method the bootstrap 95% CI for the sum of Sensitivity and Specificity was
between 1.0444 and 1.3166.
Concordance between Dimension Vista AFP and predicate:
All specimens were analyzed for percent agreement between the two assays
using their RCVs. Results are shown below:
