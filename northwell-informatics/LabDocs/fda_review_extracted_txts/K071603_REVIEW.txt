L. Test Principle:
The CEA method is a homogeneous, sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based
on LOCI™ technology. The LOCI™ reagents include two synthetic bead reagents
and a biotinylated anti-CEA monoclonal antibody fragment. The first bead reagent
(Chemibeads) is coated with an anti-CEA monoclonal antibody and contains
chemiluminescent dye. The second bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with
streptavidin and contains a photosensitizer dye. Sample is incubated with
biotinylated antibody and Chemibeads to form bead-CEA-biotinylated antibody
sandwiches. Sensibeads are added and bind to the biotin to form bead-pair
immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen
from Sensibeads which diffused into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent
reaction. The resulting signal is measured at 612 nm and is a direct function of the
CEA concentration in the sample.
The LOCI™ 5 Calibrator is a liquid multi-analyte product containing CEA from
human tissue culture cells.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility testing was conducted in accordance with the
CLSI/NCCLS Approved Guideline for Evaluation of Precision Performance
of Quantitative Measurement Methods, EP5-A2. Samples (pooled serum,
pooled plasma, and controls) were measured in duplicate, two times per day
over 20 days. Repeatability, between-run, between day, and within-lab were
determined by the analysis of variance method. The repeatability and within-
lab data are presented below. Imprecision was less than 3.6% CV at all levels,
which was acceptable.

lots (with a single calibrator lot). The %CV was less than 3.3% at all levels
for both lots, which was acceptable.
Between-Lab/Instrument reproducibility was also evaluated at three different
laboratories (New York, Glasgow Scotland and Maryland) on three different
instruments using 2 - 3 levels of quality control materials representing the
range of the assay (2 ng/mL to 240 ng/mL) on 2 different CEA Flex® reagent
lots and two calibrator lots). The %CV was less than 3.4% at all levels, which
was acceptable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity of the reportable range (1.3 – 1207.8 ng/mL) was evaluated by
comparing observed vs. expected values using a serially diluted sample pool
mixture. Linear regression analysis demonstrated the following results:
Range Slope Intercept ng/mL Correlation n
(ng/mL) Coefficient
1.3 – 1207.8 0.98 15.35 0.999 7
The acceptance criteria of slope between 0.9 and 1.1 and correlation
coefficient > 0.95 were met.
Spiking recovery: A spiking recovery study was performed by adding known
amounts of CEA (~5, 15, 75, and 500 ng/mL) to a human serum pool with a
baseline CEA value of 3.4 ng/mL. The sample concentrations were measured
and the percent recovery ranged from 94.0% to 100.4% with a mean recovery
of 97.1%.
Dilution recovery: A dilution recovery study was performed by diluting 5
serum samples with CEA values from 157.5 ng/mL to 751.5 ng/mL with
Reagent grade water. The samples were diluted 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, and 1:10
and assayed for recovery. The recoveries ranged from 98.0% to 109% with a
mean of 102.9%.
Antigen Excess (Hook Effect): The effect of antigen excess was evaluated
using a serum sample above the assay range. The CEA method generated
signal high enough to trigger the Above Assay Range flag and thus did not
hook back to generate falsely low value with CEA up to 225,000 ng/mL. The
declared analytical measurement range for this assay is 0.2 – 1000.0 ng/mL.
The data provided in the submission and summarized above support this
choice of measurement range.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
No information provided on traceability to any reference standard. The
predicate device, Beckman Coulter™ Access® CEA is used to assign values
to the Dimension Vista CEA calibrators.
Calibrator stability claims in the IFU were supported by stability protocols

and data.
Specimen stability claims were supported by protocols employing freeze-thaw
and stress testing up to 7 days at 4°C or stored at -20°C and -70oC for 30 days.
Results were within 7% of the control sample demonstrating that the specimen
was stable at recommended temperatures.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and the Limit of Detection (LoD) were evaluated
according to CLSI EP17-A “Protocols for Determination of Limits of
Detection and Limits of Quantitation.” The LoD defined as the lowest
concentration that can be detected reliably) was determined to be 0.2 ng/mL
with proportions of false positives (α) less than 5% and false negatives (β) less
than 5%; based on 15 determinations, with 4 blank and 4 low level samples.
The LoB is the highest concentration that is likely to be observed for a blank
sample and was determined to be 0.12 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Interference Studies: Interference testing was performed according to
CLSI Approved Guideline for Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry
EP7-A2, to determine the effect of various substances on the Dimension
Vista® CEA assay at two concentrations of CEA (5 ng/mL and 500
ng/mL). The following interferents were tested for their effect on test
samples and compared to a control sample without interferent; bias
exceeding 10% was considered interference: bilirubin (conjugated and
unconjugated, 60 mg/dL), hemoglobin (1000 mg/dL), Intralipid 3000
mg/dL, albumin (6 g/dL), total protein (8 g/dL), urea (500 mg/dL), uric
acid (20 mg/dL) and rheumatoid factor (500 IU/mL). Acceptance criteria
were met. Additionally, 53 potentially interfering drugs were also assayed
on serum and plasma samples containing 1.3 and 541 ng/mL CEA and
shown to exhibit minimal interference (<10%).
ii. HAMA: Interference by human anti-murine antibodies was evaluated by
mixing a sample with a high CEA level into three different heterophilic
human samples containing HAMA and comparing the results to the CEA
specimen before mixing. The percent bias at 500 ng/mL CEA was
calculated and shown to be less than -8.9% which meets the acceptance
criteria of 10%. The standard limitation for possible interference from
heterophilic antibodies is included in the package insert.
iii. Cross Reactivity: NCA (nonspecific crossreactive antigen) and NCA-2
were evaluated for cross-reactivity with the CEA method when present in
serum in the amounts indicated. Systematic inaccuracies (bias) due to
these substances are less than 10 % at a CEA concentration of 5 ng/mL.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A split serum sample method comparison study was performed according to
CLSI document EP9-A2; “Guideline for Method Comparison and Bias
Estimation using Patient Samples.” A total of 141 serum samples spanning
the assay range (0.8 to 974.0 ng/mL) were evaluated on both the Dimension®
Vista and the Beckman Coulter™ Access® methods. Linear regression of
singlicate measurements yielded the following statistics:
Comparative n CEA concentration range Slope Intercept Correlation
Method ng/mL [µg/L] ng/mL [µg/L] Coefficient
141 0.8-974 1.01 9.01 0.989
ACCESS® CEA
46 0.8-17.1 1.04 0.44 0.970
b. Matrix comparison:
Recommended sample types are serum and plasma (lithium and sodium
heparin). A matched sample method comparison study was performed. A
total of 54 paired serum and plasma samples spanning the assay range (1.2 to
992.6 ng/mL) were evaluated on the Dimension® Vista System. Linear
regression of singlicate measurements yielded the following statistics:
Sample Comparison Slope Intercept Correlation N
ng/mL [µg/L] Coefficient
Lithium heparin vs. 1.00 1.45 0.997 54
Serum
Sodium heparin vs. 0.99 2.55 0.998 54
serum
No clinically significant difference was observed between serum and plasma samples.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
Not applicable.
b. Other clinical supportive data (when a .is not applicable):
A clinical evaluation was performed to assess the Dimension Vista® CEA
method for the purpose of obtaining FDA premarket clearance for monitoring
cancer patients. Seventy-five (75) retrospective serial serum sample sets (with
a minimum of 3 blood draws for each patient) with colorectal cancer clinical
data were tested. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the samples were
provided. One patient was excluded from statistical analysis when it was
determined that they did not meet the protocol inclusion criteria. Samples
were characterized by sex, age (range 36.1 year old to 86.2 years old; average
age 63 years old), ethnicity, smoking history, treatment, and stage of disease
(stage I through IV).

A longitudinal analysis of serial draws from 74 patients was performed. All
patients were categorized as Active/Progressive, Responding, Stable, or No
Evidence of Disease (NED). Disease progression was determined by the
patient physician based on either or all of the following:
• Physical examination of clinical signs and symptoms, including
results of laboratory tests.
• Radiographic findings used in the assessment of cancer status
(CAT Scans, MRI, X-rays, or colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy or
ultrasound images.
• Surgical procedures including biopsy, esophagogastroduoden-
oscopy, laparotomy or resection.
The Reference Change Value (RCV) was used to determine if a significant
change in CEA occurred. For this calculation, the RCV for each assay (the
Dimension Vista CEA method and predicate) was derived by taking into
account the published biological variation for CEA and the total imprecision
1/2 2 2 1/2
RCV =2 *Z*(CV +CV )
of the assay. The formula for this calculation is A I
, where Z is the z-score, CV is the analytical variation, and CV is the
A I
biological variation (Fraser, Callum G. Biological Variation: From Principles
to Practice, Washington, DC: AACC Press, 2001). The within-subject
biological variation (12.7%) was obtained from the literature (Ricos C,
Alvarez V, Cava F, Garcia-Lario JV, Hernandez A, Jimenez CV, Minchinela
J, Perich C, Simon M. "Current databases on biologic variation: pros, cons
and progress." Scand J Clin Lab Invest 1999;59:491-500) and used for both
the new assay and the predicate. The RCV for the Vista CEA method was
calculated to be 36.2% and that of the predicate to be 36.7%.
Per Visit analysis:
Changes in CEA concentrations and in disease status were analyzed on a per
visit basis. Patients were categorized as Active/Progressive, Responding,
Stable or No Evidence of Disease (NED) by the attending physician based on
the clinical information. All 74 patients were analyzed to determine the
change of disease status per sequential pair (n=217). The table below shows
the distribution of results when compared to the disease status:

The per visit concordances were pooled by taking the correlation structure
within each patient series into consideration as recommended by B. Emir, S.
Wieand, John Q.S., and S. Cha, Statistics in Medicine, 17, 2563-2578 (1998).
Efficacy is demonstrated when the sum of sensitivity and specificity is
greater than one. Non-parametric estimates for the 95% confidence intervals
were derived using a bootstrap resampling technique with 2000 iterations. For
the Dimension Vista CEA method the bootstrap 95% CI was 1.2416 to 1.5227
for the sum of Sensitivity + Specificity, and for the comparative method the
bootstrap 95% CI for the sum of the Sensitivity + Specificity was 1.2180 to
1.4771. This demonstrated that both tests are effective.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The distribution of CEA values was determined using the Dimension Vista
System in 347 specimens from normal individuals (smokers and non-smokers)
and patients with colorectal cancer. In this study 96.4% of the healthy subjects
had CEA levels less than 5.0 ng/mL.
Expected Values: Non- smokers: 0.0 – 3.0 ng/mL [µg/L]
Smokers: 0.0 – 5.0 ng/mL [µg/L]
The expected values were calculated non-parametrically and represent results determined
from a population of healthy adults (n= 347); 198 (96%) non-smokers and 149 (96.6 %)
smokers).
