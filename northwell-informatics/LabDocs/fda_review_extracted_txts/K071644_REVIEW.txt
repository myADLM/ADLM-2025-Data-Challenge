Policy http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/oivd/guidance/950.html
L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on the kinetic interaction of microparticles in a solution (KIMS).
Phenobarbital antibody is covalently coupled to microparticles and the drug
derivative is linked to a macromolecule. The kinetic interaction of microparticles in
solutions is induced by binding of drug-conjugate to the antibody on the
microparticles and is inhibited by the presence of phenobarbital in the sample. A
competitive reaction takes place between the drug conjugate and phenobarbital in the
serum sample for binding to the phenobarbital antibody on the microparticles. The
resulting kinetic interaction of microparticles is indirectly proportional to the amount
of drug present in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All of the performance characteristics for this submission were conducted on the
Roche Hitachi 917.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision was conducted by running three levels of control (low,
mid and high controls) and two levels of human serum pools (low and high)
21 times on the Hitachi 917. The sponsor acceptance criteria for an observed
within run precision no greater than a standard deviation of 0.75, up to a

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was assessed via an 11-level dilution series that were prepared using
a phenobarbital spiked human serum pool diluted with a non-spiked serum
pool on the Hitachi 917. Recovery was determined by comparison of the
measured value to the theoretical value. The theoretical values were
calculated according to the dilution factors. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria
were recovery within +/-10% recovery or less than 1.7 μg/mL difference
between the observed and theoretical concentrations up to 60 μg/mL. The
samples were measured in triplicate. The recoveries for the lower assay range

were 89.39% to 113.75% for samples at 2.44 μg/mL to 2.67 μg/mL. The
recoveries were 91.3% to 104.8% from for samples ranging from 7.5 μg/mL
to 72.9 μg/mL.
The sponsor conducted a sample dilution study with the calibrator A diluent
that is recommended in the package insert. The samples (55.95- 10.97
ug/mL) were diluted in a 1:1 ratio and the diluted sample value was multiplied
by two and compared to the pre-diluted sample value. The recovery results
ranged from 95 to 104%. The assay range for the ONLINE TDM
phenobarbital assay is 2.4 - 60 μg/mL. The sponsor’s recovery acceptance
criterion is +/- 10%. The package insert instructs the users to manually dilute
samples that fall outside the assay range.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The already cleared Preciset TDM I Calibrators (k031856) are prepared to
contain known quantities of phenobarbital in normal human serum and are
traceable to USP reference standards. These calibrators are used to establish a
standard curve from which the quantity of unknown specimens can be
determined. The previously cleared Preciset TDM calibrators are not included
with the device but are suggested in the package insert.
d. Detection limit:
To determine the lower detection limit (LDL), twenty one replicates of the
zero calibrator and five replicates of calibrator b (5.0 μg/mL) were assayed in
a single run on the Hitachi 917 The observed LDL with zero calibrator is 0.15
μg/mL at 2 SD. The LDL was within the sponsor’s acceptable limits of less
than 1.7 μg/mL.
To determine the functional sensitivity, 7 clinical samples having
concentrations between zero and twice the LDL were assayed in triplicate
daily for ten days on the same instrument on the Hitachi 917 The acceptance
criterion for functional sensitivity was calculated as the lowest concentration
from clinical samples with a CV of less than 20%. The observed functional
sensitivity on the Hitachi 917 is 1.44 μg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor tested common substances and biological materials for
interference with the phenobarbital assay at a concentration of 15 μg/mL in
drug positive samples on the Hitachi 917. Spiked samples containing the
interferent substances were run in triplicates in a recovery study. The sponsor
states that there were no deviations from the expected results and all drug
interferences passed with 10% of the referenced values.

Cross-reactivity was assessed by spiking cross-reactants into serum pools that
contained approximately 15 μg/mL phenobarbital. The sponsor definitions
are:
Cross- If Da-Dt < LDL claim, then ND (Not Detectable) If Da-Dt > LDL
reactivity claim, then the cross-reactivity is calculated as follows:
equation
% Cross-Reactivity = [(Da-Dt)/ C] x 100
Dt = Concentration of Control Analyte Spike in serum Da =
Concentration of (Analyte + Cross-Reactant) C =
Concentration of Cross-Reactant
Cross reactivity was ND for all of the following compounds except
Butabarbital (0.15%), Mephobarbital (0.18%), Secobarbital (0.15%) and

The sponsor also conducted an interference study to evaluate the effects of
bilirubin, hemolysis, lipemia, triglycerides, total protein, HAMA, heterophilic
antibodies and rheumatoid factor with their phenobarbital assay on the Hitachi
917 The sponsor claims no interference with either assay as their recovery
results met their acceptance criteria of +/- 10% of the initial value. There was
no significant interference for conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin up to 66
mg/dL, hemolysis up to 1000 mg/dL, lipemia up to 600, triglycerides up to
1000 mg/dL, proteins between 2-14 g/dL, no HAMA interference and
rheumatoid factors up to 200 IU/mL.

“The therapeutic range of phenobarbital is correlated with seizure control as well
as the absence of toxic effects, and is generally accepted to be between 10 and 30
ug/mL. Variation in metabolism and absorption of the drug may cause levels to
rise above 40 μg/mL or fall below 15 μg/mL. The most frequent dose-related side
effect is sedation, to which a tolerance usually develops. Phenobarbital serum
levels above 40 μg/mL are often associated with nystagmus, atazia and dysarthria.
At high doses, phenobarbital can even cause an increase in seizure frequency.
Each laboratory should investigate the transferability of the expected values to its
own patient population and if necessary determine its own reference ranges.”
