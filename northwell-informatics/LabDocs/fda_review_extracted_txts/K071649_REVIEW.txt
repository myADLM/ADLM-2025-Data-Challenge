4. Special instrument requirements:
The Neonatal Total Galactose kit requires a fluorometer capable of measuring
fluorescence using excitation central wavelength of 340 nm (or 320 nm) and
emission central wavelength of 405 nm on 96 well microtiter plates.
Performance characteristics were determined using the PerkinElmer 1420 Victor
D fluorometer.
I. Device Description:
Each Neonatal Total Galactose kit contains reagents for either 960 assays or 4800
assays. The kit contains the following components:
Galactose calibrators and controls- Prepared from washed human blood, with
preservative, adjusted to a hematocrit of 55% and spotted onto Whatman 903
specimen collection paper.
The six calibrators contain galactose at the following concentrations:
A 0 mg/dL D 9.0 mg/dL
B 1.5 mg/dL E 18 mg/dL
C 4.0 mg/dL F 40 mg/dL
The two Normal and Abnormal Controls contain galactose and galactose-1-phosphate
at approximately 190 µmol/L blood (3.5 mg/dL) and 530 µmol/L blood (9.5 mg/dL)
respectively.
All human source materials used in the preparation of kit components was tested and
found to be non-reactive for the presence of HBsAg, anti-HIV 1 and 2, and HCV by
FDA approved methods.

L. Test Principle:
The Neonatal Total Galactose assay measures total galactose, i.e. both galactose and
galactose-1-phosphate, using a fluorescent galactose oxidase method. The
fluorescence is measured using excitation central wavelength of 340 nm (or 320 nm)
and emission central wavelength of 405 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Two studies were performed to evaluate precision of the Neonatal Total
Galactose test. Samples were prepared from adult human whole blood spiked
with different concentrations of galactose. The samples were then dispensed
onto filter paper and dried at room temperature overnight. Since the testing
was performed using dried blood spots, the extraction procedure was captured

In study 1, three levels of spiked dried blood samples were assayed in
replicates of four in 18 runs over 6 days. The testing was conducted using
three kit lots, two fluorometers, and three operators. The total number of
replicates was n=144. The results are summarized in the table below.

In study 2, four levels of spiked dried blood samples were assayed in

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The study was performed following the CLSI protocol EP6-A. Whole blood
heparinized sample pools were spiked with analyte to create samples with
high concentrations of galactose and galactose-1-phosphate. The high samples
were mixed in varying proportions with the sample pools containing very low
galactose to create a dilution series. Each test sample was spotted on filter
paper in quadruplicate (n=4), dried overnight, and tested.
The data was analyzed using linear regression as well as second and third
order non-linear fitted polynomial regression. The second order model fit the
data better than the linear model. However, for all dilution points the relative
differences between the two models were within the sponsor’s defined
acceptance criterion of +/- 25%. The results are summarized below.

The maximum observed percent difference (–17 %) between the models was
seen with the undiluted low level sample which is near the limit of detection
of the test. The relative differences (%) of all other dilutions points were
within ± 5 %. Therefore, the Neonatal Total Galactose kit is linear in the range
1.3 mg/dL to approximately 56 mg/dL.
The values of the highest kit calibrator may vary slightly but does not exceed
56 mg/dL. The package insert states that samples with values above the
highest calibrator are not accurate and should be reported as presumptive
positives.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The kit calibrators are traceable to a validated HPLC-MS/MS method. Six
dried blood spot calibrators and two dried blood spot controls, normal and
abnormal, are provided with the kit. Real-time stability including shelf-life,
transport, and in-use stability studies for the entire kit are performed,
including the controls and calibrators. Additionally, accelerated stability
studies are also performed separately for the kit calibrators and controls. The
study protocols and statistically calculated acceptance limits were reviewed
and found to be acceptable.

d. Detection limit:
The sponsor states that the limit of blank (LoB) study was performed in
accordance with the recommendations of CLSI EP-17. The LoB was
calculated from data using two kit lots over five testing days and a total of 100
measurements of the zero calibrator. Calibrators and controls were tested in
duplicate for each assay. Since the assay does not report values less than zero,
the LoB was estimated non-parametrically, as CLSI EP-17 advises, as the 95th
percentile of the measurements. The limit of blank was observed to be 0.7
mg/mL.
To estimate the limit of detection (LoD), five samples with low levels of
galactose were also assayed in the same study for a total of 100 measurements
at each level. These samples were prepared from heparinized whole blood
with added galactose and galactose-1-phosphate, spotted onto filter paper, and
dried. Statistical analysis yielded a limit of detection of 1.3 mg/dL.
The package insert states that values below 1.3 mg/dL should be reported as
“<1.3 mg/dL.”
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference from elevated lipid, bilirubin, and hemoglobin was evaluated at a
galactose concentration of approximately 10 mg/dL. The sponsor used a two
sample t-test at the 95% confidence interval to evaluate the significance of any
difference seen between test and control samples.
Bilirubin at concentrations ranging from 10-40 mg/dL, hemoglobin at 20 and
25 g/dL, and Intralipid at concentrations ranging from 0.25-1.0 g/dL were
separately was added to whole blood specimens containing galactose, spotted
onto filter paper, dried, and tested. Specimens without added interferant were
also tested. Specimens containing the highest levels of bilirubin and
hemoglobin did not interfere with the galactose test using the sponsor’s
acceptance criteria. Conversely, specimens containing lipid interfered with the
accurate measurement of galactose across all levels tested and resulted in an
over-recovery of galactose up to 30%. This observation is likely due to the
physical nature of lipid in that it interferes with the transmission of light. The
results are summarized in the package insert.
The following substances were tested and found not to interfere at the levels
stated: glucose (1200 mg/dL), mannose (1–10 mg/dL), fructose (25 mg/dL),
ascorbate (0.1–3 mg/dL), protein BSA (12 g/dL), and acetaminophen (0.1–1
mg/dL). Glutathione at concentrations up to 6 mg/dL did not interfere,
however a concentration of 60 mg/dL, which far exceeds the expected
concentration in newborns, caused under-recovery of approximately 40%.
This is likely due to glutathione’s chemical properties and interference in the
assay’s enzymatic reaction. The results are summarized in the package insert.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 2109 specimens from newborns were obtained prospectively from a
state public health laboratory’s routine newborn screening program.
Additionally, seven (7) specimens were also tested that were retrospective
high galactose samples of which three (3) were from newborns with
diagnosed galactosemia. Dried blood spots were assayed using the Perkin
Elmer total galactose kit and a commercially available comparator method.
The presumptive positive cut-off was determined from the results using each
kit’s 95th and 99th percentiles. For the Perkin Elmer kit these values were 5.1
mg/dL and 8.3 mg/dL respectively, while the values for the comparator
method were 4.2 mg/dL and 9.4 mg/dL, respectively. The results are
summarized in the tables below.
