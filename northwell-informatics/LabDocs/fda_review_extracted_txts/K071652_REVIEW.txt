L. Test Principle:
The HemoCue WBC System consists of the HemoCue WBC Analyzer together with
specially designed microcuvettes, HemoCue WBC Microcuvettes. The microcuvette
(single-use only) serves both as a sample container and a reaction chamber. A blood
sample of approximately 10 µL is drawn into the cavity by capillary action. A
hemolysing agent lyses the red cells in the microcuvette and a staining agent colors the
white blood cells. An image is taken of the stained white blood cells and the number of
cells is counted by image analysis. The result is presented within 3 minutes on the
analyzer’s display.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-Run and Total precision was determined using four HemoCue WBC
Microcuvette batches and five HemoCue Analyzers. Commercially available controls
at three different levels were used. The WBC count concentration was measured in
duplicate twice a day, during 20 consecutive days. Additionally, a study was
performed using fresh blood samples. The study was performed on venous whole
blood samples run in duplicate. The results are as follows:
Precision study with control material:
Evaluated levels n Within – run Total
2.5 x 109/L 400 4.1 % 5.4 %
7.2 x 109/L 400 2.9 % 3.5 %
19 x 109/L 400 1.6 % 1.9 %
Precision study with patient sample material:
Evaluated levels n Total
0.3-1.0 x 109/L 12 10.4 %
1.1-3.5 x 109/L 52 4.1 %
3.6-10 x 109/L 209 3.5 %
10.1-20 x 109/L 88 2.5 %
20.1-30x 109/L 35 2.2 %
Total 396 3.2
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Nine different WBC levels were prepared from a whole blood sample and a buffy
coat. All levels were analyzed with five replicates on five HemoCue WBC systems.
The evaluation of seven levels determined that the HemoCue WBC system is linear
between 0.3 – 30.0 x 109/L (=0.3 x103/µL)
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Microcuvette Stability (Open Vial): Stability testing was performed using whole
blood samples with a WBC concentration of 4-10 x 10 9/L on three batches. The vials
were opened ten times during the testing period. Four microcuvettes per storage
condition were taken out and analyzed on three different analyzers. The open vial
stability has been verified for three months when stored at 15 – 35oC (59-95o F),
<90% condensing humidity.
.
Whole Blood: Stability testing was performed on six different venous blood samples
with low (3-4x 109/L), normal (5-10x 109/L) and high WBC levels (>13x 109/L). The

samples were analyzed initially, after 24 hours and after 48 hours. The samples were
stored in room temperature and refrigerator, respectively. The results confirmed that
specimens are stable 48 hours, both in refrigerator and room temperature.
d. Detection limit:
Functional Sensitivity (FS) is estimated as the mean concentration for a spiked
sample whose CV is 20%. The FS has been determined to be 0.3 x109/L
e. Analytical specificity:
Not applicable.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
396 venous specimens were analyzed in duplicate at four sites for the HemoCue
System and Sysmex 1000i. Total mean difference was 0.5% and the correlation
between methods was r2 = 0.992.
111 venous specimens were collected from two sites and analyzed on both the
HemoCue WBC system and the manual light microscope WBC method. The
HemoCue WBC fulfilled the accuracy, precision and outlier acceptance criteria. The
correlation was between the methods was r2 = 0.992.
b. Matrix comparison:
Capillary whole blood was collected in EDTA Microtainer tube from 68 donors.
Venous whole blood was collected in EDTA Vacutainer tubes from 28 of the same 68
donors. The capillary whole blood was analyzed in parallel on HemoCue WBC
system and Sysmex XS-1000i. The venous whole blood was analyzed in parallel on
The HemoCue WBC system and Sysmex XS-1000i. It was concluded that there is no
statistical difference between the systems when analyzing venous and capillary
samples.

1. Modes of Operation:
Random access: The microcuvettes serve as sample container and a reaction chamber.
2. Software:
The HemoCue WBC Analyzer performs the WBC count by taking an image of the
stained cells, and then counting them using a specially designed algorithm. The results
are presented for the user on a display. Additionally, the user may attach a printer. The
software application embedded in the analyzer provides the full functionality of the
device. This software handles and controls the following: User Interface, Measuring
hardware, Measuring algorithm, Communication via a RS232 interface (i.e. printer).

this line of product types:
Yes _X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Manual recording of specimen identification is required.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Capillary Blood sampling is performed by a fingertip puncture and applied directly to
the HemoCue WBC Microcuvette.
Venous Blood should be sampled at room temperature (15-35oC). If refrigerated (2-8oC,
can be stored for 48 hours) allow to warm to room temperature. Sample tubes should be
mixed thoroughly on a mechanical mixer for at least 2 minutes or inverted 8-10 times by
hand. A drop of blood should be placed on a hydrophobic plastic or glass slide using a
pipette or other suitable transfer device. The HemoCue WBC Microcuvette should be
filled in on continuous process from this drop of blood.
5. Calibration:
The system was designed and developed to establish agreement with manual light
microscopy method for WBC count. The system is factory calibrated and needs no
further calibration.
6. Quality Control:
The HemoCue WBC Analyzer has an internal quality control, the “self-test.” Every time
the analyzer is turned on, it will automatically verify the measurement performance. If
additional quality control is required for regulatory reason, it is recommended to contact
HemoCue, Inc. or the local distributor for current recommendations of suitable control
material.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Interference studies were preformed taking sample abnormalities, drugs, metabolites, sample
additives and dietary substances into consideration. A list of substances were tested and
found not to interfere. This list is included in the labeling (with highest concentration or
percentages tested). Nucleated RBCs was the only condition that may interfere to cause the
results to be falsely high.

R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
