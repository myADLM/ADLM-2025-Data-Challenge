confirmed by cell culture. Negative results do not preclude influenza virus
infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other clinical
management decisions.

L. Test Principle:
TRU FLU is a single use immunochromatographic assay that consists of a Conjugate
Tube, a Test Strip, and Sample Diluent. The Conjugate Tube contains a lyophilized bead
of colloidal gold-linked monoclonal antibodies to influenza A and influenza B (detector
antibodies). The Test Strip carries a nitrocellulose membrane with dried capture
antibodies at separate lines for influenza A and influenza B. The Test Strip holder caps
the Conjugate Tube during testing and subsequent disposal to reduce exposure to
potential pathogens. The conjugate bead is first rehydrated in the Conjugate Tube with
Sample Diluent, prior to the addition of patient specimen. The contents are mixed before
the Test Strip is added. As the test is incubated at 20-25ºC, influenza A or influenza B
antigens, if present in the diluted sample, bind to the corresponding monoclonal antibody-
colloidal gold conjugate as the sample moves up the Test Strip. The influenza A capture
monoclonal antibody is bound to the Test Strip at the test-FLU A position of the device.
When it binds the antigen-influenza A antibody-colloidal gold complex, it yields a visible
pink-red line. Similarly, the influenza B capture monoclonal antibody bound to the assay
membrane at the test-FLU B position will result in a pink-red line when it captures
antigen-influenza B antibody-colloidal gold complexes. When no antigen is present, no
complexes are formed and no pink-red line will appear at either the test FLU A or the test
FLU B position of the Test Strip. An internal control line helps determine whether
adequate flow has occurred through the Test Strip during a test run. A visible pink-red
line at the Control position of the Test Strip should be present each time a specimen or
control is tested. If no pink-red control line is seen, the test is considered invalid.

Assay precision, intra-assay variability and inter-assay variability were assessed with a
reference panel prepared from pools of negative samples spiked with specific virus. The
reproducibility panel consisted of high positive (n = 2), low negative (n = 1), and low
positive (n = 4) and high negative specimens (n =4). The latter were prepared near the
assay limit of sensitivity. Each reference specimen was coded to prevent its identification
during testing. Each was evaluated twice per day for three consecutive days by three
different laboratories. High negative samples (viral load just below LOD) produced weakly
positive results in 8 out of 72 high negative replicate tests performed with the samples
prepared near the cutoff (See EP12-A, User protocol for evaluation of qualitative
performance; approved guideline; NCCLS/CLSI, Vol. 22, no.14, 2002.) Low positive
samples (viral concentration near the LOD) produced 1 negative result in 72 replicate tests.
The high positive and low negative samples produced correct results 100% of the time.

c. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity was assessed using two-fold serial dilutions of selected
influenza A and influenza B virus stocks. The organisms tested are listed in the Table
below. The sensitivity was the highest dilution that produced a definitive positive
reaction.

Influenza B/Lee/40 B 1.7 X 104
d. Analytical specificity:
The specificity of TRU FLU was tested utilizing the following bacterial, viral and yeast
strains. Positive and negative respiratory specimens were spiked with ≥ 4 x 107/mL
bacteria or yeast. Virus inoculations were performed at ≥ 6.7 X 104 TCID /mL. None
50
of the microorganisms tested yielded a positive result with the influenza-negative
samples or interfered with detection of the influenza A and/or B positive samples. Both
the negative and positive respiratory samples were positive when spiked with influenza A
strain VR-100 or influenza B strain VR-295.

Clinical sensitivity:
Nine independent laboratories and the manufacturer, (located in distinct geographic
regions), evaluated TRU FLU in parallel with tissue culture. Six hundred and ninety
seven fresh and 63 frozen samples, collected prospectively during the 2006-7 influenza
season were tested. In the case of frozen samples tissue culture tests were performed
while they were fresh and before they were frozen. Twenty seven percent (185/697) of
the prospective samples were from patients 22 years of age or older, 64% (447/697) from
patients 12 years of age or less and 8% (59/697) from patients 13 to 21 years of age. The
age of six patients donating samples was not recorded. Of the 63 samples tested only in
the frozen state, the majority (33/63 or 52%) were from patients aged 2 months to 2
years. The patient ages for the remaining retrospective samples were 14% (9/63) for
patients aged 1 month or less, 22% (14/63) for patients aged 3-12 years, and 11% (7/63)
for patients aged 13-21 years. Fifty three percent of the prospective and 51%
retrospective samples were from males while 47% prospective and 49% retrospective
samples were from females. The gender of five patients donating samples was not
recorded. No differences in performance were observed based on patient gender or
patient age. The results of trials based on sample type are given in Tables 2-4. Of the

697 prospective samples tested, 11 were not classified with respect to sample type and 1
produced invalid culture results. These 12 samples were excluded from the calculations.
