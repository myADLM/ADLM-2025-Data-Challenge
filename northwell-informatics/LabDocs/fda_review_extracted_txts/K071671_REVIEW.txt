510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
K071671
B. Purpose for Submission:
Marketing product in the U.S.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Aperio Technologies, Inc.
ScanScope® XT System, IHC HER2/neu Manual Read of Digital Slide Application
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Manual interpretation of digital images for immunohistochemistry Her2/neu stained
slides
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The ScanScope® XT System is an automated digital slide creation, management,
viewing and analysis system which consists of an automated digital microscope
slide scanner, computer, color monitor, keyboard and digital pathology
information management software and image analysis software. For this
particular application slides are scanned and a digital image is generated that the
pathologist may use for semi-quantitative assessment of HER2
immunohistochemistry stained histological specimens. This assessment may be
performed without use of the image analysis software and the system software
makes no independent interpretations of the data.
2. Principles of Operation:
The ScanScope® XT System is intended to provide digital images to the
pathologist to supplement the semi-quantitative interpretation of
immunohistochemistry Her2/neu stained breast cancer specimens. Formalin-
fixed, paraffin embedded breast cancer specimens are stained with the Dako
Hercep Test™ according to the package insert. Slides are then scanned and
digitized at high resolution using the ScanScope XT digital slide scanner. The
pathologist manually reads and interprets the digital image without use of image

analysis software. The HER2 score is calculated by the pathologist based on the
percentages of 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+ cells according to the HER2 scoring scheme in
the Dako Hercep Test™ product insert.
3. Modes of Operation:
Computer-assisted interpretation.
4. Specimen Identification:
Specimens are identified by slide label (a digital image is taken of the slide label
and stored with the digital slide) or by barcode, if provided by the user’s
laboratory information system.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Immunohistochemical stained microslides can be loaded in the ScanScope XT
manually (one at a time) or automatically. The ScanScope XT can automatically
scan 120 slides contained in slide racks.
6. Calibration:
Calibration of the ScanScope XT is an automated process which is re-verified as
part of the scanning process for every scanned slide. If the calibration is not
within predefined limits, then the user is prevented from scanning the slide and
must take steps to assure that the scan is within acceptable limits.
When the user scans a slide, the controller software automatically performs a
“prescan”. The prescan is a scan of a small region of the slide which contains
clear glass or “white space”. The brightness and color characteristics of the image
are used to correct the resulting scanned image. The main functions of the
prescan process are to automatically verify that no significant tissue is present,
flatten the illumination field, correct the white balance, and measure bulb
brightness.
7. Quality Control:
The accuracy of the system depends on the laboratory following the quality
control instructions recommended in the labeling of the Dako Hercep™ Test kit.
8. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and Software Development
processes for this line of product types:

J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy (Comparison to Manual Method):
The substantial equivalence study was based on comparison of manual reads of the
digital slide to conventional manual microscopy.
A multi-site study was conducted at two clinical sites to compare the performance of
Aperio’s IHC HER2 Manual read of digital slides to manual microscopy. 180 formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded breast tissue specimens immunohistochemically stained using
Dako’s HerceptTest™were used for this study; 80 specimens with approximately equal
HER2 score distribution from site 1, and 100 routine specimens from site 2. At each site,
three pathologists performed a blinded read of the glass slides using a microscope and
reported the HER2 score for each of the slides. The glass slides were scanned at Aperio
using a different ScanScope for each site, and after a wash-out period of over one week
and randomization of the slides, the same three pathologists remotely viewed the digital
slides on a computer monitor, performed a blinded read and reported the HER2 score for
each of the slides.

agreements for manual microscopy 76.3% to 91.3% with confidence bounds from 65.4%
to 96.4%.
b. Precision:
The precision study was not done on the manual read of the digital slides but using
Aperio’s IHC HER2 image analysis algorithm. The image analysis algorithm detects and
quantifies the same cell features and uses the same scoring scheme as the pathologists
reading IHC HER2 slides, and was used to quantify objectively the variability of the
digital slides provided by the ScanScope systems.
Eight HER2 slides with two slides per HER2 score 0, 1+, 2+ and 3+were sampled from
one of the clinical sites to be used in a suite of precision studies. The slides were sampled

in sequential order using the rounded average score of the manual microscopy scores
provided by the three pathologists.
Separate studies were conducted to analyze the system introduced variability separately
from the variability introduced by the pathologists. Pathologist precision studies were
only performed to be able to put the system variability into perspective to the variability
introduced by the pathologists. The precision studies analyzed the changes in the system
response by extending the analysis of the HER2 score to the underlying cumulative
percentages of 3+, 2+ and 1+ cells on which the HER2 score calculations are based.
Cumulative percentages of 3+, 2+, and 1+ cells are defined as the percentages of 3+ cells,
3+ and 2+ cells and 3+, 2+ and 1+ cells. Only the accuracy of the HER2 scores was
evaluated in the Clinical Comparison to Manual Microscopy.
Intra-System
The eight HER2 slides were scanned 10 times on the same ScanScope system. The image
analysis results show perfect agreement (100%) for the calculated HER2 scores and an
overall average standard deviation of 0.69% (maximum 2.46%) and average range
(maximum – minimum) of 1.22% (maximum 7.14%) for the cumulative percentages of
3+, 2+ and 1+ cells (range from 0.0 to 100.0%) across all runs.
Inter-Day/Intra-System
The eight HER2 slides were scanned on the same ScanScope system over 20 times on
different days. The image analysis results show perfect agreement (100%) for the
calculated HER2 scores and an overall average standard deviation of 0.67% (maximum
2.43%) and average range of 1.68% (maximum 12.07%) for the cumulative percentages
of 3+, 2+ and 1+ cells across all runs.
Inter-System
The same eight HER2 slides were scanned 10 times on three different ScanScope
systems. The image analysis results show perfect agreement (100%) for the calculated
HER2 scores across all systems and all runs. The image analysis results on each of the
three ScanScope systems show an overall average standard deviation of 0.69%, 0.59%
and 0.57% (maximum 2.46%, 1.65%, 1.34%) and average range of 1.22%, 1.14% and
1.20% (maximum 7.14%, 5.09%, 4.70%) for the cumulative percentages of 3+, 2+ and
1+ cells respectively over all runs. The image analysis results of the three ScanScope
systems combined show an overall average standard deviation of 0.78% (maximum
2.41%) and average range of 1.93% (maximum 8.95%) respectively for the cumulative
percentages of 3+, 2+ and 1+ cells over all runs.
Intra-Pathologist
One pathologist read the same eight HER2 slides 5 times using manual microscopy and 5
times using a manual read of digital slides on a computer monitor while outlining as well
the tumor regions for analysis. Between reads, the pathologist respected a wash-out
period of over four days. The manual microscopy results show 2 outliers out of 40 scores
(5%) and the manual read of digital slides show 3 outliers out of 40 scores (7.5%).
Outliers are defined as scores that are different from the median values of the scores
provided by the pathologist over 5 runs of the method.

Three pathologists read the same eight HER2 slides using manual microscopy and using
a manual read of digital slides on a computer monitor while outlining as well the tumor
regions for analysis (used the data from the clinical comparison to manual microscopy
study). In comparison to their median scores, the manual microscopy results show 3
outliers out of 24 scores (12.5%) and the manual read of digital slides results show 5
outliers out of 24 scores (21%). Outliers are defined as scores that are different from the
median values of the scores provided by the three pathologists in this study.
