L. Test Principle:
The TheraTest EL-tTG™ IgA/IgG or The TheraTest EL-Gliadin™ IgA/IgG Test
System is a solid phase enzyme immonoassay in a 96-well plate format for the
measurement of IgA and IgG antibodies against tissue transglutaminase or gliadin.
Wells are coated with human recombinant tissue transglutaminase or purified gliadin,
and incubated with Specimens, Calibrators, Positive and Negative Controls. During
the incubation, anti-tTG or anti-gliadin antibodies present in the test sample are
bound to the solid phase antigen. The wells are subsequently washed, and isotype-
specific horseradish-peroxidase labeled anti-human immunoglobulin antibody
(enzyme conjugate) is added. After incubating the wells with the enzyme conjugate,
unbound labeled antibody is removed by washing. A chromogenic substrate solution
is then added to the wells, and the presence of antibodies to tissue transglutaminase is
detected by a color change produced by the conversion of the substrate by the
enzyme. The reaction is stopped, and the intensity of the color, which is proportional
to the amount of the bound antibody, is read by an ELISA reader. The absorbance
value in the blank well (incubated with Specimen Diluent) is subtracted from the
values obtained with Specimens, Calibrators and Controls.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra-assay studies on anti-tTG IgA/IgG and anti-Gliadin IgA/IgG:
Three specimens (high, moderate and near cut-off) were assayed for a total of
20 times and two runs per day. The mean units for anti-tTG IgA ranged from
26 to 187 units and the mean units for anti-tTG IgG ranged from 29 to 83
units. The percent CV for anti-tTG IgA ranged from 2.8% – 10.9% and for
anti-tTG IgG, 2.9% – 5.3%. The mean units for anti-Gliadin IgA ranged from
29 to 154 units and the mean units for anti-Gliadin IgG ranged from 23 to 88
units. The percent CV for anti-Gliadin IgA ranged from 4.0% – 7.6% and for
anti-Gliadin IgG 2.4% – 10.8%.
Inter-assay studies on anti-tTG IgA/IgG and anti-Gliadin IgA/IgG:
Three specimens (high, moderate and near cut-off) were assayed for a total of
20 different times in one or two runs. The mean units for anti-tTG IgA ranged
from 30 to 193 units and for anti-tTG IgG ranged from 27 to 83 units. The
percent CV for anti-tTG IgA ranged from 3.9% – 10.1% and 7.8% – 10.7%

for anti-tTG IgG. The mean units for anti-Gliadin IgA ranged from 34 to 134
units and the mean units for anti-Gliadin IgG ranged from 29 to 65 units. The
percent CV for anti-Gliadin IgA ranged from 8.4% – 10.1% and 9.0% –
10.2% for anti-Gliadin IgG.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There are no reference standards for tTG and gliadin. The results are reported
in arbitrary units.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference by endogenous substances: No data provided. The package insert
states that grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, icteric or microbially contaminated
serum should not be used in this assay.
Crossreactivity with other autoantibodies: Testing was performed with 56 sera
consisting of 40 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and 16 thyroid disease.
The positive samples were: one IBD with anti-tTG IgA, one IBD with anti-
tTG IgG, two IBD with anti-gliadin IgA, one IBD with anti-gliadin IgG and
one thyroid disease with anti-gliadin IgG.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off value of >25 U/mL was established based on testing 100 blood
bank donors. There were 51 females and 49 males with a median age of 29
years and a range from 16 to 70 years. The race distribution was 14%
Hispanic, 8% Black, 4% Asian, and 74% other. The 98th percentile was used
to establish the upper limit of normal for IgA and IgG Anti-tTG and the 97.5th
and 94th percentile were used to establish for IgA and IgG Anti-gliadin
respectively.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Testing was performed on 106 samples (42 from IgA sufficient CD patients,
14 from IgA deficient patients and 50 healthy donors). The comparative study
on anti-tTG IgA had a 100% Positive Percent Agreement (40/40) (95% CI:
91%-100%); 97% Negative Percent Agreement (64/66) (95% CI: 89%-100%);
and 98% Overall Agreement (104/106) (95% CI: 93%-100%). Refer to table
