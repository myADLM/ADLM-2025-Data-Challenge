L. Test Principle:
This assay determines high density lipoprotein cholesterol through the accelerator
selective detergent methodology. This procedure measures HDL-cholesterol in a two
step reaction sequence. In the first step, non-HDL cholesterol is rendered non-reactive.
In the second step, HDL cholesterol is solubilized using a selective detergent and reacts
to produce a red chromogen. This method is based on accelerating the reaction of
cholesterol oxidase (CO) with non-HDL unesterified cholesterol and dissolving HDL
cholesterol selectively using a specific detergent. In the first reagent, non-HDL

unesterified cholesterol is subject to an enzyme reaction and the peroxide generated is
consumed by a peroxidase reaction with DSBmT yielding a colorless product. The
second reagent consists of a detergent (capable of solubilizing HDL cholesterol),
cholesterol esterase (CE), and chromagenic coupler to develop color for the quantitative
determination of HDL cholesterol.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Estimates of imprecision were determined through the replicate analysis of
two serum controls. The controls were assayed in triplicates in two
independently calibrated runs separated by at least three hours. The daily
protocol was repeated for a total of eight days using five Envoy 500 HDL
Cholesterol Reagent boats on a single Envoy 500 Analyzer. Average results
for the two controls were reported for every run. Estimates of within run and
total imprecision were calculated and are shown below. The level 1 results
from one of the runs were removed from the calculations.
Within Run Total
Sample n mean 1SD %CV 1SD %CV
Level 1 45 36.8 0.52 1.4% 0.72 2.0%
Level 2 48 71.1 0.68 1.0% 1.25 1.8%
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated by testing 12 samples with equally spaced HDL
concentrations ranging from 0 to over 170 mg/dL. The samples were
prepared by diluting a 3300 mg/dL human HDL Cholesterol concentrate with
analyte stripped serum. The standards were then analyzed on the ENVOY
500 analyzer across 4 independently calibrated runs and compared to their
dilution factors by least squares linear regression. The assay is linear across
the reportable range of 5 mg/dL to 150 mg/dL HDL cholesterol as shown by
mean regression residuals that are less than 1 mg/dL for all pools that describe
this range and a correlation coefficient of 0.9998.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability testing was performed by the manufacturer. The calibrators and
reagents are stable until the expiration date on the label when stored as
instructed.

On board stability was performed on the Envoy 500 analyzer demonstrated
that the calibrators and reagents are stable for 14 days when stored on board
the Envoy 500 analyzer.
Calibrator set points are assigned by the calibrator manufacturer and are
traceable to the CDC described reference method for the determination of
HDL cholesterol. These calibrators are not traceable to the Cholesterol
Reference Method Laboratory Network for HDL cholesterol results produced
using the Envoy 500 instrument application.
d. Detection limit:
A limit of quantitation (LoQ) study was conducted based on procedures
described in CLSI EP17-A. The limit of the blank (LoB) of 0.29 mg/dL and
limit of detection (LoD) of 0.46 mg/dL were calculated as described in the
CLSI document. The LoQ of 0.46 mg/dL was determined to be equal to the
LoD and was calculated assuming a zero method bias and an acceptable error
of 2 mg/dL. The LoQ is lower than the lower limit of usable range which is
set at 5 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The effects of potential interfering substances were tested by assaying spiked
serum pools. A serum pool with an HDL concentration of approximately 55
mg/dL was prepared from individual patient specimens and divided into
aliquots. All but one of the aliquots were spiked with interferants at the
concentrations shown below. The unspiked and spiked pools were tested
multiple times in a single analytical run on the Envoy 500. Substances that
affect results by more than 3 mg/dL compared to the interferant free sample
were reported as interfering substances in the package insert.
Interfering Substance Levels Tested
Ascorbic Acid 0, 0.75, 1.5, 2.25, 3.0 mg/dL
Ditaurobilirubin 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 mg/dL
RBC hemolysate 0, 40, 80, 120, 160, 200 mg/dL
Intralipid, 20% solution 0, 80, 160, 240, 320, 400 mg/dL
0, 400, 800, 1200, 1600, 2000 mg/dL
The ascorbic acid, ditaurobilirubin, and RBC hemolysate spiked samples all
had a bias of less than 3 mg/dL compared to the unspiked sample. The results
of triglyceride interference (performed with intralipid) resulted in the bias
shown below.
