K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI EP7-A Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry
L. Test Principle:
The microwells are pre-coated with immobilized antigens of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. An aliquot of either serum or fecal specimen is emulsified in the diluent.
The diluted specimen, the ready to use positive control, and the 1X diluent negative
control are transferred to the microwell. If ASCA are present in the specimen, they
will bind to the immobilized antigens. After incubation, the wells are washed and the
conjugate added. The conjugate binds to the ASCA captured by the immobilized
antigens. A second series of wash steps remove any unbound material. Following
the addition of the substrate, a color is detected spectrophotometrically due to the
enzyme-antibody-antigen complexes that form the presence of ASCA.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was done on a single wavelength spectrophotometer (OD ).
450
The intra-assay reproducibility was determined by testing 8 human serum
specimens (4 ASCA positive and 4 ASCA negative) 8 times in the same run.
The positive samples comprised of samples with varying concentrations of
ASCA. For the analysis, each serum was diluted 1:1000 with the kit diluent.
The OD data were reformatted to reflect the reportable result of the assay,
which would either be positive or negative. The table below summarizes the
OD output as well as the final call for each of the replicates.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
Sample dilution
The specimen dilution of 1:1000 was optimized using titrations (1:100 to
1:1000) of known ASCA-positive and ASCA-negative serum specimens. The
1:1000 dilution was then challenged using healthy control serum panel and
clinical specimens using 3 different OD cut-offs (0.110, 0.120 and 0.150).
450nm
The dilution and OD cut-off (1:1000 and ≥0.110) that provided the
450nm
highest range of correlations to Crohn’s disease was considered optimal. This
was further challenged in the clinical evaluations.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no recognized standard or reference material for ASCA. The
calibrator and positive control (confirmed ASCA positive) were prepared in-
house and the designated O.D. was assigned during development process.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference: Interference studies were performed as follows: Control samples
shown below were divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was mixed with
equal volumes of high ASCA-Ig-positive serum samples. The other aliquot
was mixed with equal volumes of ASCA Ig-negative samples. All samples
were tested seven times using ASCA CHEK. All ASCA-Ig-positive samples
remained positive and all ASCA Ig-negative samples remained negative. No
interference was observed.

450
≥0.110, 0.120 and 0.150 and OD (dual wavelength spectrophotometer) at
450/620
≥0.080 and 0.110 were evaluated.
Specimens were diluted at 1:1000 and tested by the ASCA-CHEK test for
ASCA Ig. The optimal cut-off that provided the best correlation to clinically
confirmed Crohn’s disease was determined. The OD cut-off of ≥0.110 at
OD and ≥0.080 at OD provided the largest number of samples that
450 450/620
correlated to Crohn’s disease. The following table shows the results for the

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 180 (163 Inflammatory Bowel Disease, 17 Irritable Bowel
Syndrome/non-IBD) patients were enrolled at 3 clinical sites. Each patient
was assessed for active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel
syndrome (IBS). In addition, each patient was diagnosed using in-house
procedures and a single serum specimen was collected for analysis with the
ASCA-CHEK test. For clinical sites #1 – 3, serum specimens were frozen and
sent to TECHLAB , Inc. for analysis for ASCA Ig. Site 1 and site 2 tested

Since frozen samples were used in the comparison studies, the sponsor
evaluated the effect of a single freeze-thaw cycle on test results in the serum
ASCA-CHEK test. For the analysis, 9 ASCA Ig-positive serum samples and
5 ASCA Ig-negative serum samples were tested. An aliquot from each
sample was removed and frozen at -20oC followed by a single thaw at room
temperature on the day of analysis. The test results for the frozen and
unfrozen specimens showed all negative samples remained negative and all
positive samples remained positive at all time periods.
b. Matrix comparison:
Serum is the only matrix tested in this submission.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity/ Clinical specificity:
The same samples used in method comparison were used to assess sensitivity
and specificity. In addition, 77 samples from adult patients were tested on
Site 4 (Kliniken Essen-Mitte) for clinical assessment. The following results
were obtained:
Site #1 (Children’s Hospital of Harvard Medical School)
False positive samples were from patients with ulcerative colitis. Sera from
non-Crohn’s disease tested in the ASCA-CHEK test showed a positivity range
