L. Test Principle:
Epithelial cells are immunomagnetically labeled by targeting the Epithelial Cell
Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) antigen. Anti-EpCAM monoclonal antibodies
conjugated to ferrofluid particles are colloidal and, when mixed with a sample
containing the target epithelial cells, bind to the EpCAM antigen associated with the
epithelial cells. After immunomagnetic selection of epithelial cells from 7.5 mL of
blood, fluorescent reagents are added at this time to discriminate between the
immunomagnetically selected cells. Anti-Cytokeratin – Phycoerythrin (CK-PE)

stains the intracellular cytoskeleton cytokeratin proteins expressed in cells of
epithelial origin, anti-CD45-Allophycocyan (CD45-APC) stains leukocytes and DAPI
stains DNA present in the cell nucleus.
The processed reagent/sample mixture is dispensed by the CellTracks® AutoPrep
System into a cartridge that is inserted into a MagNest® cell presentation device. The
strong magnetic field of the MagNest® device causes the magnetically-labeled target
cells to move to the surface of the cartridge. The cartridge is then placed on the
CellTracks® Analyzer II for data acquisition and analysis. The CellTracks Analyzer
II scans the entire surface of the cartridge with a series of fluorescence filters that are
defined for a given assay and acquires images of PE, APC and DAPI fluorescence
staining of the entire viewing surface.
After data acquisition is completed, the images are analyzed for any event where
cytokeratin-PE and DAPI are within a specified space in the cartridge, i.e. indicating
the possible presence of a cell with a nucleus that expresses cytokeratin. Images from
each fluorescent color as well as a composite image of the cytokeratin staining
(green) and the nuclear staining (purple) are presented to the user in a gallery for final
cell classification. A cell is classified as a tumor cell when it its EpCAM+ (i.e., it is
captured), CK+, DAPI+ and CD45-. A check mark placed by the operator next to the
composite images classifies the event as a Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) and the
software tallies all the checked boxes to obtain the CTC count.

Figure 3 Note: There may be more than one point superimposed over another. For example, on this plot,
there are 975 instances (60%) where both tubes had 0 CTC, 116 instances (7%) where Tube 1 had 0 CTC

Accuracy/Recovery:
Blood samples from a single healthy donor were pooled and five of six 7.5
mL aliquots were spiked with 5, 20, 81, 325 and 1300 cultured breast cancer
cells (SK-Br-3). The sixth tube was unspiked pooled blood and served as a
zero point. These samples were processed on the CellTracks® AutoPrep
System with the CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell Kit and CTC counts
were determined on the CellTracks® Analyzer II. The experiment was
repeated for four additional donors. The observed cell counts were plotted
against the results of the expected cell count. The results are summarized in
Table 2.

--- Page 7 ---
Table 2. Percent Detection Estimates.
Mean Observed
Expected Tumor Cell Tumor Cell
Count Count Range of Percent Recovery
1300 1215 91 to 95%
325 308 82 to 101%
81 85 80 to 136%
20 22 95 to 140%
5 7 120 to 200%
To determine the overall, or least squares fit, for the comparison of the
observed and expected cell counts across all the data, linear regression
analysis was performed. The regression equation for these 30 samples was
y=0.93x + 3.87, R2=0.999. The results of this study indicate that on average
over the tested CTC range the recovery, as derived from regression analysis, is
93%.
Given the linear response of the tumor cell counts, one would expect the slope
of the observed versus expected plot to be 1.0. However, the slope was 0.93.
This is because the CellTracks® AutoPrep System with CellSearch™ CTC Kit
involves the capture and fluorescent labeling of cells followed by their
detection and enumeration by the CellTracks® Analyzer II. The loss of cells
could therefore be attributed to one of the following possibilities; 1) the
recovery of only 93% of the tumor cells spiked into 7.5mL of blood by the
CellTracks® AutoPrep System, 2) the detection of only 93% of the tumor cells
present in the sample chamber by the CellTracks® Analyzer II or 3) a
combination of both of these sources of error.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Another way to examine the previous data is to analyze it as a dilution series
to evaluate test linearity. The confounding variable of percent recovery was
removed by using the observed value of the original sample divided by the
dilution factors to determine the expected values for the dilution series for
each patient sample. Regression of all of these numbers of observed tumor
cells versus the numbers of expected tumor cells yielded a slope of 1.007, an
intercept of 3.0, an r2 = 0.99 and r = 0.995. Therefore, once the percent
recovery (cell loss) was factored out of the CTC values of each of the original
samples, this analysis of the data demonstrated that the detection of CTC was
linear over the reportable range of 0 to 1238 tumor cells.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
No recognized reference material or method.
d. Detection limit:
One CTC per 7.5 mL can be detected by the CellTracks® Analyzer II resulting
in a limit of detection of 1 CTC in a cartridge. Linear regression shows that
on average, 93% of CTC present in a 7.5 mL blood sample are recovered

20	22	95 to 140%

--- Page 8 ---
using the CellTracks® AutoPrep System (see Recovery section). The loss of
approximately 7% of the CTC in the sample is not sufficient to reduce the
limit of detection of 1 CTC.
e. Analytical specificity, Interfering Substances:
SK-BR-3 cells spiked into blood samples were exposed to potential interfering
substances and compared to untreated controls. Toxic levels (5 times
therapeutic index) of the following cancer drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and
other exogenous substances were tested: cyclophosphamide, Mitomycin C®,
Procrit®, biotin, 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate, tamoxifen citrate, paclitaxel,
Arimidex®, acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, dextromethorphan,
Aredia®, Human Anti-Mouse Antibody (HAMA) type 1, HAMA type 2,
Herceptin®, and ibuprofen. No significant differences in SK-BR-3 cell
numbers were detected, indicating that these substances do not interfere with
the CellSearch™ kit.
Samples spiked with toxic levels of doxorubicin resulted in aberrant staining
of leukocytes as cytokeratin and CD45 dual positive cells, due to the
doxorubicin being a fluorescent compound that is incorporated into nucleated
cells. If seen, the staining pattern of all cells being CD45 positive and
cytokeratin positive is obvious and easily identified by the operator as a
known interference staining profile. If blood is drawn after the recommended
7-day washout period, following doxorubicin infusion, this interference is
unlikely to be observed in clinical practice given controlled therapeutic levels
and rapid drug clearance.
Potential interference from lipemia was studied by adding Intralipid to
samples to a concentration of 2.6%, which corresponds to greater than 1000
mg/dL triglyceride. Samples were lysed to simulate total hemolysis.
Bilirubin at 7.4 mg/dL, HAMA 1/HAMA 2 and hematocrit from 18-60% were
studied. Lipemia, hemolysis, icterus and a broad range of hematocrit values
do not interfere with the CellSearch™ test. HAMA 1 and HAMA 2 also do
not interfere, indicating that individuals receiving mouse Ig by parenteral
routes can be tested successfully with the CellSearchTM test.
f. Assay cut-off:
Results are reported as the number of CTC/7.5 mL of blood. A CTC count of
3 or more per 7.5 mL of blood is predictive of shorter progression free
survival and overall survival for colorectal cancer.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Direct comparison to the predicate device is not feasible since the patient
population used by the two tests is different (metastatic breast cancer vs.
metastatic colon cancer) rather, clinical studies are necessary to establish the
new indication for use. These were performed by the sponsor.
b. Matrix comparison:
Since there is only one matrix for this test, i.e. whole blood, no matrix
comparison studies were performed.

CLINICAL STUDIES TO SUPPORT USE OF VERIDEX CTC TEST WITH
METASTATIC COLON CANCER (MCRC) PATIENTS
A multi-center prospective, clinical trial was conducted to determine whether the number
of CTC predicted disease progression and survival. Metastatic colorectal cancer patients
with measurable (N=430) disease starting a new line of therapy were enrolled. Clinical
data were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. Patient demographic information is
presented in Table 3.
Baseline CTC count was determined prior to initiation of a new line of therapy. Follow-
up CTC counts were determined after the initiation of therapy at approximately 3 to 4
week intervals. For the baseline analyses, Progression Free Survival (PFS) was measured
from the time of the baseline blood draw to the diagnosis of progression by CT scans
and/or clinical signs and symptoms, and Overall Survival (OS) was measured from the
time of baseline blood draw to the time of death. For the follow-up analyses, PFS was
measured from the time of the follow-up blood draw to diagnosis of progression or death,
and OS was measured from the time of the follow-up blood draw to the time of death.

1.1 CTC frequencies
Of the total number of 430 MCRC patients, 9 had a baseline blood draw and no follow-
up blood draws. Of these 9 patients, four died before a follow-up blood draw could be
obtained, two were taken off their therapy due to treatment related toxicity, one patient
had surgery to remove their measurable disease, one patient refused further treatment,
and one patient refused any further blood draws. Of the remaining patients, 362, 342,
321, and 211 had follow-up blood draws 1-2 weeks, 3-5 weeks, 6-12 weeks, and 13-20
weeks after the initiation of therapy, respectively. The difference in the number of
patients evaluable for PFS and OS at each time point is due to the progression of some
patients prior to the blood draw, while the difference in the number of patients at each
time point is due to the number of patients with blood draws and evaluable CTC results.
Table 4 shows the numbers of patients at each time point excluded from the PFS, OS, or
PFS & OS analyses and the reasons for their exclusion.

The CTC results obtained from the follow-up blood draws at 1-2 weeks, 3-5 weeks, 6-12
weeks, and 13-20 weeks after the initiation of therapy were classified as being favorable
(<3 CTC) or unfavorable (>3 CTC). If more than one CTC result was obtained within
any of the designated follow-up time points, the CTC result from the blood draw furthest
from the baseline blood draw was used.
Table 6 summarizes the total number of MCRC patients and percentage of patients with
unfavorable CTC in the clinical trial that differs from the numbers and percentages of
patients for Progression Free Survival shown in Table 5.
1.2 Progression Free Survival (PFS) Analysis of MCRC Patients
PFS Using Baseline CTC Results
413 of the 430 MCRC patients had a baseline CTC result available. For Kaplan-Meier
analysis, patients were segmented into two groups based upon their CTC count at
baseline:
• The Favorable group (N=305), represented in green, consisted of patients with <3
CTC.
• The Unfavorable group (N=108), represented in red, consisted of patients with >3
CTC.

PFS Using Follow-up CTC Results
For Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients were segmented into two groups based upon their
CTC count at each of the various follow-up blood draws. Both patient groups at each of
the different follow-up blood draw times after initiation of therapy for PFS are illustrated
in Figure 4. PFS times were calculated from the time of each blood draw, and any
patient showing evidence of progression prior to a particular blood draw was excluded
from the analysis of that and all subsequent follow-up blood draws. Figure 4 illustrates
the ability of CTC in MCRC patients with <3 and >3 CTC 1-2 weeks, 3-5 weeks, 6-12
weeks, and 13-20 weeks after the initiation of therapy to predict PFS.
• The Favorable group, represented in olive green, blue, purple, and cyan, consisted
of patients with <3 CTC,
• The Unfavorable group, represented in brown, black, grey, and orange, consisted of
patients with >3 CTC.

CTC/7.5mL whole blood) at any of the time points had a much higher likelihood of rapid
progression than did those with <3 CTC. Table 5 column 4 shows the median PFS times
for those patients with <3 CTC ranged from 6.3 to 7.9 months and were substantially
longer than the median PFS times for those patients with >3 CTC, which ranged from 1.2
to 4.5 months (column 5).
Reduction or Increase in CTC Predicts Improved or Decreased PFS
Elapsed PFS times were calculated from the baseline blood draw. For Kaplan-Meier
analysis (Figure 5), MCRC patients were segmented into four groups based upon their
CTC counts at baseline, 1-2 weeks, 3-5 weeks, 6-12 weeks, and 13-20 weeks:
• Group 1 (green curve), 303 (70%) patients with <3 CTC at all time points. Seven
(2%) of these patients only had a baseline blood draw while eight (3%) had a single
blood draw between their first and last blood draw that had >3 CTC;
• Group 2 (blue curve), 74 (17%) patients with >3 CTC prior to the initiation of
therapy but who had decreased to <3 CTC at the time of their last blood draw;
• Group 3 (orange curve), 29 (7%) patients with <3 CTC at an early draw (baseline, 1-
2 weeks, and/or 3-5 weeks) but who increased to ≥3 CTC at the time of their last
blood draw;
• Group 4 (red curve), 24 (6%) patients with >3 CTC at all time points. Three (13%)
of these patients had only a baseline blood draw, one (4%) had only a 3-5 week blood
draw, and one (4%) had a single blood draw between their first and last blood draw
that had <3 CTC.

Figure 5 shows that MCRC patients with >3 CTC at all time points (Group 4) had the
shortest median PFS, which was significantly different compared to the median PFS of
Group 3, Group 2 and Group 1. The difference in the median PFS between those
patients who showed a CTC reduction after the initiation of therapy (Group 2) was
significantly longer compared to those patients who showed a CTC increase (Group 3).
1.3 Overall Survival (OS) Analysis of MCRC Patients
OS Analysis Using Baseline CTC Results
Death occurred in 202 (47%) of the 430 MCRC patients, with a mean follow-up time for
the 228 (53%) patients still alive of 12.6 + 6.5 months (median = 11.0, range = 0.8 –
30.0). At the time of these analyses, 124 (41%) of 305 patients from Favorable group (<3
CTC at baseline) compared to 68 (63%) of 108 from Unfavorable group (>3 CTC at
baseline) had died.
For Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients were segmented into two groups based upon their
CTC count at baseline:
• The Favorable group (N=305), represented in green, consisted of patients with <3
CTC.
• The Unfavorable group (N=108), represented in red, consisted of patients with >3
CTC.

--- Page 16 ---
Median OS was significantly longer in the Favorable group compared to the Unfavorable
group (18.5 vs. 9.4 months, respectively). These results are illustrated in Figure 6.

As illustrated in Figure 7 and Table 6 in columns 4 & 5, MCRC patients with >3 CTC at
any of the time points had a much higher likelihood of dying sooner than did those with
<3 CTC. The median OS times for those patients with <3 CTC ranged from 14.6 to 18.5
months and were substantially longer than the median OS times for those patients with
>3 CTC, which ranged from 3.3 to 9.4 months.

Figure 8 shows that MCRC patients who exceed the threshold of 3 CTC at any point
after the initiation of therapy had a much higher likelihood of dying sooner. Patients with
>3 CTC at all time points (Group 4) had the shortest median OS, which was significantly
different compared to the median OS of Group 3, Group 2 and Group 1. Patients with
<3 CTC at all time points (Group 1) had the longest median OS, which was significantly
different compared to the median OS of Group 4, Group 3 and Group 2. Figure 8 also
shows that patients who show a decrease in CTC (Group 2) have a significantly lower
risk of death compared to those patients with an increase in CTC (Group 3).
Univariate Cox Regression Analysis in MCRC Patients
The following parameters were analyzed using Univariate Cox regression analysis to
evaluate association with PFS and OS: gender, stage of disease at diagnosis (1-4), time to
metastasis (continuous), patient age (>65 or <65), site of primary disease (colorectal or
rectal or colon), ECOG status before initiation of a new line of therapy (0-2), line of
therapy (1nd or 2nd or 3rd), presence of liver metastasis (yes or no), type of therapy
(bevacizumab, irinotecan, and/or oxaliplatin included or not), baseline CTC counts (>3 or
<3 CTC/7.5mL), and follow-up CTC counts 1-2 weeks, 3-5 weeks, 6-12 weeks and 13-20
weeks after the initiation of therapy (>3 or <3 CTC/7.5mL). Table 7 shows the results of
this analysis and presents the Cox hazard ratio (HR) and associated p-value (Wald test of

Multivariate Cox Regression Analysis in MCRC Patients
Multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the independent
predictive power of CTC count by adjusting for the effects of the known important
clinical factors that are statistically significant in the univariate analyses. CTC were
found to be strong predictors of PFS and OS (Table 8).

1.4 Use of CTC to Monitor Clinical Status of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
Relationship between survival, CTC, and disease assessment by imaging
Radiological imaging is one of the primary means used to determine disease status and
response to therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer patients. To establish the relationship
of clinical status as determined by imaging to CTC, CTC measured at two different
timepoints and imaging results were compared 1) to the true clinical endpoint overall
survival and 2) to each other.

CTC
Previous data has shown that metastatic colorectal cancer patients with >3 CTC / 7.5mL
of blood at any succeeding follow-up visit after the initiation of therapy had a higher
likelihood of progressive disease and decreased overall survival compared to patients
with <3 CTC / 7.5mL of blood. The CTC results obtained 3-5 weeks after the initiation
of therapy as well as the CTC results obtained within + one month of the imaging study
were classified as Favorable (<3 CTC) and Unfavorable (>3 CTC). If more than one
CTC value was obtained within + one month of the imaging study, the CTC result
obtained closest to the date of the imaging study was used.
Imaging
Each MCRC patient had to have measurable disease, i.e. a minimum of one 2cm lesion
up to and including a maximum of 10 such lesions. The method of imaging for each
patient was determined by the treating oncologist in keeping with the current standard of
care. Either CT or MRI of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were performed with the
requirement that all lesions seen at baseline were followed using the same method for all
subsequent imaging studies. Image interpretation was performed by a certified
radiologist at the participating site using RECIST uni-dimensional criteria to classify
each follow-up disease assessment as complete response (CR), partial response (PR),
stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD).
Each patient was imaged at a minimum of two time points up to 8 different time points.
These studies included a baseline image, imaging at subsequent intervals of 2-3 months
(6-12 weeks), and a final image study when the patient went off study. Copies of all
patients’ imaging studies were forwarded to the study coordinator at each clinical site for
filing with the patient clinical data.
Out of the total of 430 evaluable MCRC patients enrolled into the study, 28 (7%) did not
have a follow-up imaging study performed, 18 (4%) died before a follow-up imaging
study could be performed, and 384 (89%) had one or more follow-up imaging studies
performed that were assessed using RECIST criteria. At the time of the 1st follow-up in
the 384 patients with a follow-up imaging study, 4 (1%) showed a complete response,
117 (31%) showed a partial response, 186 (48%) had stable disease, and 77 (20%)
showed progressive disease. For the purposes of these analyses, patients who died before
a follow-up imaging study were considered to have progressive disease.
For response to therapy at the first follow-up disease assessment, the Favorable group
was defined as those having stable disease (S), partial response (PR) or a complete
response (CR) by RECIST criteria (non-progressive disease, NPD) and the Unfavorable
group as those with progressive disease or death (PD).
Relationship between survival to imaging and CTC
Separate Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to compare the overall survival of
MCRC patients in the Favorable (<3 CTC) and Unfavorable (>3 CTC) groups using CTC
results at two different time points and the first follow-up imaging study. Using results
from the first follow-up imaging studies performed 9.1 + 2.9 weeks (median = 8.6 weeks)
after initiation of therapy (i.e. the baseline blood draw), the median survival of the 307
22

--- Page 23 ---
(76%) patients determined by imaging to have NPD was 19.1 months (95% CI = 17.0 to
23.1) (Figure 9, Table 9). For the 95 (24%) patients determined by imaging to have PD,
the median survival was 5.8 months (95% CI= 4.4 to 7.7).
A total of 320 MCRC patients had imaging studies performed before and after initiation
of therapy or they died prior to a follow-up imaging study being performed and they had
CTC assessed 3-5 weeks after initiation of therapy (average = 3.8 + 0.7 weeks from the
time of the baseline blood draw, median = 4.0 weeks). The median survival of 282
(88%) patients with Favorable CTC results (<3 CTC) was 17.3 months (95% CI = 15.0 to
19.5 months) (Figure 10, Table 9). The 38 patients (12%) with Unfavorable CTC results
(>3 CTC) had a median survival of 5.4 months (95% CI = 3.6 to 9.4 months).
To determine if CTC assessments performed closer to the time of the imaging resulted in
similar survival prospects compared to CTC assessments performed approximately 4
weeks after the initiation of therapy, only those patients with CTC assessments performed
within + one month of the first follow-up imaging study were analyzed (Figure 11,
Table 9). Three hundred and sixty-four (364) of the 402 patients (91%) had CTC
assessments within one month of the first follow-up imaging study, which was performed
9.0 + 2.9 weeks (median = 8.5 weeks) after the initiation of therapy. The median survival
of 335 (92%) patients with Favorable CTC results was 17.2 months (95% CI = 15.0 to
19.2 months). For the 29 (8%) patients with Unfavorable CTC results, the median
survival was 5.4 months (95% CI = 3.2 to 7.5 months). These data show that CTC
assessments at both time points provide similar results to imaging conducted
approximately nine weeks after the initiation of therapy.
Applying multivariate Cox regression analysis to adjust for imaging indicates that both
CTC and imaging at 6-12 weeks are independently associated with overall survival but
that CTC [adjusted hazard ratio: 7.9 (4.6-13.6)] are a stronger predictor than imaging
[adjusted hazard ratio: 3.1 (2.1-4.6)].

Concordances between CTC and Radiological Monitoring in MCRC Patients
As noted above, imaging studies are a major component of the current standard of care
for determining disease progression and response to treatment in the metastatic colorectal
cancer setting. To further support the effectiveness of CTC in making these clinical
assessments, two-by-two tabulations of concordant and discordant observations between
CTC and radiological imaging were constructed.
For response to therapy, the Favorable group was defined as those having stable disease
(S), partial response (PR) or a complete response (CR) by RECIST criteria (non-
progressive disease, NPD) and the Unfavorable group as those with progressive disease
(PD). Out of the 18 patients who died prior to a follow-up imaging study, 10 had a
follow-up blood draw within 30 days of death and these 10 patients were classified as
having progressive disease (PD) for the purposes of these comparisons.
The CTC results obtained within + one month of the imaging study were classified as
Favorable (<3 CTC) and Unfavorable (>3 CTC). If more than one CTC value was
obtained within + one month of the imaging study, the CTC result obtained closest to the
date of the imaging study was used. This analysis used all evaluable blood draws from
the patients to match up CTC with the imaging studies, not just the ones that were
selected for the designated time points as described in 1.1 above.

In serial observations, only a minority of the transitions for imaging results between
non-progressive disease and progressive disease coincided with a matching transition of
CTC counts between <3 and >3 CTC / 7.5 mL.
Because the prognostic value of the CTC results at an earlier time-point were equivalent
to that of the CTC results at the time of imaging (Figure 10 & Figure 11), a patient-wise
comparison using results from only the 1st follow-up imaging study, performed
approximately 9 weeks after the initiation of therapy, and the CTC results obtained
approximately 4 weeks after initiation of therapy was constructed. A total of 320 (80%)
of the 402 patients had CTC results 3-5 weeks after the initiation of therapy. The result
of this “patient-wise” comparison between CTC at an earlier time point and imaging (or
death) is shown in Table 12.

CTC as an Adjunct to Imaging
While the overall agreement between CTC and imaging was good (approximately 78%),
there was disagreement in approximately 22% of the MCRC patients. As the information
from CTC assessments is intended to be used in conjunction with other diagnostic
modalities to make treatment decisions, CTC assessment 3-5 weeks after the initiation of
therapy and imaging in the following groups were compared to OS to determine which of
the discordant results better reflected the prognosis of the patient:
• Group 1 (green curve), 228 (71%) patients with <3 CTC at 3-5 weeks and NPD;
• Group 2 (blue curve), 54 (17%) patients with <3 CTC at 3-5 weeks and PD;
• Group 3 (orange curve), 18 (6%) patients with >3 CTC at 3-5 weeks and NPD;
• Group 4 (red curve), 20 (6%) patients with >3 CTC at 3-5 weeks and PD.
