L. Test Principle:
The PBNP method is a one-step enzyme immunoassay based on the “sandwich”
principle. Sample is incubated with chromium dioxide particles coated with
monoclonal antibodies which recognize an epitope located in the N-terminal part of
proBNP, and a conjugate reagent [alkaline phosphatase (ALP)] labeled monoclonal
antibody specific for a second independent epitope on NT-proBNP, to form a
particle/NT-proBNP/ conjugate sandwich. Unbound conjugate is removed by
magnetic separation and washing. After separation and washing, the conjugate
sandwich is transferred to the cuvette where the sandwich-bound ALP triggers an
amplification cascade. ALP dephosphorylates synthetic flavin adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (FADP) to produce FAD. FAD binds to apo D-amino acid oxidase and
converts it to active holo D-amino acid oxidase. Each molecule of holo D-amino acid
oxidase produces multiple molecules of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). H2O2 in the
presence of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), converts 3,5-dichloro-2-
hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid (DCHBS) and 4-aminoantipyrine(4-AAP) to a colored
product that absorbs at 510 nm. The color change measured is directly proportional
to the concentration of NT-proBNP present in the patient sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was conducted in accordance with CLSI EP5-A2 guideline.
During each day of testing, two separate run, with two test samples for each
test material were analyzed for 20 days. The precision results are shown
below:
Within-Run Precision Within-lab precision
Mean SD SD
Sample % CV % CV
(pg/mL) (pg/mL) (pg/mL)
Human serum pool 1 136 6.0 4.4 7.7 5.6
Human plasma pool 1 123 5.3 4.3 6.8 5.6

Human plasma pool 3 1071 40.6 3.8 52.9 4.9
Human plasma pool 4 5359 203.2 3.8 287.9 5.4
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range of the assay is from 10-30,000 pg/mL. A high PBNP
plasma pool (PBNP = 31,883 pg/mL) was diluted with a low PBNP pool
(PBNP = 12 pg/mL) to produce 6 levels of PBNP. High range linearity was
evaluated by comparing observed vs. expected values obtained with the PBNP

method. A linear regression analysis was then performed on the data to yield
the following: slope = 1.0017, r =0.9989, intercept = 68.02 pg/mL. Percent
recoveries for the 6 levels ranged from 97 to 102 %. An additional study was
performed to assess low level linearity. A sample with a value of 1177 pg/mL
was diluted with a sample with a value of 21 pg/mL to produce 5 levels of
PBNP. A linear regression was performed on the data to yield the following:
slope = 1.014, r = 0.999, intercept = -14 pg/mL. The Y-intercept is not
statistically significant at a 95% confidence interval (CI) (p = 0.39, 95% CI –
60 to 31). The Passing-Bablock linear regression equation was 1.01, r =
0.9988, intercept = -12.9 pg/mL with 95 % CI -104 to +28). Percent recovery
ranged from 92 -102%. An additional low level linearity study was performed
using a serum sample with NT-proBNP = 1,081 pg/mL diluted with a level
one calibrator with a value of 0 pg/mL to produce 7 levels of PBNP. Passing-
Bablock linear regression provided a slope of 1.04 and an intercept of 0.60
pg/mL with 95% CI-9 to +8. Percent recovery ranged from 94 to 106 %.
Hook effect was evaluated using samples containing NT-proBNP
concentrations ranging from 0 to 750,000 pg/mL. The studies indicated that
there was no hook-effect up to 750,000 pg/mL. A claim of 300,000 pg/mL is
used. The Dimension® system will report an error code to the user when the
signal generated by a high sample exceeds a pre-defined limit.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The assay is referenced to Roche purified synthetic NT-proBNP. The
assigned values for the Dimension® PBNP Calibrator are referenced to a
master pool containing synthetic human N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic
peptide in a human serum matrix.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of the blank for the PBNP assay was determined to be 6.6 pg/mL. A
claim of ≤ 10 pg/mL is made. This was determined by assaying 20
consecutive replicates of the analyte free (0 level) calibrator. The value was
then calculated by determining the standard deviation (SD) of the 20
replicates, multiplying by 2, and adding it to the absolute value of the mean.
Functional sensitivity is defined as the analyte concentration corresponding to
a 20% inter-assay coefficient of variation (CV). This was determined by
performing a 20 day precision experiment using samples prepared from
normal human serum at appropriate concentrations. Two replicates of each
sample were analyzed twice per day for 20 days. Within lab CV was
computed by ANOVA and plotted versus the mean concentration. The
functional sensitivity was determined to be 17.5 pg/mL. A claim of ≤ 30
pg/mL is made.

e. Analytical specificity:
No significant interference was found for bilirubin (conjugated) up to 60
mg/dL, bilirubin (unconjugated) up to 60 mg/dL, hemoglobin up to 1000
mg/dL, triglycerides up to 3000 mg/dL, and rheumatoid factor up to 500
IU/mL. The pharmaceutical Natrecor® shows no significant cross reactivity
at 0 and 125 pg/mL NT-proBNP. An extensive list of other compounds was
evaluated for interference and was found to have no significant interference or
cross reactivity. A list of these compounds is presented in the labeling.
f. Assay cut-off:
See expected values below.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was conducted using split patient samples
between the Dimension NT-proBNP assay (modified) and the Dimension
NT-proBNP assay (predicate) with sample values ranging from 22 – 28,982
pg/mL using the Dimension RxL chemistry system. 122 heparinized plasma
samples were used and yielded the following correlation regression:
Intercept Correlation
Comparative Method Slope n
(pg/mL) Coefficient
Dimension NT-proBNP
1.02 - 5 0.99 122
assay (predicate)
Concordance testing was completed at a university setting. Concordance was
determined by comparing the results of the modified Dimension NT-proBNP
method with patient samples from both a reference study population and a
disease study population. The reference study examined 29 samples from a <
75years of age population and 18 samples from a ≥ 75 years of age
population. The disease study group examined 25 samples from each of the
New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes (I – IV). The cut-offs of 125
pg/mL for patients < 75 years of age, and 450 pg/mL for patients ≥ years of
age were used in the concordance determination. Concordance for the
reference group < 75 years old and ≥ 75 years old were both 100%.
Concordance for the disease group was 96% for Class I, 100% for Class.II,
96% for Class III, and 100% for Class IV. Average for the reference and
disease groups combined was 98.6%.

b. Matrix comparison:
A comparison of 63 matched serum and lithium heparin plasma samples
ranging from 36 to 26,327 pg/mL on the Dimension® system produced a
slope of 1.02, an intercept of 1.7 pg/mL and a correlation coefficient of 0.991
using Passing-Bablock linear regression statistics. Comparison of 59 matched
serum and sodium heparin plasma samples ranging from 11 to 25,734
pg/mLon the Dimension® RxL chemistry system produced a slope of 0.97, an
intercept of – 2.2 pg/mL and a correlation coefficient 0f 0.993 using Passing-
Bablock linear regression statistics.
