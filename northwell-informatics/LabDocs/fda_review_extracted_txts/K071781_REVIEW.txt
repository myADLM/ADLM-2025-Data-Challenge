reactive with Platelet Factor 4 (PF4) when it is complexed to polyanionic
compounds such as polyvinyl sulfonate (PVS). These antibodies are found in
some patients undergoing heparin therapy.

The Genetic Testing Institute’s (GTI) PF4 IgG™ is available in 13 and 45 Test
kits, and consists of microwell strips coated with immobilized PF4/PVS
Complexes, Positive and Negative Controls, PNPP Substrate, Goat anti-
human IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase enzyme, Wash Solution,
Diluent, Buffer, and Stop solution.

L. Test Principle:
Heparin induced antibodies are immunoglbulins which are present in the patient’s
serum suspected to have a Type II heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
Type II HIT is an adverse drug reaction caused by platelet-activating antibodies
that are produced as a result of heparin therapy.
Antibodies which bind to PF4/Heparin complexes also bind to PF4 when it is
complexed with other polyanionic compounds such as polyvinyl sulfonate (PVS).

In the PF4 IgG™ assay, test serum is diluted 1:50 and is then added to
microwells to which platelet Factor 4 (PF4) complexed to polyvinyl sulfonate
(PVS) which has been immobilized. The sample is incubated for 30 mins during
which any antibodies present in the test serum that recognizes a site on the
PF4/PV complex will bind. Following incubation, a wash step removes any
unbound antibodies. A goat anti-human IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate is
then added to the wells. Following incubation, another wash step is performed to
remove any unbound conjugate. An alkaline phosphate substrate is added to the
microwells, and following incubation, the reaction is stopped and the optical
density of the color that develops is measured in a spectrophotometer at 405 or
410 nm using a reference wave length of 490 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three samples were prepared by diluting a sample containing a high anti-
PF4/heparin antibody. The sample was diluted to obtain 3 separate samples
that had a low, medium, and high positive reactivity. These samples along
with the positive and negative control provided in the kit, were tested in
duplicate in the PF4 IgG™ assay in 10 separate assays.
The data were analyzed by ANOVA according to CLSI Document EP-5A2,
Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods;
Approved Guideline. The reportable result (positive or negative) was also
analyzed for agreement within and between runs according to CLSI
Document EP-12A Vol 22, No 14, User Protocol for Evaluation of Qualitative
Test Performance; Approved Guideline. There was 100% agreement between
the reportable results within run and between run for each sample tested.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
n/a
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Positive Control is prepared from the serum of individual(s) known to
contain an anit-PF4/heparin antibody based on a positive result in the
Serotonin Release Assay. Assay OD values should be ≤ 0.300.
The Negative Control is prepared form polls of normal human serum. Assay
values should be ≥ 1.800.
d. Detection limit:
n/a
e. Analytical specificity:
Interferants was spiked into a negative sample that contained no PF4/heparin
antibodies, and 3 positive samples that contained varying reactivity (low,
medium, and high) of PF4/heparin antibodies. The following concentrations
were evaluated: hemoglobin – 500 mg/dL, triglycerides – 500 mg/dL, and
bilirubin- 20 mg/dL. An equivalent aliquot of the compound used to prepare
the interferant was also spiked in to a separate sample and used as the control.
Samples containing the interfering substance and the control sample were
tested in replicates of 5 in the PF4 IgG™ assay. Results demonstrated no
significant difference in the mean value obtained for each of the test spiked
samples when compared to the control.
f. Assay cut-off:
Assay cut-off was determined from the normal range study to be ≥ 0.400
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A two site clinical study was conducted in which the PF4 IgG™ assay was
compared to the predicate (PF4 Enhanced®), and the Serotonin Release Assay
(SRA). At site 1, (n=229), and tested at GTI. At site 2 (n=171). All samples
were collected from patients receiving heparin treatment, and frozen until
testing. The SRA assay was conducted at the external sites.
