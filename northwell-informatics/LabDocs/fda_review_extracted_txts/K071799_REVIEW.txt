J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
The predicate device is BioStar OIA SHIGATOX – K061889 from Inverness Medical
BioStar Inc. The tests have similar Indications for Use but unlike the predicate, this
device allows the use of specimens in Cary Blair Transport media and use of an
additional broth enrichment media namely Gram Negative (GN) broth. The devices
use the same technology but slight differences in performance may result from using
transport media due to the additional dilution and additional time between collection
and analysis. The device operation, sample type and immunochemistry are similar to
other marketed products.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
N/A
L. Test Principle:
The OIA ShigaTox test is an optical immunoassay. This technology enables the
direct visual detection of a physical change in the optical thickness of molecular thin
films. The change is the result of antigen-antibody binding on an optical surface
(silicon wafer). In this device, the biological capture film is a combination of affinity
–purified polyclonal antibodies to Stx 1 & 2 relative. Samples suspected of containing
either or both of the toxins are mixed with reagents containing polyclonal antibodies
to Stx 1 & 2 conjugated to HRP. Once a sample containing toxins or either toxin is
applied to the surface, the immune complex of toxins and the anti-toxin-HRP
conjugate are bound to the surface antibodies. Following a wash step, a precipitating
substrate for HRP is added, and a thin film generated by the immobilized immune
complex is enhanced by the precipitation of the HRP product. Once washed and
dried, a simple color change relative to the gold background color is observed as a
purple spot on the gold background indicating the presence of Stx 1 or 2. If antigen is
not present in the specimen, no binding takes place, optical thickness remains
unchanged and the surface retains the original gold color indicating a negative result.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility studies were performed using a masked method at each of the
three Clinical Trial sites and three Point-of-Care sites. A panel of 27
randomly ordered and blinded fecal specimens, spiked with negative, low and
moderate levels of Toxin 1 and/or Toxin 2 were provided and tested on 3
successive days by each of the 6 sites. The specimens produced expected
results with the OIA SHIGATOX test (486/486) 100% of the time.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity was determined by adding known concentrations of
Shiga toxin 1 or 2 into the assay. Assays were done in triplicate with the OIA
SHIGA TOX test. The limit of detection was 1ng/ml for diluent, liquid and
semi-solid stool for both Toxin 1 & 2.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross Reactivity Study
Bacteria at 1x107 or greater cfu/mLwere tested with and without spiking with
5.0 ng/mL of Stx1 and 5.0 ng/mL of Stx2. Cryptosporidium and Giardia were
tested at 1x 106 cysts/mL and Candida albicans was tested at 9.3 x 107
cells/mL. At one clinical site, 3 specimens positive for Rota virus were also
tested and were negative by OIA. All members of the cross reactivity panel
produced the expected negative result without the toxin spike and the
expected positive result with the toxin spike. Organisms tested were as
follows:
Aeromonas hydrophila Giardia lamblia
Klebsiella pneumoniae
Bacillus cereus
Bacillus subtilis Peptostreptococcus anaerobius
Bacteroides fragilis Porphyromonas asaccharolytica
Bifidobacterium adolescentis Proteus vulgaris

Interfering substances Study
The OIA SHIGATOX assay was tested with 50% whole blood, 12.5 mg/g
mucin, 50% liquid Imodium AD, 50% Pepto Bismol, 50% Kaopectate and
29% barium sulfate to determine potential interference. Each interferent was
mixed with antigen diluent or a liquid or semisolid stool specimen and tested
with the assay. None of the substances interfered with the generation of a
positive signal or produced a false positive result.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Swab Sampling of Colonies from a Culture Plate (Colony Sweep
Method)
One clinical site evaluated twenty two frozen fecal specimens in a colony
sweep procedure. These samples were previously found to contain Shiga
toxin producing E. coli. All samples were streaked onto XLD (xylose
lysine deoxycholate) plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. One sample
failed to produce any growth. A sterile rayon swab was used to sweep the
first and second quadrants of the growth area and was then immersed into
a reaction tube containing 3 drops each of Reagents 1 and 2 and the
standard assay protocol followed. The OIA SHIGATOX assay detected
21/21 of the colony sweeps that produced growth for 100% agreement
with the previous specimen result.
Direct Stool
A prospective study was conducted at three clinical trial sites in the
Eastern, Southern and Western regions of the United States to compare the
performance of the BioStar OIA SHIGATOX to a commercial EIA test.
Sites analyzed the stool specimens collected for direct testing from the
stool sample by both assays and then placed an aliquot of the stool in
MacConkey broth within 48 hours of specimen collection. Broth cultures
were incubated for 20 – 30 hours and then tested by both immunoassays.
A SMAC culture (Sorbitol MacConkey plates) was also plated within 48
hours of the specimen collection for the determination of E. coli O157.

All positive results from either immunoassay method were confirmed by
cytotoxicity testing, CTA.
A total of 272 prospective specimens from diarrheal patients were tested
in the OIA SHIGATOX and the EIA method.

Of the five OIA+/EIA - specimens, one was positive by CTA. One of the
samples that was negative by direct stool testing in both the EIA and the
OIA methods was positive in the OIA broth culture sample and by CTA
from the direct stool.
Two of the clinical sites also performed a study in which sixty-two
additional frozen specimens were prospectively tested by OIA
SHIGATOX and EIA without the operator’s knowledge of the original
Shiga toxin result.

Ninety eight frozen fecal specimens were collected from 2 lab sites. Fecal
specimens were thawed and tested directly in the BioStar OIA SHIGA
TOX Assay and used to inoculate Cary Blair transport media. Testing of
the Cary Blair specimens was performed within 1 hour and 24 hours of
inoculation. Of the 32 positive and 66 negative specimens, 28 were
positive and 70 negative after 1 hr of Cary Blair inoculation while 29
were positive and 69 negative after 24 hrs. At 1 hr. positive agreement
was 88% and negative agreement 100% while at 24 hours positive
agreement was 91% and negative agreement 100%.

The single OIA SHIGATOX +/EIA – result was confirmed to be a true
positive by the CTA analysis of the direct stool.
In the prospective frozen sample study, ten of the frozen specimens were
not tested in overnight Sorbitol MacConkey broth culture. Two of the
remaining specimens failed to exhibit growth after overnight Sorbitol
MacConkey broth culture. The percent positive agreement was 100% and
the percent negative agreement was 96.4%. The overall percent agreement

Ninety eight fecal specimens were thawed and inoculated into MacConkey
(MAC) broth and Gram Negative (GN) broth. The tubes were incubated
for 24 hrs at 37°C and then each sample was tested in the OIA Shiga TOX
Assay. In addition, the Cary Blair samples held for 24 hrs. at room
temperature were used to inoculate both GN and MAC broths. All
samples were incubated for 24 hrs at 37°C and tested in the OIA Shiga
TOX method. From MAC broth 26 samples were positive and 44

negative and from GN broth 28 were positive and 42 negative. Positive
agreement was 100% and negative agreement 95%. From the Cary Blair
samples in GN broth, 27 were positive and 41 negative and from direct
MAC broth 26 were positive and 42 negative. Positive agreement was
100% and negative agreement 98%. From Cary Blair samples in MAC
broth 29 were positive and 42 negative while from the direct MAC broth
28 were positive and 43 negative. Positive agreement was 93% and
negative agreement was 93%.
SMAC Culture
Two hundred and sixty nine (269) of the direct stool samples were
analyzed by SMAC culture. The OIA SHIGATOX and EIA assays were
compared to the SMAC culture results. Interpretation of the comparison
between the OIA SHIGATOX or the EIA test and SMAC is confounded
by the fact that, as a metabolic test, SMAC is specific for E. coli O157:H7,
while OIA SHIGATOX reacts with all Shiga toxin-producing E. coli
(STEC). Also, SMAC requires the presence of live cells in the sample,
while the OIA SHIGATOX test does not have that limitation. Based on
these differences, it was anticipated that a number of samples could be
SMAC-negative and OIA SHIGATOX positive.

The one apparent OIA false negative result compared to the SMAC result
was not confirmed by CTA and was not positive by EIA. Of the 8
apparent false positives by the OIA method, 4 of the samples were
positive by CTA. The second EIA false negative result was positive by
CTA and the OIA method. One of the OIA +/SMAC + samples was
negative by CTA. The 2 EIA -/SMAC + samples were negative by CTA
and one of the samples was negative by the OIA method as well. Three of
the EIA +/SMAC – samples were positive by CTA and the OIA method.
The remaining EIA +/SMAC – sample was negative by CTA but positive
by the OIA method.
In addition, two of the clinical sites conducted a prospective comparison
of the OIA method to SMAC culture using frozen samples. Thawed
aliquots of all samples were tested in the OIA and SMAC methods for this
comparison.

All thirteen of the OIA+/SMAC- samples were positive for STEC in
previous testing.
CTA
In the clinical study there were 19 specimens positive by OIA, EIA, or
both methods. An aliquot of the stool specimen for each of these 19
specimens was submitted for CTA along with an aliquot of the broth
culture media. One sample produced an inconclusive result and was
excluded from this analysis. Thirteen of the samples were positive by
CTA. The OIA SHIGATOX detected 12 of these 13 samples while the
EIA method detected 11. Twelve of the broth aliquots were positive by
CTA. The OIA SHIGATOX assay detected all 12 of these samples as did
the EIA method. Of the 13 CTA positives, SMAC was positive for only 8
samples.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Major outbreaks of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) are usually considered local,
appearing in a specific area and requiring concentrated investigation by public health
personnel. Prevalence rates may therefore vary greatly based on a number of factors,
including geographic location, patient demographics, sampling and testing methodology.
The increasing role of non-O157:H7 strains have further confounded prevalence
estimates.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
