L. Test Principle:
The Ethyl Alcohol Assay is based on an enzymatic reaction. Reagent 1 contains
the buffering system. Reagent 2 contains alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), the
coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), buffer, preservatives, and
stabilizers. The ADH catalyzes the oxidation of ethyl alcohol to acetaldehyde.
During this reaction, NAD is reduced to NADH. The absorbance due to NADH
(proportional to the ETOH concentration) is determined using a two-filter (340-
383 nm) bichromatic rate technique.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted by testing three levels of a commercially
available control, serum pool, plasma pool and a urine pool. The samples were
run in duplicate, twice a day for twenty days using one lot and one instrument.
The results are presented in the table below:
Low Medium High Serum Pool Plasma Pool Urine Pool

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity samples for plasma, serum and urine were prepared from two pools
of each sample type with ethanol concentrations near the extremes of the
assay range (low pool 0 mg/dL and high pool 345 mg/dL). The two pools
were mixed to create 7 additional pools of intermediate concentrations. Five
determinations of each pool were tested and a linear regression analysis was
performed by the method of least squares. The instrument generates a flag
which states “Above Assay Range” or "Below Assay Range". In addition to
this, automatic dilutions are performed by the instrument for results that fall
outside the assay range. Automatic dilutions are defined in the method
parameters and cannot be changed by an operator.

This device does not include calibrators. The sponsor recommends using
calibrators by Dade Behring Inc. ALC Calibrator, Catalog Number DC37A
cleared k904308.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit represents the lowest concentration of analyte that can be
detected with at least 95% probability. CLSI EP17-A was followed using 60
replicate determinations at two concentration levels to determine Limit of the
Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD). The LoD is 3 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The Dimension ETOH assay was evaluated for interference according to CLSI EP7-
A2. The following substances demonstrated no significant bias (defined as < 10 %).
