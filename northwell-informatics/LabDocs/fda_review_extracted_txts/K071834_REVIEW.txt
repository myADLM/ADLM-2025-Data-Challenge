The Stratus CS® Acute Care™ NT-proBNP method is a two-site sandwich assay based upon
solid phase Radial Partition Immonoassay (RPIA) technology. Dendrimer linked monoclonal
antibody is added to the center portion of a square piece of glass fiber paper in the proBNP
TestPak. This antibody recognizes a distinct antigenic site on the NT-proBNP molecule.
Sample is then added onto the paper where it reacts with the immobilized antibody. After a
short incubation, a conjugate consisting of enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody directed
against a second distinct antigenic site on the NT-proBNP molecule is pipetted onto the
reaction zone of the paper. During this second incubation period, enzyme-labeled antibody
reacts with the bound NT-proBNP, forming an antibody-antigen-labeled antibody sandwich.
The unbound labeled antibody is later eluted form the field of view of the Stratus® CS
analyzer by applying a substrate wash solution to the center of the reaction zone. By
including substrate for the enzyme within the wash solution, initiation of enzyme activity
occurs simultaneously with the wash. The enzymatic rate of the bound fraction increases
directly with the concentration of NT-proBNP in the sample. The reaction rate can then be
measured by an optical system that monitors the reaction rate via front surface fluorescence.
All data analysis functions are performed by the microprocessor within the analyzer.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was conducted in accordance with CLSI EP5-A guideline. Three levels
of controls and 3 levels of pooled serum were analyzed in duplicate once per day for 20
days. The precision results are shown below:

Control Level 3 7487 330 4.4 344 4.6
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was conducted to compare observed versus expected values obtained with
the Stratus CS Acute Care pBNP method using a high concentration NT-proBNP plasma
sample diluted across the expected range with a low sample. The sponsor’s acceptance
criterion was ≤10% deviations from the expected recovery. Samples range tested was 122 –
19,485 pg/mL and recovery ranged from 90.9% to 100%. A linear regression analysis was

performed on the data to yield the following: slope = 0.98, intercept = 229.3, and r = 0.998.
In addition, a low end linearity range was also conducted with the same procedure.
Samples range tested was 17 – 1201 pg/mL and recovery ranged from 100% to 108.9%. A
linear regression analysis was performed on the data to yield the following: slope = 0.99,
intercept = 18.776, r = 0.9987.
The data provided in the linearity study and the detection limit study below supports the
sponsor’s claim that this test has a reportable range of 15-20,000 pg/mL.
Hook effect was evaluated using 6 samples containing NT-pro-BNP concentrations ranging
from 0- 833,585 pg/mL. The sponsor claimed that there is no hook effect up to 833,585
pg/mL.
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
There are no changes to the calibrators or traceability of the assay. See performance
characteristics established in k043476.
d. Detection limit:
A detection limit study was performed to assess the analytical sensitivity (limit of blank)
and functional sensitivity (limit of quantitation) for the Stratus CS® Acute Care™
NT-proBNP assay. LoB is defined as the lowest detectable level of NT-proBNP that can
be distinguished from zero. It is calculated as the absolute mean plus two standard
deviations of 20 replicates of an analyte free sample in a single run. The calculated limit
of blank is 1.5 pg/mL. LoQ is defined as the lowest analyte concentration corresponding
to a total CV of 20%. It is determined by performing a 20-day, two replicates per day
precision study, using samples prepared from normal human plasma at appropriate
NT-proBNP concentrations. The calculated limit of quantitation is 15 pg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was conducted based on the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. A plasma
pool at a proBNP concentration of 125 pg/mL was spiked with the appropriate
concentration of the test substance or the solvent for the test substance (control). No
significant interference is defined as < 10% difference in recovery between the test and
the control sample. No significant interference was found for bilirubin up to 60 mg/dL,
hemoglobin up to 1000 mg/dL, triglycerides up to 3000 mg/dL, and rheumatoid factor up
to 500 IU/mL.
Specificity:
The pharmaceutical Natrecor® shows no significant cross reactivity (less than 1 %) at a
concentration of 3.5 µg/mL when added to samples containing 0 and 125 pg/mL NT-
proBNP. An extensive list of other compounds was evaluated for interference and was
found to have no significant interference or cross reactivity. A list of these compounds is

present in the labeling.
f. Assay cut-off:
See expected values below.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was conducted using split patient samples between the
Stratus CS Acute Care NT-proBNP assay (modified) and the Stratus CS Acute Care
NT-proBNP assay (predicate) with sample values ranging from 21.7 – 18680.5 pg/mL.
148 heparinized plasma were used and yielded the following Passing Bablok regression:
Intercept Correlation
Comparative Method Slope n
(pg/mL) Coefficient
Stratus CS Acute Care NT-proBNP assay
1.02 8.2 0.99 148
(predicate)
A concordance study was completed internally and at an external site. Concordance was
determined by comparing the results of the modified device and the predicate device
with patient samples from both a reference study population and a disease study
population. The reference study examined 29 samples ranging from 15 to 356 pg/mL
from < 75 years of age population and 20 samples ranging from 57.9 to 4880.5 pg/mL
from ≥ 75 years of age population. The disease study group examined 25 samples from
each of the New York Heart Association classes (I-IV), ranging from 20.9 to 29662
pg/mL. The cut-offs of 125 pg/mL for patients < 75 years and 450 pg/mL for patients ≥
75 years of age were used in the concordance determination. Concordance for 149
samples from both the reference and disease population ranged from 96-100%.
b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study between the lithium heparin and sodium heparin was
conducted using 51 paired plasma samples. The lithium heparin samples ranging from
31.2 to 16,445 pg/mL. Percent difference ranged from -14.2 % to 9.5%. A linear
regression between these two matrices gave a slope of 1.06, an intercept of -75 pg/mL
and a correlation coefficient of 0.997.
The sponsor claimed that both lithium heparin and sodium heparin may be used for the
pro-BNP assay. Serum samples should not be used with the pro-BNP assay.
