horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-human IgG antibody is added and incubated
(Conjugate incubation). Following another washing step, the peroxidase substrate is
added and incubated for an additional period of time (Substrate incubation). Acid
solution is then added to each well to terminate the enzyme reaction and to stabilize
the color development. The assay can be quantified by measuring the reaction
photometrically.
The MESACUP BP230 TEST measures anti-BP230 antibodies present in the serum
by ELISA. Same as for the MESACUP BP180 Test.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra-assay Precision
Variability within a plate (intra-assay precision) was determined by testing
each of three samples 8 times on three separate assay runs using two different
lots. The three separate plates employed were randomly selected from each
plate coating run (kit lot). An additional study covering the low end of the
measuring range was requested and data provided. Resulting intra-assay
coefficients of variation (%CVs) were determined from values obtained and
summarized in the tables below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
There is no claim for linearity for this assay.
The assay reportable range is from 5-150 U/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no reference standard for Anti-BP180 and BP230. The calibrators
are prepared in-house and arbitrary units are assigned during development
process. Positive and negative controls are not supplied but are
recommended.
Specimens that were positive by both ELISA and IFA were evaluated to
determine the assay’s upper optical density detection limit. Fifty percent of
the upper detection limit was arbitrarily assigned a value of 100 U/mL.
Subsequent calibrators are prepared and compared to initial testing. Kit
recovery is correlated with previous lots by testing a serum panel and
comparing historical values.
Three lots each of BP180 kit and BP230 kit were put into stability program to
assure consistent and reliable results over time. All kit components were
stored appropriately at 2-8oC and tested at nine month intervals. The assays
were performed using BP180 and BP230 reactive samples and healthy blood
donor samples. All the sample results were within expected value in the
study. The shelf life of the BP180and BP230 kits was determined to be 13
months from date of production.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering Substances
Potentially interfering substances (bilirubin C = 39.0 mg/dL, bilirubin F =
37.2 mg/dL, hemoglobin = 440.0 mg/dL, chyle = 2350 turbidity units, and RF
= 1000 IU/mL) were spiked into three patient specimens (negative, low and
high positive). No significant effect on assay results was noted by addition of
these substances.
Cross Reactivity
Two cross-reactivity studies were performed, one using samples from Japan
and the other from US for both BP180 and BP230 ELISA tests. Results of the
two studies are shown below.
