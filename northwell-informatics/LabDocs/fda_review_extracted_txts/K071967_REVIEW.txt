E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Sysmex XE-5000 is part of The XE-Series instrument line. It is a multi-
parameter hematology analyzer intended to perform tests in anticoagulated blood
and body fluids. The instrument consists of three principal units: (1) Main Unit
which aspirates dilutes, mixes and analyzed blood and body fluid simples; (2)
Auto Sampler Units supplies samples to the Main Unit automatically; (3) IPU
(Information Processing Unit) which processes data from the Main Unit and
provides the operator interface with the system. The XE-5000 is equipped with a
Sampler that provides continuous automated sampling for up to 100 tubes.
2. Principles of Operation:
The Sysmex XE-5000 performs analyses using the following methods: RF/DC
Detection Method, Sheath Flow DC Detection Method, and Flow Cytometry
Methods using a Semiconductor Laser. Particle characterization and identification
is based on detection of forward scatter, fluorescence and adaptive cluster
analysis. Using the same reagents as the XE-2100, the XE-5000 automatically
classifies cells from blood and body fluids and carries out all processes
automatically from aspiration of the sample to outputting the results.

--- Page 2 ---
The body fluid mode analysis mode of the XE-5000 uses the 4DIFF scattergram
and the RBC distribution obtained from a specialized analysis sequence to
calculate and display the WBC (WBC-BF) counts, mononuclear cell
(MN)/polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) counts and percentages, TC-BF (Total
Count) and RBC (RBC-BF) counts found in the body fluid.
Analysis results and graphics are displayed on the IPU screen. They can be
printed on any of the available printers or transmitted to a Host computer.
3. Modes of Operation:
Manual, Capillary, Sampler (Automatic), Manual Closed
4. Specimen Identification:
Specimen information is managed by four menu lists and specimen identification
input is manual (by operator) or by barcode reader.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
There are three modes of specimen sampling: Manual, Capillary, Sampler
(Automatic) and Manual Closed:
Venous blood is mixed with anticoagulant (EDTA 2K, EDTA-3K or EDTA-Na).
Analyze samples within four hours of collection. If it is not possible to analyzed
within four hours samples are refrigerated at 2-8oC until they can be analyzed.
Capillary blood samples are placed directly into diluent to dilute them. No
anticoagulant is used. Alternatively, samples are collected in a microcollection
system, anticoagulant added and then diluted.
6. Calibration:
The manufacturer’s instructions are to be followed for materials and frequency of
calibration. Following installation calibration, it is requested to verify instrument
calibration every six months or on an “as needed “ basis, and maintain good QC
practices, to ensure the accuracy of the system.
7. Quality Control:
The XE-5000 uses a specific control material the e-Check (XE) control.
8. Software:
The role of the software on the XE-2100DC Analyzer is to operate the instrument
in order to analyze whole blood samples, and to way to store and review data.

One of the software programs allows the user to set user-definable flags according
to their laboratory protocol. The XE IPU PIM (Patient Information Manager)
software analyzes the data and works in conjunction with the Windows 2000
operating system, which serves as an administrative function.

G. Intended Use:
1. Indication(s) for Use:
The Sysmex XE-5000 is an automated hematology analyzer for in-vitro
diagnostic use in screening patient populations found in clinical laboratories. The
XE-5000 classifies and enumerates the same parameters as the XE-2100 using
whole blood as described below, cord blood for HPC and has a body fluid mode
for body fluids. The Body Fluid mode analyzes WBC-BF, RBC-BF, MN%/#,
PMN%/# and TC-BF in body fluids (cerebrospinal fluids (CSF), serous fluids,
and synovial fluids with EDTA as needed).

WBC-D on Whole Blood Mode
Seventy-one samples were analyzed to compare the WBC-D on the XE-5000
to the XE-2100. The expected result (+5.0%) is based on samples with WBC
counts >4.0x103/uL. The results are as follows:

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run precision was performed on using CSF, Synovial and Serous fluid
types assayed 10 consecutive times and covered the whole measuring range for
the WBC and RBC parameters. In addition, a precision study was performed
(10 consecutive replicates on several samples) to show that the differential
parameters of the Capillary Mode of the XE-5000 met the performance
specifications at specific mean values for each of the differential parameters.
Results for all studies were within manufacturer specifications.
A precision was also performed to show that the WBC-D parameter (Whole
Blood Mode) met the performance specifications at specific normal mean
value (WBC ≥ 4.0 x103/µL). Within run precision data was collected and ten
consecutive replicates on three normal samples were analyzed on the XE-
5000. Performance was within performance specifications.
c. Linearity:
Linearity was performed on the WBC-BF, RBC-BF and TC-BF parameters by
diluting samples with instrument diluent. Linearity was tested on the
following:
Parameter XE-5000 Body Fluid Ranges
WBC-BF 0.000 – 0.050 x103/μL (within +0.010 x 103/ µL)
0.050 – 10.000 x103/μL (<20%)
RBC-BF 0.000 – 5.000 x106/μL (< 2.0% or within +0.020 x 106/
µL)
TC-BF 0.000 – 0.050 x103/μL (within +0.010 x 103/ µL)
0.050 – 10.000 x103/μL (<20%)

d. Carryover:
Carry-over effect was evaluated by assaying a sample with a high cell count three
consecutive times followed immediately by testing a low count sample consecutively
3 times for WBC-BF, RBC-BF, TC-BF and WBC-DF (Whole Blood Mode). Types
of fluid samples used were CSF, Serous, and Synovial. Performance met
manufacturer’s specifications for all parameters.
e. Interfering Substances:
Results may be compromised with clotted samples and synovial samples that contain
uric acid crystals or have a high viscosity.
Samples results with Errors related to WBC-BF and RBC-BF parameters should not
be used.
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
Stability on Whole Blood
Specimens used to determine sample stability were split into 2 aliquots---one
room temperature (RT) (20-28°C) and the other at low temperature (LT) (4°C).
The separate aliquots were stored at room temperature and low temperature
respectively at baseline (immediately after blood collection), 24, 48, 72 and 96
hours.
Normal samples are stable up to 48 hours at room temperature (20-28°C) and at
low temperature (4°C) for the following parameters: WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT,
MCV, MCH, MCHC, PLT, Neut %, Lymph%, Mono%, Eosin% and Baso%.
