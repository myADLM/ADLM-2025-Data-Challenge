L. Test Principle:
Glucose
This method uses hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase to catalyze the
reaction:
HK
Glucose + ATP -------------------(cid:190) G6P + ADP
G6PDH
G6P + NAD -----------------------(cid:190) 6-Phosphogluconate + NADH + H+
Glucose is phosphorylated with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the reaction
catalyzed by hexokinase (HK). The product, glucose–6-phosphate (G6P) is then
oxidized with the concomitant reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)
to NADH in the reaction catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PDH).
The formation of NADH causes an increase in absorbance at 340nm. The increase is
directly proportional to the amount of glucose in the sample.
The ion selective electrodes develop a voltage that varies with the concentration of
the ion (Na+, K+, Cl-) to which they are specific. The relationship between the
voltage developed and the concentration of the sensed ion is logarithmic and
calculated by the Nernst equation.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The applicant is not making a claim for a glucose calibrator or control but is
recommending the use of an NIST-traceable Glucose Standard (100mg/dl) or
serum calibrator. The glucose studies were conducted using the calibrator
cleared under k810674.
Cleared under Medica EasyElectroLyte/RapidLyte Na/K/Cl Analyzer
(k000926)
d. Detection limit:
Glucose
The lower limit of the reportable range is 1.0 mg/dl, which was defined by the
sponsor as the lowest measurable analyte level with a CV less then or equal to
20%. The studies were conducted for 10 days with two runs per day using
serum sample containing the analyte at 1mg/dl concentration.
The lower limit of the measuring range for the ISE assays was determined
from the linear range study above.

e. Analytical specificity:
The applicant references Young, et al (Young, D.S., et al, Clin. Chem. 21:1D
(1975)) for drugs and substances that may affect glucose values.
The applicant has tested glucose for the following:
Bilirubin to the level of 18 mg/dl has been found to exhibit ≤10% interference
in this assay. Hemoglobin to the level of 250 mg/dl has been found to exhibit
≤10% interference in this assay. Intralipid has been found to exhibit ≤10%
interference in this assay to a level of 300 mg/dl.
The applicant has tested all the ISE assays for the following:
Bilirubin to the level of 20 mg/dl has been found to exhibit ≤10% interference
in this assay. Hemoglobin* to the level of 500 mg/dl has been found to exhibit
≤10% interference in this assay. Intralipid has been found to exhibit ≤10%
interference in this assay to a level of 1000 mg/dl.
* Hemolysis: Hemoglobin had no interference with K+ due to the nature of the
commercial Hemoglobin product having no K+ ion. However, hemolysis will
interfere with K+ due to the high K+ concentration in erythrocytes. The
sponsor has listed this interference in the PI.
