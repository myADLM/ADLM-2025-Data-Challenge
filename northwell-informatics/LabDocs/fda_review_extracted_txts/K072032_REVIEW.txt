L. Test Principle:
Diluted serum samples, calibrator(s), and controls are incubated in microwells coated
with the oxLDL-β GPI complex. Incubation allows the IgG anti-oxLDL-β GPI
2 2
antibody present in the samples to react with the immobilized antigen complex. After
the removal of unbound serum proteins by washing, anti-human IgG antibodies,
labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP), are added forming complexes with the
bound IgG anti-oxLDL-β GPI antibody. Following another washing step, the bound
2
enzyme-antibody conjugate is assayed by the addition of a solution containing
tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and hydrogen peroxide (H O ) as the chromogenic
2 2
substrate. Color develops in the wells at an intensity proportional to the serum
concentration of IgG anti-oxLDL-β GPI antibody. Results are obtained by reading the
2
OD (optical density or absorbance) of each well in a spectrophotometer. Calibrator
sera are provided, with the IgG anti-oxLDL-β GPI antibody concentration expressed
2
in G Units. A log-log regression analysis is performed with calibrator values plotted
against calibrator mean ODs. Controls and patient results are determined from the
calibration curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision: Serum samples with concentrations spanning the range of the assay
were tested in the Corgenix laboratory by 2 operators in duplicate on each of
20 days over 30 calendar days. One reagent lot was tested, and assays were
calibrated each day.
Mean Conc. Inter-assay Within-laboratory
Sample (G Units) Precision (%CV) Precision (%CV)
Low 9.6 3% 13%
Med-Low 20.2 4% 12%
Med 28.1 7% 13%
Med-High 38.4 5% 12%
High 76.8 4% 10%
Reproducibility: Three operators at one site ran three clinical samples (low,
medium, and high) over four consecutive days. The medium and high
samples were run in triplicate and the low was run in quadruplicate. Results
were determined from 48 measurements for the low sample and 36 for the
medium and high sample.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity: Independently duplicate dilutions of a strongly-positive sample,
mixed at various fixed ratios with an IgG-depleted pooled serum, were
prepared to produce 11 evenly-spaced concentrations that were predicted to
extend past the linear range of the assay. Acceptance criterion was set at < 5 G
units between predicted and recovered values. Evaluation of the data
indicated that the linear range of the assay was 10 – 100 G units.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
No recognized reference material for IgG anti-oxLDL-β GPI. The results are
2
reported in arbitrary units.
Controls: The standards are prepared in-house and values are assigned
during the development process. Positive and negative controls are prepared
in-house.
Stability: Calibrators, controls, a sample diluent alone were used to assess
the real-time stability of four kits every 4-6 months for a 24 month period. All
kits were shown to be stable up to 12 months.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB): Three serum samples were mixed and depleted of IgG
using a protein G column. The IgG-depleted serum, four clinical samples, and
a negative sample (sample diluent) were tested multiple times on two different
plate readers. Ninety-two results were generated from the negative samples
and 228 for the clinical samples. The frequency distribution were tabulated
and the 95th percentile of the negative results at 6.1 G units
Limit of Detection (LoD): was defined the lowest level where 5% or fewer of
the observed measurements are below the LoB based on a sample set showing
non-Gaussian distribution. Since none of the results for the positive data set
were at 7.0 G units or below, so the LoD was set as 7 G units.
e. Analytical specificity:
Five clinical samples with the addition of increasing amounts of hemoglobin
(to 500 mg/dL), conjugated bilirubin (to 20 mg/dL), triglycerides (to 3 g/dL),
and rheumatoid factor (to 500 units/ml) were tested and showed that these
levels had no effect on IgG Anti-AtherOx test kit results. However, it is
recommended in the package insert that results obtained from grossly
hemolyzed or lipemic specimens be interpreted with caution and that grossly
lipemic samples can be clarified by centrifugation.
f. Assay cut-off:
A cut-off value of 20 G Units was established by testing 75 serum samples
from healthy volunteers in duplicate. Values ranged from 3.5-17.8 G Units.
Range Mean (Median) 95th Mean + 3
N [G units] [G units] SD percentile SD

arthritis and 205 normal healthy controls were tested for elevated IgG
antiphospholipid antibody levels using the Corgenix IgG Anti-AtherOx and
REAADS IgG anti-cardiolipin kits. Each group is summarized below:
SLE: Serum samples from 143 SLE patients (94 SLE with secondary APS, 19
SLE only and 30 with unknown APS status) were tested on the IgG Anti-
AtherOx™ Test Kit ant the REAADS IgG Anti-Cardiolipin Test. The mean
IgG anti-oxLDL-β GPI antibody level of this group was determined to be 24.4
2
G Units. Of the SLE/APS subgroup, the mean IgG anti-oxLDL- β GPI
2
antibody level was 28.8 G Units. Twenty five SLE/APS samples were positive
when tested with the new device and 17 of these were also positive for anti-
cardiolipin antibodies by the predicate device. Since the new and predicate
devices detect different analytes, it is likely that some patients have one and
not the other autoantibodies. Comparison with the predicate device for the
SLE/APS group is shown below:
