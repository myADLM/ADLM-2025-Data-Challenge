L. Test Principle:
The ARCHITECT iVancomycin assay is a one-step STAT immunoassay for the
quantitative measurement of vancomycin in human serum or plasma using CMIA
technology, with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex. Sample, anti-
vancomycin coated paramagnetic microparticles, and vancomycin acridinium-labeled
conjugate are combined to create a reaction mixture. The anti-vancomycin coated
microparticles bind to vancomycin present in the sample and to the vancomycin
acridinium-labeled conjugate. After washing, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to
the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light
units (RLUs). An indirect relationship exists between the amount of vancomycin in the
sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT i System optics.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Following CLSI EP5-A2, the sponsor evaluated the precision using two lots of
reagents and three levels of Multiconstituent Controls (MCC Level 1, MCC Level 2,
MCC Level 3) and three serum panels prepared by adding vancomycin into a pool of
human sera to obtain desired concentration of vancomycin. Precision tests were run on
two ARCHITECT i systems. Studies were carried out in duplicates of two runs per
day over 20 days (total of 80 data points). The sponsor’s acceptance was designed to
maintain ≤10% total CV. The results are tabulated below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor conducted studies on the T60 instrument to evaluate the dilution
recovery of the ARCHITECT iVancomycin assay using CLSI Document EP6-A as a
guideline. The sponsor used five pooled frozen serum samples (Vancomycin values:
40-86 μg /mL) and a calibrator (Calibrator F: 105 μg/mL) diluted manually with both
ARCHITECT iVancomycin Calibrator A and ARCHITECT Multi-assay manual
diluent. Each of the five samples was diluted to maintain 11 test concentration levels
separately using Calibrator A and multi-assay diluent. Testing was done using one
reagent lot and running duplicates of each diluent level. The results demonstrated at
each dilution level for all five samples, and for both Calibrator A and ARCHITECT
Multi-assay manual diluent, diluted sample values recovered from 98% to 117%.
Based on the recovery data and the limit of detection described below, the sponsor
established the assay reportable range for ARCHITECT iVancomycin assay as 0.24
μg/mL – 100.00 μg/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor provides calibrator materials and recommends using commercially
available control materials for quality control procedure. The sponsor provided the
protocols for preparation and value assignment for calibrators. The Internal Standard
Calibrators are manufactured gravimetrically using purified synthetic Vancomycin
from the US Pharmacopeia (USP) Reference Standard Vancomycin (Ref. 1709007).
The ARCHITECT iVancomycin Calibrators are matched to the Internal Standard
Calibrators, which consists of calibrator buffer (MES, Dextrose and ProClin
300), Vancomycin and stabilizer.
The sponsor conducted all stability studies including accelerated stability studies for
long-term storage. The sponsor’s studies demonstrated the following limits: open-vial
stability of 4 months; long-term storage of 8 months; and on-board stability of 30
days. The assay labeling indicates that when the reagent is stored and handled as
directed, the reagents are stable until expiration date on the bottle.

d. Limit of Detection:
To demonstrate the lower limit of the assay range, the sponsor performed the limit of
detection (LOD) and limit of blank (LOB) tests using CLSI document EP17-A
“Protocol for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation;
Approved Guideline” The sponsor used 2 instruments, 2 lots of reagents and 2 lots of
calibrators for testing on a panel of 4 samples with low vancomycin concentrations
and a sample (NHS) with 0 μg/mL. The samples with vancomycin were prepared by
diluting low vancomycin serum sample (11.6μg/mL) with NHS sample to achieve
concentrations of 1.0, 1.5, 2 and 2.5 μg/mL. Three runs were performed for each
reagent lot. Each run consisted of 20 replicates of NHS (0 μg/mL) and 5 replicates of
each panel member for a total of 60 replicates of NHS and 15 replicates of each panel
member were analyzed. Based on the 95th percentile calculation described in the
CLSI EP17-A, LOD was determined using the algorithm, LoD = LoB + [1.645 / (1 -
1 / 4 x df)] σS. The mean LOB and LOD were determined as 0.12 μg/mL and 0.24
μg/mL, respectively.
e. Analytical specificity:
Following instructions in CLSI document EP7-A2, the sponsor evaluated the effect of
known endogenous interferents on Architect i System using one lot of reagents. The
interferents and the test range included triglycerides (2500 mg/dL), hemoglobin (500
mg/dL), low protein (3 g/dL), high protein (10 g/dL), HAMA (1000 ng/mL),
rheumatoid factor 500 IU/mL, and bilirubin (20 mg/dL). Five human serum samples
with Vancomycin concentrations targeted at 5, 10, 25, 40 and 80 μg/mL were used to
prepare the interfering panel. These human serum samples were spiked with the
interferent for the test sample. An equal volume of interferent diluent was spiked into
the samples to prepare the control sample. The results are listed in the table below.
The sponsor claimed no interference with recovery ± 15% for the above interferents
and up to the concentrations tested.

* Sample 1 when diluted had an initial concentration of Vancomycin less than
2μg/mL, less than the designed LoD of the assay. An additional sample 6 target at
15μg/mL was added to the data set.
Following CLSI EP7-A2 guidelines, the sponsor conducted a study to evaluate the
potential cross-reactivity of the ARCHITECT iVancomycin assay when tested with
structurally similar compounds. A pool of sera containing essentially no residual
vancomycin was split into 3 different parts. Two parts were spiked with vancomycin
to reach target concentrations of 7 and 35 μg/mL and the third part was not spiked
with vancomycin. Therapeutic interferents listed in the table below were dissolved at
concentrations 20 times greater than the desired testing concentrations. Therapeutic
concentrates were spiked into the samples above to prepare the test sample and an
equal volume of the interferent diluent was spiked to the samples to prepare the
control sample. Each sample was tested in three replicates. Based on these studies,
the sponsor demonstrated when there is no vancomycin present, all tested therapeutics
have no potential cross-reactivity above the LOD. In the presence of vancomycin, no
influence from tested therapeutics was observed based on the criteria, change in
vancomycin measured should be less than the designed LOD of the assay and the
mean % Recovery of Vancomycin is 100 +/- 10%.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To demonstrate the substantial equivalence to the predicate device, the sponsor
conducted a method comparison study with samples using ARCHITECT
iVancomycin Reagent on ARCHITECT i System and Abbott AxSYM Vancomycin II.
Using a total of 206 frozen serum samples (range: 0-100 μg/mL) (86 samples were
spiked to achieve concentrations of 40-100 μg/mL, 120 natural samples ranged from
0-40 μg/mL), the study was performed over 4 days, generating calibration curves on
each testing day. Samples that fell within the measuring range for each assay were
used for calculations. A total of 192 samples were used for calculations. The analysis
of data using Passing & Bablok and least squares method produced regression
equations y = 0.9249x + 0.0502 and y = 0.9016x + 0.7905. The following table
demonstrates the correlation between the two methods. Fourteen samples were not
included in the analysis because they were below the detection limit.

A bias analysis of ARCHITECT iVancomycin vs AxSYM Vancomycin II performed
on the same 192 specimens (2.1 to 94.3 μg/Ml) exhibited an average bias of –7.29%
(95% CI: -23.40 to 8.82%). Within the typical therapeutic range of vancomycin
therapy (5-40 μg/mL), the average bias was -4.41% (95% CI: -19.51 to 10.70%).
b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor conducted matrix comparison studies using 20 matched serum and
plasma samples prepared with five different anticoagulants (K-EDTA, Na-Citrate,
Na- Fluoride/K-Oxalate, Na-Heparin and Li-Heparin) used for plasma. Serum tubes
without anticoagulants were used as the control. To evaluate the anticoagulant effect
along the assay measuring range, each of the 20 sets of serum/plasma tubes were
spiked with vancomycin to obtain 10 different spiking concentrations. (5, 7.5, 10, 15,
20, 30, 40, 60, 70 and 80 μg/mL). The samples were analyzed in triplicate with one
lot of ARCHITECT iVancomycin reagents on the ARCHITECT i System. Based on
the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of mean % recovery value within 100 ± 10% of the
serum value, data tabulated below supports the plasma can be used to determine the
vancomycin level in blood.

5. Expected values/Reference range*:
In the labeling, the sponsor states, as supported by literature, therapeutic peak serum
levels of 20 to 40 μg/mL and trough levels of 5 to 10 μg/mL have been reported to be
effective for most strains of staphylococci and streptococci. The sponsor recommends
in the labeling that users establish the therapeutic levels of vancomycin based on
patient differences and bacterial susceptibility. For diagnostic purposes, the test
findings should always be assessed in conjunction with the patient’s medical history,
clinical examinations, and other findings.
