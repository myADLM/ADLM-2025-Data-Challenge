3. Special condition for use statement(s):
The VITEK 2 AST cards cannot be used with direct clinical specimens or
other sources containing mixed flora. Any change or modification in the
procedure may affect the results.
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
Each VITEK® 2 test card contains 64 microwells. A control well, that contains
only microbiological culture medium is resident on all cards, with the remaining
wells containing pre measured amounts of a specific antibiotic combined with
culture medium. A suspension of organism is made in 0.45-0.5% sterile saline
from a pure culture and standardized to a McFarland 0.5 standard using the
DensiChek Turbidity meter. The desired cards are placed in the cassette along
with an empty tube for the susceptibility card. The cassette is placed into the
VITEK® 2 instrument where a susceptibility test will be automatically diluted
from the ID suspension by the Vitek® 2. (275 microliter/2.5ml for manual
inoculations and 235 microliter/2.5 ml saline for gram positive cocci.). The cards
are then automatically vacuum filled; the tubes are cut and the cards sealed prior
to proceeding to the Incubator Loading Station. Cards are then transferred from
the cassette into the carousel for incubation (35.5o C) and optical scanning during
testing. Readings are performed every 15 minutes.

(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S16) “Methods
for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard”
L. Test Principle:
Optics systems use visible light to directly measure organism growth. These
transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant
growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure
organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through the well. An
interpretive call is made between four and 16 hours with the majority of the S.
pneumoniae between five and nine hours. The VITEK Susceptibility Card test is
based on the microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration technique with
concentrations equivalent to standard method concentrations. Several parameters
based on the growth characteristics observed are used to provide appropriate input
for the MIC calculations. Discriminate analysis is used to develop the algorithm that
determines the susceptibility result for all antimicrobials on the VITEK 2 system.
The MIC result must be linked to an organism identification in order to determine a
category interpretation. A category interpretation will be reported along with a MIC.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
An external evaluation was conducted with fresh and stock clinical isolates and
challenge strains. The external evaluations were designed to confirm the
acceptability of VITEK 2 Gram Negative Levofloxacin by comparing its
performance with the CLSI broth microdilution reference method.
This submission is for the AST Panel only. The ID System was not reviewed.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using a panel of 48 gram-negative
isolates in triplicate, each for three days at three sites with VITEK 2
AST-GN Levofloxacin.
All results were > 95 % reproducible for both dilutions methods.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
The recommended QC isolates were tested by VITEK 2 AST cards
containing Levofloxacin, and broth microdilution plates containing
Levofloxacin. QC organisms Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were tested at each clinical trial
site. The VITEK 2 was tested a sufficient number of times to
demonstrate that the system can produce QC results in the recommended
range > 95% of the time. The following tables provide the frequency of
the results in each concentration at each of the three testing sites for the
manual and the auto dilution reading methods.

* VITEK 2 Card Result Range
E. coli ATCC 25922 QC performance: The device dilutions present on
the VITEK 2 card produced QC results which were outside the expected
result range. Therefore, a secondary QC isolate, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa ATCC 27853, which produced on scale results was also tested.
The mode of the Reference result were one dilution lower than the mode
of the device results.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 QC performance: The modes
for the VITEK 2 results were the same as the reference methods for both
reading methods. No QC trending was observed.
Inoculum density control: A turbidity meter was used (DensiCheck) for
the turbidity inoculation method. DensiChek Calibration verification
procedure was also included.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical testing was conducted at 3 sites. The new formulation
and new algorithm testing included 596 clinical isolates of which
200 were fresh, along with a challenge set with known results.
Two methods of inoculation (manual and automated) were
evaluated by both VITEK 2 AST-GN Levofloxacin and agar
dilution containing Levofloxacin. All isolates with the exception of
1 grew in the VITEK 2 AST-GN card in <16 hours. A panel of 95
organisms were used for Challenge testing at one site. Each
challenge organism was tested one time by manual dilution,
automatic dilution, and agar dilution. A comparison was provided
to the reference method with the following agreement.

The performance characteristics of the antimicrobial agents included
in VITEK 2 AST cards were established using the manual and auto
dilution modes at multiple clinical laboratories. The VITEK 2 AST
card results were compared to results from a reference method
prepared according to CLSI. Essential Agreement (EA) represents
VITEK 2 results which agree exactly with the Reference method or
are within a +/- one two-fold dilution of the reference result.
Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the VITEK 2 and the
reference interpretative result agree as Susceptible, Intermediate, and
Resistant (S-I-R) exactly.
Clinical testing and challenge testing demonstrated one very major
discrepancy (vmj), the test was Sensitive and the reference was
Resistant. And only one major discrepancy (maj), the test was
Resistant and the reference as Sensitive. A combined two minor
errors were also recorded. A combined EA of 98.6% and CA of
95.8 % are both acceptable. The test device had a growth rate of
>95%
