systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus.
L. Test Principle:
The glucose oxidase and potassium ferrocyanide in the strip react with the glucose in the
sample to produce an electrical current which is proportional to the amount of glucose in the
sample. The meter measures the current and converts it to the corresponding glucose
concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was performed using CLSI EP5-A: Evaluation of Precision Performance of
Clinical Chemistry Devices. Three levels of samples were used to establish precision
of the assay on blood samples. Each sample was analyzed on 5 Bionime glucose
meters with each meter tested 10 times, for a total of 50 measurements:
Blood Sample 1 2 3

Five levels of control materials over the claimed assay range were used to establish
total precision of the assay. Each control solution was analyzed on 5 Bionime glucose

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the device was demonstrated by comparing 14 prepared whole blood
samples on the Rightest and a glucose reference method; each level was tested in
quadruplicate by two lots of test strips. The 14 samples covered the claimed clinical
range of the meter (23.5 – 570 mg/dL). Analysis of the results showed a linear
relationship between the Rightest and the reference method: Lot 1 y = 0.987x – 4.2,
R2 = 0.999, Lot 2 y = 0.987x – 4.9, R2 = 0.999. The reportable range of the Rightest
meter is 20 - 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The control materials supplied for this device were cleared under k012431. The
sponsor established traceability to a reference method in k042678.
d. Detection limit:
20 mg/dL: see linearity studies above. For values below 20 mg/dL the meter reads
‘LO”.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor tested the following exogenous and endogenous substances for
interference using two levels of glucose. The results are summarized below:

The sponsor evaluated the effect of hematocrit levels 20 – 70% on whole blood
samples spiked with eight hematocrit levels for three levels of glucose (low (40-70
mg/dL), medium (110-200 mg/dL) and high (200-400mg/dL). The values generated
were compared with the glucose values from a reference method. Based on the
deviation for glucose concentrations versus 40% hematocrit, the data supports the
sponsor’s claimed range of hematocrit levels between 30-55%. The results are
summarized below.
An altitude study was performed with spiked whole blood samples at low (30-50
mg/dL), medium (80-120 mg/dL), and high concentrations (240-360 mg/dL) and

b. Matrix comparison:
This system is cleared for use with fingerstick, palm, and forearm capillary whole
blood samples. The meter’s software adjusts the whole-blood glucose reading to a
plasma-equivalent reading.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
See method comparison section above.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The sponsor provided a readability study that indicated that the user manual, strip
labeling, and control solutions are at an 8th grade reading level.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The normal fasting adult glucose range for a non-diabetic listed by the sponsor is 70 – 99
mg/dL. Referenced from Diabetes Information - American Association for Clinical
Chemistry (AACC) (Electronic Version).
N. Instrument Name:
Bionime Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm, or
forearm only. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are
no special handling or storage issues.

5. Calibration:
A Smart Code Key is provided with each batch of test strips to calibrate the meter for that
batch. No further calibrations are required of the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor provides a single level of glucose control solution with this device. A second
level of control solution is available for purchase but is not included in the kit.
When the Check Key is inserted into the meter, the control mode is activated. This
prevents control results from being stored in the internal memory. An acceptable range
for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is referred to the
troubleshooting section of the User’s Manual if control results fall outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Not applicable.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
