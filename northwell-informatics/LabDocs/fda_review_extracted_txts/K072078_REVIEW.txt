phosphate dihydrate with polyethylene glycol and preservative (sodium azide). R2 is
a suspension of polystyrene latex particles of uniform size coated with the IgG
fraction of rabbit anti-human Beta-2-microglobulin specific serum with preservative
(sodium azide).
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
Predicate: IL Test Beta-2-Microglobulin K943686
Similarities:
The Quantia Beta-2 Microglobulin and the IL Test Beta-2-Microglobulin are both
manufactured by Biokit and are both intended for the quantitative in vitro diagnostic
determination of beta-2-microglubulin. They also use the same methodology: Particle
Enhanced Immunoturbidimetry.
The Quantia Beta-2 Microglobulin and the IL Test Beta-2- Microglobulin, have the same
composition: Latex Reagent Suspension of polystyrene latex particles coated with rabbit
IgG anti-human Beta-2 Microglobulin in a buffer containing bovine serum albumin and <
0.1 % w/w sodium azide; and
Reaction Buffer Phosphate buffer 40mM containing bovine serum albumin and sodium
azide < 0.1 % w/w.
Differences:
Specimen type: both assays can use serum and urine as samples. They differ in the
plasma types. The device can use EDTA and the predicate can use EDTA and sodium
heparin.

L. Test Principle:
When a sample containing Beta-2 Microglobulin is mixed with the reagent, a clear
agglutination occurs which can be measured by turbidimetry. Results are expressed
in mg/L of Beta-2-microglobulin based on the 1st WHO International Standard (B2M)
established in 1985.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
CLSI EP5-A was followed.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was assessed according to CLSI EP6-A. The overall reportable
range for serum, plasma and urine is 0.025 to 96 mg/L. The assay was linear
from 0.025 to 1.6 mg/L (the reportable range for urine samples) with the
automatic rerun capability (Dilution Protocol 2); from 0.25 to 16 mg/L
without the automatic rerun capability; and from16 to 96 mg/L with the
automatic rerun capability (Dilution Protocol 1).
Prozone
The manufacturer was asked to run a sample higher than 114 mg/L to
demonstrate the instrument give a result of >16 mg/L. They tested samples
from 80.4 to 200.9 mg/L. In all cases the instrument gave a result of > 96
(serum linearity upper limit) and triggered the Dilution Protocol 1. The assay
did not demonstrate prozone effect with specimens up to 200 mg/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The assay calibrators are standardized against WHO reference material B2M.
Stability of the reagents was established at 19 months by testing 4 different
lots. Reagents should be stored at 2-8°C.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of quantitation (LOQ) was defined as the minimum quantity of
analyte that can be measured with a within-run CV below 20% and an error
below 20%. The LOQ for the assay was determined to be 0.25 mg/L without
the automatic rerun capability and 0.025 mg/L with the automatic rerun
capability for serum, plasma and urine. This was established by running serial
dilutions of the 4 mg/L calibrator. Through 0.025 mg/L the %CV ranged
from 1.0 to 5.5% and error ranged from 3.8 to 9.3%.
The limit of detection (LOD) was defined as the mean reported value + 2SD
for a sample free of analyte. The LOD was determined to be 0.046 mg/L
without the rerun capability and 0.025 mg/L (LOQ) with the automatic rerun
capability.
e. Analytical specificity:
CLSI guideline EP7-A was followed.
Substance tested Concentration (mg/dL) Outcome
Conjugated bilirubin 20.9 No interference
Ascorbic acid 20 Interference below 10%
Hemoglobin 23.6 Interference below 10%
Protein (IgG) 100 No interference
Urine pH showed no significant positive or negative influence on the result.
