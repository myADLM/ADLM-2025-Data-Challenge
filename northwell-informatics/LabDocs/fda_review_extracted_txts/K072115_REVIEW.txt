L. Test Principle:
ABX PENTRA Creatinine 120 CP reagent: Creatinine reacts with alkaline picrate to
produce a reddish component (Jaffé reaction). The red color obtained, which is
measured at 500 nm by spectrophotometry is directly proportional to the creatinine
concentration present in the sample.
ABX PENTRA Total Protein 100 CP: The peptide bonds of protein react with the
copper II ions in alkaline solution to form a blue-violet complex ( the biuret reaction),
each copper ion complexing with 5 or 6 peptides bonds (2). Tartrate is added as a
stabilizer while iodide is used to prevent auto-reduction of the alkaline copper
complex. The color formed is proportional to the protein concentration and is
measured at 520-560 nm.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor conducted linearity studies in accordance with CLSI EP6-A. For ABX
PENTRA Creatinine 120 CP reagent for serum samples, the sponsor used an in house
preparation of aqueous creatinine solution diluted to generate 11 concentrations (mean
values of the range 0.228 – 28.492 mg/dL). The sponsor’s acceptance criterion for the
bias with linearity is ± 8%. Each test level was run in four repeats on Pentra 400
analyzer. Based on a linear regression analysis conducted for measured and assigned
values, the assay was shown to be linear within the entire range tested. Based on these
results as well as Limit of detection studies below, the sponsor established the assay
reportable range for serum/plasma at 0.18 – 22.60 mg/dL. The sponsor also conducted
post dilution linear range studies to establish serum values above the upper limit of
22.60 mg/dL. The goal of this study was to compare manual dilution with the
automatic dilution performed by the Pentra 400. Based on the sponsors’ internal
acceptance criteria of ± 10% recovery (manual vs. automatic dilution), the sponsor
established the upper limit of 67.8 mg/dL for the extended range.
The sponsor conducted a similar study for ABX PENTRA Creatinine 120 CP reagent
for urine samples using an in house preparation (concentration range: 5.20 – 362.84
mg/dL) and each of the 11 concentration level tested in four repeats. Based on a linear
regression analysis conducted for measured and assigned values, the assay was shown
to be linear within the entire range tested. Based on these results as well as Limit of
detection studies below, the sponsor established the assay reportable range for urine at
1.39 – 282.50 mg/dL. The sponsor also conducted post dilution linear range studies to
establish urine values above the upper limit of 282.50 mg/dL. The goal of this study
was to compare manual dilution with the automatic dilution performed by the Pentra
400. Based on the sponsors’ internal acceptance criteria of ± 10% recovery (manual vs.
automatic dilution), the sponsor established the upper limit of 857.5 mg/dL for the
extended range.
The sponsor conducted similar study for ABX PENTRA Total Protein 100 CP reagent
for serum using an in house sera preparation diluted to generate 11 concentrations
(mean values of the range 0.997 – 11.678 g/dL) with each concentration level tested in
four repeats. Based on a linear regression analysis conducted for measured and
assigned values, and in accordance with the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of the bias
within ± 4%, the assay was shown to be linear within the entire range tested. Based on
these results as well as Limit of detection studies below, the sponsor established the
assay reportable range for serum total protein at 0.1 – 10.0 g/dL. The sponsor also
conducted post dilution linear range studies to establish serum total protein values
above the upper limit of 10 g/dL. The goal of this study was to compare manual
dilution with the automatic dilution performed by the Pentra 400. Based on the
sponsors’ internal acceptance criteria of ± 10% recovery (manual vs. automatic
dilution), the sponsor established the upper limit of 20.0 g/dL for the extended range.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrators and controls used in this submission are previously cleared. The
creatinine and total protein material introduced in to the calibrators and their
6

--- Page 7 ---
corresponding values are traceable to reference material SRM909b and
SRM927C/Verichem 9460, respectively. The assigned value is the median of all the
values generated for each calibrator and control. Additionally, control range is
calculated as the target value ± 3 standard deviations. Please refer to the value
assignment sheet in the labeling for lot-specific values.
The sponsor conducted stability studies for the reagents and calibrators and controls.
Based on the acceptance criteria of the material recovery is within target value ± 10%,
the sponsor claims shelf life of 24 months, open-vial stability of 4 months, and on-
board stability of 10 days for ABX PENTRA Creatinine 120 CP reagent. For ABX
PENTRA Total Protein 100 CP reagent, the sponsor claims shelf life of 26 months and
on-board stability of 14 days. To ensure adequate quality control, the sponsor
recommends calibrating the test everyday and every time a new reagent bottle is used.
The sponsor also recommends using quality control samples at least once a day, after
each calibration and when a new bottle is used. However, the sponsor also suggests
the control intervals must be adapted to the individual laboratory requirement.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor evaluated Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Blank (LoB) for ABX
PENTRA Creatinine 120 CP reagent for serum and urine samples and ABX PENTRA
Total Protein 100 CP reagent for serum on Pentra 400 instrument following the
guidelines in CLSI EP17-A. Results were evaluated for Gaussian distribution and
LoB values generated using parametric procedure. LoB was determined using
physiological water (0.9% NaCl) assayed 201 (Creatinine 120 CP reagent for serum),
120 (Creatinine 120 CP reagent for urine), and 60 (Total Protein 100 CP reagent for
serum) times on 3 Pentra 400 instruments with the method in evaluation. The LoB
values were, 0.106 mg/dL, 0.01 mg/dL, and -0.008 g/dL, respectively.
To determine the LoD, the sponsor used four samples with concentrations between
LoB and LoB x 5 and assayed 20 times. Results were evaluated for Gaussian
distribution and LoD values generated using parametric procedure. LoD values for
Pentra 400 instrument were, 0.177 mg/dL for Creatinine 120 CP reagent for serum,
1.39 mg/dL for Creatinine 120 CP reagent for urine, and 0.01 g/dL for Total Protein
100 CP reagent for serum.
e. Analytical specificity:
For ABX PENTRA Creatinine 120 CP reagent for serum and urine, the sponsor
evaluated the effect of hemoglobin (0-259 mg/dL), direct bilirubin (0 – 26 mg/dL),
total bilirubin (0-33 mg/dL), lipemia (intralipid) (0-613 mg/dL), glucose (15 g/L) and
total protein (122 g/L) on pooled sera at two creatinine concentrations (low and high)
spiked with the interferents, and then compared with unspiked control. Based on the
sponsor-defined interference limit of ± 10% of control, the following interference limit
claims were set by the sponsor for each reagent set.

mg/dL for the ABX PENTRA Creatinine 120 CP reagent and 70 samples ranging from
1.30 g/dL to 9.81 g/dL for the ABX PENTRA Total Protein 100 CP reagent using
PENTRA 400 analyzer. Linear regression analysis for ABX PENTRA Creatinine 120
CP reagent yielded linear regression equations for lithium-heparin (y = 0.971x +0.032;
r = 0.999) and EDTA plasma (y = 0.976x +0.032; r = 0.997). The sponsor claimed no
significant differences between serum and plasma. Similarly, for ABX PENTRA Total
Protein 100 CP reagent linear regression analysis yielded linear regression equations
for lithium-heparin (y = 0.953x +0.117; r = 0.999) and EDTA plasma (y = 0.977x -
0.1586; r = 0.991). The sponsor claimed no significant differences between serum and
plasma.
