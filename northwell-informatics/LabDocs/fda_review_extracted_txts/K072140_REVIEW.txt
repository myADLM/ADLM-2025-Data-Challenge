I. Device Description:
The S40 Clinical Analyzer is an automatic wet chemistry system intended for use in
clinical laboratories or physician office laboratories that consists of a desktop
analyzer, an operation screen that prompts the user for operation input and displays
data, a unit cover, and disposable reagent cartridges. The desktop analyzer includes a
single pipettor, an incubation, and a multi-wavelength photometer.
The S-Test Total Bilirubin Reagent measures bilirubin, a product of hemoglobin
degradation in the cells of the reticuloendothelial system. The bilirubin formed is
transported to the liver where it is conjugated with glucuronic acid and secreted in the
bile. Total serum bilirubin is the sum of unconjugated (free or indirect) and conjugat-
ed (direct) bilirubin. Total bilirubin levels are measured using the enzyme bilirubin
oxidase.
The S-Test BUN Reagent measures urea, the most common nitrogen containing end-
product of protein catabolism, normally excreted rapidly by the kidneys. The test
uses the enzyme urease (urea amidohydrolase) to break down urea into ammonia and
carbon dioxide, followed by analysis for NADPH.
The S-Test Glucose Reagent measures glucose. Glucose is the transport form of
carbohydrate in the body and is used by all cells as a source of energy. The S40
Assay is an enzymatic method analyzing the resulting level of NADPH.

Laboratory; Approved Guideline-Second Edition (2000), Section 8.2: Transference
and Validation
L. Test Principle:
S Test BUN - In the presence of urease, urea in serum is hydrolyzed to yield
ammonia (NH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The ammonia formed then reacts with α
-ketoglutaric acid and NADPH in the presence of glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH)
to yield glutamatic acid and NADP. The rate of decrease in absorbance of NADPH,
monitored bichromatically at 340 nm/405 nm, is directly proportional to the
concentration of urea in the sample.
S Test BIL - Total bilirubin in the sample is oxidized into biliverdine by the action of
bilirubin oxidase (BOD) at pH 7-8, which causes the absorbance at 450 nm to
decrease. The total bilirubin concentration in the sample is determined by measuring
this absorbance decrease. The rate of decrease in absorbance, monitored
bichromatically at 450 nm/546 nm, is directly proportional to the amount of bilirubin
in the sample.
S Test GLU - Glucose in serum reacts with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the
presence of hexokinase (HK) and magnesium with the formation of glucose-6-
phosphate (G-6-P) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) catalyzes the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate with
NADP to form 6-phosphogluconate and NADPH. NADPH absorbs strongly at 340
nm, whereas NADP does not. The total amount of NADPH formed is proportional to
the initial amount of glucose present. The rate of increase in absorbance, monitored
bichromatically at 340 nm/450 nm, is directly proportional to the glucose
concentration in the sample.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
BUN
The reportable ranges are 4.9 to 75.7 mg/dL for BUN, 0.2 to 26.6 mg/dL for
BIL, and 18 to 472 mg/dL for GLU. This range is supported by the limit of
detection study (section M.1.d below), the method comparison (section M.2.a
below), and the linearity shown below.
Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by testing commercial
linearity standards, 6-8 levels each with known commercial concentrations of
BUN, BIL, GLU. The assigned value of the highest sample was set to its
mean value. The assigned values of the other levels were calculated by
multiplying the mean value by the ratios obtained from the manufacturer.
Each level was tested in replicates of four. Results are presented below:

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank and Limit of Detection was determined for each analyte
by running a low sample and true blank sample for 3 days, 20 replicates/day
for a total of 60 results. The testing was split between two instruments. The
limits of detection are 4.9 mg/dL BUN, 0.2 mg/dL BIL, and 18 mg/dL GLU.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies to determine the effects of Unconjugated Bilirubin,
Hemolysis and Lipemia were performed. The sponsor states that interference
is considered to be significant if the analyte recovery changes by more than
10%.
BUN
Assay performance claims have been established on the S40 Clinical Analyzer
by testing a serum pool containing approximately 19 mg/dL BUN to the
following concentrations of each interferent: Unconjugated Bilirubin - 50
mg/dL; Hemolysis - 1000 mg/dL; Lipemia (Intralipid) - 2000 mg/dL.
Bilirubin: No significant interference to 25 mg/dL. Positive interference (>75
mg/dL BUN result) at 50 mg/dL.
Hemolysis: Positive interference (~11-13%) at 31, 63, 125 and 250 mg/dL.
Any level of hemolysis may cause interference. Do not use hemolyzed
specimens.
Lipemia (Intralipid): No significant interference was observed.
BIL
Assay performance claims have been established on the S40 Clinical Analyzer
by testing a serum pool containing approximately 0.6 mg/dL bilirubin to the
following concentrations of each interferent: Hemolysis - 1000 mg/dL;
Triglycerides (Intralipid) - 2000 mg/dL.
Hemolysis: Positive interference (≥ 50%) occurred at 125 mg/dL and above.
Lipemia (Intralipid): Positive interference (>58%) occurred at 500 mg/dL and
above.
GLU
