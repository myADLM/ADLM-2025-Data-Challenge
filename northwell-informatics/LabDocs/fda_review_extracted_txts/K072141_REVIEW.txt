L. Test Principle:
S Test IP – Inorganic Phosphorous in a sample under acidic conditions reacts with
ammonium molybdate to form an unreduced phosphomolybdate complex. The rate of
increase in absorbance at 600 nm/700 nm is directly proportional to phosphorous
concentration in the sample.
S Test UA – Uric Acid in a sample is oxidized by uricase to allantoin and hydrogen
peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide oxidizes and condenses 4-aminoantipyrine and n-
ethyl-N-(2-hydroxy-3-sulopropyl)-m-touluidine under the influence of peroxidase to
produce a reddish-purple pigment. The rate of increase at absorbance at 600/800 nm,
is directly proportional to the uric acid concentration in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted in-house and at three Physician Office
Laboratories (POL) (with three trained operators typically found in these
settings) by testing three serum samples. The samples were run once a day,
three times per run for five days using one instrument at each site. The results
are presented below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by testing commercial
linearity standards with 5 levels each with known concentrations of IP and
UA. Each level was tested in replicates of four. Results are presented below:
Inorganic Phosphorous
Sample Assigned Value mg/dL Measured Value mg/dL % Recovery
1 0.71 0.90 +0.2 mg/dL
2 2.84 3.35 +0.5 mg/dL
3 5.67 5.70 100.5%
4 7.09 7.63 +0.5 mg/dL
5 9.93 9.93 100%
Linear regression y = 0.9739x + 0.366, r2 = 0.9928
Uric Acid
1 0.92 0.90 98%
2 2.76 2.70 98%
3 4.22 3.48 -0.7 mg/dL%
4 6.79 6.30 -0.5 mg/dL
5 11.64 11.35 98%
6 16.49 16.03 97%
7 20.39 20.38 100%
Linear regression y = 1.005x – 0.264, r2 = 0.9984
The reportable range is 1.2–9.9 mg/dL for Inorganic Phosphorous (IP) and
1.4-20.4 mg/dL for Uric Acid (UA).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The S Test IP and S Test UA cartridges are factory calibrated and traceable to
the NIST standard Reference materials 200a and 913a respectively. The 2-D
barcode printed on each cartridge provides the analyzer with lot-specific
calibration data.
Real time stability studies have been conducted. Protocols and acceptance
criteria were described and found to be acceptable. When stored at 2-8 ºC the
assay reagent is good until the expiration date.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank and Limit of Detection were determined for each analyte
by running a low sample and saline sample for 3 days, 20 replicates/day for a
total of 60 results. The testing was split between two instruments. The limits
of detection were determined to be 1.2 mg/dL for inorganic phosphorus and
1.4 mg/dL for uric acid.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies to determine the effects of Unconjugated Bilirubin,
Hemolysis and Lipemia were performed. Seven serum pools containing
approximately 3.6 mg/dL IP and 4.8 mg/dL UA were spiked with various
concentrations of unconjugated bilirubin (0-50 mg/dL), hemoglobin (0-1000
mg/dL) and Intralipids (0-2000 mg/dL). Sponsor states that interference is
considered to be significant if the analyte result is different from the control
by + 10%.
IP – There was no significant interference from bilirubin. No significant
interference of lipemia at concentration of 63,125 and 250 mg/dl. There was a
positive interference of (>17%) at 500 mg/dL and above. Hemoglobin testing
showed a positive interference (>14%) at all levels. The sponsor states that
users should not use hemolyzed specimens.
UA - There was no significant interference from bilirubin. A positive
interference at any level of hemoglobin was observed. The sponsor states that
users should not use hemolyzed specimens. Intralipid of 250 mg/dL and above
may cause interference. There was a positive interference of (>14%) at 500
mg/dL and above.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical correlation studies were performed comparing the S-Test IP and UA
results generated on the S40 Clinical analyzer against the results from the
ACE Clinical analyzer using 95 IP and 183 UA serum samples. Of the 95 IP
samples (77 were unaltered clinical patient samples, 9 were dilutes and 9 were
spiked samples) and 183 UA samples (143 were unaltered clinical patient
samples, 16 were dilutes and 24 were spiked samples). All the samples were
measure in singlet.
The correlation study between the device and the predicate for yielded the
following results.

S Test IP 95 1.088 0.16 0.976 1.1-8.9

--- Page 8 ---
Performance for the S Test IP and S Test UA was evaluated at three Physician
Office Laboratories with a total of three operators who are typical operators at
these sites. Operators ran for IP 40-41 unaltered clinical serum samples, site
one also ran 8 diluted and 7 spiked, site 2 ran 8 diluted and 9 spiked and site 3
ran 8 diluted and 8 spiked samples. The UA assay all sites ran 40 unaltered
clinical samples, site 1 additional ran 9 diluted and 5 spiked, site 2 ran 8
diluted and 8 spiked and site 3 ran 8 dilutes and 6 spiked samples. The S Test
IP and UA test results were compared to the ACE results. The correlation
study between the device and the predicate for serum yielded the following
results.

Lab C 54 1.085 -0.18 0.967 2.8-14.7
b. Matrix comparison:
A serum / plasma comparison test was performed for the S-Test IP and S-Test
UA assays. Thirty- three paired IP and thirty-two paired UA samples were
assayed on the S40 System. The IP comparison eight of the samples were
spiked and one sample was diluted, and the UA comparison had 8 spiked
samples to help cover the assay range. The correlation is as follows:
IP y = 1.043x - 0.08, r = 0.996, range 1.2-9.5 mg/dL
UA y = 1.052 – 0.21, r = 0.9975, range 1.7-17.1 mg/dL

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Eighty-one (81) normal serum samples for IP and UA were evaluated on the S40
Clinical Analyzer to determine if the reference ranges of the predicate (ACE
Clinical Analyzer) could be transferred to the new assays. The sponsors’
acceptance criterion is 90% of the assay results for the normal samples are within
the predicate range. Analysis confirmed sufficient agreement (9.9% IP and 2.4%
UA non-congruent results, sponsor specification <10%) to transfer the reference
range.
IP – 2.7-4.5 mg/dL
UA – 2.6-7.2 mg/dL (3.5-7.2 male and 2.6-6.0 female)
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
