L. Test Principle:
S Test ALP – Alkaline Phosphatase in the sample catalyzes the cleavage of p-
nitrophenylphosphate substrate to form the visible product, p-nitrophenyl which is
measured spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. The rate of increase in absorbance is
directly proportional to the alkaline phosphatase activity in the sample.
S Test AMY – Amylase in the sample catalyses the cleavage of α-2-chloro-4-
nitrophenol-α-galactopyranosyl maltoside substrate to form the visible product 2-
choro-p-nitrophenol which is measured spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. The rate of
increase in absorbance is directly proportional to the α-amylase activity in the sample.
S Test AST – AST in the sample converts the L-aspartate and α-ketoglutarate in the
reagent to oxaloacetate and L-glutamate. The oxaloacetate undergoes reduction with
simultaneous oxidation of NADH to NAD in malate dehydrogenase catalyzed
indicator reaction. The rate of decrease in absorbance from NADH to NAD,
monitored bichromatically at 340 nm/546 nm, is proportional to the AST activity in a
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted in-house and at three Physician Office
Laboratories (POL) (with three trained operators typically found in these
settings) by testing three serum samples. The samples were run once a day,
three times per run for five days using one instrument at each site. The results
are presented below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The S Test ALP, S Test AMY and S Test AST cartridges are factory
calibrated and traceable to the Japanese Certified Enzyme Reference Materials
(JC ERM 20327 ALP, AMY) and (JCCLS CRM 003a AST). The 2-D barcode
printed on each cartridge provides the analyzer with lot-specific calibration
data.
Real time stability studies have been conducted. Protocols and acceptance
criteria were described and found to be acceptable. When stored at 2-8 ºC the
assay reagent is good until the expiration date on the label.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank and Limit of Detection were determined for each analyte
by running a low sample and a BSA sample, (7.5% in saline) for 3 days, 20
replicates/day for a total of 60 results. The testing was split between two
instruments. The detection limits were determined to be 20 U/l for ALP, 8
U/L for AMY and 8 U/L for AST.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies to determine the effects of Unconjugated Bilirubin,
Hemolysis and Lipemia were performed. Seven serum pool containing
approximately 62 U/L ALP, 66 U/L AMY and 17 U/L AST were spiked with
various concentrations of unconjugated bilirubin (0-50 mg/dL), hemoglobin
(0-1000 mg/dL) and Intralipids (0-2000 mg/dl). Sponsor states that
interference is considered to be significant if the analyte recovery changes by
more than 10%.
ALP – There was no significant interference (no change greater than 10%)
from bilirubin or lipemia at the tested concentrations. Hemolysis showed a
positive interference of (~15%) at 31 mg/dL. Any level of hemolysis may
cause interference. The sponsor states that users should not use hemolyzed
specimens.
AMY - There was no significant interference (no change greater than 10%)
from bilirubin or Lipemia at the tested concentrations. Hemolysis showed a
positive interference of (~17%) 31 mg/dL. Any level of hemolysis may cause
interference. The sponsor states that users should not use hemolyzed
specimens.
AST – There was no significant interference (no change greater than 10%) for
Lipemia at the tested concentrations. Positive interference (12-17%) occurred
at 1.6, 3.1, 6.3 and 12.5 mg/dL bilirubin, the four lowest levels tested. Any
level of icterus may cause interference. The sponsor states that users should
not use icteric specimens. Hemolysis showed a positive interference (>14%)
occurred at all levels tested. The sponsor states that users should not use
hemolyzed specimens.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical correlation studies were performed comparing the S-Test ALP, AMY
and AST results generated on the S40 Clinical analyzer against the results
from the ACE Clinical analyzer using totaling of 180 ALP samples, 196 AMY
samples and 177 AST samples. Of the 180 ALP serum samples (15 were
diluted and 17 were spiked samples), 196 AMY serum samples (20 were
diluted and 29 were spiked samples) and 177 AST serum samples (13 were
diluted and 27 were spiked samples). All the samples were measured in
singlet. The correlation study between the device and the predicate yielded the
following results
Test n Slope Intercept r Sample
range (U/L)
S Test ALP 182 0.969 -1.2 0.997 28 - 733

S Test AST 177 1.014 -0.83 0.998 10 - 333
Performance for the S Test ALP, S Test AMY and S Test AST was evaluated
at four Physician Office Laboratories and with a total of four operators.
Operators ran for ALP 46 unaltered clinical serum samples and 8 diluted
samples, AMY 41 unaltered clinical samples, 10 diluted and 12 spiked
samples and AST 41 unaltered clinical samples, 8 diluted and 12 spiked
samples. The S Test ALP, AMY and AST test results were compared to the
ACE results. All operators had experience running chemistry instruments. The
correlation study between the device and the predicate for serum yielded the
following results.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Eighty-one (81) normal serum samples for ALP, AMY and AST were evaluated
on the S40 Clinical Analyzer to determine if the reference range of the predicates
(ACE Clinical Analyzer and Piccolo) could be transferred to the new assays. The
sponsors’ acceptance criterion is 90% of the assay results for the normal samples
are within the predicate range. Analysis confirmed sufficient agreement (7.4%
ALP, 4.8% AMY and 8.6% AST non-congruent results, sponsor specification
<10%) to transfer the reference range.
ALP – 35-123 U/L
AMY – 25-125 U/L
AST - 11-38 U/L
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
