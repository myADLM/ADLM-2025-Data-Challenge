L. Test Principle:
S Test ALB – Bromcresol green (BCG) in solution binds specifically to albumin to
form a green colored complex which is measured bichromatically at 660 nm/ 700 nm.
The rate of increase in absorbance is directly proportional to the albumin activity in
the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three serum samples (with normal, intermediate and elevated levels) were
tested for albumin on two S40 Clinical Analyzers two times per run, two runs
per day, for a total of 22 days. The mean, standard deviations, and %
coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated for each sample.

In-house precision studies were conducted by testing human serum pools at
three levels. The samples were run three times a day for five days using one
instrument. Precision studies were also conducted at three Physician Office
Laboratories (POL) with four trained operators typically found in these
settings. Human serum pools at three concentrations were tested three times a
day for five days on four instruments (one at each lab). The results are
presented below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range is 0.4 to 7.1 g/dL for albumin. This range is supported
by the limit of detection study (section M.1.d below), the method comparison
(section M.2.a below), and the linearity study shown below.
Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by testing commercial
linearity standards, 7 levels each with known commercial concentrations of

albumin. Each level was tested in replicates of four. Results are presented

7 7.13 7.13 100%
Linear Regression: y = 0.989x + 0.210, r2 = 0.9950
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The S Test ALB cartridges are factory calibrated and traceable to the NIST
standard reference material SRM927d. The 2-D barcode printed on each
cartridge provides the analyzer with lot-specific calibration data.
Real time stability studies have been conducted. Protocols and acceptance
criteria were described and found to be acceptable. When stored at 2-8 ºC the
assay reagent is good until the expiration date.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Detection was determined by running a low sample and true
blank sample for 3 days, 20 replicates/day for a total of 60 results. The testing
was split between two instruments. The limit of detection for albumin is 0.4
g/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies to determine the effects of Unconjugated Bilirubin,
Hemolysis and Lipemia were performed. Seven serum pool containing
approximately 4.0 g/dl albumin were spiked with varies concentrations of
unconjugated bilirubin (1.6-50 mg/dL), hemoglobin (31-1000 mg/dL) and
Intralipids (63-2000 mg/dl). Sponsor states that interference is considered to
be significant if the analyte recovery changes by more than 10%.
There was no significant interference (no change greater than 10%) from
bilirubin or lipemia at the tested concentrations. Hemolysis showed a positive
interference (~11%) at 1000 mg/dL.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical correlation studies were performed comparing the S-Test ALB
generated on the S40 Clinical analyzer against the results from the ACE
Clinical analyzer.
A series of 92 serum specimens with albumin values ranging from 0.7 to 6.8
g/dL were assayed on the S40 Clinical Analyzer using S-Test ALB Reagent
and the ACE Clinical Chemistry System as the reference method. Least-
squares regression analysis (Deming) yielded the following results:
Regression Equation y = 0.927x + 0.28
Correlation Coefficient 0.9605
Std. Error Est. 0.24
Confidence Interval Slope 0.873 to 0.982
Confidence Interval Intercept 0.05 to 0.51
Point of Care
Performance for the S Test ALB was evaluated at four Physician Office
Laboratories and with a total of four operators. Operators ran unaltered
clinical serum samples obtained from each site. The S Test ALB test results
were compared to the ACE results. All operators had experience running
chemistry instruments. The correlation study between the device and the
predicate for serum yielded the following results.
n Slope Intercept Correlation Range
Lab A 56 0.998 -0.08 0.9927 0.5-6.8 mg/dL
Lab B 56 1.01 -0.07 0.9943 0.5-6.8 mg/dL

Lab D 56 0.985 -0.09 0.9874 0.5-6.8 mg/dL
b. Matrix comparison:
A study was performed on the S40 by running 33 albumin determinations on
paired samples drawn from the same patients in serum and heparin plasma
tubes. Albumin was added to six of these samples immediately after they were
drawn. Three paired serum/plasma samples were also diluted with saline. The
