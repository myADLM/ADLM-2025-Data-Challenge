K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None provided.
L. Test Principle:
The EliA Symphony Wells are coated with human recombinant U1RNP (RNP 70, A,
C), SS-A/Ro (60 kDa, 52 kDa), SS-B/La, Centromere B, Scl-70 and Jo-1 proteins,
native purified Sm proteins. If present in the patient's specimen, antibodies to the
antigens bind to their specific antigen. After washing away unbound antibodies,
enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgG antibodies (EliA IgG Conjugate) are
added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound
conjugate is washed away and the bound complex is incubated with a Development
Solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is
measured. The higher the response value, the more specific IgG is present in the
specimen. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is compared
directly to the response for calibrators.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the assay on ImmunoCAP 100 instrument was determined by
testing four serum samples in two replicates on three instruments in 18 runs
with a calibration curve in each run. Results showed that three positive
samples with Ratio ranges from 1.5-12.8 had 3.3 - 5.4%CV and 3.6 – 3.9 %
CV for the intra-assay and inter-assay studies respectively; and one negative
sample with 0.7 Ratio had 5.6 %CV and 1.4% CV for the intra-assay and
inter-assay studies respectively (see below).

1 0.7 5.6 1.4
2 1.5 4.7 3.7
3 5.9 3.3 3.9
4 12.8 5.4 3.6
The precision of the assay on ImmunoCAP 250 instrument was determined by
testing four serum samples in duplicate on three instruments in 21 runs with a
calibration curve in each run. Results showed that two positive samples with
2.3 – 11.9 Ratio ranges had 3.7 – 4.1%CV and 3.9 – 4.8 % CV for the intra-
assay and inter-assay studies respectively; and two negative sample with 0.3 –
0.9 Ratio ranges had 8.8 – 14.8 %CV and 0.0 – 2.5% CV for the intra-assay
and inter-assay studies respectively (see below).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Hook Effect:
Hook effect was analyzed using dilutions from a high positive serum sample
mix with an estimated concentration greater than the highest calibrator,
Calibrator 600 (600 μ/L) in two runs with four replicates/sample. A complete
calibration curve was included (2 replicates/ calibrator). No hook effect was
observed for concentrations up to 6000 μ/L, which is 10 fold above the
highest calibrator measuring range.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The EliA IgG calibrators are traceable to the International Reference
Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of the Human Serum Immunoglobulins A, G, and M
from WHO. New batches of IgG calibrators are compared to a secondary
standard (standardized with the IRP) or the IRP directly and adjusted
accordingly to meet the correct concentration (5 levels).
There are no international standards for ANA antibodies. The positive and
negative controls are prepared in house and arbitrary Ratio units are assigned
during the development process.
Stability studies were performed with the acceptance criteria of >90%
recovery from date of manufacture. Stability data showed shelf life of 24
months for EliA Symphony wells and EliA ANA Controls. The expiration
date claims are 18 months for EliA Symphony wells and 24 months for EliA
ANA Controls.
d. Detection limit:
The lower limit of the measuring range was determined by measuring
dilutions (1/2, 1/4, and 1/8) of Calibrator 4.0 (4 µg/L of IgG) in EliA sample
diluent and run on EliA IgG Calibrator wells. The results in Response Units
(RU) were compared with the result of the sample diluent on the different
EliA Symphony wells. All samples were measured in duplicates. The
discrimination ability ‘D’ of the assay should be >2 for calibrator 4 diluted 1:4
(i.e. 1.0 µg/L IgG/L). The 1/8 diluted calibrator 4 (0.5 µg/L) still can be
discriminated from background given by the signal of the diluent on EliA
Symphony wells (as shown in the table below). The lower limit of detection
was set at 0.5 µg/L corresponding to 0.5 Ratio.

The potential interferent and the corresponding blanks were added to the EliA
ANA positive control used as a positive serum sample, diluted twice (1:2 and
1:4) with EliA diluent. The spiked samples (900 μL diluted serum and 10 μL
of interferent) were tested in triplicate. The ratio of the result of the sample
spiked with the interfering substances and the sample spiked with a buffer
blank was determined as shown in the table below:

and Rheumatoid Factor (up to 5.0 IU/mL) did not adversely affect the results
of the new device. The package insert states not to use lipemic, hemolyzed,
icteric or microbially contaminated samples.
Crossreactivity with other autoantibodies: The EliA Symphony Immunoassay
was tested with 17 sera containing other autoantibodies specific for tissue
transglutaminase IgG (3), gliadin IgG (3), MPO ANCA (3), PR3 ANCA (3),
thyroid globulin (3), and thyroid peroxidase (2). Results were all negative <
0.7 Ratio (ranged from 0.1 – 0.4 Ratio).
f. Assay cut-off:
The purpose of the normal sera studies was to evaluate expected values in the
normal population and to confirm the defined cut-off. Samples from 400
apparently healthy Caucasian adult blood donors were measured. The
individuals were equally distributed by age and gender. The results were
equally distributed and not dependent on age or gender. The 95th percentile
(0.4 Ratio) lies below the lower limit of the equivocal range (0.7-1.0 Ratio).
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:

proteins: testing was performed on 137 samples from clinically defined

Instrument platform comparison:
For this comparison study, a total of 36 samples (2 negative and 34 positive
samples) distributed over the Ratio range were tested. All samples were run
on three IC 250 instruments and three IC 100 instruments in two runs and
single replicates. Regression analysis showed a slope of 0.9888 and a y-
intercept of 0.0403 with r = 0.989. Specifications was fulfilled (r >0.9).
b. Matrix comparison:
Serum and plasma (heparin, EDTA, citrate) samples, covering the Ratio range

between matrices. The correlation coefficients were acceptable and no bias
observed.
