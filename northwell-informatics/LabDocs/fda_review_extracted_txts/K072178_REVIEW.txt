Second Edition, Villanova PA

Ed. (2005).
L. Test Principle:
The test procedure involves two incubation steps:
1. Patient sera are diluted and the diluted test sera are incubated in a vessel
containing a multiplexed bead suspension consisting of a mixture of distinguishable
sets of polystyrene microspheres. Conjugated to the primary set of microspheres are
HSV gG-1 and HSV gG-2 antigens. The bead mix also contains one bead set
designed to detect non-specific antibodies in the patient sample (if present) and four
separate bead sets used for assay calibration. If present in patient sera, HSV 1 and
HSV 2 antibodies will bind to the corresponding immobilized antigen bead set. The
microspheres are rinsed to remove non-reactive serum proteins.
2. Phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Fc specific) is added to the vessel
and the plate is incubated. The conjugate will react with IgG antibody immobilized
on the solid phase in step 1. The bead suspension is then analyzed by the AtheNA
Multi-Lyte® instrument. The bead set(s) are sorted (identified) and the amount of
reporter molecule (PE conjugate) is determined for each bead set. Using the Intra-
Well Calibration Technology®, internal calibration bead sets are used to establish the
assay’s cutoff. Raw fluorescence from each distinct HSV gG-1 and HSV gG-2
antigen bead type is measured and compared against the cut-off calibrator.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Assay precision was evaluated at three sites (one internal and 2 external) for
three days as follows: Six samples were identified for use in the study based
upon their activity on the AtheNA Multi-Lyte assay. Two samples were
clearly negative, two were clearly positive and two samples were near the
assay cut off. One run was performed each day at each lab, the samples were
diluted twice and each dilution was run in quadruplicate, resulting in eight
results per assay and 24 replicates per specimen. The study for HSV 1 and 2
is summarized below:

d. Detection limit:

e. Analytical specificity:
Potential cross-reactivity was evaluated as follows: 10 samples, dual negative
for HSV IgG 1 and 2, that were sero-positive, to Measles, Mumps, EBV VCA,
EBNA, Rubella, VZV, ANA, CMV by commercially available test systems
manufactured by Zeus Scientific, Inc. for commercial distribution. In all cases
the specimens remained negative for HSV 1 and 2 IgG. Potential cross
reactivity with E. coli which is the recombinant vector for the gG1 and gG2
antigens used in the assay was not assessed, due to difficulties in obtaining the
appropriate samples.
The effect of potential interfering substances on sample results generated
using the AtheNA Multi-Lyte HSV 1 & 2 IgG test system was evaluated with
the following possible interfering substances based on the guidelines
established in CLSI EP7-A2 (18): albumin, bilirubin, cholesterol, hemoglobin,
triglycerides and intralipids. Three samples were chosen based on their
performance on the AtheNA Multi-Lyte test system: positive (HSV-1, 818
AU/mL; HSV-2, 566 AU/mL), borderline (HSV-1, 152 AU/ml; HSV-2, 92
AU/mL) and negative (HSV-1, 62 AU/mL; HSV-2, 34AU/mL). The samples
were exposed to the possible interfering substance, tested in duplicate and the
mean established. All qualitative results remained unchanged; indicating that
the interfering effect of the substances tested is minimal. However, the
negative HSV-1 sample exhibited an increase in signal of 33% with the low
spike of albumin and an increase in signal of 39% with the high spike of
albumin. The negative HSV-2 sample showed a change in signal of 37% with
the low spike of albumin and 28% with the high spike of albumin. The
negative HSV-2 sample also showed changes in signal with bilirubin, 43%
and 52%, albumin, 37% and 28%, hemoglobin, 53% and 52% and intralipids,
52% and 34%, low and high spikes of interfering substances respectively.
The change of signal in these negative samples did not change the qualitative
outcome in these samples, the results remained negative.
f. Assay cut-off:
6

--- Page 7 ---
The cut-off was established using 27 known negative samples, confirmed by a
commercially distributed ELISA. Additionally, a minimum of 5 known
positive samples, also confirmed by a commercially distributed ELISA assay
were tested. The results of the known positive samples were ascertained to
exceed the theoretical cut-off as well as the negative samples were ascertained
to fall below the theoretical cut-off. The cut-off was set equal to mean plus
7X SD for HSV1 and mean plus 6XSD for HSV2. The cut-off was validated
by the clinical studies, the values for the mean; SD and cut-off from the
clinical studies were as follows:
HSV-1 HSV-2
Mean 15 31
SD 17 19.8
Cut-off 118 119
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with reference method:
Performance in Sexually Active Adults:
Comparative studies were performed using a total of 317 prospectively
collected samples at three clinical sites to demonstrate the equivalence of the
AtheNA Multi-Lyte HSV 1 & 2 to the reference method a commercially
distributed HSV 1 and 2 immunoblot test system. Zeus Scientific tested 135
samples. Two outside investigators tested 84 samples and 98 samples
respectively. The samples were sequentially submitted to the laboratories,
archived and masked. The samples were collected from sexually active adults
between the ages of 17 and 70 and submitted for Herpes simplex antibody
testing. Results of this comparative study in the three sites combined are
presented below:
The data was analyzed including counting the equivocal results from the
comparator and the investigational device against the performance of the
investigational device.
