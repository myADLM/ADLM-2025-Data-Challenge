L. Test Principle:
Calcium
This reagent utilizes Arsenazo III, which has a high affinity for calcium at neutral pH.
Interference from magnesium is eliminated by the addition of 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-
sulfonic acid. Arsenazo III reacts with calcium to form a 1:1 blue complex with an
absorption maximum at 650 nm. The concentration of calcium is proportional to the
intensity of the blue color.
Cholesterol
Cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed by cholesterol esterase to cholesterol and fatty
acids. Cholesterol is oxidized by cholesterol oxidase with the simultaneous
production of hydrogen peroxide. In the presence of peroxidase, hydrogen peroxide
oxidizes phenol and 4-aminoantipyrine to give a quinoneimine dye colored red. The
intensity of the color produced is proportional to the concentration of cholesterol in
the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Calcium
Linearity studies were performed using commercially available linearity
standards. The concentrations tested ranged from 1.1 mg/dL to 20 mg/dL and
the observed values demonstrated acceptable recovery compared to the
expected values. A linear regression was performed resulting in a slope of
0.97, an intercept of -0.09, and a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.999. These
results demonstrate linearity across the reportable range of 1 – 15 mg/dL.
In order to validate the extended range, several samples were spiked to
concentrations between 15 mg/dL and 30 mg/dL and re-tested using the
automated procedure with a lower sample volume. These samples were also
manually diluted off line and re-tested. The results from the automated re-test
were all within ± 5% of the results from the manual off line dilution. The
extended range allows the user to measure samples with calcium
concentrations up to 30 mg/dL.
Cholesterol
Linearity studies were performed using commercially available linearity
standards. The concentrations tested ranged from 10 mg/dL to 667 mg/dL and
the observed values demonstrated acceptable recovery compared to the

expected values. A linear regression was performed resulting in a slope of
1.02, an intercept of 1.10, and a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.999. These
results demonstrate linearity across the reportable range of 10 – 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The reagents are stable up to the expiration dates shown on the label when
they are stored as recommended.
The assay is certified by the Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory
Network.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of the blank (LOB) was determined by evaluating a blank sample
run n=20 on multiple instruments. The limit of detection (LOD) was
calculated by evaluating low level analyte samples n=20 on multiple
instruments. For calcium the LOB was determined to be 0.02 mg/dL and the
LOD was 0.15 mg/dL. For cholesterol the LOB was determined to be 1.26
mg/dL and the LOD was 1.97 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Testing for interfering substances was based on CLSI EP-7A. Calcium and
cholesterol samples with increasing amounts of interferent were tested and
compared to an interferent free sample. The following substances were tested
with calcium and cholesterol: Hemoglobin to 500 mg/dL; Bilirubin to 20
mg/dL; and Intralipid to 2250 mg/dL. Glucose to 600 mg/dL and Ascorbic
Acid to 25 mg/dL were tested with cholesterol, but not for calcium. The
sponsor defined interference as the highest level tested that does not cause >
10% change in analytical result. The calcium samples showed no interference
up to 500 mg/dL hemoglobin, 20 mg/dL bilirubin, and 2250 mg/dL of
intralipid. The cholesterol samples showed no interference up to 500 mg/dL
hemoglobin, 5 mg/dL bilirubin, 2250 mg/dL intralipid, 600 mg/dL glucose,
and 10 mg/dL ascorbic acid.
