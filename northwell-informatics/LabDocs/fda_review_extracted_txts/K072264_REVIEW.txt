streptavidin-coated paramagnetic particles; hCG antibody solution; wash buffer and
substrate (indoxyl-3-phosphate and lucigenin) in buffer with preservatives.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Beckman Coulter Access hCG
2. Predicate K number(s):
k023480, k980173
3. Comparison with predicate:

methodology (chemiluminescence). Specific reagents and antibodies differ. The
predicate device is for use on the Access® System; this device is for use on the
Fastpack® System.

L. Test Principle:
The test is a chemiluminescence “sandwich” assay. A monoclonal anti-hCG antibody
labeled with alkaline phosphatase reacts with hCG in a sample. A second monoclonal
anti-hCG antibody, covalently couple to biotin and pre-bound to streptavidin-coated
paramagnetic particles is added. Particles are washed to remove unbound materials.
Chemiluminogenic substrate is added, resulting in chemiluminescence measured by
the Fastpack® System. The amount of labeled antibody is directly proportional to the
concentration of hCG in the measured sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Imprecision evaluations were performed using serum-based control materials.
Each control was tested in duplicate for 10 days. Two reagent lots (40
replicates each) and 3 instruments (1 instrument used for each lot, plus one in
common to both lots) were used in testing. There were 80 replicate
measurements for each control. Data was analyzed using ANOVA. Results
are shown below.

A linearity evaluation was performed according to CLSI document EP-6A to
assess the range of linearity. A single pool with an endogenous concentration
of 940.6 mIU/mL was diluted to the concentrations shown below. Differences
between expected and measured values were all within 10%. Evaluation
based on the EP-6A guideline resulted in less than 5 mIU/mL deviation
between a linear fit and a higher order fit in the concentration range 0-50
mIU/mL, and less than 25 mIU/mL deviation in the range 50-1000 mIU/mL.
A table of expected and measured values from this evaluation is shown below.

A dilution evaluation was also performed. Two serum pools with high
endogenous concentrations of hCG were diluted with either PBS or
Fastpack® hCG diluent, and measured in triplicate using the Fastpack®
System. Percent recoveries (based on observed/expected concentrations) are
shown below for the 2 diluents tested. Results in the table are results for one
of the serum pools. Results of the evaluation with the second serum pool
were comparable. Expected concentrations are based on the measured value
of the neat sample and the dilution factor.

High dose hook effect was observed at high values outside the reportable
range. These values are reported by the instrument as >1000 mIU/mL, and
should be diluted and retested to obtain quantitative results.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
A master calibration curve is generated for each lot of FastPack® reagents.
Since FastPack® System analyzers vary in response levels, the initial starting
point needs to be determined on each analyzer and normalized to fit the
manufacturer’s generated calibration curve. The FastPack® hCG Calibrator
Kit is used for this purpose.
The nominal lot concentrations for the calibrator in the Fastpack calibration
kit is 250 mIU/mL. The allowed variability between lots is +/- 10%. The
allowed uncertainty in measurement of the calibrator is +/- 10%. The
traceability process is based on ISO 17511, Primary standards are prepared
gravimetrically from a reconstituted vial of WHO 75/589. Values are
transferred from primary to secondary materials using the Fastpack hCG
assay. The secondary standards are used to assign values to individual test
lots.
Opened and closed vial calibrator stability is performed at 2-8 degrees C.
Measurements are made on at least 2 replicates, and 2 instruments. The
acceptance criterion for recovery is 90-110% of time 0.
(Control materials were not included within this 510(k)).
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LOB), limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantitation
(LOQ) were determined according to CLSI EP17-A. The limit of blank was
determined from 10 replicate determinations of the FastPack® hCG sample
diluent on each of three different FastPack® instruments using two different
lots of reagent sets. Raw RLUs from the assays were converted to apparent
mIU/mL based on the calibration curve for each assay. The LOB was
determined as the maximum observed value. This value was 0.8 mIU/mL
hCG.
To estimate LOD, a low control sample (3.5 mIU/mL) was measured over 10
days, using 2 instruments and 2 lots, and 2 assays each day, for a total of 80
measurements. The standard deviation for the low sample was 0.57mIU/mL.
The standard deviation for the “0” sample was 0.2. Using the equation:
LOD=LOB + (c * SD ), LOD was calculated as 1.4 mIU/mL.
B s

--- Page 6 ---
(In the equation, c = 1.645/(1-(1/(4 *f)), where f is the degrees of freedom,
ß
and SD is the standard deviation of the observations.) In this study, the LOD
S
was 1.8 mIU/mL hCG.
For the LOQ analyses, the prospectively defined goals for accuracy were 80-
120% recovery and <20% CV. The concentration of a serum control sample
was determined by multiple measurements on the predicate device to be 3.34
mIU/mL. The sample was measured on the hCG Fastrack®; twenty replicates
were measured using 2 lots and 2 instruments, for a total of 80 measurements,
over 3 day. Results were as follows:
Mean: 3.13 mIU/mL; SD: 0.59 mIU/mL; %CV: 18.7; recovery relative to the
predicate device: 94%. This supports the claimed LOQ of 3.1 mIU/mL hCG.
e. Analytical specificity:
The potential cross-reactants LH, FSH, and TSH were tested for cross-
reactivity with the assay in the absence of hCG. Each substance was tested at
a concentration of 1000 mIU/mL. No significant cross-reactivity (<0.5
mIU/mL) was observed.
Bilirubin (30 mg/dL), hemoglobin (500 mg/dL), lipemia (1800 mg/dL), and
human albumin (3 g/dL) were tested for interference at hCG concentrations of
3 mIU/mL and 500 mIU/mL. No significant cross-reactivity (<0.5 mIU/mL)
was observed.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Serum samples from 106 apparently healthy women, containing varying hCG
concentrations were evaluated using the FastPack® hCG assay and the
predicate device. Samples ranged from 0 to 865 mIU/mL using the FastPack
Assay. Results were evaluated using Deming regression. The following
regression equation was determined:
(Predicate device)=1.11(FastPack) + 8.04, R2=0.99, standard error of the
estimate = 19.88.
b. Matrix Comparison
To support the indications for use of this device with EDTA and Lithium
heparin plasma, blood collections were obtained from over 106 healthy
volunteers. Samples from 80 of the volunteers were spiked with hCG to
obtain concentrations ranging from 0 to 645 mIU/mL. All samples were
processed to either matched serum and EDTA plasma, or serum and Lithium
heparin plasma. Results are shown below:

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable. The device is for quantitative measurements.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Samples were obtained from 126 non-pregnant apparently healthy female blood
donors without any clinically abnormal indications. The hCG levels were
determined using the FastPack® hCG Immunoassay in conjunction with the
FastPack® System in order to establish the hCG concentrations in the reference
populations. The reference interval (5th to 95th percentiles) for the FastPack® hCG
Immunoassay for males is <0.8 – 1.7 mIU/mL and <0.8 – 3.0 mIU/mL for non-
pregnant females. These reference intervals reflect the donor population of this
study group. Each laboratory should determine their own reference intervals
appropriate for their population. The distribution of values for non-pregnant
females is presented in the histogram below.
