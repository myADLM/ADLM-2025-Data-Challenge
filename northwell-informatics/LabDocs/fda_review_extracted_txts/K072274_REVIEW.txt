L. Test Principle:
The Major III Blood Glucose Monitoring System employs amperometric technology, using
glucose oxidase. When blood is applied to the test strip, electrons are formed by the reaction
between glucose oxidase and blood glucose. The resulting electric current is measured by
the meter and correlates with the concentration of glucose in the blood sample.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated within-day and between day precision of the device using
whole blood samples spiked with 5 different glucose concentrations, two test strip
lots, and 10 meters. Ten replicate measurements were tested for each concentration
each day, for a total of 20 days. Results for each test strip lot are summarized in the
tables below:
Lot 1

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The measuring range of the device is 30-600 mg/dL. Testing was performed using
oxygenated venous blood samples at 10 different blood glucose levels, ranging from
30-687 mg/dL, tested on 2 lots of test strips. The YSI was used as the reference
method. The linear regression for lot 1 was y = 1.033x – 7.5088, r2 = 0.9991, and the
linear regression of lot 2 was y = 1.0366x – 10.141, r2 = 0.9994.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The control solutions are manufactured by Diacare Corporation and previously
cleared under k062538. Bestgen recommends the use of these control solutions with
their test system.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit is 30 mg/dL. See linearity/assay reportable range above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Three endogenous and seven exogenous substances were tested for interference on
this assay at a low and high glucose concentration. Two test strip lots and ten meters
were used in this study. Of those substances tested, ascorbic acid greater than 1.2
mg/dL, dopamine greater than 30 mg/dL, L-Dopa greater than 10 mg/dL, and uric
acid greater than 7 mg/dL showed interference
The effect of hematocrit was evaluated in a study using samples with 5 glucose
concentrations (30, 70, 150,260, and 600 mg/dL) and varying hematocrit levels
between 30-70%. Each glucose level/hematocrit combination was tested on 10
meters, by comparing the results of samples at each of the varying hematocrit levels
to the sample of the same glucose concentration at a normal (40%) hematocrit level.
The results for hematocrit levels are presented below. The sponsor chose an
acceptable hematocrit range of 30-55%:

600 31.1 24.4 17.0 -13.0 -17.9 -34.0 -40.8 -45.3
Temperature and humidity studies were performed and showed that the meter can be
used at temperatures from 10-400C and at relative humidity ranging from 20-80%.

Altitude studies were conducted with whole blood samples at 5 concentrations (56,
75, 123, 238 and 478 mg/dL) and with 2 levels of controls (normal and high). Study
results demonstrated no interference at elevations up to 6266 feet above sea level.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed with two hundred forty fingerstick
patient samples. The study participants obtained and tested their own samples using
only the directions in the labeling, followed by a trained technician performing testing
on the same individuals. The technicians also obtained venous samples from which
plasma aliquots were assayed on the YSI instrument. These samples ranged in
concentration from 50-505 mg/dL. To obtain samples with values < 50 mg/dL, the
sponsor followed the procedure in section 7.3.1.2 in the ISO 15197 standard, using
samples from 10 of the study participants. These 10 samples are included in the
regression analysis of samples tested by the technicians, accounting for a total of 240
samples. The total number of samples tested by the patients was 230. The linear
regressions were as follows:
Patient vs YSI y = 0.919x + 11.73, r2 = 0.9731
Healthcare professional vs YSI y = 0.982x + 0.45, r2 = 0.978
Patient vs healthcare professional y = 0.964x + 4.44, r2 = 0.990
