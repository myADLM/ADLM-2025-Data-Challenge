H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Fibrinogen Calibrators 1 to 6 are used to prepare reference curves for the assay of
fibrinogen by the method of Clauss using Dade Behring Multifibren™ U.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Fibrinogen Calibrators 1 to 6 are used to prepare reference curves for the assay of
fibrinogen by the method of Clauss using Dade Behring Multifibren™ U.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Not applicable.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable.
I. Device Description:
The Fibrinogen Calibrators are lyophilized calibrators prepared using pooled human
plasma from selected, healthy donors that has been diluted with buffer solution or
supplemented with purified fibrinogen and stabilized. This calibrator is supplied in a
one pack, containing 6 - 1.0 mL vials.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Not Applicable.
L. Test Principle:
The Fibrinogen Calibrators consists of pooled human plasma from selected, healthy
donors that has been diluted with buffer solution or supplemented with purified
fibrinogen and are stabilized with Herpes Buffer (12g/L) and lyophilized. They are
supplied in siliconized vials in order to prevent contact activation of the coagulation
system. These calibrators are assigned by determining the quality of coagulable
fibrinogen by the method of Ratnoff and Menzie as well as by the Kjeldahl method.
The exact values are given on the enclosed lot-dependant table of analytical values
and on the vial labels.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not Applicable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The new value assignment procedure was evaluated by testing three (3) lots of
the Fibrinogen Calibrator Kit with two (2) lots of Multifibren™ U reagent on
a Dade Behring BCS and a Sysmex® CA-1500 analyzer. Patient samples
spanning the measuring range and quality control materials recovered
fibrinogen values within the expected ranges.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The exact values are given on an enclosed lot-dependant table of analytical values
and on the vial labels. The calibrators are adjusted to the following values:
1 – 0.6 g/L
2 – 1.1 g/L
3 – 2.5 g/L
