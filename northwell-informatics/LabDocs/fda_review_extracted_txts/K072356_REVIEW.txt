L. Test Principle:
Calcium in the sample combines with o-cresolphthalein complexone in alkaline
medium to form a reddish-purple color, which is measured bichromatically at
600/660 nm. The intensity of color produced is directly proportional to the calcium
concentration in the sample.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted in-house and at three Physician Office
Laboratories (POL) (with three trained operators typically found in these
settings) by testing three serum samples. The samples were run once a day,
three times per run for five days using one instrument at each site. The results
are presented below:
CA mg/dL

POL 3 3 14.0 3.9% 4.3%
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by testing 6 levels of
commercial linearity standards with known concentrations of calcium. Each
level was tested in replicates of four. Results are presented below:

6 14.63 14.63 100%
Linear regression y = 1.004x + 0.090, r2 = 0.9987
The reportable range of the assay is 2.3-14.6 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The S Test CA cartridge is factory calibrated and traceable to the NIST
standard Reference material SRM915b. The 2-D barcode printed on each
cartridge provides the analyzer with lot-specific calibration data.
Real time stability studies have been conducted. Protocols and acceptance
criteria were described and found to be acceptable. When stored at 2-8 ºC the
assay reagent is good until the expiration date.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank and Limit of Detection were determined by running a low
sample (five different samples) and a BSA sample, (7.5% in saline). Each low
sample was run for 3 days, 4 replicates/day. The blank sample was run 20
replicates/day for 4 days. The testing was split between two instruments. The
Limit of Detection was determined to be 2.3 mg/dL Ca2+.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies to determine the effects of Unconjugated Bilirubin,
Hemolysis and Lipemia were performed. Seven serum pools containing
approximately 11.0 mg/dl CA were spiked with varies concentrations of
unconjugated bilirubin (0-50 mg/dL), hemoglobin (0-1000 mg/dL) and
Intralipids (0-2000 mg/dl). Sponsor states that interference is considered to be
significant if the analyte result is different from the control by + 10%.
There was no significant interference from bilirubin or Lipemia. No
significant interference of hemoglobin to 500 mg/dL. A negative bias (17%)
occurred at 1000 mg/dL hemoglobin.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical correlation studies were performed comparing the S-Test Calcium
results generated on the S40 Clinical analyzer against the results from the
ACE Clinical analyzer using a total of 181 serum samples. Of the 181 serum
samples (18 were diluted and 16 were spiked samples). All the samples were
measured in singlet.
The correlation study between the device and the predicate yielded the
following results.
Test n Slope Intercept r Sample
range (U/L)
S Test CA 181 0.977 -0.07 0.978 2.4 – 14.5
Performance for the S Test CA was evaluated at four Physician Office
Laboratories with a total of four operators who are typical operators at these
sites. Operators ran from 52 or more unaltered clinical serum samples
obtained from each site as well as 8 diluted and 6 spiked samples. The S Test
CA test results were compared to the ACE results. The correlation study
between the device and the predicate for serum yielded the following results.
n Slope Intercept r Sample
range (U/L)
Lab A 54 0.948 0.28 0.929 2.7 -11.7
Lab B 54 0.953 0.38 0.944 2.7 -11.7

Lab D 55 0.946 0.60 0.965 2.7 -11.7
b. Matrix comparison:
A serum / plasma comparison study was performed for the S-Test CA assay.
Thirty paired samples were assayed on the S40 System. Two samples were
spiked and four samples were diluted to help cover the assay range. The
correlation was as follows:
y = 0.962x + 0.4, r = 0.985, range 4.1-14.5

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Eighty-four (84) normal serum samples for CA were evaluated on the S40
Clinical Analyzer to determine if the reference ranges of the predicate (ACE
Clinical Analyzer) could be transferred to the new assays. The sponsors’
acceptance criterion is 90% of the assay results for the normal samples are within
the predicate range. Analysis confirmed sufficient agreement (6.0% non-
congruent results for calcium, sponsor specification <10%) to transfer the
reference range.
Expected values – 8.5-10.5 mg/dL
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
