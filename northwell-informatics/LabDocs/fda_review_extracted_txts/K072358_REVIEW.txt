Three of the 4 predicate devices detect individual entities to aid in the diagnosis of anti-
neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) associated small blood vessel vasculitides.
Such vasculitides include Wegener’s granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, Churg-
Strauss syndrome, and kidney-localized forms of these diseases. The inclusion of glomerular
basement membrane disease is due to the clinical observation that such patients may have
ANCA, though not all ANCA producing patients have autoantibodies to glomerular
basement membrane. The reason to include the fourth predicate device is due to the
observation, largely a clinical consensus, that the combined use of enzyme immunoassays to
these antigens when combined with immunofluorescence detection of ANCA, reflected in
this predicate, gives the highest specificity and reasonable sensitivity for ANCA-associated
vasculitides.

L. Test Principle:
The kit uses multiplex flow immunoassay, an assay technology resembling traditional
enzyme immunoassay, but permits simultaneous detection and identification of several
analytes in a single assay. Three (3) different populations of magnetic microbeads are coated
with antigens associated with vasculitis disease (MPO, PR3 and GBM). The BioPlex 2200
Instrument System combines an aliquot of patient sample, sample diluent, and bead reagent
into a reaction vessel. The mixture is incubated at 37°C. After a wash cycle, anti-human IgG
antibody, conjugated to phycoerythrin (PE), is added to the beads and this mixture is
incubated at 37°C. The excess conjugate is removed in another wash cycle, and the beads are

re-suspended in wash buffer. The bead mixture then passes through the fluorescence
detector. The fluorescence detector utilizes flow cytometric hardware technology to detect
both the identity of the beads and the amount of antibody captured by the bead-bound
antigen. Raw data is calculated in relative fluorescence intensity (RFI). Beads used in the
assay have embedded within them a ratio of fluorescent dyes whose final spectral
characteristics are unique to that population of beads. Varying ratios of fluorescent dyes
changes the spectral characteristics of different bead populations. It is therefore possible to
coat one bead population with a certain analyte, combine the beads into a single reagent, and
detect each population of beads and its bound analyte at analysis. The preferred biological
specimen type used in the assay is human serum.
Three additional dyed beads, an Internal Standard Bead (ISB), a Serum Verification Bead
(SVB) and a Reagent Blank Bead (RBB) are present in each reaction mixture to verify
detector response, the addition of serum or plasma to the reaction vessel, and the absence of
significant non-specific binding in serum or plasma. The instrument is calibrated using a set
of four (4) distinct calibrator vials, supplied separately. The calibrator vials represent four
(4) different antibody concentrations and establish semi-quantitative calibration. The result
for each of these antibodies is expressed as an antibody index (AI). The detected anti-
neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies are human IgG.
The Control Set includes a negative control as well as a multi-analyte positive control
containing antibodies present for analytes within the kit. The positive control is
manufactured to give positive results, with values above the cut-off for each specific bead.
The negative control is manufactured to give negative results, with values below the cut-off
for each specific bead.
The recommended minimum frequency for performing quality control is once every 24-hour
testing period. Performing quality control is also necessary after each new assay calibration
and certain service procedures.
Statistical quality control (QC) tests can be applied periodically to determine if assays are
performing as expected. These tests assess any significant changes in the mean and standard
deviation of the results for the analyte, beyond the inherent variations of the assay when
processed on the instrument. Kit quality control analysis is performed by processing control
samples and analyzing the mean and standard deviation of the analyte results over defined
intervals. This activity is monitored with Levey-Jenning graphs and Westgard Rules.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Separate internal and external studies were conducted to evaluate the reproducibility
of the proposed assay on the BioPlex 2200 instrument. The internal reproducibility
study was conducted in-house by the sponsor. The external reproducibility study was
conducted at each of the three clinical study sites.
Internal Precision Study
Precision of the assay was assessed in serum samples for antibodies to each of the
three analytes (MPO, PR3, GBM). Precision was determined by calculating the
within-run (intra-assay), between run (inter-assay), between-day (Inter-assay), and
Total Precision. A precision panel for each analyte was prepared. The panel
members for each assay included at least one negative sample (<0.2 AI), one high
5

--- Page 6 ---
negative sample (0.5 to 0.8 AI), two near cut-off samples (0.9 to 1.1 AI), two low
positive samples (1.3 to 2.0 AI), and two positive samples (3.0 to 5.0 AI). Each panel
member was prepared by spiking analyte negative serum with one or more positive
sample for one or more analytes.
Twenty days of precision were collected over a 23 days period for one reagent lot.
Each sample was run in duplicate per run for a total of eighty (80) data points per
sample. Two runs were performed each day with at least two hours separating each
run. All samples were randomized for each run and assay calibration was performed
at the start of the study. Controls were run daily to quality the run. Data analyses are
based on CLSI EP5-A2 Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry
Devices.
Precision specifications for samples at or above the cut-off point were:
Within Run: CV ≤ 10%
Between Run: CV ≤ 15%
Between Days: CV ≤ 15%
Total Precision: CV ≤ 20%
The following results for samples having an AI greater than 0.6 were obtained

External Reproducibility Study
In order to assess the reproducibility of the BioPlex 2200 Vasculitis Kit, a 10 member
reproducibility serum panel was prepared at Bio-Rad Laboratories and provided to
three sites for testing. Two lots of the Reagent Pack, two lots of the Calibrator Set
and two lots of Control Set were used to evaluate reproducibility. Two of the three
sites evaluated one lot and the third site evaluated a separate second lot of the kit.
Each of the panel members and Control Set were tested in duplicate on two runs per
day over 3 days (2 replicates x 2 runs x 3 days = 12 replicates per panel member per
site = 36 total replicates for 3 sites).
Each positive panel member of the 10 member reproducibility panel was prepared by
combining one or more patient samples positive for antibodies to MPO, PR3 and
GBM. Of the 10 panel members, two members had high levels of antibodies to MPO,
PR3 and GBM, two members had lower levels of antibodies to MPO, PR3 and GBM,
and two members had antibody levels near the cutoff for MPO, PR3 and GBM.
There were also one high negative and one low negative panel member. In addition,
1 positive control and 1 negative control was included and tested as panel members.
Each panel member described above was made in serum (N=10). Table 3 presents
the 10 member reproducibility panel and the target Antibody Index of each member.

analytes for total imprecision (< 20%CV).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A dilution linearity study was conducted internally for the three analytes contained in
the kit. The claimed assay range is 0.2 AI to 8 AI. The methods used to evaluate
dilution/linearity used a range from 0.2 to 9.9 AI. The extended assay range was
implemented to demonstrate linearity beyond the highest calibrator. Five high
positive serum samples were purchased for each analyte represented in the kit. The
samples were selected at the high end of the assay range. However, some analytes
contained very high concentrations and so high samples with values significantly
above the assay range (>20%) were initially diluted with negative serum to bring the
value within the range of the assay. All high samples with values within the assay
range were then diluted with negative serum using the following dilutions (% high
patient sample): 80%, 60%, 40%, 20%, 10%, and 0%. Each sample was tested in 4
replicates. Based on the CLSI guidelines EP6-A, (Vol. 23 No. 16, Evaluation of the
Linearity of Quantitative Measurement procedure: Statistical Approach) linear and
polynomial regression analysis of sample AI vs. dilution was performed to determine
if the dilution curve exhibits a statistically significant nonlinear regression. The
assessment of a non-linear curve is only a test of statistical significance, and indicates
that nonlinearity has been detected. It does not mean that the effect of this non-
linearity is enough to affect patient results. If the linear or non-linear regression

coefficients are significant, then calculated values obtained from the linear regression
are compared to calculated values obtained from either the second order polynomial
curve or the third order polynomial curve. The differences in the results between the
recovered and expected values (%difference) are then compared to the acceptance
criteria to determine acceptance. The acceptance criteria were: All dilutions must
recover with < 2SD or <20% of the expected result which is the clinical acceptance
range.
All of the patient samples exhibited non-linear curves on dilution for all three
analytes. In this analysis, the expected concentration was assumed to be the
concentration calculated by division of the observed undiluted concentration with the
reciprocal of the dilution, assuming perfect technical dilution. The regression
analyses utilized the observed AI for each analyte as the dependent y-variable vs. the
expected AI as the independent x-variable.
The deviation from linearity of the AI was within the sponsor’s clinical acceptance
criteria since the %deviation from linearity by the non-linear dilution curves was 20%
or less for all dilutions, except for the highest dilution. The percent deviation from
linearity for all samples at all dilutions ranged from -33% to 13%. Dilution of
samples with the lowest AI (highest dilution) displayed the greatest %deviation from
linearity. The following table illustrates the %deviation from linearity by the non-
linear dilution.
dilution mean % deviation from linearity
GBM MPO PR3
10 -30.9% -24.3% -26.4%
5 -1.7% -1.9% -1.7%
2.5 11.0% 8.3% 8.9%
1.67 8.1% 6.6% 6.8%
1.25 1.6% 1.6% 1.5%
1 -5.5% -4.5% -4.5%
All
dilutions -2.9% -2.4% -2.6%
This indicates that on average, the expected AI value will be 3% below the observed
value when the expected value is the concentration determined from the reciprocal of
the dilution. This difference in concentration is modest and likely not clinically
significant. The highest dilution had the greatest percent deviation from linearity and
is not unusual for an assay of this type. The assay detects autoantibodies, typically
low affinity antibodies, and displays difficulty when diffusion controlled binding
conditions occur, such as under high dilution and low autoantibody concentration
conditions.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
No reference standard for anti-MPO, anti-PR3, or anti-GBM exists. Calibrators and
controls are prepared for use and assigned arbitrary values during assay development.
d. Detection limit:
No information available. The reagent blank bead included in the kit is not coated
with MPO, PR3, or GBM antigens so it would not be expected to capture
9

--- Page 10 ---
autoantibody. However, the signal from this bead could be a random as well as a
non-random signal. A non-random signal would indicate binding of non-specific
material or antibody to beads and subsequent occurrence of an assay signal. A limit
of blank determination would measure the amount of random fluorescence present in
a specimen without any autoantibody or non-specific binding. If the random and non-
specific binding signal is subtracted from the fluorescence signal of specimens from
normal and diseased subjects then there would be little need to assess the random
signal (signal limit of a blank specimen).
e. Analytical specificity:
Separate interfering substances and cross reactivity studies were conducted internally
at Bio-Rad to evaluate the potential interference of specific endogenous and
exogenous substances and to determine whether or not cross-reactivity occurs in the
presence of non-vasculitis reactive IgG antibodies with the assay.
Interfering Substances
For the interfering substances study, human serum samples that were previously
characterized as positive for the various markers at concentrations near the middle of
the assay range (1.5 to 3.5 AI) were supplemented with various interfering
substances. A control was made for each interfering substance by spiking the pooled
sera with the solvent or solution used to make the interfering substance spiking
solution. The test sample and control were run using two reagent lots in replicates of
5 per lot (10 total). Calculations were established using CLSI EP7-A2. Potential
interference was defined as any substance that exhibited a % difference from the
control greater than the pre-established specification of 20%. Interference was
evaluated with the following interferents at the stated concentrations.
Endogenous Substances Exogenous Substances
Hemoglobin 500mg/dL Ascorbic Acid 3 mg/dL
Bilirubin (unconjugated) 20mg/dL Sodium Citrate 1000 mg/dL
Bilirubin (conjugated) 30 mg/dL EDTA 800 mg/dL
Triglycerides 3500mg/dL Lithium Heparin 8000 units /dL
Protein (total) 12.9 g/dL Sodium Heparin 8000 units/dL
Beta-Carotene 0.6mg/dL
Cholesterol 500mg/dL
Red Blood Cells 0.4% Concentration
Gamma-globulin 6g/dL
All three analytes met interference specifications for endogenous components and
exogenous substances. The degree of endogenous interference ranged from -8.0% to
0.0% for GBM, -2.7% to 2.7% for MPO and -4.2% to 4.5% for PR3 relative to
controls. Similarly, the degree of exogenous interference was 0.0% for GBM, ranged
from -2.6% to 0.0% for MPO, and -4.0% to 0.0% for PR3 relative to their respective
controls.
Cross Reactivity
For the cross reactivity study, human serum samples that were previously
characterized as positive for the various cross-reactants were evaluated for possible
cross reactivity in the assay. In order to evaluate whether reactivity was due to cross-
reactivity or reactivity to MPO, PR3 or GBM antibodies, the samples were also tested

>20% of the samples being positive by the proposed assay and those samples being
confirmed negative by the corresponding commercially available microplate enzyme
immunoassays. A panel of ten specimens high positive for each test cross reactant
(~2 times cut-off) were evaluated for possible cross -reactivity in the proposed assay,
with the exception of seven tissue transglutaminase positive samples and eight
Mitochondrial M2 positive samples due to limited availability of these samples.

The table lists 1 to 2 of 10 samples cross-reactive in the proposed assay. Only
histone, cardiolipin, and Parvovirus reactivity indicate a suspicion since there was
positive cross-reactivity in the proposed assay and not the other commercially
available test or vice versa. Due to the low number of tested samples, it is likely that
the proposed assay lacked reactivity for Parvovirus antibody and cardiolipin while
having 10% of tested samples had reactivity in the other commercially available EIA
due to random chance. For histone, the proposed assay had cross-reactivity in 2 of 10
samples for 2 analytes. It is not possible to determine based on this information if the
patient supplying the sample had anti-histone antibodies that cross react in the
proposed assay or had antibodies to the analytes in the proposed assay. It often
occurs that autoimmune patients with other autoimmune diseases have antibody
reactivity to MPO, PR3, and GBM.
f. Assay cut-off:
A final cut-off of 1.0 AI was sought for all analytes based on an evaluation of 356
serum samples with the assay and corresponding commercially available microplate
EIA tests using the results of these predicate assays as the reference outcome. Of the
356 serum samples, 315 were negative for GBM antibodies, 259 for MPO antibodies
and 195 for PR3 antibodies by the assay. Discordant results were confirmed by re-
testing samples using predicate and the proposed assay. ROC analysis was performed
for each analyte using this population of samples. For the purpose of establishing a
cut-off, equivocal samples on the commercially available microplate EIA tests were
not used during ROC analysis or in evaluating the concordance statistics.

Assay Number of Samples Agreement with Predicate
Positive Negative Overall
GBM ≥40 ≥100 95%
MPO ≥40 ≥100 95%
PR3 ≥40 ≥100 93%
The overall agreement is calculated from the ROC analysis at each cutoff value of the
proposed assay as part of the determination. The “sensitivity” value in the ROC is
therefore percent positive agreement while the “specificity” value is the percent
negative agreement. The cutoff values for each analyte with the above specifications
are one choice for a cutoff or range of cutoff values, though not clinically based.
A series of tables summarizes results for each analyte. For the GBM analyte, the

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Left-over serum specimens were obtained from routine clinical care/analysis.
Samples were collected based on inclusion/exclusion criteria per sample population.
Mayo Clinic study provided samples for 4 of 5 study populations meeting the study
inclusion criteria through a review of sample records.
(1) For the “Unselected Patient Samples Previously Tested on FDA-cleared
predicate tests (anti-MPO, anti-PR3 and/or anti-GBM)”, Mayo staff verified
through a review of sample records what samples had been tested for one or
more anti-MPO, anti-PR3 and/or anti-GBM tests. These were not selected on
test value but based on the use of one of the predicate tests. 300 specimens
were selected.
(2) For “Retrospective Known Positive Samples for anti-MPO”, Mayo staff
verified that samples enrolled in this population had a positive anti-MPO EIA
result through review of sample records. 100 specimens were selected.
(3) For “Retrospective Known Positive Samples for anti-PR3”, Mayo staff verified
that samples enrolled in this population had a positive anti-PR3 EIA result
through review of sample records. 100 specimens were selected.
(4) For “Retrospective Known Positive Samples for anti-GBM”, Mayo staff
verified that samples enrolled in this population had a positive anti-GBM EIA
result through review of sample records. 100 specimens were selected.
Bio-Rad Laboratories provided one of 5 study populations. Three hundred (300)
normal blood donor samples were purchased from one vendor and eighteen anti-
GBM known positive samples were purchased from another vendor by Bio-Rad
Laboratories and provided to Mayo Clinic for testing.
The following are listed as inclusion/exclusion criteria for sample selection from left-
over serum specimens:
• The sample is from a normal blood donor (purchased and provided by Bio-
Rad). Or
• The patient sample is left-over remnant from prior routine clinical testing with
a FDA-cleared predicate test (MPO, PR3 and/or GBM) and is not selected
based on the test value. Or
• The sample is retrospective and known positive for anti-MPO on an FDA-
cleared predicate test. Or
• The sample is retrospective and known positive for anti-PR3 on an FDA-
cleared predicate test. Or
• The sample is retrospective and known positive for anti-GBM on an FDA-
cleared predicate test.
• and the sample is serum and is >1.0 mL.
Exclusion Criteria
• The sample does not meet the inclusion criteria.
• The sample is from an individual previously enrolled in the study.
• Incorrect sample matrix (plasma).
• Sample known to be frozen and thawed > 3 times at time of testing.
• The sample is grossly hemolyzed.

Testing of samples was performed at The Mayo Clinic, San Francisco General
Hospital, and the sponsor’s testing lab. Samples tested in the study were stored at -
20°C or colder prior to being entered in the study. The samples were thawed and
centrifuged prior to testing in the proposed assay. Testing occurred within 1 – 2 days
after the samples were thawed. Samples were stored at 2-8°C after thawing and prior
to testing. Samples tested on the predicate assays were stored and tested the same as
above. Samples purchased by Bio-Rad Laboratories were received frozen on dry ice
and stored at ≤ -20°C prior to shipping the samples to the site for testing. These
samples were stored frozen (≤ -20°C or colder) prior to testing. After thawing, the
samples were tested within 7 days. Samples were stored at 2-8°C after thawing.
Mayo Clinic provided and tested 521 samples that were stored at 2-8°C for greater
than 7 days. Because this was outside the allowable storage conditions, the samples
were excluded from the study. A total of 1348 samples were tested. Eleven samples
were re-tested after initial error messages were obtained. Seven samples had “Serum
Verification Bead (SVB) signal too low” errors that did not resolve on repeat testing.
Three samples had multiple error messages including “Insufficient Bead Events to
Calculate Result” errors that did resolve on repeat testing. One sample had “Assay
Dispense Sample Volume Not Met” error that did resolve on repeat testing. The
repeat test result was used in the data analysis. Thus, four samples that were valid test
results on re-testing were included in analysis.
Three hundred (300) normal blood donors and three hundred (300) unselected patient
samples previously tested with the predicate assays were tested with the BioPlex 2200
Vasculitis kit. Seven of the 300 normal blood donor samples were excluded due to
"Serum Verification Bead (SVB) signal too low" analysis error during BioPlex 2200
Vasculitis kit testing. The BioPlex 2200 Vasculitis kit was further evaluated by
testing 227 retrospective samples positive for anti-MPO (N=100), anti-PR3 (N=100),
and anti-GBM (N=27). All samples were also tested by the corresponding
commercially available microplate EIA methods. In addition, the anti-MPO and anti-
PR3 positive samples were tested by an ANCA IFA method using ethanol-fixed
slides.

Testing of both EIA and IFA for each analyte is not compared with a clinical
diagnosis. To the extent that the predicate assays correlate with clinical disease and
to the extent that the overall agreement of the proposed assay with the predicate tests
is sufficiently high, this data indicates substantially equivalence and reasonable
effectiveness at diagnosis of clinical diseases stated in the Indications for use.

The BioPlex 2200 System consists of the instrument, family of assays, and software. The
instrument is an automated, floor-standing analyzer providing an integrated method for
random access (or STAT) heterogeneous, multiplexed immunoassays on serum or plasma
specimens. The instrument contains:
• sample handling, scheduling, and processing modules with associated reagent assay
packs
• signal detector module
• automated cleaning and maintenance modules
• external computer with software to control instrument, reagent assays, error detection
and handling, maintenance, and result analysis
• associated fluid storage, transfer, and removal
• connection interface with laboratory information systems
The detector module uses a proprietary flow cytometer-based multiplex technology to
simultaneously assess multiple related analytes.
1. Modes of Operation:
The instrument performs regular and STAT handling of assays and reagents.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
A barcode reader reads specimen identifying barcodes.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
A sample handling module performs specimen sampling and transfer of specimen and
reagents for the designated assay. Assays are designated via a work request input from
the user using a computer menu system.
5. Calibration:
To adjust differing instrument conditions and reagent lots, assay calibration is performed
at regular intervals. Calibration is performed for each new reagent lot, expiration of assay
calibration curve (after 30 days), or after sponsor performed field service.
6. Quality Control:
An Internal Standard bead functions as a correction of fluoresce intensity to detect and
compensate for Detector Module fluctuations. Serum verification bead functions to detect
the presence of serum in the specimen and the unexpected dilutions of specimens. A
reagent blank bead functions as a non-coated bead to identify non-specific binding of
materials. Non-specific binding possibly may give an unacceptably high signal. These
three beads function as internal quality control measures.
Positive and negative control materials are provided separately and are used in each assay
run to monitor performance of the assay. Materials are handled as specimens in the
assay. Standard laboratory quality control analysis (Levy-Jennings charts using
Westgard rules), is available for periodic assessment. These controls function as external
quality control measures.
The recommended minimum frequency of quality control monitoring is once every 24-
hour testing period. This interval may vary depending upon national, state, and local
requirements and regulations or upon local laboratory policy.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The

--- Page 21 ---
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Calibrators and controls
Control Set
The BioPlex 2200 Vasculitis Control Set is intended for use as an assayed quality control to
monitor the overall performance of the BioPlex 2200 Instrument and BioPlex 2200 Vasculitis
Reagent Pack in the clinical laboratory. The controls are provided in liquid form in a human
serum matrix made from defibrinated plasma containing preservatives including ProClin®
300 (0.3%) and Sodium Azide (0.095%). The control set includes individual 1.5 mL vials of
negative level and 1.5 mL vials of multi-analyte positive level, instructions for use, and
assignment of values sheet.
The positive controls contain known analyte concentrations of Myeloperoxidase, Proteinase
3, and Glomerular Basement Membrane derived from human disease state plasma. The
Negative Controls are prepared exclusively from the negative serum matrix. The Positive
Controls are prepared by blending human disease state serum with the negative serum matrix.
The recommended minimum frequency for performing quality control is once every 24-hour
testing period and with each new lot of Reagent Pack. The vials can be directly loaded into
the instrument sample racks and processed with the Reagent Pack in the same manner as
patient samples. All the vials have a pre-affixed barcode, a unique lot number and a QC
prefix identifying it as a quality control sample. Quality control data can be entered
manually, based on the data contained in the Assignment of Value Sheet or via CD-ROM.
The Data CD-ROM is available to load the necessary value assignment data into the
instrument. The CD-ROM has an XML file, which contains assigned values for the controls,
lot specific information such as expiration date, lot numbers and barcode ID.
Calibrator Set
The Calibrator Set is intended for the calibration of the Reagent Pack. The Reagent Pack is
calibrated using a set of four (4) distinct serum base calibrators. The Calibrators are provided
in a human serum matrix made from defibrinated plasma with added known analyte
concentrations of Myeloperoxidase, Proteinase 3, and Glomerular Basement Membrane
derived from human disease state plasma, and added preservatives including ProClin® 300
(0.3%) and Sodium Azide (0.095%). The Calibrators are manufactured independently from
the controls. The calibrators are prepared from defibrinated human plasma where the total
IgG and IgM are depleted. Calibrator assignment is established from replicate analyses using
a master set of calibrators and a specific lot of Reagent Packs on multiple BioPlex 2200
instruments. There are no known certified reference materials available for any of the
analytes in the Calibrator Set.
The calibrator set includes four distinct calibrator vials, instructions for use, and a lot specific
assigned calibrator values sheet. A Calibrator Lot Data CD-ROM is required to load the
necessary value assignment data into the instrument.
The calibrators are directly loaded into the BioPlex 2200 instrument sample racks and before
control or patient samples are processed, a multi-level series of calibrators is processed,
generating calibration curves for each analyte. Plotting Fluorescence Ratio (FR) against
analyte concentration, calibration curves are used to quantify analyte concentrations of
subsequent patient and control samples. The Calibrator Set should be loaded and assayed at
minimum in duplicate every 30 days or with each new lot of Reagent Pack.
A study was conducted to assess the onboard calibration stability for the BioPlex 2200
Vasculitis kit. Calibration curve stability is the ability to quantify controls and samples over
21

--- Page 22 ---
a period of time without a significant shift in quantitation. At day 0 multiple reagent packs
from a single lot were opened and placed on the analyzer. The reagent lot is calibrated and
controls are run to qualify the calibration curve. Calibrators and controls are run as samples
in duplicate every 7 days up to 35 days and quantified using the calibration curve from day 0.
Controls are run in 10 replicates on day 0 to establish a control mean. When controls and
calibrators are evaluated as samples, the results can be associated with a Serum Verification
Bead (SVB) sample error. Samples with results associated with these errors were not
repeated. However, no results are obtained for any sample that elicited sample dispense and
reagent dispense errors. At each time point control values are measured against a range
(established as two standard deviation from the mean control value from day 0 run). The
calibration curve is no longer acceptable if control values fall outside this range in
consecutive runs.
The data indicates that onboard calibration curves were stable for 35 days for all three assays,
supporting a 30 day stability claim. Additional calibration curve stability studies will be
conducted after 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months. The data appear adequate for the current
calibration curve stability claim.
Carryover
The BioPlex 2200 has one sample dispense probe for dispensing all patient samples. The
purpose of the sample probe carryover study was to quantify the amount of analyte that
might carry over on the sample probe from a high concentration sample into a subsequent
low concentration sample, causing a falsely elevated result.
The maximum allowable analyte carryover from the sample probe is 0.1 AI. Results are
reported by the BioPlex 2200 instrument to one decimal place (0.1 AI), so carryover below
this level is not measurable. Each of the three analytes was tested with a sample having a
high concentration. The high sample concentrations are:
Vasculitis Sample ID Concentration
Analyte (AI)
MPO 15625 30.0
PR3 15647 730.0
GBM 15627 110.0
For all the analytes tested, the low concentration sample was the Negative Control spiked
with the Positive Control. Supplementation was done to slightly elevate the concentration of
the low concentration sample and avoid quantitations <0.2 AI. The high concentration
sample was followed by three (3) aliquots of the low concentration sample. Aliquot #1 was
tested in a single replicate, aliquot #2 was tested in single replicate, and aliquot #3 was tested
in triplicate, producing five (5) replicates of the low concentration sample. This sequence
was repeated three more times, for a total of four repeating blocks. The sponsor notes that
future assay kits on the BioPlex 2200 can have sample dispense volumes of 50 μL. The
higher sample volume will increase the risk of sample probe carryover. The sponsor chose to
test carryover in the Vasculitis Kit using a high concentration sample volume of 50 μL. The
low concentration sample pool volume remained unchanged at 5 μL. The study was
performed on three different instruments per analyte. The mean was calculated for the first

low sample replicates following after the high concentration sample. This was the “test”
group and had the greatest risk of carryover. The mean was calculated of the low
concentration replicates #3-5. This was the “control” group, where no carryover was
expected.
Carryover was calculated as: Carryover (AI) = Mean AI – Mean AI
Test Control
A t-test (2 tailed) was performed on the test group vs. the control group to see if it was
statistically significant. Sample carryover met specifications for all the analytes (< 0.1 AI).
The sponsor additionally tested the reagent dispensing probe used to dispense all assay
reagents. The purpose of the reagent carryover study was to quantify the effect of reagent
that might carry over on the reagent probe from one reagent dispense into a subsequent
reagent dispense, causing a falsely suppressed or elevated result. The sponsor believed that
significant carryover might occur when the proposed assay is performed after the EBV IgM
assay. The EBV IgM assay contains in its Sample Diluent Reagent goat-anti-human-IgG.
Though the goat anti-human IgG antibody is necessary for the neutralization of human IgG in
the IgM assay, there is a risk that the anti-human IgG antibody might carry over into other
assays and cause interference. The proposed assay is a high-risk assay because it contains
mouse-anti-human-IgG-PE conjugate. A single run on one instrument was sufficient to test
all analytes in the proposed assay. The run was repeated on two additional instruments.
Forty-five replicates of the proposed assay’s Positive Control were tested in the run. The
instrument dispensing software and hardware movement created 13-19 opportunities among
the 45 replicates for the dispense of the EBV anti-human IgG reagent to be followed
immediately by the dispense of the proposed assay reagent. The instrument log was obtained
after the completion of the run, and was analyzed to classify the results into one of two
groups:
• Potential carryover- replicates with opportunities for the high-risk carryover combination.
• Baseline - replicates without opportunities for the high-risk carryover combination.
In both the groups the mean, SD, and CV were calculated. The %Carryover Effect and effect
ratio were calculated as follows:
Mean −Mean %CarryoverEffect
%CarryoverEffect=
Carryover baseline
×100 EffectRatio=
Mean %CV
baseline baseline
The specification for this assessment was: Any quantitation bias induced by reagent probe
carryover (the observed carryover effect) must be ≤ ±10%, or ≤2.0x CV (analogous to ≤2.0x
SD), from the control mean, whichever is greater. In an attached report summary, the sponsor
lists the following results:
