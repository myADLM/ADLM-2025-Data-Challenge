L. Test Principle:
The Evolution blood glucose test is based on measurement of electrical current caused by the
reaction of glucose with the reagents on the electrode of the test strip. The blood sample is
drawn into the end of the test strip through capillary action. Glucose in the sample reacts with
glucose oxidase and hexaammineruthenium (III) chloride, generating a current that is
proportional to the glucose concentration in the sample. The result is shown on the meter
display.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run Precision was measured by using EDTA anti-coagulated whole blood to
prepare samples at five different glucose concentrations. Each sample was tested 50
times. Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Heparinized venous whole blood was spiked or glycolyzed to 11 concentrations
between 27 mg/dL and 552 mg/dL (confirmed by YSI) then tested with the Evolution
and YSI. Each dilution was tested five times by the Evolution method and in
duplicate by YSI. Regression analysis showed a linear relationship between the
Evolution and the YSI method: y = 1.005x – 1.852, R = 0.999
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor provided the traceability and value assignment procedure for control
solutions used in this device. They are prepared at three target concentrations by
gravimetric addition of glucose to an aqueous matrix. The glucose concentration of
the control solutions are verified with the YSI reference method and expected values
are verified for each new manufactured lot of strips.
Shelf life studies show that the unopened test strips have a 26 month life-span and 3
months shelf-life once a vial of strips is opened. Unopened controls have a 26 month
shelf life and are stable for 3 months after first use.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor’s studies support their claimed detection limit of 20 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor evaluated the effect of hematocrit on whole blood samples spiked with
five hematocrit levels (between 20 – 60%) at eight glucose concentrations between 44
- 567 mg. These values were compared to values from an YSI-2300 analyzer. The
results indicated that bias introduced at hematocrit levels between 20% and 60% was
within ± 12%.
Temperature and humidity studies were performed and showed that the device can be
used from 50 – 104°F (10 to 40°C) and from 10% to 90% relative humidity. An
altitude study was performed and demonstrated that meter performance was
unaffected by altitudes ≤ 10,000 feet.

Common interferences were evaluated by spiking venous blood with glucose to two
concentrations. Each of these glucose concentrations was then spiked with the
interfering compound at two concentrations to make the interference samples. Control
samples were each spiked with the solvents used to make the interfering samples. For
the common interfering compounds shown below, no interference effects were
observed up to the concentration listed. No compound showed interference of ≥ ±

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
System accuracy was evaluated by comparing the results 613 fingertip samples
spanning the claimed assay range to the results obtained by a Hitachi 747. Samples
ranged from 32 – 576 mg/dL and followed the sample distribution recommended in
ISO 15197 Section 7.3.1.2. For some of the samples that were less than 40 mg/dL or
greater than 400 mg/dL, pooled anti-coagulated capillary whole blood specimen was
allowed to hydrolyze or was spiked to the desired glucose levels. Regression analysis
of the samples yielded the following results: y = 1.01x + 0.303 R2 = 0.9875.

98.7% of the individual samples were within the ISO 15197 criteria specifying 95%

LAY-USER STUDIES:
The sponsor conducted a series of studies to compare the accuracy of glucose
measurement between the lay-user and the healthcare professionals. Studies were
performed at three point-of-care (POC) sites and three physician’s office laboratories
(POL). At each POC site the lay-user performed a fingerstick, tested their blood with
the Evolution meter and recorded the result. A healthcare worker then obtained a
capillary blood sample and a venous sample for testing by a reference method
(Hitachi 747). At the three POL sites the lay-user performed a fingerstick, tested their
blood with the Evolution meter. At Site 1 and 3 they also tested their blood with a
One Touch Ultra and an Accu-Chek Active, respectively. At Site 2 a healthcare
worker obtained a sample to be tested on an YSI 3000.
All sites met the ISO 15197 acceptability criteria of individual differences within
±15mg/dL deviation for glucose concentrations of <75 mg/dL and ±20% deviation
for glucose concentrations of ≥75 mg/dL.

The sponsor assessed readability of the labeling by recruiting 100 lay users who were
provided with the test kit containing labeling for the US market. Participants varied in
age, education, country of origin, and were about evenly divided between men and
women. Regression analysis of the participant’s fingerstick value against a laboratory
method (Hitachi 747) yielded the following results: y = 1.01x - 2.84, R2 = 0.9897.
Results of this study met the ISO 15197 acceptability criteria of individual differences
within ±15mg/dL deviation for glucose concentrations of <75 mg/dL and ±20%
deviation for glucose concentrations of ≥75 mg/dL.
AST STUDIES:
The sponsor conducted alternative site testing (AST) using the ventral palm, the
dorsal hand, the forearm, the upper arm, the calf, and the thigh and compared the
results to concurrent fingerstick readings. Lay-users vigorously rubbed the alternative
site for 5 - 10 seconds (until they felt warming) before obtaining the sample.
Regression results are shown below and the percentage of results meeting ISO-15197
acceptance criteria for accuracy.

5. Calibration:
A color tag on the back of the test strips provides lot specific calibration information. No
calibration by the user is required.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at three different concentrations can be run with this device.
When a test strip is inserted into the meter, the control mode can be activated. This
prevents control results from being stored in the internal memory. An acceptable range
for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to
use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
The sponsor demonstrated acceptable performance across the claimed glucose range for
blood volumes ≥ 0.3 ul.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
