K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The EliA dsDNA wells are coated with double-stranded plasmid DNA. If present in
the patient’s specimen, antibodies to gliadin will bind to their specific antigen in the
wells. After washing away non-bound antibodies, enzyme- labeled antibodies against
human IgG antibodies (EliA IgG conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate
complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away and the bound
complex is incubated with a development solution. After stopping the reaction, the
fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The higher the response value, the
more specific IgG is present in the specimen. To evaluate test results, the response
for patient samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators.
The EliA IgG calibration is a total IgG calibration. It is based on a set of six WHO-
standardized IgG calibrators derived from human serum. The calibrators are required
to perform an initial calibration curve, which can be stored in the ImmunoCAP
instrument and may be used up to 28 days. Each assay outside of a calibration run
includes curve controls that have to fall within defined ranges to verify that the stored
calibration curve is still valid.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
For the ImmunoCAP 100, three samples were measured on three
instruments in 36 runs with a calibration curve in each run. For the
ImmunoCAP 250, three samples were measured on three instruments in 3
replicates in 21 runs with a calibration curve in each run.

Additional studies were done on three ImmunoCAP 100 instruments for
equivocal samples around 15 IU/mL and a high positive sample. The
samples were tested in 3 replicates in 18 runs (total 54 replicates) over 6
days. The studies yielded the following:

6 273.3 5.4 7.8
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was not claimed for this device.
High dose hook effect:
For EliA dsDNA, the possibility of antigen excess occurring when using the
device was evaluated with serum sample above the calibrator 600 ug/mL. The
device was able to discriminate the high positive sample diluted 1:10 (~6,000
ug/L) from the highest calibrator point showing no hook effect.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The IgG calibrators are traceable to the International Reference Preparation
(IRP) 67/86 of Human Immunoglobulins A, G, and M from WHO. New
batches of IgG calibrators are compared to a secondary standard (standardized
with the IRP) or the IRP directly and adjusted accordingly to meet the correct
concentration (6 levels). The instrument measures specific IgG concentrations
in µg/L. To obtain a test specific result, µg/L of IgG must be converted to
EliA U/mL using a conversion factor given by the lot-specific code of the
EliA dsDNA well.
EliA ANA Control is prepared from selected pooled human sera containing
IgG antibodies to dsDNA, RNP, Sm, Ro, La, Scl-70, CENP and Jo-1. The
controls are prediluted and ready for use. The acceptance ranges for the
current control lot are stated on the Control Certificate included in the
respective EliA ANA Control kit. The mean values for every lot have been
determined with 4 consecutive control assays, each in 6 replicates. Ranges are

calculated as respective mean ± 3SD for the expected long term variation.
Open-vial stability is not tested as the EliA ANA control is packaged in single
vials. Closed-vial stability studies were performed to investigate the
accelerated stability claim of 24 months. According to internal specifications
4 weeks at +30oC correspond to one year storage at +4oC and 8 weeks at
+30oC correspond to two years storage at +4oC. For approved stability, the
quotas (stressed/reference) for positive signal should be within 0.80 to 1.20.
Specifications were met.
d. Detection limit:
The lower limit of the measuring range was determined by measuring
dilutions (1:2, 1:4, and 1:8) of Calibrator 4.0 (4.0 µg/L) in the Calibrator
Wells. The results in Response Units (RU) were compared with the result of
the sample diluent on EliA dsDNA Wells. The discrimination ability (D) of
the assay should be >2.0. All samples were measured in triplicate.

The 1/8 diluted calibrator 4.0 (0.5 µg/L) still can be discriminated from
background given by the signal of the diluent on dsDNA wells. The lower
limit of detection was set at 0.5µg /L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering substance
Two diluted positive serum samples were spiked with bilirubin C, bilirubin F,
hemoglobin, chyle and rheumatoid factor. The same samples were also
spiked with specific blanks. 990 µL diluted serum was spiked with 10 µL
substance or blank. For rheumatoid factor, 900 µL serum were spiked with
100 µL interference substance. The samples were tested in 3 replicates. A
calibration curve was run in each assay. The runs were repeated twice. The
following sample concentrations of additives were reached.

Negative% agreement = 100.0% (44/44) (95%CI 92-100)
b. Matrix comparison:
Forty six sets of samples from different donors were tested in double
determinations. Sample demographics were not provided. Each set contained
serum, EDTA, heparin and citrate plasma samples. For positive and equivocal
serum samples quotas between serum and each type of plasma were
calculated. Mean quota of plasma to serum concentration should be 0.8-1.2
for positive sera. Negative samples should not switch to positive in all serum
and plasma samples. Linear regression comparing the quotas between serum
and each type of plasma for the positive samples was performed and showed:
n Slope Intercept Correlation

EDTA 95%CI: 0.981-1.051 (95%CI: 0.007, 0.199)
The specifications for this study are fulfilled for serum, heparin, EDTA and
citrate plasma samples. This information is specified on the Specimen
Collection section of the Package Insert.
c. Instrument Platform comparison:
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the performance of EliA
dsDNA is equivalent on the ImmunoCAP 100 and the ImmunoCAP 250.
For this comparison study, a total of 59 samples distributed over the
measuring range were assayed: 4 negative samples, 32 positive samples and
23 high positive samples. All samples were run on three ImmunoCAP 100
instruments and two ImmunoCAP 250 instruments in two runs and in single
replicates. The specification for correlation is that the systems are considered
equal if the true average difference is less than ± 5% with no linear trends and

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Clinical Specificity:
None provided.
b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. is not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The purpose of the normal sera studies was to evaluate expected values in the
normal population and to confirm the defined cut-off. Samples from 400
apparently healthy Caucasian adult blood donors were measured. The individuals
were equally distributed by sex and age. Results were tabulated on the table
below:
IU/mL
Median 1.4
Mean 2.4
Mean +2SD 10.7
Mean +3SD 14.9
95th Percentile 6.3
99th Percentile 17.3
The results appeared to be equally distributed and not dependent on age or gender.
The 95th percentile lies below the lower limit of the equivocal range of 10-15
IU/mL.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
