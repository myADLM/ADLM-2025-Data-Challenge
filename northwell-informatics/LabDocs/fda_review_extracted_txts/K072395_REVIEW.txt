Additional precision studies were performed at or near the clinical significant
ranges of HDL. These precision studies of the Diazyme HDL- Cholesterol
Reagent were evaluated using the CLSI EP5-A guideline. In the study three
levels of serum samples were tested with 2 runs per day in duplicate over 5
days. Testing was performed on the Roche Diagnostics Hitachi 917.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity determination was based upon NCCLS (CLSI) EP6-A and was
performed on the Roche Diagnostics Hitachi 917. Each level was measured in
triplicate. Samples were serially diluted from a level of 184.18 to 0 mg/dL.
The linearity for this method is 1.06 – 184.8 mg/dL, Y=0.998x+0.7275,
r2=0.9999. The sponsor determined an acceptable % error was ≤ 10%.Results
of the study support the claimed linearity range.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device has not been certified or tested by the Cholesterol Reference
Method Laboratory Network. The NIST SRM 1915b material was tested with
the Diazyme HDL-Cholesterol reagent and found to have a deviation from the
NIST target value of 1.9% for level I (48.7 mg/dL) and -3.4% for level II
(51.9 mg/dL).
Values are assigned to the control materials by repeat testing on the Hitachi
917 using the Diazyme HDL-cholesterol reagent and calibrator. The assigned
ranges which are lot specific are as follows: Level I 23-35 mg/dL; Level II 44-
66 mg/dL and Level III 74-110 mg/dL.
Reagent Stability: Reagents from two lots were stored in incubators at 37oC,
25oC and 4oC. Reagents were tested at 0 day, 2 days, 6 days, 9 days and 12
days. Accelerated study results show that the reagent is stable for up to 12
months when stored at 2-8oC. Real time studies are being conducted and

adjustments to shelf life will be made as needed. Stability on board the Hitachi
917 was studied by storing the two reagents (R1 and R2) in the 2-8oC storage
chamber of the Hitachi 917. Results indicate the reagents are suitable for on
board storage for up to 30 days.
Calibrator Stability: Calibrators from two lots were stored in incubators at
37oC, 25oC and 4oC. The calibrators were removed from storage a
predetermined times and tested with the Diazyme HDL-Cholesterol reagent.
The accuracy of the Calibrators was determined by testing HDL-C samples of
know concentrations determined by the predicate kit. The shelf life of the
calibrators was determined to be 12 months at 2-8oC. Real time studies are
being conducted and adjustments to shelf life will be made as needed.
Control Stability: Controls from two lots were stored in incubators at 37oC,
25oC and 4oC. The controls were removed from storage at predetermined
times and tested in duplicate with the Diazyme HDL-Cholesterol reagent. The
accuracy of the controls was determined by testing HDL-C samples of know
concentrations determined by the predicate kit. The shelf life of the control
materials was determined to be 12 months at 2-8oC. Open vial stability for
controls was determined to be one month. Real time studies are being
conducted and adjustments to shelf life will be made as needed.
d. Detection limit:
To demonstrate the limit of blank of Diazyme HDL-Cholesterol, HDL zero
calibrator was tested in 12 replicates on the Hitachi 917. The Limit of blank is
defined as the mean + 3SD. N = 12, Mean = 0.37, SD = 0.27 LOD = 1.06. To
determine the limit of quantitation (LOQ), a serum sample was diluted into 5
other concentrations and assayed over 3 days with 2 runs per day for a total of
150 replicates on the Hitachi 917. The five concentrations were 0.30, 0.75,
1.50, 3.00 and 5.00 mg/dL. In the study, the estimated LOQ where the inter-
assay CV is 20% was 1.39 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
To determine the level of interference from substance normally present in
human serum, the Diazyme HDL-Cholesterol Assay was tested with normal
serum samples containing about 34 mg/dL HDL-C spiked with various
concentrations of interference substances following CLSI guideline EP7-A
and was performed on the Roche Diagnostics Hitachi 917. The following
substance normally present in serum produced less than 10% deviation when
tested at levels equal to the following concentrations:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 84 samples (68 non-altered, 16 altered) were compared with the
Equal HDL Ultra Cholesterol and calibrator on the Hitachi 917.
Y = 1.0484x-4.6906, r2 = 0.9871. Samples ranged from 7.17 to 181.84 mg/dL
were tested based upon recommendations in NCCLS (CLSI) EP-9A2
guidance.
b. Matrix comparison:
Samples were compared between serum and EDTA, citrate and heparin
plasma on the Hitachi 917. Samples were compared across the measuring
range, from 14.03 to 184.4 mg/dL some samples were spiked or diluted to
cover the entire range.
Serum vs EDTA plasma Y = 1.0264X + 1.1334, R2 = 0.9959
Serum vs Citrate plasma Y = 1.0661X + 2.0933, R2 = 0.996
