L. Test Principle:
The Elecsys® proBNP II Test System is an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay
(ECLIA). The test uses the sandwich principle. In the first incubation, antigen in the
sample, a biotinylated monoclonal NT-proBNP-specific antibody and a monoclonal
NT-proBNP-specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium complex form a sandwich
complex. In the second incubation, after addition of streptavidin labeled micro-
particles, the complex produced is bound to the solid phase via biotin-streptavidin
interaction. The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the

microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound
substances are then removed with ProCell. Application of a voltage to the electrode
then induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier.
Results are determined via a calibration curve. This curve is instrument-specifically
generated by a 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent
barcode.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was determined using Elecsys reagents, pooled human sera,
and controls in a modified protocol (EP5-A) of the CLSI (Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute; formerly NCCLS): 6 times daily for 10
days (n = 60); within-run precision on MODULAR ANALYTICS E170
analyzer, n = 21. The following results were obtained:
5

--- Page 6 ---
An additional precision study was performed on the Elecsys 2010 on two
samples with mean concentrations of 341.7 and 754.4 pg/mL which bracket
the cutoff of 450 pg/mL for patients 75 years and older. Within run precision
was determined for 21 replicates of each sample with CV 1.2% and 1.0%
respectively. Total precision for the two samples was 2.3 % CV and 3.4 %
respectively.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The assay reportable range is from 5-35,000 pg/mL. In the first study, the
linearity was evaluated by diluting four patient samples with varying amounts
6

--- Page 7 ---
of pro-BNP-free serum (10 concentrations per sample) and measured in
triplicate on the MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 analyzer. The sponsor
provided the data for 4 samples. Each sample was diluted with varying
amounts of proBNP-free serum (11 concentrations per sample). Analysis of
the linearity data was performed according to CLSI EP6-A. Because the
precision data is proportional to concentration, the calculations were done on
percentage difference scale rather than absolute difference scale. If the device
is without measurement error and linear, then the percent recovery should be
1.00 (100%). For 44 measurements of recoveries, the assumption about
constant standard deviation through entire range is acceptable. According to
EP6-A, the linearity data should be analyzed with regard to linear, quadratic
and cubic polynomials. The best fitted linear model for the percent recoveries
was 0.9604 – 9E-07x. The data demonstrated that the E170 analyzer was
linear from 5 – 35,000 pg/mL with deviation from linearity not more than
15%.
In the second study, six patient samples were diluted with varying amounts of
diluent (10 concentrations per sample) and measured in triplicate on the
Elecsys 2010 analyzer. The samples ranged from 2.3 – 53,849 pg/mL. The
data was analyzed according to CLSI EP6-A. Because the precision data is
proportional to concentration, the calculations were done on percentage
difference scale rather than absolute difference scale. If the device is without
measurement error and linear, then the percent recovery should be 1.00
(100%). For 60 measurements of recoveries, the assumption about constant
standard deviation through entire range is acceptable. According to EP6-A,
the linearity data should be analyzed with regard to linear, quadratic and cubic
polynomials. The best fitted linear model for the percent recoveries was 0.933
– 1E-07x. The data demonstrated that the Elecsys 2010 analyzer was linear
from 5 – 35,000 pg/mL with deviation from linearity not more than 10 %.
Hook effect studies demonstrated no effect up to 300,000 pg/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Elecsys proBNP II CalSet
Summary of traceability: Elecsys proBNP II CalSet is traceable
gravimetrically to an in house reference prepared by weighing pure synthetic
NT-proBNP (1-76) into an equine serum matrix.
On board/open vial stability: Stability of the reconstituted Elecsys proBNP II
CalSet for the Elecsys proBNP II assay was determined by studies on Elecsys
2010 analyzer. Onboard stability of Elecsys proBNP II CalSet after
reconstitution is claimed for up to 5 hours at 20 – 25°C. Reconstituted
calibrators were stored at 4 °C for two weeks and within this period they were
7

--- Page 8 ---
incubated at 32 °C for 5 hours. Each calibrator was tested in two-fold
determinations. The signal percent recovery was within ± 10%.
Storage at -20°C: Elecsys proBNP II CalSet is claimed to be stable for three
months at -20°C. Reconstituted calibrators were incubated for three months at
-20°C and tested twice subsequently to determine the % recovery relative to
the calibrators stored at 4°C. The signal percent recovery was within ± 10%.
Real-Time Stability: Elecsys proBNP II CalSet kits were stored at 2-8°C for
19 months. Real-time stability claims were established by testing the aged
Calibrators with Elecsys PreciControl Cardiac II in two-fold determinations.
Percent recovery was determined relative to the assigned target value. The
shelf-life of Elecsys proBNP II CalSet is claimed to be 18 months with the kit
unopened and stored at 2-8°C. The percent recovery was within ± 10%.
PreciControl Cardiac II:
On board /open vial stability: Onboard stability of Elecsys PreciControl
Cardiac II after reconstitution was determined by studies on Elecsys 2010
analyzer. Onboard stability is claimed for up to 3 hours at 20 – 25°C.
Reconstituted controls I and II were kept for three days at 4°C. Once per day
they were stored at 22 °C for one hour. Each PreciControl was tested in two-
fold determinations. The signal percent recovery was within ± 10%.
Stability after at -20°C storage: Elecsys PreciControl Cardiac II is claimed to
be stable for 3 months at -20°C. Reconstituted controls I and II were stored for
3 months at -20°C and tested with two-fold determinations to determine the %
recovery with reference to the calibrators stored at 4°C. The signal percent
recovery was within ± 10%.
Real-Time Stability: Elecsys PreciControl Cardiac II kits were stored at 2-8°C
and measured at determined time intervals for 19 months. Each PreciControl
was tested in two-fold determinations and % recovery was determined to the
assigned target value. The shelf-life of Elecsys PreciControl Cardiac II is
claimed to be 18 month with the kit unopened and stored at 2-8°C. The
percent recovery was within ± 10%.
Summary of value assignment: PreciControl Cardiac II values are assigned
using a minimum of 3 Elecsys 1010 analyzers, 3 Elecsys 2010/cobas e 411
and 3 Elecsys MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 / cobas e 601. A minimum of
6 runs are performed on each analyzer platform. Two-fold determinations are
made for each sample. The target value is then calculated as the median of the
determined values. Target ranges for PreciControl Cardiac II are established at
± 12% of the target value. Lot specific target values are established.

d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) was evaluated on the Elecsys 2010 and MODULAR
ANALYTICS E170 analyzers according to CLSI EP17-A guidelines. Five
human serum samples with low analyte concentration were measured on 2
analyzers in 3 runs per instrument. The samples were measured in duplicate
in each run (n = 30). The LoD was determined to be 1.725 pg/mL for the
Elecsys 2010 and 3.62 pg/mL for the E170. The labeling includes values for
the limit of detection and limit of quantitation.
The limit of detection (LoD) was evaluated on the Elecsys 2010 and
MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 analyzer according to CLSI EP 17-A
guidelines. Five human serum samples with low analyte concentration were
measured on analyzers in 3 runs per instrument. The samples were measured
in duplicate in each run (n = 30). The limit of detection is determined based on
the limit of blank and the standard deviation of low concentration samples.
The LoD was determined to be 2.83 pg/mL for the Elecsys 2010 and 4.66
pg/mL for the E170. The sponsor claims a LoD of 5 pg/mL.
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was determined on the Elecsys 2010 and E170
by measuring the concentration which corresponds to an interassay CV of 20
%. To determine the LoQ for the Elecsys 2010, 8 samples (6 human serum
pools and 2 controls) with concentrations ranging from 2.39 to 2367.2 were
tested once per day for 10 days. The mean standard deviation and CV for each
sample was calculated. The concentration which would generate a 20% CV
was determined to be < 14.0 pg/mL. For the E170, 10 samples (8 human
serum pools and 2 controls) with concentrations ranging from 7.62 to 2168.8
were tested once per day for 10 days. The mean, standard deviation and CV
for each sample were calculated. The concentration which would generate a
20 % CV was determined to be < 7.62 pg/mL. The sponsor claims the LoQ of
50 pg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The assay is unaffected by icterus (bilirubin < 428 μmol/L or < 25 mg/dL),
hemolysis (Hb < 0.621 mmol/L or < 1.0 g/dL), lipemia (intralipids < 17.1
mmol/L or < 1500 mg/dL), and biotin < 82 nmol/L or < 30 ng/mL.
In patients receiving therapy with high biotin doses (i.e. > 5 mg/day), no
sample should be taken until at least 8 hours after the last biotin
administration. No interference was observed from rheumatoid factors up to a
concentration of 1500 IU/mL. In vitro tests were performed on 51 commonly
used pharmaceuticals. No interference with the assay was found. In rare cases,
interference due to extremely high titers of antibodies to streptavidin and
ruthenium can occur.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Accuracy was evaluated in a study comparing the values obtained with the
Elecsys proBNP II assay to the values obtained with the Elecsys proBNP
assay on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer. A total of 1551 samples were tested from
three subgroups: Subgroup A (USA, 207 samples), Subgroup B (Europe, 328
samples) and Subgroup C (Europe, 1016 samples).
A comparison of the Elecsys proBNP II assay (y) with the Elecsys proBNP
assay (x) using 1551 clinical samples with values ranging from 5 to 32,627
pg/mL gave the following correlations (pg/mL):
Passing/Bablok Linear regression
y = 0.979x - 0.314 y = 1.00x - 21.9
τ = 0.932 r = 0.996
The sponsor provided concordance testing on reference and diseased group
samples determined by comparing the results from the modified Elecsys
proBNP II assay and the Elecsys proBNP assay. The concordance testing was
performed on a subset of samples from the USA subgroup (Subgroup A), a
subset of samples from Subgroup B and a subset of blood donor samples
blood samples from Subgroup C. The reference group study examined
samples from diabetic and hypertensive patients and from blood donors. The
disease study group consisted of samples from each of the New York Heart
Association (NYHA) classes (I – IV). The cut-offs of 125 pg/mL for patients
< 75 years of age, and 450 pg/mL for patients ≥ years of age were used in the
concordance determination. Concordance for the reference groups were 97.6
% for diabetics and hypertensives (94/96) and 99.0% for blood donors
(607/613). Concordance for the disease group was 99% for Class I (142/143),
100% for Class II (159/159), 100 % for Class III (66/66), and 100% for Class
IV (11/11).
In addition, concordance was evaluated in a study comparing the values
obtained with the Elecsys proBNP II assay to the values obtained with the
Elecsys proBNP assay using the samples from the USA Subgroup (Subgroup
A). These samples were repository samples from the clinical studies
performed in support of k022516, Elecsys proBNP assay. A comparison of
10

--- Page 11 ---
the Elecsys proBNP II assay (y) with the Elecsys proBNP assay (x) using the
207 clinical samples with values ranging from 5 to 11,258 pg/mL gave the
following correlations (pg/mL):
