the reagents contained on the strip’s electrodes. The glucose in the sample is oxidized by the
enzyme glucose oxidase, and the current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured
and converted to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is
proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated the within run and between run precision of the device using
50 replicate measurements of 5 concentrations of glucose-adjusted venous whole
blood with 3 strip lots. Results are summarized below.
Within-Run Precision
Average glucose concentration 45.8 81.2 128 215 346
(mg/dL)
SD (mg/dL) 3.0 3.6 4.8 6.0 6.6
CV (%) 6.6 4.4 3.8 2.8 1.9
Between Run Precision
Average glucose concentration 46.5 77.2 130.4 223.9 349.6
(mg/dL)
SD (mg/dL) 3.4 3.7 5.5 6.6 6.8
CV (%) 7.3 4.8 4.2 3.0 1.9
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To establish the linearity of the system through the range of 20 to 600 mg/dL, glucose
adjusted whole blood samples (actual range tested was 25 to 572 mg/dL) were
compared to YSI 2300 using 50 replicate measurements of 5 concentrations of
glucose-adjusted venous whole blood with 3 strip lots Linear regression yields the
following statistics:
Slope y-intercept r2
Strip Lot 1 0.998 0.458 0.999
Strip Lot 2 0.999 -0.120 0.999
Strip Lot 3 1.007 -0.500 0.999
The sponsor claims 20 mg/dL as the lowest detectable limit in the labeling.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The controls were evaluated in the predicate device (k052818). The evaluation of the
controls in that submission is described below:
Traceability has been referenced by the manufacturer to ISO 17511.
The three control solutions consist of buffered aqueous solutions of D (+)-glucose
containing stabilizers, preservatives, and other non-reactive ingredients. Lot-specific
ranges are printed on the EZ Smart-168 Test Strip bottle label. The control values are

assigned by repeat testing. Mean values are obtained and ranges are assigned based
upon the mean value ± a pre-determined value for each control concentration.
Closed Vial Stability of Control Solution: The sponsor assessed control solution
stability using accelerated and real time aging studies. Five EZ Smart-168 meters and
the YSI 2300 Stat Plus analyzer were used during the testing procedure. The shelf life
stability claim is 24 months.
Opened Vial Stability of Control Solution: The sponsor conducted open vial stability
studies of control solutions (Level 1, 2, and 3) that were stored at room temperature
(15°-28° C). Samples were tested every week for 4 consecutive weeks, then every
other week for the second month, and every month for the 3 rd to 6th months. Five
EZ Smart-168 glucose meters and the YSI 2300 STAT PLUS were used during the
testing procedure. The open vial stability claim of the control solutions is 3 months
after opening.
The device is traceable to a laboratory analyzer which is calibrated to a glucose
standard (NIST SRM 965a).
Stability characteristics of the control solutions were determined using real time aging
studies. The open vial storage stability at room temperature was determined to be 18
months and unopened vial stability was determined to be 24 months.
The expected ranges of the glucose control solutions were established by repeat
testing (10 times) on two meters using one lot of strips for both glucose levels.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the system is 20 - 600 mg/dL as established in k052818.
This range was verified by the linearity study (above section M.1.b.).
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor tested the following substances for interference according to NCCLS
EP7-P. Blood samples were drawn from healthy volunteers, mixed, and the
interfering chemicals or control samples (saline) were added. Parallel testing was
used to compare glucose measurements in the presence and absence of drugs using
heparinized venous blood from healthy volunteers. The low and high venous blood
glucose concentrations in this study were 61 and 200 mg/dL respectively. For each
drug level, one control sample (no interferant) and four test samples with serial
dilution concentration were prepared. Control samples were measured by each device
to serve as the reference measurement for each glucose test. Each sample was
measured in duplicate (glucose concentration 61 mg/dL and 200 mg/dL). Results
were averaged for the control samples (n=5) and for the four parallel test samples
(n=5). Results are summarized below:

An altitude study was performed with venous blood spiked with 5 different
concentrations of glucose spanning 70 to 400 mg/dL, and capillary whole blood from
volunteers whose blood glucose ranged from 74 to 99 mg/dL. The altitude study was
performed at 164, 7545, and 9875 feet and demonstrated that both the venous and
capillary blood tests met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of ±15% at altitudes of
7545 feet and below..
To test the effect of hematocrit on the device accuracy, blood adjusted to hematocrit
levels of 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, and 60% at glucose concentrations of
48.6, 86.5, 148, 236, 383 mg/dL were tested a total of 6 times, averaged and
compared to the YSI result. The study demonstrated a bias of < 10% when samples
within the claimed hematocrit range of 35% to 55% were compared to YSI.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A consumer study on samples ranging from 56.7 to 471 mg/dL was performed with
121 lay-users and a technician. An additional 17 samples were contrived to produce
low and high sample values, ranging from 24.2 to 54.3 mg/dL and 487 to 581 mg/dL.
The labeling provided to the users was in English only. Each participant performed
their own fingerstick and tested their blood using only the instructions in the user’s

N. Instrument Name:
EZ Scan Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ______
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm, or
forearm only. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are
no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
A code number is provided with each batch of test strips to calibrate the meter for that
batch. The code number is associated with the meter by inserting a test strip and entering
the code number to match that found on the test strip bottle. No further calibrations are
required of the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor has three levels of controls available for this meter with one level coming
with the kit and the other two levels being available through the distributor. When a test
strip is inserted into the meter, a control can be run. An acceptable range for each control
level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is referred to a troubleshooting
section of the owner’s manual to identify possible reasons control results may fall outside
these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
None.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
