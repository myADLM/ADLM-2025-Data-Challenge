disc and to allow capture of the eluted TSH by the antibody immobilized onto the
microplate wells. Following incubation the plates are washed to remove the sample
discs as well as the eluate.
A second antibody, a ß-specific anti-hTSH monoclonal conjugated to the enzyme
horseradish-peroxidase (HRP), is then added to the wells and incubated. The eluted
TSH of the sample already captured by the microplate-bound antibody is bound by
the enzyme-conjugated monoclonal antibody added. An antibody-TSH-antibody
bridge, or "sandwich", forms that is bound to the surface of the microplate wells. Any
unbound complexes are removed with subsequent plate washings.
The final stage of the assay is the detection of the microwell-bound complexes by the
addition of a color developing reagent. The enzyme (HRP) portion of the bound
“sandwich” reacts with the color developer, 3, 3’, 5, 5’-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)
in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H O ). The TMB/ H O liquid is converted
2 2 2 2
from colorless to blue. The degree of color change is directly proportional to the
amount of TSH antigen that is bound in the well. The color development is
terminated with the addition of a color stopper that converts the blue to yellow.
The results are measured with a microplate reader at a wavelength of 450 nm. The
absorbance measured is directly proportional to the concentration of TSH in the
sample. A standard curve is generated by plotting the light absorbance of each
standard versus its known TSH concentration. The concentrations of TSH in the
unknown samples are determined by interpolation from this standard curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor states that precision was evaluated following the Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Protocol EP5-A2.
Three Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Neonate Screening Quality Control
Program samples (CDC 611, 612, and 613) and two other dried blood spot
samples C1 and C2 with TSH values ranging from approximately 14 to 87
µIU/mL were tested in duplicate, one run per day, for 20 days, for a total of
n=40. Since the testing was performed using dried blood spots, the extraction
procedure was captured in the testing process. The imprecison for these
samples ranged from 7.9-13.9 % coefficient of variation (% CV). The results
are presented in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range is stated to be 2.4-120 µIU/mL. The claim is supported
by data from the sponsor’s linearity study and detection limit study. Samples
were prepared from a commercially obtained, human, analyte-stripped serum-
sample, supplemented with purified analyte weighed gravimetrically to
produce a 1.5 μIU/mL, 25 μIU/mL, and 200 μIU/mL TSH concentrations. The
range of low-level, mid-level and high-level samples were prepared by
making multiple volume combinations of these. Then each prepared serum-
sample was then combined with lysed, commercially obtained, human, red
blood cells to achieve the equivalent of a 55% hematocrit. The resulting
samples were then spotted onto blood collection filter paper and dried.
Observed values were compared to the expected values and the percent (%)
recovery ranged from 88 to 114%, with a mean recovery of 95%.
Linear regression analysis resulted in the following equation:
y= 0.8997x + 0.6036, r2= 0.999.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators and controls are prepared from commercially available TSH
analyte that is traceable to WHO 3rd IRP of human TSH 81/565. The target
TSH levels for the controls 15, 30, and 80 μIU/mL are suitable given the
clinical decision decision points for Normal, Borderline, and Abnormal
(Hypothyroid).
Targeted values are verified by testing in the TSH assay standardized with
CDC-issued TSH calibrators and Reference Standards traceable to WHO 3rd
IRP of human TSH 81/565.
Control values and expected ranges are assigned by repeat analysis on
multiple TSH assays.
To support shelf-life claims, dried blood spots used to prepare calibrator and

control materials are stored at 2-8°C for 18, 19, and 20 months. The sponsor’s
stability testing protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and
determined to be adequate.
d. Detection limit:
The TSH test kit zero standard was used to prepare dried blood spots (n=20)
that were then punched and tested in a single assay run. The sponsor defines
Analytical Limit at Low Levels as the calculated concentration in μIU/mL
serum equivalents that corresponds to the mean of the absorbance value of the
zero standard plus two times the standard deviation (+2SD). This value was
calculated to be 2.4 μIU/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The cross-reactivity of three structurally related compounds, Follicle
Stimulating Hormone (FSH-WHO 2nd IRP HMG), Luteinizing Hormone (LH-
WHO 1st IRP 68/40)), and human Chorionic Gonadotrophic hormone (hCG-
WHO 2nd IS 61/6)), were evaluated. Each compound was added to TSH-free
whole blood which had been adjusted to 55% hematocrit and then spotted on
filter paper to create dried blood spots. FSH concentrations up to 500 μIU/mL,
LH up to μIU/mL, and hCG concentration up to 100,000 μIU/mL were
undetectable (< 2.4 μIU/mL) in the assay.
Interference by elevated lipid, bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated) and
hemoglobin was evaluated. The levels of lipid and bilirubin tested were based
on recommendations in CLSI EP7-A. The sponsor defined interference as an
observed test value is greater than ± 1 standard deviation of the mean of the
matching control value.
Lipid at a concentration of 1350 mg/dL was added to whole blood specimens
containing approximately 16, 46, and 85 μIU/mL TSH and tested along with
the same specimens without added interferant. Specimens containing 1350
mg/dL lipid had TSH values within ± 1 standard deviation of the mean of the
matching control value and did not adversely affect the interpretation of
“Normal” or “Hypothyroid” (Abnormal) results.
Conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin at a concentration of 20 mg/dL were
added separately to whole blood specimens containing approximately 14, 27,
and 68 μIU/mL TSH and tested along with the same specimens without added
interferant. Specimens containing 20 mg/dL bilirubin had TSH values within
± 1 standard deviation of the mean of the matching control value and did not
adversely affect the interpretation of “Normal” or “Hypothyroid” (Abnormal)
results.

--- Page 7 ---
The effect of hemoglobin up to 18.7 g/dL was evaluated. This level is the
highest expected hemoglobin level in neonates, according to the sponsor’s
search of the literature. Specimens with TSH concentration of approximately
13, 27 and 68 μIU/mL were tested with and without additional hemoglobin,
17 and 18.7 g/dL respectively. Specimens containing 18.7 g/dL had TSH
values within ± 1 standard deviation of the mean of the matching control
value and did not adversely affect the interpretation of “Normal” or
“Hypothyroid” (Abnormal) results.
The labeling contains a limitation that any physiological state that will cause
marked alterations in hematocrit and/or protein concentration may adversely
affect the validity of the TSH concentration obtained.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 995 neonatal dried blood spot specimens were obtained from a state
public health laboratory’s routine screening program bank of specimens. Nine-
hundred eighty (980) were randomly selected from the (previously screened and
presumed) normal population of banked specimens; and 15 were selected from
patients confirmed as positive for hypothyroidism.
Testing of the samples was performed with the GBI TSH assay and the predicate
method. The results are shown in the following table:

Linear regression analysis of samples with numeric values within the reportable
range of the devices (n=832) yielded the following equation:
y (GBI TSH) = 1.07x (predicate) + 0.27, r2 = 0.92
Of the fifteen (15) confirmed hypothyroid samples, the majority exceeded the
reportable range of the device. To further demonstrate performance at the Positive
cut-off of 40 μIU/ml additional testing of fifteen (n=15) spiked samples ranging in
TSH value from 40-60 μIU/ml was performed on the GBI TSH test and the
predicate device. The results are summarized in the table below:

The package insert states that a variety of factors will determine the normal range
for neonatal TSH concentrations. Demographic variations, the age and weight of
the infant at sample collection, multiple births and infants born prematurely are all
factors which can affect the cut-off values for normal concentrations of TSH in a
neonatal screening program. For these reasons each laboratory should establish
normal ranges and cut-off values for their individual application.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
