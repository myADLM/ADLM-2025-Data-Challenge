I. Device Description:
The Wondfo One Step hCG Urine/Serum Test will be sold in two formats: test strip and
cassette. The test strip kit consists of one test device and a package insert. The cassette kit
consists of one test device, a disposable plastic dropper, and a package insert. Each test device
contains mouse monoclonal anti-ß HCG antibody coated membrane and a pad containing
mouse monoclonal anti- α hCG antibody colloidal gold conjugate. The control antibodies are
goat anti-mouse IgG.

L. Test Principle:
The Wondfo One Step HCG test uses a monoclonal antibody against purified β-hCG. The kit
is a rapid qualitative assay based on the principle of double antibodies sandwich
immunoassay. When the strip is immersed in a urine or serum sample, the urine/serum
migrates upward. The hCG is first captured by monoclonal antibodies to β-hCG in the
sample pad and then by monoclonal antibodies to α-hCG on the T line and anti-mouse IgG
on the C line coated in the membrane. If the hCG is at or above 25 mIU/ml red bands
appear both in T line and C line which indicates a positive result. If the hCG is below 25
mIU/ml, only the red band in C line should appear. The band at the C line indicates sufficient
volume has been added.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
High dose hook effect was evaluated by spiking high hCG concentrations into
negative urine and serum samples and evaluating the test result lines. The
concentrations tested ranged from 10 mIU/mL to 500 IU/mL. Each sample was tested
in triplicate. Results indicate that for urine/serum samples with HCG > 100 IU/mL
(>100,000 mIU/mL) a hook effect may be seen. The sponsor included the following
warning in their package insert:
“When hCG is equal to or greater than 100 IU/mL it may present negative result
because of hook effect”.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Wondfo One Step HCG Urine/Serum Test is traceable to the WHO 3rd
International Standard.
d. Detection limit:
The sensitivity of the device was tested by spiking 60 negative urine and 60 negative
serum samples (from non-pregnant females or males) with varying concentrations
(12.5, 18.75, 25, 50, 100 mIU/mL) of hCG. Results are summarized below (units =
mIU/mL).
