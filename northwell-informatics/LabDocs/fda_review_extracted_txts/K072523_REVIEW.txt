and Reagent 2 2X50ml bottles and 2X1ml calibrator materials. In addition, control
materials consisting of three lyophilized human serum based materials are sold
separately. All donor pools for the serum pool used to make the control and calibrator
materials have been tested by FDA licensed methods and found non reactive for
hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C and HIV I and II. The assay is based upon a
2

modified polyvinyl sulfonic acid and polyethylene-glycol-methyl ether coupled
precipitation to LDL, VLDL and chylomicrons making them inaccessible to
cholesterol oxidase and cholesterol esterase. HDL then reacts with cholesterol
oxidase and cholesterol esterase. Addition of special detergents in the R2 reagent
release LDL which reacts with H O which is then quantified by the Trinder

Reaction.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the Diazyme HDL- Cholesterol Reagent was evaluated using the
CLSI EP5-A guideline. In the study three levels of serum samples were tested
with 2 runs per day in duplicate over 20 days using the Roche Diagnostics
Hitachi 917. An additional precision study was performed on the Hitachi 917
using one level of serum containing about 70 mg/dL of LDL-C tested in two
runs per day in duplicate for 5 working days. The results are presented in the
table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity determination was based upon NCCLS (CLSI) EP6-A. 16 samples
were prepared by diluting a serum sample containing 250 mg/dL of LDL-C.
Each level was measured in triplicate on the Hitachi 917. The resulting
regression equation was: Y=0.9848X-1.89, r2=0.9989. The sponsor
determined an acceptable % error was ≤ 10%. The reportable range for the
assay is 2 – 250 mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device has not been certified or tested by the Cholesterol Reference
Method Laboratory Network (CRLMN). A statement reflecting this is
included in the labeling.
The NIST SRM 1915b material was tested with the Diazyme LDL-
Cholesterol reagent and found to have a deviation from the NIST target value
of 2.8% for level I (116.39 mg/dL) and 0.95% for level II (154.05 mg/dL).
Values are assigned to the control materials by repeat testing on the Hitachi
917 using the Diazyme LDL-cholesterol reagent and calibrator. The assigned
ranges are lot specific. The following ranges were obtained for a tested lot:
Level I 142-214 mg/dL; Level II 94-140 mg/dL and Level III 26-38 mg/dL.
Reagent Stability: Reagents from two lots were stored in incubators at 37oC,
25oC and 4oC. Reagents were tested at 0 day, 2 days, 6 days, 7 days and 10
days. Accelerated study results show that the reagent is stable for up to 12
months when stored at 2-8oC. Real time studies are being conducted and
adjustments to shelf life will be made as needed. Stability on board the Hitachi
917 was studied by storing the two reagents (R1 and R2) in the 2-8oC storage
chamber of the Hitachi 917. Results indicate the reagents are suitable for on
board storage for up to 60 days.
Calibrator Stability: Calibrators from two lots were stored in incubators at
37oC, 25oC and 4oC. The calibrators were removed from storage a
predetermined times and tested with the Diazyme LDL-Cholesterol reagent.
The accuracy of the Calibrators was determined by testing LDL-C samples of
know concentrations determined by the predicate kit. The shelf life of the
calibrators was determined to be 12 months at 2-8oC. Real time studies are
being conducted and adjustments to shelf life will be made as needed.
Control Stability: Controls from two lots were stored in incubators at 37oC,

25oC and 4oC. The controls were removed from storage at predetermined
times and tested in duplicate with the Diazyme LDL-Cholesterol reagent. The
accuracy of the controls was determined by testing LDL-C samples of know
concentrations determined by the predicate kit. The shelf life of the calibrators
was determined to be 12 months at 2-8oC. Open vial stability for controls was
determined to be one month. Real time studies are being conducted and
adjustments to shelf life will be made as needed.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LOB) and Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) for the Diazyme
LDL-Cholesterol assay were determined based upon the CLSI EP17-A
Protocol. The LOB was determined by testing zero calibrator 12 times on the
Hitachi 917. The LOB obtained was 1.64 mg/dL (the mean + 3SD). The
Limit of Quantitation of the Diazyme LDL-Cholesterol Reagent was
determined by diluting a serum sample into 4 other samples. The 5 samples
were tested 5 times over 3 days for a total of 125 replicates. The value
estimated for LOQ where a 20% CV was obtained was 2.0 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
To determine the level of interference from substance normally present in
human serum, the Diazyme LDL-Cholesterol Assay was tested with normal
serum samples containing about 79 mg/dL LDL-C spiked with various
concentrations of interfering substances following CLSI guideline EP7-A. The
following substance normally present in serum produced less than 10%
deviation when tested at levels equal to the following concentrations:
Interference Substance Concentration
Ascorbic Acid 10mM/L
Bilirubin 40 mg/dL
Bilirubin Conjugated 40 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 1000 mg/dL
Triglycerides 1000 mg/dL
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 82 samples were compared with the Equal LDL Ultra Cholesterol
and calibrator on the Hitachi 917. Samples were tested based upon

recommendations in NCCLS (CLSI) EP-9A2 guidance. The following
regression equation was obtained: Y = 0.9776X+17.291, r2 = 0.9821.
b. Matrix comparison:
29 samples were compared between serum and EDTA and citrate plasma on
the Hitachi 917. Samples were compared across the measuring range; some
samples were spiked or diluted to cover the entire range.
Serum vs EDTA plasma Y = 1.0642x+1.6446, r2 = 0.9510, N=29
Serum vs Citrate plasma Y = 1.0573x+4.7913, r2 = 0.9768, N=29
