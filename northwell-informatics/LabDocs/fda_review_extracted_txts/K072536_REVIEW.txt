L. Test Principle:
The ESA method is a kit for measurement of total 25(OH) Vitamin D by HPLC
with electrochemical (EC) detection. Specific reagents and solid phase extraction
columns are included for sample preparation. A 200 uL volume of sample (serum
or plasma) is mixed with a precipitation reagent, which contains internal standard.
The internal standard is a stable vitamin D analog that is used to correct for
variability in extraction recovery and analytical sample volume. After
centrifugation, supernatant is poured onto a pre-conditioned SPE column for rapid
extraction of 25(OH)D and the IS. SPE columns are washed with 2 different
reagents and analytes are eluted with a third reagent. The resulting eluent is
diluted before analysis. The prepared sample is analyzed with an ESA HPLC
system using an ESA EC detector (Coulochem III or CoulArray) equipped with a
dual coulometric EC cell. Calibration is accomplished by direct HPLC analysis
of authentic standard solutions (i.e. not taken through the extraction step).
25(OH)D and IS are separated chromatographically followed by EC detection. A
dual EC cell is used with the first, upstream, cell maintained at a specific potential
to oxidatively screen possible interfering sample components. The second,
downstream cell is maintained at a potential that is optimized for selective
25(OH)D detection. Total 24(OH)D sample concentrations are determined by
single-point internal standard quantitation.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed using CLSI Document EP5-A as a
guideline. Five replicates of three concentration levels of analyte in EDTA
plasma pools that were individually prepared and analyzed in a single run
each day, repeated over 20 days. Five days were performed at an external
site. Three different HPLC-EC systems, four operators, two reagent lots, five
analytical columns (3 lots), three lots of SPE columns and four analytical cells
were used in these studies. Three samples were prepared by spiking EDTA
plasma, pooled from 5 individual blood bank donors, with assayed,
commercially procured 25(OH)D.

Two serum and two EDTA plasma samples were acquired from adult human
subjects. Four replicates of each sample were individually prepared (taken
through all pre-analytical and analytical steps of the procedure) and analyzed
in a single run each day, repeated over 20 days. Samples were run on a single
instrument, by two operators and using two lots of reagents and extraction
columns. Three replicates were lost during pre-analytical sample processing.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To establish the linearity of the assay, a study design was used based on CLSI
protocol EP6-A: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement
Procedures: a Statistical Approach: Approved Guideline. The claimed
measuring range of this device is 7 - 200 ng/mL.
A volume of low level EDTA plasma was spiked with assayed 25(OH)D
concentrate. The low and high level samples were mixed to obtain 13 samples
with concentrations spanning the measuring range. Three aliquots of each
sample concentration were taken through the pre-analytical step for the assay.
Upon completion of this step, extracts were divided into 2 aliquots and one
aliquot was analyzed by an HPLC-Coulochem III system and the other was
analyzed by an HPLC-CoulArray system.
Linear regression statistics:

Calibrator:
Value assignment: An Internal Standard Stock and Master Product Calibrator
Stock are created in-house (there is no primary calibrator, recognized
reference material or reference measurement procedure for this Measurand at
this time). Value assignment of both Stocks is made by UV absorbance
spectrometry calibrated with NIST SRM 935a, based on NIST recommended
molar extinction coefficients. A working Internal Standard is created by ten-
fold volumetric dilution of the Internal Standard Stock. The working
Calibrator is a mixture of equivalent volumes of the Master Product
Calibration Stock and Internal Standard Stock, followed by dilution to 100
ng/mL of 25(OH)D. Each lot of product calibrator and internal standard are
assayed by HPLC to confirm purity and between-lot consistency.
Stability:
Kit components: The shelf-life, on-board and open stability testing protocols
for kit components and the acceptance criteria were described and found to be
acceptable. Current shelf life studies support a six-month shelf life, with real-
time studies on-going to support twelve months.
Samples: To evaluate the stability of samples stored at different conditions,
two sample levels were prepared by spiking freshly drawn EDTA plasma with
25(OH)D. Three aliquots of each sample were processed immediately and
analyzed within one hour of processing. Results from these aliquots were
used as the basis for comparison to samples that were stored for various time
periods and storage conditions before processing. On board stability of
processed samples was also assessed.

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of the Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of
Quantitation (LoQ) for the ESA Vitamin D HPLC test was determined in
accordance with the CLSI guideline EP17-A: Protocols for Determination of
Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation. One low level sample was
prepared by spiking blank matrix (bovine serum albumin in phosphate
buffered saline) with 25(OH)D. Two additional low samples were prepared
by pooling patient samples. Six replicates of the blank matrix and three
replicates each of the low level samples were analyzed in each run. Each
replicate was taken through all pre-analytical and analytical steps of the assay.
Twelve runs were performed with two analytical systems, 3 EC cells, 3

analytical columns, 2 lots of SPE columns, 2 reagent lots and two operators.
The non-parametric method (CLSI EP17-A) was used to calculate the LoB.
The LoB was calculated to be 2.51 ng/ml and the LoD was calculated to be
5.3 ng/ml. The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was calculated to be 7.0 ng/ml
and was defined as the concentration of the analyte demonstrated imprecision
less than or equal to 20% CV.
e. Analytical specificity:
The ESA Vitamin D HPLC test was evaluated for interference consistent with
CLSI Guideline EP7-A2.
The following substances were added to two EDTA plasma samples (with
25(OH)D levels of 43 ng/mL and 105 ng/mL) and were found not to interfere
with the Vitamin D HPLC test (a bias exceeding 10% is considered
interference):
Substance Test concentration
Triglycerides 1571 mg/dL
Albumin 12.7 g/dL
Bilirubin 60 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 500 ng/dL
Paricalcitrol 100 ng/mL
(vitamin D analog)
Cholesterol, tested at a level of 500 mg/dL, was found to produce a bias of
more than 10%. (The actual bias seen was 10.1%.) In addition,
25(OH)EpiD3, a vitamin metabolite, was found to interfere with the Vitamin
D HPLC test. This compound is found only in infants 0 – 1 year of age. As
noted in the limitations section of the package insert, this assay should
therefore not be used for measurement in samples from patients less than 1
year of age. (The sponsor did not test 25(OH)EpiD2, also found only in
infants 0-1 year of age, which is known to interfere with 25(OH)D assays, but
referred the user to literature in the product insert for further information.)
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The ESA Vitamin D HPLC Test was compared to a reference method using
CLSI Document EP9-A2 as a guideline for the method comparison study.
The Vitamin D HPLC Test was compared to a reference HPLC method using
serum samples from 85 individual patients and fifteen additional samples
prepared by augmenting aliquots of a single serum pool (prepared from
approximately 50 individual patient samples) with varying amounts of
25(OH)D. Results from 95 specimens with analyte values that spanned the

CLSI C28-A2.
Samples from 150 apparently healthy adult human subjects were collected from 3
locations to achieve even North-South geographical distribution within the
latitudes of the contiguous 48 US States. (Specifically, samples were obtained
from 75 individuals living in Massachusetts, 37 in Tennessee and 38 in Texas.)
Inclusion and exclusion of individuals was based on a questionnaire. The
designation of “apparently healthy adult human subjects” was based on the initial
Normal Blood Donor intake questionnaire and by preliminary viral testing.
Individuals taking prescription or over-the-counter vitamin D supplements were
excluded.
