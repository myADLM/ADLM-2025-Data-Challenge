L. Test Principle:
The diaDexus PLAC Test is based on turbidimetric immunoassay technology
utilizing two Lp-PLA specific monoclonal antibodies (2C10 and 4B4) coated to latex
2
microparticles. A set of Lp-PLA calibrators is used to plot a standard curve of
2
absorbance (y-axis) versus Lp-PLA concentration in ng/mL (x-axis) from which the
2
Lp-PLA concentration in the test sample can be determined. Two levels of controls
2
are assayed to monitor performance within the clinical range of the assay. The
concentration of Lp-PLA in each sample and control is interpolated from the
2
standard curve using a spline curve fit with calibration curve fitting software.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The PLAC Test was validated on the Hitachi® 917.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra-assay, inter-assay and total precision was assessed according to CLSI
EP5-A2 with three reagent lots. Two controls (143.9 and 449.5 ng/mL) and
one serum (68.5 ng/mL) sample were run in duplicates in 2 separate runs on
the Hitachi 917 analyzer for 20 days. The results shown below met the
sponsors acceptance criteria (intra-assay precision CV <8% and total precision
CV <10%).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The recovery of reportable range was assessed according to CLSI EP6-A.
Two high Lp-PA2 serum samples were mixed with low samples to product 11
concentrations/data points. The samples were assayed in duplicates with 3
lots on a single analyzer. The five level dilution series was conducted on a low
serum sample. To further assess the lower end of the claimed assay range, the
sponsor conducted an additional linearity study. Native human Lp-PLA2 was
diluted with fetal bovine serum (used as a negative serum source) to the
lowest level of detection. Percent recovery was determined and linear
regression analysis was conducted. Additionally, the zero calibrator was
titrated with an extremely high level of recombinant Lp-PLA2 up to 1500
ng/mL and dilutions were tested to asses the prozone or high dose hook effect.
Three lots of reagents were evaluated over three separate runs on one
analyzer. The results below met the sponsor’s acceptance criterion (percent
recovery between 90 and 110% of the established mean and no hook effect
below 1500 ng/mL). The linear range is defined as 7-500 ng/mL.

PLAC test calibrators and controls. A master calibrator was prepared from
purified primary stock solution of recombinant Lp-PLA2 that was quantitated
by amino acid analysis. A master calibrator was prepared and the value was
assigned using a panel of stored human serum samples that were characterized
by multiple runs with the predicate device. The calibrators are manufactured
to match the absorbance levels of the master calibrator at each calibration
level (0, 50, 100, 250 and 500 ng/mL). Controls are manufactured to a target
value, but assigned the actual value range generated by multiple PLAC test
runs. Quality control acceptance criteria are that the calibrators must
quantitate replicates of the quality control panel serum samples within +/-
10% of the established mean. The formulation used for both the calibrators
and controls has been validated with the predicate device. The sponsor states
a real-time stability of 16 months at 2 to 8° C.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor conducted a Limit of Detection (LOD) and a Limit of
Quantitation (LOQ) study. The detection limit was defined as the lowest
concentration that is significantly different from zero. Calibrator 1 (0 ng/mL)
and Calibrator 2 (20 ng/mL) were assay 20 times with three reagent lots in the
same run. The mean of the zero calibrator plus 2 standard deviations was
calculated as 4.5, 5.1 and 4.0 ng/mL. The limit of quantitation was defined as
the lowest analyte concentration where the % CV of precision is less than
20%. The 50 ng/mL calibrator was titrated down to zero with calibrator
diluent in a series of 10 incremental levels. Each sample was assayed in
replicates of 3 in 10 runs by three reagent lots on one analyzer. The study was
also performed with a serum sample diluted with bovine serum to 10 levels
ranging from 56 ng/mL down to 8 ng/mL. The limit of quantitation was
estimated to be 7 ng/mL in all three reagent lots using the calibrator series of
samples and 11 ng/mL with the serum samples. The results from the above
studies met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria for LOD and LOQ of less than
20 ng/mL. The sponsor’s limit of quantitation is estimated to be 7.0 ng/mL
and limit of detection is 4.0 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Five endogenous substances (hemoglobin, triglycerides, total cholesterol,
bilirubin and human serum albumin) found in blood and exogenous
substances (common and prescription drugs in the package insert) were
evaluated for interference in the assay. Potential interfering substances were
spiked with the interferent into four different serum samples with endogenous
Lp-PLA in the range of 160 to 470 ng/mL range. Defined amounts of the
2
interferents at and exceeding a relevant physiological range were added to the
serum samples, assayed in duplicate with three lots of reagents, and any
resultant biases in analyte quantitation were reported. The highest levels were
chosen according to CLSI Protocol EP7-A recommended high testing levels.
Controls were prepared for each sample by spiking with the solvent used for
7

--- Page 8 ---
each substance stock solution. Controls were matched to test samples for both
volume and solvent concentration. Recoveries of test samples were calculated
as result/matched control value x 100%. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion
was less than 10% error in detected Lp-PLA2 in the presence of the
compound. There was no interference detected for any of the substances
listed below.
