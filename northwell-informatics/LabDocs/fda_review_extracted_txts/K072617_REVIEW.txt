H. Intended Use:
1. Intended Use(s):
The Elecsys Rubella IgG immunoassay is for the in vitro quantitative
determination of IgG antibodies to rubella virus in human serum and Li-heparin,
K3-EDTA and sodium citrate plasma. This assay may be used as an aid in the

assessment of immune status to rubella in individuals including women of
childbearing age. The electrochemi-luminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” is
intended for use on Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.
PreciControl Rubella IgG: Elecsys PreciControl Rubella IgG is used for quality
control of the Elecsys Rubella IgG immunoassay on the Elecsys and cobas e
immunoassay analyzers.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Instrument comparison: A total of 390 samples were tested on both the Elecsys
2010 analyzer and the MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 analyzer. Samples had
anti-Rubella IgG values ranging from 0 - 500 IU/mL. The positive agreement
was 197/197 or 100% (95% CI: 98.14% - 100% ). The negative agreement was
192/ 193 or 99.5% (95% CI 97.15% - 99.99% )
I. Device Description:
Samples are incubated with biotinylated monoclonal anti-human IgG antibody, RLP
(Rubella-like particles) and a ruthenylated monoclonal anti-Rubella antibody fragment.
In addition a biotinylated Rubella virus-specific recombinant antigen E1 (E. coli) and E1
labeled with ruthenium complexTris(2,2’-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II)-complex react with
anti-Rubella IgG from the sample to form a sandwich complex. A second incubation is
performed with the addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles. The reaction mixture
is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured
onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then removed with ProCell.
Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission which
is measured by a photomultiplier. Results are determined via a calibration curve which is
instrument-specifically generated by 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via
the reagent barcode.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was determined at three different sites using Elecsys reagents,
human sera, and controls in a modified protocol of the CLSI EP5-A document: 6
times daily for 10 days (n = 60). Total precision varied from 2-13% for positive
samples. The following results were obtained:

*The equivocal result, which could not be repeated due to insufficient quantity, was counted as a discrepant
against the Elecsys
Pregnant women study: Serum samples were collected from 150 pregnant women
in the US and tested on the Elecsys and the reference assay. The Elecsys Rubella
IgG showed 100 % agreement (95% CI: 97.57- 100%), with 150/150 positive tests.
Vaccination follow-up: Commercially available vaccination follow-up panels
comprising 152 samples from 13 subjects were also tested. The final specimen
from each panel yielded 100 % agreement (95% CI: 75.29% -100%) between the
methods, with 13/13 positive test results.
Evaluation of low positive samples: 84 serum samples that gave low positive
results (10-20 IU/mL) on the reference assay were tested with Elecsys Rubella IgG
assay. The positive agreement was 80/84 or 95.2 % (95 % CI: 88.25-98.69 %).
Evaluation of CDC reference panel: A panel of 100 serum specimens was
obtained through the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and
tested for Rubella IgG on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer. The sera panel consists of 100
specimens, 50 pairs of sera titered by HI. There are 9 negative sera resulting in 18
negative specimens and 41 positive sera resulting in 82 positive specimens. As
evaluated by the CDC, the Elecsys 2010 analyzer showed 100% agreement, with
82/82 positive tests on 82 positive sera and 18/18 negative tests on 18 negative sera.
CDC Standard: The low titer (21.0 IU/mL) anti-rubella human reference serum
from CDC was tested neat and diluted 1:2 as described in the CLSI document
I/LA6-A. The mean result of the neat standard was 38.8 IU/mL. The mean result
of the two fold diluted standard was 15.4 IU/mL.
