using the Diagnostic Wizard. Results are for the presumptive identification of Y.
pestis in conjunction with culture and other laboratory tests. The definitive
identification of Y. pestis from colony growth, liquid blood culture growth, or from
blood or sputum specimens requires additional testing and confirmation procedures in
consultation with public health or other authorities for whom reports are required.
The diagnosis of plague must be made based on history, signs, symptoms, exposure
likelihood, and other laboratory evidence in addition to the identification of Y. pestis
from cultures or directly from whole blood or sputum specimens.
The JBAIDS Plague Detection Kit is intended for use by trained clinical
laboratory personnel who have received specific training on the use of the
JBAIDS Plague Detection Kit. The level of Y. pestis that would be present in
blood or sputum from individuals with early systemic infection is unknown.
Due to the difficulty in obtaining clinical specimens, these assays were not
evaluated with blood or sputum from individuals with septic or pneumonic
plague.

3) Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable.
I. Device Description:
The JBAIDS Plague Detection Kit is an integrated in vitro diagnostic (IVD) system
composed of the JBAIDS instrument with a laptop computer, software and two different
freeze-dried sets of reagents( Target 1 and 2 assays in one kit) for performing real-time
PCR in glass capillaries. The Kit contains two real-time PCR assays.
Real-time PCR is accomplished with the use of a hydrolysis probe, which detects a
specific sequence within the region amplified by the assay primers. The probe is
labeled on one end with a fluorescent reporter molecule (6-FAM) and on the other end
with a quencher (TAMRA). When the probe is intact, the quencher absorbs the light
emitted by the reporter molecule. During PCR, the intact probe hybridizes to the
amplicon, and the exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase separates the fluorophore
from the quencher, generating a fluorescent signal that is detected by the instrument.
The fluorescent signal increases as additional template is amplified and more probe is
hydrolyzed. The primers and probes were selected based upon two basic criteria: 1)
they detect all sequenced virulent isolates of Y. pestis; and 2) they do not detect
sequences in other organisms.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
The JBAIDS Plague Detection Kit is the first-of-kind, there are no legally marketed
predicate device. At the FDA’s Microbiology Devices Advisory Panel on Mar. 7, 2002
the panel determined that these devices would be Class II and could be compared to
preamendment DFA devices.

L. Test Principle:
The JBAIDS Plague Detection Kit is a real-time PCR with hydrolysis probes to detect Y.
pestis DNA in patient whole blood and sputum samples as well as positive blood cultures
and colonies. After extracting DNA from the specimens, real-time PCR is performed into
the capillaries. The real-time PCR is accomplished with the use of hydrolysis probe that
detects a specific sequence within the region amplified by the assay primers. The probe
is labeled on one end with a fluorescent reporter molecule (6-FAM) and on the other end
with a quencher (TAMRA). When the probe is intact, the quencher absorbs the light
emitted by the reporter molecule. During PCR, the intact probe hybridizes to the
amplicon, and the exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase separates the fluorophore from
the quencher, generating a fluorescent signal that is detected by the instrument. The
fluorescent signal increases as additional template is amplified and more probe is
hydrolyzed. Temperature and fluorescence data are displayed in real-time. Each
JBAIDS test is analyzed and assigned a final result by the Detector module of the
JBAIDS software. Possible final results are positive, negative, inhibited, uncertain, or
invalid. To assign a final test result, Detector first analyzes the data from each capillary
independently before analyzing the sample duplicates together. Finally, the software
assigns a final result, or a combined call, based on the results of the sample and all of its
controls.
The characteristics of the amplification curves from the positive control (PC), negative
control (NC), inhibition control (IC), and from each unknown sample are automatically
analyzed by the JBAIDS Software. Results are reported as Positive, Negative, Inhibited,
or Uncertain. When results cannot be determined as positive or negative and are
equivocal, the instrument readout displays ‘Uncertain’. When PCs or NCs are
unacceptable, the test results for all samples in the JBAIDS run are considered invalid
and must be repeated.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility: Reproducibility study was performed at three sites on
three different days. Sample panels were prepared by spiking either whole blood, sputum,
or simulated blood culture specimens with inactivated Y. pestis at low (near LOD),

medium, or high level. Negative sample panels were not spiked for each matrix. Overall
reproducibility for all three matrices ranges from 94 – 98 % except sputum for target 2
(84.9 %). This data is acceptable for devices of this type. See table below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Positive, Negative and Inhibition controls were included in each run and gave
expected results. If not, the runs failed or were called invalid and the run needed
to be repeated.
d. Detection limit:
Initially, the Limit of detection (LOD) was estimated by spiking whole blood or
sputum specimens with a serial dilution of live Y. pestis CO92. Whole blood
specimens collected in 3.2% sodium citrate were spiked with 6 to 100 CFU/mL of
live Y. pestis. Sputum specimens were spiked with 330 to 1000 CFU/mL. Each
specimen was purified using the appropriate sample purification kit, IT 1-2-3
QFLOWdna for whole blood and IT 1-2-3 VIBE for sputum specimens and the
purified samples were tested with the Y. pestis assay following standard
procedures. Based on the titration results, the LOD was estimated to be 50
CFU/mL for whole blood and 670 CFU/mL for sputum. Reactions were
evaluated using the JBAIDS test result, the Cp, and a visual examination of the
amplification curves.
To confirm these LOD levels, 59 whole blood specimens were spiked with 50
CFU/mL and 59 sputum specimens were spiked with 670 CFU/mL live Y. pestis

CO92. The specimens were processed and tested, and the frequency of positive
results was determined. All 59 spiked whole blood specimens were successfully
detected by the JBAIDS Plague Detection Kit, indicating that whole blood
specimens containing organism concentrations as low as 50 CFU/mL can be
detected with 100% success (95% CI, 95%-100%). For sputum, all 59 specimens
were detected with the Target 1 and 56 (94.9%) were detected with the Target 2
assay, indicating that sputum specimens containing Y. pestis at 670 CFU/mL can
be detected with 100% success (95% CI, 95%-100%) using the Target 1 assay and
with 94.9% success (95% CI, 87-100%) with the Target II assay.
e. Analytical specificity:
The analytic inclusivity and exclusivity of the JBAIDS Plague Detection Kit was
assessed by testing panels of well-characterized organisms. The panels were
comprised of: (1) Strains of Y. pestis representing the known genetic and
geographic distribution of the organism, (2) Closely related organisms, and (3)
Unrelated organisms typically found in clinical specimens. Y. pestis strains were
tested using colonies grown on culture plates as well as with purified DNA at a
level equivalent to five times the established nucleic acid LOD of the reference
strain, Y. pestis CO92. All non-Y. pestis organisms were tested using only
colonies grown on culture plates.
For all colonies evaluated, the final test result was compared to the expected test
result based on microbiological identification methods, and the Cp value for
positive samples was evaluated. Organisms in the inclusivity panel were expected
to test positive and have Cp values around 20, while organisms in the exclusivity
panel were expected to test negative. For the inclusivity panel using purified
DNA samples, the test result and Cp value for each sample were evaluated. The
LOD for each Y. pestis strain was considered equivalent to the reference strain, Y.
pestis CO92, if the test result was positive and the average Cp value for the strain
was within 1.5 cycles of the average Cp value obtained for the reference strain.
Inclusivity strains: When testing colonies, all 22 strains of Y. pestis were correctly
identified by the JBAIDS Plague Detection Kit. Seventeen of the 22 strains gave
positive test results with both the target assays. Three of the strains gave positive
results with the Target 1 assay and negative results with the Target 2 assay. Two
of the strains gave negative results with the Target 1 assay. The average Cp values
obtained for the different strains ranged from 15.45 to 19.33 for the Target 1 assay
and 16.11 to 20.11 for the Target 2 assay.
Exclusivity strains: All 24 panel organisms gave the expected negative result with
the Target 1 assay, and 23 gave negative results with the Target 2. One strain of
Y. enterocolitica gave a weak cross reaction when testing with the Target 2 assay.
However, the Cp values obtained with this strain were 15 to 20 cycles later than
for the reference strain, demonstrating that the cross-reactivity with the Target 2
assay was very weak.
Interfering Substances: The two JBAIDS assays were tested against a panel of
potentially interfering substances that could be found in whole blood, sputum,
6

--- Page 7 ---
blood cultures, or colonies and could be introduced during sample purification or
reaction set-up. See table below.
The concentration of each substance tested represented a relevant concentration in
accordance with CLSI EP7-A Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry
Approved Guideline.
All endogenous and exogenous substances typically found in whole blood,
sputum, blood cultures, or colonies were spiked into the sample matrix and
subjected to sample processing with the appropriate IT 1-2-3 Sample Purification
Kit prior to testing with the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit. The sample
purification portion of the system is designed to isolate DNA and remove other
impurities; therefore, sample processing should eliminate most potentially
interfering substances from the purified sample. Because technique-specific
substances can be encountered during reaction setup, all such substances were
added to the purified samples immediately prior to reaction setup.
Each sample was tested using an Inhibition Control vial and an Unknown vial.
The substance was considered to be an interfering substance if the target assay
was called negative or inhibited by the JBAIDS Software. A substance was
considered to be potentially inhibitory if the Cp of the target assay or the IC assay
was delayed by more than three cycles or if the Fmax of either assay was
decreased by more than 50% compared to samples with no substance added.

f. Assay cut-off: A data analysis module within assay-specific software applies
mathematical modeling of expected amplification curve shapes to each individual
capillary. When fixed thresholds with a quadratic formula or crossing point determination
are matched, samples are called negative or positive. For undecided samples, an expert
system approach is applied that uses filters to assess the fluorescence change around the
crossing point.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:
The studies were done in sputum, whole blood, cultured isolates and from positive
blood culture bottles. Studies showed that there were differences in blood and
sputum specimens.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity: This assay was not evaluated with blood or sputum
from individuals presenting with signs and symptoms of plague and who
subsequently developed septic or pneumonic plague. Users are instructed to
establish the clinical sensitivity of this test on prospectively collected clinical
specimens.
b. Clinical specificity: A multicenter clinical study was conducted over a 7-
month period on 169 patients exhibiting symptoms consistent with systemic Y.
pestis infection. Patients were selected from those who were hospitalized,
exhibited the clinical definition of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome,
and had a blood and/or sputum culture ordered. The study subjects ranged in age
from 18–94 years (mean 43), and 50.6% were male. Blood samples from 149
subjects were collected and tested, while 45 sputum samples were collected and
tested. For 25 subjects, both blood and sputum specimens were tested.
The study was conducted at three clinical sites in Maryland, California, and
Egypt. The clinical specificity of the JBAIDS Plague Detection System was
assessed by comparing the JBAIDS results (Positive/Negative) to the results
9

--- Page 10 ---
obtained by established culture and microbiology follow-up methods. The results
are summarized in Table 7.
Seventeen of the whole blood results and 9 of the sputum results were removed
from the study, because either a culture was not performed (3 whole blood and 6
sputum specimens), the extraction control failed (10 whole blood and 2 sputum
specimens), or the sample was not tested (4 whole blood and 1 sputum
specimens). As a result of this study, the extraction control procedure was
modified.
Using the standard testing protocol, all 132 whole blood and 36 sputum samples
gave the expected negative result with the Plague Target 1 assay; however, 2
samples gave false positive results with the Plague Target 2 assay. All culture
results were negative for Y. pestis. Therefore, the clinical specificity of the
JBAIDS Plague Detection Kit when testing whole blood specimens is at least
97% (97–100% with 95% confidence) for the Target 1 assay and 95% (95-100%
with 95% confidence) for the Target 2 assay. The clinical specificity when
testing sputum specimens is at least 92% (92–100% with 95% confidence).

1. Modes of Operation:
All sample testing is managed by the software embedded Diagnostic Wizard; up
to 32 capillaries can be loaded into one carousel for a run.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Specimen information is a pre-defined protocol that guides a user through
entering sample information, loading the JBAIDS carousel, and starting the
testing sequence. Data, result call displays and generation of final reports is
managed through the traceable database using the Diagnostic Wizard. Capillaries
are identified by their position number in the carousel.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Blood specimens must be collected in tubes with sodium citrate anticoagulant.
Other anticoagulants are not indicated and may contribute to unreliable results.
DNA is initially extracted and purified from whole blood specimens using the
Idaho Technology IT 1-2-3 FLOW Sample Purification Kit (or validated
TM
equivalent), and from blood culture and direct culture samples using the Idaho
Technology IT 1-2-3 SWIPE Sample Purification Kit (or validated
TM
equivalent). Purified samples must be diluted prior to adding to reagent vials.
5. Calibration:
The fluorimeter is factory-calibrated. Internal self-check procedures are run with
each startup. Cycling temperatures are monitored continuously during a run. The
internal control and positive control must meet specific criteria for a successful
run.
6. Quality Control:
Negative Control: The Negative Control (NC) is used to detect contamination
from target-specific amplicon, genomic DNA {as found in the Positive Control
(PC) vials}, or organism. One NC (resulting in two capillaries) must be included
for each assay in a test run. Both of the NC capillaries must be Negative, or the
JBAIDS software will assign Invalid results to all of the associated samples, and
the run must be repeated. Frequent or repeated failures of NCs may indicate
significant contamination of the work area.
Positive Control: The PC serves as an amplification and detection control. One
PC (resulting in two capillaries) must be included for each assay in a test run.
Both of the PC capillaries must be Positive and have Cp results that are earlier
12

--- Page 13 ---
than the assay’s specific cutoff value. If either capillary fails, the JBAIDS
software will assign Invalid results to all of the associated samples, and the run
must be repeated. Failure of the PCs may indicate errors in sample setup,
degradation of the reagents, or a malfunction of the JBAIDS instrument. If the
Inhibition Control (IC) capillaries in the same test run are Positive, then the
failure is most likely caused by an isolated error with the setup of the PC. If the IC
capillaries are also negative, possible causes for failure are 1) a systematic error in
sample setup, 2) degradation of the reagents, or 3) a malfunction of the JBAIDS
instrument.
Inhibition Control: The IC is used to demonstrate that the purified sample does not
interfere with, or inhibit, the PCR reaction. Each purified sample is tested using an
Unknown vial and IC vial (for a total of four capillaries). If either of the IC
amplification curves demonstrates inhibition and the target assay is negative, then
the result for that sample will be Inhibited. The IC amplification curves are called
Inhibited by the JBAIDS software if 1) the Cp value for the IC exceeds the assay
specific cutoff value or 2) if the shape of the amplification curve demonstrates
reduced PCR efficiency, as evidenced by a flattening of the amplification curve.
DNA Extraction Control: Well characterized strains of Y. pestis and non Y. pestis
may be used as external NCs and PCs according to guidelines or requirements of
local, state, and/or federal regulations or accrediting organizations. However, due to
safety and regulatory requirements related to the distribution of Y. pestis and other
select agents, this is not feasible in most user settings. To address the lack of
appropriate control materials, Idaho Technology has developed a DNA Extraction
Control Kit that can be used to ensure the proper functioning of the sample
purification kits and procedures. The DNA Extraction Control kit is designed to
work with all of Idaho Technology’s 1-2-3 Sample Purification Kits and can be
used for both environmental and diagnostic applications. This kit can also be used
for training or for verification of user technique.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Carryover and Cross Contamination: Potential carryover was assessed in two ways
for whole blood and sputum: a) Carryover during sample purification independent of
reaction set-up - Positive and negative samples were purified in an alternating pattern,
and the PCR reactions for positive and negative samples were then set up separately;
b) Carryover during reaction set up independent of sample purification – Purified
positive samples were used to set up reactions alternately with water (true negative).
Sample sets consisting of seven negative samples and seven positive samples were
processed using the appropriate IT 1-2-3 sample purification kit and tested using both
assays of the JBAIDS Plague Detection Kit. Positive samples were spiked with
inactivated Y. pestis at approximately 5 x 106 CFU/mL. For each matrix evaluated,
three different operators tested independent samples sets for a total of 21 positive and
13

--- Page 14 ---
21 negative samples. For blood culture specimens, only one evaluation was done.
Positive and negative samples were alternately purified before being used to
alternately set up positive and negative reaction.
For whole blood specimens, all 21 negative samples gave negative results with both
the Target 1 and Target 2 assays. For the 21 negative sputum specimens, one sample
gave a false positive result with the Target 1 assay but was negative for the Target 2
assay. Another sample gave uncertain results for both assays, and a third sample gave
a negative result with the Target 1 assay and an uncertain result with the Target 2
assay. For blood culture samples, one sample gave an uncertain result with the Target
1 assay while all 21 were negative with the Target 2 assay.
Comparison of all data showed that the Y. pestis Target 1 assay is more likely to
detect sample purification carryover than the Y. pestis Target 2 assay.
Sample Transport and Storage
The evaluations were performed using simulated samples prepared by spiking live
Y. pestis into whole blood and sputum specimens. For the assessment of colonies
and blood-culture specimens, a panel of Y. pestis and non- Y. pestis isolates was
used for the positive and negative samples, respectively.
