Chemistry (75)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use.
2. Indication(s) for use:
IRISpec™ CA/CB/CC is an assayed QC material for monitoring of the urine
chemistry analytes and devices as listed on the package insert. For in vitro
diagnostic (IVD) use only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Not applicable
4. Special instrument requirements:
iChem 100®, Aution AX-4280®, Aution AJ-4270®
I. Device Description:
IRISpec™ CA/CB/CC controls are based on a synthetic matrix simulating human
urine with preservatives. Bovine-sourced biological material is added for serum
albumin, hemoglobin, and bilirubin. L-ascorbic acid is in the CC control material
only. It does not contain human sourced materials.
IRISpec™ CA/CB/CC will be marketed as a set. IRISpec™ CC is not intended to
be marketed as a stand-alone product.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
IRISpec™ Urine Chemistry Control CA and CB
Note: The predicate device, IRISpec™ CA and CB, has been re-labeled as
IRISpec™ CA/CB.
2. Predicate K number(s):
k945913

L. Test Principle:
Not applicable
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Ascorbic acid was added gravimetrically to the control material to obtain a
positive result of approximately 40 mg/dL. Values were confirmed with
repeat testing on each instrument.
Comparison testing was performed on three lots of the proposed CC control
material and compared to human urine spiked with ascorbic acid at 40 mg/dL.
Testing was performed in triplicate on the iChem 100 Urine Analyzer. No
measurement differences were found.
Real time, open vial, and accelerated stability protocols were reviewed and
found to be acceptable. The material has a 6 month shelf life.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Not applicable
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
