I. Device Description:
The ADVIA™ Chemistry C-Reactive Protein_2 assay consists of two liquid, ready-to-

turbidity is measured at 571 nm. The CRP concentration in serum or plasma is
determined from a calibration curve that is generated with the CRP_2 calibrators.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run and total precision were evaluated by testing three serum pools
and 3 control levels on the ADVIA 1650. Samples were evaluated in
duplicate in 2 runs per day for 10 days. Precision was evaluated using
calculation methods in CLSI EP-5A2. Acceptance criteria (described below)
were met.
Within-run Total

SD CV(%) SD CV(%)
Control 1 31 0.33 1.1 0.38 1.3
Control 2 56 0.51 0.9 0.61 1.1

The acceptance criteria for precision performance are as follows:
Acceptance Criteria
C-RP concentration

Lower range (~10 5% 8%

Upper range 12%
≤ 10%
Additionally, CRP_2 Control recoveries on each platform must be within ±
5% of the ADVIA 1650.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated by making equally spaced dilutions of a high serum
pool with a low serum pool and comparing the expected vs. observed CRP
concentration. Difference in recovery was ≤ 3.5%. Linear regression
statistics demonstrated that the slope (and 95% CI) was 1.01 (0.987 to 1.034),
y-intercept -0.10 (-4.35 to 4.14); r= 1.0.

The ADVIA Chemistry system has an ‘auto-dilution’ option to extend the
measuring range above CRP concentrations of 304 mg/L (highest level
calibrator). Samples above this are automatically diluted 3-fold by the
system. The extended linearity of the ADVIA 1650 assay was evaluated by
making equally spaced dilutions of two serum pools and comparing expected
vs. observed CRP concentrations. Difference in recovery was ≤ 8.3%. Linear
regression statistics for the entire assay range (0 to 1071 mg/L) demonstrated
that the slope (and 95% CI) was 1.033 (1.001 to 1.064), intercept was 2.04
(-12.85 to 16.94), r=0.999.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceable to CRM-470.
Data and testing methodology were provided to support the open and closed
stability claims in the labeling. Closed stability: 18 months at 2-8oC; On-
board stability 60 days. Calibrator stability 60 days 2-8oC.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of detection (LoD) was obtained using the mean and SD of a blank
and a low sample containing CRP (~3mg/L); and computed according to
CLSI EP-17A protocol and determined to be 0.2 mg/L, n=40. The data
support the low end claim for the analytical range as 4 mg/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference was evaluated by spiking human serum pools with hemoglobin
(max 1000 mg/dL), unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin (max 60mg/dL),
Intralipid and avian triglycerides (max 1000 mg/dL), and rheumatoid factor
(200 IU/mL). Multiple levels up to the maximum concentration listed of each
of the interfering substances were tested at CRP concentration of ~5 mg/L.
Interference was also tested on samples containing 10 mg/L CRP using a
single concentration of interferent (highest evaluated). All results passed the
acceptance criteria for interference of ≤ 10%.
Prozone: No hook effect demonstrated up to 1000mg/L of CRP.

A matrix comparison study was performed using matched serum and lithium-
heparin plasma samples spanning the range of the assay. The results
demonstrated equivalence between the matrices. Least square regression
