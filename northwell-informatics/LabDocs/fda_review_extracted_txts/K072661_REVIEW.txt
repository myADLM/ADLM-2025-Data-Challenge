This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own Class
II, devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device. UniCAP
Thyroglobulin (k981559) and UniCAP Thyroid Peroxidase (k981930)
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in
its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED (page 4) along with the proposed labeling which includes
instructions for use, package labeling.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including clearly labeled diagrams, engineering
drawings, photographs, user’s and/or service manuals in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the
FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.
The change involves the following:
• Change of product name from UniCAP to ImmunoCAP
• Change sample diluent which contains a blocking agent that binds unspecific binding
antibodies
• Option to use ImmunoCAP 100 as well as ImmunoCAP 250
4. Comparison Information (similarities and differences) to applicant’s legally marketed predicate
device included the following:

A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the
device and its components, and the results of the analysis. The risk analysis method used to
assess the impact of the device modification was Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA)
procedure (Pages 1-8)
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities required,
including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied (see attachment).
c) A declaration of conformity with design controls. The declaration of conformity should include:
i) A statement signed by the individual responsible, that, as required by the risk analysis, all
verification and validation activities were performed by the designated individual(s) and the
results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance criteria were met (page 38 ) and
ii) A statement signed by the individual responsible, that the manufacturing facility is in
conformance with design control procedure requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and
the records are available for review (page 38).
5. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary and the Indications for Use Enclosure.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use
for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular
modifications and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices
demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the
design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the
device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
