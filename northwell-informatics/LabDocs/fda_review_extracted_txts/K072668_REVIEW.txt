2. Indication(s) for use:
This submission is for the addition of a new formulation of the antibiotic
vancomycin at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 gtg/mL to VITEK® Gram
Positive (AST-GP) panels. Vitek 2® Gram Positive Vancomycin is designed
for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus
spp., and Streptococcus agalactiae. VITEK 2® Gram Positive Vancomycin is
a quantitative test. It is intended for use with the VITEK 2® and VITEK 2®
Compact Systems as a laboratory aid in the determination of in vitro
susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.
3. Special condition for use statement(s):
The VITEK 2 AST cards cannot be used with direct clinical specimens or
other sources containing mixed flora. Any change or modification in the
procedure may affect the results.
Prescription Use Only
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Not Applicable
1. Device Description:
Each VITEK® 2 test card contains 64 microwells. A control well, that contains
only microbiological culture medium is resident on all cards, with the remaining
wells containing pre measured amounts of a specific antibiotic combined with
culture medium. A suspension of organism from a pure culture is made in 0.45-
0.5% sterile saline in a clear plastic polystyrene tube and standardized to a
McFarland 0.5 standard using the DensiChek Turbidity meter. The desired card(s)
are placed in the cassette along with an empty tube for the susceptibility card. The
cassette is placed into the VITEK® 2 instrument where a susceptibility test will be
automatically diluted from the ID suspension by the Vitek® 2. Alternately, a
manual dilution specific for each AST product type card can be made. The cards
are then automatically vacuum filled; the tubes are cut and the cards sealed prior to
proceeding to the Incubator Loading Station. Cards are then transferred from the
cassette into the carousel for incubation (35.5 C) and optical scanning during
testing. Readings are performed every 15 minutes.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA"; CLSI M7 (M 100-S 16)
"Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow
Aerobically; Approved Standard"
L. Test Principle:
Optics systems use visible light to directly measure organism growth. These
transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before
significant growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same
well measure organism growth by how much light is prevented from going
through the well. An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours with the
majority of the S. pneumoniae between 5 and 9 hours. The VITEK Susceptibility
Card test is based on the microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
technique with concentrations equivalent to standard method concentrations.
Several parameters based on the growth characteristics observed are used to
provide appropriate input for the MIC calculations. Discriminate analysis is used
to develop the algorithm that determines the susceptibility result for all
antimicrobials on the VITEK 2 system. The MIC result must be linked to an
organism identification in order to determine a category interpretation. A
category interpretation will be reported along with a MIC.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
An external evaluation was conducted with fresh and stock clinical isolates and
challenge strains. The external evaluations were designed to confirm the
acceptability of the new formula of VITEK 2 Gram Positive Vancomycin, using both
the auto-dilution and the manual dilution methods, by comparing its performance
with the CLSI broth microdilution reference method read at 24 hours.
This submission is for the AST Panel only. The ID System was not reviewed.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using a panel of 10 Staphylococcus
aureus isolates in triplicate, each for three days at three sites with
VITEK 2 AST-GP Vancomycin (VA2), for a total of 270 results.
All results were > 95 % reproducible for both dilutions methods.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability( controls, calibrators, or method):
The recommended QC isolates were tested by VITEK 2 AST cards
containing Vancomycin, and broth microdilution plates containing
Vancomycin. QC organisms Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29212 and
EnterococcusfaecalisA TCC 29213 were tested at each clinical trial site.
One Streptococcusp neumoniae ATCC 49619 quality control organism
was tested throughout comparative testing with Streptococcus agalactiae
by the reference method only (data not presented). This was done to
perform further quality control of the broth microdilution panels
supplemented with lysed horse blood. The VITEK 2 was tested a
sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the system can produce
QC results in the recommended range > 95% of the time. The
following tables provide the frequency of the results in each
concentration at each of the 3 testing sites for the manual and the auto-
dilution (automated) dilution methods.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical testing was conducted at 3 sites. The new formulation
and new algorithm testing included 963 clinical isolates of which
280 were fresh, along with a challenge set with known results.
Two methods of inoculation (manual and automated) were
evaluated by both VITEK 2 AST-GP Vancomycin and broth
microdilution containing Vancomycin. All isolates with
the exception of 2 completed incubation in the VITEK 2 AST-GP
card in <16 hours. A panel of 105 organisms were used for
Challenge testing at one site. Each challenge organism was tested
one time by manual dilution, automatic dilution, and broth
microdilution, and the Disk Approximation Test (data not
presented). A comparison was provided to the reference method
with the following agreement.

The performance characteristics of the antimicrobial agents included
in VITEK 2 AST cards were established using the manual and
automated modes at multiple clinical laboratories. The VITEK 2
AST card results were compared to results from a reference method
prepared according to CLSI. Essential Agreement (EA) represents
VITEK 2 results which agree exactly with the Reference method or
are within a +/- one two-fold dilution of the reference result.
Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the VITEK 2 and the
reference interpretative result agree as Susceptible, Intermediate, and
Resistant (S-I-R) exactly.
There were 4 minor (min) discrepancies generated by the in the
Challenge set using the automated dilution method, and there were 5
min and 1 major discrepancy (maj) produced using the
manual dilution method. The EA% and the CA% for both dilution
methods were both very good.
Clinical testing and challenge testing using the automated
method demonstrated no very major discrepancies (vmj) and no
major discrepancies. A combined EA % of 99.8 and CA % of 99.6
are both very good.
The test device had a growth rate of >95%.
