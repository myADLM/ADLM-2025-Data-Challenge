L. Test Principle:
In the AxSYM HbA1c assay, a whole blood sample is lysed, releasing hemoglobin
and HbA1c. Hemoglobin and HbA1c analyte are captured on a glass fiber matrix by
a binding reaction that occurs between the analyte and a Blocking Buffer. HbA1c is
quantified by measuring the amount of HbA1c analyte captured on the matrix cell,
using a conjugate of Anti-HbA1c and Alkaline Phosphatase as the signal-generating
molecule, and the substrate, 4-Methylumbelliferyl Phosphate (MUP).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was determined following the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) Protocol EP5-A2. Two lots of AxSYM HbA1c reagents and
one lot of kit calibrators and kit controls were used throughout the study. The
low kit control, high kit control, and two whole blood samples were assayed
in replicates of two, twice daily, for 20 days (n=80). There were at least 2
hours between each run on each of two AxSYM instruments. A calibration
curve was generated on each instrument during Run 1 on Day 1 for each
reagent lot. Controls and samples were run as samples every day after that.
Fresh AxSYM HbA1c kit controls and samples were used for each run.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linear range was evaluated using 5 high HbA1c whole blood sample pools
that were diluted with 5 separate low HbA1c whole blood sample pools. The
linear range was also evaluated using whole blood Calibrator F diluted with
whole blood Calibrator A. The dilutions were made as recommended in the
CLSI guideline EP6-A and an analysis was carried out in accordance with the
guideline by performing 1st, 2nd and 3rd order least squares regressions. The
results demonstrated linearity for all datasets. In addition, the observed values
were within ± 10% of the expected values for all samples tested. The results
submitted demonstrated linearity across the claimed measuring range of 4.0%
to 14.5% HbA1c.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The AxSYM HbA1c Standard Calibrators are prepared from glycated
hemoglobin human whole blood diluted in non-glycated hemoglobin human
whole blood and are traceable to the International Federation of Clinical
Chemistry (IFCC) reference calibrators. The AxSYM HbA1c assay is certified
with the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP)/DCCT.
The AxSYM HbA1c kit controls are prepared from glycated hemoglobin
human whole blood diluted in non-glycated hemoglobin human whole blood
and values are assigned with the IFCC reference calibrators.

Reference Calibrator values are assigned from the IFCC reference calibrators
by performing a minimum of one run on each of five AxSYM instruments
over three days. The same procedure is performed using the reference
calibrators to assign values to the kit calibrators.
Control values are assigned from the IFCC reference calibrators following the
same instrument protocol as the calibrators.
Calibrators and controls are claimed to be stable until the expiration date
printed on the label when stored at -20°C. Unopened vial stability testing was
performed at the intended storage temperature of -20°C and results supported
the expiration dating printed on the label. In use stability was performed with
vials that were stored at -20°C, then opened and closed properly and stored at
2°-8°C. Results of this testing support the stability claims of 30 days after
opening when the vials are closed properly and stored at 2°-8°C.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 4 to 14.5% HbA1c (see linearity section above).
e. Analytical specificity:
Studies for interfering substances, rheumatoid factor, protein (gamma
globulins), acetylsalicylate, sodium cyanate, ascorbic acid, urea, bilirubin and
triglyceride were carried out according to CLSI document EP7-2A. For these
studies, low and high % HbA1c fluoride oxalate whole blood sample pools
representing the normal and diabetic ranges were spiked with the interfering
substance. Unspiked samples for each interfering substance were also
prepared from the same low and high % HbA1c sample pools by adding an
equal volume of the buffer that was used to prepare the interfering substance
stock solutions in place of the interfering substance. The spiked and unspiked
samples were tested in the AxSYM HbA1c assay in replicates of 10.
Interference was defined as a difference greater than 0.75% HbA1c between
samples with and without interferant. The following concentrations were
tested and did not demonstrate any interference.

Acetylsalicylate 50 mg/dL

A hemoglobin concentration interference study was carried out using
International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) reference controls
containing different levels of Hemoglobin (7, 14 and 21 g/dL), but the same
level of %HbA1c. These were tested in the AxSYM HbA1c assay and the %
Interference and % HbA1c difference were calculated. Interference was
defined as a difference greater than 0.75% HbA1c between samples with and
without interferant. The concentrations tested did not demonstrate any
interference with hemoglobin concentrations form 7 to 21 g/dL.
A pre-glycated hemoglobin study was carried out using 3 whole blood
samples in the normal and diabetic range. The samples were treated with high
concentrations of glucose (1400 mg/dL for 3 hours at 37o C), producing labile
HbA1c spiked samples. Unspiked samples were prepared in the same
manner, but were treated with an equal volume of diluent used to prepare the
glucose stock solution in place of the 1400 mg/dL glucose stock solution. The
spiked and unspiked samples were tested in the AxSYM HbA1c and the %
Interference and % HbA1c difference were calculated. Interference was
defined as a difference greater than 0.75% HbA1c between samples with and
without interferant. The concentrations tested did not demonstrate any
interference.
A hemoglobin (Hb) variant interference study was carried out using samples
provided by the IFCC known to contain Hemoglobin variants C, D, E, F, J,
and S. These were tested in the AxSYM HbA1c assay and the %HbA1c
difference and % difference between the mean concentration obtained for each
sample and the corresponding % HbA1c reference value provided by the
IFCC was determined. The hemoglobin variants C, S, J and F each had
differences within ± 0.75 of the IFCC supplied value. Therefore hemoglobin
variants C, S, J and F did not interfere in the AxSYM HbA1c assay. The
hemoglobin variants D and E had differences greater than ± 0.75 of the IFCC
supplied value. Therefore hemoglobin variants D and E do interfere in the
AxSYM HbA1c assay. A statement to this affect has been inserted in the
Reagent Package Insert under the ‘Limitations of the Procedure’ section.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Correlation studies based on guidance the CLSI protocol EP9-A2 were
performed to compare the AxSYM HbA1c assay with the Tosoh G7
Automated HPLC-HbA1c Variant Analysis device. 300 whole blood patient
samples ranging in concentration from 4.4% to 14.5% HbA1c were tested
with both devices. Passing-Bablok regression was performed and calculated
a slope of 1.02 and a y-intercept of -0.35 with a Pearson correlation r value of
0.96.
b. Matrix comparison:
In order to compare anticoagulant collection tubes, ten patient samples were
collected in fluoride oxalate, fluoride EDTA and potassium EDTA whole
blood collection tubes. The potassium EDTA samples were subjected to one
freeze thaw cycle and thawed prior to testing to minimize settling of red blood
cells. All samples were tested neat and then tested again following spiking
with HbAlc at three levels to cover the concentration range of the AxSYM
HbAlc assay as determined by AxSYM analysis (4.9 to 14.3% HbAlc). With
the exception of two spiked samples, the fluoride EDTA and potassium EDTA
results were within ±1% HbA1c compared to the fluoride oxalate tubes. The
two samples that exceeded ±1% had results of 10.3 in fluoride oxalate and 8.9
in potassium EDTA and 14.3 in fluoride oxalate and 13.1 in fluoride EDTA.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Depending on the assay used, HbAlc is approximately 4% to 6% in nondiabetics,
6% to 8% in controlled diabetics, and can be as much as 20% in uncontrolled
diabetics.3,16, 17 Diabetic patients with HbAlc levels below 7% meet the
therapeutic goal of the American Diabetes Association.18 In a representative
study, fluoride oxalate whole blood samples from 100 apparently healthy donors
were tested using the AxSYM HbAlc assay. The median AxSYM value was 5.1%
HbAlc. Using non-parametric analysis, the central 95% of the population was 4.6
to 6.0% HbAlc. It is recommended that each laboratory establish its own
reference range, which may be unique to the population it serves depending upon
geographical, patient, dietary or environmental factors.
