2. Indication(s) for use:
This submission is for the addition of the antibiotic tigecycline at
concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 µg/ml to VITEK® 2 Gram Positive (AST-
GP) panels. It is intended for use with the VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2
Compact Systems as a laboratory aid in the determination of in vitro
susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. VITEK® 2 Gram Positive Tigecycline
has been shown to be active in vitro against Enterococcus faecalis
(vancomycin-susceptible), Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin – susceptible
and –resistant isolates), and Streptococcus agalactiae; and against
Enterococcus faecium (vancomycin-susceptible and - resistant isolates),
Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Enterococcus
casseliflavus, but the clinical significance is unknown.
3. Special condition for use statement(s):
a. The VITEK 2 AST cards cannot be used with direct clinical specimens or
other sources containing mixed flora. Any change or modification in the
procedure may affect the results.
b. The ability of Tigecycline to detect resistance with Enterococcus faecalis
(vancomycin-susceptible), Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin –
susceptible and – resistant isolates), and Streptococcus agalactiae is
unknown because these strains have not yet been detected and should be
restested. If a “non-susceptible” result is obtained the strain should be
submitted to reference laboratory for further testing.
c. Prescription Use Only
4. Special instrument Requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
Each VITEK® 2 test card contains 64 microwells. A control well, that contains only
microbiological culture medium is resident on all cards, with the remaining wells
containing pre-measured amounts of a specific antibiotic combined with culture
medium. A suspension of organism is made in 0.45-0.5% sterile saline from a pure
culture in a clear plastic polystyrene tube and standardized to a McFarland 0.5
standard using the DensiChek Turbidity meter. The desired card (s) are placed in the
cassette along with an empty tube for the preparation of a bacterial suspension. The
cassette is placed into the VITEK® 2 instrument where a susceptibility test will be
automatically diluted from the ID suspension by the Vitek® 2. Alternately, a manual
dilution specific for each AST product type card can be made. The cards are then
automatically vacuum filled; the tubes are cut and the cards sealed prior to proceeding
to the Incubator Loading Station. Cards are then transferred from the cassette into the
carousel for incubation (35.5o C) and optical scanning during testing. Readings are
performed every 15 minutes.

Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria that Grow Aerobically – Seventh Edition.
L. Test Principle:
Optics systems use visible light to directly measure organism growth. These
transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant
growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure
organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through the well. An
interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours with the majority of the S.

pneumoniae between 5 and nine hours. The VITEK Susceptibility Card test is based
on the microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) technique with
concentrations equivalent to standard method concentrations. Several parameters
based on the growth characteristics observed are used to provide appropriate input for
the MIC calculations. Discriminate analysis is used to develop the algorithm that
determines the susceptibility result for all antimicrobials on the VITEK 2 system.
The MIC result must be linked to an organism identification in order to determine a
category interpretation. A category interpretation will be reported along with a MIC.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
An external evaluation was conducted with fresh and stock clinical isolates and
challenge strains. The external evaluations were designed to confirm the
acceptability of VITEK® 2 Gram Positive Tigecycline, using both the auto-dilution
and the manual dilution methods, by comparing its performance with the CLSI broth
microdilution reference method read at 24 hours.
This submission is for the AST Panel only. The ID System was not reviewed.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using a panel of 10 Staphylococcus
aureus isolates in triplicate, each for three days at three sites with
VITEK® 2 AST-GP13 Tigecycline, for a total of 270 results. The
reproducibility did not include Enterococcus spp. isolates. There were a
total of 12 off-scale results in the auto-dilution and in the manual
dilution methods, respectively. The mode for the off-scale results was
more susceptible than the on-scale results mode by greater than two
dilutions. On-scale results were > 95 % reproducible for both dilutions
methods.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
The recommended QC isolates were tested by VITEK 2 GP13
containing Tigecycline, and broth microdilution plates containing
Tigecycline. QC organisms Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and
Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 were tested at each clinical trial site.
One Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 quality control organism
was tested throughout comparative testing with Streptococcus agalactiae
by the reference method only (data not presented). This was done to
perform further quality control of the broth microdilution panels
supplemented with lysed horse blood. The VITEK 2 GP13 card was
tested a sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the system can
produce QC results in the recommended range > 95% of the time. The
following tables provide the frequency of the results in each

E. faecalis ATCC 29212 QC performance: The modes for the VITEK 2
GP13 results were one dilution more resistant than the modes of the
reference methods for both dilution methods. Two results, in the VITEK2-
GP13 (TGC), (2/73, 2.7%), were interpreted outside the expected QC
result range of 0.03-012 µg/mL. However, overall QC results were within
the expected range ≥95% of the time for both dilution methods, which is
acceptable.
S. aureus ATCC 29213 QC performance: The modes for the VITEK 2-
GP13 results were the same as the reference methods for both dilution
methods. Two results, in the Vitek GP13 (TGC), (2/90, 2.2%), were
interpreted outside the expected QC result range of 0.03-025 µg/mL.
However, overall QC results were within the expected range ≥95% of the
time for both dilution methods, which is acceptable.
No QC trending was observed.
Inoculum density control: A turbidity meter was used (DensiCheck) for
the turbidity inoculation method. DensiChek Calibration verification

results. Two methods of inoculation (manual and automated) were
evaluated by both VITEK 2 AST-GP13 Tigecycline and broth
microdilution dilution containing Tigecycline. All isolates with the
exception of one completed incubation in the VITEK 2 AST-GP13
card in <16 hours. A panel of 105 organisms were used for
Challenge testing at one site. Each challenge organism was tested
one time by manual dilution, automatic dilution, and broth
microdilution, and the Disk Approximation Test (data not
presented). A comparison was provided to the reference method
with the following agreement.

The performance characteristics of the antimicrobial agents included
in VITEK 2 GP13 cards were established using the manual and
automated modes at multiple clinical laboratories. The VITEK 2
AST GP 13 card results were compared to results from a reference
method prepared according to CLSI. Essential Agreement (EA) was
calculated for clinical trial data. However, the VITEK 2 AST-GP13
Tigecycline claims are for Category Agreement (CA) only. A
statement to that effect is included on the VITEK 2 AST-GP13
Tigecycline package insert. Category Agreement (CA), in this case,
occurs when the VITEK 2 GP13 and the reference interpretative
result agree as Susceptible or Non-susceptible.
The Clinical testing and Challenge testing using the automated
method in the categorical agreement data demonstrated 2 very major
discrepancies (vmj) and 3 major discrepancies (maj). There was
only 1 major discrepancy (maj) in the Challenge set using the
automated dilution method and no discrepancies produced using the
manual dilution method as shown in the tables above. Additional
data was provided focusing on the Vancomycin resistant
Enterococcus spp., since their performance in Tigecycline, has

Enterococcus faecalis ≤ 0.25 * Not applicable * Not applicable
(Vancomycin-susceptible isolates only)
Staphylococcus aureus ≤ 0.5 * Not applicable * Not applicable
* The current absence of resistant isolates precludes defining any results other than “Susceptible”. Isolates yielding MIC results suggestive
of “Nonsusceptible” category should be submitted to reference laboratory for further testing.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The expected value range, interpretive criteria and QC for Tigecycline (TGC) are the
same as recommended by FDA. Additionally, the most current in vivo and in vitro
organisms shown to be active with Tigecycline are also included in the package insert
along with their appropriate interpretative limitations.
* The current absence of resistant isolates precludes defining any results other than
“Susceptible”. Isolates yielding MIC results suggestive of “Nonsusceptible” category
should be submitted to reference laboratory for further testing.
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and support
a substantial equivalence decision.
