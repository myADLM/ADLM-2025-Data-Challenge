H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indication(s) for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The BILI CAL is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of the Direct
Bilirubin (DBIL) and Total Bilirubin (TBIL) methods on the Dimension Vista®
System.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:

I. Device Description:
The BILI calibrator is a two level calibrator material. Level 1 calibrator is purified
system water, which is provided on-board the Dimension Vista® and contains no
bilirubin. Level 2 is a liquid, bovine serum albumin based material spiked with
ditaurobilirubin and traceable to NIST Standard Reference material 916a.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The calibrator is traceable to NIST SRM 916a. The values are assigned by
spiking master serum pools with varying amount of ditaurobilirubin and
analyzing repeated measurements on the instrument calibrated with NIST
material. Then the working bovine serum calibrator material is prepared by
spiking with ditaurobilirubin and analyzing repeated measurements for total
and direct bilirubin on the instrument calibrated with the master pools.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 35 plasma samples and 32 serum samples were assayed on the
instrument in duplicate to compare the results of the proposed calibrator
material on the y axis with the current calibrator material on the x axis. The
results yielded the following linear regression equations:
