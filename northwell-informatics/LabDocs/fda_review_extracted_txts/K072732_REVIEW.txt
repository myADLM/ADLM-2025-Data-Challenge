H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
ORTHO T. cruzi ELISA Test System is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the
in vitro qualitative detection of antibodies (Immunoglobulin G) to Trypanosoma cruzi (T.
cruzi) in human adult serum (glass, plastic, or serum separator tubes) and plasma (EDTA,
lithium heparin or citrate) using whole-cell lysate antigens. Reactive assay results are
presumptive evidence of past infection, and in conjunction with other serological and
clinical information, may be used for the laboratory diagnosis of individuals with
Chagas’ disease.
Definitive diagnosis of an acute phase of infection (including acute congenital infection)
must be made by alternate methods, e.g., hemoculture, blood smear.

I. Device Description:
The assay procedure is a three-stage test carried out in a microwell coated with lysate
(antigens) prepared from T. cruzi. In the first stage, test specimen, Negative Control, and
Positive Calibrator are diluted directly in the test well containing Specimen Diluent, and
incubated for a specified length of time. If antibodies to T. cruzi are present, antigen-
antibody complexes will form on the microwell surface. If antibodies to T. cruzi are
absent, complexes will not form. Unbound antibodies in the sample will be removed
during the subsequent wash step.
In the second stage, murine monoclonal antibody conjugated with Horseradish
Peroxidase (Conjugate) is added to the test well. The Conjugate binds specifically to the
antibody portion of the antigen-antibody complex. If complexes are not present, the
unbound Conjugate is removed by the subsequent wash step.
In the third stage, an enzyme detection system composed of o-phenylenediamine (OPD)
and hydrogen peroxide is added to the test well. If bound Conjugate is present, the OPD
will be oxidized, resulting in a colored end product. Sulfuric acid is then added to stop the
reaction. The color intensity depends on the amount of bound Conjugate and, therefore, is
a function of the concentration of antibodies to T. cruzi present in the specimen. The
intensity of color in the substrate solution is then determined with a microwell reader
(spectrophotometer) designed to measure light absorbance in a microwell.

1. Analytical performance: NA
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The intra-assay (within plate) and inter-assay (between plates) precision of the
ORTHO T. cruzi ELISA Test System was evaluated using an eight-member precision
panel. The precision panel consisted of three moderate to strongly reactive samples,
three reactive samples near the assay cutoff (approximately 1.5 – 2.0 S/C), and two
nonreactive samples. The panel was tested at three external sites using three different
kit lots by the semi-automated processing method. Ten replicates each of the eight-
member panel were assayed on a single occasion per day on nine different days by
two technologists for a total of 4319 observations (one observation for R7 was a
statistical outlier). Mean signal to cutoff (S/C), standard deviation (SD), and
coefficient of variation (CV %) results are presented in the table below.

Among the 100 subjects with Leishmania infection, 21 (21.0%) were nonreactive and 79 (79.0%)
were repeatedly reactive. The specimens were obtained in India where T. cruzi is not endemic and,
therefore, the most probable T. cruzi antibody status of the 100 Leishmania specimens is negative.

no Leishmania infection.
Of the 516 non-Leishmania specimens, 511 (99.0%) were nonreactive and five (1.0%) were
repeatedly reactive. Three of the five repeatedly reactive specimens (1 syphilis, and 2 malaria, P.

Clinical Performance
A multi-center study was conducted to establish the clinical performance of the ORTHO
T. cruzi ELISA Test System among individuals at high or low risk for T. cruzi infection
selected under well-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria but without regard to a
known or previously determined T. cruzi antibody assay result. Statistical testing was
performed to ensure that the distribution of ORTHO T. cruzi ELISA S/C values was
homogeneous across the two testing sites participating in the study (Camp Hill, PA and
Newark, NJ), and that the test results could be combined for analysis. Individuals
presumed to be T. cruzi antibody positive by parasite detection methods or by serological
methods were evaluated separately.
Specimens from subjects at high risk for T. cruzi infection (N=574) were collected in
Bolivia (28.9%), Colombia (13.1%), Guatemala (23.3%), Mexico (8.7%) and Nicaragua
(26.0%). The population was 44.9% female and 55.1% male, and ranged in age from 18
to 88 years.
Specimens from subjects at low risk for T. cruzi infection but with signs or symptoms
similar to Chagas’ disease (N=300) were collected in the U.S. from Black (7.7%) and
Caucasian (92.3%) subjects. The population was 43.0% female and 57.0% male, and
ranged in age from 21 to 93 years. Specimens from low risk pregnant women (N=200)
were obtained in the U.S. from subjects in their first (21.5%), second (38.5%) or third
(40.0%) trimester.
Comparator testing was performed with a validated T. cruzi IFA. Additional, more
specific supplemental testing was performed with a validated T. cruzi
radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA).

ORTHO T. cruzi ELISA Results and Most Probable T. cruzi Antibody Status among High
Risk and Low Risk Subjects
Because the T. cruzi IFA is a non-reference standard for detection of antibodies to T. cruzi, the
most probable T. cruzi antibody status of the high and low risk study subjects was determined by
ORTHO T. cruzi ELISA Test System, comparator T. cruzi IFA and supplemental T. cruzi RIPA
testing according to a pre-specified testing algorithm. Specimens not tested with RIPA that were
negative with both the ORTHO T. cruzi ELISA and the T. cruzi IFA were assigned a most
probable T. cruzi antibody status of negative. Specimens tested with the RIPA were assigned a
most probable T. cruzi antibody status of positive, negative or indeterminate based on the RIPA
results.
A comparison of the ORTHO T. cruzi ELISA results to most probable T. cruzi antibody status is
presented in the following table.

Performance with Presumed T. cruzi Antibody Positive Populations
Specimens Positive for T. cruzi by Parasite Detection Methods
The sensitivity of the ORTHO T. cruzi ELISA Test System was evaluated among subjects
classified as parasite positive by historical identification of T. cruzi parasites (N=106). The
samples were obtained from the endemic countries of Bolivia (27.3%), Chile (40.6%), Colombia
(28.3%), and Nicaragua (3.8%), and were tested with the ORTHO T. cruzi ELISA at one testing
site in St. Paul, MN. Specimens in this group were considered to have a most probable T. cruzi
antibody status of positive. Assay sensitivity and 95% exact confidence interval are shown in the
following table.

Specimens Presumed Positive for Antibodies to T. cruzi by Serological Methods
ORTHO T. cruzi ELISA versus T. cruzi IFA
A total of 810 specimens were included in the T. cruzi serological presumed positive population
based upon two positive serological tests for T. cruzi antibodies in use in the countries of origin
(i.e., ELISA, IFA, hemagglutination, or complement fixation). The comparator T. cruzi IFA was
not used to admit specimens to the study. The specimens were obtained from the endemic
countries of Bolivia (17.8%), Brazil (24.7%), Chile (10.6%), Guatemala (2.2%), Mexico (32.5%)
and Nicaragua (12.2%). ORTHO T. cruzi ELISA testing was performed at two testing sites in
Camp Hill, PA and Newark, NJ. Direct comparison of the ORTHO T. cruzi ELISA with the T.
cruzi IFA is presented in the following table.

ORTHO T. cruzi ELISA versus Most Probable T. cruzi Antibody Status
Because the T. cruzi IFA is a non-reference standard for detection of antibodies to T. cruzi, the
most probable T. cruzi antibody status of the study subjects presumed positive by serologic
methods was determined by ORTHO T. cruzi ELISA Test System, comparator T. cruzi IFA and
supplemental T. cruzi RIPA testing according to a pre-specified testing and interpretation
algorithm. Specimens that were ORTHO T. cruzi ELISA repeatedly reactive and positive with
the T. cruzi IFA were assigned a most probable T. cruzi antibody status of positive and were not
tested with the T. cruzi RIPA. All specimens negative with both assays or with discordant results
between the two assays were tested with the T. cruzi RIPA and assigned a most probable T. cruzi
antibody status based upon the RIPA results. A comparison of ORTHO T. cruzi ELISA results
and most probable T. cruzi antibody status is presented in the following table
