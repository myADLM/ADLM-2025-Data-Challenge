clinical and laboratory assessments in asthma. NIOX MINO should only be
used as directed in the NIOX MINO User Manual and the NIOX MINO Quality
Control Test User Manual, by trained physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists
and laboratory technicians. NIOX MINO cannot be used with infants or by
children approximately under the age of 7, as measurement requires patient
cooperation. NIOX MINO should not be used in critical care, emergency care or
in anaesthesiology.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
NIOX MINO should only be used as directed in the User Manual and by trained
physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists and laboratory technicians. NIOX MINO
cannot be used with infants or by children under the age of 7, as measurement
requires patient cooperation. NIOX MINO should not be used in critical care,
emergency care or in anaesthesiology. Subjects should not smoke in the hour
before measurements, and short- and long-term active and passive smoking
history should be recorded. In addition, subjects should refrain from eating and
drinking for 1 hour before exhaled NO measurement. Alcohol ingestion reduces
FE in patients with asthma and healthy subjects FE . It is prudent, where
NO NO
possible, to perform serial NO measurements in the same period of the day and to
always record the time.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Analytical precision was determined in-house. Certified NO in N calibration
2
gas of 200 ppb was mixed with nitrogen gas in a gas mixer, connected in-line
with the NIOX MINO instrument, to obtain three NO concentration levels
(15, 75, and 200 ppb). Two replicate determinations of each concentration
were made twice a day (more than 2 hours apart) for 20 days. 10 NIOX MINO
sensors, continually mounted in 10 NIOX MINO instruments, respectively,
were used in these tests. All NIOX MINO instruments were tested and stored
at ambient room conditions. The NIOX MINO instruments were continuously
powered during the test period.
Repeatability is an estimate of variation within one test run in one day.
Within-device precision is an estimate of variation between test runs and days.
Both repeatability and within-device precision were calculated for the 10
instruments. The results at 15 ppb are expressed as absolute values in ppb.

--- Page 5 ---
The results at the 75 and 200 ppb levels were expressed as percentage of the
measured NO concentration. The results demonstrate that the repeatability and
within-device precision are within the sponsor’s specification limits: < 3 ppb
of measured NO value < 30 ppb, < 10 % of measured NO value > 30 ppb. The
results are presented in the figure and table below.

Clinical Precision
Reproducibility was assessed in a clinical setting, evaluating the variability
between measurements performed in the same patient by different operators.
Total 62 subjects were assessed. Three operators each took two completed
measurements in the same subject in a point of care setting. The order of the
three operators used was randomized and the subject was to attempt to
perform two completed measurement with each operator; i.e. a total of six
completed FE measurements per subject with the NIOX MINO®, within a
NO
maximum of 18 attempts per subject.
The table below shows the agreement among operators for first NIOX MINO
measurement at six different measurement ranges. The standard deviation was
based on the individual FE values.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using 10 concentration levels within the range 3-330
ppb (3, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300 and 330 ppb), with 3 replicates at
each level. All NIOX MINO systems were scheduled for testing after keeping
them continuously powered up for 0, 6, 12 and 18 months respectively, at
ambient conditions, i.e. at room temperature, between 16°C and 30°C, and a
relative humidity (RH) between 20% and 60% (non-condensing). The mean
NO concentration for each set of replicates was plotted against the nominal
NO concentration and the data subjected to regression analysis, applying
option confidence intervals for slope.
The total regression analysis gave a slope of 1.03 and intercept 2.8.and the
squared correlation coefficient r2 was > 0.998 for all the 20 devices tested.
Results in NIOX MINO at 3 and 5 ppb are displayed as <5 ppb, and results at
300 and 330 ppb are displayed as >300 ppb, and therefore these levels are not
included in the plot. The results show that NIOX MINO® is linear within the
measuring range of 5 – 300 ppb.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The NIOX MINO Sensor is an electrochemical sensor pre-calibrated and pre-
programmed by the manufacturer for a defined number of tests (50, 100 or
300 tests). The instrument is calibrated using certified gas concentrations of
nitric oxide and prompts the user for upcoming exchange prior to sensor
expiration and does not allow for measurements with an expired sensor.
The shelf life is 3.5 years from the manufacturing date of the NIOX MINO
unit or 1500 measurements, whichever comes first. The sensor has a shelf life
of 12 months from the manufacturing date, stored in unopened primary
package.
The sensor expires after 4 months once opened and mounted in NIOX MINO
instrument or after the specified number of measurements. When there is less
than 10% of the number of the measurements left, or less than 2 weeks of use
remaining, a message is shown on the display. The shelf life for NIOX Filter
in unopened primary package is 3 years. NIOX Filter is for single use and
must be replaced for every new patient and measurement occasion.

at 3 and 5 ppb. Three replicate determinations of each concentration were
made at each occasion. 20 NIOX MINO sensors, continually mounted in 20
NIOX MINO instruments, respectively, were used in these tests. The
resulting data at 3 ppb and 5 ppb are presented in the table below.

At the nominal value of 3 ppb, the overall mean measured value was 3.95 ppb
(95%CI 3.79;4.12). At the nominal value of 5 ppb, the overall mean measured
value was 5.50 ppb (95%CI 5.31;5.70).
The manufacturer chose the specification limit for lowest detectable level at 5 ppb.
e. Analytical specificity:
Sensor interference levels were tested in a laboratory setting. The substances
and concentrations tested are summarized in the table below. Substances were
selected based on their oxidizing potential, which could interfere with the
electrochemical signal from NO detection. The concentrations were in the
same range or higher than expected concentration of each substance in
exhaled breath. The interference is calculated in relation to highest NO level
in the measurement range, i.e. 300 ppb. The applicable concentration of each
substance was generated, the gas stream was fed to the sensor by a gas-mixer,
and the sensor signal was measured. All tests were performed at normal
ambient conditions; Temperature between 20 and 24 °C, relative humidity
between 45 and 55%.
Nitrogen Dioxide was the only detected significant interferent. The NIOX
MINO® is designed to use a scrubber to eliminate Nitric Oxide and Nitrogen
Dioxide and also other contaminants from the ambient air.

Interference of exogenous substances
A clinical study was performed to investigate the influence of exogenous
substances (chewing gum, carbonated beverage and mouthwash) on FE
NO
measured with NIOX MINO. The primary endpoint was the difference
between baseline FE and FE measured directly after, one and two hours
NO NO
after exposure to each exogenous substance. Results were obtained from 11
apparently healthy subjects between 20 and 65 years of age
The result showed that there are no statistically detectable changes in the
FE levels from baseline to 0 minutes, 1 or 2 hours assessments for chewing
NO
gum, carbonated beverage and mouth wash. The student’s T-test for the
difference between baseline FE and FE measured one and two hours after
NO NO
exposure to each exogenous substance was calculated. The largest systematic
change was observed for chewing gum, which demonstrated a decrease in the
clinically observed difference with less than one ppb. The results for chewing
gum are presented in the table below.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison between NIOX MINO® and predicated device NIOX®
in FE values using the same subjects was performed. Data from the clinical
NO
study and the published study by Alving et al (Alving, K., C. Janson, and L.
Nordvall, Performance of a new hand-held device for exhaled nitric oxide
measurement in adults and children. Respir Res, 2006. 7: p. 67) were
analyzed. The first reading in NIOX MINO was compared with the mean of
readings in NIOX for each subject. Pooling the data yielded an N of 208
subjects and a regression analysis resulted in an intercept of 0.97 (95% CI -
0.65; 2.59) and a slope of 1.01 (95% CI 0.98; 1.05). The results are presented
in the table below.

A multi-center device randomized open-label prospective single-cohort study
aimed at demonstrating substantial equivalence between NIOX MINO® and
predicate device (NIOX®) when measuring the change of FE that often
NO
occurs after 2 weeks of corticosteroid therapy compared to their baseline
levels was conducted. Symptomatic asthmatic males and females, from 7
years of age performed two valid FE measurements at each visit, with
NO
NIOX MINO and NIOX respectively, with a limit of six exhalation attempts
per subject in each device. The order of the FE measurement on NIOX
NO
MINO versus NIOX was randomized. At every visit and for every patient,
spirometry was performed and asthma symptoms were recorded using Asthma
Control Questionnaire® (ACQ). In total, 156 subjects were included, 105
adults 18 - 70 years old and 51 children 7 - 17 years old. 147 individuals
performed valid measurements on both visits and were evaluated per protocol.

NIOX MINO® and the predicate,NIOX®,showed similar performance in FE
NO
with minor non-significant differences between the types of device used
(37.1% and 35.5% reduction in FE , respectively). The reduction in FE
NO NO
from visit 1 to follow-up visit 2, following corticosteroid treatment was
significant for both devices. The patients’ well-being which was followed with
the validated ACQ (Asthma Control Questionnaire) also showed a significant
improvement in the same range (39.7%) as the improvement of FE values.

Subgroup analysis, gender/sex
A significant difference between males and females for the proportion of
patients within the sponsor’s tolerance limits was observed (see the table
below). This indicates that sex could be a confounder when comparing
measurements with NIOX MINO® and the predicate, NIOX®. As between
men and women, in this study, 92 % of the men and 77% of the women were
within the sponsor’s tolerance limits. For subjects with a FE value below
NO
50 ppb (mean of NIOX and NIOX MINO) the sponsor’s tolerance limit was
defined as ±10 ppb. For subjects with a FE above 50 ppb the sponsor’s
NO
tolerance limit was defined as ±20 %.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected values are provided from the literature. In the labeling the sponsor
states, “Given that physiological and environmental factors can affect FE
NO
levels, in clinical practice, ‘healthy’ FE levels need to be established on an
NO
individual basis. However, most healthy individuals will have NO levels in the
range 5-35 ppb (children slightly lower 5-25 ppb) when measured at 50 mL/s.
(ATS/ERS Recommendations for Standardized Procedures for the Online and
Offline Measurement of Exhaled Lower Respiratory Nitric Oxide and Nasal
Nitric Oxide, 2005. Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2005;171:912-930).”
N. Instrument Name:
NIOX MINO Breath Nitric Oxide Test System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
NIOX MINO System is a hand-held, portable system for the non-invasive, on-
line, quantitative measurement of the fractional nitric oxide (NO) concentration in
expires human breath (FE ) measured in parts per billion (ppb).
NO
The NIOX MINO system is comprised of the NIOX MINO unit with AC/DC
adapter, an electrochemical sensor, disposable patient filter, a QC sensor, a QC
filter, test card for storage of patient data, and an optional printer.
The NIOX MINO system includes a sampling and gas conditioning system and a
man-machine interface (MMI). The user is guided on the built-in touch-screen
display through the breathing maneuver by use of the interactive MMI. The
valves and pumps of the instrument are automatically controlled to handle the
inhaled samples appropriately via the instrument electronics and software
program. Filtering of inhaled air eliminates contamination from ambient NO
levels. A built-in flow control keeps exhalation at 50 ml/s so that it is
standardized for all patients. The NO concentration is detected by an
electrochemical sensor. Results are processed using dedicated software and are
expressed as the NO concentration in parts per billion (ppb).
NIOX MINO utilizes analytical electrochemical sensor. The test procedure starts
with the patient emptying the lungs and then inhaling N)-free air to total lung
capacity (TLC) in order to trigger the 10-second exhalation standard mode,
through the mouthpiece.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this product:
16

--- Page 17 ---
Yes X or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no mechanism to identify the specimen.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The user obtains a breath sample by exhaling into the device.
5. Calibration:
The manufacturer performs the calibration for each NIOX MINO® Sensor. NIOX
MINO Sensor is an electrochemical sensor pre-calibrated and pre-programmed for
a defined number of tests (50, 100 or 300 tests).The user easily exchanges it upon
expiration. The instrument prompts the user for upcoming exchange prior to
sensor expiration and does not allow for measurements with an expired sensor.
6. Quality Control:
NIOX MINO® provides internal controls as well as an External Quality Control
program for the user to verify the reliability of measurements.
The External Quality Control consists of a daily and a weekly control procedure.
When the weekly quality control procedure is not performed successfully, the
instrument’s Lock-Out function is activated and the text “LOCK-OUT” is
displayed. It is not possible to perform any FE measurements in the instrument
NO
when in Lock-Out mode. Once lock-out occurs, the mandatory Weekly Quality
Control procedure must be immediately performed. The instrument cannot be
used until this has been performed successfully.
Daily Quality Control Procedure consists of a biological control test of a human
breath sample:
An exhaled breath sample from one or more qualified staff members is used. The
staff member conducts a standard exhalation test, and the instrument is expected
to display a result that is within the staff members moving average ± 10 ppb,
which average must remain within 10 - 40 ppb. Values should be logged in a log
book. See NIOX MINO® Quality Control Test User Manual.
Weekly Quality Control Procedure is mandatory and prompted for:
• Every time a new instrument is used for the first time.
• Every time a new NIOX MINO® Sensor has been mounted.
• After 45 measurements or 7 days, whichever comes first.
Weekly Quality Control tests consist of three sequentially performed tests, for
details on the procedure; see NIOX MINO Quality Control Test User Manual.
1. The first test is performed using exhaled breath samples from one or more
17

qualified staff members. The staff member conducts a standard exhalation
test, and the instrument is expected to display a result that is within the
staff members moving average ± 10 ppb which average must remain
within 10 - 40 ppb. Values should be logged in a log book. Values are
logged in a log-book.
2. The second test is performed with the NIOX MINO® QC Filter, specially
designed to present a sample which should be free of NO. When the
instrument completes its analysis of this sample, it should present a result
below the detection limit.
3. The third test uses a NIOX MINO® QC Sensor, specially designed to
provide electronic signals to the NIOX MINO, simulating exhaled breath
samples containing Nitric Oxide (NO) of 15 ppb and 75 ppb. These levels
are in the clinical “normal” and the clinical “high” range.
There is also a possibility to manually prompt for this QC sequence, using a
QC Test card.
