L. Test Principle:
Not applicable.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
No information on traceability was provided. The mean values were derived
from replicate analysis. The tests listed in the labeling were performed by the
reagent manufacturer and/or independent laboratories using manufacturer
supported reagents. The sponsor recommends in the labeling that each
laboratory establish its own means and acceptable ranges and use those
provided only as guides.
Stability studies assayed for both microalbumin and creatinine. Accelerated
stability studies were performed to support shelf life of the product. Real time
studies are on-going for the life of the product. The sponsor’s acceptance
criterion is defined as T being ± 10% T .
final zero
Shelf life stability: 2 years at 2 to 8◦ C.
Open vial stability: 30 days at 2 to 8◦ C.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Not applicable.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable.
