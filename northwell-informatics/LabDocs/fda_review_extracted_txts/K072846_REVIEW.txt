c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Expiration dating is established at 105 days (closed vial) and 14 days (open
vial) when stored at 2-8o C and handled according to instructions for use.
Three lots of two levels were tested for open and closed vial testing.
4. Clinical cut-off:
N/A
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The target mean values for manufacturing are initially specified at 3-7 cells/µL
for the WBCs 5-15 cells/µL for the RBCs for level 1, and 180-220 cells/µL for
the WBCs, 10-20 % Mononuclears, 70-90% Polymorphonuclears, ~5%
Monocytes, and 180-220 cells/µL for the RBCs for level 2. Each different
analyzer will have its own protocol to establish ranges.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
a substantial equivalence decision.
