The Triage® Total Controls 5 are assayed materials to be used with the Triage®
Profiler S.O.B.™ Panel, Triage® CardioProfilER® Panel, Triage Cardiac Panel,
Triage® BNP Test, Triage® D-Dimer Test and the Triage Meters to assist in
monitoring test performance.
The Triage® Total Calibration Verification 5 are assayed materials to be used
with the Triage® Profiler S.O.B.™ Panel, Triage CardioProfilER® Panel,
Triage® Cardiac Panel, Triage® BNP Test, Triage® D-Dimer Test and the Triage
Meters to verify the calibration of the Test Devices throughout the measurable

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription Use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Triage MeterPlus® and Triage MeterPro®
I. Device Description:
The Triage® Total Control 5 Controls 1 and 2, and the Triage® Total Calibration
Verification 5 Levels A, B, C, D, E are single-use 0.29 mL unit dose quality control
materials prepared with concentrated purified CK-MB, myoglobin, troponin I, BNP
and D-Dimer and human EDTA plasma at defined levels. The human plasma
material has been tested for hepatitis B surface antigen, antibodies to hepatitis C, and
antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus. The controls are stored frozen at
< -20°C. Preservatives and stabilizers are added to maintain product integrity.
