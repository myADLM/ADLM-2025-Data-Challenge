L. Test Principle:
The AMDL, Inc. DR-70® (FDP) assay is an ELISA based assay utilizing removable
strips in a 96 micro titer plate well format. The wells are coated with affinity purified
rabbit anti-DR-70 polyclonal antibodies. The DR-70 antigen in diluted patient serum
(1:200) is captured by these antibodies immobilized in the well of a micro titer plate.
After a wash step, anti-DR-70 antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
are added to the wells. If the DR-70 antigen is present, the HRP-labeled anti-DR-70
Ab will bind to the captured tumor marker to form an immunological sandwich with
the immobilized antibodies.

After a second wash step, the enzyme substrate TMB is added to the well. The end
point is read in a micro plate reader at 450 nm once the reaction is stopped with 0.1N
HCl. The intensity of the color formed is proportional to the amount of DR-70 in the
serum. The amount is quantified by interpolation from a standard curve using the
calibrators provided with the kit.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Five specimens were tested by 3 sites, 20 days, 3 lots, 2 runs (per day), and
replicate (2 per run) for 720 lines of data per specimen. The five specimens
were Pool 1 (low concentration), Pool 2 (medium concentration), Pool 3 (high
concentration), QC1 (low concentration), and QC2 (high concentration). The
study day is nested within study site and run is nested within day. To obtain
variance components for all variables, each was considered random in the
mixed model.
The highest mean concentration of serum pool for the precision study of 2.8
ng/mL is accepted based on the rationales that majority (>90%) of observed
FDP of colorectal cancer are below 5 ng/mL, and the assay imprecision is
usually lower in the upper assay range.

0.6 µg/mL and a control diluent buffer were spiked with a DR-70 antigen solution
to obtain expected levels ranging from 1.5 µg/mL to 10 µg/mL to represent the
range of the DR-70 calibrators. The values of DR-70 in the spiked serum samples
were measured and compared to the theoretical values and to values obtained for
the control diluent buffer. The experiment was designed to compare responses of
the analyte in a biological sample versus the standard diluent to assess for any
difference in assay response.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range
Linearity
The linearity of a marker over the range of evaluation was analyzed by a
method consistent with NCCLS EP6-A. Two-fold serial dilutions were made
on serum samples from 5 colorectal cancer patients with DR-70 values in the
range of 19.7 to 22.2 μg/mL with assay diluent buffer. For each CRC patient
serum sample, a total of 9 diluted samples were tested. The following table
lists the average % difference between the actual and the estimated DR-70
concentrations for each dilution as well as the average % recovery. The DR-
70® FDP ELISA assay was linear from 1.5- 10 μg /mL with recoveries from
93 to 108%.

Assay reportable range is from 0.063 to 10 μg/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no recognized reference standard for DR 70. Value assignment of the
controls and calibrators was based on gravimetric method.
Stability
The DR-70® (FDP) Kit has an expiration date assignment of up to 18 months
which is based on the component with the shortest dated stability data for the
kit components. Real time stability studies have been conducted on each
production lot of kits consisting from the initial date of QC up to the amount
of months to the assigned kit expiration.
d. Detection limit
Analytical Sensitivity
The minimal detectable concentration (MDC) of DR-70® (FDP) is estimated
to be 0.06 μg/mL. The MDC is defined as that concentration of DR-70®
(FDP) corresponding to the absorbance that is two standard deviations from
the mean rate of absorbance of 20 replicate determinations of a zero
calibrator.
Functional Sensitivity
The functional sensitivity was determined by diluting the lowest non-zero
calibrator serially, measuring the DR-70® (FDP) concentration and
extrapolating to the point where the CV% = 20%. Functional sensitivity for
the AMDL-ELISA DR-70® (FDP) was calculated as being between 0.052 and
0.063 μg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity and interference
Interference was defined, for purpose of this study, to be recovery > 10% of
the known specimen mean concentration. Interferents (hemoglobin, bilirubin,
triglyceride and heparin) were spiked into two patient serum pools with
background man FDP concentrations at 1.07 and 2.2 μg/mL. Results showed
that hemoglobin (up to 500 mg/dl), bilirubin (up to 30 mg/dl), triglyceride (up
to 1000 mg/dl) and heparin (at concentrations of 500 U/ml) do not interfere
with the assay.
In addition, the following pharmaceutical agents were tested at levels
indicated and found not to cause analyte recovery > 10%: 5’-fluorouracil
(Adrucil) 1.0 mg/mL; Acetaminophen 0.2 mg/mL; Adriamycin (Doxorubicin
HCl) 0.10 mg/dL; Coumarin 1.4 mg/mL; Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) 0.25
mg/mL; Paclitaxel, 3.5 x 10-6 g/m2; Amethopterin hydrate (Methotrexate) 4.5
mg/mL; Mitoxanntrone (Novatrone) 0.5 mg/mL; Folinic acid (Leucovorin)
1.10 mg/mL; Mitomycin C, 0.06 mg/mL and Cisplatin, 0.10 mg/mL.
f. Assay cut-off
A 15% increase from the previous visit was chosen as the threshold for
significant % change for the determination of disease progression in the DR-
70® (FDP) immunoassay based on the %total CV from the precision study.
The total %CV was computed over all runs, days, and intra-assay for each
5

--- Page 6 ---
specimen analyzed and the highest CV values were observed for specimens
with low DR 70 concentrations (0.21-0.42 μg/mL). Since over 80% of the DR
70 measurements in the cancer monitoring samples had concentrations ≥ 0.6
μg/mL, the sponsor used the average of the highest %CV obtained for samples
with 1.31 (CV=7.85) and 4.11 (CV=7.14) μg/mL which was equal to 7.495%.
The δ (significant change in marker value) is equal to 1.96 times the %total
CV. Using the value of 7.495%, the threshold for significant change was
estimated to be 14.69% (7.495*1.96) rounded up to 15%. Thus if a later visit
has a value that is greater than 15% higher than the previous value, it will be
considered evidence of disease progression.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable since there is no predicate device.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable, use of serum as specimen only.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Clinical Specificity:
A clinical evaluation was performed to assess the DR 70 (FDP) assay for
monitoring patients with colorectal cancer. Serial samples were taken from
112 colorectal cancer patients resulting in 445 paired observations (335 paired
observations were post baseline samples). The sequential draws covered an
average longitudinal period of at least nine months. The samples were
retrospective banked samples that were collected blindly and without bias to
include all patients with diagnosed colorectal cancer in the bank at the time of
the collection. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the samples were provided.
The breakdown of the patient series is presented in Table 5. The average
number of observations per patient is 4.0.

Data analysis
Clinical disease progression was determined by the Subject’s physician based
on office procedures and clinical laboratory based analyses that were the
standard of care during the time of the monitoring period. Progression of the
DR-70 value was determined as a significant percentage change (15%)
between the current and previous readings
The 335 paired observations from the post baseline sampling were evaluated
in two ways. The initial analysis presents estimates directly from the data.
This analysis is followed by a bootstrap sample for each patient by randomly
sampling one visit from each sample and recording the sensitivity or
specificity for that visit. Note that if there was a progression the sensitivity
would be 1 if the DR-70 increased from the previous visit by 15% or more
and 0 if it did not. If there were no progression at that visit, then there would
be no sensitivity reported at that visit, but the specificity would be reported as
1 if the DR-70® (FDP) value was below a 15% increase for that visit and 0
otherwise. For the per-visit analysis, there were 135 visits for sensitivity and
198 visits for specificity.

A second analysis was done on a per-patient basis in which the number of
progressions across all visits for a given patient was used to compute a patient
level sensitivity by taking the number visits that DR-70 value increased by at
least 15% among the number of visits in which there was a progression.
Similarly, the number of visits at which DR-70 had a lower than 15% increase
divided by the number of visits in which there was a non-progression allowed
the computation of a per-patient specificity. If a patient had all progressions
there would be no specificity for that patient and if a patient had all non-
progressions, there would be no sensitivity for that patient. This resulted in a
sample of 112 patients with at least one sensitivity, specificity, or both. This
resulted in 70 estimates of per-patient sensitivity and 86 estimates of per-
patient specificity.
Results of per-visit analysis
There were 10,000 bootstrap samples of 112 observations taken with
replacement from the 334 paired observations. After each sample was taken,
the following table was formed.

Using alpha = 0.05, the sum of sensitivity and specificity from this analysis
clearly is statistically significantly above 100. The median sum is likely to be
about 133 with the median sensitivity about 65 and the median specificity
about 67. The lower two-sided 5% confidence bound is about 118. The
median PPV and NPV are about 59 and 73, respectively, across the five
samples. Note that these values are consistent with those computed from the
per-visit values given above Table 9. The five repetitions of the sample of
2,000 demonstrate that the result is robust and consistent.
Results of per-patient analysis
For the per-patient analysis, the computed per-visit sensitivity from the 112
per-patient evaluations was 100*45.68/69 = 66.21, the specificity was
100*58.63/86= 68.18, the sum of sensitivity and specificity was 134.39, the

Using alpha = 0.05, the sum of sensitivity and specificity from this analysis is
statistically significantly above 100. The median sum is likely to be about 134
with the median sensitivity about 66 and the median specificity about 68. The
lower two-sided 5% confidence bound for the sum is about 121. The median
PPV and NPV are about 53 and 69, respectively, across the five samples.
Note that these values are consistent with those computed from the per-patient
values given above Table 10. The five repetitions of the sample of 2,000
demonstrate that the result is robust and consistent.
The per-patient bootstrap results by cancer stage
The data are limited with respect to the stage of the cancer, but the analysis
below presents the results of the estimates of sensitivity, specificity, sum,
PPV, and NPV with confidence intervals computed with variances from the
Emir et al (1998) method. The number of patients at each stage was 1 in

Stage 0, 4 in Stage 1, 18 in Stage 2, 39 in Stage 3, and 50 in Stage 4. For the
purposes of this analysis, Stage 0-2 are combined in one analysis, and Stages
3 and 4 are analyzed separately.
The table of sensitivity, specificity, sum, PPV and NPV by cancer stage is
given below. It should be noted that there were only 6 patients with 8
progressions in the Stage 0-2 group so the estimate of sensitivity will have
large variability.
The per-patient bootstrap results by cancer stage are in the following table:

Note that even among the stages with the lowest numbers of patients, the two-
sided 5% lower confidence limit excludes 1 and the test retains its informative
nature for Stage 3 and Stage 4. Predictably, as the prevalence increases across
the stages, PPV increases and NPV decreases.
b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. is not applicable):
4. Clinical cut-off:
For monitoring of disease status, fifteen percent (15%) or greater change from the
previous visit for monitoring of disease progression.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The distribution of DR 70 concentrations determined in 1185 serum samples from
normal subjects and patients with nonmalignant or malignant disease was
evaluated. In this study, 84.5% of the normal subjects had DR-70 levels less than
1.5 µg/mL (Table 12).
