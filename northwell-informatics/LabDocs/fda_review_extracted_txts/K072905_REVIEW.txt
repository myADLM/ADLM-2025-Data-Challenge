b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the device was demonstrated by comparing 20 prepared whole blood
samples on the 3test Supreme and a glucose reference method; each level was tested
on 8 different meters with one lot of test strips. The 20 samples covered the claimed
clinical range of the meter (20 - 600 mg/dL). Analysis of the results showed a linear
relationship between the meter and the reference method: y = 1.0169x – 1.7713, R2 =
0.9976.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The control materials supplied for this device were cleared under k050224.
d. Detection limit:
20 mg/dL: see linearity studies above. For values below 20 mg/dL the meter reads
‘LO” and for values above 600 mg/dL the meter reads “HI”.

e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor tested the following exogenous and endogenous substances, and
anticoagulants for interference using three levels of glucose (80, 160, and 260
mg/dL). The sponsor’s acceptance criteria is a mean glucose difference of ± 15%
between the test sample and control sample (with no interfering substance). For
exogenous and endogenous substances each interfering substance had 4 different
levels of interferant spiked into the three levels of spiked glucose samples. For
anticoagulants, two interferant concentrations were used. Results are summarized
below:

The sponsor evaluated the effect of hematocrit levels 30 – 55% on whole blood
samples spiked to six hematocrit levels for three levels of glucose (75 mg/dL, 155
mg/dL, and 254 mg/dL. The values generated were compared with the glucose values
from a reference method. Based on the sponsor’s acceptability criterion of <±15%
deviation for glucose concentrations versus YSI. The data supports the sponsor’s
claimed range of hematocrit levels between 30-55%.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A consumer study was performed with 150 lay-users and a technician to see if

blood using the instructions in the User’s Guide. A technician then took a fingerstick
reading. Samples ranged from 70 – 343 mg/dL. Based on ISO 15197 “In vitro

3test Supreme Glucose Monitoring System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip contains 3 sections which can be used for 3 different tests. Once a section
is used it is broken off with the provided tool. Once the three sections have been used,
the strip must be replaced with a new strip for further readings.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger only. Since
the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no special handling or
storage issues.
5. Calibration:
A calibration code is provided with each batch of test strips and is entered into the meter
to calibrate the meter for that batch. No further calibrations are required of the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor is providing one of two levels of glucose control solution with this device.
The high level will come with the system and the low level will be available for purchase.
When the C button is pressed after a strip is inserted into the meter, the control mode is
activated. This prevents control results from being stored in the internal memory. An
acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is
referred to the troubleshooting section of the User’s Manual if control results fall outside
these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Not applicable.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
