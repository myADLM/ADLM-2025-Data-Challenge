510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
k072920
B. Purpose for Submission:
Abbreviated submission for the clearance of a modification to the currently cleared
CoaguChek XS Plus
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
ROCHE DIAGNOSTICS CORP.
CoaguChek XS Plus Handheld Base Unit (HBU)
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Prothrombin Time
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Handheld Base Unit is an accessory to the CoaguChek XS Plus PT
instrument that provides the ability to recharge the internal battery of the
CoaguChek XS Plus and facilitates the connectivity of the CoaguChek XS Plus to
an external computer in order to download the device memory.
2. Principles of Operation:
The HBU uses a POCT1-A protocol to identify a docked instrument in order to
trigger the automatic host communication. Connectivity between the HBU and
CoaguChek XS Plus is established either via infrared or IrDA.
3. Modes of Operation:
A switch (USB configuration switch), on the back side of the Handheld Base
Unit, sets the BASE to one of three different modes of operation:
1

--- Page 2 ---
Position Mode Description
1 Ethernet The BASE converts meter communication (IrDA)
received on the BASE’s IR window to wired
Ethernet.
2 Serial & The BASE converts host communication (USB
Ethernet Comm) to serial infrared on the BASE’s IR
window.
-or-
The BASE converts meter communication (IrDA)
received on the BASE’s IR window to wired
Ethernet.
Note: The BASE cannot handle Serial & Ethernet
conversion simultaneously. Both communication
paths will be handled on after the other by means
of timeouts.
3 Configuration The BASE acts as a mass storage device on the
USB port. Writing and reading files, using the
mounted mass storage file system is the way to
communicate with the BASE.
4. Specimen Identification:
N/A
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
N/A
6. Calibration:
N/A
7. Quality Control:
N/A
8. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicants Hazard Analysis and Software Development
