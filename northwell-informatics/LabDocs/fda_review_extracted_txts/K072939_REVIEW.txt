L. Test Principle:
The HE4 EIA is a solid-phase, non-competitive immunoassay based upon the direct
sandwich technique using two mouse monoclonal antibodies, 2H5 and 3D8, directed
against two epitopes on the HE4 molecule. Calibrators, controls and patient samples
are incubated together with biotinylated Anti-HE4 monoclonal antibody (MAb) 2H5
in streptavidin coated microstrips. HE4 present in calibrators or samples is captured
by the biotinylated Anti-HE4 MAb to the streptavidin coated microstrips during the
incubation. The strips are then washed and incubated with enzyme-labeled Anti-HE4
MAb 3D8. After washing, buffered substrate/chromogen reagent (hydrogen peroxide
and 3, 3’, 5, 5’ tetra-methyl-benzidine) is added to each well and the enzyme reaction
is allowed to proceed. During the enzyme reaction a blue color will develop if antigen
is present. The intensity of the color is proportional to the amount of HE4 present in
the samples. The color intensity is determined in a microplate spectrophotometer at
620 nm (or optionally at 405 nm after addition of Stop Solution). Calibration curves
are constructed for each assay by plotting absorbance value versus the concentration
for each calibrator. The HE4 concentrations of patient samples are then read from the
calibration curve. The HE4 EIA Kit measures concentrations between 15 and 900
pM.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three studies at three different sites were performed to assess the precision of
the HE4 EIA Kit. These studies were modeled after NCCLS guideline EP5-
A2 “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement
Methods; Approved Guideline - Second Edition (2004)”. Each site performed
the assay non-consecutively for 20 total days performing 2 runs per day with 4
samples tested as unknowns. The 2 runs per day are separated by a minimum
of 2 hours. The 4 samples and 2 kit controls were tested in 2 replicates using 2
lots of HE4 Kits. One trained technician participated in the study. Samples 2
through 4 are comprised of native HE4 antigen supplemented into normal
human sera. Panel 1 is normal sera only. The total number of replicates was
160 per sample. The individual replicates were evaluated using valid
calibration curves. The kit controls were tested and evaluated for each assay to
determine assay validity. A summary of these results are as follows:

The average total imprecision for the 4 panel members and the 2 kit controls
ranged from 3.3% and 6.5% CV. The HE4 EIA Kit meets the predetermined
acceptance criteria of ≤ 20% total CV and supports the performance claims of
the assay of < 15 % CV.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The assay measures concentrations between 15 and 900 pM. Dilution linearity
within the assay range was evaluated using CLSI guideline EP6-A
“Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A
Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline,” as a guide. Six serum samples
with elevated HE4 values were diluted with 6 serum samples with low HE4
values or with HE4 Calibrator A for 12 combinations. The samples were
tested as unknowns with the assay in 2 replicates for all 12 combinations. Two
kit lots were used in the study. The individual sample replicates were
evaluated using valid calibration curves. The kit controls were tested and
evaluated for each assay to determine assay validity. The mean concentration
obtained from the replicates of each sample for each dilution was compared to
the mean of the expected values. The percent recovery was calculated
according to the CLSI guideline. Similar percent recovery results were
observed using serum as well as diluent buffer as sample diluent. The
recoveries of each sample at the various dilutions (n=60) range from 84.8 to
102.1%, - average recovery 96.7%.
Analysis of the linearity data for the 6 samples using the method described in
the EP6-A guideline indicates linearity for the 6 samples. Comparison of the
slopes of the best fit linear line for each sample across the diluent type (serum
or buffer diluent) indicates no difference in slopes. Similarity of slopes
indicates no significant difference in diluent type.
Accuracy
To assess assay accuracy, HE4 was added to human serum and recovery was
calculated from the measured HE4 concentration in 2 separate determinations.
Five (5) serum samples from apparently normal subjects were supplemented
with 4 different HE4 concentrations (approximately 15 pM, 75 pM, 350 pM,
and 650 pM) and tested along with unspiked samples in duplicate in the assay.
The individual sample replicates were evaluated using a valid calibration

curve. The kit controls were tested and evaluated for each assay to determine
assay validity. The mean concentration obtained from the 2 replicates of each
sample with the added HE4 antigen was compared to the mean value of the
corresponding unspiked sample without added HE4 antigen. The results for
the 5 samples in both studies are as follows:
Normal sample 1 - 5

Mean %Recovery ± SEM 96.2 ± 0.7
The mean recovery from both data sets meets the acceptance criteria of 100 +
15%. The percent recovery is slightly lower at concentrations above 650 pM,
as noted in the lowered mean % recovery in spiked level 4. The difference is
additionally noted in the following graph of observed and expected HE4
concentrations (The line of 100% recovery, or identity of observed and
expected, is the solid black line).

human Fc antibody fragment and gene sequence for HE4. The protein is
produced in a stably transfected cell line and purified from the cell line. The
same recombinant HE4 antigen is used in the assay controls. Assigned values
are arbitrary.
d. Detection limit:
A study was conducted to determine the lowest measurable HE4 concentration
that can be distinguished from zero for the assay. NCCLS (CLSI) guideline,
EP17-A “Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of
Quantitation; Approved Guideline,” was used as a guide to design the
experiment. Two lots of HE4 calibrator B (30 pM concentration) were
separately diluted with zero calibrator (0 pM concentration). Thirty-two (32)
replicates of zero calibrator and the diluted calibrator of each lot were tested
on 2 separate days in 4 assay runs by 2 technicians. The mean and standard
deviation of assay signals were calculated for the samples with no HE4 and
for samples with HE4. The Limit of Detection (LoD) of the assay was
calculated to be in the range of 1.08 pM to 2.36 pM, meeting the
predetermined acceptance criteria of < 15 pM. The 95% confidence interval
for this determination (mean of 4 determination ± 1.96*standard deviation) of
the LoD was 1.1 to 2.2 pM.
A study was conducted to determine the lowest concentration of HE4 at which
the sample CV’s was 20%. NCCLS (CLSI) guideline, EP5-A2 “Evaluation of
Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved
Guideline - Second Edition (2004)”, was used to design the experiment. A 5-
member serum panel was made by serial 2-fold dilution of a normal serum
sample with HE4 Calibrator A (0 pM). The limit of quantitation (LoQ) –
described as functional sensitivity- of the HE4 EIA Kit was determined by
testing each panel in 4 replicates using 2 lots of the assay at 2 separate times
per day for 20 days. Two (2) technicians participated in the study. The order
of the samples was changed for each run (n=160 per sample). The mean of
each panel for each run, each day and an overall mean (total) for all runs was
calculated. The LoQ was defined from the data as the concentration at which
the CV% is less than or equal to 20%. The values determined for the HE4 EIA
Kit were found to be < 5 pM, meeting the predetermined acceptance criteria of
< 25 pM.
A more exact value found by modeling the trendline of %CV vs. HE4
concentration indicates that the LoQ is 3.85 pM with imprecision of 20%CV.
The lowest calibrator target concentration in the assay is 30 pM. The LoQ is
substantially below the lowest calibrator concentration.
e. Analytical specificity:
To evaluate the potential interference in the assay from lipids, bilirubin,
hemoglobin, protein, human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA), rheumatoid
factor (RF), NCCLS (CLSI) guideline, EP7-A “Interference Testing in
Clinical Chemistry, Approved Guideline,” was used to design the interference
experiments. The percent recovery was calculated in each separate
6

--- Page 7 ---
experiment. The acceptance criterion was mean percent recovery of 100 ±
15%.
The percent recoveries for samples with 30 mg/mL (3 g/dL) of supplemented
lipid ranged from 88.8% to 93.6%, average recovery equaling 90.3%. Less
than 15% average interference (i.e., mean recovery of 100 ± 15%) was
observed in the assay with samples containing an elevated level of lipids.
The percent recoveries for samples with 0.2 mg/mL (20 mg/dL) of
supplemented bilirubin ranged from 98.3% to 101.0%, average recovery
equaling 99.8%. Less than 15% average interference was observed in the
assay with samples containing an elevated level of bilirubin.
The percent recoveries for samples with a hemoglobin concentration of 5
mg/mL (500 mg/dL) and 10 mg/mL (1000 mg/dL) ranged from 96.6% to
104.7%, average recovery equaling 99.6%. Less than 15% average
interference was observed in the assay with samples containing an elevated
level of hemoglobin.
The percent recoveries for samples with a total protein concentration of 120
mg/mL (12 g/dL) were 111.1% to 114.1%, average recovery equaling
113.1%. Less than 15% average interference was observed in the assay with
samples containing an elevated level of protein.
To evaluate interference from HAMA, 5 specimens containing HAMA and 2
normal serum samples were each spilt into 3 equal aliquots. To two of the
aliquots, 2 different concentrations of HE4 were added, one HE4
concentration in each aliquot. Samples were tested as unknowns with the
assay, in 4 replicates. Two lots of kit were used in the study. The mean
concentration obtained from the 4 replicates of each test sample was
compared to the mean value of the corresponding control sample for each kit
lot. The range of recoveries for HAMA samples supplemented with a low
HE4 concentration (approximately 100 pM) was from 92% to 120%, average
recovery equaling 103%. The range of recoveries for HAMA samples
supplemented with a high HE4 concentration (approximately 500 pM) was
from 93% to 105%, average recovery equaling 98%. The HAMA
concentrations ranged from 80 to > 400 ng/ml. The overall average recovery
was 101% for both HE4 concentrations. Less than 15% average interference
was observed in the assay with samples up to 400 ng/mL of HAMA.
Rheumatoid factor interference was assessed in a manner similar with HAMA
interference. Five RF specimens and 2 normal serum samples were each spilt
into 3 equal aliquots and supplemented with two different concentrations of
HE4. Samples were tested as unknowns with the assay, in 4 replicates. Two
lots of kit were used in the study. The range of recoveries for rheumatoid
factor samples supplemented with a low HE4 concentration (approximately
120 pM) was from 87% to 107%, average recovery equaling 98%. The range
of recoveries for rheumatoid factor samples supplemented with a high HE4
concentration (approximately 525 pM) was from 90% to 106%, average
recovery equaling 93%. The RF concentrations ranged from 21 to 568 IU/ml.
7

--- Page 8 ---
The overall average recovery was 95% for both HE4 concentrations. Less than
15% average interference was observed in the assay with samples containing
elevated levels of rheumatoid factor up to 568 IU/mL.
To evaluate the potential interference from several chemotherapeutic agents in
the assay, NCCLS (CLSI) guideline, EP7-A, was used to design the
interference experiments. Two samples of human serum were supplemented
with each chemotherapeutic as a potential interfering substance. The list of
various chemotherapeutics prepared for spiking is described in the following
table. Control samples were spiked with an equal volume of each respective
solvent.
Chemotherapeutic Agent Test Concentration
Carboplatin 500 μg/mL
Cisplatin 165 μg/mL
Clotrimazole 0.3 μg/mL
Cyclophosphamide 500 μg/mL
Dexamethasone 10 μg/mL
Doxorubicin 1.16 μg/mL
Leucovorin 2.68 μg/mL
Melphalan 2.8 μg/mL
Methotrexate 45 μg/mL
Paclitaxel 3.5 ng/mL
One sample of human serum was spiked with ovarian cancer patient serum to
a concentration of about 90 pM HE4. This is used as a base pool and was split
into 2 aliquots for each chemotherapeutic agent to be tested. One aliquot was
spiked with the stock solutions of the chemotherapeutic agents (at a 1:20
dilution) to the test concentration. One aliquot was spiked with an equal
volume of the respective solvent for use as a control sample.
A second sample of human serum was spiked with recombinant HE4 antigen
rather than serum from an ovarian cancer patient to a concentration of ~90
pM. This is used as a base pool and was split into 2 aliquots for each
chemotherapeutic to be tested. The control samples and the samples
supplemented with chemotherapeutics were tested as unknowns with the HE4
EIA Kit, in 4 replicates, randomly pipetted. Two kit lots were used in the
study. The individual sample replicates were evaluated using valid calibration
curves and kit controls were tested and evaluated to determine assay validity.
The mean concentration obtained from the 4 replicates of each sample with
the added chemotherapeutics was compared to the mean value of the
corresponding control sample with solvent only. The percentage recovery was
calculated. The range of the percent recoveries for samples with added
chemotherapeutics was 96.2% to 106.2%. Less than 15% interference was
observed in the assay meeting the predetermined acceptance criteria of 100 ±
15% recovery for each chemotherapeutic tested.
f. Assay cut-off:
There is no assay cut-off for monitoring the progression of epithelial ovarian
cancer.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A predicate does not exist for this device so no comparison study was
performed.
b. Matrix comparison:
Only serum is used as the sample matrix.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity Clinical specificity:
The general study objective for the clinical study was to obtain sufficient
clinical data to support the proposed intended use and to show non-inferiority
of the HE4 EIA Kit to the Abbott ARCHITECT CA 125 11 immunoassay.
Although the HE4 EIA Kit measures a different antigen than the
ARCHITECT CA 125 11 assay, the intended uses are the same.
To determine the utility of the HE4 EIA Kit as an aid in monitoring ovarian
cancer progression in women diagnosed with invasive epithelial ovarian
cancer, serum sets were assessed from multiple serial samplings at various
clinical evaluation times during surveillance monitoring. This study used only
retrospective serum samples. The specimens used in the monitoring study
were obtained from a large cancer center in the United States. No samples
were specifically drawn for this study. The sample inclusion and exclusion
criteria are as follows:
Inclusion criteria
• Ovarian cancer
• Appropriate clinical data
• Minimum 0.5 mL volume available
• Normal appearance
• Informed consent
• Appropriate information
Exclusion criteria
• No diagnosis of ovarian cancer
• Insufficient volume
• Multiple freeze-thaw stored or shipped @4ºC
• Icteric, lipemic, hemolytic, substantial particulates
• No informed consent
Serum samples were obtained from 80 women with epithelial ovarian cancer
undergoing serial surveillance monitoring of cancer progression. Changes in
clinical status were determined using imaging data in the patient's record. This
information used only tangible evidence of progression, or lack of
progression, such as enlargement of lesions or other objective physical
evidence. It should be noted that because the endpoint of this clinical trial was
to demonstrate non-inferiority to a previous device, the primary endpoint was
to compare changes in the HE4 EIA Kit concentrations over time with
9

--- Page 10 ---
changes in clinical status in comparison with changes in ARCHITECT CA
125 II concentrations over time and changes in clinical status. These 80 cases
consisted of the following subgroups:
1) Women with no evidence of disease after therapy at last blood draw. No
Evidence of Disease - NED: A complete lack of clinical evidence of
disease as determined by the treating physician.
2) Women with evidence of residual but stable disease after therapy at last
blood draw. Stable Disease - SD: Clinical evidence that the disease has not
changed since last assessment as determined by the treating physician.
3) Women with progressive (recurring) disease after primary therapy at last
blood draw. Progressive Disease - PD: Clinical evidence of growth in the
primary tumor or the appearance of new tumors since the last assessment
as determined by the treating physician.
4) Women with disease responsive to therapy at the last blood draw.
Responding Disease - RD: Clinical evidence that there is a shrinking of
the primary tumor and no evidence of new tumors as determined by the
treating physician.
The outcome measure for this analysis was the determination of progression
of disease from one time point to a succeeding time point. In this analysis, the
total sample is the number of all clinical visits made by all patients after
diagnosis of ovarian cancer and prior to death, loss to follow up or remission
of disease. Disease progression from visit to visit was determined by the
patient's physician based on either or both of the following:
1. Examination of the patient for clinical signs and symptoms, including the
results of laboratory tests that are current standard of care for the
assessment of ovarian cancer disease status. The determination of
progression/non-progression included the use of a CA125 assay in some
cases. In the instances where CA125 was used the ARCHITECT CA125II,
was not used in determination of progression/non-progression.
2. Examination of radiographic findings (imaging) that can be used for the
assessment of ovarian cancer disease status. Radiographic findings include
results from CAT scans, PET scans, MRI and x-Ray images, as well as
ultrasound. Second look surgery results, where available, will also be
utilized.
Of 80 women in whom assay values and a progression/non-progression
determination was made, 73 subjects had staging information. Of 73 staged
subjects, 15% were stage I, II while 85% were stage III, IV. Of 71 subjects
having menopausal status determinations, 66 were post-menopausal, 3 pre-
menopausal, and 2 peri-menopausal.
A definition of the percentage change in assay value was chosen to ensure that
the change in the test device would not be attributed to assay variation. A
positive change in the HE4 EIA Kit value was defined as an increase in the
value that is at least 25% greater than the previous value of the test. The level
10

--- Page 11 ---
of change represented 2.5 times the total CV% of the assay. Because the
maximum Total CV% for the HE4 EIA Kit was 9.3%, a 25% change was
chosen. Based on this cutoff for HE4, the following table represents the
number of all clinical visits for all 80 subjects at which a clinical evaluation of
progression/non-progression occurred and the percentage change category of
the subjects at these clinical evaluations:
%change HE4 Progression No progression Total
≥25% 76 57 133
<25% 50 171 221
Total 126 228 354
At this cut-off, the assay is informative with respect to progression/non-
progression. The true positive rate (0.603) minus the false positive rate (0.250)
is significantly greater than zero (difference 0.353, p < 0.001, 95% confidence
interval of difference 0.251 to 0.455).
Receiver-Operator Characteristics (ROC) curves were drawn for both CA 125
and HE4. The two curves are similar in their shape, with AUCs of 0.725
(95% CI = 0.675 to 0.770) for HE4 and 0.709 (95% CI = 0.659 to 0.756) for
CA 125. Given the overlap of the two 95% Confidence Intervals these two
curves are not statistically significantly different. The ROC analysis indicates
that the HE4 assay is not inferior to the CA125 assay for detecting cancer
progression.

There is currently no clinically accepted cut-off for use in monitoring cancer
progression in epithelial ovarian cancer subjects with this assay. The labeling
contains various percentage changes in HE4 from a previous value as
determined in the ROC analysis. The assay performance characteristics
(sensitivity and specificity) at each cut-off are indicated for use in a serial

--- Page 12 ---
surveillance monitoring situation where clinical outcome is categorized as
cancer progression/non-progression. The following table provides sensitivities
and specificities for HE4 using several cut-offs of percent change in HE4
values as determined in the clinical study.
Lower CI Upper CI

HE4 HE4 HE4 Specificity Specificity

41.2% 49.2% 83.3% 77.8% 87.9%
67.8% 39.7% 90.8% 86.3% 94.2%
A clinician could select any of several cut-off values but the estimated
performance will confined by the choice. Note further that at high sensitivity
or specificity (for example > 85%) values, the cut-off is likely not practical. A
decrease in HE4 of 29%, while giving approximately 95% sensitivity, is not
practical to aid in excluding progression due to the very high false positive
rate (0.86). Similarly, an increase in HE4 of 68%, while giving approximately
90% specificity, is also not practical to aid in detecting progression due to the
very high false negative rate (~0.60). Intermediate cut-off values would lead
to a trade-off in sensitivity and specificity and would reflect the clinician
preference for a given patient with a set of clinical symptoms and/or signs.
Based on the 25% change cutoff for CA125, the following table represents the
number of all clinical visits for all 80 subjects at which a clinical evaluation of
progression/non-progression occurred and the percentage change category of
the subjects at these clinical evaluations:
%change
CA125 Progression No progression Total
≥ 25% 87 71 158
<25% 39 157 196
Total 126 228 354
At this cut-off, the CA125 assay is informative with respect to
progression/non-progression. The true positive rate (0.691) minus the false
positive rate (0.311) is significantly greater than zero (difference 0.379, p <
0.001, 95% confidence interval of difference 0.278 to 0.480).
Due to the slight difference in HE4 assay performance compared with CA125
assay performance at a given cutoff, the ROC analysis was utilized to fix the
sensitivity percentage for cancer progression and estimate the cut-off value
and specificity percentage for the HE4 assay and CA125 assay. The following
table summarizes the cut-off and specificity values for the HE4 and CA125
assay at the same fixed sensitivity.

Note from the table that the cut-off and specificity for CA125 are different
from the cut-off and specificity for HE4. The specificity values for CA125
and HE4 are not statistically different at the respective cut-offs and sensitivity
values thus supporting non-inferiority of HE4 compared to CA 125. However,
the cut-off values are different in value and reflect different points on the
ROC curve compared with HE4 for a given sensitivity.
Of the subjects evaluated, there was no constant total follow-up time or
interval between visits. The percentage change in biomarker values reflected
the difference from the previous value regardless of the time interval between
visits. In order to assess if the differing time intervals contributed to
substantial percentage changes in biomarker and with marker performance,
the percentage change was adjusted by the time in months between clinical
evaluation visits. The adjustment was calculated as the percentage change per
month between clinical visits. The percentage change per month was
evaluated by ROC analysis against clinical progression/non-progression. The
area under the ROC curve (0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.669 to 0.784) did
not differ from the area without adjustment. Therefore, the time interval
between clinical evaluation visits did not affect overall assay performance.
The %change per month and specificity values at fixed sensitivity is
summarized in the following table:
HE4 CA125
Sensitivity cut-off Specificity lower CI upper CI cutoff specificity
94.5% -17.0% 12.3% 8.3% 17.3% -33.2% 13.6%

25.0% 46.8% 96.9% 93.8% 98.8% 81.8% 95.6%
Note from the table that the percentage change per month values are dissimilar
from the %change as described above. This analysis indicates substantial
differences in actual percentage change but otherwise do not reflect
differences in assay performance for HE4 or CA125. It is unlikely that a
clinician would prefer or consistently evaluate marker values as a percent
change per month compared with a percentage change from the previous

marker value. Since the performance is not altered and since special
recommendations to clinicians would be confusing, no special suggestion
need occur. It is unclear if the percentage change per month would become
important with other biomarkers.
Assay performance for the HE4 assay was examined in a single table to
correlate the 4 different clinical states (No evidence of disease, responding
disease, stable disease, and progressive disease) with three categories of
%change in HE4 value. The table below represents subject counts for all
subjects and all visits based upon data in the clinical study:
%change HE4 NED Responding Stable Progressive Total
<-25% 6 12 22 10 50
-25% ≤ x ≤ 25% 50 10 71 40 171
>25% 18 4 35 78 135
Total 74 26 128 128 356
In the table the percentage change in HE4 is categorized as a %change less
than -25%, %change between -25% and 25%, and %change greater than 25%.
The performance parameters for each clinical disease state are as follows:
Evaluation
Performance parameter Value S.E. parameter Value S.E.
Sensitivity (responding)= 46.2% ± 0.098 TPR-FPR= 34.6% ± 9.9%
Specificity (responding)= 88.5% ± 0.018 95% CI 15.2% 54.1%
Sensitivity (stable)= 55.5% ± 0.044 TPR-FPR= 11.6% ± 5.5%
Specificity (stable)= 56.1% ± 0.033 95% CI 0.9% 22.4%
Sensitivity (progression)= 60.9% ± 0.043 TPR-FPR= 35.9% ± 5.2%
Specificity (progression)= 75.0% ± 0.029 95% CI 25.8% 46.1%
For the three clinical disease states responding disease, stable disease, and
progressive disease the HE4 assay is informative since the difference in true
positive rate and the false positive is higher than 0% difference (p < 0.05).
For the disease state no evidence of disease (NED), the sensitivity and
specificity when HE4 is not increasing (i.e. ≤ 25% change) was 75.7% ± S.E.
5.0% and 41.5% ± S.E. 2.9%, respectively. The HE4 assay, when not
increasing, is informative since the difference in true positive rate and false
positive rate was 17.2% ± S.E. 5.8% (95% confidence interval of difference
5.8% to 28.5%).
For the 4 clinical disease states evaluated, the HE4 assay is informative when
categorized as < -25% change, between -25% and 25% change, and > 25%
change.
In the 3 x 4 table above, of the 74 subjects with NED, a substantial number
(50) have a %change in HE4 that is between -25% and 25%. This number
would not be unexpected for subjects with no evidence of clinically active or
14

responding disease. It suggests that a %change in such subjects is small and
not sufficiently robust at discriminating subjects with inactive or no evidence
of disease compared with active or responding disease. One could assess
performance by comparing a patient’s HE4 value for elevation above the
upper limit of the normal range to detect a change in status from no evidence
or inactive disease.
NED not NED Total
HE4 ≤ 150 pM 66 102 168
HE4 > 150 pM 8 180 188
Total 74 282 356
When using the upper limit of normal subjects, 150 pM, as determined from
normal healthy pre-menopausal or post-menopausal women, the sensitivity of
the HE4 assay for no evidence or inactive disease was 89% (95% confidence
interval 79.8% to 95.2%). The specificity of the HE4 assay for no evidence of
disease at 150 pM value was 64% (95% confidence interval 57.9% to 69.4%).
The sensitivity and specificity of the HE4 assay at a single HE4 value is
higher than the sensitivity and specificity of the %change in HE4 of ≤ 25%
(75.7% sensitivity and 41.5% specificity).
b. Other clinical supportive data:
One thousand one hundred fifty (1150) serum patient specimens with various
conditions were assessed using the HE4 assay to establish the ranges in
various subject groups. The following patient cohorts were assembled to

All of the serum samples that were used in this study were collected under an
IRB approved protocol or when the local IRB determined that Informed
Consent was not necessary. Samples were obtained from either commercial
vendors of specimen banks or collected prospectively from clinical sites under
the clinical study protocol. Samples were obtained from one source as
“remnant samples” and the local IRB determined that Informed Consent was
not necessary. All samples were tested in duplicate using the HE4 assay. The
individual sample replicates were evaluated using valid calibration curves and
the mean of the replicates was calculated. The HE4 assay controls were tested
and evaluated for each assay to determine assay validity. This study was
performed at three (3) sites.

with benign gynecologic diseases. Twenty three (23) samples (6.6%) from the
cohort of 347 women with benign gynecologic diseases had HE4
concentrations exceeding the Upper Limit of normal. These included: 3
subjects with cysts, 10 subjects with cystadenomas, 6 subjects with fibromas,
and 4 subjects with other conditions (one normal sample, one hemorrhagic
follicle, one ovarian torsion and one myoma).
The HE4 assay showed lower specificity relative to non-disease subjects in
patients with congestive heart failure. This was an unexpected finding and is
not associated with the known tissue expression of the HE4 (WFDC2) gene or
protein. Similarly, the assay showed a lower specificity in patients with
“Other Benign Diseases”. The patients with non-gynecologic benign disease
would likely be clinically distinguishable from subjects with ovarian cancer or
adnexal masses.
Sensitivity for breast, colon, and endometrial cancers was low. HE4 is
elevated in a minority of these cancers. The sensitivity of HE4 in lung cancer
was 42% and is consistent with the known up-regulation of the HE4 gene and
protein in lung cancers, particularly adenocarcinoma of the lung.
4. Clinical cut-off:
There is currently no clinically accepted cut-off for use in monitoring cancer
progression in epithelial ovarian cancer subjects with this assay. A cut-off for use
in this situation could be a percentage change from a previously determined value
and would be expected to correlate with the clinical state at the time of assay and
clinical evaluation. The labeling contains various percentage changes in HE4
from a previous value as determined in the clinical study. The assay performance
characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) at each cut-off are indicated for use in a
serial surveillance monitoring situation where clinical outcome is categorized as
cancer progression/non-progression.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
To determine the normal range of the HE4 EIA Kit using serum samples from an
apparently healthy pre-menopausal and post-menopausal population, a sample of
204 females who were apparently disease free was assessed. The following table
describes the included women:
Cohort Number
Apparently Healthy
Normal healthy female: pre menopausal 76
Normal healthy female: post menopausal 103
Additional Healthy Female 3*
Pregnant females 22
Total healthy female subjects 204

their ages.

All samples were tested in duplicate. Two kit lots were used in the study. The
individual sample replicates were evaluated using valid calibration curves and
the mean of the two replicates was calculated. The kit controls were tested and
evaluated for each assay to determine assay validity. This study was
performed at two (2) sites.
Menopausal status was determined in one of two ways. For some patients, the
menopausal status was known and recorded on data sheets. For other patients,
only the age was known at the time of sample draw. For these patients, ages of
<48y were considered pre-menopausal. Similarly, ages >52y were considered
post-menopausal. This is based on the known median and mean age of
menopause for US women (51 years of age) as measured by the American
College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. The Figure below is a frequency plot
of the assay concentrations grouped according to 25 pM HE4 concentrations
ranges.
The figure shows that HE4 concentrations are not normally distributed for the
subject populations. The sponsor determined 95% Upper Limits for each
population using a non-parametric, 1-tailed analysis. The non-parametric
upper 95%, one-tailed confidence interval was determined for the entire set,
each subset and the subset containing pre-menopausal and pregnant females
by percentile ranking. The results are presented in the following table.
Sample N Percentile Ranking 95% Confidence Limits
Class Upper Limit (pM) Lower Upper
All Normal Samples 204 153.4 102.4 205.4
Post Menopausal 103 154.1 93.5 221
Pre Menopausal 76 119.1 84.5 293.5
Pre Menopausal + Pregnant 98 136.7 84.7 215.9
Using percentile ranking analysis, 95% of all healthy subjects and pregnant
females had HE4 values below 153 pM. The 95% confidence intervals show a
18

wide range of values. This is affected, at least in part, by two samples with
very high HE4 values (>600 pM). However, there is no information known
about these healthy subjects that justifies removing them from the analysis.
Because it is sometimes difficult to be certain of menopausal status, and
because the 95% confidence interval for these samples ranges from 102 to 205
pM, the sponsor recommends an Upper Limit of 150 pM for the assay.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
