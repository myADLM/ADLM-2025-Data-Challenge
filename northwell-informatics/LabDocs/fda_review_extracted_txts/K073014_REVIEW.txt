I. Device Description:
The INFINITI 2C9 & VKORC1 Multiplex Assay for Warfarin is an in vitro diagnostic
device which utilizes proprietary film-based microarray technology combined with process
automation, reagent management, and software technology for the detection and genotyping
of the 2C9*2, 2C9*3, and VKORC1 3673 (-1639) mutations from human whole peripheral
blood samples.
The INFINITI 2C9 & VKORC1 Multiplex Assay for Warfarin is comprised of the
BioFilmChip™ Microarray, the Intellipac Reagent Module and the PCR Amplification
Mix. The INFINITI 2C9 & VKORC1 Multiplex Assay for Warfarin should be run
using the AutoGenomics INFINITI Analyzer.
The BioFilmChip Microarray consists of a polyester film coated with proprietary
multi-layer components designed for DNA analysis. There can be up to 240 spots per
microarray with each spot representing a different allele. The microarrays are
designed to be assay specific.
The Intellipac Reagent Module, which acts as a communication link, contains up to
eight reservoirs that house the test reagents and has an integrated memory chip. The
assay protocol resides in this memory chip, and upon request is loaded to the
INFINITI Analyzer. Information such as expiration date of reagents, volume usage,
time of use, and operation parameters are archived in the memory chip and appear on
the worklist (run report). The PCR Amplification Mix consists of the reagents needed
for the PCR amplification step of the assay.
The INFINITI Analyzer is an instrument used for clinical multiplex systems intended
to measure and sort multiple signals from a clinical sample. The INFINITI Analyzer
is designed to measure fluorescence signals of labeled DNA target hybridized to
BioFilmChip microarrays. The INFINITI Analyzer automates the 2C9 and VKORC1
assays and integrates all the discrete processes of sample (PCR amplicon) handling,
reagent management, hybridization, detection, and results analysis. The assays are
processed automatically and read by the built-in confocal microscope. Results are
analyzed and presented as genotype calls.

The INFINITI 2C9 & VKORC1 Multiplex Assay for Warfarin is designed to
simultaneously detect the *2 and *3 CYP4502C9 genetic variants and the VKORC1
3673 (-1639) intronic variant. The assay protocol is based on five major processes:
(a) DNA extraction
(b) PCR amplification of purified DNA from human genomic DNA
(c) Labeling of the amplified product (allele specific primer extension)
(d) Hybridization of the labeled amplified product to a microarray by signature
Tag/Capture probe hybridization under isothermal conditions.
(e) Scanning of the microarray

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Site-to-site: To assess site-to-site reproducibility, three clinical sites (one
internal, two external) performed testing using three independent analyzers
and three different operators. Three lots of 2C9-VKORC1 assay reagents
were used. All three sites tested the same panel of samples, which included
7 genomic DNA samples and 5 clinical samples. Each site used a different
DNA extraction method for the clinical samples. The study gave a 99.0%
call rate based on 1283 correct calls out of a total of 1296 genotype calls.
There were 13 “no calls” in the study, but no incorrect calls were observed.

a Site 1: no call given; the error log documented “#41 THS Error Tip not sensed.” The instrument tip
height sensor did not detect a pipette tip for that sample and therefore no results were provided for the
sample.
b Site 2: no call given for one of these samples due to tip sensor not sensing liquid due to low volume of
wash buffer in one sample; two other samples also gave no calls due to not enough sample added
c Site 3: one sample had no call; not enough sample added
Chip-to-chip: Using the same genomic DNA sample and the same instrument,
the assay was run using five microarray chips from one lot of R-Chip, with
each microarray chip run five times. This was repeated with two other
instruments. Two-way ANOVA of the mean RFU readings, p-values for
chip-to-chip reproducibility were significant (p > 0.001).

Controls: Positive or negative controls are not included with this assay. The
manufacturer has recommended that a positive (heterozygous and/or
homozygous for the three genotypes) sample for each mutation, a negative
control (a sample that does not contain the mutation of interest, i.e., a wild
type sample); and a “Non-Template Control” be included with each test run.
All quality control requirements and testing should be performed in
conformance with local, state and/or federal regulations.
Pre-immobilized negative and positive controls: These controls are related to
the hybridization process, and indicate that the hybridization has taken place.
There are five (5) negative control spots and three (3) positive control spots.
The negative control is a 3’biotinylated 24mer to which nothing should bind.
The positive control is a 3’biotinylated 24mer that hybridizes the
complementary Cy5 labeled oligonucleotide.
Stability: BioFilmChip Microarray is stable for 180 days at 15-30oC, the
Intellipac Reagent for 180 days when stored at 2-8oC, and the Amplification
Mix is stable for 180 days when stored at -10oC. Stability testing protocols,
acceptance criteria for stability testing and release criteria have been reviewed
and found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
In order to determine the lowest concentration of DNA at which this assay is
accurate, serial dilutions (200, 100, 50, 25, 10, 1, 0.1 ng) of a genomic sample
were assayed multiple times using the 2C9-VKORC1 assay. Low detection
limit was determined as 1 ng of purified DNA per reaction, which is the
lowest DNA amount that gave the correct genotyping call for all test runs.
The 0.1 ng DNA sample did not always provide a test result. The
recommended DNA concentration for the INFINITI 2C9 & VKORC1
Multiplex Assay for Warfarin is 25ng/µl. The assay requires 2µl of DNA
sample or the equivalent of 50ng per test.
In addition, analytical studies demonstrated that DNA concentrations of 100ng
and 200ng which were in excess of the recommended sample (50ng) did not
interfere with the INFINITI 2C9 & VKORC1 Multiplex Assay.
e. Analytical specificity:
Evaluation of potential interference from bilirubin, cholesterol, and heparin
demonstrated that presence of these compounds in concentrations of 8mg/dl
bilirubin, 70mg/dl cholesterol and 133v/dl heparin does not interfere with the
INFINITI 2C9 & VKORC1 Multiplex Assay. Three whole blood samples
were split and spiked with various concentrations of cholesterol, bilirubin and
heparin, the DNA was extracted and run on the INFINITI 2C9 & VKORC1
Multiplex Assay. The correct genotype calls for these three samples were
obtained at all compound concentrations.

--- Page 9 ---
Sample carry-over:
Two genomic DNA samples with different genotypes and water were used in
this study. Four ‘samples’ were tested in this order: a high DNA
concentration sample (300ng), a low DNA concentration sample (10ng) of a
different genotype, followed by the high DNA concentration sample again,
then a water blank. This protocol was run multiple times, and in all cases, the
correct call (or an indeterminate call for the water ‘sample’) was obtained,
illustrating no sample carry-over between samples.
Assay carry-over:
Assay interference study was conducted to demonstrate that running the Assay
for Factor II & Factor V (k060564) and the 2C9 & VKORC1 Multiplex assay
on the same instrument does not affect the results of each assay. These assays
utilize different chips and reagents, but use the same wash buffer stored on the
instrument. Two genomic DNA samples were used for the 2C9-VKORC1
assays with distinct genotypes at all loci, and two other genomic samples were
used for the Factor II-Factor V assay (also with distinct genotypes at the two
loci). On the first day, using one INFINITI analyzer, one run of 2C9-
VKORC1 assays (consisting of 4 assays) was followed by one run of Factor
II-Factor V assays (consisting of 4 assays). Simultaneously, on another
INFINITI analyzer, the testing was repeated with samples tested in reverse
order. These studies were repeated on a second day. All genotype calls made
by the 8 runs were correct. Assay interference was not detected.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison study was completed at three external sites. All three
sites compared the results of samples run on the INFINITI 2C9-VKORC1
Multiplex Assay to bi-directional sequencing results (sequencing was
completed at one site). Each site provided their own clinical samples.
