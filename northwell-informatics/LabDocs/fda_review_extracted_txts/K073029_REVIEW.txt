viral infections in humans and is not intended to detect Influenza C.
A negative test is presumptive and it is recommended these results be confirmed by cell
culture. Negative results do not preclude influenza or RSV virus infection and should not
be used as the sole basis for treatment or other management decisions.
Performance characteristics for Influenza A Virus were established when Influenza A/H3
and A/H1 were the predominant Influenza A viruses in circulation. When other Influenza
A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.
If infections with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture
should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and
culture specimens.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Cepheid SmartCycler II Real Time Instrument
I. Device Description:
The ProFlu+ Assay enables detection and differentiation of Influenza A Virus, Influenza
B Virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (Types A and B), and Internal Control.
An overview of the procedure is as follows:
1. Collect nasopharyngeal swab specimens from symptomatic patients using a
polyester, rayon or nylon tipped swab and place into viral transport medium (refer
to Materials Required but not Provided).
2. Add an Internal Control (IC) to every sample to monitor for inhibitors present in
the specimens.
3. Perform isolation and purification of nucleic acids using the MagNA Pure LC
Instrument (Roche) and the MagNA Pure Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit
(Roche).
4. Add purified nucleic acids to ProFlu+ Supermix along with enzymes included in
the ProFlu+ Detection Kit. The ProFlu+ Supermix contains oligonucleotide
primers and target-specific oligonucleotide probes. The primers are
complementary to highly conserved regions of genetic sequences for these
respiratory viruses. The probes are dual-labeled with a reporter dye attached to
the 5’-end and a quencher dye attached to the 3’-end (see Table below).
2

--- Page 3 ---
5. Perform reverse transcription of RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) and
subsequent amplification of DNA in a Cepheid SmartCycler®II instrument. In
this process, the probe anneals specifically to the template followed by primer
extension and amplification. The ProFlu+ Assay is based on Taqman chemistry,
which utilizes the 5’ – 3’ exonuclease activity of the Taq polymerase to cleave the
probe thus separating the reporter dye from the quencher. This generates an
increase in fluorescent signal upon excitation from a light source. With each
cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes,
further increasing fluorescent signal. The amount of fluorescence at any given
cycle is dependent on the amount of amplification products present at that time.
Fluorescent intensity is monitored during each PCR cycle by the real-time
instrument.

L. Test Principle:
See I
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Expected Values
The prevalence of Influenza and RSV varies each year with epidemics occurring during
the fall and winter months in the US. Variables that affect the rate of positivity observed
in respiratory testing include: the efficiency and timing of specimen collection, handling
and transport of the specimen, the time of year, age of the patient, and local disease
prevalence. During the 2006-2007 U.S. respiratory season, the combined prevalence of
Influenza A and Influenza B was 13.2% and in 2005-2006 the combined prevalence was
12.1%9. The prevalence of RSV during the 2005-2006 season was 16.2%10. In the 2007
6

--- Page 7 ---
ProFlu+ multi-center clinical study (samples collected between February and April), the
prevalence as observed with culture of Influenza A was 15.8%, Influenza B was 5.4%
and RSV was 4.2%. As influenza and RSV seasons overlap, dual positive infections can
occur. During this study, culture and the ProFlu+ Assay each detected one Influenza A
and RSV dual-positive (although not the same sample) and ProFlu+ detected one
Influenza A and Influenza B dual-positive out of the 901 total samples included in the
study. Because the incidence of a triple infection of Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV
is low, it is recommended that the samples undergo repeat testing if nucleic acids from all
three analytes are detected in a single sample.
Clinical Performance
Performance characteristics of the ProFlu+ Assay were established during a
prospective study at 3 U.S. clinical laboratories and a retrospective study at 1 U.S.
site during the 2006-2007 respiratory virus season (February – April). Samples
used for this study were nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens that were collected
for routine influenza or RSV testing by each site.
The reference method was rapid culture (shell vial) followed by direct fluorescent
antibody (DFA) screening and identification.
A total of 891 NP swab samples were tested with the ProFlu+ Assay and by
culture. Five (5) samples that initially gave unresolved results remained
unresolved upon retesting with the ProFlu+ Assay and are not included in the
analysis below. All 5 samples were culture negative.
A total of 23 samples were DFA Respiratory Virus Screen positive (screening
reagent detects Influenza A and B, RSV, Parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 and
Adenovirus), but contained too few cells to obtain a specific positive
identification. 21 of these 23 samples were also positive by the ProFlu+ Assay (9
Influenza A positive, 11 Influenza B positive and 1 RSV positive) and genetic
sequencing analysis confirmed the identification of the specific virus. The other 2
DFA screen positive samples were negative by the ProFlu+ Assay and sequence
analysis confirmed that they were negative for Influenza A, Influenza B and RSV;
these 2 samples were considered true negatives. Discrepant analysis for samples
where ProFlu+ Assay and culture results were in disagreement was performed
using RT-PCR with virus specific primers obtained from literature followed by
sequencing.

Analytical Specificity
The analytical specificity of the ProFlu+ Assay was evaluated by testing a panel of 50
cultures consisting of 22 viral,
27 bacterial, and 1 yeast strain representing common respiratory pathogens or flora
commonly present in nasopharynx. Bacteria and yeast were tested at concentrations of
106 to 107 CFU/mL. Viruses were tested at concentrations of 103 to 106 TCID /mL.
50
Samples were extracted using the Roche MagNA Pure LC and tested in triplicate.
Analytical specificity of the ProFlu+ Assay was 100%.

Competitive Inhibition
Competitive inhibition of the ProFlu+ Assay was evaluated using simulated samples
with varying concentrations of Influenza A Virus (LoD to 3 logs above LoD) and
Respiratory Syncytial Virus A (LoD to 4 logs above LoD) in a single sample.
Samples were extracted using the Roche MagNA Pure LC and tested in triplicate.
The presence of both Influenza A Virus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus A at varying
concentrations in a single sample had no effect on the analytical sensitivity (limit of
detection or LoD) of the ProFlu+ Assay.
Carry-over/Contamination
In an internal study there was no evidence of carry-over/cross contamination with the
ProFlu+ Assay using the Roche MagNA Pure LC automated nucleic acid extraction
instrument.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
