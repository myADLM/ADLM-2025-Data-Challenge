K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
• ISO 15197: In vitro diagnostic test systems - Requirements for blood-glucose
monitoring systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus.
L. Test Principle:
Glucose measurement is based on electrical potential caused by the reaction of glucose with the
reagents contained on the strip's electrodes. The glucose in the sample is oxidized by the
enzyme glucose oxidase, and the current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured
and converted to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is
proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Testing was done using whole blood samples spiked with five different glucose
concentrations, three different reagent lots, and 10 different AG-605 blood glucose
meters. Each combination of multivariate factors was evaluated using 10
measurements. Day-to-day precision was evaluated using three glucose control
solutions with concentration levels, low, normal, and high. The day-to-day precision
was evaluated over a ten-day period using three different reagent lots. The summary of
test results is presented below.
Repeatability (within-day precision):

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Testing was done with 11 spiked whole blood samples over the range of 22-596
mg/dL (as measured by the reference method), compared with the values generated
from YSI-2300 analyzer. A regression analysis showed linearity of AG-605 blood
glucose monitoring systems with a linear regression of y = 1.0388x - 3.4407 and an r2 =
0.9971.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Open vial stability was tested using three levels of control solution every day over a 3
month period. The sponsor's acceptance criteria for the control solution (<±15 mg/dL for
less than 100 mg/dL glucose and < ±15% bias for samples greater than or equal to 100
mg/dL glucose) was met which supported an open vial stability claim of 3 months.

70,120, and 230 mg/dL. These samples were tested against control samples which had a
blank solvent added at the same volume as the interferent. Samples were tested 10 times
and the percent difference of the interfering samples was calculated and compared to the
control samples. The following substances were tested.

Acetaminophen, salicylates, uric acid, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and other reducing
substances (when occurring in normal therapeutic concentrations) do not significantly affect
results. The sponsor notes in the labeling that abnormally high concentrations in blood may
cause inaccurately high results. Triglyceride of up to 400 mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L) do not
affect the result. When triglyceride was tested at 500 mg/dL in a sample with a glucose
concentration of 400 mg/dL, it showed a bias of 16%, however all other glucose
concentrations tested showed bias of <±11%. The labeling will indicate that triglyceride
concentrations of 400 mg/dL and below do not affect results. All other compounds tested
above showed biases within the sponsors acceptance criteria of a bias <±15%.
The effect of hematocrit levels of 20 - 70% was tested on whole blood samples spiked
with six hematocrit levels at glucose values (7 levels) distributed within the measuring
range (25 - 492 mg/dL) of the device. The values generated were compared with the
glucose values from YSI-2300 analyzer. The regression analysis for each hematocrit level
is summarized in the table below. The results generated by the device are comparable to the
values of YSI-2300 instrument at hematocrit levels between 20-60%. The sponsor will
claim a hematocrit range of 30 to 55%.

An altitude study was performed with whole blood samples from 20 volunteers (glucose
range: 68-157 mg/dL) and 3 control solutions at low (40 mg/dL), medium (110 mg/dL)
and high (350 mg/dL) concentrations tested 20 times each. All the controls met the
acceptability criterion of CV<5% for the control solutions measured at sea level and at an
altitude of 10,000 feet. The data submitted support use of the device up to 10,000 feet.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Samples from 300 volunteers with glucose concentrations distributed over the range of 20 -
546 mg/dL were evaluated at three different hospitals. Each blood sample from the
volunteers was divided in two, one was tested by YSI-2300 and the other was tested by
AG-605 blood glucose meter. Percent distribution of the samples corresponding to the
glucose concentration ranged as follows: 20-50 mg/dL -5.7%; 51-110 mg/dL - 32.7%;
111- 150 mg/dL - 19.3%; 151-250 mg/dL - 19.6%; 251- 400 mg/dL - 18.3%; and 401-600
mg/dL - 4.3%. To obtain the blood glucose concentrations less than 40 and more than 400
mg/dL, a pooled capillary whole blood specimen was spiked with the desired glucose
levels. Based on data analysis, the device met the minimum system accuracy requirement
established according to the ISO 15197 guidelines, which is 95% of the individual
differences are within ±15mg/dL when glucose concentrations are less than 75mg/dL, and
are within ±20% when glucose concentrations are >75mg/dL. In comparison with YSI-
2300, all three sites showed regression correlation (r2) values ranging between 0.981-0.992.
Results for all three sites combined and for each AG-605 meter using strip AGS-600 are
given below.

A usability test was performed by 50 volunteers and healthcare professionals respectively
with glucose levels ranging from 58 to 369 mg/dL when measured by the healthcare
professional. Each volunteer was offered one AG-605 blood glucose meter; three test
strips (three different lots), one vial of control solution, one user manual, one lancing
device and three lancets. After reviewing the materials, the user performed their own finger
sticks and tested themselves using the blood glucose monitoring system. Immediately after
the user's self-test, a second blood sample was collected and the healthcare professional
tested it with the same blood glucose monitoring system. Comparing the two test results, it
was determined that users can test by themselves correctly according to the instruction for
use. Test results are summarized below.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger only. Since
the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no special handling or
storage issues.
5. Calibration:
A code number is provided with each batch of test strips to calibrate the meter for that
batch. The code number is associated with the meter by inserting a test strip and entering
the code number to match that found on the test strip bottle. No further calibrations are
required of the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor has three levels of controls available for this meter with one level coming
with the kit and the other two levels being available through the distributor. When a test
strip is inserted into the meter, a control can be run. An acceptable range for each control
level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is referred to a troubleshooting
section (in the control test section) of the owner's manual to identify possible reasons
control results may fall outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
"Performance Characteristics" Section above:
None
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
