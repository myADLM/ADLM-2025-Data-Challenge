H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
SpermCheck Vasectomy is a rapid qualitative test that detects low concentrations
of sperm at or above 250,000 sperm/mL, in human semen as an aid for
vasectomized men. For in vitro, over the counter home use.

I. Device Description:
The SpermCheck Vasectomy test is designed to detect the presence or absence of
sperm in semen following a vasectomy. Since sperm persist in the male
reproductive tract for some time after a vasectomy it is necessary to continue
other methods of contraception until those sperm have been voided. With this
simple Sperm Check Vasectomy test the user can quickly know when the amount
of sperm in his ejaculate has dropped to very low levels and it is safe to
discontinue other forms of contraception. The SpermCheck Vasectomy test device
is designed to give a positive result at or above 250,000 sperm/mL and negative
result below 250,000 sperm/mL.

L. Test Principle:
SpermCheck Vasectomy test is a rapid qualitative test detecting the presence of sperm
in human semen at 250,000 sperm/mL and above. The test employs solid-phase
chromatographic immunoassay technology and sperm are detected using antibodies
against sperm acrosome-specific protein analyte SP10. This protein is a post meiotic
gene product expressed selectively in spermatids. In the test procedure, a semen
sample mixed with a test solution is dispensed into the sample well, the sample
migrates into the pads containing lyophilized detector antibody that is conjugated to
gold dye. If the sample contains sperm, upon hydration by the applied sample,
complexes are formed consisting of antibody-dye + antigen (SP10). The complexes
and excess hydrated antibodies migrate forward via capillary action on the
nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane serves as a solid support upon which
capture antibody (test band) and anti-species IgG antibodies (control band) are
immobilized. The immobilization of these reagents on the nitrocellulose membrane,
in defined areas, allows for the formation of distinct colored bands that can be read
visually. The complex of antibody-dye + antigen is captured by antibody on the
membrane and a red line appears at the test band on the membrane.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was performed by carrying out the test for two days by
three different operators with two lots of devices. The samples were prepared
by diluting the pooled normal semen to the appropriate sperm concentrations.
The samples were randomly distributed. The tested concentrations were 0.
125,000, 251,000, 353,000, and 706,000 sperm/mL. The results agreed 100%
with the expected results. No difference in the performance was found
between lots, days, and operators.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
N/A
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Real time stability testing has been performed. At each test time point,
negative, very low positive (approximately the level of sensitivity), and
medium positive (2 times the level of sensitivity) controls were tested. At each
time point, each sample level was tested in triplicate. Two lots of test devices
have been tested and the test results are acceptable up to 16 months at ambient
temperature.
d. Detection limit:
The SpermCheck Vasectomy test was designed to show positive results from
samples containing sperm at concentrations at or above the sensitivity limit of
250,000 sperm/mL. Semen samples were collected from normal men and
pooled. The initial counting of pooled semen by Hemacytometer was 93.6
million sperm/mL. The semen was diluted with semen from a pool of
vasectomized male donors to a sperm concentration of 406,000 sperm/mL. All
other concentrations were prepared from this semen sample by serially
diluting with pooled semen from vasectomized men. The concentrations
prepared were 406,000, 258,000, 129,000, 64,500, and 21,500 sperm/mL. At
each concentration the SpermCheck Vasectomy test was repeated 10 times
with each lot of devices. Two lots of SpermCheck Vasectomy devices were
used for the experiment. Therefore, 20 replicates at each concentration and a
total of 120 tests were tested.

e. Analytical specificity:
The cross reactivity and potential interference of various substances on the
SpermCheck Vasectomy test were tested by spiking each substance into the
250,000 sperm/mL semen sample and into the semen from a vasectomized
male (no sperm in the semen) to the desired concentration. Each concentration
was tested in triplicate. All substances showed no cross-reactivity or
interference at the level tested.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A study was designed to test the performance of the SpermCheck Vasectomy
test compared to the WHO standard procedure of determining sperm
concentration with a Hemacytometer (the predicate device). SpermCheck
Vasectomy is a semi-quantitative test that reports samples as containing sperm
concentrations above or below 250,000 sperm/mL. The study was performed
at two clinical sites by professional laboratory personnel. A total of 145 semen
samples were tested, however one test result was excluded from the analysis
since the result was not read at the correct reading time given in the test
protocol. Since the detection level of SpermCheck Vasectomy is 250,000
sperm/mL, the data comparison was made with this concentration as a
decision level between positive and negative.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
I. A consumer use study was conducted to determine the test performance
when used by unassisted lay users following the instructions in the package
insert. The study was conducted in two ways: 1) Performance of the consumer
at home with his own semen sample; 2) Performance of the consumer with
provided semen samples. The minimum target number was 50 people for each
study.
In the study of the consumer at home with his own semen sample 51 subjects
were enrolled with 31 who had been vasectomized and 20 who had not.
Laboratory personnel performed a hemacytometer count on unused sample
returned to the lab by the consumer. There was 100% agreement between the
SpermCheck Vasectomy results obtained by the home users and those
obtained by laboratory personnel retesting the same semen samples. For the
method comparison, there was 98% agreement between the SpermCheck
Vasectomy results and the hemacytometer counts with one disagreement
among the 50 tests.
In the study of consumers provided with semen samples 59 people (49 male
and 10 female) participated. All results showed 100% agreement.

C 1,000,000 0 59 0 59 100
Total 59 118 0 177 100
II. A High Dose Hook Effect study was conducted to assess whether the
Sperm Check Vasectomy test would give false negative results with very
high concentrations of sperm due to the hook effect, and semen samples of
various sperm concentrations of up to 253 million sperm/mL were tested.
The results were read by an optical density reader. The signal intensity
increased as the sperm concentration increased and no signal reduction
was observed. In a separate study, a clinical sample with a sperm
concentration of 387 million sperm/mL was tested and the test result
showed a very strong positive signal. A false negative result due to the
hook effect was not observed with this very high sperm concentration.
