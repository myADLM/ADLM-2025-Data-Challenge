K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): N/A
L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on the decrease of the transmitted light caused by the aggregates
which form when a patient plasma containing D-Dimer is mixed with latex particles
coated with monoclonal antibody. The degree of agglutination is directly
proportional to the concentration of D-Dimer in the sample.

suspected DVT or PE using representative IL Coagulation Systems: ACL
TOP and ACL ELITE instruments. The ACL TOP represents the linear
analyzer group (ACL TOP, ACL Advance/Futura), the ACL ELITE
represents the centrifugal group (ACL 8/9/10000/Elite/ElitePro, ACL 100-
7000 Series).
The Wells model was used to assess PTP (pre-test probability) score. The
patients were classified as having a low, moderate, or high probability of DVT
or PE.
• Patients with a negative D-Dimer test result and a low PTP score
underwent no further diagnostic testing and were followed-up after 3
months for development of DVT or PE.
• For patients with a negative D-Dimer test result and a moderate PTP, it
was the physician’s decision whether to follow-up after 3 months or to
undergo imaging techniques. Data indicated that all patients with a
negative D-Dimer test and a moderate PTP received either 3 months of
follow-up, or imaging with 3 months of follow-up if the imaging result
was negative.
• Patients with a positive D-Dimer test result or a high PTP score were
imaged. Data indicated that all patients received 3 months of follow-
up if the imaging result was negative.
• As of the 3 month follow-up, none of the patients that were negative
through D-Dimer testing and imaging had developed DVT or PE.
• Through imaging techniques, one patient with a negative D-Dimer test
result on the ACL ELITE and a moderate PTP score was confirmed for
PE.
Previously established clinical cut-off of 230 ng/mL for HemosIL D-Dimer
(K050278) was used for calculation. Statistical evaluation of the respective
data sets from the four sites was performed using analysis of variance
(ANOVA) to verify whether the three PE sites could be pooled and the three
DVT sites could be pooled. The results were within acceptable limit (p>0.05).
ACL TOP: 302 patients were suspected of DVT and 330 patients were
suspected of PE.
• DVT samples: Of the 302 total DVT suspected patients (175 females,
127 males). The overall prevalence of DVT in the total population of
samples was 19.5% (59/302).
• PE samples: Of 330 total PE suspected patients (188 females, 142
males). The overall prevalence of PE in the total population of samples
was 15.2% (50/330).
