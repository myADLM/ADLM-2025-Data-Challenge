L. Test Principle:
The Creatinine Assay is based on an enzymatic reaction. In TAPS buffer creatinine is
hydrolyzed by creatininase to creatine, which is than hydrolyzed by creatinase to
sarcosine. Sarcosine oxidase hydrolyzes sarcosine to glycine, formaldehyde and
peroxide. During the reaction peroxide and a chromogen form a colored end product
that is proportional to the amount of creatinine in the sample and is measured at 510
and 700 nm using a bichromatic end point.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility studies were conducted by testing two levels of a
commercially available control, serum pool and a urine pool. The samples
were run in duplicate, twice a day for twenty days using one lot and one
instrument. The results are presented in the table below:

Control Level 2 164.90 1.97 1.2 4.68 2.8
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range of the assay is 0.3 -20 mg/dL. The urine measuring range
goes to 200 mg/dL due to the dilution 1:10 of the sample before it is analyzed.
The range is based on linearity, detection limit and method comparison.
Linearity across the assay range was confirmed for serum samples by inter
diluting a sample spiked (high sample) with anhydrous creatinine with a
sample having a low endogenous creatinine to create seven additional
samples. The Chem I calibrator was used as the zero sample. A high urine
sample was made by spiking it with anhydrous creatinine. Additional samples
were made by diluting the high sample with deionized water to create six
additional samples. Deionized water was used as the zero sample. Five
determinations of each pool were tested and a linear regression analysis was
performed by the method of least squares. The instrument generates a flag
which states “Above Assay Range” or "Below Assay Range". In addition to
this, automatic dilutions are performed by the instrument for results that fall
outside the assay range. Automatic dilutions are defined in the method
parameters and cannot be changed by an operator. The results are presented
below:

replicates/day, for each sample. The testing was split between two instruments
and lots of reagents. The detection limit is 0.3 mg/dL Creatinine
