L. Test Principle:
The eQ-PCR™ LC Warfarin Genotyping Assay uses real time PCR technology to
amplify and detect the target DNA. The extracted DNA sample is mixed with a PCR
Mix, and an eQ-PCR™ specific Probe Mix reagent containing specific primers and
fluorescent labeled probes for the CYP2C9 and/or VKORC1 gene polymorphisms.
Amplification and detection are then performed in the Roche Diagnostics
LightCycler® Real-Time PCR System instrument model 1.2 using conditions defined
in the specific eQ- PCR™ LC Warfarin Genotyping Kit labeling. After the PCR
reaction is completed, the LightCycler System automatically proceeds to the melting
curve-based detection method. The signal detection is based on fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET) technology. Two probes are designed for each SNP

and labeled with different fluorophores. The anchor probe selectively hybridizes to the
sequence flanking the SNP site, and the SNP detection probe recognizes the SNP and
hybridizes to the sequence containing the SNP site. During FRET, the fluorophore on
the anchor probe is excited by the light source of the LightCycler and the excitation
energy is transferred to the fluorophore on the SNP detection probe. The emitted
fluorescence is then measured at the respective wavelength.
The SNP detection is performed by melting curve analysis, a method that discriminates
different allelic forms of DNA by melting temperature. The SNP detection probe is
designed to have a unique melting temperature to the wild type and mutant SNP. With
change in temperature, the probe dissociates from the target sequence at a specific
melting temperature depending on the allelic composition of SNP. The SNP type is
then detected based on the melting curve specific to each SNP.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To evaluate the within-laboratory, between operator, and between laboratory
reproducibility of the eQ-PCR™ LC Warfarin Genotyping Kit on the Roche
LightCycler®, three sites (two external and the sponsor’s laboratory) and five operators
participated. A panel of 31samples was tested at each of the three sites on each of five
days. At the two external sites, two operators per site performed the testing on alternate
days. The panel consisted of whole blood (WB) samples collected in EDTA from 20
donors, and 9 genomic DNA samples (cctl below). These samples represented all the
genotypes tested by this device. Each site used a different DNA extraction method for
isolating DNA from whole blood samples. Each site then tested the resulting extracted
nucleic acids using the eQ-PCR™ LC Warfarin Genotyping Kit on the Roche
LightCycler®. Genotypes for each sample were determined by bi-directional
sequencing and compared with the results from the device.
The composition of the reproducibility panel with the call rate for all three sites
combined for each sample is described in Table below. There were 6 no calls, but no
incorrect calls reported. The entire study produced a correct call rate of 98.7%.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor conducted stability studies for DNA stored at -20oC and 2-8oC using 9
commercially available genomic DNA samples with 3 lots of the reagent kit. Stability
studies for DNA stored at -20oC were conducted up to one year at 3-month intervals
and for DNA stored at -2-8oC for 30 days. Results demonstrated consistent accurate
results. The sponsor is continuing the stability studies for DNA stored at -20oC studies
for 2 yrs. However, the sponsor recommends using DNA from fresh whole blood
samples for genotyping assay.
Reagents for the Warfarin Genotyping Kit are shipped to the user laboratory on dry ice.
The sponsor recommends storing all reagents at –20oC in dark. The kit is stable at -
20oC for one year. After first use, all reagents should be stored at 2-8oC in dark. The
sponsor states that under these conditions, reagents are suitable for use up to three
months.
Controls: The sponsor does not provide positive or negative controls to be used with
this assay. However, the sponsor has recommended that a positive (heterozygous and/or
homozygous for the three genotypes) sample for each variant, a negative control (a sample
that does not contain the mutation of interest, i.e., a wild type sample); and a “Non-
Template Control” be included with each test run. All quality control requirements and
testing should be performed in conformance with local, state and/or federal regulations.
The sponsor conducted preliminary studies to establish the Melting Temperature (Tm)
cut-off values to identify the presence of individual SNP positions by the eQ-PCR™
LC Warfarin Genotyping Kit. A total of 64 individual samples were tested to evaluate
the melting temperature Cut-Off value for each SNP type. The average melting
temperature for each SNP was calculated and the Cut–Off value was determined based
on Average value ± 3 SD. The SNP result for each sample was confirmed by bi-
directional sequencing. Results are listed in the table below.

d. Limit of Detection:
A study was conducted at the sponsor’s facility to validate the recommended amounts
of DNA required for genotyping test using eQ-PCR™ LC Warfarin Genotyping test.
Six human genomic DNA samples at 7 different concentrations to obtain 0.1, 1, 10, 50,
100, 200 and 600 ng in the final reaction tube were used and 26 repeats conducted for
each test level (total of 3312 tests). These six genomic DNA samples covered all 9
possible 2C9*2, 2C9*3, and VKORC-1 genotypes. Two of the six human genomic
DNA samples were tested in two additional concentrations (300 ng & 400 ng) and
repeated three times. Based on the results, there were two “no calls” at 0.1 ng DNA.
The results of DNA limitation study are given in the tables below. For eQ-PCR™ LC
Warfarin Genotyping assay, the sponsor recommends using a total of 50 – 200 ng
genomic DNA in the final reaction tube.

e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor conducted studies to demonstrate the interference of albumin (5 mg/ml),
bilirubin (10 uM), triglycerides (4 mg/ml), heparin (14 U/ml), hemoglobin (80 mg/ml),
magnesium chloride (6 mM), and lithium chloride (9 mM) and excess of extraction
buffers on eQ-PCR assay. Nine blood samples covering all of the genotypes under
evaluation were included. An aliquot of each sample was spiked with the above
interfering substances and the results compared against the sample aliquot with no
substance. The tests were repeated 6 times for each sample. The test results indicated
no interference from above substances at the concentration levels tested and call rates
remained unaffected.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor conducted initial method comparison studies at 3 sites to demonstrate the
accuracy of the device in comparison to bi-directional sequencing. This study included
whole blood samples collected in EDTA from 150 donors. DNA was extracted at the
sponsor’s facility and aliquots of 50 unique DNA samples distributed to 3 sites (two
external and the sponsor’s facility) that participated in the study. The studies on the 150

samples resulted in 3 no-calls and 2 incorrect calls The sponsor’s study using 150
samples did not cover *3/*3 variant genotypes tested by the device. Therefore, the
sponsor conducted a second study that included 2 additional *3/*3 samples.
Genotyping results confirmed *3/*3 variant genotype for one of the samples, while the
other new sample gave an incorrect genotype call of wt//*2,*3/*3 for the 2C9 gene. The
sponsor performed a third study that included 7 new samples (4 *3/*3 and 3 *2/*2
samples). There were no incorrect calls or no-calls reported in this third study.
