L. Test Principle:
The AHDL assay measures HDL cholesterol levels directly without the need for
sample pretreatment or specialized centrifugation steps, using a two reagent format.
In the first reaction, chylomicrons, VLDL and LDL form water soluble complexes
with dextran sulfate in the presence of magnesium sulfate. These complexes are
resistant to the polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified cholesterol esterase and
cholesterol oxidase that react with HDL cholesterol. In the presence of oxygen, the
HDL cholesterol is oxidized to Δ4-cholestenone and hydrogen peroxide. The
generated hydrogen peroxide then reacts with 4-aminoantipyrine and sodium N-(2-
hydroxy-3-sulfopropyl)-3,5-dimethoxyaniline (HSDA) in the presence of peroxidase
to form a colored dye that is measured using a bichromatic (600/700 nm) endpoint
technique. The color intensity of the dye is directly proportional to the serum HDL-C
concentration.

single test from two independent cups was analyzed twice per day.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The Dimension AHDL method demonstrated visual and statistical linearity
across the claimed assay range of 3 to 150 mg/dL. The Dimension AHDL
method is linear up to and above the level 3 calibrator (>150 mg/dL).
Linearity was evaluated by comparing observed versus expected values
obtained with the Dimension® AHDL method using a series of samples. The
samples were prepared by taking the high level calibrator diluted across the
expected range with the zero level calibrator.

d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection: 3 mg/dL
The limit of detection represents the lowest concentration of high density
lipoprotein cholesterol that can be detected with at least 95% probability.
CLSI/NCCLS EP17-A, Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection
and Limits of Quantitation, was followed using 60 replicate determinations at
two concentration levels to determine the Limit of Detection.
e. Analytical specificity:
The AHDL method was evaluated for interference according to CLSI EP7-
A2.
Bias was defined as the difference in the results between the control sample
(without the interferent) and the test sample (contains the interferent)
expressed in percent. Bias exceeding 10% was considered interference.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison testing was conducted following CLSI Approved
Guideline for Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient
Samples; EP9-A2. A total of 134 serum samples were analyzed in parallel for
new AHDL and current AHDL on a Dimension ® clinical chemistry analyzer.
Seven of the 134 samples were prepared by adding concentrated high density
lipoprotein from human serum into normal human serum.
Data were analyzed by least squares linear regression analysis. A subset of
the samples with HDL-C concentrations < 60 mg/dL was also analyzed
separately.
