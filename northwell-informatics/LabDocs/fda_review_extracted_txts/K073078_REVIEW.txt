‘Rapid Tox Cup’ is intended for professional use. It is not intended for over-the-
counter sale to non-professionals. This assay is a simplified screening method
that provides only a preliminary result for use in determining the need for
additional or confirmatory testing, i.e. gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry
(GC/MS).
The barbiturate BAR, benzodiazepine BZO and tricyclic antidepressant TCA will
yield preliminary positive results when BAR, BZO, and TCA is ingested at or
above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly recognized drug levels for
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, or tricyclic antidepressant in urine.
‘Rapid Tox Cup’ provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more
specific alternate method must be used in order to obtain a more confirmed
analytical result. GC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical
and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse result,
particularly when preliminary positive results are used.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

L. Test Principle:
The immunoassays employed in each test strip of the ‘Rapid Tox Cup’ are based on
the reaction between antigens and antibodies. Each assay consists of a membrane
strip onto which up to five different drug conjugates have been immobilized. A
colloidal gold-antibody complex consisting of up to five antibodies is dried at one end
of the membrane. In the absence of any drug in the urine sample, the colloidal gold-
multi-antibody complex moves with the urine sample by capillary action to contact
the immobilized drug conjugate. Antibody-antigen reactions occur forming a visible
line in all “test” areas. The formation of a visible line in the test areas occur when the
test is negative for the adjacent labeled drug. When drug is present in the urine
sample, the drug or metabolite will compete with the immobilized drug conjugate in
the test area for the limited antibody binding sites on the colloidal gold-labeled
antibody complex, thus preventing attachment of the labeled antibody to the drug
conjugate. An absence of a color line in any of the test areas is indicative of a
positive result. A control line, comprised of a different antibody/antigen reaction, is
present on the membrane strip. The control line is not influenced by the presence or
absence of a drug in the urine, and therefore, should be present in all reactions.
Negative urine will produce up to six colored lines, and a positive sample will
produce a colored line in the control area and no colored line(s) in the test area
corresponding to the individual analyte(s) that are present in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was evaluated using commercially available control materials.
Each sample, at each concentrations of each drug, was tested 4 times a day,
twice a day for 5 days. A total of 40 determinations, at each concentration,
were made.

Not applicable. The assay is for qualitative use.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device has internal process controls. A colored line appearing in the
control region confirms that sufficient sample volume has been applied and
that the sample has migrated correctly on the test strip. Users are informed
that the test is invalid if a line fails to appear in the control region. External
controls are not supplied with this device.

e. Analytical specificity:
The Rapid Tox Cup was evaluated for interference. A high concentration
stock solution of each analyte was serially diluted (1:1) until negative results
were obtained. The lowest concentrations that gave positive results are listed

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical urine specimens were obtained from a reference laboratory and tested
using the Rapid Tox Cup, Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS),
HPLC for tricyclics antidepressant and LC/MS for buprenorphine. Butalbital,
phenobarbital, and pentobarbital samples were evaulated for barbiturates.
Alprazolam, oxazepam, lorazepam, nordiazepam, and temazepam samples
were evaluated for benzodiazepines. Amitriptyline, nortriptyline, imipramine
and desipramine samples were included in the tricyclic antidepressant
analysis. Buprenorphine samples were tested via an enzymatic hydrolysis
method, followed by centrifugation and direct analysis of the total
buprenorphine concentration.
