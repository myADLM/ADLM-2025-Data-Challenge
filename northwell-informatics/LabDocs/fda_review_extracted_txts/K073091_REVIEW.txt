L. Test Principle:
The VIDAS® NT-proBNP Assay is one-step, sandwich enzyme-linked fluorescent
immunoassay (ELFA) performed with an automated VIDAS or a miniVIDAS
instrument. A pipette tip-like disposable device, the Solid Phase Receptacle (SPR),
serves as the solid phase as well as a pipettor for the assay. Reagents for the assay are
pre-dispensed in the sealed PBNP Reagent Strips.
All assay steps and assay temperatures are controlled by the instrument. The sample
is transferred into the wells containing the conjugate (alkaline phosphatase-labeled
sheep polyclonal NT-proBNP antibody). The sample and conjugate mixture is cycled
in and out of the SPR several times. Unbound sample is removed from the SPR
during the wash step. During the detection step, the fluorescent substrate (4-Methyl-
umberlliferyl phosphate) is cycled in and out of the SPR. The conjugate enzyme
remaining in the SPR catalyzes the hydrolysis of the substrate into a fluorescent
product 4-methylumbellferone. Fluorescence is measured at 450 nm wavelength by
the optical scanner in the instrument. The intensity of the fluorescence is directly
proportional to the concentration of analyte present in the sample.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was performed over 10 days using five samples covering
the measurement range (116.58, 508.55, 1407.06, 7,126.53, 14,528.62)
assayed in duplicate in 40 different runs (2 runs per day) with two reagent lots
using the same VIDAS instrument at three different sites—2 European and 1
US. Each site performed modified randomized precision studies following
CLSI EP5-A2 Guidelines. 80 values per sample were generated per site
(n=240 values for each sample). The results presented below were evaluated
for the following: repeatability, between-run within-day precision, between-
day within-site precision, between-site within-lot precision, and lot-to-lot
precision.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range is 20-25,000 pg/mL. 2 samples were tested for linearity.
One sample was a high pool (28,459 pg/mL) and the other was a lower pool
(1583 pg/mL). Each pool was diluted 13 times using the reagent kit diluent,
and a pool of human samples mixed with other samples in variable
proportions to cover the measurement range down to 30 pg/mL. Samples
were assayed in duplicate. 30 pg/mL was the lowest concentration obtainable
because the diluent is composed of human serum pool with preservatives so
there is always some NT-proBNP present. The percent deviation from
linearity was 10%.
Recovery studies were performed on samples with NT-proBNP concentrations
of 70-24,400 pg/mL. Recoveries ranged from 86.9.0% to 112.9%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

using a modification of ISO 17511.
Stability
The calibrators and controls are lyophilized and are stable for 12 months when
stored at 2-8°C. After reconstitution, they are stable for up to 8 hours at 2-8°C
or up to the expiration date of the kit when stored at -25±6°C. Calibrators and
controls may be frozen and thawed up to 6 times.
The stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
Four samples were analyzed over a period of 4 days on one instrument using
one lot of reagents. They consisted of 2 standards, a blank containing no NT-
proBNP, and a high standard with a concentration of 51.8 pg/mL of NT-
proBNP. Two low level samples with values of 13.64 pg/mL and 14.16
pg/mL were also analyzed.
Limit of Blank (LoB) was defined as corresponding to the 95th percentile of
blank signal values. 6 replicates were assayed 10 times for n=60. Based on
the sponsor’s analysis and acceptance criteria, the LoB = 3.4 pg/mL.
Limit of Detection (LoD) was defined as the concentration corresponding to
the signals from the two low level samples along a curve drawn between the
blank and the high standard, rounded to the upper value. 2 replicates of each
sample were assayed 15 times for a total of 30 measurements per sample
(n=60). The LoD signal for the two samples was calculated using the formula
LoD = LoB signal + c SDs where the SDs are the estimated pooled standard
β
deviation of the low level sample signals and c is derived from the 95th
β
percentile of the standard Gaussian distribution and corrected for degrees of
freedom of the estimated standard deviations. Based on the sponsor’s analysis
6

--- Page 7 ---
and acceptance criteria, the LoD = 6.7 pg/mL. The sponsor claims a limit of
detection of < 20 pg/mL.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was defined as the lowest concentration that can
be measured with an inter-assay CVof 20%. Twelve samples ranging from 10
to 39 pg/mLwere tested in duplicate on one instrument for 9 days over a
period of 15 days. The value obtained for LoQ was 21.9 pg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity (cross-reactivity) was evaluated by spiking each cross-
reactant into serums containing target concentrations of 0, 255, 1483 pg/mL
NT-proBNP. A control for each cross-reactant was prepared by spiking the
samples with the same volume of the solvent used for reconstituting the cross-
reactant. The cross-reactant test samples and the control samples were
measured on the VIDAS and the cross-reactivity was calculated. Acceptance
criteria was the percent of cross-reactivity must be < 0.1% for all samples,
interference ratios are within 99.8% confidence interval (CI) for the within lot
precision profile. The following compounds do not cross-react.

Hemoglobin, Bilirubin, Triglycerides
Samples containing approximately 24, 325, 3600 and 14,500 pg/mL NT pro-
BNP were spiked with the appropriate concentration of the test substance.
NT-proBNP recovery of the sample was compared to that of a control sample.
Hemoglobin up to 300 micM (485 g/dL), bilirubin up to 510 micM (29
mg/dL), and triglycerides up to 30 g/L did not interfere with the test. As a
further precaution, the device labeling recommends that samples appearing
hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic not be used and that, if possible, a new sample
be collected.
HSA, IgG, IgM, rheumatoid factors, anti-ALP and dialysis samples
Recovery studies were performed to determine interference from HSA, IgG,
IgM, RF, anti-ALP and dialysis. A NT-proBNP positive sample (1278.6-
1585.8 pg/mL) and a NT-proBNP negative sample (<20-39.8 pg/mL) were
used for the studies. There was no IgG, or IgM interference at 1.7 g/dL and
0.6 g/dL respectively.
HSA was evaluated at three doses, 10.5 g/dL, 14.5 g/dL and 19.5 g/dL in the
negative and positive NT-proBNP samples. The negative NT-proBNP sample
showed interference at the 10.5 g/dL dose of HSA. There was no interference
in the positive NT-proBNP sample.
Recovery studies were performed for rheumatoid factor-positive samples,
dialysis samples and anti-alkaline phosphatase samples using positive and
negative NT-proBNP samples. Dialysis and the anti-alkaline phosphatase
(ant-ALP) samples were evaluated by spiking them with known
concentrations of the positive and negative NT-proBNP samples from above.
These were compared to a “reference sample” composed of a mixture of the
positive and negative NT-proBNP samples.
Interferent Interferent dose range Recovery range of all
samples
Rheumatoid factor 40 IU/mL-1,560 IU/mL 84.6%-101.9%
Dialysis NA 88.2%-102.1%
Anti-ALP NA 88.4%-94.4%
Drug Interference
The effect of 39 frequently administered drugs was tested in vitro. No
interference was observed.
f. Assay cut-off:
Assay cutoffs were established based on the Roche Elecsys proBNP assay
which the VIDAS assay claims traceable to.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
713 clinical samples from 3 sites were analyzed on the VIDAS and the
predicate device, Roche Elecsys across the measurement range of 20-25,000
pg/mL. For method comparison against the predicate, 104 samples were
included although they had values <20 pg/mL or were beyond the
measurement range and had to be diluted. 224 samples were from a
biochemical laboratory in Europe (Site 1), 203 samples from a European
hospital (Site 2) and 182 samples from a medical center in the USA (Site 3).
Slope = 0.905 and intercept = -14.599 for the combined sites met the
sponsor’s acceptance criteria of 95% confidence interval (slope 0.896-0.915,
intercept -19.031 – -12.120). r = 0.989.
Total concordance between the VIDAS and the predicate using the 713
clinical samples at the cutoffs of 125 pg/mL for subjects < 75 years old and
450 pg/mL for subjects > 75 years old are shown in the table below.

interval.
Negative Percent Agreement = 97.12% (95.29%-98.38%)
Positive Percent Agreement = 99.48% (97.15%-99.99)
Overall Agreement = 97.76% (96.38%-98.71%)
b. Matrix comparison:
In order to demonstrate equivalence between serum and plasma, three
different tube types, gel separator, EDTA, and lithium heparin, were
compared to a plain tube (no anticoagulants or gel). Two manufacturers’
products were used. 63 patient samples were collected. Samples were native
and spiked to cover the entire measurement range (<20-24,499.2 pg/mL).

Results were compared to those of the plain tube. Passing and Bablock
regression data of lithium heparin plasma and gel separator tubes to the plain
tubes had slopes of 0.98 and1.00, intercepts of -2.2 and 7.2 respectively. The
sponsor’s acceptance criteria were: slope 0.9-1.1, intercept < 20 pg/mL, CV >
0.95. Based on these studies it was determined that the gel separator (serum)
or lithium heparin were appropriate preservatives. EDTA showed
nonconformity and is not recommended for use in the labeling.
3. Clinical studies:
Clinical studies were performed at 3 sites, 2 European and 1 US, which
represented 407 samples with confirmed congestive heart failure (CHF). 147
samples were from European Site 1, 139 samples were from European Site 2, and
119 were from the US Site. The reference group consisted of 411 samples from
prospective subjects that presented to the Emergency Department or Clinical
Investigation Center at a European site with neither a history of CHF nor cardiac
nor circulatory diseases. Sensitivities, specificities and positive and negative
predictive values are shown with the 95% CI and are broken down by site, age
and gender.

the VIDAS assay is traceable to. Recommended clinical thresholds are 125 pg/mL
for patients younger than 75 years and 450 pg/mL for patients 75 years and older.
Since the incidence of CHF increases with age, age matched Receiver Operator
Curves (ROC) were calculated for each stratification: <45, 45-54, 55-64, 65-75
and ≥ 75 years old. The optimum cut-off maximizes the area under the curve
(AUC) and represents the highest sensitivity and specificity for the assay. The
overall area under the curve (AUC) for the VIDAS NT-proBNP assay was 0.965.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Assay cutoffs were established based on the Roche Elecsys proBNP assay which
the VIDAS assay is traceable to.
125 pg/mL for < 75 years old
450 pg/mL for > 75 years old
Results were stratified by age groups and genders. Patients with results < 20
pg/mL were not included in the mean and standard deviation calculations.
