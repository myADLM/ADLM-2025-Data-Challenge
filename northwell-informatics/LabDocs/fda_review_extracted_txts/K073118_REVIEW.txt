I. Device Description:
The Prodigy Voice Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of blood glucose
meter, blood glucose test strips, control solutions, the lancing device, and lancets. The
meter also comes with a speaker function to help visually impaired individuals
perform a test. The meter was previously cleared under k060467 with the
measurement function the same, but has a different appearance. The Prodigy Voice
Blood Glucose Monitoring System allows more alternate sites (forearm, upper arm,
calf and thigh) for blood glucose testing than cleared under k063212 (palm) and its
use is by visually impaired individuals.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The applicant states that the guidelines, ISO 15197 and CLSI - EP9-A were
followed in this study to assess visual impaired use.
One hundred and thirteen subjects who are visually impaired patients as
defined in ICD-9 of Word Health Organization were involved in this study.
They were given Prodigy Voice meters that contain speaking function which
guide glucose testing step-by-step in English. The lay-users ranged in age,
education and were equally divided between males and females. 74% of the
participants were defined as having low vision while 26% were defined as
having blindness.
Test results were compared to those obtained from trained health professionals
performing glucose test on above subjects. The following regression plot was
used to assess the clinical significance of error in the blood glucose
monitoring results.
N=113, range = 41-461 mg/dL
y = 0.9881x + 0.6231, R2 = 0.984

97% (110/113) of the individual difference were within ± 15mg/dL when
glucose concentrations are less than 75mg/dL and were within ± 20% when
glucose concentrations are •75mg/dL, meeting ISO 15197 criteria.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not Applicable
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not Applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not Applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
A study using ISO 15197 and CLSI - EP9-A as guidance was conducted to
evaluate user error, comfort and ease of use of Prodigy Voice BGM System
test strip for blood glucose monitoring using the palm, the forearm, the upper
arm, the calf and the thigh as an alternative sampling sites. Participants, who
are able to read manual in English, were instructed to read the user manual
and perform testing on the finger and AST sites. Testing using samples from
alternative sites was immediately followed by finger-stick blood testing by the
participants.
The following regression analysis was used to assess the clinical significance
of error in the blood glucose monitoring results.

readings.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied

Time of day	People without diabetes
Fasting and before meals	Less than 110 mg/dL
2 hours after meals	Less than 140 mg/dL

--- Page 9 ---
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip,
palm, forearm, upper-arm, calf and thigh. Since the whole blood sample is applied
directly to the test strip there are no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
Rather than the user inputting a new calibration code for each lot of strips, the
calibration is factory set by the manufacturer.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor provides one level of the Prodigy Control Solution. The other two
levels of control may be purchased separately. To perform a control test the user
is instructed to press the M button after the blood drop has appeared on the
display. This prevents control results from being stored in the internal memory.
The acceptable range for each level is printed on the test strip vial label. If control
results fall outside these ranges, the user is referred to a list of troubleshooting
steps and the customer care line
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In

Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
