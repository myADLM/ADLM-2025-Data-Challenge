L. Test Principle:
Glucose measurement is based on electrical potential caused by the reaction of glucose with
the reagents contained on the strip’s electrodes. The glucose in the sample is oxidized by the
enzyme glucose oxidase, and the current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured
and converted to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is
proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated the within run precision of the device using 20 replicate
measurements of 5 concentrations of glucose-adjusted venous whole blood and 2
concentrations of control solutions with 3 strip lots.
The sponsor also evaluated the between run precision of the device using replicate
measurements of venous whole blood samples and glucose controls. Twenty
replicates at 5 different concentrations and 2 levels of controls were each tested with
3 strip lots over 20 days. Results met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of a standard
deviation ≤ 4.5 mg/dL when the glucose concentration was <75 mg/dL and less than a
6% CV for glucose concentrations ≥ 75 mg/dL. Results are summarized in the table
below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To establish the linearity of the GlucoSure Voice Meter system through the range of
20 to 600 mg/dL glucose adjusted whole blood samples were compared to YSI 2300.
The sponsor tested 8 samples that spanned the claimed measuring range 4 times using
10 different meters and 3 different strip lots. Linear regression yields the following
statistics:

--- Page 5 ---
Slope y-intercept r2
Strip Lot 1 1.055 -7.128 0.998
Strip Lot 2 1.033 -4.587 0.999
Strip Lot 3 1.049 -7.152 0.998
The sponsor claims 20 mg/dL as the lowest detectable limit in the labeling.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The controls were evaluated in the predicate device (k062799). The evaluation of the
controls in that submission is described below.
The device is traceable to a laboratory analyzer which is calibrated to a glucose
standard (NIST SRM 965a).
Stability characteristics of both levels of control solutions were determined using real
time aging studies to determine the open vial storage stability at room temperature to
be 18 months and unopened vial stability to be 24 months.
The expected values for the two glucose control solutions were established by repeat
testing (10 times) on two meters using one lot of strips for both glucose levels. The
expected results may change with each new lot, but the control range is listed in the
product insert.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the GlucoSure Voice Blood Glucose Monitoring System is
20 - 600 mg/dL. This range was verified by the linearity study (above).
e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity was evaluated in the predicate device (k062799).
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A consumer study was performed with 152 lay-users and a technician (with 6 samples
contrived to produce low sample values) to see if glucose readings from the fingertip
were comparable to a laboratory glucose reference method and that alternate site
testing were comparable to fingertip. The labeling provided to the users was in
English only. Each participant performed their own fingerstick and tested their blood
using the instructions in the user’s manual. The 6 contrived samples ranged from
34.3 - 47.6 mg/dL and the real samples ranged from 48.8 – 478 mg/dL. Results are
summarized below using a single finger stick values (where the labeling uses a mean
fingerstick value of two results):

The above studies were performed by lay users that were both normally sited and
visually impaired (having severe presbyopia, retinopathy, cataracts, or glaucoma)
who used the voice feature.
The sponsor showed the performance of the device by only the visually impaired
users by evaluating those users blood glucose and comparing them to YSI as well as a
user study to determine if the voice feature was satisfactory to users. The
concentration of the samples ranged from 48.8 to 478 mg/dL. The results are

2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ______
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm, or
forearm only. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are
no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
7

--- Page 8 ---
A code number is provided with each batch of test strips to calibrate the meter for that
batch. The code number is associated with the meter by a coding card that is inserted into
the meter that comes with each vial of test strips. No further calibrations are required of
the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor is providing a single level glucose control solution with this device as a
“starter kit.” There is a “simple kit” in which controls are not provided. Two levels are
available for purchase as stated in the labeling. When a test strip is inserted into the
meter, a control can be run. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the
test strip vial label. The user is referred to a troubleshooting section of the owner’s
manual to identify possible reasons control results fall outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
None
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
