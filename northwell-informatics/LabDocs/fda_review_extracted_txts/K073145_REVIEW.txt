L. Test Principle:
Native human tissue transglutaminase is bound to the wells of a polystyrene
microwell plate under conditions that will preserve the antigen in its native state. Pre-
diluted controls and diluted patient sera are added to separate wells, allowing any h-
tTG IgA or IgG antibodies present to bind to the immobilized antigen. Unbound
sample is washed away and an enzyme labeled anti-human IgA and IgG conjugate is
added to each well. A second incubation allows the enzyme labeled anti-human IgA
and IgG to bind to any patient antibodies, which have become attached to the
microwells. After washing away any unbound enzyme labeled anti-human IgA and
IgG, the remaining enzyme activity is measured by adding a chromogenic substrate
and measuring the intensity of the color that develops. The assay can be evaluated
spectrophotometrically by measuring and comparing the color intensity that develops
in the patient wells with the color in the control wells

The intra-assay precision was determined by testing nine serum samples five
times on one kit lot by one operator. Results showed that 4 samples with high
anti-h-tTG concentrations (32.6-46.8 units) had %CV of 1.2-7.7%, 3 samples
close to the cut-off (18.3-22.3 units) had % CV of 2.1-5.8% and 2 negative
samples (7.7-13.5 units) had %CV of 5.6-7.2% (see table below).

The inter-assay precision was determined by testing twelve serum samples in
duplicate six times for five days on one kit lot by one operator. Results
showed that 5 samples with high anti-h-tTG concentrations (31.3-49.3 units)
had %CV of 2.2-9.3%, 3 samples close to the cut-off (16.0-23.0 units) had %
CV of 4.8-11.3% and 4 negative samples (5.2-14.5units) had %CV of 6.1-
18.4% (see table below).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There are no reference standards for htTG. The positive and negative controls
are prepared in-house and arbitrary units are assigned during the development
process.
Stability: The expiration date claim is one year for the QUANTA LiteTM h-
tTG Screen.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference by endogenous substances: No data provided. The package insert
states that grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, icteric, microbially contaminated, heat-
treated samples or specimens containing visible particulate should be avoided
in this assay.
Crossreactivity with other autoantibodies: The QUANTA Lite™ h-tTG Screen
was tested with 44 sera containing other autoantibodies specific for:
Chromatin (4), Centromere (4), GBM (4), SS-B (4), RNP (5), SCL-70 (6), Jo-
1 (5), Sm (4), SS-A (4), and TPO (4). All samples were negative with the
QUANTA Lite™ h-tTG Screen with a mean value of 4.6 U/mL which is below
the 20 unit cut-off.

f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off of 20 units for the assay was established from 381 random
asymptomatic healthy individuals residing in the United States. Age and
gender were available for 269 samples and unavailable for the remaining 112
samples. The age ranges were 14-76 years and included 141 male subjects
and 128 female subjects. The assay specificity was 97.9% (373/381). The
mean value of 381 samples was 8.6 units. The standard deviation (SD) of the
samples was 4.4 units. The mean value was 2.5SDs below the cut-off value of
20 units. Of the 8 positive samples, six were weak positive with values from
20.3 – 28.4 units; one moderate positive value was 32.4 units and one strong
positive value was 54.9 units which was believed to be from a true celiac
patient based on a positive IgA anti-h-tTG result of 72.4 units.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Testing was performed on 125 samples from four celiac disease reference labs
and 81 normal samples. The Positive Percent Agreement was 100.0%
(52/52); the Negative Percent Agreement was 97.1% (451/454) and the
Overall Agreement was 97.4% (493/506).
