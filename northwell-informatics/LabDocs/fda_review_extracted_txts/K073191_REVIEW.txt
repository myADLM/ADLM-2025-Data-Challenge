Magnesium acetate (2.0 mmol/l), Zinc sulphate (0.5 mmol/l), HEDTA (2.5
mmol/l) and NaN3 (< 0.1 %).
Reagent B contains p-Nitrophenylphosphate (80 mmol/l) and NaN (< 0.1 %).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was tested on serum samples. The samples were diluted in 11 steps
by mixing samples with each other 1:1. For example, the 50% sample resulted
from a 1:1 mixture of the 100% and 0% samples. Four parallel measurements
were made in random order for each step using one reagent lot. Eleven
samples tested ranging in concentration from 9.4 U/l to 1215 U/L.
For the extended range linearity study another set of samples were prepared
and measured as above with the exception that the samples S5 – S11 were run
using an additional secondary dilution Eleven samples were tested ranging in
.
concentration from 48.8 U/l to 11329.7 U/L.
Samples:
Low level: serum pool diluted with 0.9% NaCl while for high level: serum
pool was spiked with commercially available alkaline phosphatase of
placental origin.
Results Obtained:
For Linearity (n=11): Slope = 0.988, Intercept = 0.3702 Obs. Err = 2.7%
For Ext. Linearity (n=11) Slope = 0.975, Intercept = -1.26, Obs. Err = 5.1%
The data supported the claimed measuring range of 20 – 1000 U/L, and
extended measuring range 20 – 10 000 U/l.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Alkaline Phosphatase (IFCC) Plus method is traceable to the molar
absorbance coefficient of p-nitrophenol.
The sponsor’s protocols indicate that calibrator (eCal) is traceable to the

reference procedure given in the value sheet, which is the IFCC reference
procedure for 3-reagent method and molar absorbance coefficient of NADH
for 1-reagent method. The controls (Nortrol and Abtrol) are traceable to the
IFCC procedure. The values are lot-specific and are assigned based on
multiple determinations performed using several T60 instruments. The
assigned value is the median of all the values generated for each calibrator and
control. Additionally, control range is calculated as the target value ± 2
standard deviations. Please refer to the value assignment sheet in the labeling
for lot specific values.
To ensure adequate quality control, the sponsor recommends calibrating the
test at least every three days and every time a new reagent bottle is used. The
sponsor also recommends using quality control samples at least once a day,
after each calibration and when a new bottle is used. The sponsor further
recommends that all local, state and federal guidelines be followed.
The sponsor claims that all open on-board stability for reagents is 14 days.
Reagent in unopened vial is stable at 2-8°C until expiration date on vial label
when protected from light.
d. Detection limit:
In the Limit of Blank (LOB) study thirty replicates of a blank sample (0.9%
NaCl) were run using two T60 instruments and two reagent lots with the total
number of measurements being 60. The results support a claimed LOB of 1
U/L.
In the Limit of Detection (LOD) study five low level samples were run in ten
replicates with two T60 instruments and two reagent lots during two days with
the total number of measurements being 100. The results support a claimed
LOD of 5 U/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference Studies: For each interfering substance (except for Lipemia,
Intralipid®) three parallel measurements of five interfering concentrations
(including non-interfered sample) were run in ascending – descending –
ascending order. To test the interference by lipemia (Intralipid®), both control
and test pools were analyzed, with four replicates from each pool, within one
analytical run. There was deemed to be no interference if the observed values
were ± 10% or ± 7.5 U/L of initial value.
Lipemia: No interference found up to 1000 mg/dl (10 g/l) of Intralipid.
Hemolysate: No interference found up to 300 mg/dl (3 g/l) of hemoglobin
Bilirubin conjugated: No interference found up to 58 mg/dl (1000 µmol/l) of
conjugated bilirubin
Bilirubin unconjugated: No interference found up to 21 mg/dl (360 μmol/l) of
unconjugated bilirubin.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable.

demonstrate the equivalence of the two systems. The samples were split in
two and then run either on the predicate or Thermo device. Each individual
measurement from the device was compared to one individual measurement
result of the predicate.
