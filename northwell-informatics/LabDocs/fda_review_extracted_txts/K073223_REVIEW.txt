L. Test Principle:
Carbon dioxide in sample reacts with PEP in the presence of PEPC and magnesium to
yield oxaloacetic acid and phosphate. In the presence of MD the reduced cofactor
absorbs strongly at 405 nm. The difference in absorbance between the final and first
reading which is measured bichromatically at 405/508 nm is directly proportional to
the carbon dioxide concentration in the sample.

Laboratories (POL) (with three trained operators typically found in these
settings) by testing three serum samples. The samples were run once a day,
three times per run for five days using one instrument at each site. The results
are presented below:

Linear regression y = 0.988x + 0.02, r2 = .9964
The reportable range of 5-43 mEq/L is based on linearity, detection limit and
method comparison.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The S Test Carbon dioxide cartridge is factory calibrated by using standard
material with an assigned value which is traceable to the NIST standard
Reference material SRM351. The 2-D barcode printed on each cartridge
provides the analyzer with lot-specific calibration data.
Real time stability studies have been conducted. Protocols and acceptance
criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims
the following expiration date:
When stored at 2-8 ºC the assay reagent is good until the expiration date.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank and Limit of Detection was determined by running a low
sample (five different samples) and a BSA sample, (7.5% in saline) for 3 days,
4 replicates/day, for each low sample and 20 replicates/day, for the true blank
sample, for a total of 60 results. The testing was split between two
instruments. The detection limit is 5.0 mEq/L CO2.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies to determine the effects of Unconjugated Bilirubin,
Hemolysis were performed using seven serum pools containing approximately
24.0 mg/dl CO2 which were spiked with varies concentrations of
unconjugated bilirubin (0-50 mg/dL), hemoglobin (0-1000 mg/dL). To test
Lipemia interference three lipemic serum samples were used.

Sponsor states that interference is considered to be significant if the analyte
result is different from the control by + 10%. There was no significant
interference from bilirubin, hemoglobin or Lipemia.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical correlation studies were performed comparing the S-Test CO2 results
generated on the S40 Clinical analyzer against the results from the ACE
Clinical analyzer using a total of 94 serum sample Of the 94 serum samples (9
were diluted and 8 were spiked samples). All the samples were measured in
singlet and only one specimen per patient was obtained.
The correlation study between the device and the predicate yielded the
following results.

Performance for the S Test Carbon Dioxide was evaluated at three Physician
Office Laboratories with a total of three operators who are typical operators at
these sites. Operators ran from 39 or more unaltered clinical serum samples
obtained from each site as well as 8 diluted and 4 spiked samples. The S Test
Carbon dioxide test results were compared to the ACE results. The correlation
study between the device and the predicate for serum yielded the following
results.

b. Matrix comparison:
A serum / plasma comparison test was performed for the S-Test CO2 assay.
Thirty-five paired samples were assayed on the S40 System. Seven of the
samples where spiked and four samples where diluted to help cover the assay
range. The correlation is as follows:
y = 0.998x – 0.40, r = 0.962, range 10-42
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Forty-five (45) normal serum samples for CO2 were evaluated on the S40 Clinical
Analyzer to determine if the reference ranges of the predicate (Ortho Clinical
Fusion) could be transferred to the new assay. The sponsors’ acceptance criterion
is 90% of the assay results for the normal samples are within the predicate range.
Analysis confirmed sufficient agreement (6.7% non-congruent results for CO2,
sponsor specification <10%) to transfer the reference range.
CO2 – 22-30 mEq/L
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
