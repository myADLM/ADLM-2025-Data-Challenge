statistical approach
L. Test Principle:
To perform a test, the test strip is inserted into the monitor. A drop of blood is applied to the
end of the strip and automatically drawn into the sample chamber. Glucose measurement is
based on electrical current caused by the reaction of glucose in the sample with the reagents
contained on the strip. The current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is proportional to
the glucose concentration in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability was assessed by assaying venous blood samples adjusted to 5 glucose
concentrations (40, 100, 130, 200 and 300 mg/dL). A total of 500 repetitions were
run on each of 2 test strip lots on 10 meters (10 repetitions per meter, per interval).
The mean, SD and %CV were calculated for each lot at each glucose level. All SD
and %CV results were within the sponsor’s acceptance limit of 5mg/dL and 5%
respectively.
Intermediate precision was assessed by assaying 200 repetitions of each of 3 levels of
control material (40, 120, and 350 mg/dL) on 2 test strip lots and 10 meters, over a
period of 11 days by 8 operators. All SD and %CV results were within the sponsor’s
acceptance limit of 5mg/dL and 5% respectively.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Unpooled venous blood collected from nine donors was adjusted to 7 glucose levels
(20, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600mg/dL). Each concentration was measured with
16 replicates on each of 2 test strip lots and run on 8 meters over a period of 3 days.
The results were as follows:
Lot 1 y = 0.02009x + 0.451, r2 = 0.999
Lot 2 y = 0.02014x +0.405, r 2 = 1.000

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor conducted a study to demonstrate equivalence between the proposed
device and the predicate (Ultra 2 System meter). A total of 400 venous whole blood
samples were adjusted to 5 glucose levels (20, 70, 240, 450, and 600 mg/dL) and
tested on 16 subject and 16 predicate devices. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria was
that the mean bias difference of the UltraLink from the Ultra 2 would be within 3
mg/dL or 4%, whichever was greater, with 95% confidence. The results were as
follows:

The sponsor also conducted a system accuracy study, comparing the UltraLink
System to the YSI 2300 Analyzer. In this study, two samples from each of 103
subjects, ranging from 47- 402 mg/dL were tested with 3 test strip lots on 12 meters
over 12 days. The results, presented in the format recommended by ISO 15197, were
as follows:
For glucose concentrations < 75 mg/dL:
within + 5 mg/dL within + 10 mg/dL within + 15 mg/dL
61% 94.4% 100%
For glucose concentrations > 75mg/dL:
within + 5% within + 10% within + 15% within + 20%
34.7 68.3 91.3 98.8
b. Matrix comparison:
The alternative sampling site performance from the palm and forearm was established
in predicate submission (k053529).
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
A lay user performance study was conducted with 93 subjects at two study sites. The
subjects were briefed on the study procedures and requirements but received no
training or instruction on the use of the UltaLink System other than copies of the
device labeling. The subjects obtained their own fingerstick samples and ran the test,
and then the healthcare professionals obtained a second fingerstick sample. The range
of samples tested was 60-398 mg/dL. The results were as follows:

Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.

A Glucose control solution at a normal concentration is provided by the sponsor and
should be used with this device. An acceptable range for the control is printed on the test
strip vial. The user is instructed to contact the Customer Help line if control results fall
outside these ranges. An additional level of control (high) is available by calling the
Customer Help line.
