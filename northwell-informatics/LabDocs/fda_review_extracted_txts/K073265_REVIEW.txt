L. Test Principle:
The nitric oxide concentration in the breath sample is measured using an optical
biosensor that changes its light absorption characteristics when exposed to nitric
oxide. The biosensor is contained in a single-use, disposable sensor cartridge.
The measurement subsystem of the Monitor measures the change in transmission of a
narrow spectrum of light through the biosensor in order to calculate the concentration
of nitric oxide in the breath sample.
The sensor cartridge controls the concentration of water vapor surrounding the
biosensor and conditions the incoming breath sample. Also, CO is removed from the
2
breath sample by the breath sample filterwith minimal impact on the nitric oxide
concentration. Solid-state thermoelectric coolers control the temperature of the sensor
cartridge to prevent temperature-induced shifts in optical absorbance.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Clinical Repeatability
Repeatability is defined as the average standard deviation of repeated
measurements on a single subject. Clinical repeatability was evaluated by
replicate testing on the Apieron INSIGHT eNO System at a single clinical site
using 3 operators. Seventy-eight asthma subjects of varying severity were
tested twice within a single measurement session. The results of this study
were analyzed in clinically significant ranges of eNO concentrations and are
provided in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was assessed using 24 samples at each of nine target NO gas
concentrations: 0 ppb, 10 ppb, 20 ppb, 50 ppb, 80 ppb, 110 ppb, 150 ppb, 200
ppb and 240 ppb. The degree of nonlinearity was computed as the percentage
deviation between the linear fit and the 3rd order nonlinear fit relative to the
target concentrations. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion was a percentage
deviation of < 5% at each of the test concentrations within the measurement
range.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The 1 ppm reference gas cylinders are “RATA” (Relative Accuracy Test
Audit) indicating that they have been analyzed according to the method
described in EPA publication (EPA-600/R-07/121). The cylinders are
analyzed directly against a NIST Standard Reference Material (SRM), a NIST
traceable Reference Material (NTRM), or a Netherlands Measurement
Institute (NMi) Primary Reference Material (PRM). The values of the
certified gas are used in the calibration of the Apieron INSIGHT™ eNO
System.
The Apieron INSIGHT™ eNO System will initially be labeled with a shelf
life (expiration date) of three months. Shelf life testing has been conducted
through real-time aging.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Detection was tested to verify that the Apieron INSIGHT eNO
System measurement technology was capable of reliably measuring eNO
concentrations at the lowest reported value of 10 ppb.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was assessed as the smallest concentration that
can be reliably distinguished from the Limit of Blank (LoB) to a confidence of
95%. According to CLSI Guideline EP 17-A, the LoD is defined as the Limit
of Blank (LoB) plus 1.65 times the Standard Deviation of repeated testing at a
single low NO concentration. The Limit of Blank was determined by testing
60 simulated breath samples containing no Nitric Oxide (blanks) and
calculating the upper 95% confidence interval of the mean. The standard
deviation of a low concentration was determined by testing 60 samples of
simulated breath with 10 ppb of Nitric Oxide.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was estimated by determining mean error
(bias) and standard deviation of 60 simulated breath samples at 0 and 10 ppb
NO. The LoQ was calculated as the absolute value of the mean error at 10
ppb plus 2 times standard deviation of error at 0 ppb. Thus, the LoQ was
estimated at 2.1 ppb. Since the CLSLI Guideline EP17-A specifies that the
LoQ cannot be less than the LoD, the sponsor chose the LoQ to be the same as
the LoD of 6.64 ppb.
The result of this analysis is shown in the Table below.

e. Analytical specificity:
Two sets of endogenous interference experiments were conducted.
In the first set of experiments, interference testing was performed on the
Apieron INSIGHT eNO System for the following common constituents of
exhaled breath:
• 200 ppm H (hydrogen)
2
• 3 ppm CO (carbon monoxide)
• 100% Relative Humidity (water vapor)
• 0.5% CO (carbon dioxide)
2
• 0 ppb NO (nitric oxide)
Twenty-four samples containing all of the above potential interferents
(balance air) and 24 samples containing only air were prepared and tested on
the Apieron INSIGHT eNO System. The mean difference in response was
less than 0.05 ppb. The sponsor determined that this difference was not
statistically significant between the samples containing potential interferents
and those containing only air.
In the second set of experiments seven additional compounds were tested at
physiologically relevant concentrations by comparing the response of the
Apieron INSIGHT eNO System to the test gas (balance nitrogen) to nitrogen
alone. The test gas contained 0 ppb NO (nitric oxide). A compound was
deemed non-interfering by the sponsor if, at the tested concentration, the
response was within ±5 ppb NO equivalent when compared to the nitrogen
control. The table below summarizes the results of this testing.

Two compounds (ethanol and methanethiol) showed a statistically significant
(p<0.05) response at the test concentrations; however, the mean response from
both of these compounds was less than 1 ppb.
Clinical Interference Testing (Exogenous Compounds)
The influence of mouthwash containing alcohol, alcohol-free mouthwash,
toothpaste, breath mints, throat lozenges, carbonated beverage with caffeine
and caffeine-free carbonated beverage on eNO was assessed in a clinical
study. Twelve healthy adult subjects (9 males and 3 females; mean age 36 ±
11.8 yrs; range 20-62 yrs) participated in the clinical study. The eNO
measurements for adults ranged from 5 ppb to 99 ppb. The endpoint was the
difference in eNO before as compared to one hour after exposure to each
compound. None of the tested exogenous compounds were found to interfere
(at ± 5 ppb) with the eNO measurement at one hour post-exposure.
In pediatric subjects, the influence of alcohol-free mouthwash, toothpaste,
breath mints, and caffeine-free carbonated beverage on eNO was assessed in a
clinical study. Seven healthy children (6 males and 1 female; ages 5-17 yrs)
participated in the clinical study. The eNO measurements for children ranged
from 3 ppb to 27 ppb. The endpoint was the difference in eNO before as
compared to one hour after exposure to each compound. None of the
exogenous compounds tested were found to interfere (at ± 5 ppb) with the
eNO measurement at one hour post-exposure.

Monitoring the effect of anti-inflammatory therapy in patients with asthma
A multi-center study enrolled 73 steroid naïve subjects at 12 sites with
uncontrolled asthma and elevated exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) to assess the
effect of corticosteroid therapy on eNO. The demographic data for this study
are presented below. Testing was performed by 45 trained technicians,
including: nurses, respiratory therapists, medical assistants, nurse aides, nurse
practitioners and asthma educators. Using the Apieron INSIGHT eNO
System, eNO was measured at baseline and after 2 weeks of corticosteroid
therapy (follow-up). At study entry, the adult asthmatics all had eNO levels ≥
30 ppb and the children asthmatics all had eNO levels ≥ 25 ppb. The objective
of the study was to show that a change in eNO after therapy was related to a
change in asthma symptoms indicating a therapeutic effect of corticosteroid
treatment.

In the study population (n=73) eNO decreased significantly (p<0.0001) in all
subjects combined (-48 ± 25%) and in both the adults (-50 ± 26%) and
children (-46 ± 25%) Of these, there were 5 subjects who did not show a
decrease in eNO following 2 weeks of therapy which represents 7% of the
study population. Exhaled nitric oxide values obtained at baseline and follow-
up were representative across the measurement range of the Apieron
INSIGHT eNO System (10 ppb to 200 ppb). The results are presented in the
table below.

In the entire study population, a greater decrease in eNO was associated with a
greater improvement in asthma symptoms over time (p<0.039) following
corticosteroid therapy. Higher eNO levels at baseline were significantly
associated with greater improvement at follow-up in the spirometry
measurement pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second

were analyzed and resulted in a coefficient of 0.2376 with a p-value of 0.040
with 95% confidence interval (0.0113 – 0.4638). The results are presented in

A method comparison was conducted using Exhaled Nitric Oxide
measurements taken on both the Apieron INSIGHT eNO System and the
NIOX System. A study was conducted on 82 non-randomized asthmatic
subjects at a single site comparing eNO measurements taken with both the
Apieron INSIGHT eNO System and Aerocrine’s NIOX System. The
demographic data for this study are presented below. A total of 58 adults
(ages ≥18 years) and 20 children (ages <18 years) completed the study
resulting in n=78 subjects eligible for analysis. Each subject performed two
breath maneuvers on each system. The testing was performed by 3 trained
technicians. Results were analyzed to evaluate the performance of the
Apieron INSIGHT eNO System as it compares to the NIOX System in a
clinical setting.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The labeling includes the information from American Thoracic Society (ATS) and
the European Respiratory Society ERS as follows: “Guidelines for measuring
exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) were established in 2005 through the recommendation
of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society
ERS as studies have demonstrated that a number of factors can affect eNO levels.
Reference eNO values for healthy children and adults without asthma, obtained
using the standard exhalation rate of 50 ml/s, range from 1.6 to 28.8 ppb. Exhaled
nitric oxide levels are higher in patients with asthma (25 to 80 ppb), are increased
during an asthma exacerbation and are reduced with corticosteroid therapy.
Exhaled nitric oxide is also reported to show a dose-dependent response to
corticosteroid treatment and the response of eNO to corticosteroids has clinical
utility.”
N. Instrument Name:
Apieron INSIGHT eNO System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Apieron INSIGHT eNO System measures eNO via an optical biosensor that
undergoes a change in its optical absorbance when binding with nitric oxide. The
change in optical properties is measured with a ratiometric, two-channel optical
system that measures the change in light absorbance through the Biosensor, which
is contained inside the INSIGHT Sensor. The breath sampling system of the
INSIGHT Monitor follows the flow rate and exhalation pressure recommended by
the 2005 American Thoracic Society Recommendations.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this product:
Yes X or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no mechanism to identify the specimen
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The user obtains a breath sample by exhaling into the device.

5. Calibration:
Each sensor is calibrated at the factory and requires no calibration by the user.
The monitor electronics are calibrated at the factory and are designed to adjust
automatically to minor changes. If there is drift out of range, an error message
appears on the screen. The system will not take eNO measurements while the
monitor is out of calibration range.
The chemistry of the sensor is completely reversible (i.e., when exposed to an
NO-free environment the sensor returns to its pre-exposed state). The
response of each Sensor Cartridge to NO is characterized, stored with the
Sensor Cartridge, and used to calculate the exhaled nitric oxide (eNO)
concentration during a patient test.
6. Quality Control:
The Apieron INSIGHT eNO System is designed to include a QC system into
the design and manufacturing process of the Monitor and supplies as follows:
• Daily Field System QC Test with controlled test gases at 0 (±6 ppb) and 150
ppb (±30 ppb)
• Continuous on-board parameter checking
• Breath maneuver monitoring
• Factory calibration of sensor cartridges.
The Field QC Test is designed to detect system malfunctions that could result
in significant measurement inaccuracy. The ‘false positive’ rate for the Field
QC Test is estimated at approximately 1%. The daily Field QC Test measures
the response of the Apieron INSIGHT eNO System to 0 ppb NO blank and
150 ppb NO gas samples and automatically determines if the response is
within acceptable operating parameters. During the breath maneuver,
exhalation pressure and flow are continuously checked to ensure compliance
with the American Thoracic Society 2005 recommendations. During every
test, key operating parameters in the pneumatic, temperature control, and
optical systems are automatically checked by the Monitor to ensure proper
operation.
