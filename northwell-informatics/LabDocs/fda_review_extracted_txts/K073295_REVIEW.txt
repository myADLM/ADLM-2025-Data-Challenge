L. Test Principle:
Urea is hydrolysed in the presence of water and urease to produce ammonia and
carbon dioxide. In the presence of glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) and reduced
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), the ammonia combines with alpha -
ketoglutarate (α-KG) to produce L-glutamate. The resulting decrease in absorbance at
340 nm, as NADH is converted to NAD, is proportional to the level of urea in the
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was done using serum samples during 21/22 days, with
two runs per day, two replicates per run, total 84/88 results per level.
For levels 1 and 3 the study included 2 reagent lots, 4 operators, 3 T60
instruments at one site, and 9 calibrations. For level 2 the study included 3
reagent lots, 1 operator, 3 T60 instruments at one site, and 9 calibrations. For
the level 4 (~5.7 mg/dL) the precision study was done during 5 days, with two
runs per day, two replicates per run, 1 reagent lot,1 instrument and 2
calibrations with the total number of measurements being 20. Results are
summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study was performed per CLSI EP6-A. The serum samples were
diluted in 10 steps (from 100% to 0%) by mixing samples with each other 1:1.
For example, the 50% sample resulted from a 1:1 mixture of the 100% and
0% samples. Four parallel measurements were made in random order using
one reagent lot (fresh and 30 days open on boarded). To generate samples at
low level, commercially available human sera pool was used, while the same
was spiked with Urea to generate high level samples. In addition, 8 samples
were run using an additional secondary dilution of 1:10 to determine the
extended linearity range. Results were as follows:
Linearity Extended
study Linearity study
2.3-61.85 8.67-194.02
Sample range mg/dL mg/dL
Slope 1.075 1.09
Intercept 0 0
Obs. Error 7.50% 2.90 %
N 10 8
Based on the linearity study data, the sponsor claims a measuring range of
4.2-56 mg/dL and an extended measuring range of 4.2-168 mg/dL after
secondary dilution.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability for sCal:
sCal has been cleared earlier for glucose and Carbon Dioxide in the
submissions k061107 and k071340 respectively.
sCal is traceable to the NIST SRM 909b reference material. sCal target values
are determined using assay specific methods on the DPC T60 and other
Thermo analyzer models. The target value is the median of all values
obtained by these determinations. The exact calibration values are listed in
the separate sCal calibrator sheet. The sponsor recommends that calibration be
performed at least once a month or every time a new bottle of reagent is used
or whenever control results require recalibration.
Traceability for Nortrol and Abtrol:
Controls Nortrol and Abtrol have been cleared earlier for glucose, AST and
Carbon Dioxide in the submissions k061107, k071580 and k071340
respectively.

The target values of the Nortrol and Abtrol are control solutions are
determined using assay specific methods on the T60 and other Thermo
analyzer models (calibrated by the sCal calibrator). The target value is the
median of all values obtained by these determinations.
The sponsor recommends that the quality control samples be used at least
once a day and after each calibration and every time a new bottle of reagent is
used. Further, the control intervals and limits must be adapted to the
individual laboratory requirements. The results of the quality control
sample(s) should fall within the limits pre-set by the laboratory. The sponsor
further recommends that all local, state and federal guidelines be followed.
Stability:
The protocol and acceptance criteria for stability studies were reviewed and
found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims an open on-board stability of
reagents for 30 days. After reconstitution sCal, Abtrol, and Nortrol are stable
for 7 days at 2-8 °C.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) studies were
performed according to CLSI EP17-A using serum samples. In the Limit of
Blank study thirty replicates of a blank sample (0.9% NaCl) were run using
two T60 instruments and one reagent lot with the total number of
measurements being 60. The results support a claimed LOB of 0.3 mg/dL
In the Limit of Detection study five low level samples were run in ten
replicates with two T60 instruments and one reagent lot during two days with
the total number of measurements being 100. The results support a claimed
LOD of 1.2 mg/dL
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference Studies: For each interfering substance three parallel
measurements of one interfering concentration (including non-interfered
sample) were run. There was deemed to be no interference if the observed
values were ± 10% or ± 7.5 U/L of initial value.
Lipemia: No interference found up to 1000 mg/dL (10 g/L) of Intralipid.
Hemolysate: No interference found up to 1000 mg/dL (10 g/L) of hemoglobin
Bilirubin conjugated: No interference found up to 58 mg/dL (1000 μmol/L) of
conjugated bilirubin
Bilirubin unconjugated: No interference found up to 58 mg/dL (1000 μmol/L)
of unconjugated bilirubin.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
6

--- Page 7 ---
One hundred and sixteen Li-heparin plasma samples were analyzed using T60
instrument with Urea / BUN reagents and Bayer Advia 2400 instrument with
Urea Nitrogen reagents to demonstrate the equivalence of the two systems.
The samples were split in two and then run each one either on the
predicate (as singlets) or Thermo device (as duplicates). Each individual
measurement is compared to one individual measurement result of
the predicate. From Thermo device only the first results from the duplicate
measurements were used. Samples ranged from 4.6 mg/ dL to 55.94 mg/ dL.
Data obtained was plotted and the results of the Deming regression analysis
were as follows:
y = 0.92x + 0.937; r = 0.995.
b. Matrix comparison:
Twenty-four matched serum and plasma (Li-heparin) samples were run on
T60 instrument to demonstrate the use of serum samples. Both serum and
plasma samples were run in duplicates but only the first replicate results were
used for calculations. Samples ranged from 4.9 to 55.8 mg/dL. Data obtained
was plotted and the results of the Deming regression analysis were as follows:
y = 1.03x - 0.16; r = 0.999.
