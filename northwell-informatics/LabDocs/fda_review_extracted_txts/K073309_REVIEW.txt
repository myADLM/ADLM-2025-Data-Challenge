3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
HbS or HbC variants significantly interfere with this assay; this method should
not be used to test patient samples with these hemoglobin variants.
4. Special instrument requirements:
ABX PENTRA 400 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The ABX PENTRA HbA1c WB Set contains ready-to-use vials of reagents R1, R2,
R3, R4, R5 and Diluent I. R1 contains particles coupled with mouse anti-human
HbA1c monoclonal antibody in buffer. R2 contains agglutinator reagent containing
covalent polymer-bonding hapten in buffer. R3 contains Hemoglobin denaturant
containing porcine pepsin in buffer. R4 contains the total hemoglobin reagent
containing sodium hydroxide and surfactant. R5 contains diluent I, a saline solution.
This assay may be used in two formats: a method for automatic hemolysis of blood
samples by the ABX PENTA 400 or a method where hemolysis of blood samples is
done manually before analysis by the ABX PENTA 400. The automated analyzer
method uses R1, R2, R3, and R4 while the manual method uses R1, R2, R3, R4, and
R5.
The calibrator kit contains ready to use vials of Calibrators 1 - 6. Each vial contains
HbA1c and hemoglobin in buffer.
The control kit consists of two vials (Control 1 and Control 2). The vials contain
2

L. Test Principle:
HbA1c/Total Hemoglobin ratio is expressed as percentage HbA1c (units %HbA1c)
after the concentrations of both HbA1c and Total Hemoglobin are determined
individually. Whole blood samples are pre-treated with the Hemolysis Reagent to lyse
the red cells and hydrolyze the hemoglobin chain. Total Hemoglobin is converted into
alkaline haematin in the alkaline solution of a non-ionic detergent. Addition of the
pre-treated blood sample to the Total Hb reagent results in a green solution, which is
measured at 600 nm. HbA1c is measured from the hemolysate by a latex enhanced
turbidimetric immunoassay. In the absence of HbA1c in the sample, the antibody-
coated micro-particles in the HbA1c R1 and the agglutinator in R2 will agglutinate.
This leads to an increase in the absorbance of the suspension. The presence of HbA1c
in the sample results in a decrease in the rate of agglutination. The increase in
absorbance is therefore inversely proportional to the concentration of HbA1c in the
sample. The increase in absorbance is measured at 700 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was assessed using two control samples (normal and high) and three
human samples (normal, slightly elevated, and high). Within-run precision
samples were prepared according to test protocol and tested 20 times in a
single run on an ABX PENTRA 400 instrument. Total precision was assessed
using the same samples prepared according to test protocol tested in duplicate
twice a day for 20 days following the method in CLSI EP-5A (n = 80).
Results for the manual method for preparing the hemolysate and the
automated method are shown in the tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linear range of the automatic and the manual hemolysate methods were
evaluated using a high HbA1c sample diluted with a low HbA1c sample.
(Samples prepared as directed for each method.) The dilutions were made as
recommended in the CLSI guideline EP6-A and an analysis was carried out in
accordance with the guideline by performing 1st, 2nd and 3rd order least
squares regressions. The results demonstrated linearity for both datasets. In
addition, the observed values were within ± 10% of the expected values for all
samples tested. The results submitted demonstrated linearity across the
claimed measuring range of 5.0% to 15.2% HbA1c.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor has documented traceability to the NGSP’s recommended
accuracy base for Hbg A1c by performing a direct comparison with a
Secondary Reference Laboratory (SRL) using 40 fresh human specimens.
NGSP certifications expire after one year. Current certifications are posted on
the NGSP website at: http://www.ngsp.org/prog/index.html
A HPLC method for measuring HbA1c concentration and the Drabkin method
for measuring total hemoglobin are used to assign calibrator values. Control

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference from endogenous substances was tested by analysis of whole
blood samples spiked with up to 612 mg/dL triglycerides, 1400 mg/dL
glucose, 29 mg/dL total bilirubin or 29 mg/dL direct bilirubin The results
showed < ± 0.5 % (absolute) interference for each substance at the levels
tested. The labeling refers the user to Young et al. for a list of drugs and pre-
analytical variables known to affect this methodology.
The effect of different concentrations of total hemoglobin on the assay was
tested. There was less than 10% difference between the test value and the
expected HbA1c concentration (not %HbA1c) from 3.83 to 22.60 g/dL (14.6
to 85.7 µmol/L) of total hemoglobin.
Interferences from Hemoglobin C, S, and F as well as interferences from
carbamylated and acetylated hemoglobins were assessed for this assay.
Carbamylated and acetylated hemoglobins did not interfere with the assay
while HbF showed no interference up to 15% HbF. Samples containing HbS
or HbC showed significant interference; this information is in the limitations
section of the labeling. At the time of this decision, NGSP has a list assays
used to measure HbA1C and whether the method is affected by either HbS or
HbC or HbE: http://www.ngsp.org/prog/index.html .

The expected %HbA1c value for patients with diabetes will depend on physician
discretion. In the labeling the sponsor cites the American Diabetes Association’s
(ADA) most recent Clinical Practice Recommendation of diabetes specifies a
treatment goal of 7% or less. This recommendation also suggests additional action
when the HbA1c level is above 8%.

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
