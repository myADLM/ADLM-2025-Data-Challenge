H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell Kit is intended for the enumeration of
circulating tumor cells (CTC) of epithelial origin (CD45-, EpCAM+, and
cytokeratins 8, 18+, and/or 19+) in whole blood.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The presence of CTC in the peripheral blood, as detected by the CellSearch™
Circulating Tumor Cell Kit, is associated with decreased progression free survival
and decreased overall survival in patients treated for metastatic breast, colorectal
or prostate* cancer. The test is to be used as an aid in the monitoring of patients
with metastatic breast, colorectal or prostate cancer. Serial testing for CTC
should be used in conjunction with other clinical methods for monitoring
metastatic breast, colorectal and prostate cancer. Evaluation of CTC at any time
during the course of disease allows assessment of patient prognosis and is
predictive of progression free survival and overall survival.
*Metastatic prostate cancer patients in this study were defined as having two consecutive

The CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell kit was developed in conformance to the
following standards and guidances.

L. Test Principle:
Epithelial cells are immunomagnetically labeled by targeting the Epithelial Cell
Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) antigen. Anti-EpCAM monoclonal antibodies
conjugated to ferrofluid particles are colloidal and, when mixed with a sample
containing the target epithelial cells, bind to the EpCAM antigen associated with the
epithelial cells. After immunomagnetic selection of epithelial cells from 7.5 mL of
blood, fluorescent reagents are added at this time to discriminate between the
immunomagnetically selected cells. Anti-Cytokeratin – Phycoerythrin (CK-PE)
stains the intracellular cytoskeleton cytokeratin proteins expressed in cells of
epithelial origin, anti-CD45-Allophycocyan (CD45-APC) stains leukocytes and DAPI

stains DNA present in the cell nucleus.
The processed reagent/sample mixture is dispensed by the CellTracks® AutoPrep
System into a cartridge that is inserted into a MagNest® cell presentation device. The
strong magnetic field of the MagNest® device causes the magnetically-labeled target
cells to move to the surface of the cartridge. The cartridge is then placed on the
CellTracks® Analyzer II for data acquisition and analysis. The CellTracks Analyzer
II scans the entire surface of the cartridge with a series of fluorescence filters that are
defined for a given assay and acquires images of PE, APC and DAPI fluorescence
staining of the entire viewing surface.
After data acquisition is completed, the images are analyzed for any event where
cytokeratin-PE and DAPI are within a specified space in the cartridge, i.e. indicating
the possible presence of a cell with a nucleus that expresses cytokeratin. Images from
each fluorescent color as well as a composite image of the cytokeratin staining
(green) and the nuclear staining (purple) are presented to the user in a gallery for final
cell classification. A cell is classified as a tumor cell when it its EpCAM+ (i.e., it is
captured), CK+, DAPI+ and CD45-. A check mark placed by the operator next to the
composite images classifies the event as a Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) and the
software tallies all the checked boxes to obtain the CTC count.

Figure 3 Note: There may be more than one point superimposed over another. For example, on this plot,
there are 975 instances (60%) where both tubes had 0 CTC, 116 instances (7%) where Tube 1 had 0 CTC
and Tube 2 had 1 CTC, and another 109 instances (7%) where Tube 1 had 1 CTC and Tube 2 had 0 CTC.
The tube-to-tube variation of CTC counts in blood samples from
metastatic breast and colorectal cancer patients is shown in Figures 1 & 2.
The distribution of infrequent events (such as tumor cells) within a given
volume is random and independent of cell or disease type. This is best
characterized by the Poisson distribution – a mathematical method
employed for modeling systems where the probability of an event
occurring is very low but the number of opportunities for such an event to
occur is large. For tubes with very few prostatic CTC it is reasonable to
expect variation in results similar to what is depicted in Figures 1 & 2.
Because the two previous studies in MBC and MCRC patients showed
almost identical results, a tube-to-tube comparison of CTC counts in blood
samples from metastatic prostate cancer patients was not performed during
the CellSearch™ CTC prostate clinical trial. However, results of an
independent study using CellSearch™ technology conducted at the
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center demonstrated no systematic site-
to-site or tube-to-tube variation in CTC counts across a range of 0 to 1192
CTC per tube in patients with metastatic prostate cancer
Accuracy/Recovery:
Blood samples from a single healthy donor were pooled and five of six 7.5

--- Page 7 ---
mL aliquots were spiked with 5, 20, 81, 325 and 1300 cultured breast
cancer cells (SK-Br-3). The sixth tube was unspiked pooled blood and
served as a zero point. These samples were processed on the CellTracks®
AutoPrep System with the CellSearch™ Circulating Tumor Cell Kit and
CTC counts were determined on the CellTracks® Analyzer II. The
experiment was repeated for four additional donors. The observed cell
counts were plotted against the results of the expected cell count. The
results are summarized in Table 2.
Table 2. Percent Detection Estimates.
Mean Observed
Expected Tumor Cell Tumor Cell
Count Count Range of Percent Recovery
1300 1215 91 to 95%
325 308 82 to 101%
81 85 80 to 136%
20 22 95 to 140%
5 7 120 to 200%
To determine the overall, or least squares fit, for the comparison of the
observed and expected cell counts across all the data, linear regression
analysis was performed. The regression equation for these 30 samples was
y=0.93x + 3.87, R2=0.999. The results of this study indicate that on average
over the tested CTC range the recovery, as derived from regression analysis, is
93%.
Given the linear response of the tumor cell counts, one would expect the slope
of the observed versus expected plot to be 1.0. However, the slope was 0.93.
This is because the CellTracks® AutoPrep System with CellSearch™ CTC Kit
involves the capture and fluorescent labeling of cells followed by their
detection and enumeration by the CellTracks® Analyzer II. The loss of cells
could therefore be attributed to one of the following possibilities; 1) the
recovery of only 93% of the tumor cells spiked into 7.5mL of blood by the
CellTracks® AutoPrep System, 2) the detection of only 93% of the tumor cells
present in the sample chamber by the CellTracks® Analyzer II or 3) a
combination of both of these sources of error.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Another way to examine the previous data is to analyze it as a dilution series
to evaluate test linearity. The confounding variable of percent recovery was
removed by using the observed value of the original sample divided by the
dilution factors to determine the expected values for the dilution series for
each patient sample. Regression of all of these numbers of observed tumor
cells versus the numbers of expected tumor cells yielded a slope of 1.007, an
intercept of 3.0, an r2 = 0.99 and r = 0.995. Therefore, once the percent
recovery (cell loss) was factored out of the CTC values of each of the original

samples, this analysis of the data demonstrated that the detection of CTC was
linear over the reportable range of 0 to 1238 tumor cells.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
No recognized reference material or method.
d. Detection limit:
One CTC per 7.5 mL can be detected by the CellTracks® Analyzer II resulting
in a limit of detection of 1 CTC in a cartridge. Linear regression shows that
on average, 93% of CTC present in a 7.5 mL blood sample are recovered
using the CellTracks® AutoPrep System (see Recovery section). The loss of
approximately 7% of the CTC in the sample is not sufficient to reduce the
limit of detection of 1 CTC.
d. Analytical specificity
Interfering Substances:
Interference studies were not performed for prostate cancer cells. In the
submission for metastatic breast cancer, SK-BR-3 cells spiked into blood
samples were exposed to potential interfering substances and compared to
untreated controls. Toxic levels (5 times therapeutic index) of the following
cancer drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and other exogenous substances were
tested: cyclophosphamide, Mitomycin C®, Procrit®, biotin, 5-fluorouracil,
methotrexate, tamoxifen citrate, paclitaxel, Arimidex®, acetaminophen,
acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, dextromethorphan, Aredia®, Herceptin®, and
ibuprofen. No significant differences in SK-BR-3 cell numbers were detected,
indicating that these substances do not interfere with the CellSearch™ kit.
Samples spiked with toxic levels of doxorubicin resulted in aberrant staining
of leukocytes as cytokeratin and CD45 dual positive cells, due to the
doxorubicin being a fluorescent compound that is incorporated into nucleated
cells. If seen, the staining pattern of all cells being CD45 positive and
cytokeratin positive is obvious and easily identified by the operator as a
known interference staining profile. If blood is drawn after the recommended
7-day washout period, following doxorubicin infusion, this interference is
unlikely to be observed in clinical practice given controlled therapeutic levels
and rapid drug clearance.
Potential interference from lipemia was studied by adding Intralipid to
samples to a concentration of 2.6%, which corresponds to greater than 1000
mg/dL triglyceride. Samples were lysed to simulate total hemolysis.
Bilirubin at 7.4 mg/dL, HAMA type 1/HAMA type 2 and hematocrit from 18-
60% were studied. Lipemia, hemolysis, icterus and a broad range of
hematocrit values do not interfere with the CellSearch™ test. HAMA 1 and
HAMA 2 also do not interfere, indicating that individuals receiving mouse Ig
by parenteral routes can be tested successfully with the CellSearchTM test.
f. Assay cut-off:
Results are reported as the number of CTC/7.5 mL of blood. A CTC count of
5 or more per 7.5 mL of blood is predictive of shorter progression free
survival and overall survival for metastatic prostate cancer.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Direct comparison to the predicate device is not feasible since the patient
population used by the two tests is different (metastatic breast cancer vs.
metastatic colon cancer) rather, clinical studies are necessary to establish the
new indication for use. These were performed by the sponsor.
b. Matrix comparison:
Since there is only one matrix for this test, i.e. whole blood, no matrix
comparison studies were performed.
3. Clinical studies:

Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:

Clinical Studies to Support Prognostic Use of Veridex CTC Test with Metastatic
Prostate Cancer (MPC) Patients
A multi-center prospective, clinical trial was conducted to determine whether the number
of CTC predicted disease progression and survival. Metastatic prostate cancer patients in
this study were defined as having two consecutive increases in the serum marker
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) above a reference level, despite standard hormonal
management. These patients are commonly described as having androgen-independent,
hormone-resistant, or castration-resistant prostate cancer. A total of 231 metastatic
prostate cancer patients with evidence of (PSA) progression despite standard hormonal
therapy and starting a new line or type of chemotherapy were enrolled. Clinical data
were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. Patient demographic information is presented
in Table 3.

Baseline CTC count was determined prior to initiation of a new line of chemotherapy.
The following timeframes were chosen for evaluation: baseline (prior to the initiation of
therapy), 2-5 weeks (14 - 41 days from baseline), 6-8 weeks (42 - 62 days from baseline),
9-12 weeks (63 - 90 days from baseline), and 13-20 weeks (91 - 146 days from baseline)
after the initiation of therapy. If more than one blood draw fell within the designated
timeframes, the blood draw furthest from the baseline blood draw was used as the result
for each timeframe.
CTC frequencies
All 231 evaluable MPC patients had a baseline blood draw. Two hundred and twenty-
one (221) of these MPC patients had one or more follow-up blood draws after the
initiation of therapy. Of the ten MPC patients with only a baseline blood draw, three died
before a follow-up blood draw could be obtained, one progressed and was sent to
hospice, one stopped their chemotherapy due to a broken hip, one patient moved, three
refused any further blood draws, and one withdrew their consent for the study. There
were a total of 214, 171, 158, and 149 MPC patients with follow-up blood draws 2-5
weeks, 6-8 weeks, 9-12 weeks, and 13-20 weeks after the initiation of therapy,
respectively.
In metastatic prostate cancer, disease progression is primarily determined using changes
in PSA. For this study, disease progression was determined by the sites using PSA,
imaging, and/or clinical signs and symptoms. For the baseline analyses, progression free
survival (PFS) was determined from the time of the baseline blood draw to the
determination of progression or death, and overall survival (OS) was determined from the
time of the baseline blood draw to the date of death or the date of last contact with the
patient. For the follow-up analyses, PFS was determined from the time of the follow-up
blood draw to diagnosis of progression or death, and OS was determined from the time of
the follow-up blood draw to the date of death or the date of last contact with the patient.

Patients with progression prior to the date of the blood draw being evaluated were
excluded from the PFS analyses of that time point and all subsequent follow-up blood
draws. Patients with no additional survival follow-up beyond the date of the blood draw
being evaluated were excluded from the PFS & OS analyses of that time point. Table 4
shows the numbers of patients at each time point excluded from the PFS or PFS & OS
analyses and the reasons for their exclusion.

The CTC results obtained from the baseline and follow-up blood draws at 2-5 weeks, 6-8
weeks, 9-12 weeks, and 13-20 weeks after the initiation of therapy were classified as
being favorable (<5 CTC) or unfavorable (≥5 CTC). The PSA, Alkaline Phosphatase,
and LDH levels summarized in the demographics table and used in the analyses were all
measured at a central laboratory in serum samples collected at the same time as the blood
samples used for CTC evaluation. The hemoglobin and albumin levels summarized in
the tables and used in the analyses were values provided by the sites and verified from the
patient’s medical records that were determined within ± 30 days of the baseline CTC
evaluation.
Progression Free Survival (PFS) Analysis of MPC Patients
PFS Using Baseline CTC Results
Two hundred nineteen (219) of the 231 evaluable patients had a baseline CTC result
available. For Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients were segmented into two groups based
upon their CTC count at baseline:
• The Favorable group (N=94), represented in green, consisted of patients with
<5 CTC.
• The Unfavorable group (N=125), represented in red, consisted of patients
with ≥5 CTC.
Median PFS was longer in the Favorable group compared to the Unfavorable group (5.8
vs. 4.2 months, respectively.) These results are illustrated in Figure 3 or Table 5.

PFS Using Follow-up CTC Results
For Kaplan-Meier analysis, MPC patients were segmented into two groups based upon
their CTC count at each of the various follow-up blood draws. Both patient groups at
each of the different follow-up blood draws after initiation of therapy for PFS are
illustrated in Figure 4. This figure illustrates the ability of CTC in MPC patients with <5
and ≥5 CTC to predict time to clinical progression or death at 2-5 weeks (n=199), 6-8
weeks (n=141), 9-12 weeks (n=134) and 13-20 weeks (n=116) after the initiation of
therapy.
• The Favorable group represented in olive green, blue, purple, and cyan
consisted of patients with <5 CTC at 2-5, 6-8, 9-12, and 13-20 weeks after the
initiation of therapy, respectively.
• The Unfavorable group, represented in brown, black, grey, and orange
consisted of patients with ≥5 CTC at 2-5, 6-8, 9-12, and 13-20 weeks after the
initiation of therapy, respectively.

As illustrated in Figure 4 and Table 5, MPC patients with elevated CTC (≥5 CTC/7.5mL
whole blood) at any of the time points had a much higher likelihood of rapid progression
than did those with <5 CTC. Table 5 column 4 shows the median PFS times for those
patients with <5 CTC ranged from 4.1 to 6.5 months and were substantially longer than
the median PFS times for those patients with ≥5 CTC, which ranged from 1.2 to 4.2
months (column 5).

Reduction or Increase in CTC Predicts Improved or Decreased PFS
Elapsed PFS times were calculated from the baseline blood draw. For the Kaplan-Meier
analysis shown in Figure 5, MPC patients were segmented into four groups based upon
their CTC counts at baseline, 2-5 weeks, 6-8 weeks, 9-12 weeks, and 13-20 weeks after
the initiation of therapy:
• Group 1 (green curve), 88 (38%) patients with <5 CTC at all time points.
Five (6%) of these patients only had a baseline blood draw while seven (8%)
had a single blood draw between their first and last blood draw that had ≥5
CTC;
• Group 2 (blue curve), 45 (20%) patients with ≥5 CTC prior to the initiation of
therapy but who had decreased to <5 CTC at the time of their last blood draw;
• Group 3 (orange curve), 26 (11%) patients with <5 CTC at an early draw
(baseline, 2-5 weeks, and/or 6-8 weeks) but who increased to ≥5 CTC at the
time of their last blood draw;
• Group 4 (red curve), 71 (31%) patients with ≥5 CTC at all draw time points.
Eight (11%) of these patients had only a baseline blood draw and two (3%)
had a single blood draw between their first and last blood draw that had <5
CTC.
Figure 5 shows that MPC patients with ≥5 CTC at all time points (Group 4) had the
shortest median PFS, which was significantly different compared to the median PFS of
Group 3, Group 2 and Group 1. The difference in the median PFS between those
patients who showed a CTC reduction after the initiation of therapy (Group 2) was
significantly longer compared to those patients who showed a CTC increase (Group 3).

OS Analysis Using Baseline CTC Results
Death occurred in 119 (52%) of the 231 MPC patients, with a mean follow-up time for
the 112 (48%) patients still alive of 16.1 ± 4.9 months (median = 16.5 months, range =
1.9 to 25.7 months). At the time of these analyses, 28 (30%) of 94 patients from the
Favorable group (<5 CTC at baseline) compared to 83 (66%) of 125 from the
Unfavorable group (≥5 CTC at baseline) had died.
For Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 219 of the 231 evaluable patients that had baseline results
were segmented into two groups based upon their CTC count at baseline:
• The Favorable group (N=94), represented in green, consisted of patients with <5
CTC.
• The Unfavorable group (N=125), represented in red, consisted of patients with ≥5
CTC.
Median OS was significantly longer in the Favorable group compared to the Unfavorable
group (21.7 vs. 11.5 months, respectively). These results are illustrated in Figure 6.

Figure 8 shows that those patients with ≥5 CTC at any point after the initiation of
therapy had a much higher likelihood of dying sooner. Patients with ≥5 CTC at all time
points (Group 4) had the shortest median OS, which was significantly different
compared to the median OS of Group 2, and Group 1 but not Group 3. Patients with
<5 CTC at all time points (Group 1) had the longest median OS, which was significantly
different compared to the median OS of Group 4 and Group 3, but not Group 2.
Figure 8 also demonstrated that patients who showed a decrease in CTC (Group 2)
improve their survival chances and had a median OS similar to those patients with
favorable CTC at all draws (Group 1). The figure also shows that unfavorable CTC
levels after the initiation of therapy significantly decreased overall survival (Group 3 and
Group 4).
Univariate Cox Regression Analysis in MPC Patients
Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to evaluate the
association of the following pre-treatment parameters with PFS and OS: stage of disease
at diagnosis (1-4), patient age (≥70 or <70 years), ECOG status before initiation of a new
line of therapy (0-2), Gleason score (2-10), hemoglobin level within ± 30 days of baseline
draw (g/dL, continuous), albumin level within ± 30 days of baseline draw (g/dL,
continuous), testosterone level at the time of the baseline draw (ng/mL, continuous),
LDH level at the time of the baseline draw (IU/mL, continuous), alkaline phosphatase

--- Page 20 ---
level at the time of the baseline draw (IU/mL, continuous), PSA level at the time of the
baseline draw (ng/mL, continuous), pre-treatment PSA doubling time (months,
continuous), pre-treatment PSA velocity (ng/mL/month, continuous), line of therapy (1st,
2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th), type of therapy (taxotere included or not), presence of measurable
disease (yes or no), presence of bone metastasis (yes or no), presence of visceral
metastasis (yes or no), and baseline CTC level (≥5 CTC/7.5mL or <5 CTC/7.5mL) and
follow up CTC counts at 2-5, 6-8, 9-12 and 13-20 weeks.
For these analyses, the elapsed times for both PFS and OS were calculated from the time
of the baseline blood draw. The Cox regression results (i.e. the hazards ratio and
associated 95% confidence interval, chi-square value, and associated p-values) for the
ability of the parameters to independently predict PFS and OS are provided in Table 7 as
well as the number of patients in each evaluation.

Multivariate Cox Regression Analysis in MPC Patients
Multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the independent
predictive power of CTC count by adjusting for the effects of the known important
clinical factors that are statistically significant in the univariate analyses. CTC were
found to be strongest predictors at most time points of PFS and OS (Table 8).

Use of CTC to Monitor Clinical Status of Metastatic Prostate Cancer Patients
Relationship between survival, CTCs and disease assessment by PSA
At present, a reduction in PSA is one of the primary means to determine response to
therapy in MPC patients. To establish the relationship of clinical status as determined by
a PSA to CTC, reduction of ≥30% or ≥50% PSA and CTC were measured 2-5 weeks, 6-8
weeks, 9-12 weeks and 13-20 weeks after initiation of therapy and compared to overall
survival.
For the Kaplan-Meier analysis the elapsed OS times were calculated from the time of
blood draw. Patients were segmented into Favorable groups based upon a CTC of <5 at
the time of evaluation and a ≥30% reduction of PSA from baseline to the time of
evaluation. Patients were segmented into Unfavorable groups based upon a CTC of ≥5
and <30% reduction of PSA from baseline to the time of evaluation.
Figure 9 shows the results of the analysis 2-5 weeks after initiation of therapy, Figure 10
the analysis 6-8 weeks after initiation of therapy, Figure 11 the analysis 9-12 weeks after
initiation of therapy and Figure 12 the analysis 13-20 weeks after initiation of therapy.

Concordances between CTC and PSA Changes in MPC Patients
The data in Figure 9 through 12 and in Table 9, illustrate a highly significant difference
in overall survival between patients with Unfavorable CTC and Favorable CTC at all
time points tested, whereas PSA evaluations were not significant until 6-8 weeks after the
initiation of therapy. Although the differences in median OS between the Favorable
(≥30% or ≥50% PSA reduction from baseline) and Unfavorable (<30% or <50% PSA
reduction from baseline) PSA reduction groups were significant, the separation between
the Favorable (<5 CTC) and Unfavorable (≥5 CTC) CTC groups appeared greater and
was significant at all time points after the initiation of therapy.
At present, either a ≥30% or ≥50% reduction in PSA is commonly used to evaluate
disease progression in metastatic prostate cancer patients. Therefore, to establish the
relationship between CTC and changes in PSA two by two tabulations of concordant and
discordant observations between CTC and PSA changes for each time point after the
initiation of therapy were constructed. Although comparisons of CTC to PSA change at
both magnitudes were calculated, only data from the CTC vs. ≥30% PSA change are
reported. This decision was based on a recent publication (J Nat Ca Inst. 98 (8):p.516-
521, 2006) demonstrating that a 3-month 30% PSA decline showed a stronger association
with decrease in risk of death than did a 50% decrease in PSA. Furthermore, a
comparison of patient–wise and observation-wise results from the 30% and 50% PSA
decline vs. CTC analyses did not demonstrate substantial differences in the Positive %
Agreement, Negative % Agreement and Overall Agreement at any of the observed time
points.
A total of 197, 159, 146, and 138 patients had serum samples analyzed by the central
laboratory and had evaluable CTC results 2-5 weeks, 6-8 weeks, 9-12 weeks, and 13-20
weeks after the initiation of therapy, respectively. To determine a patient’s response to
therapy, the percent change in PSA from the baseline value was calculated for each of the
time points after the initiation of therapy. For PSA changes at each time point, the
Favorable group was defined as patients with a ≥30% reduction in PSA and the
Unfavorable group was defined as patients with a <30% reduction in PSA. For CTC at
each time point, the Favorable group was defined as patients having <5 CTC per 7.5mL
of blood and the Unfavorable group was defined as patients having ≥5 CTC.
Because CTC vs. PSA results of the patient-wise comparisons between CTC and a ≥30%
PSA reduction at 2-5 weeks and 13-20 weeks after the initiation of therapy showed the
most significant discordance and concordance, respectively, these data are presented in
Table 10 and Table 11, respectively.

The overall concordance between CTC and PSA changes at the various time points after
the initiation of therapy ranged from 59% to 77% when comparing to a ≥30% PSA
reduction and from 52% to 75% when comparing to a ≥50% PSA reduction, showing that
there was discordance between CTC and PSA changes in ~25% to 40% of the patients.
CTC Levels and PSA Reduction Combined to Predict OS in MPC Patients
To determine which of the discordant results better reflected the prognosis of the patient,
CTC assessment and changes in PSA 2-5 weeks, 6-8 weeks, 9-12 weeks and 13-20 weeks
after initiation of therapy were compared to overall survival. Elapsed OS times were
calculated from the blood draw being evaluated. For the Kaplan-Meier analysis Figure
13 (Panels A, B, C and D) patients were segmented into four groups based upon their
CTC counts and PSA reduction at 2-5 weeks, 6-8 weeks, 9-12 weeks, and 13-20 weeks
after the initiation of therapy, respectively:
• Group 1 (green curve), patients with <5 CTC at the time of evaluation and a
≥30% reduction of PSA from baseline to the time of evaluation;
• Group 2 (blue curve), patients with <5 CTC at the time of evaluation and a <30%
reduction of PSA from baseline to the time of evaluation;
• Group 3 (orange curve), patients with ≥5 CTC at the time of evaluation and a
≥30% reduction of PSA from baseline to the time of evaluation
• Group 4 (red curve), patients with ≥5 CTC at the time of evaluation and a <30%
reduction of PSA from baseline to the time of evaluation.

Figure 13 shows that patients with ≥5 CTC at any point after the initiation of therapy had
a much higher likelihood of dying sooner, irrespective of the changes in PSA levels from
baseline. Patients with ≥5 CTC at all time points (Group 3 and Group 4) had the
shortest median overall survivals, which were not significantly different. However, the
median OS of these two groups was significantly different compared to the median OS of
the patients with <5 CTC at all time points (Group 1 and Group 2). These two groups
(Group 1 and Group 2) had the longest median overall survivals, which were not
significantly different. The important finding illustrated in Figure 13 is that although a
reduction of PSA at some points after initiation of therapy may reach significance for
prediction of survival, Favorable CTC at any time point were more accurate than the PSA
evaluation. The practical implication is the use of CTC analysis for the evaluation of the
probability of survival of MPC patients. In cases where CTC and PSA change were
discordant, CTC provided the most accurate assessment of prognosis.
