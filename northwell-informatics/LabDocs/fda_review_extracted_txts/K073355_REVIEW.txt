L. Test Principle:
Calcium ions form a highly colored complex with Arsenazo III at neutral pH. The
amount of the complex is measured at 660 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The Precision study was performed according to CLSI EP5-A. The precision study was
done during 20 to 21 days using three levels of controls, with two runs per day, two
replicates per run, total 80 to 84 results per level, including 3 reagent lots, 1 operator, 3
T60 instruments at one site, and 10 calibrations.
Within run Between run Total
Level N Sample Mean SD %CV SD %CV SD %CV
Level 1 84 4.0 mg/dL 0.04 1.0 0.02 0.6 0.06 1.6
Level 2 84 8.4 mg/dL 0.07 0.8 0.03 0.4 0.12 1.5
Level 3 80 11.9 mg/dL 0.08 0.7 0.08 0.7 0.18 1.5
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study was performed based on CLSI EP6-A. The samples were diluted in
steps from 0% to 100% by mixing samples with each other 1:1. Four parallel
measurements were made in random order using one reagent lot.
Linearity Study Extended Linearity Study
Sample Range 2.1 – 17.7 mg/dL 9.3 – 56.5 mg/dL
N 8 11
Slope 1.012 0.970
Intercept -0.07 0.292
Observer Error 2.4% 5.0%
Based on the linearity study data, the sponsor will claim a measuring range of 2.8 – 16.0
mg/dL and an extended range of 2.8 – 48.0 mg/dL after secondary dilution.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor’s protocols indicate that each calibrator (sCal), and control (Nortrol and
Abtrol) lot is traceable to NIST SRM 909b. The values are assigned based on multi
determinations performed using T60 instruments. The assigned value is the median of all
the values generated for each calibrator and control. Additionally, control range is
calculated as the target value ± 2 standard deviations. The expected values for each lot
are provided on the value sheet provided with the product.
The sponsor supports a claim of an open on-board stability of reagents for 30 days. After
reconstitution sCal, Abtrol, and Nortrol are stable for 7 days at 2-8 °C.

The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) studies were performed
according to CLSI EP17-A. In the LoB study, thirty replicates of a blank sample (0.9%
NaCl) were run using two T60 instruments and two reagent lots with the total number of
measurements being 60. The LoB was determined to be 0.02 mg/dL.
In the Limit of Detection study five low level samples were run in ten replicates with two
T60 instruments and two reagent lots during two days with the total number of
measurements being 100. The LoD was determined to be 0.08 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The interference study was performed according to CLSI EP7-A. In a paired-difference
testing using with three levels of analyte both control and test pools were analyzed, with
four replicates from each pool, within one analytical run. The sponsor defined
interference as a difference exceeding ± 10% of the test value compared to control value.
According to the interference studies the following claims were established:
Lipemia: No interference found up to 1000 mg/dl (10 g/l) of Intralipid.
Hemolysate: No interference found up to 1000 mg/dl (10 g/l) of hemoglobin
Bilirubin conjugated: No interference found up to 58 mg/dl (1000 µmol/l) of conjugated
bilirubin
Bilirubin total: No interference found up to 58 mg/dl (1000 µmol/l) of unconjugated
bilirubin.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
One hundred and twelve Li-heparin plasma samples (104 clinical, 2 diluted) were
analyzed using T60i instrument with Calcium reagents and Bayer Advia 2400 instrument
with Calcium reagents to demonstrate the equivalence of the two systems. Samples
ranged from range from 3.2 to 14.6 mg/dL. The samples were split in two and then run
each one either on the predicate or Thermo device. Each individual measurement was
compared to one individual measurement result of the predicate. Deming regression
analysis resulted in the equation, y = 1.03x + 0.096, r = 0.987.
b. Matrix comparison:
Ninety-seven matched serum and plasma (Li-heparin) samples (94 clinical, 3 contrived)
were run on T60 instrument to demonstrate the use of serum samples. Samples ranged
from range from 6.3 to 15.0 mg/ dL. Both serum and plasma samples were run in
duplicates and each individual measurement was compared to one individual
measurement. Deming regression analysis resulted in the equation, y = 0.95x + 0.373, r
= 0.990.
