Software: PlexusTM Multi Analyte Diagnostic Software for Luminex xMAP
instrument with Luminex IS 2.3 software (SW.MP0001)
I. Device Description:
The Focus Diagnostics Plexus™ EBV IgM uses an Antigen Bead suspension that
contains two distinct EBV antigen bead types (VCA and Heterophile) and one
process control bead type that fluoresce at different wavelengths and/or
intensities.
1. Patient sera are diluted, and the diluted sera are incubated with Antigen
Beads. If EBV antibodies are present, then the antibodies bind to the
corresponding antigen beads.
2. Phycoerythrin-conjugated goat Anti-human IgM (Conjugate) is added,
binds to the bound EBV antibody (if present), and forms a Conjugate-EBV
antibody-antigen bead sandwich.
3. Fluorescence from each distinct EBV antigen bead type is measured and
compared against a Cutoff Calibrator.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The inter/intra-assay reproducibility and the inter-laboratory reproducibility
testing were performed at three laboratories. Each of the three laboratories tested
twelve samples in triplicate on five different days. For positive specimens, the
inter-lab % CV varied from 9-16% for VCA IgM and 7 -14% for heterophile
antibody assays.

f. Assay cut-off:
Establishment of the cutoff values for the EBV IgM Plexus was performed
using 585 patient serum samples submitted for EBV testing. These samples
were first tested on the predicate devices (Diamedix ELISA for VCA IgM,
and the Accutest for infectious mononucleosis). Each sample was classified
as positive, negative or equivocal for each of these assays. The serum
samples were then run on the EBV IgM Plexus assay. Comparisons were
made for each analyte with its respective predicate test (excluding equivocal
samples on the predicated device) on a Receiver Operating Characteristics
(ROC) analysis. Based on the ROC analysis graphs a cutoff value was
obtained.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method Comparison: EBV VCA IgM Assay
Performance of the Plexus EBV VCA IgM analyte was tested against a combination
(hereafter referred to as ‘consensus comparator’) of a FDA-cleared commercially
available ELISA, an immunofluorescent (IFA) test and a flow cytometry based
immunoassay. For each sample, a consensus based algorithm (2/3) was used to
determine the predicate result for comparison with the Plexus VCA IgM result.
Serological status was determined by the use of commercially available ELISA assays for
the EBV analytes EBNA-1 IgG, VCA IgG, EA-D IgG, VCA IgM and heterophile
antibody.
EBV VCA-IgM vs. Consensus Comparator: Comparison by serological status
of prospective population (N = 723). Samples were collected and tested by a
Northeast investigator (n = 350), a Mid-West investigator (n=249), and Focus
(n=124).
