L. Test Principle:
The Focus Diagnostics Plexus™ EBV IgG Multi-Analyte Diagnostic is a three step
procedure.
1. Patient sera are diluted and incubated with multiplexed bead suspension
consisting of a mixture of distinguishable sets of polystyrene beads. Conjugated to
the primary set of beads are the following EBV antigens; EA-D, EBNA- 1 and VCA.
The bead mix also contains one background bead set designed to check for non-
specific reactivity in the patient sample. If EBV antibodies are present, then the

antibodies bind to the corresponding antigen beads. The beads are rinsed to remove
non-reactive serum proteins.
2. Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated goat anti human IgG, (Conjugate) is added, and
the conjugate binds to the bound EBV antibody. The beads are rinsed to remove non-
reactive conjugate.
3. Fluorescence from each distinct EBV antigen bead type is measured and
compared against a Cutoff calibrator. The fluorescence is read in a plate reader,
similar to an ELISA reader. Beads are first read with an orange laser to identify the
bead type (e.g., EB-D, VCA, EBNA-1, or background), and then read with a green
laser to the measure amount of fluorescence from the PE contained in the conjugate.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The inter/intra-assay reproducibility and the inter-laboratory reproducibility

tested twelve samples in triplicate on five different days. The results of the

e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor evaluated the potential cross-reactivity of the assay as follows:
samples positive for similar disease states and potentially cross-reactive
factors as determined by an FDA cleared device were tested with the Plexus
EBV kit for each of the three (VCA, EA-D and EBNA-1) IgG analytes.
Additionally 41 samples negative for EBV by an FDA cleared device and
positive for some of possible cross reacting agents were included. The panel
consisted of (ANA= 28, CMV= 31, HSV-1= 29, HSV-2=13, HSV-6= 4,
Rubeola Virus =1, Mumps = 1, Rubella Virus=39, Toxoplasma gondii =19,
and VZA= 35). Because of the high prevalence of EBV IgG antibodies in the
normal population, the test samples were also evaluated on commercially
available ELISA. The majority of all samples that did elicit a positive result
were also confirmed positive by the corresponding commercially available

ELISA, indicating reactivity to EBV IgG antibodies rather than cross
reactivity with a potentially interfering factor. ANA showed possible cross
reactivity with the EBNA-1 analyte, and HSV2 showed possible cross
reactivity with the VCA analyte.
Potential cross reactivity with E. coli and Pichia pastoris which are the
recombinant vector for the EAD and EBNA-1 antigens used in the assay was
not assessed, due to difficulties in obtaining the appropriate samples.

The sponsor assessed the test’s performance with potentially interfering
substances by spiking four samples with two levels of four different
potentially interfering substances. Four samples, two positive and two
negative for EBV IgG antibodies by Plexus EBV IgG were used in the study.
Baseline levels for triglycerides, albumin, bilirubin, and hemoglobin were
established for each sample. The remaining serum was spiked with purchased
interfering substances at levels that exceeded the expected human range. The
spiked samples were tested again in the assay to determine if the elevated
levels of interfering substances affected the assay. It was thus concluded that
no interference was observed for any of the interfering substances in either the
positive or negative sample.
f. Assay cut-off:
Establishment of the cutoff values for the EBV IgG and IgM Plexus was
performed using 585 patient serum samples submitted for EBV testing. These
samples were first tested on the predicate devices (Diamedix ELISA for VCA
IgG, VCA IgM, EA, EBNA, and the Accutest for infectious mononucleosis).
Each sample was classified as positive, negative or equivocal for each of these
assays. The serum samples were then run on the EBV IgG and IgM Plexus
assay. Comparisons were made for each analyte with its respective predicate
test (excluding equivocal samples on the predicated device) on a Receiver
Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis. Based on the ROC analysis graphs
a cutoff value was obtained.

a. Method comparison with reference method:
Performance of the Plexus EBNA-1 IgG and Plexus EA-D IgG analytes was
compared to the Diamedix EBNA-1 and EA-D ELISA tests. The performance
of the Plexus EBV VCA IgG analyte was compared to a consensus
comparator consisting of the predicate device the Diamedix VCA IgG ELISA
and 2 other devices; Athena Multi-Lyte EBV IgG Test System and Focus

EBV-VCA Antibody (IgG) IFA. For each sample, a consensus based
algorithm (2/3) was used to determine the predicate result for comparison with
the Plexus VCA IgG result. The studies were conducted at three United States
testing sites: a hospital laboratory located in Northeast (n = 350), a pediatric
hospital laboratory located in the Mid-West (n=249), and Focus (n=124) with
serum samples in which EBV tests were ordered. The sera were sequentially
submitted to the laboratory, archived, and masked. Samples were collected at
three sites and include both prospective (n = 723) and retrospective (n = 150)
specimens all tested by the Mid-West investigator. Retrospective samples
were pre-selected based on EBV VCA IgM positive results from a FDA
cleared device. Results are summarized per analyte, broken by the serological
classification.
Serological status was determined by the use of the Diamedix ELISA assays
for the EBV analytes EBNA-1 IgG, VCA IgG, EA-D IgG and VCA IgM and
a commercially available heterophile rapid test for the heterophile antibody,
and following a generally accepted classification chart.
