I. Device Description:
®
The LIAISON Rubella IgG assay is an indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay
(CLIA) for qualitative determination of IgG specific to rubella virus. The test uses a
first incubation to allow rubella antibodies from the samples to bind to magnetic
particles (solid phase) coated with rubella antigen. A second incubation facilitates the
reaction of an isoluminol-antibody conjugate (using mouse monoclonal antibody to
human IgG) with the rubella IgG bound to the solid phase. Detection is performed
through chemiluminescence reaction once the starter reagents are added. The light
signal, and hence the amount of isoluminol-antibody conjugate, is measured by a
photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU), and correlated to detection of rubella
antibody from the sample. The assay is calibrated by means of two calibrators
(cleared with this submission) that are traceable to the 1st WHO standard reference
material for Rubella IgG (RUBI-1-94). The test results are reported as index values
with an associated interpretation of “Negative”, “Equivocal”, or “Positive” for the
2

presence of anti-rubella IgG at the cut-off value of 1.0, which corresponds to 10
International Units/mL (IU/mL) (equivocal zone is set greater than index 0.9 and less
than index 1.0 IU/mL). The test results are to be used in conjunction with other
clinical information and history to suggest immune status versus rubella virus.

L. Test Principle:
All assay steps (with the exception of magnetic particle resuspension) and incubations
are performed by the LIAISON® Analyzer. The principal components of the test are
magnetic particles (solid phase) coated with Rubella antigen and a conjugate of
mouse monoclonal antibody to human IgG linked to an isoluminol derivative
(isoluminol-antibody conjugate). During the first incubation, Rubella virus antibodies
present in the calibrators, specimens or controls bind to the solid phase. During the
second incubation, the antibody conjugate reacts with Rubella virus IgG already
bound to the solid phase. After each incubation, the unbound material is removed
with a wash cycle. Subsequently, the starter reagents are added and a flash
chemiluminescence reaction is thus induced. The light signal, and hence the amount

Precision:
Assay precision performance was established at DiaSorin in a 20-day study
following protocol outlined in CLSI document, EP5-A2. A coded panel
comprised of 12 frozen repository samples was prepared by DiaSorin and tested
in the LIAISON® Rubella IgG assay. The panel contained samples prepared to
represent negative levels, low to mid positive analyte levels and moderate to high
positive levels. All panel members were divided into aliquots and stored frozen
prior to testing. The coded panel was tested in four replicates per run for twenty
runs. The results are summarized in the following table.

Stability: Kit and Controls:
Storage:
In accordance with recognized standard EN 13640:2001, studies were
performed in which three kit lots were tested after storing in conditions
different from those recommended (2-8°C) to simulate the stress of transport.
A coded panel was tested in parallel by the stressed kit and not-stressed kits
stored at +2-8°C, according to the package insert. Controls were tested by
stressing one control lot at the specific conditions and testing it in parallel
with non-stressed controls.
The performed tests were considered satisfactory when compared to the
acceptable criteria to support the following claims:
Storage of Reagent Integral kit and controls up to five days at +30°C.
The recommendation in the package insert is that the reagent integral should
not be frozen.
Storage of Reagent Integral kit and controls for 24 hrs at +37°C.
On-board stability:
On-board stability was evaluated after simulating the storage conditions
usually found in user laboratories. The study was performed to evaluate the on
board stability of the Reagent Integral. Reagent Integrals stored (after
opening) in the refrigerator at 2-8°C or ‘on board’ the LIAISON® Analyzer.
Stability testing was performed in accordance with the recognized standard
EN 13640:2001.
Two Reagents Integrals (of the same kit lot) were opened, seals removed and
calibrated. One was then left on board the instrument, in the refrigerated area
(12-19°C), for 63 days, while the other was stored in the refrigerator at 2-8°C.
At regular intervals, the on board kit performance was evaluated in parallel
with the kit stored at 2-8°C by testing the coded panel according to the
package insert’s instructions for use. Calibration was performed every four
weeks. The obtained data demonstrated that, opened LIAISON® Rubella IgG
Reagent Integrals are stable for at least 63 days when left on-board the
LIAISON® Analyzer. The claim of eight (8) weeks on-board stability is stated
in the package insert.

Calibration Stability:
One lot of kit was used and Reagent Integrals were opened and seals removed.
The calibration was performed, the coded panel was tested, and then the
Integral was left on board the instrument in the refrigerated area (12-19°C).
Every 7 days the same samples were tested, according to the package insert’s
instructions for use, using the opened Integral and the initial assay calibration.
This study continued for 35 days.
Calibration stability was considered acceptable because tested coded panel
were correctly classified. Therefore the %CV of the sample results calculated
across days is comparable to the acceptance criteria.
A second test was performed using an opened Integral and stored in the
refrigerator at 2-8°C. The %CVs of the sample results calculated across days
are comparable to the acceptance criteria.
Calibration is considered stable for a minimum of 28 days. The claim of four
(4) weeks calibration stability is stated in the package insert.
Open Controls Stability:
One lot of LIAISON® Rubella IgG Tri-Controls was used in this study. One
of each level of control vial was opened, tested and stored during a 35 day
period. Every 7 days, the opened vials and a freshly opened vial were tested in
parallel using opened and stored on board Integrals.
Index values were calculated with calibration at time zero. Open control
stability was considered acceptable because %CV of results calculated across
days is comparable to the expected between run precision and no significant
differences on doses were observed between already opened vials and freshly
opened ones, therefore the controls are considered stable for 28 days. The
claim of four (4) weeks opened vial stability is stated in the Instruction for
Use.
Freeze/Thaw Study:
A dedicated fresh sera panel was collected and tested the same morning after
collection. The specimens were classified as follows: two high negative
samples; four borderline samples; four low positive samples; two moderate to
high positive samples. Each sample was cycled through five freeze-thaws and
aliquots of sample representing each freeze-thaw cycle were re-tested in a
single run with one LIAISON® Rubella IgG kit lot. The %CV on doses of the
sample results was calculated across freeze/thaw cycles and found to be
consistent with the between-run precision. No sample showed any trend that
might suggest the influence of the freezing process on the assay result.

Cross-reactivity:
The cross-reactivity study for the LIAISON® Rubella IgG assay was designed
to evaluate potential interference from other organisms that may cause
symptoms similar to Rubella virus infection (VZV, Measles, Mumps), other
organisms that may cause infectious disease (HAV, HBV, HCV, HIV, CMV,
HSV, EBV, Toxoplasma gondii, Parvovirus, Treponema pallidum) and from
other conditions that may result from atypical immune system activity
(hypergammaglobulin, antinuclear autoantibodies, Rheumatoid Factor).
Samples for these studies were pre-screened with another commercially
available Rubella IgG assay. If found negative for Rubella IgG antibodies the
samples were used to study potential cross-reactivity. The presence of IgG
antibodies to the potential cross-reactants in the samples was confirmed using
FDA-cleared assays.

HAMA was not established. The user is responsible for establishing cross-
reactivity performance with these antibodies.
Interference:
The DiaSorin LIAISON® Rubella IgG assay was evaluated for interference
according to CLSI Document EP7. A panel of 12 samples with rubella Index
values ranging from 0.61 to 19.4 were tested with two levels each of
hemoglobin (500 and 1000 mg/dL), bilirubin (10 and 20 mg/dL) and
triglycerides (500 and 3000 mg/dL). None of the interferents at the levels

The paired-T test was applied to each potentially interfering substance study
and showed no significant difference in terms of Index among samples both
for negative and positive specimens.
Human Serum Albumin:
The spiking of 12 samples with serum albumin (up to 1.7 g/dL) showed no
significant difference in terms of Index among samples when comparing
results from the original samples with those after the addition of serum
albumin in order to reach the higher level.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off for the LIAISON® Rubella IgG assay (index = 1) was set at 10
IU/mL based on the 1st International Standard for anti-Rubella
Immunoglobulin, Human (1997) in accordance to the CLSI guideline I/LA6-A
(1997). In order to determine the accuracy of the assay’s cutoff, an analysis of
the cumulative frequency distributions (ROC curve) was performed,
according to the CLSI guidance document GP10-A, on the LIAISON® Rubella
IgG assay results for the 1989 positive and 90 negative samples to assess the
assay’s cutoff. The relevant cumulative frequency distribution graph was
generated by calculating relative class frequencies of the expected positive
results from the expected negative sample results and comparing their patterns
to visualize if the assay was designed to guarantee the required cutoff value.
The assay’s cut-off was set in accordance to the CLSI Guideline and evaluated
on the observed results to guarantee the best levels of specificity, without
compromising the sensitivity. The analysis of the data determined that the cut-

off at an Index value of 1.0 guaranteed the best sensitivity and specificity
balance. A grey zone of - 10% of the cutoff was selected due to observed
assay imprecision. Therefore, in the LIAISON® Rubella IgG assay, a sample
is defined as positive if the Index value is equal to or greater than 1.0, and
defined as negative if the Index value is lower than 0.90. Samples with results
between 0.90 and 1.0 are classified as equivocal.
WHO Calibration:
The international preparation (i.e. RUBI-1-94 - NIBSC 1st International
Standard for anti-Rubella Immunoglobulin, Human - 1997) was used to
prepare a dilution curve in serum matrix to cover the assay range. The points
were tested in three replicates each for three days, 2 runs per day by two
different lots. The analytical sensitivity was based on a dilution curve plotted
with the mean of each standard point, and on this curve the cut-off dose was
calculated by interpolation. A linear regression of the LIAISON® Rubella IgG
result versus the calculated WHO standard concentration of each dilution was
used to determine the assay result at the cut-off. The mean cut-off level
corresponds to a level of the WHO 1st International Standard of 9.42 IU/mL.
Regression analysis of these results with the calculated WHO rubella IgG
concentration was evaluated. Linear regression of WHO doses (IU/mL) vs.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance Requirements: All discordant equivocal results were tallied
against the investigational device. A consensus approach, with the possibility
of using two out of three FDA cleared predicates to reach consensus for
comparison was implemented. The “Routine/General Population Cohort” and
the “Pregnant Women Cohort” were segregated as distinctive target
populations to assess performance of the test. According to special controls
requirements a 95% point estimate for positive and negative agreement was
requested on each of the populations, as well as the need to satisfy the
requirements of containing 50 low positive, 50 high positive and 100 negative
specimens in the whole study.
The performance of the LIAISON®Rubella IgG assay was determined by
percent agreement among negative samples and percent agreement among

positive samples, with reference method in specific populations. The relevant
95% confidence limits were computed by applying the exact method.
All specimens were tested for the presence of Rubella IgG antibodies using
the LIAISON® Rubella IgG assay and a predicate. Three FDA cleared devices
were chosen as the additional methods to test the predicate device equivocal
samples. The classification of samples equivocal by the predicate device was
reassigned based on the consensus of the combined 2 out of 3 results from the
three ELISA results, i.e. a sample with concordant result by at least two of the
three methods was defined following the consensus. If the results by the three
methods were either discordant among themselves or equivocal by consensus,
the sample was classified as equivocal.
Specimens that were equivocal by both, the LIAISON® Rubella IgG assay and
the consensus from the three ELISA tests were not included in the percent
agreement calculation. Positive or negative results from the LIAISON®
Rubella IgG assay were considered as non-agreements in the calculation of
percent positive agreement and percent negative agreement when the
corresponding comparator method result was equivocal. Comparison method:
compared number of samples positive on both tests to sum of all positive
samples on the reference method + samples equivocal on the comparator
method and negative on the LIAISON® Rubella IgG. Compared number of
samples negative on both tests to sum of all negative samples on the reference
method + samples equivocal on the comparator method and positive on the
LIAISON® Rubella IgG.

individuals referred to the lab for rubella testing, with the exception of
pregnant women. These populations were separated because of current
medical practice for rubella referrals, and since pregnancy may have an effect
on the results of this IgG test.
A total of 2806 prospectively collected frozen specimens were tested in the
study using four different US testing sites. Of these, 2608 were from non-
selected subjects: 2159 subjects sent to the laboratory for routine rubella IgG
testing and 449 pregnant women. Samples were divided randomly and the
testing sites were blinded to samples’ populations and comparator results prior
to LIAISON® testing. Given the lack of statistical power to properly assess the
pregnant women negative agreement an unbiased analysis of 100 pre-selected
samples was performed as shown below. Of the 2,806 specimens, 198
negative pre-selected subjects were tested: 98 subjects sent to the laboratory
for routine Rubella IgG testing and 100 pregnant women tested for Rubella
antibodies as part of their routine pre-natal care. (All samples were collected
in the U.S. except for the 100 pre-selected negative pregnant women, which
were a population from Italy.) The rubella antibody testing performed by the
laboratories was used to define the samples as negative. All of the specimens
were tested for the presence of Rubella IgG antibodies using the LIAISON®
Rubella IgG assay and a FDA cleared rubella chemiluminescence test kit. All
tests were performed in a blinded fashion to the testing site, not knowing the
expected results and mixing together prospective specimens with pre-selected
negative samples. Three FDA cleared devices were chosen as the additional
methods to test the predicate device equivocal samples. No equivocal results
were found in the initial predicate test of the 100 pregnant women, hence there
was no need for consensus result to be performed on this cohort. The
following tables compare the results obtained for the LIAISON® Rubella IgG
assay and commercially available Rubella tests.
Additional pre-selected negative Pregnant Women study: The original
pregnant women study contained 217 specimens and showed a negative
agreement of 66.6% (2/3). Unable to ascertain performance based on this
result, an additional study with negative pregnant women (at least 100, tested
together with at least a 20% of the total number being positive results (100
negatives + X positives) was requested. The sponsor collected 100 pregnant
retrospective specimens from 2 sites in Italy, and an additional 232
prospective pregnant specimens (unknown rubella status) from US. All of
them were tested together in a blinded fashion. The prospective specimens
were subsequently presented pooled with the original pregnant cohort; the
retrospective pre-selected negatives were presented in a separate table (see
below).

Expected Values
The LIAISON® Rubella IgG assay was tested with prospectively collected
specimens from U.S. subjects routinely sent to the laboratory for rubella IgG
testing (n=2159) and from pregnant women (n=449) to evaluate the assay’s
performance in these populations. Of the 2159 samples sent to the laboratory for
routine rubella IgG testing, 91.7% were positive. Of the 449 pregnant women
samples, 96.4% were positive. The distribution of results for IgG antibodies to
rubella in these populations as determined by the LIAISON® Rubella IgG assay is
