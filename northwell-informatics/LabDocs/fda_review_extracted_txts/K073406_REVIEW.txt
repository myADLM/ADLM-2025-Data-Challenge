(16/304) μg/mL on the VITEK®2 Gram Negative Susceptibility Cards for use
with the VITEK®2 Systems in clinical laboratories as an in vitro test to determine
the susceptibility of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species,
Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella flexneri, and
Shigella sonnei to antimicrobial agents when used as instructed in the Online
Product Information.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable
I. Device Description:
The VITEK® 2 AST card containing the test is inoculated with a standardized
organism suspension. The card is incubated within the instrument and optically
monitored throughout the incubation cycle. Results are automatically calculated once a
predetermined growth threshold is reached and a report is generated that contains the
final result.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S17) “Methods for
Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
Each VITEK®2 test card contains 64 microwells. A control well, that contains only
microbiological culture medium is resident on all cards, with the remaining wells
containing premeasured amounts of a specific antibiotic combined with culture medium.
A suspension of organism is made in 0.45-0.5% sterile saline from a pure culture and
standardized to a McFarland 0.5 standard using the DensiChek. The desired cards are
placed in the cassette along with an empty tube for the susceptibility card. The cassette is
placed in the VITEK®2 instrument where a susceptibility test will be automatically
diluted from the ID suspension by the VITEK®2. The cards are then automatically
vacuum filled; the tubes are cut and the cards sealed prior to proceeding to the Incubator
Loading Station. Cards are then transferred from the cassette into the carousel for
incubation at 35.5o C, and optical scanning during testing. Readings are performed every
15 minutes.
In addition to the automatic dilution, there is also a manual inoculation dilution

procedure described in the packager insert. VITEK®2 results for
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is reported as the sum of the concentrations of the two
antibiotics.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Ten gram-negative on-scale organisms were tested at three sites in
triplicate in three days with >95% reproducibility. This testing was performed
using both the manual dilution and the automatic dilution method.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC isolates, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa were tested on
every test occasion with the reference method and the VITEK®2. The reference
method QC results were in range for every day tested. The VITEK®2 was tested
a sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the system can produce QC
results in the recommended range.
Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the auto-
dilution and the manual method of diluting the organisms. Results demonstrated
that methods were comparable.

A clinical study was conducted at three sites using the VITEK®2 cards with
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and the CLSI reference agar dilution method
prepared as recommended by CLSI. Inoculum was prepared with direct colony
suspension. Two methods of inoculation, manual and automated, were evaluated.
Clinical testing was performed using the automated method of inoculation and the
challenge set was tested using both the manual and the automated method.

Greater than 90% of the isolates grew in the VITEK®2 cards in less than 16
hours. Essential agreement was not calculated because the VITEK®2 card
contained <5 dilutions of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. A comparison was
provided to the reference method with the following agreement.

Category Agreement is when the interpretation (SIR) of the reference method agrees
exactly with the interpretation (SIR) of the VITEK®2 results. Minor errors are not
possible since there is no intermediate category.
Manual Dilution:
The challenge set of organisms was also tested at one site using the manual method of
inoculation with the following performance that demonstrated that there is no
difference between the two inoculation methods.
