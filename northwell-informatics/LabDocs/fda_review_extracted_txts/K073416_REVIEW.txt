the sample reacts with glucose oxidase (GOD) and Hexaammineruthenium (III) chloride in
the test strip. This produces Hexaammineruthenium (II) chloride. Hexaammineruthenium (II)
chloride is produced in proportion to the glucose concentration of the blood sample.
Oxidation of the Hexaammineruthenium (II) chloride produces an electric current. The meter
converts the current to the glucose concentration and displays it as the test result.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Analysis was performed using fresh venous whole blood obtained from 6 non-diabetic
volunteers. Glucose concentrations in the whole blood were adjusted to obtain 6 glucose
concentrations encompassing the 30-600 mg/dL range following CLSI EP5-A.
Within-Day precision tests consisted of twenty replicates of each of the six whole blood
glucose samples. The Within-Day precision tests were performed within 4 hours of
collection of the venous blood sample in each case, with exception of the very low blood
glucose sample, which was permitted to undergo glycolysis with time to achieve a
glucose level within the 30-50 mg/dL range. This, however, did not exceed 6 hours. The
YSI 2300 reference blood glucose analyzer was used to obtain the target blood glucose
values. Between-Day precision testing involved performing the same test over a period of
six days. Three (3) separate Lots of test strips were tested.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To assess the linearity range of the device, testing was performed using venous whole
blood collected in a 10mL vacuum sample tube. Glucose was adjusted to 11
concentration levels ranging from 13 mg/dL to 712 mg/dL. Five 01 Meter
measurements were performed at each glucose concentration. This process was
repeated at three temperatures (10, 25, and 40 degrees centigrade). The five 01
Meter measurements were averaged and bias was calculated against the GA-1150
reference analyzer.
The regression equations were as follows:
10ºC: y = 1.0838x - 19.04 with an R2 value of 0.9972
25ºC: y = 1.0097x - 3.3104 with an R2 value of 0.9975
40ºC: y = 1.0032x - 7.7337 with an R2 value of 0.9964
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The traceability for the Control Solution Glucose Assignment is described relating
directly to the Hitachi Hexokinase reference, traceable to NIST Solution SRM 917a
(Hexokinase Calibrator) and SRM 917b (Reference Standard).
Shelf life studies show that the unopened test strips have an 18 month life-span and 3
months shelf-life once a vial of strips is opened. Unopened controls have an 18-month

d. Detection limit:
The detection limit is 20 mg/dL. See linearity/assay reportable range section above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Hematocrit: A study was conducted to evaluate hematocrit interference at high
hematocrit levels. All blood was fully oxygenated and adjusted to eight concentration
levels (34, 52, 73, 121, 195, 264, 334, 528 mg/dL) and five hematocrit levels (30, 33,
36, 42, 50, 53, 54 and 55%). Table 1 summarizes the average percent bias deviation
at each glucose level and each upper hematocrit level.

The data for samples between 30 and 54% hematocrit were within ±15% and support
a claim of 30%-54% hematocrit range.
Interference Testing:
Interfering substances were dissolved in venous blood at several concentrations each,
then these were divided into three aliquots and spiked to nominal glucose
concentrations of 60 mg/dL, 120 mg/dL or 320 mg/dL. These samples were tested
against control samples which had a blank solvent added at the same volume as the
interferent. Samples were tested n =10 and the percent difference of the interfering
samples were calculated compared to control samples. The following substances were
tested.

glucose concentrations ranging from approximately 56 to 540 mg/dL. One aliquot of
each sample was tested on the ground at 900 feet above sea level and the other was
tested at 10,000 ±20 feet in a small non pressurized airplane. The result of each
sample tested at 10,000 feet was within ±10% of the sample tested on the ground.
This demonstrates that the meter may be used up to an altitude of 10,000 feet above
sea level.
Temperature and humidity studies were performed and showed that the meter can be
used at temperatures from 50°F to 104°F and at relative humidity ranging from 20%
to 80%.

2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with the capillary whole blood. Since the whole blood
is applied directly to the test strip, there are no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
The meter automatically detects the code number when a test strip is inserted. The user
must check to see if the code number the meter displays matches the number on the test
strip vial. If the number matches, the user is instructed to begin testing. If the number
does not match, or if no number appears, the user is instructed to try another test strip. If
this fails the user is instructed to try a new vial of strips and to call customer service if
this also fails. No other calibration is required from the user.
6. Quality Control:
One control level is provided with the device and two additional control levels are
available. The user is instructed to call their supplier or pharmacy to obtain controls and
to call Arkray customer service if the supplier or pharmacy does not stock the controls.
The user is instructed to run controls when the meter is first used in order to verify that
they can use the meter correctly. In addition they are instructed to run a control when a
new vial of test strips is opened, when they suspect the meter or strips are not working
correctly, when test results are not consistent with the patient’s symptoms or the patient
does not think the results are accurate, if the meter is dropped, to check their technique, if
the test strip bottle had been left open or stored outside its recommended temperature
range, or when the Glucocard X-Meter has been stored outside its recommended
temperature range. The acceptable results ranges are shown on the test strip vial label. If
the results are outside the expected range, the user is instructed to repeat the test. If the
repeated test falls outside the range the user is instructed to repeat the test using a new
control solution or test strip. If the control continues to read outside the expected range
the user is told not to use the test system until the control result reads within the
acceptable range.
