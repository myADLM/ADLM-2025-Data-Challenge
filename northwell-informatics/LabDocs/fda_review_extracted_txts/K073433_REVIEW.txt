determination of antimicrobial susceptibility by minimal inhibitory
concentration (MIC) of most gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic
bacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae and non –
Enterobacteriaceae.
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is intended for the in
vitro quantitative determination of antimicrobial susceptibility by minimal
inhibitory concentration (MIC) of most gram-negative aerobic and facultative
anaerobic bacteria isolates from pure culture for Enterobacteriaceae and non-
Enterobacteriaceae and most Gram-positive bacteria isolates from pure
culture belonging to the genera Staphylococcus and Enterococcus.
2. Indication(s) for use:
This submission is for the new formulation the antibiotic Piperacillin at
concentrations of 2 - 128 µg/mL with the request for the removal of
limitations of reporting Proteus mirabilis, Providencia species, and
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia to the Gram Negative ID/AST or AST only
Phoenix™ panel.
Piperacillin has been shown to be active in vitro and in clinical
infections against: Acinetobacter species, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli,
Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and Serratia spp.; and active in vitro against Burkholderia
cepacia, Citrobacter diversus, Citrobacter freundii, Stenotrophomonas
maltophilia and Yersinia enterocolitica.
Special condition for use statement
Results for Proteus vulgaris/penneri with the new formulation of Piperacillin
have been excluded in the BD Phoenix™; therefore no results will be
reported. An alternate method should be performed when this combination is
identified.
The truncation for reporting Morganella morganii with the new formulation
of Piperacillin has been removed. The truncation for reporting
Achromobacter species (4 – 128 µg/mL) has been retained.
Prescription Use Only
3. Special instrument Requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
This submission is for the AST Panel only. The ID System was not reviewed.
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells

containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for AST
Indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth,
and equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD
CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST broth, which
contains an AST indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST broth is a cation-
adjusted broth containing Tween 80. After adding the indicator solution to the AST
inoculum, the color is blue, and after inoculation and incubation, it changes to pink
then colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds. Inoculated panels are barcode
scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System
instrument where the panels are continuously incubated at 35°C. The resulting AST
has a final inoculum of 5 x 105 CFU/ml. The instrument incubates, reads and records
the results of the biochemical substrates and antimicrobial agents and interprets the
reactions to give a MIC value and category interpretation of the antimicrobial agents.
Organisms growing in the presence of a given antimicrobic agent reduce the
indicator, signaling organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobic agent.
Organisms killed or inhibited by a given antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the
indicator and therefore do not produce a color change. Additional interpretation is
done using software driven “EXPERT” System using rules derived from the Clinical
and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) documentation. Readings are taken every
20 minutes with an ID result available between 2-12 hours and an AST result
available between 4-16 hours. This is only an autoread result; there are no manual
readings possible.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The previous premarket notification for Piperacillin in the BD
Phoenix Automated Microbiology Systems (K041572) contained
truncations applied to Morganella morganii and Achromobacter
species (4 – 128 µg /ml) due to lower than expected EA, and a “Do
Not Report” limitation for Proteus species, Providencia species and
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia due to overall performance that did
not meet acceptance criteria. This submission is for the evaluation
of reformulated Piperacillin at concentrations of 2 - 128 µg/ml to
establish performance and to remove the truncation for Morganella

morganii and on Achromobacter species, and to remove the
limitation for Proteus mirabilis, Providencia species and
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Results for Proteus
vulgaris/penneri with the new formulation of Piperacillin have been
excluded in the BD Phoenix™; therefore no results will be reported.
An alternate method should be performed when this combination is
identified. Other clinical and challenge organism groups were tested
simultaneously. The broth dilution reference panel was prepared
according to the CLSI recommendation and used to compare with
the Phoenix™ results.
Clinical testing was performed at four sites. The testing included a
total of 1169 isolates of which 293 were Challenge isolates with
known results, and 876 were Clinical isolates. These clinical isolates
were comprised of 617 (70.4%) fresh isolates, 209 (23.9%) recent
isolates and 50 (5.7%) stock isolates. Due to overall performance
that was lower than expected, the AST results for Piperacillin with
Proteus vulgaris/penneri will continue to be suppressed from
reporting by the Phoenix system. When this report group is removed
from the data set, the overall number of tests analyzed for
performance decreases from 1169 to 1151 (6 clinical isolates, 12
challenge isolates).
Performance charts below include all original data, and additional
data for fresh and challenge organisms tested against the
reformulated Piperacillin.

EA-Essential Agreement maj-major discrepancies
CA-Category Agreement vmj-very major discrepancies
R-resistant isolates min- minor discrepancies
Essential agreement (EA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panels agree with the
reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the
reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the BD Phoenix™
panel (SIR) result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel
(SIR) result interpretation. Evaluable EA (Eval EA) is when the MIC
result is on scale for both the BD Phoenix and the reference method, and
have on-scale EA.
The Clinical isolates performance EA was 95.3%, the Eval EA was 89.2% and the
CA was 94.5%. There were 6 maj (6/596, 1.0%), 40 min (40/870, 4.6%) and 2
vmj (2/229, 0.9%). The Challenge set performance EA was 98.6%, the Evaluable
EA was 97.2% and the CA was 95.4%, which was very good. There were 2 vmj
out of 162 resistant isolates, and there were 2 maj out of 105 susceptible isolates.
There were 9 minor errors (9/281, 3.2%).
The overall combined EA was 96.1%, the Evaluable EA was 90.6% and the CA
was 94.7%. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia had a lower than expected CA or
87.5%, however, the EA was 93.8% and there were no vmj or maj generated.
One of the two min was within EA. The new formulation of PIP did not generate
any additional vmj. Therefore, the performance data are acceptable.
The test device had a growth rate of >95% .

N. Proposed Labeling:
The expected value range, interpretive criteria and QC for gram negative panels are
included in the package insert. The performance data presented are acceptable for the
new formulation of Piperacillin with the removal of truncation for Morganella
morganii, and removal of limitations for Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp., and
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Results for Proteus vulgaris/penneri with the new
formulation of Piperacillin have been excluded in the BD Phoenix™; therefore no
results will be reported. An alternate method should be performed when this
combination is identified. The truncation for Achromobacter species (drug dilution of
4 – 128 µg/mL) has been retained.
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
a substantial equivalence decision.
