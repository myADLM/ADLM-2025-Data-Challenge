1. Intended use(s):
System reagent for the quantitative determination of IgM immunoglobulins in
human serum and plasma on OLYMPUS analyzers
2. Indication(s) for use:
The spectrum of abnormalities in serum immunoglobulin concentration is broad.
Abnormal concentrations range from a virtual absence of one or more of the three
major classes of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG and IgM) to polyclonal increases in
one or more immunoglobulins. Measurement of these immunoglobulins aids in
the diagnosis of abnormal protein metabolism and the body’s lack of ability to
resist infectious agents.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
OLYMPUS analyzers: AU400/400e, 600/640/640e and 2700/5400
I. Device Description:
The device consists of two reagents: R1 buffer (Tris buffer pH 7.2, polyethylene
glycol 6000) and R2 (goat anti-IgM antiserum). The reagents contain sodium azide
as preservative.

L. Test Principle:
When a sample is mixed with R1 buffer and R2 antiserum solution, human IgM
reacts specifically with anti-human IgM antibodies to yield insoluble aggregates.
Immune complexes formed in solution scatter light in proportion to their size, shape
and concentration. The Olympus analyzer measures the decrease in intensity of light
transmitted (increase in absorbance) through particles suspended in solution as a
result of complexes formed during the antigen-antibody reaction.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Assays of 3 human serum pools (high, low and medium) were assayed in
duplicate for 2 runs per day for 20 days (n=80) on the AU400/400e,
AU600/640/640e, and AU2700/5400. The acceptance criteria for the within-
run and total %CV were <4.2% and <10% respectively. The within-run
precision covering the instrument platforms ranged from 1.12–2.19% and the
total precision ranged from 2.60-4.08%.

Auto dilution:
To validate the accuracy and precision of automated sample dilution protocol, three
auto-dilution samples were diluted manually and run on the instrument. The same
samples were diluted automatically by the AU640. Accuracy (%difference) and
precision (%CV) were determined.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The measuring range for the assay is 20-500 mg/dL. The procedure used to
determine linearity was based on CLSI EP6-A. A series of at least ten analyte
concentrations, covering the linear dynamic range was prepared by dilution of
a high pool sample. Each dilution was assayed in quadruplicate and the mean
analytical results were plotted versus the relative analyte concentrations (%
dilution). Studies were performed on the AU400, AU640 and AU2700
analyzers. The acceptance criteria for deviation from regression line for the
20-80 mg/dL and 80-500 mg/dL ranges were ± 8 mg/dL and ± 10%
respectively. The studies showed the assay was linear from 20-500 mg/dL.
Hook effect may occur with highly elevated IgM samples >10,000 mg/dL,
polyclonal.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrator is traceable to the International Reference Preparation CRM470
(US designation RPPHS lot 91/0619).
Reagent on-board stability was demonstrated according to internal procedures
where the linearity displayed at day 90 and the % drift from Day 0 from
control recovery were calculated. A change of ≤ 10% was demonstrated over
the 90 days.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the new assay was determined by testing
3 patient pools, 40 fold at an analyte concentration below the lower end of the
measuring range on the AU400, AU640 and AU2700. The analyte level with
a CV of less than 20% was determined to be <10 mg/dL. This was
determined using a method based on the CLSI protocol EP17-A.

The Limit of Detection (LoD) or the concentration of analyte which is
significantly different from zero was determined by testing an analyte free
sample twenty-fold on the AU400, AU640 and AU2700. LoD was calculated
as the absolute mean + 3SD and the lowest detectable level was determined to
be ≤ 2 mg/dL.
