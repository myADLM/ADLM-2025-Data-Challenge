L. Test Principle:
This method is based on the reaction of a sample containing human apo B and a
specific antiserum to form an insoluble complex which can be measured
turbidimetrically at 340 nm. The concentration of apo B can be determined by
comparing sample results to a standard curve constructed from the absorbances of
standards.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the Diazyme Apolipoprotein B assay was evaluated, according to
CLSI EP5-A, in a study, using three levels of serum specimens containing low,
medium and high levels of Apo B. They were tested with 2 runs per day in
duplicates over 10 working days.
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3
Serum Testing 24 mg/dL Apo B 100 mg/dL 155 mg/dL Apo
Apo B B
Std. Deviation 3.6 mg/dL 15 mg/dL 23.25 mg/dL
Within-Run CV% = 1.4% CV% = 1.4% CV% = 1.2%
Precision
Total Precision CV% = 4.8% CV% = 3.9% CV% = 2.1%
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed measuring range of this device is 25- 160 mg/dL. Eleven levels
of samples were prepared in triplicate by diluting a serum control containing
157 mg/dL Apo B with saline according to CLSI EP6-A guidelines. Linear
Regression analysis results obtained were as follows: Slope = 0.988, Intercept
= 1.203 with an R2 = 0.9992.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrator and Control Stability: The ApoB calibrator stability testing was
performed in real time at 4◦C, and as accelerated stability studies at 25◦C and

37◦C using two lots of the calibrator. Real-time stability tests are ongoing.
Calibrator Traceability: The Calibrator is traceable to WHO/IFCC standards.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection studies were performed following CLSI EP17-A. Five (5)
serum samples containing low ApoB were diluted 100X with 7.5% BSA in
saline and tested with the ApoB reagent on the Hitachi 917 with 12 replicates
each (a total of 60 measurements). The results are summarized as follows:
LoD = LoB + (1.645 * SD Low Samples) = 3.60 + (1.645 * 0.5556) = 3.60 +
0.91= 4.51mg/dL
The LOD of the Diazyme ApoB assay was determined to be 4.51 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed per CLSI guideline EP7-A. The following
compounds were tested up to the concentrations detailed below with normal
serum (containing 70 mg/dL of ApoB). There was ≤ ± 10% deviation in the
observed concentration of ApoB.
Interference Substance Concentration
Ascorbic Acid 10 mM
Bilirubin 40 mg/dL
Bilirubin Conjugated 40 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 1000 mg/dL
Triglycerides 1000 mg/dL
Apolipoprotein A-1 500 mg/dL
Further, there was no cross-reactivity observed with Apo A-1 when tested up
to a concentration of 500 mg/dL.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The individual patient serum samples used for this study were from a certified
commercial source and the assay was performed on a Hitachi 917 analyzer.
To ensure the concentrations of Apo B were distributed across the reportable
dynamic range claimed, additional Apo B samples were spiked with Apo B to
achieve higher concentrations, or diluted with saline to reach lower
concentrations. A total of 55 unaltered and 7 altered serum samples were used
for the comparison experiment. The comparison results between the Diazyme
Apolipoprotein B assay and the Kamiya Apo B reagent are summarized
below:
For a total of 62 serum samples ranging from 29.6 to 241.1 mg/dL Apo B, the
correlation coefficient between the two methods was 0.9864; the slope was
1.0143; and y intercept was -4.3806.
