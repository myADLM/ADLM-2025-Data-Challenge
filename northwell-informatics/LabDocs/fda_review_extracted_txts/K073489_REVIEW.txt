1. Intended use(s):
System reagent for the quantitative determination of IgA immunoglobulins in
human serum and plasma on OLYMPUS analyzers
2. Indication(s) for use:
The spectrum of abnormalities in serum immunoglobulin concentration is broad.
Abnormal concentrations range from a virtual absence of one or more of the three
major classes of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG and IgM) to polyclonal increases in
one or more immunoglobulins. Measurement of these immunoglobulins aids in
the diagnosis of abnormal protein metabolism and the body’s lack of ability to
resist infectious agents.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
OLYMPUS analyzers: AU400/400e, 600/640/640e and 2700/5400
I. Device Description:
The device consists of two reagents: R1 buffer (Tris buffer pH 7.2, polyethylene
glycol 6000) and R2 (goat anti-IgA antiserum). The reagents contain sodium azide as
preservative.

When a sample is mixed with R1 buffer and R2 antiserum solution, human IgA reacts
specifically with anti-human IgA antibodies to yield insoluble aggregates. Immune
complexes formed in solution scatter light in proportion to their size, shape and
concentration. The Olympus analyzer measures the decrease in intensity of light
transmitted (increase in absorbance) through particles suspended in solution as a
result of complexes formed during the antigen-antibody reaction.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Assays of three human serum pools (low, medium and high) sera were
performed in duplicate 2 runs per day for 20 days (n=80) on the AU400/400e,
AU600/640/640e, and AU2700/5400. The acceptance criteria for within-run
and total precision were <4.2% and <10% respectively. The within-run
precision covering the platforms ranged from 1.05–2.18% and the total
precision ranged from 1.50-4.01%.

To validate the accuracy and precision of automated sample dilution protocol,
three auto-dilution samples were diluted manually and run on the instrument.
The same samples were diluted automatically by the AU640. Accuracy
(%difference) and precision (%CV) were determined.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The measuring range for the assay is 10-700 mg/dL. The procedure used to
demonstrate linearity was based on CLSI EP6-A. A series of at least ten
analyte concentrations, covering the linear dynamic range were prepared by
dilution of a high pool sample. Each dilution was assayed in quadruplicate
and the mean analytical results were plotted versus the relative analyte
concentrations (% dilution). Studies were performed on the AU400, AU640
and AU2700 analyzers. The acceptance criteria for deviation from the
regression line for the 10-40 mg/dL and 40-700 mg/dL ranges were ± 4 mg/dL
and ± 10% respectively. The studies showed the assay was linear from 10-
700 mg/dL. There was no high dose hook effect up to 10,000 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrator is traceable to the International Reference Preparation CRM470
(US designation RPPHS lot 91/0619).
Calibration frequency:
The calibration stability period change from 7 days to 90 days was validated
during the on-board reagent stability studies. Linearity and in-house control
recovery were checked after 90 days of reagent storage. The linearity is
displayed at day 90 and the %drift from Day 0 from control recovery (with
calibration at day 0) was calculated. Results were acceptable.
Reagent on-board stability was demonstrated according to internal procedures
where the linearity displayed at day 90 and the % drift from Day 0 from
control recovery were calculated. A change of ≤ 10% was demonstrated over
the 90 days.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the new assay was determined by testing

3 patient pools, 40 fold at an analyte concentration below the lower end of the
measuring range on the AU400, AU640 and AU2700. The analyte level at
which a CV of less than 20% was determined to be <10 mg/dL. This was
determined using a method based on the CLSI protocol EP17-A.

The Limit of Detection (LoD) or the concentration of analyte which is
significantly different from zero was determined by testing an analyte free
sample twenty-fold on the AU400, AU640 and AU2700. LoD was calculated
as the absolute mean + 3SD. The lowest detectable level was determined to
be ≤1 mg/dL.
