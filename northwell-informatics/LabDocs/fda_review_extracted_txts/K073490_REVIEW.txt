(G, A, M) Immunological Test
System
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
System reagent for the quantitative determination of IgG immunoglobulins in
human serum and plasma on OLYMPUS analyzers
2. Indication(s) for use:
The spectrum of abnormalities in serum immunoglobulin concentration is broad.
Abnormal concentrations range from a virtual absence of one or more of the three
major classes of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG and IgM) to polyclonal increases in
one or more immunoglobulins. Measurement of these immunoglobulins aids in
the diagnosis of abnormal protein metabolism and the body’s lack of ability to
resist infectious agents.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
OLYMPUS analyzers: AU400/400e, 600/640/640e and 2700/5400
I. Device Description:
The device consists of two reagents: R1 buffer (Tris buffer pH 7.2, polyethylene
glycol 6000) and R2 (goat anti-IgM antiserum). The reagents contain sodium azide
as preservative.

L. Test Principle:
When a sample is mixed with R1 buffer and R2 antiserum solution, human IgG reacts
specifically with anti-human IgG antibodies to yield insoluble aggregates. Immune
complexes formed in solution scatter light in proportion to their size, shape and
concentration. The Olympus analyzer measures the decrease in intensity of light
transmitted (increase in absorbance) through particles suspended in solution as a
result of complexes formed during the antigen-antibody reaction.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Serum/Plasma
The measuring range for the assay is 75-3000 mg/dL. The procedure used to
demonstrate linearity was based on CLSI EP6-A. A series of at least ten
analyte concentrations, covering the linear dynamic range was prepared by
dilution of a high pool sample. Each dilution was assayed in quadruplicate
and the mean analytical results were plotted versus the relative analyte
concentrations (% dilution). Studies were performed on the AU400, AU640
and AU2700 analyzers. The acceptance criteria for deviation from the
regression line for 75-375 mg/dL and 375-3000 mg/dL ranges were ± 30
mg/dL and ± 8%. The studies showed the assay was linear from 75-3000
mg/dL. There was no high dose hook effect up to 30,000 mg/dL.
CSF
The measuring range for the assay is 2-50 mg/dL. The procedure used to
demonstrate linearity was based on CLSI EP6-A. A series of at least ten
analyte concentrations, covering the linear dynamic range was prepared by
dilution of a high pool sample. Each dilution was assayed in quadruplicate
and the mean analytical results were plotted versus the relative analyte
concentrations (% dilution). Studies were performed on the AU400, AU640
and AU2700 analyzers. The acceptance criteria for the deviation from the
regression line for 2-5 mg/dL and 5-50 mg/dL ranges were ± 0.5 mg/dL and ±
10% respectively. The studies showed the assay was linear from 2-50 mg/dL.
There was no high dose hook effect up to 6,000 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrator is traceable to the International Reference Preparation CRM470
(US designation RPPHS lot 91/0619).
Serum/Plasma
Reagent on-board stability was demonstrated according to internal procedures
where the linearity displayed at day 90 and the % drift from Day 0 from
control recovery were calculated. A change of ≤ 8% was demonstrated over
the 90 days. Data confirm the calibration stability of 90 days.

the 90 days. Data confirm the calibration stability of 2 days for CSF.
d. Detection limit:
Serum/Plasma
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the new assay was determined by testing
3 patient pools, 40 fold at an analyte concentration below the lower end of the
measuring range on the AU400, AU640 and AU2700. The analyte level with
a CV of less than 20% was determined to be <74 mg/dL. This was
determined using a method based on the CLSI protocol EP17-A.
Mean Concentration (mg/dL) CV (%)
AU400 33 16.8
AU640 35 6.6
AU2700 21 12.4
The Limit of Detection (LoD) or the concentration of analyte which is
significantly different from zero was determined by testing an analyte free
sample twenty-fold on the AU400, AU640 and AU2700. The lowest
detectable level was determined to be ≤7 mg/dL.
CSF
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the new assay (CSF) was determined by
testing 3 patient pools, 40 fold at an analyte concentration below the lower
end of the measuring range. The analyte level with a CV of less than 20%
was determined to be 2 mg/dL. This was determined using a method based on
the CLSI protocol EP17-A.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) or the concentration of analyte which is
significantly different from zero was determined by testing an analyte free
sample (water) twenty-fold on the AU400, AU640 and AU2700. The lowest
detectable level was determined to be ≤1 mg/dL.
