K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
• ISO 15197: In vitro diagnostic test systems - Requirements for blood-glucose
monitoring systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus
L. Test Principle:
Glucose measurement is based on electrochemical biosensor technology using the
enzyme glucose oxidase. The glucose in the sample is oxidized to produce gluconic
acid. The electrical current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured and
correlated to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is
proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample. The test strip is calibrated
to display the equivalent of plasma glucose values to allow comparison of results
with laboratory methods.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated within-day precision of the device using whole blood
samples spiked with five different glucose concentrations, tested using three test
strip lots and 10 glucose meters. All blood samples were maintained at hematocrit
level of approximately 42%. Each glucose concentration level was evaluated using

glucose range of 20 – 600 mg/dL. The samples were evaluated using three lots and
10 meters from each type of glucose meter, generating 10 values per glucose level.
The values generated were compared to YSI generated values. The linear regression
analysis of data generated is given in the table below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor claims that the only change made to the test strip compared to the
predicate was the shape of the electrodes. Based on the ongoing studies, the
sponsor demonstrated that there was <10% bias between the values generated for
five months at 40oC.
The control solutions supplied with the device were cleared under k052818.
There is an additional feature, the no coding feature, on the INFINITY model only,
which allows a single fixed-code number to be programmed into the meters at the
time of manufacturing.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor has established the measuring range of 20 - 600 mg/dL based on the
linearity studies for DIACHEX DETERMINE and DIACHEX INFINITY Blood
Glucose Monitoring Systems.
e. Analytical specificity:
Following CLSI EP7 guidelines, the sponsor tested the exogenous and endogenous
substances listed in the table below for interference at two glucose concentrations.
For each substance, one control sample (no interferent) and four test samples with
series of dilution concentrations were prepared. Each sample was measured at
glucose concentrations of approximately 60-80 mg/dL and 200-285 mg/dL
respectively. Results were averaged for the control samples (n=5) and for the four
parallel test samples (n=5). The mean difference between control and test samples
was calculated as: Glucose Difference (%) =100% x [Mean (Test Sample) – Mean
(Control)] / Mean (Control). Based on the interference limit of a mean glucose
difference of ± 10% of the glucose values obtained in the absence of interfering
substances, the following no interference levels were established by the sponsor.

The sponsor evaluated the effect of hematocrit levels between 29 – 59% on whole
blood samples spiked with 11 hematocrit levels at 4 levels of glucose distributed
within the measuring range (45 - 372 mg/dL) of the device. The mean values of the
6 replicated measurements generated were compared with the glucose values from
YSI 2300 analyzer. Based on the regression analysis, the results generated by the
device are comparable to the values of YSI-2300 instrument at hemtocrit levels
between 35-55%.
An altitude study was performed with whole blood samples from 20 volunteers
(glucose range: 68-157 mg/dL) at elevations of 164 feet, 5084 feet, 7545 feet, and
10168 feet. Altitude differences within individuals were within ±10mg/dL
deviation for glucose concentration of <75 mg/dL and ±15% deviation for glucose
concentration of ≥75 mg/dL. They also showed acceptable correlation (R2: 0.9803-
0.9990) based on the linear regression analysis.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor conducted accuracy studies to demonstrate that the DIACHEX
DETERMINE / DIACHEX INFINITY Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are
equivalent to a standard reference method (YSI-2300). Samples from 118
volunteers that included 13 contrived samples covering the lower (7 samples: 25.4-
49 mg/dL glucose) and upper (6 samples: 460-571 mg/dL glucose) ends of the
glucose measuring range were evaluated. The hematocrit levels of the 118 samples
ranged from 34-51%. All participants claimed to be in glucose steady state. Percent
distribution of the samples corresponding to the glucose concentration ranged as
follows: <50 mg/dL – 5.9%; 50-80 mg/dL – 13.6%; 80-120 mg/dL – 17.8%; 120-
200 mg/dL – 30.5%; 200- 300 mg/dL – 15.3%; 300-400 mg/dL – 10.2%; and >400
mg/dL – 6.8%. This test was conducted by a laboratory technician. Based on data
analysis, the device met the minimum system accuracy requirement established
according to the ISO 15197 guidelines, which is that 95% of the individual
differences are within ±15mg/dL when glucose concentration is less than 75mg/dL,
and within ±20% when glucose concentration >75mg/dL. Results of the linear
regression analysis are summarized in the table below.

Using DIACHEX DETERMINE meter, the sponsor conducted a second study to
demonstrate the accuracy of lay user testing for fingertip, palm and forearm. This
study included 112 lay users and 12 contrived samples covering the extreme ends
of the range (i.e. 33-48 mg/dL and 462-581 mg/dL). All participants claimed to be
in glucose steady state. Lay users were first requested to test the blood glucose
using the fingertip, the palm, and the forearm, followed by trained technicians
performing the fingertip test and YSI laboratory test. The values obtained were
compared with the values generated using YSI. Based on data analysis, the device
met the minimum system accuracy requirement established according to the ISO
15197 guidelines, which is that 95% of the individual differences are within
±15mg/dL when glucose concentration is less than 75mg/dL and within ±20%
when glucose concentration is >75mg/dL. Linear regression analysis of the lay user
and technician values compared with YSI values are summarized below.

N. Instrument Name:
DIACHEX DETERMINE and DIACHEX INFINITY Blood Glucose Monitoring
Systems
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional
readings.
2. Software:
FDA reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes
for this line of product types in k052818. Additionally, in this submission, the
sponsor provided data to support the accuracy of PC downloaded feature that
allows the user to download glucose meter readings to a personal computer. Only
the memory information within DETERMINE and INFINITY glucose meters can
be downloaded to PC through RS-232 port and can be cleared by software. The
sponsor also provided all Over The Shelf Software (OTSS) components and related
design validation verification and testing activities.
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, the
palm, and the forearm only. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the
test strip, there are no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
For DIACHEX DETERMINE, a code strip is provided with each batch of test
strips to calibrate the meter for that batch. No further calibrations are required of
the user. For DIACHEX INFINITY, a single calibration code is programmed into
the meters at the time of manufacturing.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at three different concentrations to be run with this
device are available for use but not supplied with the device. An acceptable range
for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is referred to

the troubleshooting section of the owner’s manual if control results fall outside
these ranges. There are three DIACHEX Control Solutions (Low, Normal, and
High) for each of the three meters that are available for the user to choose from.
The sponsor recommends the use of at least two controls solutions, normal with the
user’s choice of either high or low control solution to check the accuracy of the
system.
