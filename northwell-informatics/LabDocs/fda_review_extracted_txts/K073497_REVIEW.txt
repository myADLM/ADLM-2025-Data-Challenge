See Indications for Use
2. Indication(s) for use:
The EasyRA HDL Cholesterol reagent is intended for the quantitative
determination of High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol in human serum on the
Medica EasyRA Chemistry Analyzer. The Medica EasyRA HDL-Cholesterol
reagent can assist in the diagnosis and treatment of patients at risk of developing
coronary heart disease.
The EasyRA HDL Cholesterol calibrator is intended for the one point calibration
of the HDL reagent prior to patient serum sample analysis on the EasyRA clinical
chemistry analyzer.
For in vitro diagnostic use only. For professional use only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.

I. Device Description:
The Medica EasyRA HDL cholesterol reagent consists of two reagents, R1 and R2..
The direct assay method involves the removal of non-HDL lipoproteins via R1. The
second step of the assay involves R2 which contains a detergent which selectively
solubilizes HDL. HDL then reacts with a chromagen to develop a color at 600nm.
This device has been certified by the Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory
Network.

L. Test Principle:
Colorimetric Trinder reaction (Cholesterol Oxidase and Cholesterol Esterase)
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Total and within run precision were determined based upon CLSI EP5-A2. Three
levels of commercial serum based quality control material were tested on multiple
EasyRA analyzers (Level 1 and 2 on EasyRA #2, Easy RA #3 and Level 3 on
EasyRA #2, Easy RA #3, and analyzer 08011000).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity determination was based upon CLSI EP6-A and was performed
separately on two Medica EasyRA analyzers. Each level was measured in
duplicate. Nine samples were serially diluted from a level of 150 to 2 mg/dL.
The linerar regression results for analyzer 1 were y=1.0289x-1.1945,
r2=0.9999, and for analyzer 2 were y=1.0066x-0.8358, r2=0.9994.
The claimed reportable range of the assay is 2 – 150 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
Accelerated stability studies were performed using acceptable protocols for
on-board and shelf life stability. Real-time studies are on-going.
The stored stability (shelf-life) is 24 months and the on-board stability is 24
days when stored at 2 – 8oC.
The EasyRA HDL-Cholesterol calibrator was previously cleared under
k021316.
d. Detection limit:
Twenty replicates of water were analyzed on three EasyRA analyzers to
determine the Limit of Blank. A serum sample was prepared with a value
close to the lower measuring range of the assay. The sample was analyzed
twenty times on three EasyRA analyzers to determine performance with a low
concentration sample. The limit of a blank sample is 1.3 mg/dL. The low end
of the claimed measuring range is 2 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
To determine the level of interference from substances normally present in
human serum, the Medica EasyRA HDL-Cholesterol Assay was tested with
normal serum samples containing about 39 mg/dL HDL-C spiked with various
concentrations of potentially interfering substances following CLSI guideline
EP7-A on the Medica EasyRA Chemistry Analyzer. The following substances
normally present in serum produced less than 10% deviation when tested at
levels equal to the following concentrations:
Interference Substance Concentration
Bilirubin 32.50 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 500 mg/dL
Lipemia using Intralipid 1000 mg/dL

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 61 samples were tested on the device and compared with results on
the same samples tested using a predicate assay on the Cobas Mira. Samples
ranged from 2 to 148 mg/dL. The resulting regression statistics are as follows:
y = 0.93x+1.8, r2 = 0.9976. Samples within the clinically relevant range
between 2 and 80 mg/dL demonstrated linear regression results of y = 0.965x
+ 0.37, r2 = 0.9965.
