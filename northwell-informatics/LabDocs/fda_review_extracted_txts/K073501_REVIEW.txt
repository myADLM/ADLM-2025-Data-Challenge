I. Device Description:
The Elecsys Toxo IgG is a two-step sandwich immunoassay with streptavidin
microparticles and electrochemiluminescence detection. In the first incubation,
10 µL of sample, a biotinylated recombinant T. gondii-specific antigen, and a T.
gondii-specific recombinant antigen labeled with a ruthenium complex to form a
sandwich complex. After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the
complex becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and
streptavidin. The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the
microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode.
Unbound substances are then removed with ProCell. Application of a voltage to
the electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a
photomultiplier. Results are determined via a calibration curve which is
instrument generated by a 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via the
2

reagent barcode. A human serum-based calibrator is provided with the test kit,
and the recommended control material is PreciControl Toxo IgG.
The Elecsys PreciControl Toxo IgG contains two levels of human serum with
Toxo IgG antibodies.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Not applicable
L. Test Principle:
Electrochemiluminescence immunoassay
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility: Assay reproducibility studies were conducted
using the Elecsys 2010/cobas e 411 analyzers and the Modular Analytics E-
170/cobas e 601 analyzers. These studies were conducted at one US site, and
2 international sites. A panel of 3 samples and 2 controls and 21 replicates,
were tested with one reagent lot on one Elecsys 2010 analyzer and also on one
Modular Analytics E170 analyzer. For the within-run reproducibility, the
tested samples consisted of one negative (-) and one positive (+) control and 1
positive human serum. These samples were tested six times per day as single
determination (for the Elecsys 2010) and as six-fold determination (for the
Modular Analytics E170 analyzer) – also called Total precision—with one
reagent lot for a period of ten days. The study was conducted at three
different geographical sites. Intra-assay and inter-assay data for Toxo IgG
were within specification for all samples at all sites. The overall CV for the
positive specimens ranged from 2-6% for both analyzers, which is acceptable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators traceable to a World Health Organization standard
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity studies for the Elecsys Toxo IgG assay were conducted by
evaluating potential interference from 193 IgG immunoglobulins specimens
representing a variety of disease states (AMA, ANA, Chlamydia, CMV, EBV,
Gonorrhea, HAV, HBV, HCV, HIV, HSV, Influenza, Malaria, Parvovirus
B19, Rubella, Syphilis, TPAH, and VZV) as possible cross-reactants.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance Evaluation in the U.S.
A total of 515 samples were obtained from a reference laboratory in the U.S.
The initial storage conditions of the 515 samples were as follow: 512 were
fresh serum, 2 were frozen serum, and one was frozen plasma. These samples
represented subjects for whom anti-Toxoplasma testing had been ordered
from a variety of institutions throughout the US. Specific geographic
information about each sample was not collected. All samples were tested
with the VIDAS Toxo IgG Assay, Sabin Feldman Dye Test, ELISA or AC/HS
serological tests. After the completion of initial testing, all samples were
stored frozen until any repeat and confirmatory testing required per the study
protocol was completed:

Performance Evaluation in E.U.
Additional comparison studies and method comparison studies were done in
E.U. All the samples used in the European studies were from patients referred
to the lab for Toxoplasma testing. The European samples used for this studies
ranged from a combination of retrospective and characterized studies (never-
infected, previously infected, acute infected, remote infected and
sero-conversions) in addition to routine fresh samples randomly collected.
Retrospective samples consisted of frozen samples, whereas prospective

CDC Panel Study: A panel of 100 samples was obtained through the US Centers
of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and was tested for Toxo IgG on the
Elecsys 2010 analyzer. As evaluated by the CDC, the Elecsys 2010 analyzer
showed 100% agreement, with 70/70 positive tests on 70 positive sera and 30/30
negative tests on 30 negative sera.
The results are presented to provide further information on the performance of
this assay with a masked, characterized serum panel. This does not imply an
endorsement of the assay by the CDC.
