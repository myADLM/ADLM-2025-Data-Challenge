K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Not applicable
L. Test Principle:
The Rapidlab 1200 System uses multiple wavelength spectrophotometry (CO oximetry) to
measure the transmission of light through a sample of neonate whole blood to determine
concentrations of hemoglobin derivatives and bilirubin.
The Rapidlab 1200 System aspirates the whole blood sample at the sample port and then
transfers the sample to the CO-ox module. As the sample flows through an optical chamber,
the CO-ox module optics head directs light through the sample and to a polychromator that
measures the intensity of transmitted light at different wavelengths.
Iterative least squares analysis is used to determine raw bilirubin values. Raw values are then
corrected for hematocrit to produce nBili results.

Quality control materials, including manual (QC) and automatic (AutomaticQC),
were analyzed on the Rapidlab 1245 system and the Rapidlab 1265 system. Manual
QC is performed by the operator while AutomaticQC is performed automatically by
the system based on the QC frequency defined in the system software.
Precision of manual aqueous quality control materials was estimated using a
minimum of 4 Rapidlab 1245 systems and a minimum of 4 Rapidlab 1265 systems.
Controls were measured over a minimum of 10 days. AutomaticQC is automatically
scheduled to run (single sample) independently 3 times per day The within run and
total %CVs were calculated and results are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range is 2.0 to 30 mg/dl. A linearity study was performed be using a
naturally occurring low sample with a measured bilirubin concentration of 0.2 mg/dL
and a spiked high sample with a measured concentration of 77.1 mg/dL. Nine
intermediate samples were made by combining proportions of the low and high
samples volumetrically. The high, low, and intermediate samples were run in
replicates of four in one day. The data was analysed in accordance with CLSI EP-6.
There was no evidence of extreme nonlinearity or outliers with any of the results.
First, second, and third order regressions were performed and indicated statistically
non-linear regression coefficients. The cubic model was found to be the best
mathematical fit and the differenced between the linear and cubic predicted values
were assessed. The differences between the fits were found to be within the
sponsor’s acceptance criteria indicating a clinically insignificant difference between
the linear and cubic predicted values. These results demonstrate the linearity of the
device across the claimed measuring range.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no separate calibrator value assignment for nBili. The critical parameter that
requires calibration for nBili is the path length which is accomplished with the total
6

hemoglobin, tHb, value assignment. The tHb calibrator was cleared under k031560.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection was determined in accordance with CLSI EP-17A. Eight
unique whole blood specimens were exposed to a photolysing light source overnight
to create the blank samples. These samples were each assessed in replicates of ten on
two instruments over a minimum of five operating days. The limit of blank (LOB)
was calculated from these results using the 95th percentile of the ascending rank
ordered values for each instrument. The mean LOB calculated from the two
instruments was 0.1 mg/dL.
In order to calculate the limit of detection (LOD), eight unique whole blood samples,
with bilirubin concentrations in the range of 0.5 to 2.0 mg/dL were each assessed in
replicates of ten on two instruments over a minimum of five operating days. The
LOD was calculated as LOD = LOB + Cβ(Std Dev) and resulted in a mean LOD
from the two instruments of 0.7 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed by spiking fresh whole blood samples to
approximately 20 mg/dL bilirubin, then spiking these samples with interferents at the
concentrations shown below. Control samples were made by spiking the same whole
blood samples with the same volume of diluent as the interferent. All samples were
tested and the interference spiked test samples were compared to the diluent spiked
control samples. A two-tail t-test was conducted to assess the observed differences
between the interference and control samples. With the exception of lipids, all
substances tested showed a discernable statistical difference between the test and
control samples. The table below was included in the labeling to show the
interference testing results. Hemoglobin interference was deemed unnecessary due to
the design of the instrument.

CyanMethemoglobin 10% 92.6%

N. Instrument Name:
Rapidlab 1245 and Rapidlab 1265
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Neonatal Bilirubin (nBili) is a new parameter enabled on models 1245 and 1265 of the
Rapidlab® 1200 blood gas family of instruments. It is available with Rapidlab Software
Version 2.1. Models 1245 and 1265 currently measure a number of parameters that have
been previously cleared under K031560. With the planned release of software version
2.1 the ability to measure nBili parameter will be added.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ________
9

--- Page 10 ---
3. Specimen Identification:
Samples are identified by barcode.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Users follow the same sample handling process already in place for other measuring
parameters on RL1200 blood gas instrument. Users can analyze samples using the
sample collection devices and whole blood is collected in a heparanized syringe or
capillary.
5. Calibration:
The same calibration procedures are required as in k031560. The tHb calibration curve is
used in nBili measurements. The targeted calibration points for tHb are:
• Calibration Point: 0 g/dL
• Slope Point: 15 g/dL
6. Quality Control:
The same Quality Control (QC) procedures are recommended as in k031560. The nBili
QC is dependent on tHb QC. As a result, if tHb or any of the four CO-ox fractions
(FO2Hb, FCOHb, FMetHb, and FHHb) fail or miss QC, nBili is also marked QC Failed
or QC Missed. On the other hand, if nBili fails or misses QC, tHb and the other CO-ox
fractions will not be affected. The optional AutomaticQC module allows the system to
automatically analyze QC materials at pre-programmed intervals. The manual QC mode
allows the users to manually run QC as desired.
