L. Test Principle:
Proteins contained in human body fluids react with specific antibodies in the reagent, to form
immune complexes in an immunochemical reaction. These complexes in the reaction mixture
cause the scatter of a beam of light passed through the samples. The intensity of the scattered
light is proportional to the concentration of IgG in the sample. The result is evaluated by
comparison with a standard of known concentration.

Reproducibility testing was done in accordance with CLSI document EP5-A. The
intra-assay reproducibility was determined by testing four samples in duplicate twice
a day for 20 days. The samples included one serum pool (12.99 g/L), two human
source CSF pools (19.28 mg/L and 110.58 mg/L), and one Protein 3 Control (20.25
mg/L). The serum pool had %CV of 2.7%; CSF pools 3.1% and 3.9%; Prot 3 control
1.2%,
The inter-assay reproducibility was determined by testing the same four samples in
duplicate twice a day for 20 days. The serum pool had %CV of 3.4%; the CSF pools
3.9% and 3.2%; Prot 3 Control 3.9%. The data are summarized below:
Material Mean Intra-assay Inter-assay
SD %CV SD %CV
Serum pool 1299 mg/dL 1.870 2.7 1.870 3.4
CSF pool 1 19.28 mg/L 3.152 3.1 3.152 3.9
CSF pool 2 110.58 mg/L 14.744 2.3 14.744 3.2
PROT 3 CON 20.25 mg/L 3.304 1.2 3.304 3.9
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by testing a human CSF with high
concentration (129 mg/L) of IgG. This sample was serially diluted 12 times with
System Diluent down to the lower measuring range (4.39 mg/L). Each dilution was
tested in replicates of five. Percent recovery was calculated using the formula: (Mean
of test/expected concentration) x 100. All dilutions met the acceptance criteria of 80
to 120%.
The linear regression analysis was performed. The acceptance criteria of slope
between 0.9 and 1.1 and correlation of coefficient ≥0.95 were met. Data showed a
regression equation y = 1.0041+0.3351, r2 of 0.9995.
Reportable range for IgG-C device was set at 4.4 - 123 mg/L
Antigen Excess Effect:
The possibility of antigen excess occurring when using the device was evaluated with
serum and CSF samples above the assay range. The sample was analyzed on both the
BN ProSpec® System and the Dimension Vista™ instrument, indicating no antigen
excess effect up to 1960 mg/L for CSF IgG and 78.3 g/L for serum IgG.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrator is traceable to the reference material ERM® DA 470 (CRM 470).
Stability
The expiration date claims for the reagents are as follows:
Unopened reagent cartridges and closed vials:
Dimension Vista™ IgG Flex® reagent cartridge (IGG) – 24 months
Dimension Vista™ Protein 1 Calibrator – 24 months
Dimension Vista™ Protein 3 Control – 24 months

d. Detection limit:
Detection limit (4.4 mg/L) represents the lower limit of the reportable range of CSF
IgG. The analytical sensitivity is defined as the minimal detectable level of analyte,
which can be distinguished from zero. The value was calculated as the mean value of
fifteen replicates of three CSF samples and system diluent. It was determined to be
3.87 mg/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed according to CLSI document EP7A2. No
significant interference was observed in the presence of the following interferents:
Bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated) up to 60 mg/dL, Hemoglobin up to 750
mg/dL.
Non-interfering substances section of the device package insert provides a list of 39
drugs and other exogenous substances that do not interfere with the assay at the
concentrations indicated for serum/ plasma and CSF sample matrices.
The package insert states the following: ‘Lipemic samples should be avoided’ and
‘Inaccuracies (biases) due to the listed 39 substances are less than 10% at IgG
concentrations of 842 - 2651 mg/dL in serum and plasma; and 2.67 – 5.48 mg/dL in
CSF.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The reported expected range for the Immunoglobulin G (IgG) in adults (7.0 – 16.0 g/L) is
from literature (Dati F, Schumann G, Thomas L, et al. Consensus of a group of
professional societies and diagnostic companies on guidelines for interim reference
ranges for 14 proteins in serum based on the standardization against the IFCC/BCR/CAP
Reference Material (CRM 470). Eur J Clin Chem Clin Biochem 34: 517-20, 1996).
During childhood and adolescence, reference ranges for IgG are age dependent. (Refer to
Ritchie RF et al in J Clin Lab Anal 1998;12:363-70).
The CSF IgG reference range (≤ 34.0 mg/L or 3.40 mg/dL) is from literature (Reiber H et
al in Lab Med 1988;12:101-109).
[Note in P.I.: CSF IgG reference intervals in the strict sense exist only for CSF/serum
ratios]
Each laboratory should establish its own expected values for IgG as performed on the
Dimension Vista® System
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
