4. Panel:
83 Microbiology
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Daptomycin at a concentration of 0.0313 – 16 μg/mL on the Streptococcus
ID/AST or AST only Phoenix panels is intended for use with the BD Phoenix
Automated Microbiology System for in vitro quantitative determination of
antimicrobial susceptibility by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of most
Gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria isolates from pure
culture for Enterobacteriaceae and non – Enterobacteriaceae and most Gram-
positive bacteria isolates from pure culture belonging to the genera
Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus.
2. Indication(s) for use:
This premarket notification is indicated for the addition of the antimicrobial agent
Daptomycin at concentrations of 0.0313 – 16μg/mL to Streptococcus ID/AST or
AST only Phoenix panels for testing Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus
dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, and Streptococcus pyogenes.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation
and software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136
micro-wells containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations
for ID and AST indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and
be preliminarily identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then
suspended in broth, and equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to
use the BD CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST
broth, which contains an AST indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST
broth is a cation-adjusted formulation of Mueller-Hinton broth containing 0.01%
Tween 80, a wetting agent. After adding the indicator solution to the AST
inoculum the color turns to blue. After inoculation and incubation, the color
changes to pink then to colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds.

Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix™
Automated Microbiology System instrument where the panels are incubated at
35°C. The AST has a final inoculum of 5 x 105 CFU/ml. The instrument
incubates, reads and records the results of the biochemical substrates and
antimicrobial agents and interprets the reactions to give an ID of the isolate and
MIC value and category interpretation of the antimicrobial agents. Organisms
growing in the presence of a given antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator,
signaling organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobic agent. Organisms
killed or inhibited by a given antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the indicator
and therefore do not produce a color change. Additional interpretation is done
using software driven “EXPERT” System using rules derived from the CLSI
documentation.
Readings are taken every 20 minutes however, the AST result is only available
between 4-16 hours. This is only an autoread result; no manual readings are
possible with this system.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S18) “Methods for
Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard.”
L. Test Principle:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth based microdilution
method that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance
detection of organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells
containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control
wells” which contains no antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Thirty-three isolates were evaluated for site to site and inte-site reproducibility
demonstrating >95% reproducibility. The ten isolate study described in the
guidance document was used (10 organisms tested 3 times on 3 days at 3
sites).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The FDA and CLSI recommended Quality Control (QC) isolate, S.
pneumoniae ATCC 49619 was tested on every test occasion with the
reference method and the BD Phoenix™. The mode of the BD Phoenix™
was one well dilution higher than the reference method. The reference
method QC results were in range for every day tested. The BD Phoenix™
was tested a sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the system can
produce QC results in the recommended ranges.

The broth dilution reference panel was prepared according to FDA and CLSI
recommendation and was used to compare with the BD Phoenix™ results.
The broth reference panel for Streptococcus spp. other than S. pneumoniae
was set up on Mueller Hinton broth adjusted to a calcium content of 50
mg/mL, supplemented with 2% to 5% lysed horse blood, inoculated with a
direct colony suspension and incubated in ambient air at 35°C for 20 – 24
hours as recommended by FDA and CLSI. Clinical testing was performed at
several sites. The testing included both fresh clinical isolates and stock
isolates along with a challenge set with known results. The test device had a
growth rate of >90%. A comparison was provided to the reference method
with the following agreement.

EA-Essential Agreement CA-Category Agreement
NS-Not susceptible; there is only a susceptible category
Essential agreement (EA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panels agree with the
reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference
method. Category agreement (CA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panel result
interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation.
Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the BD Phoenix™ and
the reference and have on-scale EA.
There appears to be a slight trend where the test device is more susceptible than the
reference method as reflected in the Accuracy study. There is one not susceptible
isolate due to S. pyogenes.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. dysagalactiae subsp. equisimilis ≤1 (S)
The MIC interpretive criteria for Streptococcus spp. other than S. pneumoniae are
applicable only to tests performed by broth dilution using Mueller Hinton broth
adjusted to a calcium content of 50 mg/mL, supplemented with 2% to 5% lysed
horse blood, inoculated with a direct colony suspension and incubated in ambient
air at 35°C for 20 – 24 hours as recommended by CLSI.
The current absence of data on Daptomycin resistant isolates precludes defining
any categories other than “Susceptible.” Isolates yielding test results suggestive
of a “Non-susceptible” category should be retested, and if the result is confirmed,
the isolate should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
