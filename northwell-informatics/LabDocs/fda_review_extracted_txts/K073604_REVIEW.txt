L. Test Principle:
The FT4L method is a homogenous, sequential, chemiluminescent immunoassay based on
LOCI® technology. The LOCI® reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and a
biotinylated anti-T4 mouse monoclonal antibody. The first bead reagent (Chemibeads) is
coated with triiodothyronine (T3), a naturally occurring, weaker binding analog of T4, and
contains chemiluminescent dye. The second bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with
streptavidin and contains a photosensitizer dye. In a first step, sample is incubated with
biotinylated antibody which allows T4 from the sample to saturate a fraction of the
biotinylated antibody that is directly related to the free T4 concentration. In a second step, T3
chemibeads are added and form bead/biotinylated antibody immunocomplexes with the non-
saturated fraction of the biotinylated antibody. Sensibeads are then added and bind to the
biotin to form bead pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at 680 nm generates
singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a
chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at 612 nm and is an inverse
function of the FT4 concentration in the sample.

--- Page 7 ---
The precision study was conducted using Bio-Rad Lyphochek® commercial controls
and serum pools. Serum pool 1 was prepared from normal human serum. Serum pool
2 was prepared from normal human serum spiked with USP grade Thyroxine. The
Bio-Rad levels were 0.71, 2.20 and 5.67 ng/mL. The serum pools were 1.17 and 6.36
ng/dL. These concentrations span the measuring range which is 0.1 - 8.0 ng/dL.
There were two runs per day for twenty days. Measurements were taken by two
operators. The data was collected on one reagent lot on one instrument. The data was
analyzed using analysis of variance. The data is summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The measuring range was determined using the Level 5 LOCI® Thyroid Calibrator
and the calibrator base matrix. Intermediate levels were prepared by proportional
mixing of these calibrators to produce concentrations evenly distributed across the
measuring range. There were eleven concentrations (0.15-8.62 ng/dL) evenly
distributed across the measuring range. Each sample was assayed in replicates of n=5.
The data was analyzed using least squares linear regression. The quadratic term of a
second order polynomial fit was statistically insignificant (p value = 0.2911),
supporting linearity across the measuring range. The results from least squares linear
regression analysis were: slope = 1.03, y-intercept = -0.21 and R2 = 1.00.

Based on this study and on the Limit of Detection (see section d below), the
reportable range was determined to be 0.1-8.0 ng/dL. Samples with results higher
than 8.0 ng/dL will be reported as greater than 8.0 and the results are flagged by the
Dimension® EXL™ with LM system. Samples above the measuring range should
not be diluted. This is stated in the instructions for use, in the section "Analytical
Measurement Range" of the labeling. The Dimension® FT4L method is not a
sandwich immunoassay. Hook effect is not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrator Traceability:
USP-grade thyroxine is spiked into stripped human serum at different concentrations.
This becomes the “Anchor Pool”. The “Anchor Pool” values are validated in-house.
A Master Pool is developed from stripped bovine albumin to which different
concentrations of thyroxine have been added. Values for the Master Pool are derived
by multiple analyses against the Anchor Pool calibration curve. LOCI® Thyroid
Calibrator value assignment is established by measurement against the Master Pool
calibration.
Stability:
The shelf life and opened bottle stability of the LOCI® Thyroid Calibrator is on-
going using real-time data collected from three (3) lots of the calibrator. All testing is
being performed using product which is in its final container. The target shelf life is
12 months. The target open bottle stability is 3 months.
Closed vial stability protocol:
Identical lots of calibrators are used. One set is stored at 4°C (test) throughout the
study and the other at -70°C (control). Both sets of calibrators will be tested at Day 0
and monthly thereafter for 12 months plus a minimum of 6 days. Replicates of each
level will be analyzed for acceptable recovery and drift over time. The test lot will be
evaluated for recovery against the calibration curve derived from the control lot.
Open vial stability protocol:
Identical lots of calibrators are used. Both sets are stored at 4°C. The control set will
be unopened throughout the study and the other stored opened (test). The test
calibrator is returned to 2-8°C storage to simulate worst-case usage of opened
calibrators. At each time point, the Dimension® FT4L method is calibrated using the
control calibrators to generate a standard curve. The test calibrators are recovered
from the standard curve. Recovery of the test calibrators versus time is plotted and
drift is determined by the slope of the regression line.

d. Detection limit:
A Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Blank (LoB) study was conducted using
four blank samples and four low analyte samples. The four blank samples were water,
phosphate buffered saline, HEPES buffered saline and stripped serum. The low
analyte samples were prepared from four individual patient samples that were diluted
with stripped serum to levels that were approximately 4 times the limit of the blank.
Each blank and low analyte sample was assayed in triplicate using two reagent lots on
two instruments over three days. The Limit of Blank was determined from the non-
parametric distribution of one-hundred-and-forty-four (144) measurements of the
blank samples. The Limit of Detection was calculated from the following equation:
LoD = LoB + ( C x SD ).
p s
The LoB was determined from non-parametric distribution of 144 blank
measurements (95 % interval). The LoD for FT4L is 0.06 ng/dL (0.77 pmol/L) with
proportions of false positives (α) and false negatives (β) less than 5%, and a LoB of
0.03 ng/dL (0.39 pmol/L).
= 0.03 ng/dL
LoD = LoB + (Cp x SDs)
= 0.03 ng/dL + ( 1.648 * 0.0169 ng/dL)
= 0.03 ng/dL + 0.03 ng/dL
= 0.06 ng/dL.
The Limit of Detection was calculated from the following equation: LoD =
LoB + ( C x SD ).

e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical Specificity
Analytical specificity was evaluated for the Dimension® FT4L method on the
Dimension® EXL™ with LM system. One hundred normal patient samples were
assayed in duplicate for albumin, thyroid binding globulin (TBG) and free thyroxine
(FT4). The data was analyzed using least squares linear regression. No significant
correlation was observed between albumin and FT4 (r=0.042) or between TBG and
FT4 (r=0.145). Samples from normal patients were used in the study. The range of
values as determined by the Dimension® EXL™ with LM system were:
Free thyroxine values: 0.61 - 1.61 ng/dL.
Albumin values: 3.1 - 8.0 g/dL.
TBG values: 8 - 35 mg/L

Cross reactivity was evaluated against monoiodotyrosine (1 mg/dL), diiodotyrosine (1
mg/dL), d-thyroxine (10 µg/dL), L-Triiodothyronine (600 ng/dL), R-Triiodothyronine
(100 ng/dL) and 3,5-Diiodo-L-Thyronine (600 ng/dL). The calibrator base material
was used as a control. Test samples were prepared with the cross reactant substance
spiked into calibrator base matrix. Samples were assayed in replicates of n=5. Cross
reactivity was calculated as the difference between the mean of the test and control
sample. The Dimension® FT4L Flex® had cross-reactivity which was equivalent to
the predicate device.

normal human serum spiked with 3 ng/dL USP grade Thyroxine. Samples were
assayed in replicates of n=5 and the means calculated.
The control pool consisted of normal human serum with the appropriate amount of
buffer added.
The % bias was calculated using the following equation.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
180 patient samples were obtained retrospectively from either blood banks or from
local hospitals. Samples were frozen at the collection site and tested at the
manufacturer’s site. The samples were assayed on both the new device and the
predicate device on the same day. The range of values for the Dimension® FT4L
Flex® on the Dimension® EXL™ with LM was 0.16 - 7.30 ng/dL. The range of
values for the Dimension® FT4 Flex® on the Dimension Vista™ was 0.16 - 7.45
ng/dL. The data was analyzed using least squares linear regression. The summary
regression statistics and 95% confidence interval are provided below.

N. Instrument Name:
Dimension® EXL™ with LOCI Module (LM) Clinical Chemistry System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Dimension® EXL™ with LOCI Module (LM) Clinical Chemistry System is a
discrete, random access multi-functional analytical device that processes chemical and
immunoassay methodologies utilizing photometric, turbidimetric, chemiluminescence,
and integrated ion selective multisensor detection technologies.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes __X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Barcode labeled tubes, racks, or sample cups
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Uncapped direct patient tube sampling is provided via sample racks containing slots for
up to ten samples. Barcoded sample cups may also be used. Non-barcoded samples can
be manually programmed with unique identifiers and rack position. The racks are loaded
onto a sample wheel where a sampling arm picks up a portion of the specimen and
delivers it to the appropriate testing vessel or area. The instrument can be programmed
to evaluate degree of hemolysis, icteric, and lipemia. It can also be programmed to
perform automatic dilutions, reflex testing and repeats.
5. Calibration:
Automatic and on-demand calibrations can be performed. Calibration calculations are
automatically performed using either linear regression or log-logit. Calibration curves
and calibration history are stored in the software and can be reviewed for acceptance by
the operator.
