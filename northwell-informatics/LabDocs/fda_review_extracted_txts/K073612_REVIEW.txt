b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study was performed using CLSI EP6-A as a guideline. The
samples were diluted in 11 steps (from 0% to 100%) by mixing samples with
each other 1:1. Two parallel measurements were made in random order using
one reagent lot. The extended linearity range was a separate set of samples
prepared and measured as above. Six samples were run using an additional
secondary dilution of 1:15. Results were as follows:
Linearity Study Extended Range
Sample Range 0.07-27.0 mg/dL 6.5-162.9 mg/dL
N 11 11
Slope 0.95 0.96
Intercept 0.007 -0.055
Observer Error 4.9% 4.5%
Based on the linearity study data, the sponsor will claim a measuring range of
0.2-20.0 mg/dL and an extended measuring range of 0.2-40.0 mg/dL after
secondary dilution.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability for sCal
Traceability is to NIST SRM 909b using a two-fold process. First, the value
of the NIST SRM 909b is transferred to a lot of sCal by calibrating the T60
with the NIST material and running the sCal and 5 commercially available
controls in triplicate. The measurements are repeated three times on multiple
analyzers. Second, the sCal with the newly assigned value is used to calibrate
multiple analyzers. The sCal is also run as a sample with 5 commercially
available controls in replicates of 10 each.
Traceability of Nortrol and Abtrol
The traceability of controls is determined by calibrating the Uric Acid assay
using sCal. The controls together with NIST SRM 909b and five
commercially available controls are run as samples with three replicates. The
measurements are repeated ten times using several different instruments and
ten individual control vials from each control. The control ranges are
calculated as median ± 8 %. The expected values for each lot are provided on
the value sheet provided with the product.

Intercept	0.007	-0.055
Observer Error	4.9%	4.5%

Stability
The protocols and acceptance criteria for stability studies were reviewed and
found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims an open on-board stability of
reagents for 32 days. After reconstitution sCal, Abtrol, and Nortrol are stable
for 7 days at 2-8 °C.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) studies were performed
according to CLSI EP17-A. In the LoB study, thirty replicates of a blank
sample (0.9% NaCl) were run using two T60 instruments and two reagent lots
for a total of 60 measurements. The LoB was determined to be 0.01 mg/dL.
The LoD study consisted of five low level samples run in ten replicates with
two T60 instruments and two reagent lots during two days for a total of 100
measurements. The LoD was determined to be 0.06 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous and exogenous interference: The interference study was
performed according to CLSI EP7-A. Three concentrations of uric acid were
run in paired-difference testing with five different levels of interferent against
control pools containing no interferent. Three parallel measurements were
taken for each level. This protocol was performed for icterus and lipemia.
Interference from hemolysis was determined using the same protocol except
that control and test pools were tested in four replicates within one run.
Interference from ascorbic acid was determined using the same protocol as the
hemolysate. The sponsor defined interference as a difference greater than ±
10% or ± 0.8 mg/dL of the initial value.
According to the interference studies, the following claims were established:
Lipemia: No interference found up to 900 mg/dL (9g/L) of Intralipid.
Hemolysate: No interference found up to 1000 mg/dL (10 g/L) of
hemoglobin.
Bilirubin conjugated: No interference found up to 11 mg/dL (200 micmol/L)
of conjugated bilirubin.
Bilirubin unconjugated: No interference found up to 14 mg/dL (250
micmol/L) of unconjugated bilirubin.
Ascorbic Acid: No interference of ascorbic acid up to 50 mg/L (5 mg/dL).

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed using CLSI EP9-A as a guide.
One hundred thirty-six Li-heparin plasma samples (122 native, 14 contrived)
were analyzed using T60i with Uric Acid reagents and Bayer Advia 2400
instrument with Uric Acid reagents to demonstrate the equivalence of the two
systems. Samples ranged from 0.27 mg/dL to 18.94 mg/dL. The samples
were split in two and run either on the predicate (one replicate) or candidate
device (as duplicates). Deming regression analysis resulted in the equation:
y = 1.07x-0.13, R = 0.999
b. Matrix comparison:
Eighty-eight matched serum and plasma (Li-heparin) samples (77 native, 3
diluted and 12 spiked) were run on the T60. Dilutions and spiking were
performed in parallel on the matched samples. Samples ranged from 0.8
mg/dL to 19.0 mg/dL. Deming regression analysis resulted in the equation:
y = 1.01x-0.01, R = 1.000.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
