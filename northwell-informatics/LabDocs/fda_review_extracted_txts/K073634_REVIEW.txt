K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI EP5-A, CLSI EP-6A, CLSI EP17A, and CLSI EP9-A2
L. Test Principle:
Creatininase (in reagent 1) hydrolyzes creatinine in a sample to creatine. Creatine is
hydrolyzed by creatinase to sarcosine and urea. Sarcosine from this reaction is
oxidized by sarcosine oxidase to glycine and formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide.
The hydrogen peroxide reacts with 4-aminoantipyrine and ESPMT in the presence of
peroxidase to yield a quinoneimine dye. The resulting change in absorbance at 548
nm is proportional to the creatinine concentration in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i.) Precision studies for serum samples were evaluated using CLSI EP5-A as a
guideline. For within-run (intra-assay) and total precision studies, testing was
performed on both Architect c8000 and Aeroset systems. For within-run
precision, 3 serum controls were run in singlet for one day. For total
precision, 3 serum controls were tested twice daily, in duplicate, for over 20
days. Results of the precision studies were shown below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity study was assessed according to CLSI EP-6A.
i.) Serum samples: Serum linearity was assessed on three different ranges of
human sera: whole analytical measuring range (2.3 to 53 mg/dL), pathologic
analytical measuring range (pre dialysis range of 0.39 to 9.7 mg/dL) and low
analytical measuring range (0.04 to 2.2 mg/dL). The spiked pools were
serially diluted to obtain a set of at least 10 samples with proportionally
decreased concentrations of creatinine. Serum sample pools were assayed in
triplicates. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion was a bias of 5% between the
expected values and the observed values. The study supported the sponsor’s
linearity claim range of 0.1 to 40.0 mg/dL.

ii.) Urine samples: Urine linearity was assessed on a pool of human urine that
was spiked with a concentrated solution to obtain a final analyte concentration
exceeding the targeted high linearity and was serially diluted to obtain a set of
at least 12 samples with proportionally decreased concentrations of creatinine.
The study covered the entire analytical measuring range (22.9 to 476.6
mg/dL) and the low analytical measuring range (2.39 to 52.45 mg/dL).Urine
sample pools were run in triplicates and the sponsor’s acceptance criterion
was a bias of 5% between the expected values and the observed values. The
study supported the sponsor’s linearity claim range of 2.5 to 400 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The assay is traceable to IDMS values through SRM967.
This device does not include the calibrator materials. The sponsor’s labeling
recommends using the MULTIGENT Clin Chem Calibrators (cleared in
k070971). The sponsor states that the recommended calibrators are stable for
60 days when stored on-board and is required for each new lot of reagent.
The sponsor conducted open on-board, closed stability (reagent) and
calibration stability of reagents 1 and 2 on both the ARCHITECT c8000 and
AEROSET systems. On-board stability of the assay reagents was conducted
with new calibrators, two control materials and a prepared human serum
sample and calibrator were analyzed over 98 days- every 3 to 4 days. Shelf-
life stability was determined using an accelerated stability study. The
sponsor’s on-board/open stability for the MULTIGENT Creatinine
(Enzymatic) Assay reagents is stable up to 60 days at 2-10° C and has a shelf
life stability of 120 days when stored at 2-8° C.
d. Detection limit:
i.) A detection limits study was performed according to the CLSI EP17A
guideline for the serum samples. The serum LOB was determined by
assaying saline and human control serum in replicates of 20 for 3 different
runs on the Aeroset and Architect instruments. The serum LOD was
determined by assaying a human control serum mixed with a pool of human
sera (for a concentration 4 to 6 times higher than the found LOB) assayed in
20 replicates for 3 different runs on the Aeroset and Architect instruments.
The serum LOQ was determined with a pool of human sera with
concentrations around the clinical decision level (1.00 mg/dL). The sera pool
was serially diluted with a commercially available analyte free human serum
material. Each sample was tested on the Aeroset and the Architect in
replicates of 10. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion was a total error no
greater than 15% (defined by the sponsor as %bias + 2X %CV). The detection
limits study supported the sponsor's measuring range claims of 0.1-40.0

was diluted with saline (for a creatine concentration around 5 to 6 times

Aeroset and Architect instruments. The urine LOQ was determined with two
human urine samples with a concentration about 40 mg/dL. The samples
were serially diluted with saline to obtain two set of samples with decreased
concentrations of creatinine and run in replicated of 10 on the Aeroset and
Architect instruments. The detection limits study supported the sponsor’s

interferences caused by ascorbic acid, glucose, hemoglobin, conjugated
bilirubin, protein (albumin) and pH in urine samples. The following
substances demonstrated no significant bias as defined by the sponsor as +/-

b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was conducted to assess the acceptability of 5
different blood collection tube types. Li-heparin plasma (without gel), Li-
heparin plasma (with gel barrier), Na-heparin plasma, Serum (with gel
barrier), and EDTA plasma were tested against a serum tube (without gel).
The creatinine samples (22 native and 49 spiked) ranged from 0.49 to 36.23
mg/dl from 71 subjects were used for the study. The sponsors acceptance
criterion is a slope between 0.95 to 1.05 and a correlation coefficient greater
than 0.970. The following table supports the usage of lithium heparin (with or
without gel barrier), sodium heparin and SST for sample collection for the
Multigent Creatinine (enzymatic) assay. However, EDTA returned a bias of -
9.1% and is not a recommended anticoagulant. This is noted in the package
insert.
