The ARCHITECT Homocysteine Calibrators are for the calibration of the
ARCHITECT i System when used for the quantitative determination of total l-
homocysteine in human serum or plasma.
Controls:
The ARCHITECT Homocysteine Controls are for the estimation of test precision
and the detection of systematic analytical deviations of the ARCHITECT i
System (reagents, calibrators and instrument), when used for the quantitative
determination of total l-homocysteine in human serum or plasma.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use
The labeling contains a prominent black-box warning:
Patients who are on drug therapy involving S-adenosyl-L-methionine may show
falsely elevated levels of homocysteine. Specimens from patients taking
methotrexate, carbamazepine, phenytoin, nitrous oxide, anticonvulsants and 6-
azuridine triacetate may have elevated levels of homocysteine due to their effect
on the metabolic pathway.
4. Special instrument requirements:

L. Test Principle:
The ARCHITECT Homocysteine assay is a one-step immunoassay for the
quantitative determination of total L-homocysteine in human serum or plasma using
CMIA (Chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay) technology. Bound or
dimerised homocysteine (oxidized form) is reduced by dithiothreitol (DTT) to free
homocysteine, which is then converted to S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) by the
action of the recombinant enzyme S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase (rSAHHase)
in the presence of excess adenosine. The SAH then competes with acridinium-labeled
S-adenosyl cysteine for particle-bound monoclonal antibody. Following a wash stage
and magnetic separation, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction
mixture and the resulting chemiluminescence is measured as relative light units

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators and controls were previously cleared under k980812 and k992858.
Traceability and Value Assignment:
Calibrators are prepared from in-house S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine by
gravimetric addition of the compound to phosphate buffer. Calibrators are
tested and compared to frozen internal reference calibrators. Kit calibrators A-
F are assigned values 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 50 µmol/L, respectively.
Controls are prepared by gravimetric addition of L-homocystine to buffered
serum then are adjusted to within a specified concentration range around
target means for controls low, medium and high respectively.
Shelf-life and in-use stability is supported by real time and accelerated
stability studies. The protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and
determined to be adequate.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor states that determination of Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of
Detection (LoD) followed guidance from CLSI document EP17-A.
A sample panel was prepared by diluting an EDTA plasma sample spiked
with ~5.4 µmol/L homocysteine with ARCHITECT on-board wash buffer, to
create a series of samples with very low concentrations of homocysteine.
ARCHITECT Homocysteine Calibrators A to F (ranging in value from 0-50
µmol/L), Controls Low, Medium and High and the plasma sample panel were
tested in a series of experiments over 20 days, using two ARCHITECT
instruments and two lots of reagents. The data from a total of n=40
measurements for Calibrators B-F, controls, and plasma samples and n=120
measurement of Calibrator A were analyzed.

The limit of blank (LOB) was calculated using the following equation and was
determined to be 0.30 µmol/L.
LOB = Mean Cal A result + 1.645 x SD
The mean and Standard Deviation (SD) was calculated for the pooled data
from each sample in the plasma panel. Then the following equation was
applied:
LOD = LOB + 1.645 x pooled SD
The Limit of Detection was determined to be 0.64 µmol/L and is below the
claimed limit of detection of ≤ 1.00 µmol/L.
The analyzer reports sample results ≥1 µmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were designed using CLSI EP7-A. Five (5) EDTA plasma
samples with homocysteine concentrations ranging from 3.5 to 40.5 µmol/L
were spiked with the bilirubin, hemoglobin, lipid or protein (bovine gamma
globulin) and compared to the same sample without the added compound. No
significant interference was defined as the observed value within ± 10% of the
control value. The results obtained indicated that there was no significant
interference by the following interferents:
(cid:131) Hemoglobin up to 1000 mg/dL
(cid:131) Bilirubin up to 20 mg/dL
(cid:131) Triglycerides up to 6000 mg/dL
(cid:131) Protein up to 12 g/dL
(cid:131) Heparin up to 1 U/mL
The cross-reactivity of six structurally related compounds was evaluated using
the ARCHITECT Homocysteine assay. Plasma samples with normal levels of
homocysteine were spiked with each compound and these were compared to
control sample spiked with an equivalent volume of saline. The results are
summarized in the table below.

Under the “Limitations of the procedure” section of the package insert, the
following statements have been provided for end-users:
"S-adenosyl-L-methionine is an antidepressant whose molecular form is
similar to S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. This drug may interfere with the
ARCHITECT Homocysteine assay."
“The following drugs may elevate levels of homocysteine: methotrexate,
carbamazepine, phenytoin, nitrous oxide, and azuridine triacetate. The
mechanism of action of these drugs affects different parts of the metabolic
pathway of homocysteine.”
The package insert also contains language to alert users that specimens from
patients containing human anti-mouse antibodies or heterophilic antibodies
may interfere with the ARCHITECT Homocysteine assay and produce
erroneous results.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor states that the method comparison study was based on guidance
from CLSI protocol EP9-A2.
A total of 456 samples from apparently healthy male and female donors were
obtained from a US sample bank. Of these samples 292 were spiked with L-
homocysteine to obtain samples across the assay range.
Samples covered the range 3.18 to 49.39 µmol/L (ARCHITECT) and 3.70 to
49.94 µmol/L (AxSYM) in order to support the measuring range for the assay
up to 50.00 µmol/L. Data from this study are summarized in the following
table.

(0.97-1.00) (-0.99 to -0.54) (0.98-0.99)
b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison studies were performed by collecting fresh whole blood
with each of the following collection tubes: Potassium EDTA plasma, Lithium
Heparin plasma, Serum and Serum Separator Tube (SST). Samples were
collected on ice. A total of forty (40) matched sample set were evaluated over
two assay runs. Twenty (20) samples were natural and 20 were spiked with L-
homocysteine to cover the range of the assay (6-48 μmol/L). The percent
recovery for each tube-type was calculated by comparing the mean value of
the EDTA tube type sample to the mean value for the corresponding Serum,
SST, and Lithium Heparin tube type sample
When comparing homocysteine results for potassium EDTA plasma samples
(control tube type) to the same samples collected in serum clot, serum
separator and lithium heparin tubes, all but one sample recovered within
±10% of the control. One lithium heparin sample with homocysteine value
approximately 13 µmol/L, recovered within 112% of the potassium EDTA
control sample.
