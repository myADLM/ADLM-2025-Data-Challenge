510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
k073677
B. Purpose for Submission:
Marketing product in the U.S.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Aperio Technologies, Inc.
ScanScope® XT System, IHC ER/PR Breast Tissue Image Analysis
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Computer-assisted image analyzer for immunohistochemistry ER/PR slides
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The ScanScope® XT System is an automated digital slide creation, management,
viewing and analysis system which consists of an automated digital microscope
slide scanner, computer, color monitor, keyboard and digital pathology
information management software and image analysis software. In this particular
application the image analysis software assists the pathologist in quantitative
assessment of immunohistochemistry stained histological specimens for estrogen
receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR). The system software makes no
independent interpretations of the data.
2. Principles of Operation:
3. Modes of Operation:
Computer-assisted interpretation.
4. Specimen Identification:
Specimens are identified by slide label (a digital image is taken of the slide label
and stored with the digital slide) or by barcode, if provided by the user’s
laboratory information system.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Immunohistochemical stained microslides can be loaded in the ScanScope XT
manually (one at a time) or automatically. The ScanScope XT can automatically
scan 120 slides contained in slide racks.
6. Calibration:
Calibration of the ScanScope XT is an automated process which is re-verified as
part of the scanning process for every scanned slide. If the calibration is not
within predefined limits, then the user is prevented from scanning the slide and
must take steps to assure that the scan is within acceptable limits.
When the user scans a slide, the controller software automatically performs a
“prescan”. The prescan is a scan of a small region of the slide which contains
clear glass or “white space”. The brightness and color characteristics of the image
are used to correct the resulting scanned image. The main functions of the
prescan process are to automatically verify that no significant tissue is present,
flatten the illumination field, correct the white balance, and measure bulb
brightness.

pathologist in the detection and quantitative measurement of ER (Estrogen
Receptor) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal and neoplastic tissue.
The IHC PR Image Analysis application is intended for use as an aid to the
pathologist in the detection and quantitative measurement of PR (Progesterone
Receptor) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal and neoplastic tissue.
It is indicated for use as an aid in the management, prognosis, and prediction of
therapy outcomes of breast cancer.
Note: The IHC ER and PR Image Analysis applications are an adjunctive
computer-assisted methodology to assist the reproducibility of a qualified
pathologist in the acquisition and measurement of images from microscope slides
of breast cancer specimens stained for the presence of estrogen and progesterone
receptor proteins. The accuracy of the test result depends upon the quality of the
immunohistochemical staining. It is the responsibility of a qualified pathologist
to employ appropriate morphological studies and controls as specified in the
instructions for the ER and PR reagent/kit used to assure the validity of the IHC

J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy (Comparison to Manual Method):
The substantial equivalence study was based on comparison of image analysis
to conventional manual microscopy. Manual microscopy was performed in
accordance with the reagent vendor’s instructions for use.
Two Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) qualified clinical
sites participated in the study. Prior to their participation in the study each
clinical site obtained exemption status from an Institutional Review Board
(IRB).
The first clinical site participated in the ER study.
A total set of 80 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast tissue specimens
from the first clinical site was used for the ER study.
The specimens at the first clinical site were selected based on their clinical
scores on file to provide an equal distribution of ER slides in the percentage of
positive nuclei ranges 0%, 1% to 4%, 5% to 9%, 10% to 49%, and 50% to
100%.
All specimens for the ER study were immunohistochemically stained at the
first clinical site using Dako in vitro diagnostic (IVD) FDA cleared
Monoclonal Mouse Anti-Human Estrogen Receptor α (Clone 1D5) (k993957).
Both clinical sites participated in the PR study.
A total set of 180 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast tissue specimens
from both clinical sites were used for the PR study; 80 slides from the first
clinical site and 100 slides from the second clinical site.
The specimens at the first clinical site were selected based on their clinical
scores on file to provide an equal distribution of PR slides in the percentage of
positive nuclei ranges 0%, 1% to 4%, 5% to 9%, 10% to 49%, and 50% to
100%. The specimens at the second clinical site were routine specimens taken
from their clinical operation, representing the true target population of cases in
a typical clinical setting.
All specimens for the PR study were immunohistochemically stained at the
clinical sites using Dako in vitro diagnostic (IVD) FDA cleared Monoclonal
Mouse Anti-Human Progesterone Receptor (Clone PgR 636) (k020023).

The study was performed primarily at the participating clinical sites and all
parts except the scanning of glass slides were performed at their facilities
using their typical workflow. The glass slides were prepared in the sites’
clinical laboratories and read by board certified staff pathologists. For the
scanning of glass slides ScanScope XT instruments were operated in a
simulated clinical setting at Aperio (designed to be representative of a typical
lab environment).
All ScanScope XT instruments used in the study were production units and
were delivered, installed, and maintained in accordance with the approved
procedures, per Aperio’s QSPs (Quality Systems Procedures), and as
described in product documentation and labeling.
Three different board-certified pathologists at each clinical site performed a
blinded manual review of each glass slide using a conventional light
microscope. The pathologists reported the percentage of positive nuclei [0%,
1%, … 100%] and average intensity score of 0, 1+, 2+ or 3+ for each of the
reviewed glass slides.
Based on the manual microscopy average percentages of positive nuclei from
the three pathologists, the glass slides used for the ER study provided the
following percentages of positive nuclei distribution.
ER Percentage of Positive Nuclei Distribution
Percentage Clinical Site 1
0% 31
[ 1%- 5%) 2
[ 5%-10%) 2
[10%-50%) 8

Based on the manual microscopy average intensity scores from the three
pathologists, the glass slides used for the ER study provided the following
average intensity score distribution.

Based on the manual microscopy average intensity scores from the three
pathologists, the glass slides used for the PR study provided the following

Total 80 100 180
As it can be seen from the ER and PR percentage of positive nuclei
distributions, it was not possible to obtain an equal distribution of the
percentage of positive nuclei in the range from 1% to 10%. This difficulty
was founded in the limited representation of this percentage range in the true
target population of cases.
All glass slides were scanned using a different ScanScope XT instrument for
each clinical site.
After a wash-out period of over one week and subsequent randomization of
the slides, the same three pathologists at each clinical site outlined a
representative set of tumor regions for each digital slide using the ScanScope
Systems’ remote editing capability. The pathologists’ annotations of tumor
region outlines were blinded from each other.
Image analysis was performed on each slide for each of the different sets of
tumor regions outlined by the three pathologists, resulting in a separate image
analysis score for each of the three pathologists. Image analysis was run in
batch processing mode completely separated from the pathologists outlining
the tumor regions to avoid influencing the pathologists in their choice of
tumor regions. The image analysis algorithm reported the percentage of
positive nuclei [0.0%, … 100.0%] and average intensity score of 0, 1+, 2+ or
3+ for each of the digital slides.

b. Precision:
The precision of the ScanScope XT System was suite of intra-run/intra-
system, inter-run/intra-system, inter-system and intra-pathologist studies.
12 ER and 10 PR slides from the comparison study were used for this study.
Using the same slides from the comparison study allowed the results obtained
in the precision studies to be placed into perspective by comparing them to the
inter-pathologist results.
The ER slides consisted of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast tissue
specimens immunohistochemically stained using Dako in vitro diagnostic
(IVD) FDA cleared Monoclonal Mouse Anti-Human Estrogen Receptor α
(Clone 1D5) (K993957).
The PR slides consisted of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast tissue
specimens immunohistochemically stained using Dako in vitro diagnostic

(IVD) FDA cleared Monoclonal Mouse Anti-Human Progesterone Receptor
(Clone PgR 636) (K020023).
10 ER and 10 PR were selected to provide an equal distribution of slides in
the percentage of positive nuclei ranges 0%, 1% to 4%, 5% to 9%, 10% to
49%, and 50% to 100% (two slides in each of the identified ranges) using the
average percentage of positive nuclei from the three pathologists in the
comparison study.
The pathologists’ selection of tumor regions for image analysis introduces
some variability to the system. To properly assess the true variability of the
system the influence of the pathologists’ selections in the intra-run/intra-
system, inter-run/intra-system, and inter-systems studies was eliminated by
using the same tumor regions for image analysis of all scans of the same slide.
The image analysis algorithm reported the percentage of positive nuclei
[0.0%, … 100.0%] and average intensity score of 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+ as well as
the underlying average intensity on a scale from 0 to 255.
The statistical analyses are presented for ER and PR for the percentage of
positive nuclei and intensity scores.
Intra- system: The slide scores provided by image analysis over 10
consecutive scans were analyzed for all 10 ER and 10 PR slides.
Estrogen Receptor (ER)
Percentage of Positive Nuclei
The image analysis results show an overall standard deviation of 0.31%
(maximum 0.74%) and average range (maximum – minimum) of 0.71%
(maximum 2.25%) for the percentage of positive nuclei [0.0-100.0%] across
all runs.
Intensity Scores
The image analysis results show an overall standard deviation of 0.67
(maximum 1.45) and average range (maximum – minimum) of 1.18
(maximum 4.88) for the intensity values [0-255] across all runs.
Progesterone Receptor (PR)
Percentage of Positive Nuclei
The image analysis results show an overall standard deviation of 0.54%
(maximum 1.47%) and average range (maximum – minimum) of 1.06%
(maximum 4.78%) for the percentage of positive nuclei [0.0-100.0%] across
all runs.
Intensity Scores
The image analysis results show an overall standard deviation of 0.9

Inter-system: The slide scores provided by image analysis over 10
consecutive scans on three different ScanScope XT instruments were analyzed
for all 10 ER and 10 PR slides.
Estrogen Receptor (ER)
Percentage of Positive Nuclei
The image analysis results on each of the three ScanScope systems show an
overall average standard deviation of 0.31%, 0.31% and 0.35% (maximum
0.74%, 0.65%, 0.84%) and average range of 0.71%, 0.70% and 0.81%
(maximum 2.25%, 2.38%, 2.93%) for the percentage of positive nuclei [0.0-
100.0%] across all runs.
The image analysis results of the three ScanScope systems combined show an
overall average standard deviation of 0.55% (maximum 1.05%) and average
range of 1.44% (maximum 4.02%) for the percentage of positive nuclei [0.0-
100.0%] across all runs.
The image analysis results show minimal variation from one ScanScope
system to another as shown in the following table that shows the mean over all
runs of the reported percentage of positive nuclei [0.0-100.0%] for the 12 ER
slides (#S) for the three ScanScope systems.
