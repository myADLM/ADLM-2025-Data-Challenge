L. Test Principle:
The eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Test uses a solid-phase electrochemical method for
determining the genotype of patient blood specimens for the polymorphisms.
Three process blocks are required to generate a genotyping result from a patient sample. The
first is the generation of single-stranded amplified targets from a genomic DNA sample, the
second is the genotyping reaction that determines the genotype of the sample, and the third is
the acquisition and analysis of data from the genotyping reaction, and the report generation
for that sample. The eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Test provides all reagents needed for
PCR, exonuclease treatment, and genotyping.
The analysis process for each sample consists of three steps: 1) Genomic DNA isolated from
whole blood obtained using EDTA as anti-coagulant is combined with PCR Mix and Taq
polymerase enzyme and is subjected to amplification of target sequences by PCR using a
thermal cycler. 2) Amplified DNA is treated with exonuclease enzyme to generate single-
stranded target DNA. 3) Single-stranded, amplified target DNA is mixed with hybridization
and genotyping reagents, transferred to an eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Test cartridge, and
the cartridge is inserted in the eSensor® XT-8 Instrument. The instrument controls the
circulation of the sample through the cartridge containing to allow hybridization at a
controlled temperature, and then detects and genotypes the sample by voltammetry.
Genotyping of the test panel polymorphisms is achieved by a sandwich assay principle: 1)
each pair of electrodes contains a different synthetic oligonucleotide capture probe which is

complementary to one of the target DNA fragments. 2) The hybridization reagents contain
pairs of ferrocene-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide signal probes; one member of each pair
is complementary to the major allele sequence of the target polymorphism, while the second
member of the pair is complementary to the minor allele sequence. Each member of the
probe pair has a ferrocene labels with a different oxidation potential for each allele. 3)
Single-stranded, amplified target DNA hybridizes to its specific capture probe, and in turn
hybridizes to the allele-specific, ferrocene-labeled signal probe. 4) Each electrode of the
array is analyzed by voltammetry; the target polymorphism is determined by the location of
the electrode containing the capture probe, and the genotype is identified by the ratio of
signals from the allele-specific ferrocene labels. The array also includes positive and negative
controls to confirm the hybridization reaction and detect non-specific signals.
Upon completion of the test, the EEPROM chip on the cartridge contains information that
prevents its re-use with a new sample. The instrument analyzes the results and provides a
report of the test results. The operator removes the used cartridge from the XT-8 Instrument,
and that slot is ready to accept a new test.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was performed at three sites, two external and one internal. Five
genomic DNA samples covering all possible genotypes for all three alleles in the
Warfarin Sensitivity Test (see Table below) were tested in duplicate runs on a daily basis
by the same operator per site for 5 days at 3 different sites (2 external sites and 1 internal
site). The internal site performed the same reproducibility testing twice each day, using
two different operators and the same testing materials. Three kit lots were randomized
throughout the study. Overall, a combined 263 tests were performed using samples that
represented all genotypes of each polymorphism. There were 9 first pass no-calls, for an
overall first pass no-call rate of 4.5%. Following an additional round of testing of these
no-call samples, the results obtained were in 100% agreement with DNA sequencing.
There were no incorrect genotype calls in this study.
The genotypes of the samples tested in the reproducibility studies are as follows:

Overall reproducibility for all mutations was 100% after additional testing of first-pass
no-calls. The first pass no-call rate was 4.5%, and the miscall rate was 0%.
An extraction method study was carried out in order to demonstrate that personnel at
different laboratories can isolate genomic DNA starting from whole blood samples using
standard DNA purification kits and utilize that DNA in the eSensor® Warfarin
Sensitivity Test to generate correct genotype calls. Three generic DNA extraction
methods were evaluated at three different sites using aliquots of a panel of 7 whole blood
samples of different genotypes. Each site used a different extraction method, representing
examples of magnetic bead, silica membrane, and precipitation methodologies. Each site
performed three independent extractions of each blood sample and assayed them using a
single eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Test kit from the same kit lot.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability: Test kit cartridges are stable at 10-25°C for up to 3 months. Reagents are
stable at -20°C for up to 3 months. As results are obtained from ongoing real-time
stability testing, the product expiry dating will be extended based on these additional
data. Cartridges can be stored for up to 14 days after opening the foil pouches. Once
open, reagents can be stored at -20°C for up to 30 days. Reagents can be thawed up to
3 times. Whole blood stored in EDTA can be stored at 4°C for up to 4 weeks after
collection prior to extraction of gDNA for use in the eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity
Test. PCR products can be stored at 4°C or -20°C for up to 7 days. Exonuclease-
digested PCR product can be stored store at 4°C or -20°C for up to 7 days. After
combining the exonuclease-digested PCR with hybridization reagents, the
hybridization reaction can be loaded on the cartridge and held at 10-25°C for up to 8
hours before initiating hybridization of the cartridge on the XT-8 instrument.
Controls: Positive or negative sample controls are not included with this assay. It is
required that a non-template control, called a DNA Contamination Monitor, be
included with each PCR run of the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Test.
Each test contains internal positive and negative controls to assure proper functioning
of the system. Each cartridge contains two electrodes coated with a capture probe
that is complementary to a synthetic target DNA present in the hybridization mixture.
The target is in turn complementary to a control signal probe in the hybridization
mixture, and thus generates an appropriate signal in the assay. The positive control is
designed to detect a systematic failure of the hybridization and/or detection processes.
A lack of signal for the positive control indicates a genotyping assay failure. If a
correct signal is observed for the positive control, but one or more genotyping assays
are invalid due to low signals, then a failure of DNA isolation or PCR amplification is
indicated. A negative control is present on each cartridge, consisting of a capture
probe that does not hybridize to any sequence within the target DNA or signal probes.
Signals on the negative control indicate an assay system failure.

d. Detection limit:
An upper and lower limit of detection study was performed to assess the genotyping
performance of the eSensor XT-8 system across a range of genomic DNA input
concentrations.
In order to determine the lowest concentration of DNA at which this assay is
accurate, serial dilutions (1000, 100, 10, 1, 0.1 ng) of two genomic DNA samples of
different genotypes were assayed 20 times using the eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity
Test. An additional run was performed for tests that gave a first-pass no-call result.
All replicates were correctly genotyped at 0.1 ng of purified DNA per reaction, and
90% of samples gave a genotype at1000 ng of purified DNA per reaction. Results are
as summarized in the table below. The recommended range of DNA input amounts
for the eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Test is from 10 ng.

e. Analytical specificity:
Potentially interfering substances were selected based on the criteria described in the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute approved guideline EP7-A2, Interference
Testing in Clinical Chemistry and an internally-performed risk assessment.
Alternate description:
For the interference studies, 16 individual samples were treated with high concentrations
of 8 different interfering substances. Studies contained four replicates of a pooled sample
(containing 3 whole blood samples from wild-type donors) that were extracted by three
different extraction methods (and therefore 12 samples), and four replicates of a sample
(with genotype *2/*3 for 2C9) extracted by one extraction method.
Each extracted sample was tested with the eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Test.
Genotypes of all samples were confirmed by sequencing and included in the final report.

N. Instrument Name:
eSensor XT- 8 system
The basic model XT-8 instrument consists of the user interface display and a processing
tower with eight independent cartridge slots where hybridization and scanning of the
cartridge occur. The XT-8 is also available in two and three tower versions with 16 and 24
independent slots respectively. The XT-8 instrument includes several software modules
which together allow users to process genetic tests and create reports of the testing results.
The primary software module is the application software, which is what a user interacts with
while using the instrument. All of the hardware functions of the instrument are controlled by
embedded firmware under the command of the application software. A separate Assay
Analysis Module or AAM is used by the application software to create assay-specific results
and reports. By keeping these assay-specific AAMs separate from the application, they may

be individually validated and installed on an instrument without having to revalidate the
application software.
The application software and AAM were developed using C# in the Microsoft Visual Studio
.net 2.0 development framework. The embedded firmware was developed using the C
language using the Greenhills compiler for the CPU firmware and Texas Instrument Code
Composer for the DSP firmware.
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The instrument has a single mode of operation with eight hybridization slots that can run
8 different reactions at a time.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
The sponsor’s submitted software documentation demonstrated that the software design
meets the stated requirements for this device and were verified and validated in part by
testing the system with known wild type, mutant, and negative control samples
determining that signal detection configurations result in correct call/results.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Sample identification is performed through entering in the sample ID and the barcode of
the test cartridge to be used with the sample. The barcode of the cartridge is scanned as
the sample is about to be run.
5. Calibration:
The instrument does not require calibration. Quality control testing during instrument
manufacture is performed to confirm that measurement and control of temperature and
electrical current are within specification:
The operator software allows the user to confirm the thermal and electrical performance
of the system at will:
• The thermal tests cycle all slots through their useful temperature range, and
confirm that they reach thermal equilibrium within defined time limits.
• The electrical test characterizes the electronics for its linearity at many different
frequencies and voltages spanning its operational capabilities. This test is first run during
manufacturing and results of this characterization are stored in the instrument’s
permanent memory. The user may then run the same test. If the results of the user test
agree with the permanently stored data, this indicates that the electronics have not drifted
from their original state since manufacturing.
In addition to the QC and user tests, the instrument performs functional self tests each
time it is turned on. These tests confirm that the thermal sensors are functional and
communicating, that the on-board memory is working, that the switching electronics is
12

--- Page 13 ---
functional and the embedded firmware is not corrupted. If any of the tests fail, the
corresponding elements are locked out from use by the operator software.
6. Quality Control:
The eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Test on the XT-8 Instrument uses a combination of
electronic and molecular controls and validity criteria to verify the proper operation of
the system and assure the delivery of accurate results.
The eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Test provides a system of controls for proper
instrument setup and function, preparation of reagents, handling of samples, and function
of the cartridge and reagents. The criteria for control and test results comprise consistent
and stringent test for reporting of results. Furthermore, results from control tests provide
useful information to troubleshoot test failures and to identify the potential root cause(s)
and corrective action(s). A defect in product or process occurring at any step of the
process is expected to cause a failed control or a signal which does not meet the criteria
for a valid test result. In any of these cases, no result is reported, and further
troubleshooting and/or a repeat of the test is performed.
