L. Test Principle:
BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgG kit employs a panel of three antigen-coated fluoromagnetic
beads with unique fluorescent signatures to identify the presence of IgG class antibodies
to T. gondii, Rubella, and CMV antigens in a two step assay format.
Step 1: The system combines an aliquot of patient sample with sample diluent and bead
reagent then agitates the mixture at 37°C.
Step 2: Immobilized IgG antibodies are bound to a phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-
human IgG conjugate and detected by flow cytometry.
The fluorescence of the dyes determines the identity of the beads and the fluorescence of
the PE label determines the amount of antibody captured by the antigen. The device
calculates the results in relative fluorescence intensity (RFI).
Additional the ISB beads, SVB beads and a RBB beads are present in each reaction
mixture to verify detector response, the addition of serum or plasma to the reaction vessel
and the absence of significant non-specific binding in serum or plasma.
The BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgG Calibrator Set calibrates the instrument. For T. gondii and
Rubella, the calibrators provide quantitative calibration and results for patient samples
expressed in IU/mL. For T. gondii, results of ≤ 9 IU/mL are reported as negative, 10 - 11

IU/mL are reported as equivocal and ≥ 12 IU/mL are reported as positive. For Rubella,
results of ≤7 IU/mL are reported as negative, 8 and 9 IU/mL are reported as equivocal
and ≥ 10 IU/mL are reported as positive. For CMV, the calibrators provide qualitative
calibration, results with an antibody index (AI) ≤ 0.8 AI are reported as negative, results
equal to 0.9 and 1.0 AI are reported as equivocal, and results ≥ 1.1 AI are reported as
positive.
The BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgG Control Set (described above in device description)
includes a negative control as well as two multi-analyte positive controls. The BioPlex
ToRC IgG Positive Controls give positive results, with values above the cut-off for each
specific analyte. The BioPlex ToRC IgG Negative Control gives negative results, with
values below the cut-off for each specific analyte. The recommended frequency for
performing quality control is once every 24-hour testing period. Performing quality
control is also necessary after each new assay calibration and certain service procedures.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Separate internal and external reproducibility studies were conducted. The
reproducibility studies were performed for serum, EDTA- plasma and heparinized plasma
panels. The panels consisted of 10 samples for each of the 3 analytes; negative (< 50% of
the cutoff), high negative (50-80% of the cutoff), peri- cutoff (90-110% of the cutoff),
low positive (2-3x the cutoff), high positive (mid assay range) and very high positive (80-
100% of the maximum assay range) samples for each of the analytes. Additionally, a
positive control (positive for all three analytes), a negative control (negative for all 3
analytes) were tested.
External reproducibility evaluated at three U.S. sites. All samples and controls were
tested in duplicate on 2 runs per day for 5 days at each of the sites (i.e. a total of 60
replicates per sample) using different lots of the Bio-Rad BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgG
Reagent Pack and Calibrator Set.
For the internal reproducibility study, the same method repeated over 20 days (resulting
in 80 replicates). In both studies, the data was analyzed for intra-assay and inter-assay
reproducibility according to the principles described in the Clinical Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) guidance EP5-A2 (Vol. 24, No. 25). The standard deviation (SD) and
percent coefficient of variation (% CV) were calculated.
For the internal reproducibility study, the within-run precision for positive samples
ranged from 3.9% to 9.5% for T. gondii IgG, 3.0% to 5.5% for Rubella IgG, and 1.8% to
5.6% for CMV IgG. The total precision for positive samples ranged from 6.6% to 12.3%
for T. gondii IgG, 5.2% to 9.9% for Rubella IgG, and 3.8% to 8.7% for CMV IgG.

--- Page 7 ---
For the external reproducibility study, the within-run precision for positive samples, in all
matrices ranged from 3.7% to 7.7% for T. gondii IgG, 4.6% to 6.6% for Rubella IgG, and
2.5% to 5.8% for CMV IgG. The total precision for positive samples in all matrices
ranged from 4.8% to 17.6% for T. gondii IgG, 7.2% to 10.3% for Rubella IgG and 4.4%
to 12.1% for CMV IgG.
Additionally, the a panel of three Rubella IgG samples measuring at or near cut-off was
used to assess the precision within run for Rubella at three U.S. clinical sites, the samples
were tested in replicates of 40. The total precision was less than 10%
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the ToRC IgG assay over the assay’s reportable range was assessed
following the methods described in the CLSI document EP6-A. The assay ranges are T.
gondii (3 – 900 IU/mL), Rubella (1 – 250 IU/mL) and CMV (0.2 – 8.0 AI), and were
established by examining the clinical relevance of reporting high value results and the
ability of the calibration curve to discriminate sample dilutions. For each analyte 5 high
positive specimens were serially diluted in negative serum, and tested using a single lot
of the ToRC IgG kit in 4 replicates. Linear and polynomial regression analysis of IU/mL
or AI vs. sample dilution was performed to determine if the dilution curves exhibit
statistically significant non-linear regression. The results demonstrated acceptable
dilution linearity, as all recoveries were within ±20% of the predicted value.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgG assays report results as either IU/mL (T. gondii and rubella)
or an antibody index, AI, (CMV). IU/mL values are calculated by using a Rodbard 4-PL
curve fit through the six calibrator levels. AI values are calculated by using linear
regression analysis through segments of the calibration curve.
The quantitative value assignments for the Toxo and Rubella portions of the assay were
traced back to the WHO anti-Toxoplasma serum, 3rd International Standard (TOXM) and
the WHO anti-Rubella immunoglobulin, 3rd preparation of the 1st International Standard,
1996 (RUBI-1-94) respectively. Dilutions of both standards were analyzed with the
BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgG assay for T. gondii and Rubella IgG. Linearity was evaluated
based on the principles described in CLSI EP6-A. Results obtained demonstrated
acceptable dilution linearity, as all recoveries were within ±20% of the predicted value.
For Rubella, the recovered IU/mL at the standard value of 10 IU/mL (assay cut-off)
measured 11.2 IU/mL or 112% of the expected value for the BioPlex 2200, which is well
within the normal variation of the assay and standard preparation. The BioPlex Rubella
IgG assay range is 1 to 250 IU/mL. Assay linearity through this range as demonstrated
with patient samples as explained in section b, linearity and assay reportable range. Over
quantitation of >30% was observed with the BioPlex Rubella assay at a standard value of
50 IU/mL. This over quantitation is not observed with patient samples and does not
affect the clinical decision.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering Substances
The manufacturer assessed the test’s performance with potentially interfering substances
(according to CLSI Protocol EP7-A2 (Vol. 25, No. 27) by spiking samples with the
interferent or solvent (negative control) was at levels indicated in the table below. The
positive samples consisted of 20 to 30 IU/mL for T. gondii, 25-40 IU/mL of Rubella and
4.0 to 6.0 AI for CMV (prepared by mixing a pool of negative human serum with
samples positive for T. gondii, Rubella or CMV IgG). Test and control samples were
evaluated in replicates of ten. The percent change in signal for all analytes ranged from -
10.7 to 5.3%. No significant interference was observed for any of the interfering
substances in either the positive or the negative sample.

Cross-Reactivity
The manufacturer evaluated the potential cross-reactivity of the assay as follows: A panel
of ten positive specimens for each of the potential cross reactant (as determined by an
FDA cleared device), were evaluated for possible cross-reactivity with the ToRC IgG kit
for each of the three assays. Due to the high prevalence of Rubella IgG antibodies in the
normal population, the sponsor evaluated the test specimens on corresponding
commercially available EIAs. Most of the samples were high positive for each of the
potential cross-reacting agents. The study did not rule out potential cross reactivity for
CMV with some of the agents. The majority of all samples that elicited a positive result
were also confirmed positive by the corresponding commercially available EIA,
indicating reactivity to ToRC IgG antibodies rather than cross reactivity with a
potentially interfering factor. The results are presented in the table below:

f. Assay cut-off:
The manufacturer established the cutoff values for the ToRC IgG panel using 877 patient
serum samples. These samples were first tested on the predicate devices. Each sample
was classified as positive, negative or equivocal for each of these assays. Samples
equivocal on the predicate device were not used in ROC analysis or concordance
statistics. Comparisons were made for each analyte with its respective predicate test
(excluding equivocal samples) on a Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis.
The BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgG assays report results as either IU/mL (T. gondii and rubella)
or an antibody index, AI, (CMV). IU/mL values are calculated by using a Rodbard 4-PL
curve fit through the six calibrator levels. AI values are calculated by using linear
regression analysis through segments of the calibration curve.
Calibrators are prepared by blending defibrinated/delipidated human plasma units each
with known antibody activities to the antigens of the BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgG panel in a
human base matrix that does not contain IgG. Multiple calibrator levels are prepared
using gravimetric/volumetric dilution. These calibrators are used to assay characterized
patient samples using the BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgG panel. The cut-off value and
assignment of the calibrators are determined by performing concordance and Receiver
Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis, using predicate results as the standard. Analyze-
it software is used for the ROC analysis. This software does not employ an equivocal
range for the on-test condition. However the BioPlex 2200 assays have equivocal ranges,
thus there is a slight difference in the statistics generated using the Analyze-it software.
This analysis was used to assist in optimizing negative and positive agreement (relative
sensitivity and specificity), as well as overall agreement. Based on the results, calibrator
values were adjusted such that the cut-off value at time of market was equal to 12 IU/mL,
10 IU/mL, and 1.1 AI for T. gondii, rubella, and CMV IgG, respectively. Testing was
conducted internally at Bio-Rad Laboratories.
The BioPlex 2200 T. gondii, rubella and CMV IgG assays exhibited acceptable positive,
negative and overall agreement. ROC analysis displayed lower sensitivity at the set cut-
off for rubella since the ROC analysis uses all BioPlex 2200 results including those in the
equivocal range of which there were 33. The results of concordance testing and ROC
analysis validate the defined cut-offs for each of the analytes in the BioPlex ToRC IgG
panel.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The manufacturer compared the performance of the ToRC IgG kit to the VIDAS T.
gondii, Rubella, and CMV immunoassays. U.S. clinical sites tested a combined: 300
prospective samples from pregnant women (150 U.S. and 150 Europe), 1200 prospective
samples submitted for ToRC testing consisting of 400 samples for T. gondii, 400 samples
10

--- Page 11 ---
for Rubella, and 400 samples for CMV IgG testing, and 100 prospective samples from
immunocompromised/AIDS patients submitted for CMV testing. The following tables
show the combined results from all sites. Additionally a retrospective Rubella study
using preselected samples based on there reactivity on an FDA cleared Rubella IgG
detection device was performed. Two U.S. clinical sites tested a combined: 50 Rubella
IgG low positive samples (10-20 IU/ml), 50 Rubella IgG high positive samples (> 20
IU/ml) and 130 collected Rubella IgG negative samples. The results are summarized
below.

Substances).
In the serum vs. plasma experiments, the effects of EDTA and heparin
anticoagulants on the measurement of T. gondii, Rubella and CMV IgG were assessed
using 10 positive and 10 negative samples for the three analytes. Plasma values were
compared to matched serum values and anticoagulant interference was scored for
individual and mean differences. The data demonstrated no appreciable interference
from EDTA or heparin in IgG positive or negative samples in any of the Bioplex ToRC
IgG assays. Regression analyses of the matched serum and plasma pairs for all three
assays, the slope offset of serum vs. plasma quantification was less than 5%, and the R2
values were 0.9869 or greater, except for T. gondii where the R2 value for serum vs.
heparin plasma was 0.9482.
c. Comparison with CDC panels:
A correlation study was performed to evaluate the characteristics of the BioPlex
ToRC IgG kit with well-characterized, masked serum panels provided by the Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) for T. gondii (70 positives, 30 negatives), Rubella (82 positives,
18 negatives) and CMV (66 positives, 34 negatives). The BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgG kit
correctly identified all panel members.
d. CDC Rubella Low Positive Control:
A lyophilized CDC low positive control serum was prepared and tested neat and diluted
in duplicates at three clinical trial sites. The results of the neat and 1/2 diluted samples
ranged from 25-36 IU/mL and 13-20 IU/mL, respectively.
e. Comparison with Rubella and CMV Seroconversion Panels:
Four commercially available seroconversion panels were tested with the BioPlex
2200 System ToRC IgG kit to evaluate performance of the Rubella IgG and CMV IgG
assays. Each seroconversion panel member was tested once at Bio-Rad Laboratories and
the results were compared to the results provided by the manufacturer. All results are
expressed as specimen signal to cutoff ratios (S/CO). Ratios > 1 are considered reactive.
The bleed where each method became reactive is highlighted in the tables below.
