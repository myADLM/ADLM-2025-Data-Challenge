H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Platelia™ Lyme IgG Assay is a qualitative test intended for use in the
presumptive detection of human IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in human
serum or plasma (K EDTA, sodium heparin or sodium citrate). The EIA system
3
should be used to test serum or plasma from patients with a history and symptoms
of infection with B. burgdorferi. All positive and equivocal specimens should be
re-tested with a specific second-tier test such as Western blot. Positive second-
tier results are supportive evidence of infection with B. burgdorferi. The
diagnosis of Lyme disease should be made based on history and symptoms (such
as erythema migrans), and other laboratory data, in addition to the presence of
antibodies to B. burgdorferi. Negative results (either first or second-tier) should
not be used to exclude Lyme disease.

I. Device Description:
Platelia™ Lyme IgG Assay is a qualitative test for detection of IgG antibodies to
Borrelia burgdorferi in human serum or plasma. Platelia™ Lyme IgG uses an indirect
ELISA immuno-enzymatic method. Inactivated antigens of Borrelia burgdorferi B31 are
used for coating the microplate. A monoclonal antibody labeled with peroxidase which is
specific for human gamma chains (anti-IgG) is used as the conjugate. Patients samples
and controls are diluted 1/101 and then distributed to the wells of the microplate. During
this incubation of one hour at 37°C, IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi present in the
2

--- Page 3 ---
sample bind to the Borrelia antigen coated on microplate wells. After incubation,
unbound non-specific antibodies and other serum proteins are removed by washings. The
conjugate (peroxidase-labeled monoclonal antibody specific for human gamma chains) is
added to the microplate wells. During this incubation of one hour at 37°C, the labeled
monoclonal antibody binds to the serum IgG captured by the Borrelia antigen. The
unbound conjugate is removed by washings at the end of the incubation. The presence of
immuno-complexes (Borrelia Antigen, IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi, anti-IgG
conjugate) is demonstrated by the addition of an enzymatic development solution to each
well. After incubation at room temperature (+18-30°C), the enzymatic reaction is
stopped by addition of 1N sulfuric acid solution. The optical density reading obtained
with a spectrophotometer set at 450/620 nm is proportional to the amount of IgG
antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi present in the sample.
Controls Description:
The positive and negative controls are made from human serum.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Study 1: Assay precision was established at Bio-Rad. To confirm the inter
assay precision of the Platelia™ Lyme IgG assay, six samples were run twice a
day for 20 days. Each sample (2 positive, 2 low positive and 2 negative
samples) was tested according to the assessed kit's protocol (same batch used
throughout the experiment). Coefficients of variation obtained for positive
samples were less than 10%. Higher CV was obtained in the grey zone.
Study 2: Assay precision was established at Bio-Rad. To confirm the intra
assay precision of the Platelia™ Lyme IgG assay two studies were run:
o Three samples close to the cut off value were tested 20 times during the
same run, according to the assessed kit's protocol.
o Various samples spanning the assay range were tested 30 times during the
same run, according to the assessed kit's protocol.
The coefficient of variation was less than 10% for positive samples as well as
those samples close to the cut off.
Study 3: Assay reproducibility was established at two external sites and at
Bio-Rad through a panel of samples containing Lyme IgG. NYMC assayed
111 samples in triplicate and one sample in duplicate. There were six
discrepancies. MDL had three technicians assay 90 samples each. There were
four discrepancies.
The studies were acceptable for this type assay.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Not applicable
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
A study to confirm the analytical specificity of the assay was performed using
normal blood bank donor samples. Samples were collected from endemic and
4

--- Page 5 ---
non-endemic regions and tested on the Bio-Rad Platelia™ Lyme assays.
Medical Diagnostic Laboratories (MDL) tested 100 samples from Nevada,
Oregon, and Louisiana; all considered non-endemic areas. New York Medical
College (NYMC) tested 83 samples from the northeastern United States,
considered an endemic area. NYMC found a prevalence of 1.2 % for IgG.
MDL found no IgG positive samples. The results are summarized below.

Cross-reactivity: The cross-reactivity studies for the Platelia™ Lyme IgG
Assay were done by testing a panel of sixteen disease conditions including
syphilis, H. pylori, viral infections (EBV, HSV, Rubella, Toxoplasmosis,
Measles, Mumps, VZV, HIV, CMV), and inflammatory syndromes (CRP,
SLE, HAMA, RF, ANA). One specimen (syphilis) out of a total of 161
samples tested from the cross-reaction panel was positive.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Prospective study: A prospective study of discarded samples collected for
routine Lyme disease testing was conducted at Medical Diagnostic
Laboratories (MDL) and New York Medical College (NYMC). All samples
with positive or equivocal results on the Bio-Rad Platelia™ Lyme assays were
further tested by western blot (MDL -- Borrelia B31 Vira Blot from ViraMed;
NYMC -- Mardx). A summary of the results is presented below.

b. Matrix comparison:
Serum and plasma correlation studies were performed at Bio-Rad. Serum and
plasma samples collected from a given individual were tested in parallel.
Since it was impossible to obtain Lyme positive serum and plasma samples,
negative samples were supplemented with high positive Lyme IgG sample in
order to obtain various concentration levels. Plasma versus serum
comparisons were performed with a panel of 25 samples (12 negative and 13
positive or equivocal samples). See table below for a distribution of percent
difference of different types of plasma versus serum.

A large variation has been observed on negative plasma compared to negative sera but
without a change in results interpretation. However, the variation within the positive or
equivocal samples is small and did not change the results interpretation.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Sensitivity: A retrospective study to confirm the sensitivity of the assay
was conducted at NYMC. All retrospective patient samples were from their
Lyme culture studies; all were culture positive and all were seen by one of the

disease. Skin biopsied from leading edge of the Lyme rash and/or 9 ml plasma
was cultured. Tissue was ground in a micro tissue grinder with incomplete
BSK media, and a 0.3 to 0.4 mL aliquot of that was cultured in 60 mL of
modified complete BSK media. Plasma cultures were 3 mL of plasma to 60
mL of modified BSK. All positive cultures were confirmed by restriction
fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing. The samples were run on the
