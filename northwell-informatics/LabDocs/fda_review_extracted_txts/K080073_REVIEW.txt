Analyzer. Creatinine measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
renal diseases, in monitoring renal dialysis, and as a calculation basis for
measuring other urine analytes. This test is intended for use in clinical
laboratories or physician office laboratories. For in vitro diagnostic use only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
S40 Clinical Analyzer
I. Device Description:
Creatinine is a catabolic end-product produced by an irreversible loss of water from
the creatine molecule and is an intermediate in energy generation for muscle
contraction. Because the concentration of creatinine in blood increases with kidney
failure, uremia, etc., it is a key factor in diagnosis of these diseases and judging their
progress. The S-Test Creatinine Assay is based on enzymatic measurement of
creatinine, after removal of creatine from the sample.

L. Test Principle:
S Test CRE - In the first reaction, the sample creatine (which interferes with
enzymatic creatinine measurements) is decomposed into water and oxygen by
creatine amidinohydrolase, sarcosine oxidase, and catalase. In the second reaction,
the creatinine in the sample is converted to creatine by creatinine amidohydrolase and
is then converted to sarcosine by creatine amidinohydrolase. The hydrogen peroxide
produced by sarcosine oxidase, N-ethyl-N-sulfobutyl-m toluidine (ESBmT) and 4-
aminoaminoantipyrine are oxidized and condensed to a reddish-purple pigment via
peroxidase enzyme. Creatinine concentration is determined by measuring the
absorbance of the produced quinine pigment.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
In-house precision studies were conducted by testing human serum pools at
three levels. The samples were run three times a day five days using one
instrument. The three levels were assayed 2 times per run, 2 runs per day, for
a total of 22 days. Results are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range for creatinine is 0.3 to 14.8 mg/dL. This range is
supported by the limit of detection study (section M.1.d below), the method
comparison (section M.2.a below), and the linearity shown below.
Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by testing commercial
linearity standards, 5 levels each with known commercial concentrations of
creatinine. The assigned value of the highest sample was set to its mean
value. The assigned values of the other levels were calculated by multiplying
the mean value by the ratios obtained from the manufacturer. Each level was
tested in replicates of four. Results are presented below:
CRE
Sample Assigned Value mg/dL Measured Value mg/dL % Recovery
1 0.00 0.00 NA
2 0.98 0.98 99%
3 4.92 4.93 100%
4 9.83 9.85 100%
5 14.75 14.75 100%
Linear Regression: y = 1.001x - 0.000, r2 = 0.9999
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The S Test BUN cartridges are factory calibrated and traceable to the NIST
standard reference material SRM914.
The 2-D barcode printed on each cartridge provides the analyzer with lot-
specific calibration data.
Real time stability studies have been conducted. Protocols and acceptance
criteria were described and found to be acceptable. When stored at 2-8 ºC the
assay reagent is good until the expiration date.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank and Limit of Detection was determined for each analyte
by running a low sample and true blank sample for 3 days, 20 replicates/day
for a total of 60 results. The testing was split between two instruments. The
limit of detection was determined to be 0.3 mg/dL.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies to determine the effects of Unconjugated Bilirubin,
Hemolysis and Lipemia were performed. The sponsor states that interference
is considered to be significant if the analyte recovery changes by more than
10%.
Assay performance claims have been established on the S40 clinical analyzer
by testing a serum pool containing approximately 0.9 mg/dL creatinine to the
following concentrations of each interferent: Unconjugated Bilirubin - 50
mg/dL; Hemolysis - 1000 mg/dL; Triglycerides - 1210 mg/dL.
Bilirubin: No significant interference below 12.5 mg/dL. Concentrations
greater than 12.5 mg/dL bilirubin may cause interference.
Hemolysis: Negative interference occurred at all levels tested. Any level of
hemolysis may cause interference. Do not use hemolyzed specimens.
Triglycerides: Negative interference occurred at all levels tested. Any level of
lipemia may cause interference. Do not use lipemic specimens.
Lipemia (Intralipid): No significant interference.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A series of 65 serum specimens with CRE values ranging from 0.6 to 14.6
mg/dL were assayed in singlicate on the S40 Clinical Analyzer using S-Test
CRE Reagent (RC0011) (y) and the ACE Clinical Chemistry System (x).
Least-squares regression analysis (Deming) yielded the following results:
Regression Equation y = 1.016x – 0.15
Correlation Coefficient 0.9984
Std Error Est. 0.16
Confidence Interval
Slope 1.002 to 1.031

Further studies were done in four separate POL sites. These studies were
conducted by personnel without formal medical technology education. The

b. Matrix comparison:
A study was performed by running 29 CRE determinations on paired samples
drawn from the same patients in serum and heparin plasma tubes at two POL
labs. These collections occurred on five separate days. Because samples with
high CRE levels occur very rarely at POL sites, six samples were spiked with
a solution containing a high level of creatinine. The serum results ranged
from 0.6 to 13.6 mg/dL. Least-squares regression analysis (Deming) yielded
the following results:
Regression Equation y = 1.004x - 0.02
Correlation Coefficient 0.9983

Confidence Interval Slope 0.980 to 1.027
