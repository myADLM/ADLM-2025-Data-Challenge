L. Test Principle:
The Elecsys Anti-TSHR immunoassay is a three step competition principle
immunoassay with streptavidin-coated microparticles and electrochemiluminescence
detection. Results are determined using a calibration curve that is generated
specifically on each instrument by a 2 point calibration and master curve provided
with the reagent bar code.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the Elecsys® Anti-TSHR Test System was evaluated on
Elecsys® 2010/cobas e® 411 Immunoassay Analyzer according to CLSI
EP5-A2 guideline. The protocol consisted of testing 2 replicates of each
control (PreciControl 1 and PreciControl 2) and 2 replicates each of 4 human
serum samples per run, 2 runs per day for 21 days (2 replicates x 2 runs per
day x 21 days = 84) Within run precision and total precision was calculated
according to EP5-A2.
Within Run precision was:
Concentrations of 1.5 - 5 IU/L: CV < 10 %
Concentrations of 5 - 20 IU/L: CV < 3 %

Concentrations of 5 - 20 IU/L: CV < 5 %
Concentrations of 20 - 40 IU/L: CV < 6 %
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The measuring range is 0.8 – 40 IU/L (defined by the limit of detection and
the maximum of the master curve). Performance information at the low end
of the assay range is summarized in the Detection Limit section below.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values:
Standardized against NIBSC 1st IS 90/672 Standard. Stability for controls
and calibrators is 15 months at 2-8º C
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank and limit of detection were determined in accordance with
the CLSI EP17-A requirements.
The limit of blank (LoB)(≤ 0.5 IU/L) is the 95th percentile value from n ≥ 60
measurements of analyte free samples over several independent series. The
limit of blank corresponds to the concentration below which analyte-free
samples are found with a probability of 95%.
The limit of detection (LoD)(≤ 0.8 IU/L) is determined based on the limit of
blank and the standard deviation of low concentration samples. The limit of
detection corresponds to the lowest analyte concentration which can be
detected (value above the limit of blank with a probability of 95%).
The limit of quantitation (LoQ)(0.9 IU/L) is the lowest analyte concentration
that can be reproducibly measured with a between-run coefficient of
variation of ≤ 20%. It has been determined using low concentration anti-
TSHR samples.
Because the %CV of low concentration samples is high, values below the
LoQ should be reported with caution. The package insert states: “When
reporting values < 0.9 IU/L, the client report should be annotated with the
following information. ‘Values < 0.9 IU/L are not reliable as the between-
run coefficient of variation is > 20%.”
e. Analytical specificity:
The specificity of the Elecsys Anti-TSHR was determined using human
serum samples spiked with potential cross-reactant compounds. The results
obtained:
No cross-reactivity observed with:
• Anti-TG if less than 4000 IU/mL

--- Page 5 ---
• Anti-TPO if less than 600 IU/mL
• Human TSH if less than 1000 mIU/L
• Human LH if less than 10,000 mIU/mL
• Human FSH if less than 10,000 mIU/mL
• hCG if less than 50,000 mIU/mL
f. Interferences:
Effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of endogenous interfering
substances using the Elecsys® Anti-TSHR Immunoassay was determined on
Elecsys® 2010/cobas e® 411 Immunoassay Analyzer using natural (low
analyte concentration) and spiked serum sample pools. The assay is
unaffected by:
• Bilirubin: < 25 mg/dL
• Hemoglobin: < 0.4 g/dL
• Intralipid: < 1500 mg/dL
• Biotin: < 10 ng/mL
• rheumatoid factors: < 600 IU/mL
g. Assay cut-off:
In an external study using the Elecsys Anti-TSHR assay on samples from
436 apparently healthy individuals, 210 patients with thyroid diseases
without diagnosis of Graves’ disease, and 102 patients with untreated
Graves’ disease an optimal cut-off of 1.75 IU/L was determined. At this cut-
off the sensitivity was calculated at 97% and the specificity at 99%. The
calculated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve had an area under
the curve (AUC) of 0.99.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed to compare the Elecsys Anti-
TSHR values obtained with both the Elecsys® 2010/cobas e® 411 and
MODULAR ANALYTICS E170/cobas e® 601 Immunoassay Analyzer (Y-
axis) to the values obtained with the predicate device BRAHMS LUMItest
TRAK human (X-axis). The results were calculated using the
Passing/Bablok.
Cohort:
The cohort consisted of 350 individuals who were clinically classified as
having various thyroid disease states, Graves’ disease (mostly treated for
longer than 6 months), Hashimoto thyroiditis, chronic thyroiditis (goiter, non
autoimmune thyroiditis), adenomas or other thyroid diseases.
138 samples were outside the reportable range of the BRAHMS LUMItest
TRAK human assay (< 1 IU/L or > 40 IU/L) and/or samples outside the
reportable range of the Elecsys Anti-TSHR assay (< 0.8 IU/L or > 40 IU/L)
and were therefore excluded from the regression analysis.

The analysis of the 138 samples which were outside of the measuring range
of the predicate device (< 1 IU/L or > 40 IU/L) and/or outside of the
measuring range of the Elecsys Anti-TSHR immunoassay (< 0.8 IU/L or >
40 IU/L) shows the following distribution:

Of the 11 samples positive for anti-TSHR but equivocal for TSAb, two had
anti-TSHR values from 1.75-2 IU/L and nine had values above 2 IU/L. Of

below 1 IU/L and 20 had values from 1- 1.75 IU/L.
