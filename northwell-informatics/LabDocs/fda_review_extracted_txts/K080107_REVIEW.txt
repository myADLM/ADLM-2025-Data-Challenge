K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S18) “Methods
for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard”
L. Test Principle:
Each VITEK®2 test card contains 64 microwells. A control well, that contains only
microbiological culture medium is resident on all cards, with the remaining wells
containing premeasured amounts of a specific antibiotic combined with culture
medium. A suspension of organism is made in 0.45-0.5% sterile saline from a pure
culture and standardized to a McFarland 0.5 standard using the DensiChek. The
desired cards are placed in the cassette along with an empty tube for the susceptibility
card. The cassette is placed in the VITEK®2 instrument where a susceptibility test
will be automatically diluted from the ID suspension by the VITEK®2. The cards are
then automatically vacuum filled; the tubes are cut and the cards sealed prior to
proceeding to the Incubator Loading Station. Cards are then transferred from the
cassette into the carousel for incubation (35.5o C) and optical scanning during testing.
Readings are performed every 15 minutes. In addition to the automatic dilution,
there is also a manual inoculation dilution procedure described in the packager insert.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Two AST (TZP1 and TZP2) will be identified in the product labeling (package inserts
and the VITEK®2 System Product Information, Susceptibility Performance
Characteristics). TZP1 will identify information related to the original test
(N50510/S119) and TZP2 will identify information related to this submission.
This submission is for the AST Panel only. The ID System was not reviewed.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates at 3 sites on 3 separate
days in triplicates. The study included the Auto-dilution and the Manual
dilution. All results were >95% reproducible and acceptable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
Three recommended QC (E. coli ATCC 25922, E. coli
ATCC 35218 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853) were tested a
minimum 20 times/site by the automatic dilution and the manual
dilution. The organisms were tested by the VITEK 2 AST cards and
the reference (broth microdilution) methods.

The following table provides the frequency of results for all sites in
each concentration with the expected range stated. Both the Auto
dilution and the Manual dilution methods are within the expected
range >95% of the time. The Reference Results are similar to the test
results. In instances where any organism was out of range for the
reference method, all testing data was invalid and repeated.

Inoculum density control:

to the turbidity of 0.5 McFarland. The VITEK 2 DensiChek instrument
was standardized weekly with all results recorded and in the expected
range. Verification was performed during internal testing.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical study was performed at three external sites using the VITEK 2
AST-GN Piperacillin/tazobactam and broth microdilution panels
containing Piperacillin/tazobactam. The study included 483 clinical
isolates (269 fresh, 214 stock) and a challenge set of 79 isolates. The
clinical stock isolates were <50%. Two methods of inoculation
(manual and automated) were evaluated. Clinical testing was
performed by the automated method of inoculation and the challenge
set was by both the manual and the automated methods. All isolates
grew in the VITEK®2 cards in less than 16 hours. The test device had
a growth rate of >95% for the clinical and the challenge study.
The vmj was 2.3% (4/176). Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter
baumannii, E. coli and K. pneumoniae each had one vmj. There is no
intermediate category in the interpretative criteria for P. aeruginosa so
all discrepant results are either very major error (vmj) or a major error
(maj), even the result is within EA. The vmj was within EA. The vmj
for Acinetobacter baumannii and K. pneumoniae were 1.3% (1/76) and
1.4% (1/71) respectively. They all had an acceptable EA and CA of
>90%.
