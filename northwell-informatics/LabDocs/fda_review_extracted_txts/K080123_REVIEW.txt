L. Test Principle:
Glucose – The analyzer automatically separates the plasma from whole blood for
testing. The plasma is separated using centrifugation carried out in a measurement
disk on the instrument. The plasma is then transferred to another cell on the
measurement disk where the reaction takes place. When a sample is mixed with the
enzyme and ATP reagent, the glucose in the sample yields glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-
P) and adenosine-5’-diphosphate (ADP). The G-6-P is converted in the presence of
NAD. By measuring the increase in absorbance at 340 nm, the glucose concentration
in the sample is determined.
HbA1c - A whole blood sample is dispensed onto the measurement disk. The sample
is then diluted and hemolyzed. The hemolyzed solution is transferred to another cell
on the measurement disk where the reaction takes place. When the sample is mixed
with anti-HbA1c reagent a soluble antigen-antibody complex is formed. HbA1c
polyhapten binds with excess antibodies and the resulting agglutination complex is
measured turbidimetrically. The degree of turbidity is proportional to the
concentration of excess anti HbA1c antibody and is inversely proportional to the
concentration of HbA1c in the sample. Hemoglobin concentration is determined in a
second cell by measuring the absorbance of Hemoglobin diluted with buffer reagent.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision was conducted in-house using three heparinized whole
blood samples. Samples 1 and 2 were naturally occurring whole blood
samples. Sample 3 was a whole blood sample spiked with analyte. Each
sample was tested 21 times in one day. Results are presented in the table
below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity range for each assay was assessed by diluting whole blood
samples for each analyte. Sample one for each analyte covered the assay’s low
range and was diluted with saline to obtain 5 additional samples. The second
sample for each analyte was used to cover the assay’s high range. A whole
blood sample was spiked then diluted with whole blood to obtain additional
samples. The dilutions were assayed and the percent recovery was calculated.
The measuring range for each assay is Glucose 18-370 mg/dL and HbA1c
3.0%-16.5%. The results are presented below:

Spiked Recovery
Unspiked heparinized whole blood samples at three different concentrations
for GLU 45, 56 and 186 mg/dL and for HbA1c 3.5, 5.9 and 5.9 % were used.
The base samples were assayed to obtain the concentration of glucose and
HbA1c in the samples. Increasing amounts of HbA1c coming from a high
sample and glucose were added to the samples and were assayed. The
concentrations were measured and the percent recovery was calculated. The
recovery for glucose ranged from 96-104% and HbA1c from 100-110%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
APOLOWAKO HbA1c assay is traceable to the Diabetes control and
Complications Trail (DCCT) Method for measurement of HbA1c. HbA1c
values are reported according to the National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program (NGSP) at the DCCT level.
The sponsor has documented traceability to the NGSP’s recommended
accuracy base for Hgb A1c by performing a direct comparison with a
Secondary Reference Laboratory (SRL) using 40 fresh human specimens.
NGSP certifications expire after one year.
APOLOWAKO glucose assay is traceable to the NIST SRM917B standard.
The sponsor recommends using commercially available assayed liquid
controls..
Real time stability studies have been conducted. Protocols and acceptance
criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims
the following expiration date:
When stored unopened at 2-10 ºC, the assay reagent is good until the
expiration date.

--- Page 9 ---
After opening, the assay reagent is good on board for 28 days when stored at
2-10 ºC.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank and the Limit of Detection for each analyte was
determined by running a true blank sample and four low samples. Each
sample was assayed in 15 replicates in one day. The testing was performed on
one instrument by one operator. The detection limits are 0.7 mg/dL glucose
and .099% for HbA1c. See the linearity section above for the measuring range
of each analyte.
e. Analytical specificity:
Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could
interfere with the each method. Sponsor states that a substance was considered
to show no significant interference if the difference between test sample and
the blank sample was <10%. Each analyte was found to have no significant
interference at the concentration listed below:
Glucose HbA1c
Highest Level Tested Highest Level Tested

Ascorbic acid 50 mg/dL 50 mg/dL
EDTA-2NA 0.5% 0.5%
Heparin sodium 0.1% 0.1%
Sodium fluoride 2.0% N/A
To study the interference from labile A1c on the assay, two heparinized whole
blood samples representing normal and diabetic A1c levels were split into
aliquots. Each sample was spiked with glucose to various concentrations
ranging from 200-1000 mg/dL. The samples were incubated for three hours at
37°C to facilitate formation of labile A1c. The samples were assayed on the
APOLOWAKO analyzer. Sponsor states that the potential interferents tested
showed <10% interference at the concentrations tested.
The sponsor claimed that Hemoglobin variants such as Hgb S, C, E and
Chicago do not affect their device. Their method does not have interference
on these Hgb variants according to the literature. Reference: ”National
