H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The APOLOWAKO T-CHO is for the quantitative determination on the APOLOWAKO
analyzer of total cholesterol (T-CHO) in whole blood. The APOLOWAKO HDL-C is for
the quantitative determination on the APOLOWAKO analyzer of HDL cholesterol in
whole blood. The APOLOWAKO TG is for the quantitative determination on the
APOLOWAKO analyzer of triglycerides in whole blood. In conjunction with the above
values, the APOLOWAKO analyzer calculates LDL cholesterol for triglyceride values up
to 400 mg/dL and T-CHO/HDL-C ratio.
APOLOWAKO Analyzer is a discrete photometric chemistry analyzer for clinical use in
both central laboratories and in point of care sites. The device is intended to duplicate
manual analytical procedures by automatically performing various steps such as
pipetting, mixing and measuring color intensity. This device is intended for use in
conjunction with certain materials to measure a variety of analytes of clinical interest in
whole blood samples.
The measurements of total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL
cholesterol (by calculation for triglycerides up to 400 mg/dL) when used in conjunction
with other biochemical markers and coronary risk factors, is useful in the prediction of
CHD/CVD risk and the assessment of CHD/CVD severity.

L. Test Principle:
The analyzer automatically separates the plasma from whole blood for testing. The plasma is
separated using centrifugation carried out in a measurement disk on the instrument. The
plasma is then transferred to another cell on the measurement disk where the reaction takes
place.
Total Cholesterol (T-CHO) uses an enzymatic reaction using cholesterol oxidase and
cholesterol esterase which in the presence of peroxidase produces a blue pigment which is
read colorimetrically. The amount of total cholesterol contained in the sample is proportional
to the absorbance of the blue color.
HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) uses a two step assay. The first step is an antibody inhibition
assay which the antibody in the pretreatment reagent binds to lipoproteins (LDL, VDRL and
chylomicrons) in the sample. The second step is an enzymatic reaction using cholesterol
esterase and cholesterol oxidase in the presence of peroxidase produces a blue color complex
which is read colorimetrically. The amount of HDL-C contained in the sample is proportional
to the absorbance of the blue color.
Triglyceride (TG) uses a two step assay. The first step is the removal of free glycerol in the
sample using glycerolkinase, glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase and a catalase. The second step is
an enzymatic reaction which uses lipoprotein lipase, glycerol lipase and glycerol-3-phosphate
oxidase which in the presence of peroxidase which produces a blue pigment and is read
colorimetrically. The amount of triglyceride contained in the sample is proportional to the
absorbance of the blue color.
LDL-cholesterol is a calculation using the Friedewald equation where,
LDL = (T-CHO) – (HDL-C) - (0.2 x TG)
For a TG value >400 no result will report for the LDL-cholesterol.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The measuring ranges of the assays are T-CHO 25-330 mg/dL, TG 30- 625 mg/dL
and HDL-C 8-100 mg/dL. The linearity of the T-CHO, TG and HDL-C
measurements was demonstrated for each assay by diluting whole blood samples for
each analyte to span the range. The samples ranged in concentration for each analyte
as follows T-CHO 27-340 mg/dL, TG 20-745 mg/dL and HDL 5.1-105 mg/dL. The
samples were assayed and the percent recovery and linear regressions were
calculated. The results are presented in the table below:

46, 136 and 288 mg/dL, TG 44, 69 and 348 mg/dL and HDL-C 25, 41 and 47 mg/dL
were used. Increasing amounts of cholesterol, triglyceride and HDL were added and
samples (spiked and unspiked) were assayed. The concentrations were measured and
the percent recovery was calculated for the spiked samples. The recovery for total
cholesterol is 95-103%, Triglyceride 100-103% and HDL-cholesterol 98-106%.

Sponsor recommends using commercially available liquid assayed control materials.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank and the Limit of Detection for each analyte was determined by
running a true blank sample and four low samples. Each sample was assayed in 1 day,
15 replicates. The testing was performed on one instrument by one operator. The
detection limits are 1.7 mg/dL for Total Cholesterol, 2.0 mg/dL for Triglyceride and
.13 mg/dL for HDL-cholesterol. See linearity above for measuring ranges of each
analyte.
e. Analytical specificity:
Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could interfere
with the each method. Whole blood samples were spiked with varies analyte
concentrations. Sponsor states that a substance was considered to show no significant
interference when the test sample compared to the blank samples is <10%. Each
analyte was found to have no significant interference at the concentration listed

N. Instrument Name:
APOLOWAKO Analyzer
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The APOLOWAKO analyzer is a fully-integrated POC test system that can perform up to
six analytical tests per individual patient sample. The sample is venous whole blood. To
perform a test, place a measurement disk in the analysis compartment and the sample in
the sample holder. Close the cover and press start, the analyzing process is fully
automated. Only one sample is run at a time. The measurement disk is single use and
must be replaced with each sample.
All of the reagents have a reagent information tag applied to the back of each bottle
which controls the calibration, reagent quantity, shelf-life and lot number.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:

Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Automatically assigned by the instrument or can come from an external PC. Only one
sample is analyzed at a time.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Venous whole blood – EDTA or Heparin
5. Calibration:
A calibration is performed automatically when a new reagent is placed on the instrument
and is good for 28 days. Two calibration methods are used on the instrument; linear
method two-point and multi-point. For the two-point linear calibration the calibrator
absorbance is compared with the reference absorbance. If the difference is out of the
allowable range the reagent is made unusable. The reference absorbance and allowable
range are written onto the reagent tag. A new multi-point calibrations curve is plotted
based on the measured calibrator absorbance and the calibration curve information on the
reagent information tag. Again this information is written onto the reagent tag. The new
ranges are now used as the standard curve for reactions on the instrument.
6. Quality Control:
Internal quality control automatically checks the reagent (reagent tag), dispensing system,
measurement disk and processes so that results are not given when any errors occur.
Two levels of external quality control materials are recommended and laboratories should
follow federal, state and local guidelines.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
APOLOWAKO uses the on-board test function “Serum Index” to analyze samples for
hemolysis, icterus and/or lipemia. This serum test is a spectrophotometric assay for
interferants; it functions using absorbance test results on the plasma from the patient sample.
Serum Index is a routine test run on each sample. A sample exceeding the upper limit of the
acceptable range for each interferant is not further analyzed. For example, patient samples
hemolyzed to an Hb concentration above the highest non-interfering Hb concentration (500
mg/dL) are then given an error code “R” and analysis on that sample does not proceed. See
section 6.5 “Measurement Errors” in the Technical Reference Guide. Three error codes, “R”,
“Y” and “T”, are shown for the “serum information error” for hemoglobin, bilirubin and
lipemia (turbidity), respectively.
11

--- Page 12 ---
The wavelengths used are 340 nm, 405 nm and 450 nm. These results are then subjected to
on-board analysis by the APOLOWAKO software to determine the concentration of
hemoglobin, bilirubin and the degree of turbidity like Triglyceride turbidity.
Note that the highest acceptable extent of each interference state corresponds to the highest
amount shown not to interfere. That value is also presented in the package insert. The cut
points that generate the error message are:
Lipemia >1000 mg/dL Triglyceride
Icterus >50 mg/dL Bilirubin
Hemolysis >500 mg/dL Hemoglobin
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
