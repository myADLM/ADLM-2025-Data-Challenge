H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
For use in the verification of the calibration established by the Elecsys proBNP II
reagent on the Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.
The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” is intended for use on the
Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Elecsys or Cobas e immunoassay analyzer
I. Device Description:
The Elecsys proBNP II CalCheck is a lyophilized product consisting of NT-proBNP
(1-76) amide human serum and potassium phosphate buffered matrix. During
manufacture the analytes are spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration
levels. In the labeling the sponsor states that each donor unit was tested for hepatitis
B surface antigen, antibodies to hepatitis C and antibodies to HIV and found to be
negative.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Elecsys proBNP CalCheck
2. Predicate K number(s):
k020883

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Values are assigned by multiple analyses on multiple analyzers. Runs are
calibrated against reference standards produced by weighing in pure synthetic
NT-proBNP (1-76) amide in a human serum matrix. The target value is
calculated as the median of the determined values.
Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to
be acceptable. The CalCheck is stable until the expiration date printed on the
vial when stored unopened at 2 – 8° C. Reconstituted vials are stable for four
hours at 25°C.
