--- Page 2 ---
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
The sponsor’s stated limitations in the labeling are as follow:
a. The anticonvulsant drug phenytoin may interfere with total and free T4 levels
due to competition for TBG binding sites.
b. FT4 values may be decreased in patients with non-thyroidal conditions and in
patients taking carbamazepine.
c. Performance of this assay has not been established with neonatal specimens.
d. Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with reagent
immunoglobulins, interfering with in vitro immunoassays. Patients routinely
exposed to animals or to animal serum products can be prone to this
interference and anomalous values may be observed. Additional information
may be required for diagnosis.
e. Thyroid auto antibodies in human serum may interfere and cause falsely
elevated FT4 results.
4. Special instrument requirements:
ADVIA Centaur and ADVIA Centaur XP Systems
I. Device Description:
The ADVIA Centaur Free T4 (FT4) Immunoassays are adaptations of the ACS:180,
ADVIA Centaur Free T4 (FrT4) Immunoassays. The ADVIA Centaur Free T4 (FT4)
Immunoassay consists of two reagents. The Lite Reagent is an acridinium ester
labeled T4 derivative. It is diluted to a concentration of about 0.2 ug/mL in sodium
barbital buffer (1.03%) with protein stabilizers, EDTA and sodium azide (<0.1%).
The solid phase is a biotinylated polyclonal rabbit anti-T4 antibody (0.525 ug/mL)
that is coupled to avidin covalently linked to paramagnetic particles. The particles are
diluted in sodium barbital buffer (1.03%) with protein stabilizers, EDTA and sodium
azide (<0.1%).

L. Test Principle:
The FT4 immunoassays are competitive immunoassays using direct
chemiluminescent technology. FT4 in the patient sample competes with acridinium
ester labeled T4 in the Lite Reagent for a limited amount of biotinylated polyclonal
rabbit-anti T4 that is coupled to avidin covalently linked to paramagnetic particles.
There is an inverse relationship between the concentration of free thyroxine in the
sample and relative light units.

The ADVIA Centaur FT4 assay utilizes a factory set master curve generated by the
FT4 master curve standards. The master curve values are contained on the master
curve card provided with each kit. The barcode reader or keyboard is used to enter the
master curve values on the system. The 2 calibrators in the kit are assayed when the
lot is first used or after expiration of the calibrator interval. If the calibration run is
valid as determined by prearranged parameters, the values are stored and used to
“normalize” test values to the master curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
An internal precision protocol, using serum and control samples, based on a
modification of CLSI EP5-2A, was used: A precision study was done with 27
runs over 16 days with three reagent lots on four ADVIA Centaur systems, 1-
4 runs per day, n=3 per run for a total of n = 81 for each sample. Coefficient
of Variation was calculated as shown below:
Within-run Total
Specimen Level (ng/dL) SD CV (%) SD CV (%)
Serum 1 0.37 0.0300 8.11 0.0414 11.2
Control 1 0.71 0.0233 3.28 0.0344 4.85
Control 2 1.31 0.0449 3.43 0.0521 3.98

Serum 3 9.68 0.4327 4.47 0.6321 6.53
An additional study using low level patient samples pool was assayed as part
of the study. This sample was tested over 4 days, 20 replicates per day on 1
system. The precision of this low sample was comparable to the low samples
in the other studies. The results are presented in the table below;
Within-run Total
Specimen Level (ng/dL) SD CV (%) SD CV (%)
Serum Pool 0.206 0.0214 10.4 0.0214 10.4
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Twelve samples prepared in a commercial human serum matrix containing
USP material at various concentrations were tested. The FT4 concentrations
of the samples tested ranged from 0 to12.50 ng/dL (Expected Values). The
recovery of each sample was measured using 5 replicates at each level.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ADVIA Centaur FT4 assay is traceable to an internal standard
manufactured using U.S.P. (United States Pharmacopeia) material. Assigned
values of calibrators and ranges of Ligand Plus controls are traceable to this
standardization.
On-board stability experiments showed that the reagent is stable for 28 days at
2-8oC, and the sponsor requires that it is calibrated every 7 days.
The calibrator and control materials were cleared in previous submissions as
follows:
Calibrator A (k970539), Ligand Plus Control (k030452).
d. Detection limit:
Sponsor determined the Limit of Blank (LoB) and the Limit of Detection
(LoD) for the ADVIA Centaur FT4 by assaying a zero sample and a low
sample (pool of patient samples) in the following manner:
Eighty replicates of each sample were tested in 4 runs over 4 days, with 20
replicates per run. The results of the study are shown below.

samples)
LoD = 0.0323 + (1.645 x 0.0258) + (1.645 x 0.0242) = 0.12 ng/dL

e. Analytical specificity:
i.) Cross-reactivity studies:
The cross-reactivity of the ADVIA Centaur FT4 assay with a substance
has been expressed as the ratio of:
• The amount of T4 required to displace 50% of the maximally bound
labeled T4 from the anti-T4 antibody, and
• The amount of the cross-reactant to give the same 50% displacement -

ii.) Endogenous substances:
The effect of albumin (up to 4.9 g/dL), hemoglobin (up to 300 mg/dL),
lipemic (up to 1000 mg/dL of triglyceride) and icteric (up to 20 mg/dL of
free and conjugated bilirubin) was evaluated by testing patient samples
with two levels of FT4 (0.91 ng/dL and 1.40 ng/dL)and comparing the
results to the Predicate Device on the ACS:180 and ADVIA Centaur. All
the studies met the sponsor’s internal acceptance criteria and no significant
interference was seen with the above tested compounds at the levels
tested. Less than 10% interferences are considered to be not significant by
the sponsor.
iii.) Drug interferences:
Known amounts of propylthiouracil (4.0 mg/dL), methimazole (0.40
mg/dL), phenylbutazone (15.0 mg/dL), phenytoin (4.00 mg/dL), sodium
salicylate (50.0 mg/dL) and aspirin (50.0 mg/dL) were added to serum
samples containing 0.91 to 6.10 ng/dL of FT4 and tested in the ADVIA
Centaur FT4 assay. The percent change to the dose by the addition of the
substance was determined. Phenylbutazone was found to result in an
average % change of 6.38%, while all others resulted in changes below 0.2
and 4%. All results passed the sponsor’s internal acceptance criteria of
≤10% (average % change) as an acceptable level of interference.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Correlation studies were performed with the ADVIA Centaur FT4 assay using
the predicate ACS:180 FrT4 immunoassay as the comparative method. The
correlation studies were done over 10 days using 237 patient serum samples.
The sample distribution is described below.
Sample Type Number Tested
(natural samples) Sample Range (~ 0.14 – 11.14
ng/dL)
Normal 132
(~ 0.70 – 2.12 ng/dL)
Hypothyroid* 80

Hyperthyroid* 71
(~ 0.99 – 11.14 ng/dL)
Total 283
*Internally classified based on vendor’s TSH Values - not clinically confirmed
Samples ranged from FT4 concentrations of 0.14 ng/dL to 11.14 ng/dL. Data
were plotted as single values, and the regression analysis yielded the
following:
y = 0.973x + 0.016 with an r2 value of 0.995.
b. Matrix comparison:
The serum/plasma equivalence study was carried out using lithium heparin
and K EDTA plasma samples and their corresponding serum samples.
2
Samples were collected from self-described healthy volunteers. 91 matched
heparinized plasma samples were compared with serum with T4 values
ranging from 0.17-11.4 ng/dL. Samples include natural samples, and spiked in
order to cover the hard to find sample range. Mean % bias was found to be
4.33 %. Linear regression of the data yielded the following values:
y= 0.979x + 0.058, n=91, r=0.997.
In another study, 73 matched K EDTA plasma samples were compared with
2
serum with T4 values ranging from 0.17-11.4 ng/dL. Samples include natural
samples and spiked samples in order to cover the hard to find sample range.
Mean % bias was found to be -2.25 %. Linear regression of the data yielded
the following values:
y=0.967x + 0.007, n=73, r=0.998.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected results for the ACS:180® FrT4 assay were previously established.
Data was obtained on serum samples from 388 apparently healthy individuals.
Based on this population, the following reference ranges were established:
Clinical FT4 Range (ng/dL) FT4 Range (pmol/L)
Condition
Euthyroid 0.89 – 1.76 11.5 – 22.7
Hypothyroid less than 0.89 less than 11.5
Hyperthyroid greater than 1.76 greater than 22.7
The sponsor claims that these expected values are transferrable to the ADVA
Centaur FT4 assay by analyzing 283 samples in the range of 0.14 to 11.1 ng/dL in
the method comparison study above and obtaining a linear regression equation of
Y = 0.979X + 0.058, n=91, r=0.997 with a mean bias of 4.33%.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
