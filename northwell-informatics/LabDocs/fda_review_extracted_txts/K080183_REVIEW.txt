The Control Set Amphetamine 1000 is for use as an assayed control with the
Roche Abuscreen OnLine assay for Amphetamines and the COBAS INTEGRA
Amphetamines cobas c pack (AMPS) for the qualitative and semiquantitative
determination of amphetamines in human urine on automated clinical chemistry
analyzers.

Abuscreen OnLine assay for Amphetamines and the COBAS INTEGRA
Amphetamines cobas c pack (AMPS) for the qualitative and semiquantitative
determination of amphetamines in human urine on automated clinical chemistry
analyzers.
2. Indication(s) for use:
See Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Prescription Use Only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Roche/Hitachi 911/912/917/MODULAR P analyzers
Roche/Hitachi cobas c 501/c 311

I. Device Description:
These are drug mixture control materials in a human urine matrix. The three sets of
controls (Control Set DAT I, II and III) each have two levels of various drug-control
mixtures, while the amphetamine controls have two levels of d-amphetamine and are
sold ready for use and no preparation is required. The sponsor recommends that
before use, the user record the date the control was opened on the bottle label.
Donors for the pools of human urine used in the preparation of this product all
screened negative in annual serum testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg),
and for antibodies to HIV type 1, HIV type 2, and hepatitis C (anti-HCV).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The assigned values of the Control Set DAT I, Control Set DAT II, Control
Set DAT III, and Control Set Amphetamine 1000, Control Set Amphetamine
500 are traceable to Gas Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS)
Reference Testing. For each analyte the GC-MS is calibrated with master
calibrators. These are made fresh from a concentrated stock stored at -20ºC.
The concentration of the frozen stock is verified every three months by an
independent GC-MS laboratory. Five calibrator levels are used to generate the
calibration curve on the GC-MS.
The material has a closed vial stability claim of 12 months. Real Time
stability was assessed by GC/MS testing of unopened, refrigerated vials.
After opening the reagents are good for 30 days or until the expiration date,
whichever comes first at 2-8°C.
