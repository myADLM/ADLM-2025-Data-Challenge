L. Test Principle:
The assay principle is a two-step immunoassay sandwich method measuring a fluorescent
signal. A solid-phase receptacle (SPR) serves as solid support to which anti-CEA monoclonal
antibody (derived from mouse) is coated. Serum specimen, calibrator, or control samples are
incubated in the SPR to allow capture of bound material to the solid phase. Unbound
components are washed away during a washing step. Alkaline-phosphatase labeled anti-CEA
polyclonal antibody (goat derived) is added and incubation begun. During incubation labeled
anti-CEA binds to solid-phase captured CEA. Unbound material is washed away during a
second wash step. The substrate (4-methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate is added to the SPR and
cycled in and out. During this incubation the enzyme catalyzes a reaction in which a
fluorescent product is produced (4-methyl-umbelliferone) and measured at 450 nm by the
VIDAS analyzer. The intensity of fluorescence is proportional to the concentration of CEA
present in the sample. Fluorescence intensity is converted to a concentration by comparison
with a signal generated by known concentrations of CEA in calibrators. The final
concentration is printed by the analyzer.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three serum samples were assayed in duplicate in 40 runs, 2 runs per day for 20 days
with 2 reagent lots at 3 sites. Kit controls and 2 levels of a commercially available
tumor marker control (Bio-Rad) were run in each run as quality control checks. The
mean CEA concentration, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation (%CV)
were calculated for each stated source of variation. The %CV for day-to-day variation
ranged from 1.2% to 4.5% across sites, lots, and CEA concentrations. The %CV for
run-to-run variation ranged from 0% to 1.6% across sites, lots, and CEA
concentrations. The %CV for intra-assay variation ranged from 2.7% to 5.3% across
sites, lots, and CEA concentrations. The total variability across all sites and samples
ranged from 3.9% to 6.5% across sites, lots, and CEA concentrations. The sponsor
concludes that the %CV of total variation across sites and samples was ≤ 5.6%.
Inter-run imprecision Mean 3.4 ng/mL %CV 2.7% to 4.4%
Mean 25 ng/mL %CV 3.5% to 4.4%
Mean 160 ng/mL %CV 3.7% to 5.3%
Intra-run imprecision Mean 3.4 ng/mL %CV 0 to 1.3%
Mean 25 ng/mL %CV 0 to 1.6%
Mean 160 ng/mL %CV 0 to 1.0%
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A high concentration spiked serum pool and a low concentration natural serum pool
were mixed in varying amounts to evaluate the linearity of the assay in its full
measurement range. The analysis and study protocol utilized CLSI evaluation
protocol EP6-A. Nine samples were generated by mixing a pool supplemented with a
high CEA concentration and a pool with low CEA concentration. Each dilution was
tested in 4 assay runs with 2 lots of assay kit. The mean CEA concentration in ng/mL
and %CV of replicates across runs were calculated. The sample %CV was compared
with the expected %CV from the precision analysis. If the observed %CV was less
than the upper 95% confidence limit of the expected %CV, the results were included
for polynomial regression analysis. For acceptance criteria, the criteria resemble the
CLSI acceptance criteria. In these acceptance criteria, parameter estimates of the
second and third order polynomial regression are not significant and the linearity is
indicated for the first order parameter estimates. If these conditions are present then
the assay is deemed linear.
In the sponsor’s description, there was deviation from linearity (parameter
coefficients were different from 0) for both lots studied but the deviation was
acceptable since the difference in linear and polynomial models is the same
magnitude as assay variability. The sponsor shows 2 graphs. The sponsor asserts that
the assay is linear from 0.500 to 200.00 ng/mL.
A graphical representation is as follows:

Three samples with very high CEA values were diluted with kit diluent to yield CEA
concentrations across the assay measurement range. Each sample was diluted 8 times.
Dilutions were tested in triplicate with 2 kit lots and 1 diluent lot. The mean CEA
concentration at each dilution and the %CV of replicates at each dilution were
calculated. Using CLSI protocol EP6-A, the coefficient estimates for the first, second,
and third order polynomials were calculated to determine if the models for the second
and third order polynomials had statistically significant coefficients. If the
coefficients are not significant, the first order linear model is deemed linear on
dilution.
The linearity demonstrates linearity on dilution with the assay diluent in the assay
measurement range. The graphs of the three samples are as follows:

Hook effect
Four specimens (3 with very high CEA values and one specimen spiked with a very
high CEA concentration) were assessed after dilution over a large measurement
range. At least one dilution was within the CEA assay range. Dilution was made
using CEA negative serum. A hook effect would be apparent in a graphic
representation of relative fluorescence units with increasing CEA concentration when
the fluorescence signals decreases after reaching a maximum CEA concentration.

The RFV (relative fluorescence value) signals do not decrease at high CEA
concentrations and is indicative of the lack of a hook effect. The graph does indicate a
flattening of fluorescence signals above 1000 ng/mL but no decrease in signal up to
approximately 100,000 ng/mL. While no formal analysis is performed the graph is
supportive of the lack of a hook effect.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Assay calibrators are traceable to reference standards established at the sponsor and to
Carcinoembryonic Antigen 1st International Reference Preparation provided by the
National Institute of Biological Standards and Controls (code 73/601).
d. Detection limit:
Limits of blank, detection, and quantitation were determined using 2 kit lots on 2
instruments (one per lot) using CLSI protocol EP17-A. Seven low CEA samples were
tested using two lots on two VIDAS instruments. Tested CEA values ranged from
approximately 0.05 to 0.3 ng/mL. Samples ranging from 0.2 to 0.3 ng/mL were used
to estimate the limit of detection while 3 samples of lower CEA value (0.05 to 0.08
ng/mL) were used to estimate the limit of quantitation. Acceptance criteria for the
limit of blank, detection, and quantitation were described as follows:
• Limit of blank – highest measurement result which has a 95% probability to
be observed for a blank sample. It is the 95th percentile of a blank distribution
• Limit of detection – lowest amount of analyte that can be detected with 95%
probability, though not quantified at an exact value.
• Limit of quantitation – lowest actual amount of analyte that can be reliably
detected and at which total error meets lab requirements for accuracy. Total
error specification ± 100% for doses < 0.5 ng/mL.
The results are noted to support a claim for a limit of detection and limit of
quantitation of < 0.5 ng/mL. Therefore, the lowest value for the range of the assay is
0.5 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Hemoglobin, triglyceride, bilirubin, human albumin, rheumatoid factor, HAMA, and
27 drug interferents were evaluated for interference when added to a human serum
pool containing measured amounts of CEA.
Three samples, one CEA negative and two positive CEA (spiked into a negative
sample) were prepared and split into 2 aliquots. One aliquot was spiked with
hemoglobin, triglyceride, or bilirubin and the other with a corresponding volume of
buffer. Five intermediate CEA concentrations, derived from the highest and lowest
CEA concentrations, were prepared by mixing varying amounts of the two aliquots.
Hemoglobin concentrations ranged from 0 to 305 umol/L. Triglyceride concentrations
ranged from 0 to 30 g/L. Bilirubin concentrations ranged from 0 to 510 umol/L.
Aliquots of each concentration were tested in single replicates in 2 runs. The linear
regression coefficients were calculated for the mean CEA concentration at each
interfering substance concentration. The hypothesis that the slope of the best fit line
was zero was tested. If the slope is not equivalent with 0 with a probability < 0.05
7

--- Page 8 ---
then there is interference in the assay from the tested substance and testing must be
repeated with lower concentrations of interfering substance. As acceptance criteria,
there must be no effect from hemoglobin for concentrations less than 300 umol/L, no
effect from triglycerides for concentrations less than 30 g/L, and no effect from
bilirubin at concentrations less than 510 umol/L.
For hemoglobin concentrations ranging from 0 to 305 umol/L, three different CEA
concentrations were within the CEA specification range in the presence and absence
of hemoglobin. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the slope of the best fit line of
CEA concentration and hemoglobin concentration all included zero in the confidence
interval (-0.0001 to 0.0023 for CEA value 3 ng/mL; -0.0097 to 0.0124 for CEA value
44.8 ng/mL; -0.0626 to 0.0756 for CEA concentration 135.4 ng/mL).
For triglyceride concentrations ranging from 0 to 30 g/L, three different CEA
concentrations were within the CEA specification range in the presence and absence
of triglyceride. Additionally, the 95% CIs of the slope of the best fit line of CEA
concentration and triglyceride concentration all included zero in the confidence
interval (-0.0083 to 0.0069 for CEA value 3 ng/mL; -0.0645 to 0.0205 for CEA value
26.1 ng/mL; -0.422 to 0.140 for CEA concentration 74.4 ng/mL).
For bilirubin concentrations ranging from <2 to 595 umol/L, three different CEA
concentrations were within the CEA specification range in the presence and absence
of bilirubin. Additionally, the 95% CIs of the slope of the best fit line of CEA
concentration and bilirubin concentration all included zero in the confidence interval
(-0.0002 to 0.0006 for CEA value 3.6 ng/mL; -0.0038 to 0.0025 for CEA value 28.8
ng/mL; -0.0254 to 0.0115 for CEA concentration 94.4 ng/mL).
Interference with human albumin, rheumatoid factor, and human anti-mouse
antibodies (HAMA) was evaluated at a separate site during clinical study testing for
precision. A modified variation of CLSI document EP7-A2 was used. The 3
interferents were added to a human serum pool containing known CEA concentration
(24.6 ng/mL ± 3.3 ng/mL; range 21.3 to 27.9). The acceptance criterion was no
interference if the test sample %recovery was within the range 85% to 115% (i.e. ±
15% of 100% recovery). No interference was seen with human albumin or HAMA up
to 150 g/L albumin and up to 912 IU/mL HAMA. Decreased CEA recovery (55%)
was seen in the presence of rheumatoid factor at 2400 IU/mL. The sponsor states that
the RF concentration exceeds any value expected in usual serum samples. The
limitations section of the labeling will reflect this interference.
Interference with various chemotherapeutic drugs was evaluated at a separate site
during clinical study testing for precision. A modified variation of CLSI document
EP7-A2 was used. Twenty-seven drug interferents were added to a human serum pool
containing a known CEA concentration (24.6 ng/mL ± 3.3 ng/mL; range 21.3 to 27.9)
and tested in three assay runs. The drugs tested represent drugs typically used in
treatment and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. The following drugs were tested:
8

--- Page 9 ---
Tested interfering drugs
5-fluorouracil Acetaminophen
N-acetyl-L-cysteine Acetylsalycilic acid
Ampicillin Ascorbic acid
Bleomycin Carboplatin
Cefoxitin Cisplatin
Cyclophosphamide Cyclosporine
Dactinomycin Doxocycline
Doxorubicin Etoposide
Ibuprofen Levodopa
Methotrexate Metronidazole
Mitomycin C Naprosyn
Paclitaxel Phenylbutazone
Rifampicin Vinblastine
Vincristine
The acceptance criterion is a ratio of test sample to control between 0.9 and 1.10.
The sponsor notes that rifampicin tested at 2 concentrations had significant
interference (ratio of 0.03 at 1 mg/mL and 0.04 at 0.766 mg/mL). No significant
interference was noted for other tested drugs. All %recoveries were between 0.9 and
1.1 with the exception of N-acetyl-L-cysteine at 2 ng/mL and acetylsalicyclic acid at
1 mg/mL (%recoveries ranged from 0.85 to 1.15). For rifampicin, a statement is
included in the Limitations section of the labeling. The recovery for N-acetyl-L-
cysteine at 2 ng/mL and acetylsalicyclic acid at 1 mg/mL will be claimed at 85% -
115% recovery.
Cross-reactivity with beta-HCG, CA125, CA27.29, CA19-9, AFT, Prostate-specific
antigen (PSA), and Prostatic Acid Phosphatase (PAP) was assessed using samples
serving as calibrators in respective TOSOH assays at its designated concentration. A
human serum-based diluent served as a blank. The samples and concentrations tested
are:
• Beta-HCG - 206 mIU/mL
• CA125 - 100 U/mL
• CA27.29 - 21.6 U/mL
• CA19-9 - 423 U/mL
• AFP - 201 ng/mL
• PSA - 52 ng/mL
• PAP - 19.3 ng/mL
All samples gave CEA values less than 2 ng/mL, the acceptance criterion for this
analysis.
f. Assay cut-off:
The sponsor defines a 12.2% percentage change in CEA values as significant. The
significant change is 2.5 times the total imprecision of the CEA assay across sites,
lots, and concentration (expressed as %CV = 4.8%). The sponsor chose this value to
ensure that the change in CEA value is not attributed to assay variation.
2. Comparison studies:
9

--- Page 10 ---
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Using 1307 samples representing paired values between 0.5 and 100 ng/mL were
tested with the proposed and predicate assays. Deming regression analysis of
comparison gave a slope of 0.941 (95% CI 0.824 to 1.058) and an intercept of -1.291
(95% CI -1.681 to -0.90). The slope was not significantly different from 1.0 (95% CI
of slope includes 1.0) indicating the lack of proportional bias in assay result between
the proposed and predicate assay. The intercept is significantly different from 0 (95%
CI does not include 0) indicating the presence of constant bias between the two
assays.
Using 311 samples collected from colon cancer subjects undergoing serial
surveillance monitoring for disease progression, Deming regression analysis yielded a
slope of the best fit line of 0.82 (95% CI 0.527 to 1.107) and an intercept of 13.3
(95% CI 0.27 to 26.31). This analysis indicates the presence of constant bias of 13.3
ng/mL in serial surveillance monitoring samples when using the proposed assay
compared with the predicate assay. Proportional bias is not present in this
comparison.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable since only serum specimens are utilized.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
b. Clinical specificity:
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Samples utilized in this study were obtained from retrospective sample banks at M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center. Specimens for the study were from subjects with colorectal
cancer. Serial sets must include a minimum of 3 draws (4 draws or more desired) per
subject. Samples were blood draws performed at or after diagnosis throughout as
much of the clinical course as possible. Clinical information detailing the disease
status for each sample and information on types of therapy, if any, received with dates
of administration was collected. Three hundred and two specimens from 79 subjects
were collected. There were 223 evaluable observation pairs. The mean number of
serial specimens per subject was 3.8 (median 2.0). Of the serial samples from 79
subjects, 43% of subjects had 3 visits, 36% had 4 visits, 18% had 5 visits, and 4% had
6 visits. The mean age at diagnosis was 61 years. Eighty-one percent of subjects were
Caucasian, 5% Asian, 7% Hispanic, and 7% African-American. Approximately 75%
are stage III and IV subjects. Stage 0, I, and II represent the remaining percentage.
The National Cancer Institute’s fact sheet for colorectal cancer
(http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/colorect.html) notes the following information:
The stage distribution based on historic stage shows that 40% of colon and rectum
cancer cases are diagnosed while the cancer is still confined to the primary site
(localized stage); 36% are diagnosed after the cancer has spread to regional lymph
nodes or directly beyond the primary site; 19% are diagnosed after the cancer has
already metastasized (distant stage) and for the remaining 5% the staging
information was unknown. The corresponding 5-year relative survival rates were:
89.7% for localized; 68.4% for regional; 10.8% for distant; and 36.6% for unstaged.
10

--- Page 11 ---
Localized stage as described in this way is stage I and II. Regional stage corresponds
to stage III, and distant stage corresponds to stage IV. Therefore the stage distribution
for stage III and IV would be 55%. The fact that the sponsor’s study utilized 70%
subjects as stage III and IV indicates a significant over-sampling of these subjects in
the study.
The outcome of interest was defined as progression of disease from time point i
(clinical visit i, i=1 to n-1) to a succeeding time point j (clinical visit j, j=i+1 to n).
The number of clinical visits for which samples and data are available is defined as n.
The visit number made by a study subject is at the time of diagnosis or after diagnosis
and prior to death, loss to follow-up or remission of disease. The sponsor statistically
defines w as a variable representing disease progression and has 2 values as follows:
ij
1 if there is disease progression from visit i to visit j
0 if no progression (stable disease, response to therapy) from visit i to visit j
Disease progression is determined by the subject’s physician and is based on any or a
composite of physical signs/symptoms, results of lab tests for colorectal cancer,
radiographic findings (CAT scans, PET scans, MRI, x-ray, or ultrasound), or patient
reported symptoms.
The sponsor defines the variable v as 1 if the difference in value of the test assay at
ij
visit i (x) and value of the test assay at a later visit j (x) is greater than or equal to
i j
12.2% (i.e. v = 1 if (x – x) ≥ 12.2%). The variable v is 0 if the difference is
ij j i ij
otherwise (i.e. v = 0 if (x – x) < 12.2%). The sponsor chose this value to ensure that
ij j i
the change in CEA value is not attributed to assay variation and is statistically
significant. In the same way, the percentage change in the predicate device was
defined as 2.5 times the %CV of total imprecision as stated in the predicate package
insert. This value was 2.5 x 4% = 10% change.
To determine an association between the variables w (disease progression) and v
(change in CEA value) a 2 x 2 contingency table can be constructed to find an
association between variables. Items in each of the 4 cells represent pairs of v and w
(1 and/or 0) for visits for all subjects (or for subjects only). The total concordance
from the 2 x 2 contingency table (equivalent with total agreement), positive
concordance, and negative concordance can be calculated. In each situation, it is
assumed that agreement is with physician determined disease progression or no
progression. No specification for concordance values was present. A similar
definition and association will be sought for the predicate device for comparison
purposes.
The table and calculation of concordance values for the association of the proposed
test with disease state across all patient visits for all subjects is the following:

The probability of no association between disease status and change in VIDAS CEA
(≥ 12.2%) was less than 0.0001. The difference in positive concordance (0.672) and 1
minus the negative concordance (1-0.660) was 0.332 (95% CI of difference 0.196 to
0.469). The test is informative on a per visit basis.
Comparison of the concordance values for the proposed and predicate assays was
available from analysis of the line listings for monitored colorectal cancer subjects.

Note from the graph that the linear correlation between %CEA change is modestly

significantly different from 0. Among progressing subjects, the slope of the best fit
line is 1.22 (95% CI 1.160 to 1.281), a value different from 1.0. The intercept of the
line for progressing subjects was 0.094 (95% CI -0.115 to 0.304), a value not
different from 0. The 95% CIs of the regression line on the graph is the interval for
the progressing subjects. This indicates that the slopes of the best fit line for non-
progressing and progressing subjects are equivalent up to approximately 100%
change, despite the difference in the slopes from 1.0. This fact suggests similar,
possibly equivalent, slopes and equivalent %CEA changes in both assays.
ROC analysis was performed of the proposed test with disease state classifications for
all subjects with any progression/no progression and any change in CEA value (223
events in 80 subjects). There is no cutoff value for %change in CEA that is published
or clinically accepted as a reasonable choice. Therefore, clinicians can choose a cutoff
value that they believe is acceptable for the clinical situation of the patient they are
managing. The following table summarizes various sensitivity values and the
resulting specificities and cutoff values at a chosen sensitivity value for the proposed
device:
VIDAS
lower 95% upper 95%
CI of CI of
cutoff Sensitivity specificity specificity specificity
-48.9% 90.6% 11.3% 6.8% 17.3%

47.0% 53.1% 86.8% 80.5% 91.6%
184.2% 25.0% 95.6% 91.1% 98.2%
Note from the table that at high sensitivity there is low specificity (~12%) and the
cutoff %change value is negative. At a cutoff value of 12.3%, very near the sponsor
choice of cutoff, the specificity of the proposed assay is 66%. At this specificity for
the predicate assay, the sensitivity is equivalent (66.7%) with the proposed assay but
the cutoff value for %change in CEA is different, -0.8% or essentially 0%.
4. Clinical cut-off:
The sponsor defines a 12.2% percentage change in CEA values as significant. The
significant change is 2.5 times the total imprecision of the CEA assay across sites, lots,
and concentration (expressed as %CV = 4.8%). The sponsor chose this value to ensure
that the change in CEA value is not attributed to assay variation.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Estimation and empirical distributions of CEA values in various populations of subjects
was performed. A normal healthy population of subjects was recruited for assessment of
CEA values. Approximately 150 each of male and female subjects aged 18-80 years of
age who were apparently healthy (by self report) and were not sick on the day of serum
sampling were tested using the proposed assay. Additionally approximately 75
current/recent male and female smokers were recruited and tested in the proposed assay.
Cumulative distributions and order statistics were calculated in normal healthy

individuals. Confidence intervals for the 5th, 90th, and 95th order statistic were
constructed. The results for these normal healthy subjects for the 5th and 95th percentiles
are as follows:
Population Percentile CEA Lower 95% Upper 95%

Female non- 5th 0.50 0.50 0.50

Male smokers 5th 0.50 0.50 0.53
95th 5.10 3.63 6.44
The empirical distribution of CEA in normal healthy individuals is fundamentally
different and the labeling should reflect the differences.
The following benign disease cohort of 423 subjects was collected for analysis of the
CEA distribution:
Benign urogenital disease 54
Benign diseases of gastrointestinal tract and lung 110
Diabetes 106
Heart disease/hypertension/liver disease 108
Benign breast disease 45
Subjects were males and females 18-80 years of age who had no history of malignancy
(other than non-invasive skin cancer) diagnosed with the above benign diseases. ANOVA
analysis was performed on the CEA values and also included factors for disease group (5
levels), smoking status (3 levels) and age category (< 56 years and > 56 years). Analysis
indicated a significant smoking and age effect. Empirical distributions and 95%
confidence intervals of the 5th, 90th, and 95th percentiles was developed and is
summarized as follows (90th percentile value not shown):

The following malignant disease cohort of 514 subjects was collected for analysis of the
CEA distribution:
Lung/liver cancer 102
Gall bladder/biliary/gastric/pancreatic cancer 59
Prostate/testicular/bladder cancer 147
Colorectal cancer 151
Breast cancer 55
Banked serum samples from the above subjects who were 18-80 years of age, had a no
history of other malignancy (except non-invasive skin cancer), and diagnosed with only
one of the above cancers were selected and analyzed for CEA values. ANOVA analysis
was performed on the CEA values and also included factors for disease group (5 levels),
smoking status (4 levels) and age at diagnosis. The results indicated no differences in
CEA level. Empirical distributions and 95% confidence intervals of the 5th, 90th, and 95th
percentiles was developed and is summarized as follows (90th percentile value not
shown):
Population Percentile CEA Estimate Lower 95% Upper 95%
