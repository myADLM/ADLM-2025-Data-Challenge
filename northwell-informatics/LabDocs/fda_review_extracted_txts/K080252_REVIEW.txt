MammaPrint® result is indicated for use by physicians as a prognostic marker only,
along with other clinicopathological factors.

Same as intended use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
MammaPrint® is not intended for diagnosis, or to predict or detect response to therapy,
or to help select the optimal therapy for patients.
4. Special instrument requirements:

Note: The scanner and bioanalyzer are components of this assay and are cleared only for
this assay and not for any other application. In addition, clearance is only limited to the
bioanalyzer and scanners with the serial numbers as specified above.
I. Device Description:
The MammaPrint® test is performed and provided as a service by Agendia Laboratory. The
test is a microarray based gene expression analysis of RNA extracted from breast tumor
tissue. The test is a custom-designed array chip manufactured by Agilent Technologies using
the Agilent oligonucleotide microarray platform which assesses the mRNA expression of the
70 genes in triplicate. The MammaPrint® microarray features eight 1900-feature subarrays
per glass slide which can each be individually hybridized. Per subarray 232 reporter genes
are printed in triplicate, including the 70 genes which make up the MammaPrint® prognostic
profile. Each subarray additionally includes 465 normalization genes and 289 spots for
hybridization and printing quality control.
The analysis is based on several processes: isolation of RNA from fresh tumor tissue
sections, DNAse treatment of isolated RNA, linear amplification and labeling of DNAse
treated RNA, cRNA purification, hybridization of the cRNA to the MammaPrint®
microaray, scanning the MammaPrint® microarray and data acquisition (feature extraction),
calculation and determination of the risk of recurrence in breast cancer patients.
The MammaPrint® analysis is designed to determine the gene activity of specific genes in a
tissue sample compared to a reference standard. The result is an expression profile, or
fingerprint, of the sample. The correlation of the sample expression profile to a template (the
mean expression profile of 44 tumors with a known good clinical outcome) is calculated and
the molecular profile of the sample is determined (Low Risk, High Risk, Low Risk
Borderline, High Risk Borderline).
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Agendia BV’s MammaPrint®
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
k070675
3. Comparison with predicate:
The device is the same as the predicate, except for the addition of a microarray scanner
and replacement of the low density (LD) microarray with high density (HD) microarray.
Similar to the LD microarray, the HD microarray is manufactured under QSR design
control. The differences between the HD and the LD microarrays are:
• HD array has more concentrated spots on the array and the 70 signature genes are
printed in nine-fold instead of three-fold
• Feature extraction software uses Version 9.5, which uses the triplicate printings
of the 465 normalization genes, rather than single print of 465 normalization
genes in Version 8.5
• X-Print analysis software calculates average of LogRatios of probes printed in
nine-fold instead of three-fold for the LD array.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None

L. Test Principle:
The MammaPrint® service is a microarray based gene expression analysis of a tumor. Refer
to k062694 for detailed description.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i. Reproducibility of high density microrray:
The experimental design consisted of repeated runs over 20 days in which 3
samples with different outcome levels, high, low and borderline, were performed
on MammaPrint index High Density 8-pack arrays. For each day, one run is
performed. For each run, each sample level was assayed in duplicate.
Additionally both control samples high and low risk control (HRC, LRC) as used
for MammaPrint were also run along with one of the replicate Runs. The
repeatability and precision of the MammaPrint index of all outcome levels were at
least as good as the performance of the predicate device (Standard Deviation and
Variance of 0.030 and 0.001 respectively).

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
i. Comparison between the HD and LD microarrays
Ninety-eight (98) samples were selected for MammaPrint service from the period
2004 through 2007. Samples originating from 2004 through 2005 were relabeled
and hybridized to both LD and HD 8-pack arrays. However, for samples from
2006 to 2007, the labeled cRNAs were only re-hybridized on HD 8-pack
MammaPrint arrays and the original MammaPrint Index from previous LD
hybridizations were used. Comparison results showed a 98.9% concordance in
MammaPrint outcome between HD and LD microarray which falls within the
97.7% technical precision of the predicate device.

ii. Comparison between the previously cleared scanner and the additional scanner
The same samples from the precision study were used to evaluate the performance
between the scanners. A set of 26 newly hybridized slides (104 samples) were
scanned first on the FDA cleared scanner (serial nr: US22502555, Agendia DPd
Id: 002) and subsequently on the new scanner (serial nr: US45103019 Agendia
DPd Id: 112). MammaPrint indices were compared between both scans using
Passing and Bablok regression analysis and a comparison of the variance per
scanner. The difference between the mean, median and standard deviation for all
