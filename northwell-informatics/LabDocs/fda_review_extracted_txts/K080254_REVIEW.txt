510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
K080254
B. Purpose for Submission:
Marketing product in the U.S.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Aperio Technologies, Inc.
ScanScope® XT System, IHC PR Breast Tissue Manual Read of Digital Slides
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Manual interpretation of digital images for immunohistochemistry Progesterone
Receptor (PR) stained slides
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The ScanScope® XT System is an automated digital slide creation, management,
viewing and analysis system which consists of an automated digital microscope
slide scanner, computer, color monitor, keyboard and digital pathology
information management software and image analysis software. For this
particular application slides are scanned and a digital image is generated that the
pathologist may use for semi-quantitative assessment of PR
immunohistochemistry stained histological specimens. This assessment may be
performed without use of the image analysis software and the system software
makes no independent interpretations of the data.
2. Principles of Operation:
The ScanScope® XT System is intended to provide digital images to the
pathologist to supplement the quantitative interpretation of PR
immunohistochemistry stained breast cancer specimens. Formalin-fixed, paraffin
embedded breast cancer specimens are stained with the Dako Monoclonal Mouse
Anti-Human Progesterone Receptor (Clone PgP636) and Ventana CONFIRM™
anti-Progesterone Receptor (Clone 16) according to the package inserts. Slides are
then scanned and digitized at high resolution using the ScanScope XT digital slide
1

--- Page 2 ---
scanner. The pathologist manually reads and interprets the digital image without
use of image analysis software. The slide is then interpreted for progesterone
receptor status using the percent positivity of tumor nuclei and/or staining
intensity according to the laboratory’s established interpretation criteria.
3. Modes of Operation:
Computer-assisted interpretation
4. Specimen Identification:
Specimens are identified by slide label (a digital image is taken of the slide label
and stored with the digital slide) or by barcode, if provided by the user’s
laboratory information system.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Immunohistochemical stained microslides can be loaded in the ScanScope XT
manually (one at a time) or automatically. The ScanScope XT can automatically
scan 120 slides contained in slide racks.
6. Calibration:
Calibration of the ScanScope XT is an automated process which is re-verified as
part of the scanning process for every scanned slide. If the calibration is not
within predefined limits, then the user is prevented from scanning the slide and
must take steps to assure that the scan is within acceptable limits.
When the user scans a slide, the controller software automatically performs a
“prescan”. The prescan is a scan of a small region of the slide which contains
clear glass or “white space”. The brightness and color characteristics of the image
are used to correct the resulting scanned image. The main functions of the
prescan process are to automatically verify that no significant tissue is present,
flatten the illumination field, correct the white balance, and measure bulb
brightness.
7. Quality Control:
The accuracy of the system depends on the laboratory following the quality
control instructions recommended in the labeling of the IHC PR test kits.

J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
The substantial equivalence study was based on comparison of manual reads of the
digital slide to conventional manual microscopy. Specimen for the study were
immunohistochemically stained at the clinical sites using Dako in vitro diagnostic (IVD)
FDA cleared Monoclonal Mouse Anti-Human Progesterone Receptor (Clone PgR 636)
(K020023). All manual scoring was performed in accordance with the reagent vendor’s
instructions for use.
Two Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) qualified clinical sites
participated in the study. Prior to their participation in the study each clinical site
obtained exemption status from an Institutional Review Board (IRB).
A total set of 180 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast tissue specimens from both
clinical sites were used for the study; 80 slides from the first clinical site and 100 slides
from the second clinical site.
The specimens at the first clinical site were selected based on their clinical scores on file
to provide an equal distribution of PR slides in the percentage of positive nuclei ranges
0%, 1% to 4%, 5% to 9%, 10% to 49%, and 50% to 100%. The specimens at the second
clinical site were routine specimens taken from their clinical operation, representing the
true target population of cases in a typical clinical setting.
The study was performed primarily at the participating clinical sites and all parts except
the scanning of glass slides were performed at their facilities using their typical
workflow. The glass slides were prepared in the sites’ clinical laboratories and read by
board certified staff pathologists. For the scanning of glass slides ScanScope XT
instruments were operated in a simulated clinical setting at Aperio (designed to be
representative of a typical lab environment).
All ScanScope XT instruments used in the study were production units and were
delivered, installed, and maintained in accordance with the approved procedures, per
Aperio’s QSPs (Quality Systems Procedures), and as described in product documentation
and labeling.
At each site, three pathologists performed a blinded read of the glass slides using a
microscope and reported the percentage of positive nuclei [0%, 1%, … 100%] and
5

--- Page 6 ---
overall average intensity score [0, 1+, 2+, or 3+] for each of the slides. The glass slides
were scanned at Aperio using a different ScanScope for each site, and after a wash-out
period of over one week and randomization of the slides, the same three pathologists
remotely viewed and performed a blinded read of the digital slides on a computer monitor
and reported the percentage of positive nuclei and overall average intensity score for each

PR Average Intensity Score Distributions.
As it can be seen from the ER and PR percentage of positive nuclei distributions, it was
not possible to obtain an equal distribution of the percentage of positive nuclei in the
range from 1% to 10%. This difficulty was founded in the limited representation of this
percentage range in the true target population of cases.
All glass slides were scanned using a different ScanScope XT instrument for each clinical
site.
The statistical analyses are presented across all slides for each of the methods: manual
microscopy and reading digital slides on a computer monitor, and comparatively between
methods for manual microscopy against reading digital slides on a computer monitor.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
This precision study was not done on the manual read of the digital slides, but using
Aperio’s IHC PR image analysis algorithm. The image analysis algorithm detects and
quantifies the same cell features and uses the same scoring scheme as the pathologists
reading IHC PR slides and was used to quantify objectively the variability of the digital
slides provided by the ScanScope systems. The intensity scores are derived by the
algorithm from a range of threshold values per category as delineated in the table below.
Intensity values are values from 0 to 255 where 0 indicates no intensity and 255 indicates
the maximum intensity. The intensity values were used only for the precision studies and
are not for clinical use.
Intensity Score Algorithm Threshold Ranges
0 255 - 210
1+ 209-186
2+ 185 – 156
3+ 155 - 0
10 PR slides with two slides in each of the percentage of positive nuclei ranges: 0%, 1%
to 4%, 5% to 9%, 10% to 50%, and 51% to 100% were sampled from site 1 to be used in
a suite of precision studies. The slides were sample in sequential order using the rounded
average score of the manual microscopy scores provided by the three pathologists.
Separate studies were conducted to analyze the system introduced variability separately
from the variability introduced by the pathologists. Pathologist precision studies were
only performed to be able to put the system variability into perspective.
System precision studies used the same tumor regions for analysis over all runs to
eliminate the influence by the pathologists. Pathologist precision studies used the same
digital slides to eliminate the influence of the system.
Aperio’s image analysis algorithm is capable of calculating percentages of positive nuclei
smaller than 1% in which case the algorithm also calculates the average intensity of those
nuclei. As a percentage of positive nuclei smaller than 1% is considered to be completely
negative, the intensity scores were corrected to be 0 and intensity values to be N/A for all
cases where the percentage of positive nuclei was smaller than 1%.
If using the intensity score alone to determine PR status, the user should be aware that
percentages of positive nuclei smaller than 1% may affect test results.
Intra-System: The slide scores provided by image analysis over 10 consecutive scans
were analyzed for all 10 PR slides.
Percentage of Positive Nuclei
The image analysis results show an overall standard deviation of 0.54% (maximum
1.47%) and average range (maximum – minimum) of 1.06% (maximum 4.78%) for

Inter-system: The slide scores provided by image analysis over 10 consecutive scans on
three different ScanScope XT instruments were analyzed for all 10 PR slides.
Percentage of Positive Nuclei
The image analysis results on each of the three ScanScope systems show an
overall average standard deviation of 0.54%, 0.53% and 0.75% (maximum 1.47%,
1.23%, 2.05%) and average range of 1.06%, 1.23%, and 1.50% (maximum
4.78%, 4.17%, 7.20%) for the percentage of positive nuclei [0.0-100.0%] across
all runs.
The image analysis results of the three ScanScope systems combined show an
overall average standard deviation of 0.87% (maximum 1.57%) and average range
of 2.54% (maximum 8.13%) for the percentage of positive nuclei [0.0-100.0%]
across all runs.
