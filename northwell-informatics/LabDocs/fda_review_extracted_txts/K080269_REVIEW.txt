K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle:
The Triage® Profiler S.O.B. Panel is a fluorescence immunoassay for the quantitative
determination of D-dimer, CK-MB, myoglobin, troponin I, and BNP in whole blood
and plasma specimens using EDTA as the anticoagulant. After addition of the sample
to the sample port, the cells are separated from the plasma via a filter contained in the
device. A predetermined quantity of plasma is allowed to react with fluorescent
antibody conjugates within the reaction chamber. After sufficient incubation has
occurred, the reaction mixture flows down the device detection lane. Complexes of
the analytes and fluorescent antibody conjugates are captured on discrete zones
resulting in binding assays that are specific for each analyte. The concentration of the
analyte in the specimen is directly proportional to the fluorescence detected.

The changes to the portion of the Indications for Use pertaining to BNP and

section of the labeling were cleared for the Triage® BNP Test in k051787.
To support the additional intended use, the sponsor provided five peer-
reviewed articles from the scientific literature assessing the clinical utility of
BNP measurements as an aid in the risk stratification of patients with heart
failure. All five studies utilized the Biosite Triage BNP device in their test
method.
In one additional paper titled “How well does B-type natriuretic peptide
predict death and cardiac events in patients with heart failure: systematic
review,” J.A. Doust et al. (British Medical Journal, volume 330, 19 March
2005) performed a systematic evidence-based medicine review of the
literature. The review included 24 studies in all. While the review included
studies with different study designs and test methods (BNP and NT-proBNP),
the five articles previously mentioned were part of the review. The authors
concluded that BNP was a strong prognostic indicator for patients with heart
failure.
All literature references are cited in the sponsor’s labeling.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Previously demonstrated for Triage® Profiler S.O.B. Panel in k042723 and
Triage® CardioProfilER® Panel in k030286.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Previously demonstrated for Triage® Profiler S.O.B. Panel in k042723 and
Triage® CardioProfilER® Panel in k030286.
