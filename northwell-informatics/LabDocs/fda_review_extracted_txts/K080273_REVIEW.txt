b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
Control values are traceable to an in-house standard prepared from NIST
material SRM917b. The control material is analyzed on the sponsor’s
reference analyzer in one run of 10 replicates and values must fall within ±
5% of the target value of the standard.
Expected Values (Control Range Determination)
The expected values were determined by repeat testing on Bayer Ascensia
Breeze 2 using three lot numbers of test strips. Statistical analysis of the data
obtained resulted in one range for the three lots. The expected results may
change with each new lot, but the control range is listed in the product insert.
In addition, the product insert alerts the user to use the control range indicated
in the control’s product insert rather than the glucose test strip product’s
insert.
Stability
• Shelf Life: Real time stability studies were conducted. Protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
• Open Vial Stability: Control material was divided into two pools—
Test and Control. The Control Group remained unopened until testing
against the Test Group. The Test Group was opened daily and allowed
to stand at room temperature for 10 minutes, then closed and stored at
room temperature. One vial of the Test Group and one vial of the
Control Group were checked weekly by the sponsor’s reference
method. Results from the study supported a 13 week open vial
stability.
