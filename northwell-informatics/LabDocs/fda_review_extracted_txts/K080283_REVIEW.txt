the reagents contained on the strip’s electrodes. The glucose in the sample is oxidized by the
enzyme glucose oxidase, and the current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured
and converted to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is
proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
For performance of the glucose meter and test strips, see k061181. The performance
from k061181 is provided below:
The sponsor evaluated the precision of the device using replicate measurements of
glucose control solutions and anticoagulated venous whole blood. In order to
determine that the change in sample volume does not affect precision, the sponsor
tested four volume levels (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 µL) of venous whole blood collected
from 10 volunteers. The ten samples were pooled together, depleted of glucose, and
then separated into three groups. Each group was spiked with a dextrose solution to
within the desired concentration range: low 60-92 mg/dL, normal 109-165 mg/dL and
high 259-389 mg/dL. Different testing volumes (0.5uL, 0.6uL, 0.7uL and 0.8 uL) of
each sample were evaluated for repeatability. Since the volume claimed is 0.7 µL,
only the 0.7 µL data is presented below.

verified accuracy of the device over the reportable range (20 – 600 mg/dL) against a
standard detection method (see Method Comparison below).

sponsor has shown traceability of the meter to a laboratory analyzer. The sponsor has
described their strip stability testing protocol and acceptance criteria which were
found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the IDEAL LIFE Gluco-Manager GMM 0001 Blood Glucose
Monitoring System is 20 - 600 mg/dL. This range was verified by the linearity study
(referenced from k041107).
e. Analytical specificity:
The specificity of the device was assessed in k041107. Given that the fundamental
technology has not changed from k041107, the sponsor claims that elevated blood
triglycerides and the following substances do not affect results: acetaminophen,
dopa, methyldopa, L-dopa and tolbutamide occurring in expected blood
concentrations. Due to the change in read time of the glucose oxidase reaction, the
sponsor provided studies of reducing substances along with an altitude study for the
new strips. Reducing substances such as uric acid and ascorbic acid occurring in
expected blood concentrations (0-3 mg/dL and 5-20 mg/dL respectively) were shown
not interfere with glucose measurements. The altitude study also showed that the
percentage of mean difference between strips is within the acceptable range (as
defined by ISO 15197: within ±15 mg/dL when glucose concentration <75mg/dL and
within ±20% when glucose concentration ≥75mg/dL) indicating that the new test
strips are equivalent to the predicate strips at the same altitude (up to 10,744 feet).
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor demonstrated that the GMM 0001 Blood Glucose Monitoring System for
finger stick is equivalent to a standard method (YSI-2300) by having 121 patients for
the standard method compared to finger stick

For performance of the glucose meter and test strips, see also k061181. The
performance from k061181 (with alternate site testing) is provided below:
The sponsor demonstrated that the ACHTUNG TD-4207 Blood Glucose Monitoring
System for finger stick is equivalent to a standard method (YSI-2300) and can be
used on alternate sites (specifically the capillary blood from finger compared to the
palm, forearm, upper arm, calf, and thigh) by having 120 patients for the standard
method compared to finger stick and 100 patients for each alternate site test the
meter. For the finger stick against the standard method, samples ranged as follows:
10% of samples were 20-50 mg/dL, 35% of samples were 51-110 mg/dL, 30% of
samples were 111-150 mg/dL, 10% of samples were 151-250 mg/dL, 10% of samples
were 251-400 mg/dL, and 5% of samples were 401-600 mg/dL. For the AST sites,
the samples ranged as follows: 40% of samples were 51-110 mg/dL, 30% of samples
were 111-150 mg/dL, 20% of samples were 151-250 mg/dL, and 10% of samples
were 251-400 mg/dL. All patients blood glucose levels were in a steady state for
these studies. The studies are summarized below:

The IDEAL LIFE Gluco-Manager GMM 0001 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is
capable of data transmission to a PC or a compatible device validated by the
manufacturer.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:

--- Page 7 ---
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm,
forearm, upper arm, calf, and thigh only. Since the whole blood sample is applied
directly to the test strip there are no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
A code number is provided with each batch of test strips to calibrate the meter for that
batch. The code number must be entered into the meter to match the number found on
the test strip vial. No further calibrations are required of the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor is providing a low, medium, high glucose control solutions with this device.
When a test strip is inserted into the meter, the control mode can be activated. This
prevents control results from being stored in the internal memory. An acceptable range
for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label.
