K. Standard/Guidance Documents Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI Documents:
• User Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices: Approved
Guideline (EP5-A2)
• Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: a Statistical
Approach: Approved Guideline (EP6-A2)
• Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry: Approved Guideline (EP7-A2)
• Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation;
Approved Guideline (EP-17A)
L. Test Principle:
Biotinidase activity is determined by measuring the color that develops from p-
Aminobenzoic Acid (PABA) after PABA is released from Biotinyl-p-Aminobenzoate
(Biotin-PAB). Samples with biotinidase activity develop a purple color. Samples
without biotinidase activity remain straw-colored.
Patient samples of whole blood collected on standardized filter paper are eluted in a
standard 96 well microplate. The plate is incubated with Biotin-PAB in a pH 6 buffer at
37°C for 240 minutes on a combination incubator/shaker. Following incubation,
trichloroacetic acid is added to the sample mixture and the resulting precipitate is
removed through filtration. The PABA in the filtrate is subsequently diazotized and
coupled to a napthol derivative to form an azo dye by the successive addition of sodium
nitrite, acidic ammonium sulfamate and finally, N-1-naphthylethylenediamine
dihydrochloride (NED). The azo dye is measured colorimetrically at 550 nm on a
commercial microplate absorbance reader with a reference measurement at 690 nm.

The color developed is proportional to the biotinidase activity in the sample. A standard
curve prepared from a stock PABA solution is used to evaluate the results.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed using CLSI Document EP5-A2: Evaluation of
Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved
Guideline – Second Edition as a guideline. Samples at 3 concentration levels of
biotinidase activity were analyzed in duplicate on 2 runs per day for 20 non-
consecutive days. The concentration level proximate to the biotinidase deficient
cutoff of 10 MRU was analyzed over 5 non-consecutive days. Within-run and
4

--- Page 5 ---
total precision was calculated according to CLSI EP5-A2. A total of 80 data
points at each level were collected.
Sample blood spot controls used for the study with no activity (deficient) and
partial activity are manufactured from stripped human serum that is mixed with
whole human red blood cells and subsequently heat deactivated before being
spotted on standard filter paper. Normal controls consist of normal human serum
mixed with whole red blood cells that are not heated before spotting. Controls
with partial activity are manufactured by combining deficient and normal controls
before they are spotted. Additionally, dithioerythritol (DTE) is added prior to
spotting to preserve the enzymatic activity.
Units for the Microplate Reagent Kit are microplate response units or MRU. A
MRU equals 1 μmol of p-aminobenzoic acid produced from Biotin-PAB per dL
per 240 minutes of incubation at 37°C.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study was performed using CLSI Document EP6-A: Evaluation of
the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach;
Approved Guideline as a guideline. The claimed measuring range for this device
is 3 - 213 MRU. Two pools of manufactured blood spots, one with high
biotinidase activity and one with low biotinidase activity were extracted and then
proportionately mixed to provide 18 concentrations at equally spaced intervals.
Four replicates at each level were analyzed in a single run to provide data to
determine linearity according to CLSI EP6-A.
The absolute values of the differences between each replicate were calculated for
each level, followed by the mean difference. Next, the sum of the squared
differences and its mean were calculated as well as the sum of the squared
percent differences and its mean. Finally, first, second and third order regressions
of the data were performed to evaluate whether any non-linear terms were
significant. Results were determined according to the method outlined in CLSI
EP6-A.

The results of the t-test for b (x2 term) on the second order regression analysis
2
and for b (x3 term) on the third order regression analysis show that there are no
3
significant nonlinear terms. There are no concentrations at which the percentage
difference between the first and second order regressions exceeds 5%. In the
range of 5 to 213 MRU, the system is judged to be linear.

dried blood spot quality control material with each run to validate results. All
quality control requirements and testing should be performed in conformance
with local, state and/or federal regulations.
Calibrator:
a. Traceability: Users dilute the stock PABA solution provided in the kit to
generate a series of calibrators added to wells of each microplate. The PABA
stock solution is made with commercially available p-aminobenzoic acid free
acid. This solid is weighed on certified balances and dissolved in a solution
containing hydrochloric acid and preservative. There is no current standard
for PABA available.
b. Value assignment: multiple replicates of each new lot of PABA stock solution
as well as replicates of the currently marketed lot and an archived primary lot
are tested with an FDA cleared device for biotinidase screening. New lots of
PABA stock solution must have values ± 2% of the primary lot.
Stability: Astoria-Pacific makes two claims of shelf life on the labeling:
Shelf life for unopened kits is 2 years. Recommended storage for unopened kits
is 2-8°C. Prepared reagents are stable for 14 days. The study protocol,
acceptance criteria and summary of results was reviewed and found to be
acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of the Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of
Quantitation (LoQ) were determined using CLSI Document EP-17A: Protocols
for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved
Guideline as a guideline.
Over the course of 3 non-consecutive days, 5 samples deficient in biotinidase
activity were analyzed in 5 batches of 12 replicates each for a total of 60
observations. Analyzed concurrently were 60 replicates of a blank control
sample. Results were used to determine the detection limit of the analytical
system per CLSI document EP-17A.

The LoD and LoQ for biotinidase activity was calculated as 3 MRU, determined
using the guidelines in CLSI EP17-A. Proportions of false positives (α) are less
than 0.1% and false negatives (β) are less than 0.1%, based on 120
determinations, with 60 blank and 60 low-level samples. The LoB was calculated
as 2 MRU.
e. Analytical specificity:
Study protocols to evaluate the potential interference from various compounds
used CLSI Document EP5-A2: Evaluation of Precision Performance of
Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline – Second Edition as a
guideline. To determine the potential interference from various compounds, the
following procedure was used: six lots of dried blood spots were created for two
blood samples with different levels of partial biotinidase activity (at the lower
side of the partial deficiency range at ~18 MRU and at the higher side of the
range at ~48 MRU) were prepared with either no added compound or two
different concentrations of added compound (see table below for each compound
and added concentration/quantity). Eight replicates at each level were analyzed in
a single run to provide data to determine the effects of the compound on
biotinidase analysis.

prominent warnings.
Lipid: analysis of the data shows that a lipid concentration of 37 mmol/L caused
an apparent decrease in biotinidase activity of approximately 65%. A lipid
concentration of 18.5 mmol/L caused an apparent decrease in biotinidase activity
of approximately 44%. A sample with partial biotinidase activity with very high
lipid levels could potentially be classified as deficient, which would result in
confirmatory testing. Confirmatory testing mitigates the risk of a patient being
misclassified due to interference from high lipid levels.
Sulfamethoxazole: added sulfamethoxazole caused a significant increase in
patient response at both the 1.58 mmol/L and 0.79 mmol/L concentration level.
Sulfonamides react with the color developing reagents to give an intense purple
color. Sulfamethoxazole combined with trimethoprim, sulfisoxazole, and any
sulfonamide with a free or hydrolyzable primary aromatic amino group may
interfere in this fashion. As a consequence, for patients being treated with
sulfonamides, an alternate biotinidase screening method should be employed.
This is a well-known interference and it is prominently included this constraint in
the labeling.
Trimethoprim: analysis shows that at trimethoprim concentrations of 138 μmol/L
there was approximately an 23% decrease in biotinidase response. At
trimethoprim concentrations of 69 μmol/L there was approximately an 8%
decrease in biotinidase response. A patient with low biotinidase activity and with
very high trimethoprim levels could potentially be classified as having partial
activity, which would result in confirmatory testing. Confirmatory testing
mitigates the risk of a patient being misclassified due to interference from high
trimethoprim levels.
The possible interference by phenytoin, ampicillin, gentamicyn sulfate, vitamin
K, penicillin G potassium, kanamycin sulfate, adrenocorticotropic hormone,
valproic acid and sodium phenobarbital were evaluated and found to not interfere
with this test at therapeutic concentrations.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed to determine the correlation
between the predicate device and the SPOTCHECK Biotinidase Microplate
Reagent Kit (proposed device). This study compares the 2 kits if each were used
according to their respective labeling. The cutoffs used for patient classification
are calculated from the mean result of the 564 patient samples as described in
each device’s package insert.
564 patient samples were analyzed using both the Microplate Reagent Kit and
the predicate device. The newborn dried blood spots were primarily from two

states’ departments of health and were of varying age. All cards containing real
patient samples were stored in a freezer when not in use. Included in this study
were the assay results for 2 patients clinically-confirmed to be biotinidase
deficient and 10 deficient controls provided by the Centers for Disease Control
(CDC).
A partial biotinidase activity and profound deficient cutoff were determined on
both devices using 37% and 10% of the mean result of 564 dried blood spots.
While literature suggests that a partial activity classification can be considered
at or below 30% of the mean patient value, the sponsor has opted to recommend
37% as a more conservative cutoff.

*Note: Above table does not include 10 CDC deficient controls or 2 patients
known to be deficient in biotinidase activity.
The cut-offs for the new device with the present study material were calculated
to be 10 MRU (deficient) and 36 MRU (partial activity).
The results of the comparison study show that 11 of 11 samples classified as
deficient by the predicate device were also found to be deficient by the
Microplate Kit. Five samples were classified as having partial biotinidase
activity by the predicate device; of these samples, four were similarly classified
by the Microplate Kit. The single sample that was classified as normal by the
Microplate Kit yielded a value of 9 ERU with the predicate device, right at the
cutoff of 10 ERU.
The Microplate Kit classified 1 sample as having partial biotinidase activity that
the predicate device found to be normal. Similar to the disagreement above, this
sample had a result of 35 MRU, right at the partial activity cutoff of 36 MRU.
It should be noted that both devices classified 1 patient sample clinically-
determined to be deficient as partial, however this sample result fell on the
cutoff of each kit. Most importantly, this patient would have been slated for
confirmatory testing regardless of which kit was employed.

Note: 1 partial* and the 11 deficient represent the 2 clinically-confirmed patients
and 10 CDC deficient controls. Discrepant results** were not confirmed by
follow-up testing.
As noted in the labeling, it is up to each laboratory to determine their own
clinical decision levels based on its regional patient population.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. This device is to be used only with neonatal whole blood.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
A partial biotinidase activity and profound deficient cutoff were determined on both
devices using 37% and 10% of the mean result of 564 dried blood spots. While
literature suggests that a partial activity classification can be considered at or below
30% of the mean patient value, the sponsor has opted to recommend 37% as a more
conservative cutoff.
As specified in the package insert, all samples below the partial activity cutoff
(37%) require confirmation and follow-up testing according to local, state and
federal requirements.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Each laboratory must determine its range of normal, partial and deficient levels of
biotinidase activity, based on its population and analytical variables.
The activity of normal samples varies widely, and the activity of all samples
decreases with time under any conditions of storage.
