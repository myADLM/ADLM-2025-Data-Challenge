H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Refer to Indications for use.
2. Indication(s) for use:
TUBI's UNISCAN-DoA is a system intended for use in Drugs of Abuse
Screening Tests.
The mAMP/Opi/THC panel test is a prescription assay intended for use with
UNISCAN-DoA Scanner in laboratory by professional personnel. The
mAMP/Opi/THC assays were calibrated with d-
methamphetamine/morphine/11-nor-Δ9-THC-9-COOH, respectively. It
provides qualitative screening results for Methamphetamine/ Opiates/
Cannabinoids in human urine at a cutoff concentration of 1000/300/50 ng/mL.
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use.
This assay provides only a preliminary result. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result,
particularly in evaluating a preliminary positive result. To obtain a confirmed
analytical result, a more specific alternate chemical method is needed. Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy (GC/MS) is the recommended
confirmatory method.
3. Special condition for use statement(s):
This assay provides only a preliminary result. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result,
particularly in evaluating a preliminary positive result. To obtain a confirmed
analytical result, a more specific alternate chemical method is needed. Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy (GC/MS) is the recommended confirmatory
method.
The assay is not designated for use in point-of-care settings.
Tests for opiates cannot distinguish between abused drugs and certain
prescribed medications. Certain foods or medications may interfere with tests
for amphetamines and opiates and cause false positive results.
4. Special instrument Requirements:
UNISCAN-DoA Scanner

I. Device Description:
The product is a single-use device in a cassette format. Operators add several drops
of the sample to the sample well. The test reaction is initiated by movement of the
sample through the test strip. At the end of the 25 minute incubation period the user
inserts the cartridge into the reader. The reader performs a color signal analysis on
the reacted test cassette and produces a result of negative, positive, or invalid. Prior
to insertion of the cassette, the operator must enter the correct panel number (which
identifies the test cassette) and the strip calibration curve for the specific lot of test
cassette.
Description of the test antibodies: monoclonal mouse antibody against d-
methamphetamine, morphine, and 11-nor-Δ9-THC-9-COOH
Description of the control line antibody: polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Triage TOX Drug Screen
2. Predicate K number(s):
k043242
3. Comparison with predicate:
Both devices are for the qualitative determination of methamphetamine,
opiates, and THC in urine, and utilize the same cutoff concentrations. Both
are read by an instrument. The reagent formulations vary between the two
devices.

L. Test Principle:
The test employs lateral flow immunochromatographic technology.
Drug in the sample and drug-labeled conjugate (containing a chromagen) compete for
antibody binding sites in the test area of the test strip. Binding of drug in the sample
causes the absence of a line at the test area, i.e., a positive result. When drug is not
present in the sample, the drug-labeled conjugate binds at the test line, resulting in
formation of a line, i.e., a negative result. At the end of the incubation period the user
inserts the cartridge into the reader, which produces a result of negative, positive, or
invalid.
The device also has an internal process control which indicates that an adequate
volume of sample has been added and that the immunochromatographic strip is intact.

c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
Positive and negative external control materials are required but are
not specifically identified in the labeling.
The device has an internal process control. Users are instructed to
follow government regulations when determining when to run
positive and negative external controls.
d. Detection limit:
Sensitivity of this assay is characterized by validating performance
around the claimed cutoff concentration of the assay, including a
determination of the lowest concentration of drug that is capable of
producing a positive result. This information appears in the
precision section, above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking various concentrations of
similarly structured drug compounds into drug-free urine. By
analyzing various concentration of each compound the sponsor
determined the concentration of the drug that produced a response
approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay.
Results of those studies appear in the table(s) below:

The following compounds were evaluated for potential positive and/or
negative interference with the assay. To evaluate for interference the
sponsor prepared control samples that consisted of drug-free urine, drug-
free urine spiked at 50% of the cutoff, and drug-free urine spiked at 150%
of the cutoff:
Analyte Methamphetamine Opiates THC

100 µg/mL of each potentially interfering compound was then added to
aliquots of the control samples described above and analyzed. There were
no deviations from the expected results. None of the compounds exhibited
any negative or positive interference with the assay

There is the possibility that other substances and/or factors not listed
above may interfere with the test and cause false results, e.g.,
interferences, technical, or procedural errors.
To test for potential positive/and or negative interference from
endogenous conditions the sponsor prepared the sponsor prepared control
samples that consisted of drug-free urine, drug-free urine spiked at 50% of
the cutoff, and drug-free urine spiked at 150% of the cutoff and tested the
following compounds and physiological conditions:
2000 mg/dL glucose
5.0 – 8.5 pH
1.004, 1.010, and 1.030 specific gravity
2000 mg/dL albumin
10 mg/dL hemoglobin
4000 mg/dL urea
10 mg/dL uric acid
There were no deviations from the expected results.
f. Assay cut-off:
The identified cutoff concentrations for methamphetamine and THC
are recommended for use by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration (SAMHSA). For opiates, SAMHSA
recommends a cutoff of 2,000 ng/mL while the sponsor has chosen
to use 300 ng/mL.
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the
claimed cutoff concentration appears in the precision section, above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Because the candidate device was compared to a reference method,
GC/MS, it was not compared to a predicate device.
Sample description: Unaltered clinical urine samples were evaluated.
The study included an adequate number of samples that contained
drugs near to the cutoff concentration of the assay. Approximately

10% of the study samples are evenly distributed between plus and
minus 50% of the claimed cutoff concentration.
Number of study sites: one
Type of study site(s): clinical setting

2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
There are no special sampling or handling issues. The sponsor recommends that
specimens be brought to room temperature prior to testing and that samples with
particulate matter be centrifuged before testing.
5. Calibration:
Calibration parameters are provided for each lot of test cartridges. Prior to
testing, the user must enter the test type (referred to as a panel) and the strip
calibration curve data.
6. Quality Control:
Each device has internal process controls which run with every sample. A line
appearing in the control region confirms that sufficient sample volume and that
interpret the test if the control line fails to be detected by the scanner.
Positive and negative external controls are available from commercial sources to
ensure proper system performance. In the labeling, the manufacturer recommends
that the external control values are within established range and if the values of
external control do not fall within established range, the test results are invalid and
the sample needs to be repeated.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10
