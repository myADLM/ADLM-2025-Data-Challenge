I. Device Description:
The submitted device is the same device as the ABL80 FLEX (k051804) with the exception
of the addition of oximetry and the changes to the pump tube, sample inlet, sample volume,
and solution pack. As pH, pO2, pCO2, potassium, sodium, calcium, chloride, and glucose
were already cleared for use in the k051804 submission, the focus of this clearance is on only
the changes to the device (changes to the pump tube, sample inlet, sample volume, solution
pack, and addition of the analytes total hemoglobin, sO2, FO2Hb, FCOHb, FMetHb, and
FHHb).

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
There are three different measuring principles employed.
Potentiometry: A potential is recorded using a voltmeter, which relates to the concentration
of the sample. A reference electrode is used to provide a stable, fixed potential against which
other potential differences can be measured. This measurement technique is used for pH,
pCO2 and electrolytes.
Amperometry: The magnitude of an electrical flow of current is proportional to the
concentration of the substance being oxidized or reduced at an electrode. This measurement
technique is used for pO2 and Glucose.
CO-Oximetry: Measurements involve ultrasonically lysing the whole blood sample and then
utilizing a broad spectrum spectrometer to evaluate the sample at a variety of wavelengths.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Samples were heparinized whole blood from healthy, voluntary donors. The blood
was prepared to obtain multiple concentration levels of each measured parameter.
For sO2 and FCOHb, the blood was mixed with appropriate gas mixture to attain test
levels. For FMetHb and FHHb the blood was chemically treated to attain test levels.
Five replicates per level and analyte were measured on each ABL80 FLEX CO-OX.
The test was repeated for 3 days. A single operator performed each test within each

A precision study was performed to assess the reproducibility of sample measurement in
the ABL80 FLEX CO-OX when samples are performed by end-users at the point-of-care.
The method used for this study was repeat measurements on several levels of aqueous
samples in analysis mode. Aqueous samples consisted of ampoules containing 3
different levels of all parameters. Ampoules were chosen at random and analyzed once.
This study was performed by five different point of care personnel at two different
hospital locations. The site users had no previous experience with the ABL80 FLEX CO-
OX.
Results from each site were tabulated separately. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and
coefficient of variance (%CV) were calculated for each test level and parameter. The
data were not pooled due to small biases between sites. The biases are largely due to the
nature of the test samples. The test samples were aqueous quality control materials
packaged in glass ampoules with an included gas phase. The gas phase produces a
temperature dependency of the gas tensions and pH which, if not equilibrated to the same
temperature at each site, will produce small biases of the gas and pH measurements
between sites due to the temperature differences at the test sites.

MetHb) were against ABL735 analyzers. Samples were heparinized whole blood
from healthy, voluntary donors. The blood was prepared to obtain high, mid, and low
concentration levels of each measured parameter covering the reportable range. For
tHb, the plasma volume of the sample was adjusted to attain test levels. For sO2 and
FCOHb, the blood was mixed with an appropriate gas mixture to attain test levels.
For FMetHb and FHHb the blood was chemically treated to attain test levels using
sodium dithionite in TRIS-buffer for HHb and potassium nitrite in isotonic saline
solution for MetHb. Four replicates per level and parameter were measured on each
ABL80 FLEX CO-OX. Each sample was split with the reference method analyzer.

The SP80 CO-OX solution pack consists of four solution pouches. These solutions
are used for calibration and quality control of the ABL80 FLEX CO-OX system.
Each solution contains varying analyte concentrations. The true value for each
solution is assigned from testing during manufacture. During testing, Reference
Ampoules are tested at the same time as the solution lot.
The true values of the reference ampoules are determined using reference methods
specified at Radiometer Medical. The true values for pH are traceable to the
Chemical Reference Laboratory, Danish Accreditation no. 119 and to SRM from
NIST. All other parameters are traceable to SRM from NIST. The following SRM
types are used: SRM 1701, SRM 1702, SRM 1703, SRM 186 IF, SMR 186 IIf, SRM
919a, SRM 999, SRM 915, and SRM 917a.
Stability testing was performed to verify solution values over shelf life at minimum
and maximum storage temperatures. The stability is calculated from the difference
between the initial values of each parameter at the time of production and the final
values after storage at the maximum storage temperature until the product expires.
True values, QC assigned values, QC acceptance ranges, and decay coefficients are
programmed onto the solution pack iButton at time of manufacture. This information
is read into the analyzer at time of installation.
Listed below are representative nominal true values of each solution:

The optical system in the oximetry module is a spectrophotometer with a linear
output as a function of specific analyte concentrations. Because the raw instrument
output at low levels for some measured quantities can result in negative
concentrations, the user is able to truncate these as noted below.
The lower limit of detection (LLD) study was performed on 5 ABL80 FLEX CO-OX.
Samples were whole human blood prepared at test levels. A total of 75 samples per
level were tested. Each sample was split with 2 ABL735 reference analyzers. The
mean bias from reference and pooled precision estimates (reproducibility, S ) was
x
calculated for each level. They were then combined to obtain an estimate of total
error (TE) at each level, using TE = |Bias| + 2 x Sx. The 95% confidence interval
indicates the range in which a sample with a true value equal to the LLD will be
measured. A summary of results is shown in the below tables and is present in the
device labeling.

e. Analytical specificity:
A test of analytical specificity was performed using multiple potential interfering
substances. Either aqueous or whole blood samples were prepared with known
parameter concentrations at normal levels. The samples were split and spiked with
either the interferent (test), or an equal amount of diluent without interferent (control.)
Three replicates each of control (C) and test (T) samples were run for each substance
as follows: C, C1, T1, C, C2, T2, C, C3, T3.

Results:
The difference between the mean of C1, C2, C3 and T1, T2, T3 was calculated as the
amount of interference. The 95% Confidence Interval for the difference between two
means was used to determine if the mean difference between test and control samples
was statistically significant. If (3.5 * SD) < Mean ∆ < (3.5 * SD), the sponsor defined
that the difference in parameter between test and control samples is zero and
difference is not significant. The tables below summarize substances, test
concentrations, parameter concentrations, and test results. Values that are bold were
determined by the sponsor to be significant interference based on the above definition
and are noted in the reference manual.

Reference method comparison for oximetry (tHb, sO2, O Hb, HHb, COHb and
2
MetHb) was against ABL735 analyzers. Samples were heparinized whole blood from
healthy, voluntary donors. The blood was prepared to obtain high, mid, and low
concentration levels of each measured parameter covering the reportable range. For
ctHb, the plasma volume of the sample was adjusted to attain test levels. For sO and
2
FCOHb, the blood was mixed with an appropriate gas mixture to attain test levels.
For FMetHb and FHHb the blood was chemically treated to attain test levels using
sodium dithionite in TRIS-buffer for HHb and potassium nitrite in isotonic saline
solution for MetHb. Five replicates per level and parameter were measured on each
ABL80 FLEX CO-OX. Results are summarized below.

An additional study using 44 blood samples that spanned the test range for the
ABL80 Flex CO-OX was performed testing each sample once. Samples were
heparinzed whole human blood as well as altered human blood. The altered samples
(40 samples altered 4 samples unaltered) were prepared as follows: ctHb - blood was
spun to separate plasma and RBC. Plasma and RBC were remixed in varying ratios
to obtain ctHb levels. sO2, FO2Hb, FHHb > 0% - blood was treated with sodium
dithionite to remove O2 or mixed with O2 gas at varying levels. FCOHb - blood was
mixed with CO gas at varying levels. FMetHb - blood was treated with KNO2.
