I. Device Description:
The SAS™ FluAlert A & B Test is an immunoassay comprised of two strips in
one cassette. One strip utilizing monoclonal antibodies against influenza type A
nucleoproteins and the second strip utilizing influenza type B viral
nucleoproteins. In the presence of influenza A and/or influenza B, the antibody-
gold conjugate in the test membranes binds to the nucleoproteins and forms a
complex. This complex migrates across the membrane and is captured by
influenza A or influenza B antibodies in the membrane and forms visible pink
lines. To serve as a procedural control, a pink line will always appear in the
control zone of each strip regardless of the presence or absence of influenza A
or influenza B nucleoproteins.

L. Test Principle:
The SAS™ FluAlert A & B Test utilizes monoclonal antibodies against
influenza Type A and influenza Type B viral nucleoproteins. The test begins
with an extraction of nucleoproteins from the clinical specimen. The extracted
specimen is then placed into two separate sample wells and observed for the
formation of colored lines. The specimen is absorbed and migrates via capillary
action through membranes that contain dried gold conjugated antibody specific
for either influenza A or influenza B nucleoproteins. If Type A and/or Type B
nucleoproteins are present, they bind to the antibody-gold conjugate and form a
complex which migrates across the membrane and is captured by influenza A or
influenza B antibodies in the membrane. Thus, in the presence of influenza A
and influenza B nucleoproteins, an immuno-complex is formed and a visible
pink line develops in the specimen zones of the test device, in the A line for
influenza A and in the B line for influenza B. In the absence of influenza A
and/or influenza B antigens, an immuno-complex is not formed and a negative
result is indicated. To serve as a procedural control, a pink line should appear in
the control zones regardless of the presence or absence of influenza A and
influenza B nucleoproteins.
Interpretation of Results:
Expected Performance of Controls:
Internal Controls
Each test device includes an internal procedural control, a line in the C (control)
regions of the test device. Correct procedural technique, specimen flow and test
device performance is confirmed when a colored line appears in the C areas of
the membrane. If the colored line fails to appear in the C area of either strip, the
test result is invalid.
A clear background is an internal negative procedural control. The background
color should be white to light pink and should not interfere with the reading of
the test result. If a more intensely red background color appears, it may

interfere with the ability to read the test result, therefore the test should be
repeated.
External Controls
Negative and Positive controls for influenza A antigen and influenza B antigen
should be tested and the appropriate results obtained. External quality control
testing should be performed in conformance with local, state and federal
regulations or accreditation organizations as applicable, and should follow the
user’s laboratory’s standard quality control procedures. Controls in the SAS™
FluAlert Control Kit, catalog # 046230, are ready to use; do not dilute with
extraction buffer.
Specimen Results and Interpretation:
• The test is negative if a colored line appears only in the C (control) area on
both strips.
• The test is positive for Flu A if the line appears under S (specimen) on the
Flu A strip and a second line appears under the C on both strips. The test is
positive for Flu B if the line appears under S on the Flu B strip and a second
line appears under C on both strips. Any pink colored line in the specimen
(S) area, regardless of the intensity, is a positive result.
• While co-infections with both influenza A and influenza B viruses are rare
and no incidences were observed in the clinical studies, they might occur. If
there is a question about the test results, the test may be repeated.
• The test is invalid if no colored line appears in the C area on either strip,
even if a colored line appears in either S area. If this occurs, the test should
be repeated.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the SAS™ FluAlert A&B Test was evaluated at three
clinical sites. Three or four non-professional users per site tested the SAS™
FluAlert A&B Test against a panel of approximately 30 aliquots each of six
(6) panel members over a two-week period. Specimens were comprised of
pooled nasal aspirates and included two (2) levels of positives for influenza
A and two (2) for influenza B and one negative for each virus. The
influenza A panel members contained H3N2 A/Hong Kong/8/68 and the
influenza B panel members contained B/Allen/45. Negative specimens for
influenza A and influenza B were in concentrations below the limit of
detection.

The study demonstrated that the SAS™ FluAlert A&B Test did not cross-
react with any respiratory pathogens or commensal organisms tested. The
data demonstrated 100% concordance with the expected results.
Interference Study
The analytical specificity of the influenza A portion of the SAS™ FluAlert
A&B was evaluated by testing a panel of 22 viruses, 14 bacteria, and one
yeast species which may be found in the respiratory tract. For the influenza
A portion of the test, influenza whole virus strain A/FM/147 (ATCC VR97)
at a titer of 7.9 x 103 TCID /0.2 ml was added to viral cultures and viral
50
antigens at the concentrations listed in the table below and bacterial and
yeast cultures at concentrations of 1 x 108 cfu/ml. For the influenza B
portion of the test, whole virus strain B/Mass/3/66 (ATCC VR523) at a titer
of 3.2 x 103 TCID /0.2 ml. was added to viral cultures in the concentrations

Prospective Clinical Study
The SAS™ FluAlert A&B Test combines the immunoassay test strips from
the individual SAS™ Influenza A and SAS™ Influenza B Tests into one
side-by-side plastic cassette. There are no other changes made to this test.
In these studies, the users compared the combined test to the individual tests
for evaluation of user interpretations. Please see: “Results Summary:
SAS™ Influenza A and SAS™ Influenza B Individual Devices compared to
cell culture or DFA” chart for comparison of the individual tests to cell
culture/DFA.
Four clinical trial sites, in Texas and South Dakota, tested four hundred
sixty one (461) nasal clinical specimens blindly and prospectively
comparing the SAS™ Influenza A Test and The SAS™ FluAlert A&B
(combined) Test performance. The SAS™ Influenza A Test and SAS™
FluAlert A&B Test had a positive percent agreement of 97.2% and a
negative percent agreement of 99.7%. Thirteen samples yielded invalid
results. .

Retrospective Study
To supplement the prospective study, 191 frozen, archived, nasal wash samples
from a children’s hospital in Texas were blindly assayed comparing the individual
SAS™ Influenza A Test and the individual SAS™ Influenza B Test to the SAS™
FluAlert A&B (combined) Test. For these samples, the positive percent agreement
with the influenza A Test is 100% and negative percent agreement is 99.3%, while
positive percent agreement with the Influenza B Test was 94.7% and negative
percent agreement is 98.0%

SAS™ Influenza A and SAS™ Influenza B individual devices compared
to cell culture or DFA.
The performance of the SAS™ Influenza A and SAS™ Influenza B
individual devices was established during the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 flu
seasons, at clinical sites in Iowa, Virginia, and South Dakota. A total of 263
and 255 clinical specimens, respectively, were tested using the SAS
Influenza A and Influenza B devices and the results were compared to cell
culture or DFA. Specimens were comprised of leftover nasopharyngeal

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Influenza prevalence varies year to year, with the highest number of cases in
the fall and winter months in the US. During the period of September 30,
2007 to April 5, 2008, prevalence in the US for both influenza A and
influenza B was 18.5%, with 74% of those cases attributed to influenza A
and 26% attributed to influenza B. For studies conducted on the SAS™
FluAlert A&B Test, during the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons,
prevalence for fresh, prospective nasal washes and nasal aspirates was
15.1% for influenza A and 16.5% for influenza B.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part
809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and
supports a substantial equivalence decision.
