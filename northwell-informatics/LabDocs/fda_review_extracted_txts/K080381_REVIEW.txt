H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use section below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Quest Diagnostics Methamphetamine Micro-Plate EIA is intended for the
qualitative detection of Methamphetamine in oral fluid collected with the
OrasureTM Oral Specimen Collection Device. It is a screen test with a cutoff of 40
ng/ml.
The Quest Diagnostics Methamphetamine Micro-Plate EIA provides only a
preliminary result. Clinical consideration and professional judgment must
be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly in evaluating a
preliminary positive result. To obtain confirmed analytical results a more
specific alternate chemical method is needed. Gas chromatography/mass
spectroscopy (GC/MS) is the recommended confirmatory method.
The Quest Diagnostics Methamphetamine Micro-Plate EIA Calibrators are
intended for medical purposes and for use only with the Quest Diagnostics
Methamphetamine Micro-Plate EIA to establish points of reference that are used
in the determination of values in the measurement of methamphetamine in oral
fluid samples collected with OraSureTM Oral Specimen Collection Device.

L. Test Principle:
The Quest Diagnostics Methamphetamine Micro-Plate EIA is a competitive
immunoassay for the qualitative determination of Methamphetamine in oral fluid
specimens. Methamphetamine in oral fluid and the methamphetamine in the enzyme
conjugate compete for the limited binding sites of antibody fixed to a microtiter plate.
If little or no methamphetamine is present in the specimen, more enzyme labeled
methamphetamine will be bound by methamphetamine antibody. If a large or
significant amount of methamphetamine is present in the specimen, less enzyme
labeled methamphetamine will be bound to the plate, reducing overall activity and
signal level. The absorbance produced is inversely proportional to the amount of
methamphetamine in the specimen, calibrator or control.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed on 5 negative patient samples by spiking
with 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 ng/ml of methamphetamine; drug
concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS. These concentrations correspond
to 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150 and 175% of the cutoff. Testing was performed
in replicates of 4 for 10 days for 8 concentrations. The results are shown in the
table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. This assay is intended for qualitative use.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
All calibrator and control stock solutions are prepared from commercially
available solutions. The methamphetamine concentrations of the stock
solution were determined by GC/MS. From the stock solution, a secondary
stock solution was prepared gravimetrically. The positive control was
prepared from the secondary stock. The cutoff calibrator, negative control
and low negative control were prepared by serial dilutions of the positive
controls. All of the components were confirmed by GC/MS.
Claimed shelf-life of the Quest Diagnostics Methamphetamine Micro-Plate
EIA calibrator and controls is 110 days for when stored at 2-8 C. The Quest
Diagnostics Methamphetamine Micro-Plate EIA reagents are stable at room
temperature (21-25 C) for 30 days. Real-time studies are ongoing.
The stability of methamphetamine in the OraSure collection device was
determined by taking a pool of negative oral fluid samples spiked at ten
different concentrations. The samples were run at day one with the EIA
device and leftover samples were stored at room temperature (21-25 ˚C) for
28 days. Those stored samples were tested again with the EIA device for
direct comparison with day one results. The result support the sponsor’s
claim that saliva specimens collected with the OraSure collection devices
remain stable for at least 28 days when stored at 21 -25 ˚C.
Shipment stability was assessed by spiking eight negative neat saliva samples
(in pairs) with various concentrations of methamphetamine. One set was
shipped within the US and returned. The shipped collection devices testing
results were compared to that of the non-shipped collection device. The
results showed that shipping did not after the performance of the Quest
Diagnostics Methamphetamine Micro-Plate EIA device and that the results
were identical for both the shipped and non-shipped devices.
d. Detection limit:
See the precision/reproducibility section above for performance around the
stated cutoff concentration.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity of structurally similar compounds was determined by spiking
concentrations of different drugs into negative oral fluid. Fourteen members
of the amphetamine family, and structurally similar compounds, (see table
5

--- Page 6 ---
below) were tested for cross reactivity to the Quest Diagnostics
Methamphetamine Micro-Plate EIA using d-Methamphetamine as the 100%
reference. A negative pool was spiked with 4,000 ng/ml of each compound;
three substances (MDMA, PMA and PMMA) tested positive at that level were
tested with further dilutions until a negative result was produced. The Quest
Diagnostics EIA produced the following cross-reactivity results
methamphetamine.

f. Assay cut-off:
The sponsor conducted a cutoff study in which the cutoff calibrator was tested
in triplicate by GC/MS to verify their chosen cutoff of 40 ng/ml. Five aliquots
of pooled negative patient specimens were spiked with 0, 20, 30, 50 and 60
ng/ml methamphetamine. The concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS and
were run in replicates of 20 with the Quest Diagnostics Methamphetamine
Micro-Plate EIA. The results shown below support the sponsor chosen cutoff
of 40 ng/mL.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
One-hundred patient samples were collected in accordance with the OraSure
collection device test insert by trained professionals from Quest diagnostics.
Specimens were stored at 2-8 ˚C prior to testing. Specimen results from the
Quest Diagnostics Methamphetamine Micro-Plate EIA device was compared
to GC/MS reference method (with 40 ng/ml as the cutoff).

1All four specimens were tested by GC/MS and contain MDMA, a compound
know to produce positive results with the Quest EIA at 35 ng/ml (cross-reactivity
of 117.3%). Three (3) specimens contained more than 35 ng/ml MDMA (38, 100,
480 ng/ml respectively). One specimen contained 31 ng/ml MDMA and 16 ng/ml
Methamphetamine. The combined reactivities produced a positive result with the
Quest EIA, as would be expected given the cross-reactivity rate for MDMA.
2Among these six false positive specimens by EIA, all had Methamphetamine
concentrations in the range of -50% to Cutoff (31, 31, 25, 23, 33, 35 ng/ml
respectively). Two specimens also had significant amounts MDMA (32 & 135
ng/ml respectively).
