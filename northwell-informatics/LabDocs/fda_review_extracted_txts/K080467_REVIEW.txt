This assay provided only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid
Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) are the preferred confirmatory
method.
Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of
abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.

4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable, as the devices are visually-read single-use devices.
I. Device Description:
BionexiaTM Single and Multi-Strip DOA test has two formats: cassette and dipstick.
These two formats are manufactured with the same formulation, components, and
manufacturing processes. The Cassette contains a test in a plastic housing with a
specimen well and a window to read the test results. A specimen pipette is included
with the Test Device, but a specimen collection container is not included with either
test format. Amphetamine, Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines, Cocaine, Marijuana,
Morphine 2000, Methamphetamine, Methadone, Phencyclidine, Nortriptyline were
previously cleared for professional laboratory use (k061005)and are being cleared for
point of care (POC) use in this submission. In addition, 4 new analytes (MDMA,
EDDP, BUP and MOR 300) are being cleared for professional POC use.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
ACON One Step Ecstasy Screen Test
ACON One Step Morphine 300 Test
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
k022589, k013380
3. Comparison with predicate:
The device is similar to or the same as to the previously cleared predicate(s) in the
following ways: test principles, indication for use, cut-off concentration(s), use in
a professional setting, sample matrix, endpoint, and test time.
The devices differ by manufacturer, specific monoclonal antibodies used, the
analytes detected, and the proposed device is cleared for use in point-of-care
settings.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced by the manufacturer.
L. Test Principle:
The BionexiaTM DOA Screen Panels are immunoassays in which chemically labeled
drugs (drug-protein conjugates) compete for limited antibody binding sites with drugs
which may be present in urine. The test device contains membrane strips which are
pre-coated with drug-protein conjugates on the test band(s). On each strip, the drug
antibody-colloidal gold conjugate pad is placed at one end of the membrane. In the
absence of drug in the urine, the solution of the colored antibody-colloidal gold
conjugate move along with the sample solution upward chromatographically by
capillary action across the membrane to the immobilized drug-protein conjugate zone
on the test band region. The colored antibody-gold conjugate then attaches to the
drug-protein conjugates to form visible lines as the antibody complex with the drug
conjugate. Therefore, the formation of the visible line in the test zone occurs when the
test urine is negative for the drug. When the drug is present in the urine, the
3

--- Page 4 ---
drug/metabolite antigen competes with drug-protein conjugate on the test band region
for the limited antibody. When a sufficient concentration of the drug is present, it
will fill the limited antibody binding sites. This will prevent attachment of the colored
antibody (drug-protein conjugate)-colloidal gold conjugate to the drug-protein
conjugate zone on the test band region. Therefore, absence of the color band on the
test region indicates a positive result.
A control band with a different antigen/antibody reaction is added to the
immunochromatographic membrane strip at the control region (C) to indicate that
sufficient sample volume has been added. This control line should always appear
regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite. If the control line does not appear
the test device should be considered invalid.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The point of care (POC) precision study was conducted at three physician’s
office sites by untrained operators. 3 different lots (one lot per site) of product
(Dipstick (strip) for all 13 analytes; Cassette and Dipstick for MOR 300) were
used to demonstrate the within run, between run and between operator
precision. Each product lot was tested by using GC/MS confirmed controls
(LC/MS confirmed controls for BUP) at concentration levels of negative,
50%, 75%, 125%, and 150% of the cutoff. Each concentration level was tested
5 times a day for 3 days continuously. There was no significant difference in
precision between the two lots or between the readers:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. The assay is intended for qualitative use.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device has internal process controls. A red line appearing in the control
region confirms sufficient sample volume and adequate membrane wicking.
Users are informed not to interpret the test if no line forms in the control
region.
Control standards are not supplied with this device; however it is good
laboratory practice to confirm the test procedure and to verify proper test
performance. Users should follow all applicable guidelines for testing QC
materials.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical performance of the device around the cutoff is described in Section
1.M.f below.
e. Analytical specificity:
The specificity of the new BionexiaTM DOA Screen tests (MDMA, EDDP,
BUP, and MOR 300) was evaluated by adding various drugs, drug
metabolites, and other structurally similar compounds that are likely to be
present in drug-free normal human urine. To evaluate the positive cross-
reactivity concentration of the substance, tested substances were added into
commercial negative normal urine control to verify the lowest concentrations
which indicate a positive result. The following compounds were tested for
cross-reactivity in the drug strip and found to be positive if the levels were
greater than the following listed concentrations (in ng/ml).

Non Cross-Reacting Compounds
Potential interferences to the Bionexia drugs of abuse tests were evaluated by
adding various drugs, drug metabolies, and other compounds that are
commonly found in the urine which may interfere with test result. All
compounds were prepared in drug free pooled human urine or GC/MS
confirmed urine controls. The following compounds were found not to cross-
react when tested at concentrations at 100 µg/ml.
Acetaminophen Furosemide
Acetone Guaiacol Glyceryl Ether
Albumin Hemoglobin
Amitriptyline Ibuprofen
Ampicillin Imipramine (Except TCA)
Aspartame (+/-)-Isoproterenol
Aspirin Lidocaine
Atropine N-Methyl-Ephedrine
Benzocaine (+)-Naproxen
Bilirubin Oxalic Acid
Caffeine Penicillin-G
Chloroquine Pheniramine
Chlorpheniramine Phenothiazine
Creatine L-Phenylephrine
Dextrorphan tartrate β-Phenylethylamine
4-Dimethylaminoantipyrine Procaine
Dopamine Quinidine
(+/-)-Ephedrine Ranitidine
(-)-Ephedrine Sulindac
Erythromycin Tyramine
Ethanol Vitamin C
To evaluate the effect of pH value on the test results, GC/MS confirmed urine
controls at zero concentration, 75%. 125%, and 3X of cutoff were used. Each
control level was adjusted by either 7N NaOH or 7N HCl to the pH level at 3,
5, 6.5, 7.5 and 8.5. For evaluate specific gravity effect, negative urine
samples containing low to high specific gravity levels were collected and
pooled to prepared the following levels: 1.00, 1.01, 1.02 and 1.03. The target
drug was added to the pooled urines at the following drug levels: negative, -
25%, +25% and 3X of cutoff. The BionexiaTM DOA Screen Panels
performances at cutoff point are not affected by pH range of urine specimens
of 3.0 to 8.5 or a specific gravity range of 1.005 to 1.03.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cutoff of BionexiaTM DOA Screen Panels (MDMA, EDDP, BUP, and
MOR 300) were determined by testing GC/MS confirmed controls to the
concentrations at negative, -50% cutoff,

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance of the BionexiaTM DOA Screen panels was established by
comparing the results of unaltered urine samples against GC/MS (LC/MS for
BUP). Both the cassette and dipstick versions of the test were evaluated.
MDMA: In this study, one hundred twenty six (126) unaltered negative and
positive urine samples (0 to 21616 ng/ml) were tested by cassette and dipstick
device and were compared with GC/MS and compared to GC/MS. The results
are summarized below:

The POC Method Comparison Study was performed at one POC site with 3
operators by evaluating negative and positive clinical urine specimens
(including unaltered urine specimens and near cutoff level urine specimens
that were diluted by a urine negative control). Approximately 20 to 26 urine
samples were tested for each drug/analyte. More than half of tested samples
were in between +/-50% of the cutoffs. The results are summarized in the
