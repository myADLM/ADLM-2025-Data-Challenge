L. Test Principle:
The assay principle combines a 2-step enzyme immunoassay sandwich method with a final
fluorescent detection (ELFA). The Solid Phase Receptacle (SPR®) serves as the solid phase
as well as the pipetting device for the assay. Reagents for the assay are ready-to-use and pre-
dispensed in the sealed reagent strips. All of the assay steps are performed automatically by
the instrument. The reaction medium is cycled in and out of the SPR several times.
The sample is cycled in and out of the SPR several times. This operation enables the
monoclonal 115D8 antibody fixed onto the interior wall of the SPR to capture the reactive
antigenic determinants present in the sample. Unbound components are eliminated during the
washing steps. Alkaline phosphatase labeled monoclonal DF3 antibody is then incubated in
the SPR where it binds with the DF3 reactive antigenic determinants. Unbound conjugate is
then eliminated during the washing steps. During the final detection step, the substrate (4-
Methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate) is cycled in and out of the SPR. The conjugate enzyme
catalyzes the hydrolysis of this substrate into a fluorescent product (4-Methyl-umbelliferone)
the fluorescence of which is measured at 450 nm. The intensity of the fluorescence is
proportional to the concentration of CA 15-3 reactive antigenic determinants present in the
sample. At the end of the assay, results are automatically calculated by the instrument in
relation to the calibration curve stored in memory, and then printed out.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision and Reproducibility were carried out at three sites. Three pooled samples
covering the assay range were tested in duplicate, 2 runs per day for a period of 20
days, with 2 reagent lots. Two separate calibrations were performed on each lot
followed by 10 testing days per calibration. A total of 40 values were generated per
sample, site, and lot, and the precision and reproducibility is summarized in the table
below. The mean value (U/mL) for each pool appears in parentheses.

High Dose Hook Effect:
A serum sample with high CA 15-3 (approximately 13,000 U/mL) was tested with
three separate manufactured lots. The undiluted sample gave a Relative Fluorescence
Value (RFV) signal near or above the approximate VIDAS fluorescent signal
saturation point. The sample was diluted to 1/28 with sample diluent and the data
plotted to demonstrate the RFV signal relative to the calculated concentration. No
high dose hook effect was observed for CA 15-3 concentrations up to 13,000 U/mL.

specific assay calibrator (S1) and control (C1), and 5 internal control sera and
performed over an 8 week period. The first week seven (7) runs were performed on
the 3 VIDAS #1 instruments, one per kit lot, using the working standards to establish
the Master Curve for the kit lots. An additional 15 runs were performed on the
remaining 3 instruments (#2) using the working standards and lot-specific S1 in
duplicate, and 5 internal control sera and lot-specific C1 in singlet. The runs were
repeated on weeks 2-8, one run per week on the two VIDAS #2 instruments. The
assay was calibrated every 14 and 28 days. The concentrations obtained by total
calibration were not significantly different from those obtained by systematic
recalibration or 14 day/28 day recalibration indicating the assay can be recalibrated
with the kit lot-specific calibrator, tested in duplicate, at a frequency of 14 days.
Calibrator and control stability is 12 months when stored at 2-8ºC. Reconstituted
calibrator and control stability is 2 weeks when stored at 2-8ºC or 7 months when
stored at -25 ± 6ºC.
Freeze/thaw calibrator stability: One lot of control and calibrator was tested. The
acceptance criterion was target concentration plus 3 standard deviations. Frozen
calibrator was demonstrated to be able to undergo up to five freeze/thaw cycles..
d. Detection limit:
Limits of blank, detection, and quantitation were determined using 2 kit lots on 2
instruments (one per lot) using CLSI protocol EP17-A. Five low CA 15-3 samples
were tested using two lots on two VIDAS instruments. Tested CA 15-3 values
ranged from approximately 0.79 to 1.38 U/mL. Acceptance criteria for the limit of
blank, detection, and quantitation were described as follows:
• Limit of blank (LOB) – highest measurement result which has a 95%
probability to be observed for a blank sample. It is the 95th percentile of a
blank distribution
• Limit of detection (LOD) – lowest amount of analyte that can be detected
with 95% probability, though not quantified at an exact value.
• Limit of quantitation (LOQ) – lowest actual amount of analyte that can be
reliably detected and at which total error meets lab requirements for
accuracy.
The results support a claim for LOB, LOD and LOQ of less than 2 U/mL. Therefore,
the lowest value for the range of the assay is 2 U/mL.

and 27 anti-cancer and over-the-counter (OTC)-drug interferents were evaluated for
interference when added to three human serum samples containing very low, low, and
moderate concentrations of CA 15-3 (approximately 7, 32, and 217 U/mL,
respectively). The stock solutions of HAMA, RF, and albumin interferents were
prepared by initially dissolving the HAMA and RF in human plasma and the albumin
in water, prior to spiking into the CA 15-3 containing serum samples. Each sample
was divided into two aliquots and one spiked with the potential interferents and the
other spiked with buffer only. Three intermediate levels were prepared by variable
7

--- Page 8 ---
mixing of the two aliquots. Aliquots of each concentration were tested in single
replicates in three runs. None of the potential interferents (see table below) were
found to significantly influence this assay where acceptance was defined as the mean
± 2SD relative to the blank.
Interferent Concentrations tested
Hemoglobin 0 – 312 umol/L
Triglyceride 0 – 30 g/L
Bilirubin 0 – 513 umol/L
Human albumin 0 – 150 mg/mL
Rheumatoid factor 0 – 100.5 IU/mL
HAMA 0 – 912.5 mg/mL
A CA 15-3 positive serum pool with a CA 15-3 concentration of 67.7 ± 10.38 U/mL
was spiked with each drug listed in the table below, at a final concentration of at least
3X its therapeutic dose. No significant interference was noted for tested drugs and all
% recoveries were within the acceptance range of 90-110%.
Tested interfering drugs
5-fluorouracil Acetaminophen
N-acetyl-L-cysteine Acetylsalycilic acid
Ampicillin Ascorbic acid
Bleomycin Carboplatin
Cefoxitin Cisplatin
Cyclophosphamide Cyclosporine
Dactinomycin Doxocycline
Doxorubicin Etoposide
Ibuprofen Levodopa
Methotrexate Metronidazole

Cross-reactivity:
Cross-reactivity with β-hCG, AFP, CEA, CA 19-9, CA 125, Prostate-specific antigen
(PSA), and Prostatic Acid Phosphatase (PAP) was assessed using calibrators from the
respective TOSOH assays. A human serum-based diluent served as a blank. All
samples gave no CA 15-3 value, which was the acceptance criterion for this analysis.
The samples and concentrations tested are:
• β-hCG - 206 mIU/mL • PSA - 52 ng/mL
• AFP - 201 ng/mL • PAP – 19.3 ng/mL
• CEA - 49.6 ng/mL • CA 125 - 1100 U/mL
• CA 19-9 - 423 U/mL

f. Assay cut-off:
The sponsor defines a 12% percentage change in CA 15-3 values as significant for
patients being serially monitored. The significant change is 2.5 times the total
imprecision of the CA 15-3 assay across sites, lots, and concentration (expressed as
%CV = 4.30%). The sponsor chose this value to ensure that the change in CA 15-3
value is not attributed to assay variation.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A study consisting of 1035 paired samples representing normal, benign, and
malignant conditions were included. The benign conditions included urogenital, GI
tract/lung, breast, diabetes, heart disease/hypertension, and benign liver disease.
Malignant conditions included treated cancers of the lung, liver, colorectal, breast,
ovarian, uterine and cervix, and “other” cancers (gall bladder, gastric, pancreatic,
etc.). CA 15-3 results were assayed using the VIDAS® CA 15-3 (Y) assay and the
predicate assay (X). The results were analyzed by Deming regression analysis and
are presented below.
Y = 0.96X – 1.94
95% Confidence interval for the intercept: - 4.90 to 1.01 U/mL
95% Confidence interval for the slope: 0.83 to 1.09
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable since only serum specimens are utilized.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
Not applicable.
b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. is not applicable):
The samples utilized in this study were from subjects with breast cancer obtained
from retrospective sample banks at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Serial sets must
include a minimum of 3 draws (4 draws or more desired) per subject. Samples were
blood draws performed at or after diagnosis throughout as much of the clinical course
as possible. Clinical information which detailed the disease status for each sample
and types of any therapy received with the dates of administration was collected.
Initially 80 evaluable serial sets were collected from subjects with confirmed breast
cancer (Stage I – IV), yielding 353 individual samples. CA 15-3 values were
obtained from a total of 273 evaluable observation pairs and the change between
visits for serial samples was compared to the change in disease state. The average
age of the 80 subjects was 49 years (median 48.0 yrs, SD = 10.9 yrs). Caucasian
subjects comprised 78% of the sample set, Hispanic 12.5%, and Asian 1.8%. The
average number of observation pairs per subject was 3.41, the median number of
observation pairs per subject was 3, and the average number of draws per subject was
4.41.
The outcome of interest was defined as progression of disease from time point i
(clinical visit i, i=1 to n-1) to a succeeding time point j (clinical visit j, j=i+1 to n).
The number of clinical visits for which samples and data are available is defined as n.
9

--- Page 10 ---
The visit number made by a study subject is at the time of diagnosis or after diagnosis
and prior to death, loss to follow-up or remission of disease. The sponsor statistically
defines w as a variable representing disease progression and has 2 values as follows:
ij
1 if there is disease progression from visit i to visit j
0 if no progression (stable disease, response to therapy) from visit i to visit j
Disease progression is determined by the subject’s physician and is based on any or a
composite of physical signs/symptoms, results of lab tests for colorectal cancer,
radiographic findings (CAT scans, PET scans, MRI, x-ray, or ultrasound), or patient
reported symptoms.
The sponsor defined the variable v as 1 if the difference in value of the test assay at
ij
visit i (x) and value of the test assay at a later visit j (x) is greater than or equal to
i j
12.0% (i.e. v = 1 if (x – x) ≥ 12.0%). The variable v is 0 if the difference is
ij j i ij
otherwise (i.e. v = 0 if (x – x) < 12.0%). The sponsor chose this value to ensure that
ij j i
the change in CA 15-3 value is not attributed to assay variation and is statistically
significant. According to the predicate’s package insert, a positive (significant
change) is defined as an increase of more than 10%. To determine an association
between the variables w (disease progression) and v (change in CA 15-3 value) a 2 x
2 contingency table can be constructed to find an association between variables.
Items in each of the 4 cells represent pairs of v and w (1 and/or 0) for visits for all
subjects (or for subjects only). Concordance between the significance of the change
in CA 15-3 values between visits and the recorded change in the patient’s disease
state was reported as percent agreement.

A second analysis of the same study data was performed, in which the subjects
diagnosed as Stage I who never increased in stage were omitted from the analysis.
From the Stage II – IV patients, there were a total of 316 evaluable observations
yielding 246 observation pairs. The breakdown of the serial sets is presented in Table
1 in the submission. The average number of observation pairs per subject is 3.5 and
the median number of observation pairs per subject was 3.
