L. Test Principle:
The Access Myoglobin assay is a two-site immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay. A
sample is added to a reaction vessel with the mouse monoclonal anti-myoglobin
alkaline phosphatase conjugate, mouse monoclonal anti-myoglobin-biotin conjugate,
and paramagnetic particles coated with a goat polyclonal anti-biotin. Human serum
myoglobin binds to anti-myoglobin biotin conjugate and is immobilized on
paramagnetic particles coated with goat anti-biotin antibody, while the mouse anti-
myoglobin alkaline phosphatase conjugate reacts specifically with a different
antigenic site on the myoglobin molecule. After incubation in a reaction vessel,
materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound
materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phos 530 is
added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a
luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the concentration of
myoglobin in the sample. The amount of analyte in the sample is determined from a
stored, multi-point calibration curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were designed according to the CLSI EP5-A2 guideline.
Five levels of control materials were measured twice a day in duplicate on two
separate UniCel DxI 800 analyzers for 20 days. The results from one of the
two instruments (N=80) are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study across the entire measuring range was assessed using the
UniCel DxI 800 analyzer. Two previously frozen spiked serum samples were
analyzed in this study, one sample at greater than 4000 ng/mL and a second
lower sample at approximately 70 ng/mL. Five dilutions were prepared from
both of these samples using Sample Diluent A as the diluent. All samples
were tested in replicates of seven in random order. The range of the samples
tested was from 0.64 – 4179 ng/mL. The values were plotted for the expected
concentrations (X) verses the observed concentrations (Y) and an appropriate
line fitted by standard linear regressions was calculated. The linear regression
correlation is Y= 1.012X + 6.641, (95%CI for slope is 0.98 to 1.043 and
intercept is -36.9 to 50.19).
The data provided support the sponsor’s claims that the reportable range of
this assay is 1- 4000ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Access Myoglobin Calibrators is traceable to the in-house calibrations. See
k021229
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) determination was based on multiple measurements
of the Myoglobin calibrator, S0, on multiple instruments. The mean, SD, and
% CV were calculated. The limit of blank for Myoglobin as determined by
being distinguishable from zero with 95% confidence is 0.215 ng/mL on DxI
800. Limit of Detections (LoD) determination was based on measurements
of 4 low samples in replicates of 7 on a DxI 800 analyzer according to CLSI
EP17-A. The sponsor claimed that the LoD is 0.762 ng/mL.
The Access Myoglobin assay has a reportable range of 1-4000 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were designed according to the CLSI EP7-A guideline. A
normal human serum was spiked with the known interference substances and
analyzed in replicate of ten on the DxI 800 analyzer. No significant
interference was defined as the observed value <10% of the expected value
(neat sample). The sponsor claimed that there was no significant interference
(<10%) by the following interferents:
• Hemoglobin up to 500 mg/dL
• Bilirubin up to 40 mg/dL
• Triglycerides (triolein) up to 3000 mg/dL
5

--- Page 6 ---
• Human serum albumin up to 6000 mg/dL
The sponsor has the following limitations in their labeling:
“For assays employing antibodies, the possibility exists for interference by
heterophile antibodies in the patient sample. Patients who have been regularly
exposed to animals or have received immunotherapy or diagnostic procedures
utilizing immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments may produce
antibodies, e.g. HAMA, that interferes with immunoassays. Additionally,
other heterophile antibodies such as human anti-goat antibodies may be
present in patient samples. Such interfering antibodies may cause erroneous
results. Carefully evaluate the results of patients suspected of having these
antibodies.”
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed at an internal site. A total of 110
serum samples were evaluated using UniCel DxI 800 (candidate) and Access
2 (predicate). Deming regression analyses were used to evaluate the
correlations between results obtained using the UniCel DxI 800 and Access 2.
Correlation regression is summarized below:
Y = 0.93X + 7.47, r2 = 0.99, range of sample tested = 32.3 – 3748 ng/mL
(X= Access 2 and Y= UniCel DxI 800)
b. Matrix comparison:
In the labeling, the sponsor recommends serum, EDTA and heparinized
plasma as the samples to use. Matrix comparisons between all the sample
types were previously performed on the Access 2 analyzer. See previously
cleared submission, k021229
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:

b. Clinical specificity:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
A reference range study was performed by evaluating 277 healthy subjects (140
males and 137 females, age range from 22-93) on the Access 2 analyzer. The
cen
tral 95% reference intervals for different sample types were determined as
follows:
Sample type Sex Reference intervals (ng/mL)
Heparin plasma and serum Females 14.3-65.8
Males 17.4-105.7
EDTA plasma Females 11.1-57.5
Males 15.2 – 91.2
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
