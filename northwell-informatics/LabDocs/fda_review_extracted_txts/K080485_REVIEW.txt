I. Device Description:
The DiaSys aspartate amino transferase (AST) assay is supplied as ready-to-use, liquid
reagents with two formats (with or without pyridoxal-5’-phosphate). The first format is a two
reagents format without P-5-P, which consists of reagent A and reagent B. The second format
is a three reagents format, which consists of reagent A, reagent B, and a third optional
reagent, which is pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (P-5-P). For the two-reagent method, the entire
contents of reagent B are added to reagent A and are mixed well before use. For the three-
reagent method, reagent A, reagent B and pyridoxal-5'-phosphate are not mixed together.
Components included in the reagents are listed below:
1. Reagent A (Enzyme reagent) contains Tris buffer, pH 7.65 (110 mmol/L), L-Aspartate
(320 mmol/L), lactate dehydrogenase (≥ 1200 U/L), and malate dehydrogenase (≥ 800
U/L).
2. Reagent B (substrate) contains 2-Oxoglutarate (65 mmol/L) and NADH (1 mmol/L).

L. Test Principle:
AST catalyses the transfer of amino group from aspartate to oxoglutarate during the
formation of glutamate and oxaloacetate. Oxaloacetate is reduced to malate by malate
dehydrogenase (MDH). During this conversion, an equivalent amount of NADH is oxidized
to NAD. The resulting decrease in absorbance at 340 nm is directly proportional to the
activity of AST in serum.
Addition of pyridoxal-5-phosphate (P-5-P) stabilizes the transaminases and avoids falsely
low values in samples containing insufficient endogenous P-5-P.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was evaluated according to CLSI EP5-A guideline using three
levels of serum samples. Samples were run twice per day in duplicate for 20 days on
the Hitachi 917 analyzer (N=80). Precision data was calculated and summarized
below:
Precision for method with P-5-P on the Hitachi 917 analyzer:

Sample 1 42.0 1.08 2.42 2.84

Sample 2 74.0 1.13 3.95 5.06
Sample 3 560 0.83 0.57 1.30
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was evaluated across the entire measuring range. A low serum
sample and a high serum sample were mixed to prepare 11 different concentrations of
AST and then diluted with saline (the recommended diluent). Each concentration
was tested in quadruplicate and range tested was 0- 900 U/L for both methods (with
P-5-P and without P-5-P) on the Hitachi 917 analyzer. Values were plotted for the
expected concentrations (X) versus the observed concentrations (Y) and an
appropriate line fitted by Passing Bablok method was calculated as follows:
With P-5-P: y= 0.997x+0.046, r=0.9998
Without-P-5-P: y=0.999x+0.001, r=0.9997
The data provided supports the sponsor’s claim that the assay has a reportable range
of 7-700 U/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The DiaSys ASAT (GOT) FS assay is standardized against IFCC reference method.
The two reagent format without P-5-P is traceable to the modified IFCC formulation
while the three reagent format with P-5-P is traceable to the original IFCC
formulation.
Value Assignment:
The concentration of the TruCal U calibrator, TruLab N and P controls are lot-
specific and given in the value sheet of the corresponding lot. The value was
determined using either the two reagent method without P-5-P or the three reagent
method with P-5-P and by using the reagents specified by the method formats.
Determinations of the value were performed under an internal protocol against a
TruCal U master lot.

Stability of the TruCal U calibrator, TruLab N and P controls:
The shelf life and open vial stability testing protocols for the calibrators and controls
and the acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
A detection limit study was evaluated according to CLSI EP17-A guideline. The
Limit of Blank (LoB) is defined as the highest value expected to see in a series of
results on a sample that contains no analyte. The Limit of Detection (LoD) is the
smallest amount that the method can reliably detect to determine presence or absence
of an analyte. The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) is the smallest amount the assay can
reliably measure quantitatively and at which the uncertainty of the observed test result
is less than or equal to the goal set (total error of a CV≤ 20%). LoB was determined
by running a blank sample 60 times on the Hitachi 917 analyzer. The limit of
detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were determined by running 4 low
samples 60 times on the Hitachi 917. The detection limits are calculated as follows:
For method with P-5-P: LoB= 0.78 U/L, LoD=1.26 U/L, and LoQ=1.26 U/L
For method without P-5-P: LoB= 1.30 U/L, LoD=1.84 U/L, and LoQ=1.84 U/L
The reportable range for the assay is 7 – 700 U/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was evaluated to determine the effect of common interference
substances according to the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. Two levels of human serum
pools with different AST were tested. The following interference substances were
tested: conjugated bilirubin, unconjugated bilirubin, hemoglobin, ascorbic acid and
triglyceride. Stock solutions of the above chemicals were prepared and spiked into
the tested samples with different concentrations. The % bias was calculated based on
the differences between the spiked sample and the pool sample. The sponsor’s
acceptance criterion was <10% bias for the interferences to be considered as not
significant. Results of the hemoglobin study demonstrated significant interference for
hemoglobin; thus, the sponsor recommends that user not to use hemolyzed samples
for this test and this information is provided in the labeling.
Results of the interference studies of various potential interferents were shown as
follows:
For method without P-5-P:
Conjugated bilirubin: Interference ≤ 10% for up to 60 mg/dL conj. bilirubin
Unconjugated bilirubin: Interference ≤ 10% for up to 24 mg/dL unconj.bilirubin
Triglycerides: Interference ≤ 10% for up to 400 mg/dL triglycerides
Ascorbic acid: Interference ≤ 10% for up to 30 mg/dL ascorbic acid

For method with P-5-P:
Conjugated bilirubin: Interference ≤ 10% for up to 36 mg/dL conj. bilirubin
Unconjugated bilirubin: Interference ≤ 10% for up to 24 mg/dL unconj.bilirubin
Triglycerides: Interference ≤ 10% for up to 400 mg/dL triglycerides
Ascorbic acid: Interference ≤ 10% for up to 30 mg/dL ascorbic acid

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed using the DiaSys ASAT FS assay
(candidate device) for both methods (with and without P-5-P) according to CLSI
EP9-A2 guideline. Patient serum and lithium heparin plasma samples were used to
evaluate against the Roche AST assay (predicate device). In order to cover the hard-
to-find sample range some of the samples were spiked. All testing were performed
using the Hitachi 917 analyzer. The method used to fit the linear regression line was
Passing Bablok. A summary of the regression statistics is provided below:
