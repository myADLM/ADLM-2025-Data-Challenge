The IDEAL LIFE Pod™ receives data wirelessly from IDEAL LIFE devices to
transmit over the Internet or common telephone lines from the user's home. The
Pod is an optional accessory to IDEAL LIFE devices, including the
GlucoManager™, the BP-Manager™ and/or the Body Manager™. The Pod is
intended to aid people at home and health care professionals to review and
evaluate historical blood glucose, weight and blood pressure test results, to
support effective health care management.

I. Device Description:
The IDEAL LIFE Pod is used to upload the data stored in the memory of various
IDEAL LIFE devices to the IDEAL LIFE website via a common telephone line or via
the Internet. Two modes of transmission of data are possible: (1) via the telephone
line which connects to an RJ11 jack on the IDEAL LIFE Pod, or (2) via the Internet
through the Ethernet cable attached to the RJ45 jack on the IDEAL LIFE Pod.

User testing of the POD was conducted to determine:
1. If the POD and Gluco-Manager are easy to use and function as planned
when the user is provided only the instructions and materials that would be
available if a person were to purchase the devices; and

--- Page 7 ---
2. To verify that test data transmitted with (a) the POD connected via the
RJ-11 telephone jack, and (b) the POD connected via the RJ-45 Ethernet
cable are user friendly and provide the expected Gluco-Manager output on
the Internet.
The goal was to select subjects who have never used these devices, who
have varying educational levels, and who range in age from 18 to 70+
years. Twenty (20) subjects were enrolled in this study.
Inclusion Criteria:
1. Male and female patients aged 18 to 70+ years.
2. Subjects must be able to read English and must be physically able to
conduct the test by themselves.
3. Subjects must have some familiarity with computers, as the use of the
two devices with a computer and Internet-based system is central to
the study.
4. Subjects must agree to sign the Informed Consent document.
5. Subjects will not be paid for their participation in this study.
Exclusion Criteria:
1. Subjects who have used either of these IDEAL LIFE devices before
will be excluded from the trial.
Evaluation
Each Study Subject was provided with the following:
• One POD
• One Gluco-Manager
• One Ethernet cable
• One telephone cable
• Pod and Gluco-Manager Instruction Manuals
• Written Instructions
• Survey parts 1 and 2
Study Subjects were instructed to follow the Instruction Manual(s) to set
up the Gluco- Manager and Pod. The Instruction Manuals provide a toll-
free number to register the Pod and to receive a user name and password.
If the Study Subject asked questions of IDEAL LIFE staff at the time that
the toll-free telephone number is called for product registration, questions
will be allowed as this will be standard procedure during actual device
use.
Seven data sets are preloaded in the Gluco-Manager and the subjects
transmitted preloaded data using the Modem/RJ-11 jack setup and then
view their data on the Internet. After this process was completed, Part 2 of
7 of 10

--- Page 8 ---
the evaluation was completed to evaluate the usability of the devices and
the accuracy of the data transmitted. At the end of the user questions, the
subjects were directed to repeat this process using the Ethernet connection.
Subjects transmitted preloaded data using the Ethernet/RJ-45 jack setup
and then viewed their data on the Internet. After this process was
completed, Part 3 of the evaluation was completed to evaluate the usability
of the devices and the accuracy of the data transmitted.
Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the mean and standard
deviation of VAS scores, as well as the coefficient of variation
(SD/Mean). Comments of study subjects were analyzed to determine if
changes to the Instruction Manual or the device are required or would be
beneficial. A log of telephone calls and questions was maintained for the
same purpose. Adverse events, if any, were processed according to
IDEAL LIFE MDR Reporting Procedure 902P.
Applicant’s Analysis and Conclusions
The Pod is a "Plug-N-Play" device that is, by design, simple to set up and
to use. Validation and Verification testing conducted by IDEAL LIFE
engineers during development and prior to finalizing the software and
hardware design, including this Usability Test and one smaller previous
test. The user test was designed to test the usability of the Pod with the
Gluco-Manager for naive users, to reflect initial operation by a new
purchaser of the devices and identify potential design flaws in actual use
situations.
Average scores for all questions were below "2" on a scale of 1 to 10, 1
being the most favorable response. All open comments were positive.
In conclusion, the positive response to this user test and a previous
usability test indicates that there are no areas of concern about the
usability of the device by the intended users.

data from these devices is transmitted to the Pod, the Pod acts like a modem to
communicate through the user's telephone line cord (using the LINE connector,
