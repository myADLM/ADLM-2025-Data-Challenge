L. Test Principle:
Subsets of leukocytes can be distinguished on the basis of cell surface antigens using
fluorescent antibodies and flow cytometry. Qualitative and quantitative changes in
leukocyte subsets are used to identify and monitor immunodeficiency and

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The following two studies were performed using two different flow
cytometers:
The first study was to assess lymphocyte subset cell-surface markers obtained
from peripheral blood by collecting samples from 16 healthy donors in EDTA
and Cyto-Chex BCT tubes. Within 6 hours both tubes were analyzed on a
flow cytometer. Samples collected in Cyto-Chex BCT were held at room
temperature and also analyzed at 7 days, 11 days and 14 days. The following
markers were used for the analysis: CD3, CD4, CD8, CD16/56 and CD19.
Included in the collection data are Absolute cell counts values for each
lymphocyte subset as well as the % Recovery for each marker. All
correlations were referenced to the EDTA tube at 6 hours.

A second clinical study was to assess the stability of lymphocyte subsets in
specimen samples by collecting samples from 10 HIV positive donors and 10
normal donors stored in Cyto-Chex BCT tubes. They were analyzed with the
flow cytometer using single-platform methods at 6 hour, 7 days, 11 days and
14 days after collection. The following markers were used for the analysis:
CD3, CD4, CD8, CD16/56, CD19 and CD45. The number of lymphocytes
positive for the indicated marker was recorded for two runs at each time point.
The results were averaged for each donor. Regression analysis was used for
the relationship between the average measurement from each time point and
the control (EDTA 6 hours). The results showed the estimate slopes are close
to 1.0 and R2 values are all >0.97 indicating a good agreement between the
control and the Cyto-Chex BCT tubes.
