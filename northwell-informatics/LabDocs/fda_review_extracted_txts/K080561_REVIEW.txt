L. Test Principle:
The assay principle combines a 2-step enzyme immunoassay sandwich method with a final
fluorescent detection (ELFA).
The Solid Phase Receptacle (SPR®) serves as the solid phase as well as the pipetting device
for the assay. Reagents for the assay are ready-to-use and pre-dispensed in the sealed reagent
strips. All of the assay steps are performed automatically by the instrument. The reaction
medium is cycled in and out of the SPR several times. The sample is cycled in and out of the
SPR several times. This operation enables the monoclonal M11 antibody fixed onto the
interior wall of the SPR to capture the reactive antigenic determinants present in the sample.
Unbound components are eliminated during the washing steps. Alkaline phosphatase labeled
monoclonal OC 125 antibody (conjugate) is then incubated in the SPR where it binds with
the OC 125 reactive antigenic determinants. Unbound conjugate is then eliminated during
the washing steps. During the final detection step, the substrate (4-Methyl-umbelliferyl
phosphate) is cycled in and out of the SPR. The conjugate enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis
of this substrate into a fluorescent product (4-Methyl-umbelliferone) the fluorescence of
which is measured at 450 nm. The intensity of the fluorescence is proportional to the

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three serum samples were tested in duplicate in 40 different runs (2 runs per day over 20
sequential days) with 2 reagent lots using one instrument at each of three sites (N = 480).
The between-site precision, between-lot precision, between-recalibration precision,
between-day precision, between-run precision, repeatability (within-run precision) and
total precision (within-run, between-run, between-day, between-recalibration, between-
lot and between-site) were calculated using a modified (2 lots, 3 sites and 2 calibration
cycles within the 20 day period) protocol, which was based on the recommendations of

Total 480 5.85 5.20 5.03
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The VIDAS® CA 125 II kit linearity and recovery after dilution were studied
according to a protocol based on the recommendations of the document CLSI® EP06-
A [17].
Linearity range: two natural serum samples, one with a low concentration (5 U/mL)
and one with a high concentration (~700 U/mL), were mixed in varying proportions
distributed over the measurement range. Each dilution was tested in duplicate.
VIDAS CA 125 II was linear over the entire measurement range.
Dilution: Using the kit diluent, four patient samples (three > 600 U/mL and one close
to 50 U/mL) were diluted up to 1/20. Each dilution was tested in duplicate.
VIDAS CA 125 II assay was linear over the entire measurement range.
Hook Effect: Specimens were prepared by spiking serum with CA 125 antigen from
50 to 200,000 U/mL. The samples represented a large measurement range and four
were within the measurement range. The specimens were tested with two lots of

VIDAS CA 125 kits. No hook effect was observed for CA 125 concentrations up to
200,000 U/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability. Assay calibrators are traceable to working standards established by
bioMérieux with values assigned by Fujirebio Diagnostic Inc. radioimmunoassay
method.
Stability. Lyophilized calibrator and control stability is 12 months when stored at 2-
8ºC. Reconstituted calibrator and control stability is 2 weeks when stored at 2-8ºC or
7 months when stored at -25 ± 6ºC. The frozen calibrator was demonstrated to be
able to undergo up to five freeze/thaw cycles. One lot of control and calibrator was
tested. The acceptance criterion was target concentration plus 3 standard deviations.
Values of Calibrators and controls. The values for each kit lot are indicated on the
Master Lot Entry (MLE) card included in each kit lot.
d. Detection limit:
Limits of blank, detection, and quantitation were determined using 2 kit lots on 2
instruments (one per lot) using CLSI protocol EP17-A. Five low CA 125 samples
were tested using two lots on two VIDAS instruments. Tested CA 125 values ranged
from approximately 0.0 to 0.3 U/mL. Samples ranging from 0.2 to 0.3 U/mL were
used to estimate the limit of detection. Acceptance criteria for the limit of blank,
detection, and quantitation were described as follows:
• Limit of blank (LOB) – highest measurement result which has a 95%
probability to be observed for a blank sample. It is the 95th percentile of a
blank distribution
• Limit of detection (LOD) – lowest amount of analyte that can be detected
with 95% probability, though not quantified at an exact value.
• Limit of quantitation (LOQ) – lowest actual amount of analyte that can be
reliably detected and at which total error meets lab requirements for
accuracy.
The results are noted to support a claim for LOB, LOD and LOQ of less than 4 U/mL.
Therefore, the lowest value for the range of the assay is 4 U/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Hemoglobin, triglyceride, bilirubin, human albumin, rheumatoid factor, HAMA, and
27 drug interferents were evaluated for interference when added to a human serum
pool containing approximately 75.29 + 20.64 U/mL of CA 125.
Three samples, one of low CA125 concentration and two positive CA 125 (spiked
into a low sample) samples were prepared and split into 2 aliquots each. One aliquot
was spiked with hemoglobin, triglyceride, or bilirubin and the other with a
corresponding volume of buffer. Five intermediate CA 125 concentrations, derived
from the highest and lowest CA 125 concentrations, were prepared by mixing varying
amounts of the two aliquots. Hemoglobin concentrations ranged from 0 to 312
5

--- Page 6 ---
Umol/L. Triglyceride concentrations ranged from 0 to 30 g/L. Bilirubin
concentrations ranged from 0 to 513 Umol/L. Aliquots of each concentration were
tested in single replicates in 2 runs. The linear regression line coefficients were
calculated for the mean CA 125 concentration at each interfering substance
concentration. The hypothesis that the slope of the best fit line was zero was tested. If
the slope is not equivalent with 0 with a probability < 0.05 then there is interference
in the assay from the tested substance and testing must be repeated with lower
concentrations of interfering substance. As acceptance criteria, there must be no
effect from hemoglobin for concentrations less than 300 Umol/L, no effect from
triglycerides for concentrations less than 30 g/L, and no effect from bilirubin at
concentrations less than 364 Umol/L.
For hemoglobin concentrations ranging from 0 to 312 Umol/L, three different CA
125 concentrations were within the CA 125 specification range in the presence and
absence of hemoglobin. The 95% confidence intervals of the slope of the best fit line
of CA 125 concentration and hemoglobin concentration all included zero in the
confidence interval
For triglyceride concentrations ranging from 0 to 30 g/L, three different CA 125
concentrations were within the CA 125 specification range in the presence and
absence of triglyceride. Additionally, the 95% confidence intervals of the slope of the
best fit line of CA 125 concentration and triglyceride concentration all included zero
in the confidence interval with one exception.
For bilirubin concentrations ranging from <2 to 513 Umol/L, three different CA 125
concentrations were within the CA 125 specification range in the presence and
absence of bilirubin. Additionally, the 95% confidence intervals of the slope of the
best fit line of CA 125 concentration and bilirubin concentration all included zero in
the confidence interval Interference with human albumin, rheumatoid factor, and
human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) was evaluated at a separate site during
clinical study testing for precision. A modified variation of CLSI document EP7-A2
was used. The 3 interferents were added to a human serum pool containing known
CA 125 concentration (75.29 + 20.64 U/mL of CA 125.). The acceptance criterion
was no interference if the test sample (%recovery was within the range 90% to 110%
(i.e. ± 10% of 100% recovery). No interference was seen with human albumin or
HAMA, or rheumatoid factor at 100.5 IU/mL.
For human albumin and HAMA, no interfering effect was seen up to 150 mg/mL
albumin and up to 100.4 IU/mL HAMA. Interference was seen with RF at 2400
IU/ml. The limitations section of the labeling will reflect this interference.
Interference with various chemotherapeutic drugs was evaluated at a separate site
during clinical study testing for precision. A modified variation of CLSI document
EP7-A2 was used. Twenty-seven drug interferents were added to a human serum pool
containing a known CA 125 concentration (75.29 ± 20.64 U/mL of CA 125.) and
tested in three assay runs. The drugs tested represent drugs typically used in treatment
and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs.

--- Page 7 ---
The following drugs were tested:
Tested interfering drugs
5-fluorouracil Acetaminophen
N-acetyl-L-cysteine Acetylsalicylic acid
Ampicillin Ascorbic acid
Bleomycin Carboplatin
Cefoxitin Cisplatin
Cyclophosphamide Cyclosporine
Dactinomycin Doxicycline
Doxorubicin Etoposide
Ibuprofen Levodopa
Methotrexate Metronidazole
Mitomycin C Naprosyn
Paclitaxel Phenylbutazone
Rifampicin Vinblastine
Vincristine
The acceptance criterion is a ratio of test sample to control between 0.9 and 1.10.
No significant interference was noted for other tested drugs. All %recoveries were
between 0.9 and 1.1 with the exception of Cisplatin. Cisplatin showed no significant
interference at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL.
Cross-reactivity with beta-HCG, AFP, CEA, CA19-9, CA 15-3, Prostate-specific
antigen (PSA), was assessed using samples serving as calibrators in respective
TOSOH assays at its designated concentration. A human serum-based diluent served
as a blank. The samples and concentrations tested are:
• Beta-HCG - 206 mIU/mL
• AFP - 201 ng/mL
• CEA -49.6 ng/mL
• CA19-9 - 423 U/mL
• PSA - 52 ng/mL
• CA 15-3 (453.6 U/mL)
All samples gave no CA 125 value, which was the acceptance criterion for this
analysis.
f. Assay cut-off:
The sponsor defined a >10.25% percentage change in CA 125 values as significant.
This significant change is 2.5 times the total imprecision of the CA125 assay across
sites, lots, and concentration (expressed as %CV = 4.10%). The sponsor chose this
value to ensure that the change in CA 125 value is not attributed to assay variation.
To test this cutoff choice, 333 samples from 77 evaluable serial sets collected from
women with confirmed ovarian cancer were tested. The ethnic variation of the
evaluable women consisted of Caucasian (86%), Hispanic (10%), and Asian (4%).
The average age of women at the time of diagnosis was 56 years (median: 56.0 years,
SD = 14.1 years). The distribution of stage disease at time of diagnosis was
approximately; 10% at Stage I, 3% at Stage II, 67% at Stage III, and 20% at Stage IV.
Disease progression was determined by the subject’s physician based on any or a
composite of all of the following:
7

--- Page 8 ---
(1) Examination of the patient for clinical signs and symptoms, including the
results of laboratory tests that are current standard of care for the assessment
of ovarian cancer disease status.
(2) Examination of radiographic findings (imaging) ordered as standard of care
that can be used for the assessment of ovarian cancer disease status.
Radiographic findings include results from CAT scans, PET scans, MRI and
x-Ray images as well as Ultrasound.
(3) Interviews with the subjects as to how she felt and any symptoms she
experienced, how the subject felt compared to previous time intervals, etc.
An analysis of the choice of cutoff (as defined in terms of percent change between 2
successive Vidas CA125 II results) was performed using 256 evaluable visit pairs.
The percent change as cutoff is informative when the lower bound of the 95 %
confidence interval of the sum of positive and negative percent agreement exceeds
100%. Presented below is a table of several percent changes and their corresponding
Positive and Negative Percent Agreements from the analysis as examples of what
might be expected with using different criteria to assess change based on the CA125
II results.
Percent Change Positive Negative The Lower Bound of the 95% Confidence
Between Two Percent Percent Interval of the Sum of Positive and
Consecutive Agreement Agreement Negative Percent Agreement
Visits
>3.0% 70.65% 62.80% 121.6
>10.25% 70.65% 68.00% 126.7
>25.2% 67.39% 71.34% 127
>68.6% 55.43% 80.49% 123.9
As can be seen in the above table, the chosen cutoff of >10.25% is very near the
maximum lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the sum of positive and
negative percent agreement. This means that this cutoff gives very near to maximal
positive plus negative agreement.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Study Design. One serum sample randomly chosen from each of the 77 women with
ovarian cancer tested for the monitoring of the disease status (77 samples) and for the
expected values (133 samples) using the VIDAS® CA 125 II (Y) assay were
compared with another commercially available CA 125 II assay (X). The results
obtained are presented below (Deming). The equation represents the relationship
between the two techniques.

Range of samples: 4.0 – 31801 U/mL (VIDAS); 2.0 – 29940 U/mL (another
commercially available assay).
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable since only serum specimens are utilized.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
In a study of 77 subjects with at least 3 serum samples collected during the course of
follow-up surveillance for ovarian cancer progression, 333 visits were cross-tabulated
with a change in VIDAS CA 125 II concentration of ≥10.25% at each surveillance
visit. At each visit, any or a composite of physical signs/symptoms, results of lab
tests for colorectal cancer, radiographic findings (CAT scans, PET scans, MRI, x-ray,
or ultrasound), or patient reported symptoms were utilized by a physician to
determine disease status. Using a cut-off of >10.25% rise in CA125 II value, 70.65%
of subject visits (95% confidence interval 60.87% to 79.35%) had a rise in CA 125 II
value when the patient’s disease status was classified as progression. This value
represents the positive percent agreement of CA 125 II rise with a progression disease
status.
Using a cut-off of a >10.25% rise in CA125 II value, 67.68% of subject visits (95%
confidence interval 60.36% to 75.0%) had no rise in CA 125 II value when the
patient’s disease status was classified as no progression. The sponsor stated that this
value represents the negative percent agreement of CA 125 II rises with a progressive
disease status.
b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. is not applicable):
Samples utilized in this study were obtained from retrospective sample banks at M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center. Specimens for the study were from subjects with ovarian
cancer. Serial sets must include a minimum of 3 draws (4 draws or more desired) per
subject. Samples were blood draws performed at or after diagnosis throughout as
much of the clinical course as possible. Clinical information detailing the disease
status for each sample and information on types of therapy, if any, received with dates
of administration was collected. Three hundred and thirty-three (333) specimens from
77 subjects were collected. There were 256 evaluable observation pairs. The mean
number of serial specimens per subject was 4.32. Of the serial samples from 77
subjects, 31.2% of subjects had 3 visits, 32.5% had 4 visits, 20.8% had 5 visits,
10.4% had 6 visits, 3.9% had 8 visits and 1.3% had 9 visits. The mean age at
diagnosis was 56 years. Eighty-six percent of subjects were Caucasian, 4% Asian,
and 10% Hispanic. Approximately 88% were stage III and IV subjects. Stage I, and
II represented the remainder. Localized stage is stage I and II. Regional stage
corresponds to stage III, and distant stage corresponds to stage IV.
The outcome of interest was defined as progression of disease from time point i
(clinical visit i, i=1 to n-1) to a succeeding time point j (clinical visit j, j=i+1 to n).
The number of clinical visits for which samples and data are available is defined as n.
The visit number made by a study subject is at the time of diagnosis or after diagnosis
9

--- Page 10 ---
and prior to death, loss to follow-up or remission of disease. The sponsor statistically
defines w as a variable representing disease progression and has 2 values as follows:
ij
1 if there is disease progression from visit i to visit j
0 if no progression (stable disease, response to therapy) from visit i to visit j
Disease progression is determined by the subject’s physician and is based on any or a
composite of physical signs/symptoms, results of lab tests for colorectal cancer,
radiographic findings (CAT scans, PET scans, MRI, x-ray, or ultrasound), or patient
reported symptoms.
The sponsor defines the variable v as 1 if the difference in value of the test assay at
ij
visit i (x) and value of the test assay at a later visit j (x) is greater than or equal to
i j
12.2% (i.e. v = 1 if (x – x) ≥ 12.2%). The variable v is 0 if the difference is
ij j i ij
otherwise (i.e. v = 0 if (x – x) < 12.2%). The sponsor chose this value to ensure that
ij j i
the change in CA125 value is not attributed to assay variation and is statistically
significant. In the same way, the percentage change in the predicate device was
defined as 2.5 times the %CV of total imprecision as stated in the predicate package
insert. This value was 2.5 x 4% = 10% change.
To determine an association between the variables w (disease progression) and v
(change in CA 125 value) a 2 x 2 contingency table can be constructed to find an
association between variables. Items in each of the 4 cells represent pairs of v and w
(1 and/or 0) for visits for all subjects (or for subjects only). The total concordance
from the 2 x 2 contingency table (equivalent with total agreement), positive
concordance, and negative concordance can be calculated. In each situation, it is
assumed that agreement is with physician determined disease progression or no
progression. No specification for concordance values was present. A similar
definition and association will be sought for the predicate device for comparison
purposes.
The table and calculation of agreement values for the association of the proposed test
with disease state across all patient visits for all subjects is the following:
VIDAS CA 125 II Change in disease state (variable w) to
Change in CA 125 (variable v) Progression No progression Total
≥ 10.25% 65 53 118
< 10.25% 27 111 138
Total 92 164 256
Positive percent agreement measures the percent of visits when a percent change in
VIDAS CA 125 value exceeds >10.25% relative to same measurement at previous
visit and there is a corresponding patient disease status of progression at this visit.
The Positive percent agreement is 70.6% (65/92) with a 95% CI: 60.87% to 79.35%.
Negative percent agreement measures the percent of visits when a percent change in
VIDAS CA 125 value is less than 10.25% relative to the same measurement at
10

previous visit and there is a corresponding patient disease status of “No Progression”
(Responding or Stable) at this visit. The negative percent agreement is 67.68%
(111/164) with a 95% CI: 60.36% to 75.0%.
Similar data was available for the predicate device at the cutoff chosen using the same
criteria as for the VIDAS test.

Positive percent agreement measures the percent of visits when a percent change in
VIDAS CA 125 value exceeds 11.25% relative to same measurement at previous visit
and there is a corresponding patient disease status of progression at this visit. The
positive percent agreement is 67.4% (62/92) with a 95% CI: 59.0% to 76.0%.
Negative percent agreement measures the percent of visits when a percent change in
VIDAS CA 125 value is less than 11.25% relative to the same measurement at
previous visit and there is a corresponding patient disease status of No Progression
(Responding or Stable) at this visit. The Negative percent agreement is 65.2%
(107/164) with a 95% CI: 56.9% to 73.2%.
As can be seen, both the VIDAS test and the predicate obtained performance
characteristics compared to the reference clinical outcome that were substantially
equivalent (overlapping 95% confidence intervals.)
4. Clinical cut-off:
The sponsor defines a >10.25% percentage change in CA 125 II values as significant.
The significant change is 2.5 times the total imprecision of the CA 125 II assay across
sites, lots, and concentration (expressed as %CV = 4.10%). The sponsor chose this value
to ensure that the change in CA 125 II value is not attributed to assay variation.
An analysis of the choice of cutoff (as defined in terms of percent change between two
successive Vidas CA125 II results) was performed using the above-mentioned 256
evaluable visit pairs. The percent change as cutoff is informative when the lower bound
of the 95 % confidence interval of the sum of positive and negative percent agreement
exceeds 100%. Presented below is a table of several percent changes and their
corresponding Positive and Negative Percent Agreements from the analysis as examples
of what might be expected with using different criteria to assess change based on the
CA125 II results. Users may examine this table in the package insert to decide if they
prefer the VIDAS-recommended cutoff or another with different performance
characteristics.

Note from the table that at higher positive percent agreement there is lower negative
percent agreement. Note that the sponsor’s chosen cutoff of >10.25% is close to the
maximum lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the sum of positive and
negative agreement.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Estimation and empirical distributions of CA 125 II values in various populations of
subjects was performed. An apparently healthy population of 187 ambulatory females
aged 18-55 years of age, who were apparently healthy (by self report) and were not sick
on the day of serum sampling, were tested using the proposed CA 125 II assay. One
hundred thirty-one (131) were 50 years of age or younger, while the remaining 56 were
over age 50 and presumed to be post-menopausal. The results for these normal healthy
subjects were as follows:
Normal Number Percentage (%) of the population according to the range of 95th 95% CI
Healthy of values in U/mL percentile
