• for determination of the subtype of seasonal human influenza A virus, as
seasonal A/H1 or A/H3, if present, from viral RNA in nasopharyngeal and/or
nasal swab specimens,
• for presumptive identification of virus in patients who may be infected with
influenza A subtype A/H5 (Asian lineage) from viral RNA in human respiratory
specimens and viral culture in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk
factors.
• to provide epidemiologic information for surveillance for influenza viruses.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established when influenza A/H3 and
A/H1 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A
viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.
Testing with the influenza H5a and H5b primer and probe sets should not be performed
unless the patient meets the most current U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
(DHHS) clinical and epidemiologic criteria for testing suspect A/H5 specimens. The
definitive identification of influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) either directly from patient
specimens or from virus cultures requires additional laboratory testing, along with
clinical and epidemiological assessment in consultation with national influenza
surveillance experts.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the
sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
All users, analysts, and any person reporting diagnostic results from use of this device should be
trained to perform and interpret the results from this procedure by a CDC instructor or designee
prior to use. CDC Influenza Division will limit the distribution of this device to only those users
who have successfully completed training provided by CDC instructors or designees.

I. Device Description:
The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization
Panel (rRT-PCR Flu Panel) is a panel of oligonucleotide primers and dual-labeled
hydrolysis (TaqMan®) probes designed to be utilized in real-time RT-PCR assays
using the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument for detection and
characterization of human influenza viral RNA. The rRT-PCR Flu Panel influenza A
and B primer and probe sets target highly conserved regions of the matrix (M) and
non-structural (NS) genes for universal detection of type A and type B influenza
viruses. Influenza A subtyping primer and probe sets target highly conserved regions

of subtype-specific hemagglutinin (HA) RNA to detect contemporary A/H1, A/H3,
and A/H5 (Asian lineage) influenza viruses in humans.
The rRT-PCR Flu Panel also includes control materials.
• Internal positive control, the human RNase P (RP) primer and probe set detects
human RP and is used with each clinical specimen to indicate that adequate
isolation of nucleic acid resulted from the extraction of the specimen. A positive
RP assay result also ensures that common reagents and equipment are functioning
properly, and demonstrates the absence of inhibitory substances.
• A Human Specimen Control (HSC) is a noninfectious cultured human cell
material that demonstrates successful recovery of RNA as well as extraction
reagent integrity.
• The Seasonal Influenza Virus Control (SIVC) consists of three different influenza
viruses representing influenza A/H1, A/H3, and influenza B viruses and cultured
human cells. The SIVC demonstrates that the master mix and primer and probe
sets for influenza A (InfA), influenza B (InfB), influenza A/H1 (H1), influenza
A/H3 (H3), and RP are functioning properly.
• The Influenza Virus A/H5N1 Positive Control (H5VC) consists of a genetically
modified reassortant human influenza virus (Influenza A/Vietnam/1203/04 x
PR/8/34, BSL2 category) and cultured human cells. The H5VC demonstrates that
the master mix and primer and probe sets for InfA, influenza A/H5 (H5a, H5b),
and RP are functioning properly.
The use of the CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panel requires ancillary reagents for which specific lots
have been qualified by the CDC Influenza Division and incorporated in the CDC quality
system. Any lots not specifically qualified by CDC for use with the rRT-PCR Flu Panel are
not validated for use with this assay and may affect device performance. Lots which are
qualified under this process are communicated through a Qualified Reagent Lot List. This
list is maintained by CDC and made available to the end users of the CDC rRT-PCR Flu
Panel by including it with the Product Insert as well as through the Product Support
mechanism identified in the Product Insert.
The following is a list of ancillary reagents that are not supplied with the rRT-PCR
Flu Panel and are included in CDC’s reagent qualification program:

L. Test Principle:
The rRT-PCR Flu Panel includes a set of oligonucleotide primers and dual-labeled
hydrolysis (Taqman®) probes to be used in real-time RT-PCR assays on an ABI 7500
Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument. The targeted regions of viral RNA are
transcribed into complimentary DNA (cDNA) and amplified by the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). The fluorescently labeled probes anneal to amplified DNA fragments
and the fluorescent signal intensity is monitored by the ABI 7500 Fast Dx instrument
during each PCR cycle. Amplification of target is recorded as increase of
fluorescence over time in comparison to background signal.

If the assay controls do not exhibit the expected performance as described, the assay may
have been set up and/or executed improperly, or reagent or equipment malfunction could
have occurred. Invalidate the run and re-test.
Specimen Results and Interpretation
RNase P (Extraction Control)
All clinical samples should exhibit fluorescence growth curves in the RNase P reaction
that cross the threshold line within 37 cycles, thus indicating the presence of the human
RNase P gene. Failure to detect RNase P in any clinical specimens may indicate:
• Improper extraction of nucleic acid from clinical materials resulting in loss of RNA
and/or RNA degradation
• Absence of sufficient human cellular material due to poor collection or loss of
specimen integrity
• Improper assay set up and execution
• Reagent or equipment malfunction
If the RP assay does not produce a positive result for human clinical specimens, interpret
as follows:
• If the InfA, InfB, and/or any subtype reactions are positive even in the presence of a
negative RP, the influenza result should be considered valid. It is possible, that some
samples may fail to exhibit RNase P growth curves due to low cell numbers in the
original clinical sample. A negative RP signal does not preclude the presence of
influenza virus RNA in a clinical specimen.

• If all influenza markers AND RNase P are negative for the specimen, the assay is
“inconclusive” for the specimen. If residual specimen is available, repeat the
extraction procedure and repeat the test. If all markers remain negative after re-test,
report the results as “inconclusive” and a new specimen should be collected if
possible.
The RP assay may be negative when testing virus culture samples.
Influenza Markers (InfA, InfB, H1, H3, H5a, H5b)
When all controls exhibit the expected performance, a specimen is considered negative if
influenza marker growth curves DO NOT cross the threshold line within 37 cycles and
RNase P growth curve does cross the threshold line within 37 cycles.
When all controls exhibit the expected performance, a specimen is considered a
“Presumptive Positive” for influenza if the influenza marker (InfA, InfB, H1, H3, H5a,
and/or H5b) growth curve crosses the threshold line within 37 cycles. RP may be
positive or negative as described above.
When all controls exhibit the expected performance and the growth curve for influenza A
marker only crosses the threshold line within 37 cycles without any subtype detection
(InfA - Influenza A positive without a subtype detected), the sample has potential for
containing a novel and/or newly emerging influenza A virus. The extracted RNA from
the specimen should be re-tested. If residual RNA is not available, re-extract RNA from
residual specimen and re-test. If the re-tested sample is again positive for InfA only and
all controls exhibit the expected performance, contact the CDC Influenza Division to
coordinate transfer of the specimen to CDC for confirmatory testing.
When all controls exhibit the expected performance and none of the growth curves for the
influenza markers or RP marker cross the threshold line within 37 cycles, the result is
“Inconclusive”. The extracted RNA from the specimen should be re-tested. If residual
RNA is not available, re-extract RNA from residual specimen and re-test. If the re-tested
sample is negative for all markers and all controls exhibit the expected performance, the
result is “Inconclusive.”
When all controls exhibit expected performance and growth curves for both H5a and H5b
markers cross the threshold line within 37 cycles:
• Report the specimen to be “Presumptive Positive for Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage)
Virus” and contact the CDC Influenza Division immediately to coordinate transfer of
the specimen to CDC for additional testing.
When all controls exhibit the expected performance and growth curves for either H5a
and/or H5b markers cross the threshold line within 37 cycles, extracted RNA from the
specimen should be re-tested immediately. If residual RNA is not available, re-extract
RNA from residual specimen and re-test. If all controls exhibit the expected performance
on the repeated test and either H5a OR H5b reactions cross the threshold line within 37
cycles:

--- Page 9 ---
• Report the specimen to be “Inconclusive for Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) virus”
and contact the CDC Influenza Division immediately to coordinate transfer of the
specimen to CDC for additional testing.
When all controls exhibit the expected performance and any of the following occurs, the
test is “Invalid”:
• growth curves for influenza A marker and influenza B marker cross the threshold line
within 37 cycles, OR
• growth curves for influenza A marker and two or more of the influenza A subtype
markers cross the threshold line within 37 cycles, OR
• growth curves for any of the influenza A subtype markers (H1, H3, H5a, H5b) cross
the threshold line within 37 cycles but the growth curve for the influenza A type
marker (InfA) does not cross the threshold line within 37 cycles.
The extracted RNA from the specimen should be re-tested. If residual RNA is not
available, re-extract RNA from residual specimen and re-test. If the repeat testing results
remain the same as the original results, report the specimen as “Invalid.”
• If the InfA, InfB, and/or any subtype reactions are positive and RP is negative, the
influenza result should be considered valid.
• If a combination of results other than those in the chart is generated, the result is
invalid. Repeat extraction and retest the sample. If repeat testing result is
unchanged, report as “Invalid” result.
To refer the specimen to the CDC, the following shipping instructions should be
followed:
• Ship all specimens and related RNA overnight to CDC.
• Ship frozen specimens on dry ice and non-frozen specimens on cold packs. Ship
extracted RNA on dry ice.
• Refer to the International Air Transport Association (IATA - www.iata.org) for
requirements for shipment of human or potentially infectious biological
specimens.
• Prior to shipping, notify the CDC Influenza Division (see contact information
below) that you are sending specimens.
• Send all samples to the following recipient:

--- Page 10 ---
The rRT-PCR Flu Panel reproducibility and precision studies were performed to
1) evaluate reproducibility of the assay at three laboratory sites using the ABI
7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instruments and SDS software version 1.4 and 2) to
compare the assay performance on the original ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR
instrument and the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument (bridging
study).
1) The ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument functionality was validated
at each site by AB prior to the reproducibility assessment using a panel of nine (9)
simulated samples including influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, A/H5N1 (reassortant),
and Influenza B at two viral RNA concentrations each (a low viral RNA
concentration and a 1:10 dilution of the same sample). The low viral RNA
concentration generally was one log above the assay cutoff for all analytes,
whereas the 1:10 dilution of the same sample approximated a sample at the assay
cutoff. Simulated samples in the panel used in the reproducibility evaluation
were:
• Sample #1 Influenza A/H1N1 at a low viral RNA titer range
• Sample #2 Influenza A/H1N1 at a 1:10 dilution of sample #1
• Sample #3 Influenza A/H3N2 at a low viral RNA titer range
• Sample #4 Influenza A/H3N2 at a 1:10 dilution of sample #3
• Sample #5 Influenza A/H5N1 WT at a low viral RNA titer range
• Sample #6 Influenza A/H5N1 WT at a 1:10 dilution of sample #5
• Sample #7 Influenza B Yamagata at a low viral RNA titer range
• Sample #8 Influenza B Yamagata at a 1:10 dilution of sample #7
• Sample #9 Influenza Negative (uninfected A549 cells)
The panels and assay controls were tested at each site by two operators on five (5)
different days within a 10-day period. Each participating clinical site tested one
of the four following RNA purification methods to evaluate reproducibility of the
CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panel on the validated ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR
instruments: the automated MagNA Pure LC RNA Isolation Kit III (Roche
Applied Science), the manual QIAGEN RNeasy® RNA extraction (QIAGEN
Ltd.), the Roche MagNA Pure LC Automated Isolation System with Total RNA
isolation method, and the QIAGEN QIAamp® Viral RNA manual extraction
method. The manufacturer’s instructions for use provided in the package insert
were followed. Results generated for each of the extraction methods are
summarized in the Table below.

2) Assay performance, when run on the original ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR
instrument and the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument, was compared
utilizing an identical study protocol to that described in paragraph 1) above and
using simulated samples for influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, A/H5N1 (reassortant),
and Influenza B at a low viral RNA concentration, (generally one log above the
assay cutoff). Although several panel members displayed, on average,
statistically significant higher Ct values in the reproducibility study on the ABI
7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument as compared to the original
reproducibility study run on the ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR instrument, all
values were within clinically acceptable levels. The difference could be attributed
to different operators and panel reagent lot-to-lot variability.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable, qualitative assay
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Before analyzing the samples prepared using the CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panel on the
ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument, the ABI instrument must be
prepared following the procedures described in the Package Insert for the CDC
Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization Panel
and the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument User Manual.
Assay Controls
Quality Control requirements must be performed in conformance with local, state,
and/or federal regulations or accreditation requirements and a laboratory’s
standard quality control procedures. It is recommended that the user refer to
CLSI document C24-A2.
No Template Control (NTC)
The NTC consists of using nuclease-free water in the rRT-PCR reactions instead
of RNA. The NTC reactions for all primer and probe sets should not exhibit
fluorescence growth curves that cross the threshold line. If any of the NTC
reactions exhibit a growth curve that crosses the cycle threshold, sample

contamination may have occurred. Invalidate the run and repeat the assay with
stricter adherence to the guidelines.
Seasonal Influenza Virus Control (SIVC)
The SIVC consists of three different influenza viruses representing influenza
A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and influenza B and cultured human cells (A549). Purified
RNA from the SIVC will yield a positive result with the following primer and
probe sets: InfA, H1, H3, InfB, and RP.
H5 Virus Control (H5VC)
The H5VC control consists of a reassortant human vaccine candidate virus
(A/Vietnam/1203/04 x PR/8/34) that was generated by reverse genetics and
cultured human cell (A549) material. Purified RNA from the H5VC will yield a
positive result with the following primer and probe sets: InfA, H5a, H5b, and RP.
Human Specimen Control (HSC) (Extraction)
The HSC control consists of noninfectious cultured human cell (A549) material.
The HSC is used as a RNA extraction procedural control to demonstrate
successful recovery of RNA as well as extraction reagent integrity. Purified RNA
from the HSC should yield a positive result with the RP primer and probe set and
negative results with all influenza specific markers
A negative amplification/detection control (NTC) and a positive control (SIVC
and/or H5VC) should be included in each run. An HSC extraction control must
proceed through nucleic acid isolation for each batch of specimens to be tested.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined for each primer and probe set in
the rRT-PCR Flu Panel. Ten-fold serial dilutions of two different influenza virus
strains of each subtype were tested to identify an end-point for detection. RNA
was extracted from each of the characterized viruses with the Qiagen QIAamp®
Viral RNA Purification kit. The LoD for each primer and probe set (InfA, InfB,
H1, H3, H5a, and H5b) was calculated to determine the lowest detectable
concentration range of influenza virus (EID /mL) at which approximately 95% of
50
all replicates tested positive. The lowest concentration of influenza virus detected
was determined to be the end-point concentration where the type and subtype
primer and probe sets had uniform detection. If the two end-points differed in
concentration, the higher (or limiting) point was used.

e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity of rRT-PCR Flu Panel was evaluated with respect to 1)
reactivity (inclusivity) with a number of geographically diverse influenza virus
strains and 2) potential cross-reactivity with non-influenza pathogens associated
with respiratory tract infections.
1) Reactivity/Inclusivity
Ten (10) influenza virus strains of A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and Influenza B were tested
at low virus concentrations at or near the limit of detection (102 TCID /mL) to
50
demonstrate the flexibility of the primer and probe sets to detect multiple strains
of influenza virus. There were 26 influenza A/H5N1 strains tested retrospectively
from diverse geographic locations from suspect positive cases received at CDC.
The rRT-PCR Flu Panel analytical specificity indicated 100% concordance with
expected results for all primer and probe sets included in the device.

Cross-Reactivity Evaluation
Analytical specificity (cross-reactivity) was evaluated by testing each primer/probe set
within the device panel with nucleic acids extracted from 27 organisms (9 viruses, 17
bacteria, and 1 yeast) representing common respiratory pathogens or flora commonly
present in specimens collected from the nasopharynx region. All the organisms were
propagated, titered, and characterized to confirm identity prior to testing. The identity of
the commensal respiratory bacteria was confirmed by 16S ribosomal RNA bi-directional
sequencing. The identity of the non-influenza respiratory viruses was confirmed by bi-
directional sequencing. Bacteria and yeast were tested at concentrations greater than or
equal to106 cfu/mL. Non-influenza respiratory viruses were tested at concentrations
greater than 106 TCID /mL with the exception of human parainfluenza type 2 which was
50
tested at 103.1 TCID /mL due to difficulty generating a high titer virus stock in culture
50
and coronaviruses CoV 229E and CoV OC43 (31.6 ng/μl and 50.4 ng/μl, respectively, of
total RNA from viral culture).
Each sample (bacteria and virus) was extracted in parallel using both the Qiagen
QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini Kit and the Qiagen RNeasy® Mini Kit. Each RNA sample
was tested following the testing procedure previously described for the rRT-PCR Flu
Panel and the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System. The dual
extraction method was performed to demonstrate cross method equivalency and ensure
no cross reactivity with the influenza primer and probe sets since negative results were
expected for all samples.

1 Organism quantitated by spectrophotometry (ng/μl)
The study demonstrated that the primer and probe sets contained within the rRT-
PCR Flu Panel did not cross-react with any of the non-influenza respiratory
pathogens or commensal organisms tested. The data demonstrated 100%
concordance with the expected results.
f. Assay cut-off:
To assess the rRT-PCR Flu Panel assay cut-off, the data from the limit of
detection study was analyzed. Data were plotted as virus concentration (log
TCID ) versus cycle threshold (Ct) value at or below the limits of detection (in
50
yellow) for each marker (e.g. Figure 18-1). The average Ct value at the lower end
of the range of the limit of detection plus two standards of deviation afforded the
Ct value cut-off for each of the markers in the rRT-PCR Flu Panel assay as shown
by the red line (InfA = 37; InfB = 35; H1 = 35; H3 = 36; H5a = 35; H5b = 35).
Particularly in the case of the InfA target (Figure 18-1); marked differences in
detection between subtypes of influenza A are apparent. As the assay is designed
for both seasonal and pandemic use, it is vital to detect any and all strains of
influenza as the assay may detect novel influenza A strains. Therefore, the cut-off
Ct value for the rRT-PCR assay was set at 37.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable, performance of the assay was evaluated in comparison to the gold
standard/reference method, viral culture followed by DFA and/or sequencing
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable
3. Clinical studies:
Performance characteristics of the rRT-PCR Flu Panel were established during a
prospective study at 4 U.S. state public health laboratories during the 2006-2007
respiratory virus season (February-April). A total of 439 (415 prospective
seasonal specimens collected for routine influenza testing and 24 retrospective
AH5 influenza samples) from nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs, or grown in
culture in the case of influenza AH5 samples were used for this study.
The reference method was rapid culture (shell vial) followed by direct fluorescent
antibody screening and identification. Specimens tested at the public health
testing sites followed routine diagnostic influenza rapid culture protocols and the
rRT-PCR Flu Panel protocol to demonstrate performance of the assay. Influenza
AH5 and discrepant prospective seasonal influenza samples were further analyzed

Due to the absence of suspect cases within the United States, a formal prospective
clinical evaluation of human and/or avian influenza A/H5N1 virus was not
accomplished during the CDC Clinical Evaluation Study. Therefore, the
performance specificity and detection capability of the H5a and H5b primer and
probe sets in the rRT-PCR Flu Panel could not be evaluated at the U.S. state
public health laboratories during the clinical study. Retrospective data from
twenty–four (24) suspect A/H5N1 positive specimens from human cases received
by the CDC Influenza Division were used to demonstrate clinical performance of
the H5a and H5b components of the panel.

(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtmlml/mm5631a2.htm). In the rRT-
PCR Flu Panel multi-center prospective clinical study during the 2006-2007
influenza season, the prevalence as determined by virus culture was as follows:
influenza A/H1 (7.0%), influenza A/H3 (23.6%), and influenza B (9.9%). No
dual infections were found in this study. It is recommended that any sample that
tests positive for more than one influenza virus be re-tested.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
