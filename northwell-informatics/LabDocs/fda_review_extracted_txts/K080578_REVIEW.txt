L. Test Principle:
The PBNP method is a one-step sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based on
LOCI® technology. LOCI® reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and a
biotinylated monoclonal antibody fragment which recognize an epitope located in the
N-terminal part of proBNP. The first bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with
streptavidin and contains photosensitive dye. The second bead reagent (Chemibeads)
is coated with a second antibody specific for a second independent epitope on NT-
proBNP and contains chemiluminescent dye. Sample is incubated with Chemibeads
and biotinylated antibody to form a particle/NT-proBNP/biotinylated antibody
sandwich. Sensibeads then are added and bind to the biotin to form a bead-aggregated
immunocomplex. Illumination of the complex by light at 680 nm generates singlet

oxygen from Sensibeads, which diffuses to the Chemibeads and triggers a
chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting chemiluminescent signal is measured at 612
nm and is directly proportional to the concentration of NT-proBNP in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Testing was conducted in accordance with CLSI EP5-A2. During each day of
testing, two separate runs, with two test samples, for each test material, were
analyzed for 20 days. The results are summarized in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
CLSI EP6-A Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement
Procedures was followed. De-identified high and low concentration serum
samples were mixed to cover 5 equally spaced expected levels across the
assay range. A sample with a value of 41,812 pg/mL was diluted for the full
range linearity study and a sample with a value of 1266 pg/mL was diluted for
the low range linearity study. The samples were diluted with low level patient
plasma pools. The studies support the analytical measuring range for the assay
of 5 – 35,000 pg/mL. The following table summarizes the results of the
studies:

Hook effect was evaluated using a high concentration PBNP sample. The
sample was diluted at 1:10, 1:20, 1:40 and 1:80. The neat and diluted samples
were tested. The data demonstrated that the Dimension Vista® PBNP method
showed no hook effect up to 400,000 pg/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The design and function of the Dimension Vista® PBNP-Calibrator is
equivalent to that of the previously cleared Dimension Vista® PBNP-
Calibrator (k061795).
The artificial matrix for the calibrator is BSA based spiked with synthetic NT-
proBNP peptide. The master pool is a multi-level, liquid BSA-based artificial
matrix spiked with synthetic NT-proBNP peptide stored at -70°C.

from the patient sample anchor pool, which has been assigned on the Elecsys
PBNP assay.

Opened product – Punctured vials are stable for seven days, when stored on
board the Dimension Vista® System. Once cap is removed, the product is
stable for 30 days when stored securely capped at 2 – 8 degrees Celsius.
d. Detection limit:
The estimation of the Limit of Blank (LoB) was performed by running twenty
replicas of the PBNP Calibrator, level A, calculating the mean and adding 2
standard deviations to the mean. CLSI EP17-A, Protocols for Determination
of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation, was followed. The Limit of
Blank was estimated to be 0.2 pg/mL.
To determine the Limit of Detection (LoD), five samples of PBNP Calibrator
Level A and five low patient samples were tested on four different days, using
two different instruments and two different reagent lots. A total N=60 blank
samples and N=60 low-level samples were tested. One trained operator
performed the testing. The calculation of the Limit of Detection was
performed by the following formula:
LoD = LoB + (cp)x(sd)
LoD = 0.2 pg/mL + (1.646) x (0.4) = 0.8 pg/mL
The nonparametric approach described in EP17-A was followed to determine
the Limit of Detection with proportions of false positives (α) less than 5% and
false negatives (β) less than 5%; based on 60 determinations, with 5 blank and
5 low level samples. The LoD was estimated to be 0.8 pg/mL. The analytical
measuring range for the assay is from 5 – 35,000 pg/mL.
Limit of quantitation was evaluated by determining the total imprecision of
natural NT-proBNP serum samples. Total imprecision was measured by a two
replicate per day, twenty day ANOVA study. The intra-assay imprecision
profile for the Dimension Vista® PBNP method corresponds to a coefficient
of variation (CV) of 20% at an NT-proBNP level of ≤30 pg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
No significant interference was found for bilirubin (conjugated) up to 60
mg/dL, bilirubin (unconjugated) up to 60 mg/dL, hemoglobin up to 1000
mg/dL, and triglycerides up to 3000 mg/dL. An extensive list of other
compounds was evaluated for interference when added to samples with NT-
proBNP concentrations of 135 and 2000 pg/mL and was found to have no
significant interference (<10%). A list of these compounds is presented in the
labeling.
