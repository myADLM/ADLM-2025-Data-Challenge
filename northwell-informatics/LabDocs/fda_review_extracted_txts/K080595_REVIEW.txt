510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
K080595
B. Purpose for Submission:
Expanded intended use
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
CellaVision AB, CellaVision DM 96 with the body fluid application
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
White Blood Cells (differential), RBC characterization and Platelet estimation
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
CellaVision DM96 consist as of a slide feeder unit, an optical unit consisting
of a microscope and camera (referred to as a slide scanning unit), a computer
system contains the acquisition and classification software CellaVision DM
software.
CellaVision DM96 with the body fluid application is substantially equivalent
to the DM96 for peripheral blood regarding technology and functionality. The
intended use of the body fluid application is substantially equivalent to the
Romanowsky stain manual light microscopic method of cell classification.
The body fluid application functionality:
• Presents an image on a screen of every located cell or object
• Organizes and suggests cell classification (reclassification) for the
located blood cells
• Makes it possible to identify, confirm or modify (reclassification) the
suggested classification of the located cells
2. Principles of Operation:
Twelve slides can be loaded into each magazine. The magazine used for the body
fluid application is identified through the color and the barcode on it.

--- Page 2 ---
The magazines are put onto a conveyer belt and are automatically transported to
the slide scanning unit. The analysis process consists of an overview image
processing and a cell-location step. The body fluid overview image displays the
entire sample area. The overview image can be used to find cells of interest and
for getting an overall impression of the sample. The overview image can either
have one 10x zoom level or both 10x and 50x zoom levels. The cell-location step
uses the optical unit and a camera taking images of the identified images and
stores the images of the located cells and the results in a database, and displays
the images in an organized manner.
3. Modes of Operation:
The DM96 is an automated cell-locating device. The system also has Remote
Review Station capability with network access to the main DM96 device.
4. Specimen Identification:
Glass microscope slides are labeled with barcodes. Twelve slides fit into a
barcoded labeled magazine.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Body fluid is cytocentrifuged and stained outside the device on standard
rectangular glass slides by standardized stained with Romanowsky stain.
6. Calibration:
Not applicable.
7. Quality Control:
The system performs self-tests during startup of the software, and at certain points
during the operation of the system. Both hardware and software components are
tested. The Cell location test is used to verify the slide preparation process and the
system hardware. Running the test once or twice a day is a recommended interval
at the high-load laboratory.
8. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and Software Development
processes for this line of product types:

G. Intended Use:
1. Indication(s) for Use:
DM96 is an automated cell-locating device.
The body fluid application is intended for differential count of white blood cells.
The system automatically locates and presents images of cells on cytocentrifuged
body fluid preparations. The operator identifies and verifies the suggested
classification of each cell according to type.
DM96 is intended to be used by skilled operators, trained in the use of the device
and in recognition of blood cells.

a. Accuracy:
A mixture of 156 samples (89 CSF and 69 BF) was identified according to
EP9A-2 from two sites. All samples were initially analyzed on a cell counter
or counted in a hemocytometer to get the leukocyte concentration. From each
sample two cytocentrifuged smears were prepared. 200-cell differential counts
were performed (400 cells/sample) with both methods and analyzed. The
same examiners analyzed the same slides. The accuracy was tested through
scatter-plots for each cell class.
