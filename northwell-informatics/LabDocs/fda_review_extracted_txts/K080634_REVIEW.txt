coated with anti-sTfR antibody. During incubation, the sTfR antigen in the sample
binds to the immobilized anti-sTfR antibody molecule on the solid phase. Alkaline
phosphatase conjugated anti-sTfR antibody is then added and reacts with a different
antigenic site on the sTfR molecule. After incubation in a reaction vessel, materials
bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are
washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phos 530 is added to the
vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light
production is directly proportional to the concentration of sTfR in the sample. The
amount of analyte in the sample is determined from a stored, multi-point calibration
curve.
The calculation of the sTfR/log ferritin index is as follows where log refers to base-10
log and not to natural log:
sTfR (nmol/L) ÷ log ferritin ng/mL
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
(1) Precision of the sTfR assay was evaluated using 6 samples (pooled serum)
in duplicate for 20 days, 2 runs per day on one Access 2 instrument. The
mean of the replicates, standard deviation, and the %CV for within run
and total precision were determined by analysis of variance. The
acceptance criteria for total precision for sTfR levels > 9 nmol/L are %CV
≤ 8% and for levels ≤ 9 nmol/L are SD ≤1.00. The results of precision
studies on 3 lots are presented below. Samples 3, 4, 5, and 6 were
additionally spiked, and Samples 1 and 2 were diluted to achieve the
desired concentrations.

(2) Lot-to-Lot reproducibility was determined using 5 samples, 3 Access TfR
controls (range 8.45 nmol/L to 132.60 nmol/L) and 3 lots. The %CV for
this range was less than 3.76%.

(4) sTfR/log ferritin index precision: The sTfR precision data from one lot
(excluding Sample 1 which is below the claimed measuring range of the
assay) were assayed using both the Access sTfR and Access Ferritin
assays. The same methods and statistical analysis used for the sTfR
precision study were used. The sTfR/log ferritin index was determined for
all replicates with sTfR and Ferritin values. Within run precision for the
sTfR /log ferritin index (index range 6.19 to 69.27) was less than 3% CV
and the Total precision observed was less than 6%CV. Precision results
for the Ferritin assay and sTfR/log ferritin assay are shown below
(precision results for the sTfR assay are from Pilot 3 shown above).
(5) Precision of plasma samples: Four plasma samples were spiked or diluted to
span to range from ~3 nmol/L to 100 nmol/L and run in replicates of 5 for 5
days. The within-run precision was < 1.7 %CV and the total imprecision was
<2.2% CV.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Dilution Recovery: Six serum and six plasma samples were spiked with
known concentrations representing the middle and upper portions of the sTfR
assay’s analytical range. At least 6 serial dilutions were prepared for each of
these samples using the zero calibrator or wash buffer II as the diluent. The %
Recovery was calculated as (Observed value/Expected value) x100. The
Observed value represented the means of 4 replicates and the neat samples
were replicates of 8. The results are summarized for serum and for plasma.

An additional analysis of the dilution recovery was also performed using the
methods outlined in CLSI EP6-A: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative
Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline. In
this analysis, both linear and quadratic models were fit to the log transformed
dilution data. For all sample dilutions, the % difference observed between the
two models was less than 10%.
Spike Recovery: Test samples were prepared by adding sTfR into 6 serum and
6 plasma samples to obtain a final sTfR concentration of ~120nmol/L. Each
high patient sample was then spiked into a low sample (~12nmol/L) to obtain
samples consisting of 75%, 50%, and 25% of high sample. Four replicates
were used to calculate the Average Observed Dose for each sample.
%Recovery = (Average Observed Dose/Expected Dose) x 100. Mean
recovery was between 96 and 104% in serum samples and between 97 and
114% in plasma samples.
c. Traceability and value assignment calibrator and controls: Traceability to a
highly characterized master lot (referred to as primary reference calibrator)
prepared by contract manufacturer designated Lot N016 from normal human
plasma and assigned values using a process based on International Standard
EN ISO 17511:2003, Metrological Traceability of Values Assigned to
Calibrator and Control Materials.
Stability: Stability data for the test reagent pack and calibrator was supplied
for both open and closed stability. The data supported the claim of 28 days
for open stability (acceptance criteria ±10%) and current shelf life up. Studies
are ongoing to support a claim of 12 months. Stability studies for controls
support claims and storage conditions (open 90 days; 6 freeze/thaw cycles).

d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB): The Access sTfR zero (S0) calibrator was determined
with a non-parametric estimate of the 95% percentile of 120 replicates, run in
6 runs of 20 replicates over 3 days. The LoB for the Access sTfR assay was
determined to be 0.01 nmol/L.
Limit of Detection (LoD): Three serum and three plasma samples were treated
to remove sTfR in the samples. In total, 20 replicates (2 runs of 10 replicates
per sample) of each of the 6 samples (60 measurements per matrix) were
measured. The LoD was determined to be 0.02 nmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference: To evaluate potential interference, substances listed below were
spiked individually into normal human serum and compared to the control
sample (~ sTfR concentration 33nmol/L). The mean % interference was
calculated as follows (mean observed value/mean expected value) x100.
Means were calculated from 10 replicate measurements. The acceptance
criteria of 100 ± 10% were met.

Interference by rheumatoid factor (RF) was evaluated using 10 serum samples
positive for RF ranging from (284 to 872 IU/mL) in replicates of 4.
Interference by RF was not detected in a low sTfR (~18 nmol/L) serum
sample.
Cross-reactivity: Potential cross-reactants with sTfR were spiked individually
into pooled human serum with sTfR ~ 35 nmol/L. The percent cross-
reactivity was calculated as follows [(mean test value – mean control
value)/cross reactant added (mg/mL)] x 100. The results are presented below
and met design specifications of ≤ 0.5% cross-reactivity. Conversion factor: 1
nmol/L sTfR = 7.4 x 10-5 mg/mL sTfR. (% Interference 113% for
Diferric(holo) transferring and less 2.6% for the remaining substances).
Hook Effect: A patient serum pool was spiked with recombinant sTfR to a
concentration of ~6000 nmol/L (40 times the highest calibrator). The sample
was then diluted in a 1:2 series to 6 nmol/L. All dilutions were assayed in
duplicate. No Hook effect was seen to 6000 nmol/L.
f. Assay cut-off:
See Clinical studies below.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
(1) A correlation study was performed comparing the Access sTfR assay to a
predicate device, the R&D Systems Quantikine IVDs TfR ELISA. A total
of 125 samples (73 pooled serum samples, 30 native serum samples, 13
spiked to cover the high end of the range, and 9 diluted native samples to

(2) An additional method comparison study was performed to compare the
Access IMMUNOASSAY SYSTEMS sTfR Assay to the predicate R&D
Systems Quantikine sTfR Assay. A total of 271 clinical samples from 5
geographically distinct sites were included in this analysis; sTfR and
Ferritin concentrations for each sample were measured once on 1 lot of
reagent for the Access 2 instrument and compared to the mean of 2 sTfR
measurements on 1 lot of reagent for the reference ELISA assay. Passing-
Bablock regression analysis was performed to determine the slope and
intercept and Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) was calculated. The
results are shown below.

Access Platforms Equivalence: To verify the equivalence of the Access
platform family members with respect to the Access sTfR assay, method
comparison, bias, and precision studies were performed. Representative
platforms from the Access family of instruments were evaluated in paired
comparisons using 8 samples that span the range of the assay 3 to 150 nmol/L.
The acceptance criteria between the instruments require that the 95%
confidence interval be within ±12% for method comparison and bias, and
±10% for precision. Acceptance criteria were met. Data contained in this
submission were collected using the Access, Access 2 and UniCel DxI 800
Analyzers.
b. Matrix comparison:
(1) A matrix comparison study was performed using 20 matched serum (in
both plain (Red Top) and gel (SST) tubes, and plasma (heparin) samples
(sTfR range 11 to 48 nmol/L). Each set was spiked with sTfR to one of
five approximate concentrations (40, 60, 80, 100, or 120 nmol/L). For
each matched sample set, testing was performed on neat samples (n=20)
and the spiked samples (n=20) for a total of 40 matched sample sets. The
results are shown below (n =40, range ~10 to 130 nmol/L):

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
Background: Anemia of Chronic Disease (ACD) and iron deficiency anemia
(IDA) are the most common forms of anemia, differentiated primarily by
estimates of iron status. IDA is a condition that occurs when there is not
enough iron in the body. A lack of iron in the body can come from blood loss,
poor dietary intake, poor iron absorption, or when the body’s need for iron is
elevated, such as during pregnancy. When the body has sufficient iron to
meet its needs (functional iron), the remainder is stored for later use in the
bone marrow, liver, and spleen. ACD is a condition of impaired iron
utilization. ACD is seen in a wide range of chronic malignant, autoimmune,
leukemic, inflammatory, and infectious disease conditions. In some disease
conditions, the two conditions co-exist (IDA+ACD).
Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR): Transferrin receptor (TfR) is the major
mediator of iron uptake by cells. When a cell needs iron, TfR expression is
increased. Since the major use of iron is for hemoglobin synthesis, about 80%
of total TfR is on erythroid progenitor cells. The sTfR arises from the
extracellular proteolysis of TfR and can be measured in serum or plasma. A
constant relationship exists between sTfR and TfR. The sTfR is increased in
iron deficiency reflecting the cellular need for iron. The sTfR is elevated in
iron deficiency but is not appreciably affected by chronic disease,
Serum Ferritin measurements aid in identifying conditions causing iron
overload and iron deficiency anemia. Ferritin decreases in IDA patients, but
increases in conditions associated with chronic inflammatory diseases.
However, patients with anemia may have a falsely increased ferritin
concentration as an acute phase reactant due to inflammation. Therefore, one

Lot 2	0.94			0.17			0.98			0.98			0.38			0.99

of the main difficulties encountered in the laboratory diagnosis of anemia is
distinguishing IDA from ACD, especially when both disorders are
concurrently present.
sTfR/log ferritin index: Because sTfR reflects the degree of tissue iron supply,
and ferritin reflects stored iron levels, it has been demonstrated that the
sTfR/log ferritin ratios (Index) is a good estimate of body iron. The index
takes advantage of two variables influenced by iron deficiency: an increase in
sTfR and a decrease in the ferritin concentration.
Clinical Study: To assess the clinical performance of the Access
IMMUNOASSAY SYSTEMS sTfR assay and the sTfR/log ferritin index, two
clinical utility trials were conducted. A retrospective clinical study was first
performed to verify studies in the literature demonstrating efficacy of the sTfR
and sTfR/log ferritin index and to identify cut-offs. Next, a prospective
multicenter clinical trial was designed based on the results of the first trial. In
this study, 145 patients from 4 geographically distinct regions were
prospectively enrolled based on pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Anemia was detected and quantified by measurement of the RBC count,
hemoglobin concentration, and hematocrit. All subjects had low hemoglobin
levels. Subjects were classified into one of three categories of anemia: ACD
(n = 57), IDA (n = 27), or ACD + IDA (n = 61) based on the current standard
of care for diagnosis of anemia (low hemoglobin) and for classification of
anemia, which included standardized testing and clinical evaluation.
Standardized testing included Complete Blood Count (CBC) and differentials,
iron profile (serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC) or transferrin,
transferrin saturation), serum ferritin, CRP and cytometric classification (e.g.,
hypochromic microcytic vs. normochromic normocytic). All patients with
elevated CRP values (≥ 10 mg/L) or WBC (≥10.5 x 103/μl) were classified as
having chronic inflammation or infection.
To assess the clinical performance of the sTfR, a series of potential cutoffs
were assessed using 2x2 tables and Fisher’s Exact tests. Sensitivity is this
clinical trial is defined as the percentage of patients with IDA or IDA+ACD
correctly identified. Specificity is defined as the percentage of patients with
ACD (without accompanying IDA) correctly identified. The sensitivity and
specificity results for sTfR are shown below. A cutoff of 21nmol/L for sTfR,
is recommended by Sponsor.
The sTfR assay is not intended to be used in isolation; results should be
interpreted in conjunction with other diagnostic tests and the patient’s clinical
presentation.

Race/Ethnicity: An analysis of trial data by race showed no statistically
significant differences between blacks (19/125 subjects) and non blacks or for
Hispanic/Latino (34/186 subjects) vs. non-Hispanic/Latino for the sTfR or the
sTfR/log ferritin index.
Demographics: A subanalysis of the four geographically diverse sites used to
enroll subjects for the study (Kansas, Arizona, California, and Finland)
indicated that the sTfR or the sTfR/log ferritin index did not vary by site.
