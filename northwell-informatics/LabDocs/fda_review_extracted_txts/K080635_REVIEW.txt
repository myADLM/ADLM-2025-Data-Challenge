--- Page 3 ---
(GC/MS) or liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should
be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results
are obtained.
The MEDTOXScan® Reader includes a Positive QC Test Device, a Negative QC Test
Device and a Cleaning Cassette. The MEDTOXScan® Positive and Negative QC Test
Devices are intended to detect errors associated with the MEDTOXScan®
Reader and a contaminated contact imaging sensor (CIS) and to verify that the CIS
cleaning procedure using the MEDTOXScan® Cleaning Cassette effectively removed
any contamination.

4. Special instrument requirements:
PROFILE®-V MEDTOXScan®
I. Device Description:
The PROFILE®-V MEDTOXScan® Drugs of Abuse Test System includes an instrument
and drugs of abuse cassettes that detect specific drugs in urine. The PROFILE®-V
MEDTOXScan® Test Device includes antibody-colloidal gold, drug-conjugates and a
control line. A test line will form when drug in the sample is below the detection threshold
(negative result). The MEDTOXScan® Reader scans the test device and utilizes a contact
imaging sensor (CIS) to capture relative line intensities. Software algorithms and barcodes
are used to identify the test device, the drug tests associated with the test device and whether
the presence or absence of a line is associated with a negative or positive result, respectively.
The MEDTOXScan® Reader includes a Positive QC Test Device, a Negative QC Test
Device and a Cleaning Cassette. The MEDTOXScan® Positive and Negative QC Test.

J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Biosite Triage Tox Drug Screen
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
k060791
3. Comparison with predicate:
Both devices are for the qualitative determination of the same analyte in the same matrix.
Both devices use immunochromatographic lateral flow technology.
The candidate device uses gold-conjugated reagents to generate the reddish-purple test
and controls lines, which are read by the instrument. The predicate device uses
fluorescent-conjugated reagents to generate control and test lines that are not visible and
can be read only by the instrument.
The predicate device detects Acetaminophen and Tricyclic Antidepressants in addition to
the same nine drugs of abuse detected by the candidate device. The cutoff concentrations
vary, with the candidate device having lower cutoffs in all but two of the assays, i.e.,
THC and PCP.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI Guidance EP-12A User Protocol for the Evaluation of Qualitative Test Performance
L. Test Principle:
The PROFILE®-V MEDTOXScan® Drugs of Abuse Test System includes a competitive,
membrane-based immunochromatographic PROFILE®-V MEDTOXScan® Test Device and
the MEDTOXScan® Reader.
Antibody-Colloidal Gold: Mouse monoclonal antibodies bind to the drug being tested.
Drug-Conjugates: Each drug to be tested was individually conjugated to bovine serum
albumin (BSA) or IgG. Each drug conjugate is immobilized on a test line at a designated
position on the membrane strip.
Control Line: Each test strip has anti-mouse antibody immobilized at the Control (C) position
of the membrane strip. The anti-mouse antibody will bind excess antibody-colloidal gold,
indicating that the reagents are migrating properly. When the urine sample is placed in the
sample well of a test strip, the dried antibody-colloidal gold under the sample pad dissolves
and the urine wicks up the white strips carrying the reddish-purple antibody-colloidal gold
with it.
4

--- Page 5 ---
Negative Samples
When no drug(s) is present in the urine sample, the reddish purple antibody-colloidal gold
solutions migrate along the strip and bind to the respective drug conjugate(s) immobilized on
the membrane. Each strip has up to 4 drug test lines labeled T1 – T4. The binding of the
antibody-colloidal gold to the drug conjugate generates a line at the corresponding test (T)
position on the strip. The MEDTOXScan® Reader will scan each test position and if a
line is detected it will return “NEG” on the display screen (or print out) next to the
abbreviation for the drug test, indicating a negative result.
Positive Samples
When drug(s) is present in the urine sample the antibody-colloidal gold binds to the drug(s)
before it migrates along the strip. When the antibody colloidal gold binds to the drug(s) in the
urine, it cannot bind to the drug conjugate immobilized on the membrane and no line is
generated at the drug specific position in the result window. The MEDTOXScan® Reader
will scan each test position and if no line is detected it will return “POS” on the display
screen (or print out) next to the abbreviation for the drug test, indicating a preliminary
positive result.
Control Line (Valid or Invalid results)
Each test strip has an internal procedural control. A line must form at the Control (C)
position in the result window to indicate that sufficient sample was applied and that the
reagents are migrating properly. If a Control line does not form, the test is invalid. The
MEDTOXScan® Reader scans each control line and returns “VALID” to the right of the
drug test result to confirm that the control line was detected. If no control line is detected it
will return “INVALID” on the display screen next to the abbreviation for the invalid drug
test, and no result will be given for the drug test.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Urine stock solutions were prepared for each of the test compounds by spiking
standard solution of known concentration into commercially available negative pool
urine or into an in-house negative pool prepared from fresh drug-free urines (pH 6-7,
Specific Gravity 1.012-1.018). Each stock solution was assayed by GC/MS or
LC/MS/MS. The average value obtained was used to make serial dilutions
around the cutoff value to obtain from 150% of cutoff down to 10% of the
cutoff. The stock solution was diluted with negative pool urine to obtain the serial
dilutions.

No calibrators are required. The device is calibrated during the manufacturing
process.
d. Detection limit:
Sensitivity of qualitative assays may be characterized by validating performance
around the claimed cutoff concentration of the assay, and demonstrating the lowest
concentration of drug that is capable of or consistently producing a positive result.
This information appears in the precision section, 1.a., above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking various concentrations of similarly
structured drug compounds into drug-free urine. The tables below summarize the
results of cross-reactivity studies using various common and structurally similar
compounds. Results are expressed as the minimum concentration of metabolite or
compound required to produce a positive test result (or, if no cross-reactivity
observed, “none detected”).

pH and Specific Gravity:
To test for possible positive and/or negative interference from pH, the sponsor prepared
two study control samples. The control samples consisted of drug free urine spiked with
the calibrator drugs at negative and positive concentrations. Aliquots of the control
samples were adjusted to a pH of 4.0, 7.0, and 9.0. Each sample was assayed in triplicate.
No negative interference due to pH was observed.
To test for possible positive and/or negative interference from specific gravity the
sponsor, prepared two study control samples. The control samples consisted of drug free
urine spiked with the calibrator drugs at negative and positive concentrations. Aliquots of
the control samples were altered to span the specific gravity range of 1.007 to 1.031. No
positive or negative interference due to specific gravity was observed.
Common Drugs:
Drug free urine samples were spiked with the Profile V targeted drugs to the
concentrations of 25% and 150% of the cutoff concentrations. 100 µg/mL of the
common drugs listed below, were then added to the preparation and assayed. Evaluations
were performed in triplicate by in-house operators. None of the common drugs listed in
the following table affected the expected results.
COMMON DRUGS EVALUATED WITH MedTox Scan Drugs of Abuse Test System
Acetylsalicylic Acid Chlorpheniramine Ibuprofen
Acetaminophen Cocaine-COC Morphine-OPI
Brompheniramine maleate Doxylamine Phenobarbital
Caffeine Dextromethorphan d-Pseudoephedrine
Carbamazepine Diphenylhydantoin Salicylic Acid
There is the possibility that other substances and/or factors not listed above may
interfere with the test and cause false results.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration appears in the precision section, 1.a, above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance was evaluated by assaying a panel of masked unaltered clinical urine
samples containing varying concentrations of drugs with Profile V device. Results were
then compared to GC/MS or LC/MS/MS results. Samples were obtained from MedTox
Laboratories. Samples less than -50% of the cutoff, near cutoff negative (between -50%
and the cutoff), near cutoff positive (between cutoff and +50%) and high positive (+50%)
were confirmed by GC/MS or LC/MS/MS for Benzodiazepines. Testing was performed
in-house. Readings were taken at 10 minutes and reported in this table.
