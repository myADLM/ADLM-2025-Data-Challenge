The Blood pressure and glucose monitor, Duo-Max™ consists of a meter with
wrist cuff and glucose test strips. The glucose test system is intended for use in
the quantitative measurement of glucose in capillary whole blood taken from the
fingertip, dorsal hand, ventral palm, upper arm, forearm, calf and thigh. Glucose
testing is done outside the body (In Vitro diabetes mellitus, or in clinical settings
by healthcare professionals. Glucose testing system is not to be used for the
diagnosis or screening of diabetes. It is not intended for use on neonates. Also the
blood pressure test system measures systolic and diastolic blood pressure and
pulse rate from adult’s wrist in the home care environment. The device employs a
wrist cuff and the oscillomentric metric method of measurement.

L. Test Principle:
Glucose measurement is based on electrical potential caused by the reaction of
glucose with the reagents contained on the strip’s electrodes. The glucose in the
sample is oxidized by the enzyme glucose oxidase, and the current resulting from this
enzymatic reaction is measured and converted to glucose concentration by the meter.
The magnitude of the current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the
sample.
Blood pressure: the pressure sensor in the cuff detects small changes in pressure and
converts them to electrical signals. The meter analyzes the signals and converts them
to standard measurements of pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-Run
The testing was conducted using venous blood, collected in a heparin
blood collection tube. Glucose was added to the blood to prepare 5
different levels of glucose for the testing. The glucose concentration ranges

Interference testing showed that the system results in less than ±10% bias (or
±10 mg/dL for glucose samples less than 60 mg/dL) in the presence of high
concentrations of interferants, even beyond clinically significant ranges.

--- Page 8 ---
An altitude study was performed with 9 venous blood samples ranging from
30 to 530 mg/dL. Testing was performed at altitudes of sea level and 10,000
feet (using a chamber). The test data showed that the bias versus YSI at
10,000 feet is the same bias versus YSI observed at sea level. These data
indicate no additional effect due to altitude up to the claimed altitude of
10,000 feet.
Hematocrit interference was evaluated by adjusting the glucose concentrations
and hematocrit levels of venous blood samples. The venous blood samples
were spiked to 8 glucose concentrations (40, 70, 110, 180, 250, 350, 450, and
550 mg/dL. The hematocrit levels were adjusted to 30%, 40%, 55%. Each
sample was assayed 15 times and the maximum percent bias was calculated
compared to the 40% hematocrit samples. The sponsor demonstrated that the
bias did not exceed ±15 mg/dL when glucose concentration is ≤75 mg/dL and
bias did not exceed ±15% when glucose concentration is >75 mg/dL for
hematocrit concentrations within the claimed range of 30% to 55%.

that lot. The code number is associated with the meter by inserting a test strip and
entering the code number to match that found on the test strip bottle. No further
calibrations are required of the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor has two levels of controls available for this meter with one level
coming with the kit. When a test strip is inserted into the meter, a control can be
run. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial
label. The user is referred to a troubleshooting section at the end of the control
test instructions of the owner’s manual to identify possible reasons control results
fall outside these ranges.
