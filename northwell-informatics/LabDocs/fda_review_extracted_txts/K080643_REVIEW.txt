H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for Use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
For use in the verification of calibration established by the Elecsys Anti-TSHR
reagent on the indicated Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Prescription Use Only
4. Special instrument requirements:

I. Device Description:
The Elecsys Anti-TSHR CalCheck is a lyophilized product consisting of human
anti-TSHR antibodies in human serum matrix. During manufacture, the antibody
is spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels. The control material
is provided at three levels of 1ml each.
All components of the control are tested individually and shown to be free of
HBsAG and antibodies to HCV and HIV. The testing methods used were FDA
approved or cleared with the European Directive 98/79/EC Annex II List A.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Elecsys C-Peptide CalCheck
2. Predicate K number(s):

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: Standardized against NIBSC 1st IS 90/672 Standard
Value Assignment: Values are assigned using a minimum of three Elecsys
2010 / cobas e 411 and three MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 / cobas e 601
Immunoassay Analyzers. Six independent series of analyses are performed on
each instrument platform. The target value is calculated as the median of the
determined values. Approximate target values are found in the following
table. Lot-specific target values may differ slightly after value assignment.

Level (IU/L)
Check 1 (low) < 1.0
Check 2

(medium)
Check 3 (high) 38
Stability: Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were described
and found to be acceptable. The CalCheck is stable until the expiration date
printed on the vial when stored unopened at 2 – 8° C. Reconstituted vials are
stable for five hours at 15 - 25°C.
