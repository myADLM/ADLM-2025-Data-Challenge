L. Test Principle:
Genzyme Cystatin C is based on the sol particle turbidimetric immunoassay principle.
It contains colloidal gold particles coated with anti-cystatin C specific polyclonal
antibodies. The reaction between the particles and any cystatin C in samples results in
the formation of agglutinates and an associated change in absorbance signal. The
change in absorbance signal is proportional to the amount of cystatin C in the sample.
Cystatin C concentration in the sample is determined by comparison with a standard
curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
All performance testing was performed on the Abbott Aeroset Automated Analyzer.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility studies were conducted by testing four levels controls and
three serum pools. The samples were run in duplicate, twice a day for twenty
days using one lot and one instrument. The results are presented in the table
below:
Mean Within-Run Total
Control mg/L SD CV% SD CV%
Control A1 0.52 0.01 2.8 0.02 3.6
Control A2 2.10 0.02 0.7 0.03 1.3
Control B1 0.33 0.02 5.0 0.02 6.4
Control B3 0.67 0.01 1.6 0.01 1.8

M ed Serum Pool 2.79 0.02 0.7 0.04 1.3
High Serum Pool 5.06 0.08 1.5 0.12 2.4
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by inter diluting a sample
spiked (high sample) with cystatin C with a cystatin C free serum sample
across the range of 0 to 10mg/L to create nine additional samples. Each
sample was tested in replicates of ten. The linear regression equation was
y = 0.96x – 0.18, R2 = 0.9917. The reportable range of the assay is 0.2 – 8.0
mg/L (the value of the highest calibrator).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Cystatin C calibrator is traceable to a stock of concentrated recombinant
Cystatin C Standard. There is no internationally recognized reference
standard for cystatin C. The calibrator has six levels (0-8.0 mg/L). The high
calibrator is prepared directly from the source material, than serially diluted to
achieve the remaining concentrations. All lots are run against the in-house
primary standard calibration material for final value assignment.
Quality controls are recommended, but not supplied by the sponsor.
Accelerated and real time stability studies have been conducted. Protocols and
acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The
manufacturer claims the following:
Unopened stored at 2-8 ºC the assay reagent and calibrator are good until the
expiration date.
After opening stored at 2-8 ºC the assay reagent and calibrator are good for 4
weeks.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) - a blank sample was assayed on multiple
instrument channels in replicates of five twice a day for five days for a total of
165 replicates. The LoB was determined to be 0.02 mg/L.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) – 12 low level samples with concentrations less
than 4 mg/L and assayed in 10 replicates. The pooled SD for the samples was
0.02 mg/L. The LoD was determined to be 0.05 mg/L.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) – The sponsor defined the LoQ as where the
CV is less than or equal to 10% (with the low end samples’ pooled standard
deviation at 0.02 mg/L). The LoQ is 0.20 mg/L
e. Analytical specificity:
Two serum samples containing cystatin C at concentrations of 0.44 mg/L and
1.30 mg/L were evaluated for interference. Sponsor states that no significant
interference is defined as cystatin C <1 mg/L observed value to be within +
0.1 mg/L and > 1 mg/L observed value to be within + 10% of the control
sample. The following substances demonstrated no significant interference:

A list of other compounds were evaluated for interference and found to have
no significant interference or cross reactivity. A list of these compounds is
present in the product labeling.
Hook effect- The hook effect of the Genzyme cystatin C immunoassay was
evaluated by using a spiked serum sample (25 mg/L) and making a serial
dilution and tested. The sponsor claimed that there is no observed hook effect
up to 25 mg/L.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A split sample method comparison study was conducted between the
Genzyme Cystatin C method and the Dade-Behring N Latex Cystatin C
method. 148 serum samples ranging from 0.48 to 7.73 mg/L were tested on
the Abbott Aeroset analyzer and Dade Behring BNII analyzer. The correlation
is y = 1.11x + 0.10 with a r2 of 0.997.
The data demonstrate a slight positive bias compared to the predicate device,
but the correlation was strong. This data, in conjunction with the sponsor’s
reference range study (see below) allow the device to be labeled so that users
can adequately interpret results.
b. Matrix comparison:
A serum / plasma comparison test was performed for the Genzyme Cystatin C
assay. 56 serum samples were compared to matched Lithium Heparin and
EDTA plasma samples. Of the 56 samples 41 were native of which 9 were
