L. Test Principle:
The assay is intended for the quantitative measurement of phenytoin in human
serum or plasma using Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA)
technology. The patient sample, anti- phenytoin coated paramagnetic
microparticles, and phenytoin acridinium-labeled conjugate are combined to
create a reaction mixture. The anti-phenytoin coated microparticles bind to
phenytoin present in the sample and to the phenytoin acridinium-labeled
conjugate. After washing, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the
reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative
light units (RLUs). An indirect relationship exists between the amount of
phenytoin in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT i System
optics.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Following CLSI EP5-A2, the sponsor evaluated the precision using three
reagents and three levels of Multi-constituent Controls (MCC) Level 1,
Level 2, and Level 3 with concentrations at approximately 7, 14, and 25
ug/mL) and three serum panels prepared by adding phenytoin into a pool
of human sera at approximately 10, 20, and 30 ug/mL concentrations of
phenytoin. Precision tests were run on three ARCHITECT i systems using
three lots of reagents and one lot of calibrators. Studies were carried out in
duplicates of two runs per day over 20 days (total of 80 data points). The
results are tabulated below.

Based on the recovery data and the limit of detection described below, the
sponsor established the assay measuring range for ARCHITECT iPhenytoin
assay as 0.50 μg/mL – 40.0 μg/mL.
Following CLSI document EP6-A, the sponsor conducted an additional study
to further evaluate the measurement range of 0.50 to 40.00 μg/mL using Five
individual serum samples and 5 individual Potassium EDTA plasma samples
(frozen) were each spiked with a 4 mg/mL phenytoin solution to target sample
concentration values greater than 40.00 μg/mL. Each of the ten samples was
diluted to 11 concentration levels. One lot of reagents was used to test neat
samples in replicates of 4 and diluted samples in duplicates. Each sample was
diluted using the ARCHITECT iPhenytoin Calibrator A. The mean percent
recovery of the diluted serum samples ranged from 100.6% to 106.1% and the
mean percent recovery of the diluted plasma samples ranged from 99.5% to
101.8%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrators are sold separately and the labeling recommends using
commercially available control materials for the quality control procedure.
The sponsor provided the protocols for preparation and value assignment for
calibrators. The Internal Standard Calibrators are manufactured
gravimetrically using purified synthetic Phenytoin from the US Pharmacopeia
(USP) Reference Standard. The ARCHITECT iPhenytoin Calibrators are
matched to the Internal Standard Calibrators, which consists of calibrator
buffer (MES, Dextrose and ProClin 300), Phenytoin and stabilizer. Calibrator
A is prepared from human serum and contains sodium azide with ProClin.
The target concentrations for Calibrators B-F are 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 ug/mL
Phenytoin. The stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and
found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
To determine the lower limit of the assay range, the sponsor evaluated limit of
detection (LOD) and limit of blank (LOB) using CLSI document EP17-A
“Protocol for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation;
Approved Guideline” The sponsor used 2 instruments, 2 lots of reagents and 2
lots of calibrators for testing on a panel of 5 samples with low phenytoin
concentrations and a blank sample with 0 μg/mL phenytoin. The samples with
phenytoin were prepared by diluting low phenytoin serum sample with a blank
sample. Three runs were performed for each reagent lot. Each run consisted of
20 replicates of a blank sample (0 μg/mL) and 5 replicates of each low level
phenytoin sample for a total of 60 replicates of the blank and 15 replicates of
each low level phenytoin samples. Based on the 95th percentile calculation
described in the CLSI EP17-A, LOD was determined using the algorithm, LoD
= LoB [1.645 / (1 - 1 / 4 x df)] σS. Data in the 510(k) support the claim for the
lower limit of the reportable range, 0.50 μg/mL.

e. Analytical specificity:
Following CLSI EP7-A2 guidelines, the sponsor evaluated the effect of
endogenous potential interferents on Architect i Phenytoin Assay. The
interferents included triglycerides (2500 mg/dL), hemoglobin (500 mg/dL),
low protein (3 g/dL), high protein (10 g/dL), and bilirubin (15 mg/dL). Five
human serum samples with Phenytoin concentrations targeted at 10 and 20
μg/mL were used to prepare the test panel. These human serum samples were
spiked with the interferent for the test sample. An equal volume of interferent
diluent was spiked into the samples to prepare the control sample. Mean
recovery was within 100 ± 10% of the control results for the above
interferents and at the concentrations tested.
The sponsor evaluated the effect of HAMA and rheumatoid factor (RF) by
testing specimens with HAMA and RF to assess their effect on the Architect
iPhenytoin Assay. Five human serum samples positive for Phenytoin
concentrations targeted at 10 and 20 ug/mL were used to prepare the interfering
panel. These human serum samples were spiked with the interferent for the test
sample. An equal volume of interferent diluent was spiked into the samples to
prepare the control sample Mean recovery was within 100 ± 10% of the control
results for HAMA and RF.
Following CLSI EP7-A2 guidelines, the sponsor conducted a study to
evaluate the potential cross-reactivity of the ARCHITECT i Phenytoin assay
when tested with structurally similar compounds. For all cross-reactants tested
(except Fosphenytoin), two pools of sera, one with essentially no residual
phenytoin and one with a low level of phenytoin were split into 3 different
parts. Two parts were spiked with phenytoin to reach target concentrations
between approximately 9.37 and 20.23 ug/mL and the third part was not
spiked with phenytoin. Compounds were spiked into the samples above to
prepare the test sample and an equal volume of the interferent diluent was
spiked to the samples to prepare the control sample. The test and control
samples were tested five times. For the Fosphenytoin testing, two frozen
normal human serum containing no phenytoin were spiked with Fosphenytoin
and within 10 minutes, tested on the ARCHITECT system. The sponsor
defined interference as mean percent recovery greater than +/-10% of initial
values at therapeutic concentrations. No interference was detected at the
concentrations tested.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor performed an in-house evaluation. Measurements from the
Architect iPhenytoin were compared to the Abbott Axsym Phenytoin. One
hundred fifty-four (154) individual specimens were measured ranging from
1.45 to 39.63 μg/mL as measured on the Architect i System. Six samples were
spiked to achieve concentrations at the upper end of the 40 μg/mL measuring
range. Two samples were excluded from the analysis because they were below
the 0.50 ug/mL measuring range. The analysis of data using Passing & Bablok
produced a regression equation of y = .996x - 0.266. The following table
demonstrates the correlation between the two methods.
Slope Intercept Correlation
(95% C.I) (95% C.I) Coefficient
154 0.996 -0.266 0.993
(0.980 to 1.011) (0.409 to -0.139)
A bias analysis of ARCHITECT iPhenytoin vs. AxSYM Phenytoin was
performed on the same 154 specimens in the range of 1.45 to 39.63 μg/mL
and 1.44 to 35.49μg/mL respectively. The average bias exhibited by
ARCHITECT vs. AxSYM in this study was -3.95%. The 95% confidence
interval of that average bias is - 18.12 to 10.22%. Within the typical
therapeutic range of phenytoin therapy (10 to 20 μg/mL), the average bias was
-2.73% with a 95% confidence interval of -14.61 to 9.15%.
b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor conducted matrix comparison studies using 20 matched serum
and plasma samples prepared with seven anticoagulants (2K-EDTA, 3K-
EDTA, Na-Citrate, K-Oxalate, Na-Heparin and Li-Heparin). FDA cleared
blood collection tubes were used. Serum tubes without anticoagulants were
used as the control. To evaluate the anticoagulant effect along the assay
measuring range, each of the 20 sets of serum/plasma tubes were spiked with
phenytoin to obtain five matched sets below the therapeutic range (0.5 to < 10
ug/mL), 10 matched sets to target within the therapeutic range (10 to 20
ug/mL) and 5 matched sets to target above the therapeutic range (>20 to </=
40 ug/mL). The samples were analyzed in triplicate with one lot of
ARCHITECT i Phenytoin reagents on the ARCHITECT i System. Mean
recovery was within 100 ± 10% vs. serum results. Results shown in the table
