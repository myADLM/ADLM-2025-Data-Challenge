Abbott m2000 System
Device Description:
Abbott RealTime CT/NG consists of two reagent kits:
• Abbott RealTime CT/NG Amplification Reagent Kit (List No. 8L07-90)
• Abbott RealTime CT/NG Control Kit (List No. 8L07-80)
The Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay uses PCR technology with homogenous real-time
fluorescence detection on the m2000 System. The Abbott m2000 System consists of the
Abbott m2000sp and Abbott m2000rt instruments. The Abbott m2000 System integrates
sample preparation with nucleic acid amplification and detection to generate assay
results. The Abbott m2000sp is used for processing samples and the Abbott m2000rt is
used for amplification and detection.
The Abbott multi-Collect Specimen Collection Kit can be used to collect either a swab or
a urine specimen. Each Abbott multi -Collect Specimen Collection Kit (List No. 9K12)
contains:
• One Transport Tube containing 1.2 mL Specimen Transport Buffer
• One Individually Packaged Sterile Specimen Collection Swab (Part No. CD650)
• One disposable transfer pipette.
The Specimen Transport Buffer consists of guanidine thiocyanate, a chaotropic salt, in
Tris buffer and is used to stabilize DNA until sample preparation. The individually
packaged sterile Specimen Collection Swab is used for swab sample collection and
placed directly into the Transport Tube. The transfer pipette is used to add approximately
3 mL of urine to the Transport Tube. The Abbott multi -Collect Specimen Collection Kit
is for single use only.

Analytical Sensitivity
The analytical sensitivity of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay was determined by
testing dilutions of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) target DNA and Neisseria gonorrhoeae
(NG) target DNA. Testing was performed with three lots of amplification reagents on
three m2000 Systems. Probit analysis of the data determined that the concentration of CT
DNA detected with 95% probability was 39 copies/assay (95% CI 33 - 51), and the
concentration of NG DNA detected with 95% probability was 192 copies/assay (95% CI
176-220).
The limit of detection (LoD) claim for the RealTime CT/NG assay is 320 copies of CT
target DNA and 320 copies of NG target DNA per assay. The limit of detection (LoD) is
defined as the CT and NG DNA concentration detected with a probability of 95% or
greater.
The CT/NG assay targets the Chlamydia cryptic plasmid (present at approximately 7 to
10 copies per Chlamydia organism) and the multicopy opacity gene of Neisseria
gonorrhoeae (repeated up to 11 times per organism). Thus, 320 copies of target DNA
translates to approximately 30 to 40 organisms per assay.
The claimed LOD for the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay was confirmed by testing a
ample containing 320 copies of CT target DNA and 320 copies of NG target DNA per
assay. The detection rate was 100% (403/403) for both CT and NG in the assay. A study
was conducted to challenge the performance of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay in
samples containing high target numbers of either CT or NG in the presence of low target
numbers of the opposite analyte. The detection rate of 320 copies of CT DNA in the
presence of high NG target was 100% (400/400). The detection rate of 320 copies of NG
DNA in the presence of high CT target was 98.5% (398/404).

The analytical sensitivity of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay for detecting Chlamydia
trachomatis serovars A through L was determined by testing dilutions of each serovar.
Serovars A through K, L1, and L2 were detected at less than 1 Inclusion Forming Units
(IFU) per assay and serovar L3 was detected at less than 3 IFU/assay.
The analytical sensitivity of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay for detecting 28 different
isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae was determined by testing dilutions of each isolate. All
isolates were detected at less than 1 Colony Forming Unit (CFU)/assay.
Evaluation of Potential Cross-Reactants
A total of 111 strains of bacteria, viruses, parasites, yeast, and fungi were tested for
potential cross reactivity in the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay (table below). These
included organisms that are phylogenetically related to CT and NG, and those that can be
found in the urogenital tract. Purified DNA or RNA was diluted to a final concentration
of 1 x 107copies/assay. HBV DNA and HCV RNA were added directly into the PCR
reaction at approximately 3 x 105and 9 x 106copies per reaction, respectively. All results
were negative for both CT and NG.
A total of 32 culture isolates were tested for potential cross reactivity in the Abbott
RealTime assay. These included 27 organisms listed in table below, and Neisseria
cinerea, Neisseria lactamica, Neisseria sicca, Ca Ski cells containing HPV 16, and Hela
cells containing HPV 18. Ca Ski cells containing HPV 16 and Hela cells containing HPV
18 were tested at 105cells per assay, C. pneumoniae and C. psittaci were tested at 106EB
per assay, HSV-1 and HSV-2 were tested at 106genomes per assay, and the rest of the
organisms were tested at 106Colony Forming Units (CFU) per assay. All results were
negative for both CT and NG.

Precision Study
A precision study was performed at three sites, two external and one internal. Each site
was provided with a nine-member panel that was prepared targeting different
combinations of CT and NG concentrations. The targeted concentration for CT ranged
from 0 to 4,500 IFU/assay and for NG from 0 to 2,000 CFU/assay. Five replicates of each
panel member were tested in each run. Thirty runs (10 per site) were performed for a total
of 150 replicates of each panel member. The study included three amplification reagent
lots. Each site tested two amplification reagent lots. A variance components analysis for a

Summary of Clinical Studies
Performance characteristics of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay were established in a
multi-center clinical study conducted in the United States. Specimens were prospectively
collected from subjects at 16 geographically diverse sites that included physician private
practices, public and private STD clinics, and a hospital emergency room. A total of
3,832 male and female, asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects were enrolled. Study
subjects were classified as symptomatic if the subject reported STD-related symptoms.

Specimens collected from each female subject included urine, endocervical swabs, self-
collected vaginal swab, and clinician-collected vaginal swabs. Specimens collected from
each male subject included urine and urethral swabs. Specimen testing methods included
the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay, two commercially available nucleic acid
amplification tests (NAAT) for CT and NG, and culture for NG. The NAATs and the NG
culture were used as reference assays in the clinical study.
For females, self-collected vaginal swab and urine specimens were collected first,
followed by endocervical swab for culture. Remaining swab specimen collection was
randomized to minimize bias. For males, urethral swab for culture was collected first.
Remaining swab specimen collection was randomized to minimize bias. Urine specimen
was collected after the swab specimens.
For each subject, a patient infected status was determined based on the combined results
from the reference assays. A female subject was categorized as infected for CT or NG if a
minimum of two positive results (at least one from each reference NAAT) were reported.
A male subject was categorized as infected for CT or NG if a minimum of two positive
results were reported. If the reference NG culture assay result was positive, the subject
was categorized as infected regardless of NAAT results.
A female subject was categorized as not infected with CT or NG if at least one of the If
patient infected status could not be determined due to missing and/or indeterminate
results from the reference assays, the subject was excluded from the analysis. Patient
infected status could not be determined for 33 subjects for CT and 35 subjects for NG.
The tables below summarize the clinical trial data.
