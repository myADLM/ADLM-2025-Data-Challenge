L. Test Principle:
The ARCHITECT Cyclosporine assay is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative
determination of cyclosporine in human whole blood using CMIA technology. Prior
to the initiation of the automated ARCHITECT sequence, a manual pretreatment step
is performed in which the whole blood sample is lysed and extracted. The supernatant
is placed onto the ARCHITECT i System.
In the first step, sample, assay diluent, and anti-cyclosporine coated paramagnetic
microparticles are combined. Cyclosporine present in sample binds to the anti-
cyclosporine coated microparticles. Cyclosporine acridinium-labeled conjugate is
added in the second step. Following another wash cycle, pre-trigger and trigger
solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction
is measured as relative light units (RLUs). An indirect relationship exists between the
amount of cyclosporine in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT i
System optics.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were preformed in accordance with CLSI guideline EP5-A2
“Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods
(2004)”. Three studies (one at the manufacturer’s site and two at external
sites) were performed to assess the precision including the effect of the
manual drug extraction procedure. Prior to running each replicate the manual
pretreatment step was performed using the ARCHITECT Cyclosporine Whole

ranging from 38-1500 ng/mL were evaluated. A parallel set of dilutions was
prepared using ARCHITECT Cyclosporine Calibrator A as the diluent.
Following the manual pretreatment step which was performed separately for each
dilution, samples were evaluated on the ARCHITECT in replicates of five, and
mean percent recovery (of the 5 replicates) was calculated:
Averaged recoveries relative to gravimetrically-determined values were within
10% (99-109%) without observed trends (for both whole blood and Calibrator A
diluent).
Linearity:
Whole blood specimens were spiked to achieve cyclosporine values ranging from
approximately 30 ng/mL 1400 ng/mL, and EDTA whole blood samples were used
as the diluent for the respective spiked samples. The manual pretreatment step
was performed after the spiked whole blood specimens were diluted with the
respective EDTA whole blood. Samples were tested in replicates of five (5) from
one (1) transplant pretreatment tube using the ARCHITECT Cyclosporine assay.
Results supporting linearity to the assay lower limit of 30 ng/mL are shown in the
graph below. The resulting regression equation is y=1.0084x + 4.563 with a
correlation coefficient of 0.997.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ARCHITECT Cyclosporine Calibrators kit is comprised of 6 levels (A-F)
of cyclosporine (0, 40, 150, 400, 800 and 1500 ng/ml).
Open vial stability was assessed via real time studies Three lots of the
calibrators stored at 2-8 C were used to evaluate two samples and three
controls (MCC) at monthly intervals. Closed vial stability was assessed by
stress testing 2 lots of calibrators stored at 2-8 ˚C, 15 ˚C and 25 ˚C. Each lot
and storage condition was assayed at day 0, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 17, 26, 28, 35, 42,
56, 65, 75, 85, 95, 105 and 120. Recovery of the test samples were consistent
(no apparent trends) within the time range tested.
An on-board sample stability study was conducted for 3 hours, as claimed by
the manufacturer. Samples with concentrations spanning much of the assay
range were spilt (one was stored at 2-8 C) and run at time 0 and after 3 hours. .
Percent recovery was within 10% of the mean value obtained from time 0.
The calibrators are traceable to a USP reference material. Cyclosporine
reference calibrators B-F are tested and value assigned by HPLC with MS/MS
detection.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Detection (LOD) of the ARCHITECT Cyclosporine assay
supports the manufacturer’s claim of a low reportable limit of < 30.0 ng/mL.
The sponsor conducted a study to determine the lowest concentration of
cyclosporine at which the sample CV is equal to 20% for the ARCHITECT
Cyclosporine assay in accordance with CLSI EP5-A2. Seven samples were
prepared by spiking EDTA whole blood with cyclosporine stock solution to
obtain concentrations of 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 and 50 ng/ml. Ten replicates for
each of the samples were run twice per day for five days. Results support
≤20% CV at the lower limit of the reportable range of 30.0 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity:
The effects of major cyclosporine metabolites, potential endogenous
interferent and co-administered common or immunosuppressive drugs on
assay performance were evaluated based on CLSI EP7-A. In order to assess
cross-reactivity of cyclosporine metabolites, 1000 ng/ml of each metabolite
(AM19, AM1c, AM9, AM4N and AM1) were spiked into whole blood
samples containing a cyclosporine concentration ranging from 70.0 ng/ml to
1357 ng/ml. Percent cross-reactivity was calculated using the equation:
% Cross-Reactivity = 100*(Measured Value – Measured Value
With Cross-Reactant
/ Amount of Cross-Reactant Added .

The effects of bilirubin (40 mg/dL), Cholesterol (500 mg/dl), uric acid (20
mg/dl), triglycerides (1500 mg/dl), hematocrit (25% and 55%), total protein (3
and 12 g/dl), HAMA and RF were evaluated through a recovery study.
Whole blood samples were spiked with various levels of cyclosporine ranging
from 87.1 to 693.3 ng/mL. The recovery observed during the study ranged
from 97 % to 108%.
Commonly co-administered drugs, including immunosuppressant drugs, were
evaluated for interference. Whole blood was spiked with cyclosporine to
achieve a low and high level cyclosporine concentrations ranging from 80 to
800 ng/mL. The control was the sample without the added drug. A list of the
66 drugs tested can be found in the package insert under the potentially
interfering pharmaceutical substances section. Cyclosporine recoveries in the
presence of most drugs tested were within 90-110% of the control sample.
Observed recoveries for substances that fell outside of the +/-10% were
observed for the compounds. Recoveries ranged from 84% to 118%.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed at three sites including the
manufacturer’s site and two external sites. The ARCHITECT Cyclosporine
Assay was compared to LCMS at one of the sites. The sponsor also compared
the ARCHITECT results to those of the TDx/TDxFLx Cyclosporine
Monoclonal Whole Blood.
Samples tested were from unaltered whole blood specimens from patients
undergoing cyclosporine therapy following heart, liver, or kidney transplants.
Studies were performed using routine methods for quality control and
calibration as described in the package insert. The patient samples included
73 from cardiac transplant patients; 77 from kidney transplant patients; and 77
from liver transplant patients. Patient samples included 191 samples from 169
individuals. The mean patient age was 54 (ranging from 22-79). Samples
10

were from men (125) and women (66). Samples included C2 time points as
well as pre-dose (Co) time points and were from patients representing both
acute (short time post-transplant) and chronic (longer time post-transplant).
The sponsor reported results of Passing-Bablok and linear regression analyses
for both the overall results and by transplant type. The data below and
correlation coefficients are based on single measurements of each sample.
Samples spanned the range from 31 to 1460 ng/mL.

In this study, trough specimens (which had cyclosporine values typically < 400)
exhibited less variability and less bias than C2 specimens. Similarly, “chronic”
(greater time post-transplant) condition specimens exhibited less variability and
less bias than “acute” (shorter time post-transplant) condition specimens. This
may also be related to the fact that trough specimens and chronic condition
specimens had a greater proportion of low cyclosporine values (which had lower
bias and less variability) relative to C2 and acute condition specimens (which had
relatively more bias and variability). Bias and variability relative to LCMS are
presented in the package insert.

other factors contribute to different requirements for optimal blood levels of
cyclosporine. Therefore, individual cyclosporine values cannot be used as the sole
indicator for making changes in treatment regimen and each patient should be
thoroughly evaluated clinically before changes in treatment regimens are made.
Each user must establish his or her own ranges based on clinical experience.
Therapeutic ranges vary according to the commercial test used, and therefore
should be established for each commercial test. Values obtained with different
assay methods cannot be used interchangeably due to differences in assay
methods and cross-reactivity with metabolites, nor should correction factors be
applied. Therefore, consistent use of one assay for individual patients is
recommended.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
a substantial equivalence decision.
