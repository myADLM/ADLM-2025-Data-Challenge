I. Device Description:
The VIDAS® RUB IgG assay is an enzyme-linked fluorescent immunoassay (ELFA)
that consists of a two-step enzyme immunoassay sandwich method and a fluorescent
detection. All assay steps are automated by the VIDAS® instrument. The main
components of the device are a Solid Phase Receptacle (SPR®), which is a pipette tip-
like disposable device that serves as solid phase as well as a pipettor for the assay;
and a Reagent Strip, which consists of sealed wells containing the ready-to-use
reagents for the assay. The assay reactions take place by pipetting up and down the
reaction medium with the Solid Phase Receptacle (SPR®) through the wells of the
reagent strip. The sample is initially diluted, and follows a first incubation step in the
SPR®, where anti-Rubella IgG antibodies present in the sample bind to the rubella
antigen coating the interior of the SPR®. After a wash step to eliminate any unbound
component, a second incubation is performed using a monoclonal anti-human IgG
alkaline phosphatase conjugate. Following another wash step, the detection substrate
(4-methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate) is added to the SPR. The enzyme conjugate
catalyzes the hydrolysis of the substrate into a fluorescent product (4-methyl-
umbelliferone), and its fluorescence is measured by the VIDAS® instrument.
The intensity of the fluorescence is proportional to the concentration of rubella
antibodies present in the sample. Results are automatically determined by the
instrument based on the stored calibration curve and according to the CLSI I/LA6-A
recommended cut-off of 10 IU/mL. The assay is calibrated against the WHO 1st
International Standard for anti-Rubella Immunoglobulin, Human, Rubi 1-94,
(1997). The test results are to be used in conjunction with other clinical information
and history to suggest immune status against rubella virus.

L. Test Principle:
The VIDAS® RUB IgG II (RBG) Assay is performed in the automated VIDAS®
instruments. All assay parameters are controlled by the instrument. A pipette tip-like
disposable device, the Solid Phase Receptacle (SPR®), serves as the solid phase as
well as a pipettor for the assay. Reagents for the assay are provided in sealed RBG
Reagent Strips. The first well of the Reagent Strip is perforated to include the sample
to be tested. The last well of the Strip corresponds to a cuvette that is used for
fluorescent detection by the instrument. The SPR® performs the sample processing
for the assay while moving from well to well of the Reagent Strip. Anti-Rubella IgG
antibodies present in the sample will bind to the Rubella antigen coating the interior
of the SPR®. A monoclonal anti-human IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate is used in
conjunction with the substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate for fluorescent
detection.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Four serum samples were tested in duplicate twice a day (2 runs per day over
10 days) on each of the 2 reagent lots using a single instrument at each of
three sites (N = 240). The repeatability (intra-run precision), inter-run
precision, between-site precision and total precision were calculated according
to the CLSI® EP5-A2 document.

Quality Control:
The VIDAS® RUB IgG Assay quality controls used for the clinical
performance study included two levels: Negative (kit control C2) and high
positive (kit control C1) and were included in each run of the VIDAS®
instrument used for the clinical performance study. These controls must be
assayed immediately after opening a new kit to ensure that reagent
performance has not been altered. Each calibration must also be checked using
these controls. At a minimum, the VIDAS® calibration was performed every
14 days during the clinical study.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
VIDAS® RUB IgG Assay linearity studies were conducted according to
CLSI® EP6-A guidelines. One high concentration serum sample (> 250
IU/mL) and the Anti-Rubella Immunoglogulin WHO International Standard
(RUBI-1-94) were each serially diluted in a negative serum over the
measurement range. Each dilution was tested in triplicate. The VIDAS® RUB
IgG assay was was demonstrated to be linear from 0 IU/mL to 274 IU/mL.
The linear regression curve is:
Observed concentration = -1.608 + 0.996 * expected concentration, r2 = 0.99.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Concordance of the assay with the WHO International Standard was evaluated
using serial dilutions of the standard preparation into a negative serum sample.
The dilutions were tested with two lots of the VIDAS® RUB IgG Assay.
Linear regression for WHO doses (IU/mL) vs. VIDAS® results:
Observed concentration = 2.656 + 0.981 * expected concentration, r2 = 0.98.
Stability: Kit and Controls:
Storage:
Storage of the VIDAS® RUB IgG kit is recommended at 2-8°C. Do not freeze
reagents. Store all opened unused reagents at 2-8°C.
Kit shelf-life is lot specific. If stored according to the recommended
conditions, all components are stable until the expiration date indicated on the
label.

Heat inactivation:
Twenty-two serum samples were heated to a temperature of 56-58 ºC for 30
minutes to verity the effect on assay results of heat inactivation. Each sample
was tested before and after heat inactivation and the results were compared
using a linear regression. Acceptance criteria: heat treated sample titer is in a
range +/- 3 SD of the untreated sample. Results for six of the samples were
found to be significantly higher after treatment. It was concluded that heat
inactivated samples should not be used.
d. Detection limits:
LoB, LoD, and LoQ were evaluated for the VIDAS® RUB IgG Assay
according to CLSI EP17-A guideline, using one instrument one kit lot, and 6
human samples (one negative or blank, and 5 low levels). The blank sample
was tested in 12 replicates in a single run per day for 5 days; each low level
sample was tested in 4 replicates in a single run per day for 5 days. The
determination of LoB, LoD, and LoQ was based on 160 results (60 from
blank, and 100 from low level samples). To determine their accepted
reference value, each low level sample was tested in 4 replicates and two runs
on two different VIDAS® systems. All the four runs were tested on the same
day. LoB was determined to be = 0.24 IU/mL; LoD = 0.47 IU/mL; and LoQ =
0.80 IU/mL. All are reported at 0 IU/mL by the VIDAS® systems, and all
meet the clinical requirements of the test.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity:
The cross-reactivity of the VIDAS® RUB IgG assay was evaluated according
to CLSI® document EP7-A2 comparative measurement procedure. Patient
specimens were used to test for potential cross reactivity due to endogenous
antibodies generated by other disease states. 138 samples found by a different
commercially available test to have rubella IgG levels spanning the measuring
range of the VIDAS assay and demonstrating immunological reactivity to the
following 14 disease states using FDA-Cleared devices were evaluated on the
VIDAS and by the predicate assay. Comparative results between the different
disease states and healthy donors showed no bias. No cross-reactivity was
observed. Due to low prevalence of rubella antibody negative/cross-reacting
condition positive patients, cross-reactivity could not be adequately assessed
in other disease states. The end user should establish cross-reactivity
performance in these situations.

Interference:
Testing for interfering substances was conducted according to CLSI Protocol
EP7-A2 (Vol. 25, No. 27) using 3 human serum samples with values between
0.34 to 124.54 IU/mL. Test and control samples were evaluated in replicates
of 3 using 5 levels of the interferent substance. Acceptance criterion:
Recovery of positive samples within ± 15% of initial value. No significant
change in the quantitative and qualitative results of the VIDAS® RUB IgG kit
was observed in the substances tested at the specific levels indicated.
Interferent Material Tested Tested Concentration
Hemoglobin Up to 3.8 g/L Hemoglobin (239
µmol/L monomer hemoglobin)
Lipids Lipids up to 30 g/L equivalent in
triglycerides
Bilirubin Up to 540 µmol/L
Interpretation method: Doses were calculated with systematic recalibration.
The mean of the doses was obtained for each potential interfering substance
concentration level. The linear regression line coefficients were determined
between the observed analyte values and the associated interfering substance
concentrations. 95% confidence ranges were also determined and added to the
data sets. A test of the hypothesis, whereby the line slope is zero, was

evaluated and interpreted. If it was not possible to exclude the hypothesis at a
5% risk, it was determined to be possible to admit that no detrimental effect
on the assay was experienced with the interfering substance. If it was possible
to exclude it, a repeat of the analysis with lower interfering substance
concentrations was performed until no interfering effect on the assay was
found. The study concluded that no significant systematic effects on the assay
were detected for each potentially interfering substance at the described
levels.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off for the VIDAS® Rub IgG assay was set at 10 IU/mL based on the
WHO 1st International Standard for anti-Rubella Immunoglobulin, Human,
RUBI-1-94 (1997) in accordance to the CLSI guideline I/LA6-A (1997).
ROC curve analysis was performed in order to determine the accuracy of the
assay’s cutoff. The assay’s cut-off was set based on the CLSI Guideline and
evaluated on the observed results to guarantee the best levels of specificity,
without compromising the sensitivity. A grey zone between 5 and 10 IU/mL
was established due to observed assay imprecision. A sample is defined as
positive if the test value is equal to or greater than 10 IU/mL, and defined as
negative if the Index value is lower than 5 IU/mL. Samples with results
between 5 and 10 IU/mL are classified as equivocal.
WHO Metrological Traceability:
The international preparation (RUBI-1-94, WHO 1st International Standard for
anti-Rubella Immunoglobulin, Human, 1997) was used to prepare a dilution
curve in serum matrix to cover the assay range.
The metrological traceability process includes four levels:
RUBI-1-94 as reference standard for the assay. 10 data points, ranging
from 0 to 500 IU/ml, were generated by dilution of the RUBI-1-94 in a pool of
rubella IgG negative human serum.
Working standard and adjustment panel. The working standard (7 data
points) is the secondary standard which has values assigned based on RUBI-1-
94, and it is used together with the adjustment panel (6 data points) to
generate master calibration curves for each reagent lot.
Kit calibrator (S1), run by the users to provide instrument-specific
calibration curves and to compensate for possible minor variations in assay
signal throughout the shelf-life of the kit.
Patient samples, a panel of six samples representing the range of the assay.
The concentration of the working standard and adjustment panel was assessed
using the reference standard (RUBI-1-94) to generate a master curve. The
measurement of each data point was performed in duplicate, in 5 series for
each of two reagent lots. The final assigned values were the mean of the
values obtained on the two lots. There was no bias between concentrations
obtained from reference standard and working standard.
8

--- Page 9 ---
The analytical sensitivity was based on a dilution curve plotted with the mean
of each standard point. Regression analysis of the VIDAS® RUB IgG assay
results versus the calculated WHO standard concentration of each dilution was
evaluated (IU/mL).
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The performance of the VIDAS® RUB IgG assay was determined by percent
agreement among negative samples and percent agreement among positive
samples, against a reference method, in specific populations. The relevant
95% confidence limits were computed by applying the exact method.
All specimens were tested using the VIDAS® RUB IgG assay and three other
FDA-cleared Rubella IgG EIA assays according to their respective package
inserts. All testing was performed on a single specimen from the patient.
Samples with results above the reportable range of the VIDAS® RUB IgG
assay or the reportable range of the commercial assays were diluted according
to the respective package insert and re-assayed after dilution. Equivocal
results that remained equivocal after being re-tested, were considered
equivocal for the performance analysis.
The performance of the VIDAS® RUB IgG assay was determined by
comparison to a testing algorithm (Consensus Comparator) that utilizes a two
out of three results consensus as the final outcome for the predicate (using the
three FDA cleared devices): i.e. a sample with a concordant result by at least
two of the three commercial devices was defined as the consensus predicate
result. If the results by the three devices were either discordant among
themselves or concordant equivocal, the sample was classified as equivocal.
Specimens that were equivocal by both, the VIDAS® RUB IgG assay and the
consensus from the three commercial tests (total of 12 out of the 1,130), and
samples with quantity not sufficient for the 2/3 consensus method (8/1,130)
were not included in the percent agreement calculation. Positive or negative
results from the VIDAS® RUB IgG assay were considered as non-agreements
in the calculation of percent positive agreement and percent negative
agreement when the corresponding consensus comparator result was
equivocal. Comparison method: compared number of samples positive on
both tests to sum of all positive samples on the reference method + samples
equivocal on the comparator method and negative on the VIDAS® RUB IgG
assay. Compared number of samples negative on both tests to sum of all
negative samples on the reference method + samples equivocal on the
comparator method and positive on the VIDAS® RUB IgG assay.
Bias estimation:
The comparison study was based on the CLSI EP9-A2 guideline “Method
Comparison and Bias Estimation Using patient samples”. A total of 80
samples were tested in duplicate (within the same run) with the VIDAS® RUB
IgG and the Abbott AxSYM Rubella IgG assays. 40 of these samples were
9

--- Page 10 ---
pre-selected negative sera with concentrations <10 IU/mL and 40 were pre-
selected low-positive sera (10-20 IU/mL). This same data set was also used to
determine the % reproducibility of VIDAS® RUB IgG assay at the <10 IU/mL
and 10-20 IU/mL levels. The Passing-Bablok regression method was used to
estimate the intercept and the slope, and simple linear regression was used to
estimate the expected (average) bias and the confidence interval for the
expected bias at the 10 IU/mL medical decision level (reference point defining
immunity).
There is no significant constant bias, but there is a significant proportional
bias. This proportional bias of 67.8% is justified by bioMérieux as expected
because of the AxSYM being calibrated to the 2nd preparation of the rubella
International Standard whereas the VIDAS® is calibrated to the 3rd preparation
of the International Standard (i.e., 1st WHO International Standard, or RUBI-
1-94). Despite the bias, performance of the VIDAS® RUB IgG assay is
satisfactory and meets agreement requirements (see clinical studies
performance below).
b. Matrix comparison: N/A
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity: N/A
b. Clinical specificity: N/A
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Percent positive and percent negative agreement with a consensus comparator
method was determined as specified under Comparison Studies (see above).
A total of 1001 specimens were included in the original study. The trial
population consisted of 505 prospectively collected specimens (fresh and
frozen) and 496 retrospective specimens (frozen repository). The
prospectively collected specimens included 325 samples from pregnant
women and 180 samples from the general population. The general population
is defined here as predominantly adults for whom anti-rubella testing had been
ordered per clinical routine, excluding pregnant women. The retrospective
specimens consisted of 200 specimens from pregnant women and 296 samples
from the general population (as defined above).
Supplementary Study: Given the lack of statistical power to properly assess
the negative agreement in the pregnant women population using prospective
samples, an unbiased blinded test of 104 pre-selected additional pregnant
negative specimens and 25 pre-selected additional pregnant positive samples
was performed and analyzed following the same considerations mentioned
above.

CDC Performance Panel Results
A serum panel obtained from the CDC containing 100 samples, which consisted
of 50 pairs of duplicate samples titered by Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) were
evaluated. The sample pairs included 9 negative sera (representing 18 negative
samples), and 41 positive sera (representing 82 positive samples). The VIDAS®
RUB IgG assay identified 80/82 (97.6%) positive tests on 82 positive sera and
18/18 (100%) negative tests on 18 negative sera. One of the pairs of HI positive
sera was reported as VIDAS® equivocal (both results).
CDC Biological Standard Results
The CDC low-titer (commercialized at 21.0 IU/mL) anti-Rubella antibody human
standard was tested neatand at a ½ dilution as described in the CLSI® I/LA6-A
guideline. The mean result of the neat standard was 17.3 IU/mL. The mean result
of the two fold diluted standard was 8.0 IU/mL.
4. Clinical cut-off:
The clinical cut-off for immunity to infection with rubella virus has been
determined to be 10 IU/mL, as published in NCCLS I/L6-A, “Detection and
Quantitation of Rubella IgG Antibody: Evaluation and Performance Criteria for
Multiple Component Test Products, Specimen Handling, and Use of the Test
Products in the Clinical Laboratory”.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Reference Range:
below 5 IU/mL Negative
between =5 and <10 IU/mL Equivocal
equal to or above 10 IU/mL Positive
Expected Values
The VIDAS® RUB IgG assay was tested with 505 prospectively collected
specimens (fresh and frozen) representing subjects for whom rubella IgG testing
had been ordered per clinical routine. Of the 505 serum samples, 325
corresponded to pregnant women, and 180 samples corresponded predominantly
to non pregnant adults and contained 85.5% females and 14.5% males. The
distribution of results for IgG antibodies to rubella in these populations as
determined by the VIDAS® RUB IgG assay is summarized as follows:
