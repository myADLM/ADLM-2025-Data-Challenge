L. Test Principle:
The Roche Tina-quant Cystatin C test principle is a particle enhanced
immunoturbidimetric assay. Human cystatin C agglutinates with latex particles
coated with anti-cystatin C antibodies. The precipitate is determined
turbidimetrically. The signal generated is correlated with the concentration of cystatin
C in the sample. By interpolation on a standard curve, the concentration of cystatin C
in the sample is calculated.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All performance data was determined with the Hitachi 917 analyzer. Additional
information can be obtained from k041627.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision for the Tina-quant Cystatin C was conducted on the Hitachi 917
analyzer with a single lot and single instrument. Within run imprecision of
the Tina-quant Cystatin C test system was determined with two control
materials and two serum samples run in duplicates of 21. Between-day
imprecision was determined with two controls and two serum samples run in
triplicate (median value used). Total imprecision was determined with two
controls and two serum samples run once a day in triplicates for 21 days.
Results for the studies are shown in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was assessed via percent recovery of three serum samples (low,
medium and high levels) of different ranges of cystatin C concentrations.
Low and mid levels dilution series were prepared with human serum
containing low concentrations of cystatin C and saline as a diluent. The high
level dilution series were prepared using human serum spiked with Cystatin C
and saline as a diluent. Samples were diluted in 9 steps with saline and were
analyzed in with the Hitachi 917 analyzer. The sponsors acceptance criteria
for samples ranging from 0.40 to 1.00 mg/L is a recovery ≤ 0.20 mg/L and for
samples between 1.00 to 8.00 is a recovery ≤ 10%. The results are shown in
the tables below and support the sponsors claimed linear range of 0.40 to 8.0
mg/L.
The sponsor conducted a high dose (hook-effect) study to determine if high
does of cystatin C interfered with the assay. Human serum samples were

Traceability
There is no internationally recognized reference standard for Cystatin C. The
ready to use secondary calibrator materials are traceable to an in-house
gravimetric (dry-mass) reference preparation of delipidated human serum
enriched with recombinant human Cystatin C. The Cystatin C Control Set is
traceable to the Cfas Cystatin C Calibrator (secondary calibrator materials).
Value assignment
The Cystatin C Calibrator and Control Set value assignments were determined
by turbidimetry on the Hitachi 917. The reference preparation of pure
recombinant human Cystatin C was prepared and is used to value assign a
master calibrator or primary calibrators. The Primary calibrator is used to
assign the value of the secondary calibrator (Cfas Cystatin C). A daily
calibration curve is prepared from 6 dilutions of the master calibrator and of
the secondary calibrator. All dilutions are measure in duplicate. This is
repeated over 3 days and the final target value of the secondary calibrator is
the grand mean of all determinations for the value with the highest
concentration.
The Cystatin C Control Set is value assigned from the Cystatin C Calibrator
based on six calibrations. The grand mean value is used to value assign the
Cystatin C Control tested and the uncertainty for the grand mean is noted.
The control from another lot is measured in duplicates. The recommended
confidence interval for control accuracy is the assigned value +/- 15%.
Stability
Real-time stability for the C.f.a.s. Cystatin C and the Cystatin C Control set
were conducted for 25 months and the results support the sponsor’s shelf-life
claims of 24 months.
Closed reagent stability was assessed with three lots of the Cystatin C latex
reagent at day 0, month 2, 6,12,13,18, 24 and 25. The real-time stability
testing is still on-going and the results support the sponsor’s shelf-life claims
of 24 months.
On-board reagent stability was assessed and the results support the sponsor’s
open vial claims of 8 weeks when stored on-board or at 2-8oC.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined in
accordance with the CLSI EP17-A requirements.
The LoB study was conducted to determine the highest observed measurement
values for samples free of analyte. The LOB was determined as the 95th
percentile of measurements of bank samples. A blank sample was assayed on
two Hitachi 917 analyzers in six runs over 3 days per instrument for a total of
30 replicates. The LoB was determined to be ≤0.3 mg/L.
7

--- Page 8 ---
The LoD was conducted to determine the lower limit for samples with
analyte. The LoD was determined as the lowest amount of analyte in a
sample that can be detected with 95% probability. Five human serum samples
with low analyte were run on two Hitachi analyzers in six runs over 3 days per
instrument for a total of 25 replicates. The LoD was determined to be ≤0.4
mg/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Pooled human serum samples spiked with varying levels of interferent were
tested on the Hitachi 917 analyzer. The effects of interference by hemoglobin,
conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, lipemia (intralipid) and rheumatoid
factor were evaluated. The samples were tested in triplicate and the median
values were used to calculate recovery. The sponsor states that no significant
interference criterion is a recovery of +/-10% of the initial value. No
significant interference was found on the Hitachi 917 for hemoglobin up to
700 mg/dL, conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin up to 60 mg/dL, lipemia
up to an L index of 700 (corresponds to turbidity, however the sponsor states
in the labeling there is a poor correlation between L index and triglycerides)
and rheumatoid factor up to 1200 IU/mL.
Eighteen other compounds tested: Acetylsteine, ampicillin Na, ascorbic acid,
Ca-Dobesilate, Cefoxitin-Na, Liquemin Na-Heparin, Levodopa, L-a-
Methyldopa, Metronidazole, Phenylbutazone, Doxycycline HCl,
Acetylsalicylic acid, Rifampicine, Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen, theophylline
and cyclosporine were reported to have no significant interference or cross-
reactivity at low levels of cystatin C.
Hook effect was evaluated by testing high dose analyte concentrations up to
31 mg/L on the Hitachi 917 analyzer. There was no high dose hook effect up
to 20 mg/L. The sponsor states in the labeling that a high dose hook effect
may occur at cystatin C concentrations > 20 mg/L.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Ninety-four native human plasma (Li heparin) samples from a retrospective
collection of banked frozen samples, including multiple donors from both
hospitalized and healthy blood donors were measured with the DAKO
application (predicate device) on the Hitachi 917 (X) and with the Roche
Tina-quant Cystatin C (candidate device) on the Hitachi 917 (Y). The Roche
8

--- Page 9 ---
Tina-quant Cystatin C reagent is the same reagent as the DAKO Cystatin C
reagent. The samples ranged from 0.61 to 6.05 mg/L and the results were
calculated using the Passing/Bablock regression analysis. The correlation was
Y=1.009x+0.019 with a r2= 0.9991.
b. Matrix comparison:
An anticoagulation study was conducted to validate the use of Li-heparin
plasma with the Tina-quant Cystatin C assay. Forty six paired samples were
analyzed in singlicate on the Hitachi 917 and the concentrations ranged from
0.53 to 6.66 mg/L. Each plasma sample was compared to the respective
serum sample and the percent recovery was calculated. The sponsor’s
acceptance criterion was a deviation of less than 15%. The recoveries ranged
from 93.09 to 113.89% and support the use of Li-heparin samples for the
Roche Tina-quant Cystatin C assay.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor conducted a reference range study to determine the reference range
for the Tina-quant Cystatin C assay. Serum samples were measured in singlicate
on the Hitachi 917 analyzer. Samples were drawn from healthy, non-hospitalized
donors and the cystatin C results are shown in the table below.
