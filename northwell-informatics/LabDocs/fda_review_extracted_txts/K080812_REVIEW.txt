L. Test Principle:
Hemoccult ICT uses the principle of immunochromatography to detect human
hemoglobin from blood in fecal samples. The test requires a Collection Card and a Test
Device for each fecal sample. A portion of feces from two different areas of the stool is
applied in a thin smear to the Collection Card which serves as a means to transport the
sample to the testing site. The dried sample is transferred from the Collection Card to the
Test Device using a pull-out Sample Tab. Next it is rehydrated with buffer to extract the
hemoglobin, if present, from the sample. When the Test Device is closed, the sample is
brought into contact with the test strip which initiates chromatographic flow. The sample
flows down the test strip, rehydrates the colloidal gold anti-human hemoglobin antibody
conjugate and, if hemoglobin is present in the sample, forms a hemoglobin-conjugate
immune complex. The complex is then captured on the test strip in a zone containing
anti-human hemoglobin antibodies to form a visible Test Line - a positive test. No Test
Line forms in the absence of human hemoglobin in the sample - a negative test. Unbound
conjugate continues to migrate down the test strip and binds to the Control Line which
contains conjugate-specific antibodies.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision and reproducibility of Hemoccult® ICT was evaluated in blind
studies using Collection Cards smeared with fecal samples spiked with a
range of blood levels to give negative, borderline positive and positive test
results. The precision study was performed by three technicians, working
independently in the same laboratory, who tested each sample 10 times. The
agreement was 100% (90/90). The reproducibility study was performed by
three individual technicians, working in three geographically separate
locations, who tested each sample 10 times. The reproducibility was 97%
(30/30 for the negative samples, 30/30 for the positive samples, and 27/30 for
the borderline samples)
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
N/A
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Internal Quality Control: The test device contains built-in procedural controls
including a positive Control Line and a negative background control area on
the control strip. A test is valid when the built-in procedural controls perform
4

--- Page 5 ---
as indicated, assuring that the test device and buffer reagents are functioning
properly and that the procedure has been performed correctly.
External Quality Control: Positive and negative controls are available. When
running the test device for the first time, it is recommend that external controls
be tested and the correct results obtained before proceeding to patient samples.
d. Detection limit:
In vitro studies, following the recommend procedures for sample collection
and storage, demonstrated that 95% of the time Hemoccult® ICT detected 0.2
mL of added blood per 100g of feces ( 1 mL of blood/100g feces is on average
1.5 mg Hb/g feces). Hemoccult® ICT also reliably detected blood levels up
to 17 mL per 100g of feces.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross Reactivity
Hemoccult® ICT was examined in vitro by spiking fecal samples with
myoglobin from horse and hemoglobin from beef, chicken, fish, horse,
pig, rabbit, goat, sheep and turkey, to determine whether dietary substances
cross reacted with the test. Spiked fecal samples were incubated at 37°C for
24 hours prior to testing to mimic the transit time in the colon. Hemoccult®
ICT gave negative test results when tested with these substances at a
concentration of 5 mg/g feces, a level in excess of normal dietary intake which
consistently gave false-positive results with guaiac-based tests.
Effect of Diet
Hemoccult® ICT does not require the patient to follow any special
dietary restrictions. Fecal samples from different individuals werespiked with
25 mg/g feces of horseradish peroxidase and 25 mg/gfeces of ferrous sulfate
to check for possible false-positive test results,and with a mixture of 25 mg/g
feces vitamin C and 5 mg/g feces of human hemoglobin to check for possible
false-negative test results. These studies demonstrated that Hemoccult® ICT
was not affected by abnormally high concentrations of substances shown to
cause false-positive or false-negative results with guaiac-based tests.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The candidate device is exactly the same as the predicate device. The sponsor
is requesting revision of the labeling to separate the results for 1, 2 and 3 days
of testing rather than 3 days combined alone. Results from the comparison to
the original predicate device (Hemoccult®) are presented below in the
Clinical Studies section.
b. Matrix comparison:
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Average Risk Screening Population
The test positivity rate, estimated positive predictive value, relative
sensitivity, and false positivity rate for lower GI pathology, based on the
detection of bleeding, was evaluated using Hemoccult® ICT and Hemoccult®
in a group of 1734 asymptomatic, average risk individuals following the usual
dietary restrictions for guaiac-based tests for 3 days of testing combined.
Individuals with a positive result on Hemoccult® or Hemoccult® ICT were
scheduled for follow-up colonoscopy to confirm the presence or absence of
any lower GI pathology. Patients who were negative by both fecal occult
blood tests were “presumed” to be negative for lower GI pathology. The test
positivity rates for multi-day screening were 1.8% (32/1734) for Hemoccult®
ICT and 2.9% (51/1734) for Hemoccult®. In order to estimate the sensitivity,
positive predictive value, and false positivity rate, the results obtained were
independently compared directly to clinical pathology findings. As expected
in an average risk screening population, few cases of colorectal neoplasia
were found. For multi day screening the sensitivity for colorectal neoplasia
was 100% (5/5) for Hemoccult® ICT and 40% (2/5) for Hemoccult®. The
estimated positive predictive value for colorectal neoplasia was 15.6% (5/32)
for Hemoccult® ICT and 3.9% (2/51) for Hemoccult®. The false positivity
rate for other GI pathology was 0.9% (15/1681) for Hemoccult® ICT and
1.2% (20/1681) for Hemoccult®. The apparent specificity was 99.1% for
Hemoccult® ICT and 98.8% for Hemoccult®.

Clinical Sensitivity in a High Risk Population
High risk patients with a personal or family history of colorectal neoplasia and/or
physical signs or symptoms suggestive of lower GI disorders were recruited for a
study designed to evaluate fecal occult blood tests relative to clinical pathology. A
diagnostic work-up was performed on all patients using either colonoscopy or a
combination of flexible sigmoidoscopy and double contrast barium x-ray. A
clinical diagnosis based on endoscopy was made for each patient and compared
to test results.
A comparison of Hemoccult® ICT and Hemoccult® versus clinical diagnosis of
colorectal neoplasia was completed for 45 patients. The clinical sensitivity of
Hemoccult® ICT and Hemoccult® for colorectal cancer was 90% (18/20); the
clinical sensitivity of Hemoccult® ICT for large adenomas was 28% (7/25) and
for Hemoccult® was 20% (5/25). The clinical sensitivity of Hemoccult® ICT for
colorectal neoplasia (cancers and large adenomas combined) was 56% (25/45)
and for Hemoccult® was 51% (23/45).
To evaluate the performance of Hemoccult® ICT and HemeSelect® (reference
immunochemical test) versus clinical diagnosis of colorectal neoplasia, a study
was completed with 53 patients. Hemoccult® ICT and HemeSelect® had a
clinical sensitivity for colorectal cancer of 90% (27/30); Hemoccult® ICT had a
clinical sensitivity of 30% (7/23) for large adenomas, and HemeSelect® had a
clinical sensitivity of 26% (6/23) for large adenomas. The clinical sensitivity for
colorectal neoplasia (cancers and large adenomas combined) was 64% (34/53) for
Hemoccult® ICT and 62% (33/53) for HemeSelect®.
