K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI EP5-T2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices;
L. Test Principle:
The A/C Portable Enzymatic Homocysteine (HCY) Assay measures total homocysteine
(tHCY) in plasma and serum. The principle of the assay is that tHCY is degraded by
Homocysteinase (rHCYase) and produces hydrogen sulfide (H S), which is measured using
2
N,N-dibutyl phenylene diamine (DBPDA), the combination of which forms a chromophore.
After oxidation, the A/C Diagnostics Reader, a fluorescence reader is used to obtain the
tHCY values.
The A/C Portable Enzymatic Homocysteine Assay is a manual assay with the results read by
the A/C Diagnostics Reader. Five μL of EDTA plasma is used in a dithiothreitol reduction
reaction for 60 minutes to release bound homocysteine. The rHCYase reaction is then run for
5 minutes. The DBPDA chromophore is then added and one minute later an oxidant,
potassium ferricyanide, is added. Ten minutes later, the end-points are read at Em Ex
710 nm/ 660

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the assay on the A/C Diagnostics Reader was evaluated in a study
based on CLSI EP5-T2 guidelines “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical
Chemistry Devices.” In this study, precision was determined after analyzing three
plasma samples containing low, medium and high tHCY in parallel assays. The
within-assay precision was determined from results from 10 parallel analytical set-
ups. The between-assay precision was calculated in 10 successive assays carried out
over 10 days. The CVs, shown in the table below, for within-assay and between-assay
were less than 5% and 10%, respectively.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Five plasma samples containing different levels of homocysteine (3.2-44.6 μmol/L)
were measured by the A/C Portable Enzymatic HCY Assay on the A/C Diagnostics
Reader. The data demonstrated linearity of the assay up to 43.8 μmol/L with the
regression equation of y = 0.9536x + 0.5963, R2 = 0.9969. The studies support the
stated measuring range of the assay of 4.1 to 43.8 μmol/L.
A recovery study was performed in which one sample with tHCY a concentration of
45.0 μmol/L was serially diluted 2, 4 and 8 times. The samples were analyzed by the
Portable A/C Enzymatic HCY Assay in 10 replicates in a single run. The average %
recoveries ranged from 91 to 104 %.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators and Controls were prepared by spiking homocysteine into a plasma
matrix. The plasma matrix was manufactured from material such that each donor unit
was tested by an FDA approved method for the presence of antibody to HIV-1/2,
antibody to HCV, as well as for the Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HbsAg), and found
to be negative. An HPLC method was used for the value determination of Calibrators
and Controls for the A/C Enzymatic Homocysteine Assay. Calibrators and controls
are stated to be stable for 24 hours at 25 ºC, 2 months at 4 ºC and 2 years at -20 ºC.
The stability was determined by testing the vials stored at different temperatures for
certain periods compared with the standard in the Portable A/C Enzymatic HCY
Assay. Calibrators and controls are supplied with the kit.
c. Detection limit:
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) is used as the low detection limit of the assay.
The limit of quantitation was defined as the lowest concentration having a CV <20%.

The results demonstrate that the LoQ of the A/C Portable Enzymatic
HCY Assay on the A/C Diagnostics Reader is 3.7 μmol/L. The sponsor has
established the measuring range of the assay as from 4.1 to 43.8 μmol/L (see Section
b. Linearity).
d. Analytical specificity:
To study the effect of bilirubin, plasma samples with tHCY levels of 5.7 and 14.8
μmol/L were spiked with bilirubin to achieve bilirubin levels of12.5, 25 and 50
mg/dL.The samples were analyzed in quadruplicate by the assay. The results
demonstrate that bilirubin concentrations of up to 50 mg/dL show < 10% interference
and therefore, do not interfere with the measurement of tHCY by the assay.
Interference from glycerol was studied using plasma samples with tHCY levels of 6.8
and 11.6 μmol/L which were spiked with glycerol to achieve levels of 1,250, 2,500
and 5,000 mg/dL. The results demonstrated that glycerol concentrations of up to 5000
mg/dL show < 10% interference and therefore, do not interfere with the measurement
of tHCY by the assay. In addition, plasma samples with tHCY levels of 6.8 and 11.6
μmol/L spiked with a commercially available lipid mixture containing 450 mg/dL
showed < 10% interference. To study the effect of hemoglobin plasma samples with
5.5 and 14.6 μmol/L tHCY were spiked with hemoglobin to achieve hemoglobin
levels of 0.25 g/L, 0.5 g/L and 1.0 g/L. The results demonstrate that hemoglobin
concentrations of up to 1.0 mg/mL (1.0 g/L) show < 10% interference and therefore,
do not interfere with the measurement of tHCY by the assay.
Cross reactivity was tested and is < 10% for cystathione (up to 500 μmol/L), L-
cysteine (up to 200 μmol/L), methionine (up to 0.2 mol/L) and glutathione (up to 0.5
μmol/L).
Other Limitations
Specimens from patients who are on drug therapy involving S-adenosyl methionine
may show falsely elevated levels of homocysteine. Specimens from patients taking
methotrexate, carbamazepine, phenytoin, nitrous oxide or 6-azauridine triacetate may
have elevated levels due to their effect on the methionine-homocysteine metabolic
pathway.

Reader and the A/C Automatic Enzymatic HCY Assay on the Hitachi 912 Automatic
Analyzer (predicate device). The comparison yielded a regression equation of y =
1.0098x + 0.9124, r2 = 0.946
b. Matrix comparison:
Samples collected from 10 donors were immediately separated into three different
vacutainers, one without additive, one containing K –EDTA and one containing

homocysteine into 6 samples to prepare a total of 16 samples. Total HCY values of
the samples were measured by the A/C Portable Enzymatic HCY Assay on the A/C
Diagnostics Reader. The results are shown in the table below.
