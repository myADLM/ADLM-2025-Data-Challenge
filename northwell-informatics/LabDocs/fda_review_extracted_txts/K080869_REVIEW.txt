K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): NA
L. Test Principle: The Access Toxo IgG assay is an enzyme immunoassay using an
indirect technique. A sample is added to a reaction vessel with paramagnetic particles
coated with Toxoplasma gondii membrane antigen. Specific antibodies present in the
sample bind to the antigen. After incubation in a reaction vessel, materials bound to the
solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away.
Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated monoclonal anti-human IgG antibody is then added and
attaches to the IgG antibodies captured on the particles. A second separation and wash
step removes unbound conjugate. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phos* 530
is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer.
The light production is directly proportional to the concentration of Toxo IgG antibody in
the sample. The amount of analyte in the sample is determined from a stored, multi-point
calibration curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility: Reproducibility/repeatability of the Access Toxo IgG
Assay was estimated at one internal (Site 3) and two external sites (Sites 1 and 2). Each
site performed one run per day over seven test days. Nine serum samples were run in
replicates of five in each run. Combined results for each serum sample from all three sites
are presented in the table below. The observed average total %CV was 12.6% with daily
calibration and 15.3% using a stored calibration.

Linearity with High Patient Samples: Four highly reactive sera were diluted from
1/1.5 to 1/32 in Access Toxo IgG Calibrator, S0. These dilutions were tested in
quadruplicate and the results were compared to expected values based on the neat
sample determination (eight replicates). The mean recovery for the four sera was
100% and ranged from 93.8% to 109.1%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Access Toxo Calibrators(A31589): The Access Toxo calibrators are traceable to the
WHO 3rd Internationable Standard Preparation for Anti-Toxoplasma Serum (TOXM)
based on EN ISO 17511. The calibrators are provided at six levels- zero(S0), and
approximately 10.5 (S1), 50 (S2), 120(S3), 240(S4), and 450(S5) IU/mL. The
recommended open use life of the Calibrators is 90 days.
Access Toxo Quality Controls(A31590): There are two controls: 1) QC1- Pooled
human defibrinated plasma negative (non-reactive) for anti-T.gondii IgG; 2) QC2-
Spiked human defibrinated plasma containing high levels of anti-T.gondii IgG
positive (reactive). The target range for QC1 is <2 IU/mL; the target range for QC2 is
20-30 IU/mL. The recommended open use life of the Controls is 90 days.
d. Analytical sensitivity:
(i) Limit of Blank (LoB): The LoB was determined with three serum samples in 60
replicates (level of anti-Toxoplasma IgG approaching 0 IU/mL in each serum sample)
and one lot of the S0 calibrator with two lots of Access Toxo IgG reagents (P1 and
P2). The testing was conducted with one Access and one Access 2 Analyzer. The

LoB for the Access Toxo IgG is estimated at 0.10 IU/mL.
(ii) Limit of Detection (LoD): Four low level (non-reactive) serum samples were
tested in 60 replicates with two reagent lots. The testing was conducted with one
Access and one Access 2 Analyzer. The LoD for the Access Toxo IgG is estimated at
0.40 IU/mL.
(iii) Limit of Quantiation (LoQ): To estimate the LoQ for the Access Toxo IgG, two
samples with established levels of anti-Toxoplasma IgG reactivity was tested over 5
days in one run of 5 replicates per day. The testing was conducted with two reagent
lots on a single Access Analyzer. The mean LoQ for the Access Toxo IgG is 3.2
IU/mL.
e. Analytical specificity/Interference: A study was conducted to investigate potential
cross-reactivity with immunoglobulins resulting from exposure to other infectious
agents that can produce symptoms similar to Toxoplasma infection (CMV, Epstein-
Barr virus, HIV, HSV-1, HSV-2, malaria, measles, rubella VZV, mumps and
Treponema). In addition, interference due to heterophilic antibodies (HAMA),
abnormal immune system conditions (myeloma, rheumatoid factor, ANA) and
influenza vaccine was evaluated. A total of 311 samples were tested. Nine samples
(2.9%, including HIV, HSV-2 IgG, HAMA, mumps, syphilis) that were non-reactive
by another commercially available assay were equivocal or reactive in the Access
Toxo IgG Assay. The observed performance with each condition is presented in the
following Table:

The Access Toxo IgG Assay was not significantly affected by the presence of 300 mg/L
bilirubin (100 mg/L free + 200 mg/L conjugated), 30 g/L triolein (triglycerides), 90 g/L
albumin or 20 g/L hemoglobin.
f. Assay cut-off: The assay cutoff was established by an evaluation of 959 non-
reactive and 1091 reactive samples characterized by another enzyme immunoassay
method. Cutoff for the Access Toxo IgG assay was determined to be 10.5 IU/mL based
on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.
• All test samples < 7.5 IU/mL are considered non-reactive for the presence of
Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibodies.
• Sample results ≥ 7.5 IU/mL and < 10.5 IU/mL are considered equivocal for
the presence of Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibodies.
• All test samples ≥ 10.5 IU/mL are considered reactive for the presence of T.
gondii IgG antibodies.

Performance Characteristics
Summary of Clinical Studies
Method Comparison: Studies comparing the performance of the Access Toxo IgG assay
with the Abbott AxSYM Toxo IgG method were conducted at one external site in south-
central France (Site 1), one external site in the northeastern United States (Site 2) and at
the manufacturer’s site (Site 3). The external sites tested samples collected from their
own routine prenatal screening population as well as specimens from males and non-
pregnant females that had Toxo IgG testing ordered. Two clinical sample suppliers
provided the routine Toxo IgG test specimens for the U.S. site. The manufacturer tested
prenatal specimens collected at three hospitals in north-central France.
Method agreement results for the prospective (fresh) and retrospective (frozen)
collections by test site are presented in the following two Tables.

CDC Toxoplasma 1998 Human Serum Panel
The Access Toxo IgG Assay exhibited 100% positive and negative agreement with the
100-member CDC Toxoplasma 1998 Human Serum Panel.
4. Clinical cut-off: As described in Assay cut-off.
5. Expected values/Reference range: The worldwide prevalence of Toxoplasma
infection varies widely, influenced by such factors as environmental conditions,
sanitation, dietary practices and companion and farm animal contact. Local prevalence is
also influenced by population age and immigration patterns. Published estimates of
seroprevalence for selected population in Europe, Asia, Africa and south America range
from <5 -90% while a recent study estimate the overall United States prevalence to be
approximately 22%.
Due to this substantial variability, it was recommended to establish prevalence
expectations based on its own specific patient population.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion: The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and
supports a substantial equivalence decision. The Access Toxo IgG Assay, Calibrators
and QC (Part numbers: A31588, A31589, A31590) on the Access Immunoassay
Systems are substantially equivalent to the AxSYM Toxo IgG Assay and the Access
Toxo IgG Assay, Calibrators and QC (Part numbers: 34450, 34455, 34459) for the
quantitative and qualitative determination of IgG antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii in
human serum.
