H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Pathwork® Tissue of Origin Test is intended to measure the degree of similarity
between the RNA expression pattern in a patient’s fresh-frozen tumor and the RNA
expression patterns in a database of tumor samples (poorly differentiated,
undifferentiated and metastatic cases) that were diagnosed according to then current
clinical and pathological practice. The database contains examples of RNA expression
patterns for fifteen common malignant tumor types: bladder, breast, colorectal, gastric,
hepatocellular, kidney, non-small cell lung, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, and thyroid
carcinomas, melanoma, testicular germ cell tumor, non-Hodgkins lymphoma (not
otherwise specified), and soft tissue sarcoma (not otherwise specified). The Pathwork®
Tissue of Origin Test result is intended for use in the context of the patient’s clinical
history and other diagnostic tests evaluated by a qualified clinician.
Limitations: The Pathwork® Tissue of Origin Test is not intended to establish the origin
of tumors (e.g. carcinoma of unknown primary) that cannot be diagnosed according to
current clinical and pathological practice. It is not intended to subclassify or modify the
classification of tumors that can be diagnosed by current clinical and pathological
practice, nor to predict disease course or survival or treatment efficacy, nor to distinguish
primary from metastatic tumor. Tumor types not in the Pathwork® Tissue of Origin Test
database may have RNA expression patterns that are similar to patterns in the database.
Therefore, results cannot be used to distinguish tumor types in the database from tumor

4. Special instrument requirements:
Affymetrix GeneChip® Microarray Instrumentation System (k080995)
I. Device Description:
The Pathwork® Tissue of Origin Test is a test kit consists of the Pathchip microarray,
reagents, software, Pathwork Specimen Processing Guide and Guide to Report Interpretation
(GRI).
The Pathchip is a custom-designed microarray manufactured by Affymetrix, Inc. (Santa
Clara, CA) per Pathwork design requirements and functions in a manner similar to GeneChip
HG-U133A. The Pathchip has over 500,000 unique oligonucleotide features (18-micron in
size), covering over 18,400 transcript variants (across 22,300 probesets) which in turn
represent 14,500 of the best characterized human genes. Each transcript is represented by a
probeset, comprised of 11-16 pairs of oligonucleotide probes. The probesets are spatially
distributed over the array and are used to measure the level of transcription of each sequence
represented on the array. For each array, there are 1550 probesets representing 1550 human
genes which are used by the Tissue of Origin Test algorithm as markers to identify the tissue
of origin of the specimen being tested. These probesets were selected using machine
learning methods and each set has between 11 and 16 probe pairs of 25 bases whose
sequences are matched to mRNA species that are found in human tissue. In addition, the
array has 121 probesets that are used for normalization and data verification.
The algorithm of the Pathwork® Tissue of Origin Test was developed using a database of
2039 specimens, divided into independent training and test datasets. The test development
used a machine learning approach based on marker selection to build a predictive model.
The model consists of a list of markers, a set of reference (support) samples and a set of
coefficients. These components are combined to produce 15 Similarity Scores, one for each
of the possible tissues on the test panel. Each similarity score ranges from 0 to 100, with a
higher score being associated with a higher likelihood that the input specimen has a
molecular signature of the corresponding tissue of origin. The 15 similarity scores are scaled
to sum up to 100. Each is based on the microarray standardized expression (SE) values of
selected biomarkers. The process consists of the following steps:
1. Read SE values for the biomarkers used in the Tissue of Origin Test from the input file.
2. Compute a decision function (“score”) for each of 105 possible pairings of the 15 tissues
on the test panel with respect to the sample described by the input SE values.
3. Convert the 105 pairwise scores into pairwise probabilities.
4. Reduce the 105 pairwise probabilities to 15 Similarity Scores, one for each Tissue of
Origin. These are the final 15 Similarity Scores presented in the Tissue of Origin Test
Report.
The Pathwork Specimen Processing Guide contains instructions for the user to process tissue
specimens in the manner specimens were processed during the clinical validation of the

L. Test Principle:
The specimen used for the Pathwork® Tissue of Origin Test is a snap-frozen surgical sample.
Prior to processing for the TOO test, the user must ensure that the biopsy specimen is no less
than 100 mg in mass, and contains at least 60% tumor and no more than 20% necrosis. The
tissue must be homogenized and total RNA must be isolated per the Pathwork Specimen
Processing Guide. One microgram of total RNA is required to perform the TISSUE OF
ORIGINtest. The procedural steps after isolation of total RNA from the specimen are:
reverse transcription of total RNA; first and second strand cDNA synthesis; cDNA
purification; cRNA synthesis and biotinylation; purification and fragmentation of the labeled
cRNA; hybridization of the biotin-labeled cRNA target to the Pathchip microarray; washing
and scanning of the hybridized Pathchip microarray; data acquisition (signal intensity per
feature), data verification, standardization of the signal intensities; determination of similarity
to 15 tissues of origin and generation of the Report.
The scanned data file from each laboratory is transported from the Affymetrix Workstation
with GeneChip® Operating System (GCOSDx) for analysis using the Pathwork System
Software through a secure FTP transfer protocol. The Pathwork system software converts
the scanned image data to gene expression measurements, performs the data verification,
normalizes (standardizes) the data to correct for technical sources of variation, performs a
series of multiplex statistical tests, and produces a report summarizing these results. Each
specimen analyzed will produce 15 similarity scores, one for each tissue on the panel. Each
similarity score is a measure of the similarity of the gene expression profile of the specimen
to the profile of the indicated tissue, ranging from 0 (very low similarity) to 100 (very high
similarity). Similarity scores for all 15 tissues necessarily sum up to 100. For each Tissue of
Origin test performed, a test report is generated that quantifies the similarity of the RNA
expression pattern found in a tumor specimen (poorly or un-differentiated primary tumors, as
well as metastatic tumors) to expression patterns found in tumor specimens from 15 known
tissues of origin and provided to the laboratory over a secure internet connection in pdf
format. Clinical laboratory customers are expected to use the resulting report in either its
printed or electronic form for incorporation into the Surgical Pathology Report delivered to
the requesting physician by the laboratory.
The report quantifies the similarity of a poorly differentiated, undifferentiated or metastatic
tumor specimen to 15 cancers of known tissue of origin, for interpretation by the clinician.
The report presents 15 computed Similarity Scores in a graphical format, one for each tissue
on the test panel. The ordering physician interprets the Pathwork® Tissue of Origin Test
using the Guide to Report Interpretation (GRI) which is provided as a component of the
report directly below the results for Similarity Scores. The Guide to Report Interpretation
requires the physician to use knowledge of the location of the tumor biopsy site to correctly
interpret the report.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Replicate samples from 60 individual tumors were distributed among the four
laboratories for a total of 234 tissue samples (Site 2 and 4 did not receive samples
from gastric tumors due to insufficient tumor volume). Of the 60 specimens, 46
(77%) were metastases and 14 (23%) were primaries classified as poorly
4

--- Page 5 ---
differentiated to undifferentiated. This study required each laboratory to perform the
full protocol from frozen tissue, which had been subjected to the additional handling
and transport required to aliquot a frozen tissue specimen. Five tumor tissue types
(breast, colorectal, non-small-cell lung, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and pancreas)
were represented by six specimens each and all other tissue types (bladder, gastric,
germ cell, hepatocellular, kidney, melanoma, ovarian, prostate, soft tissue sarcoma
and thyroid) were represented by three specimens each. The study was published in
Journal of Molecular Diagnostics, Volume 10, Number 1, January 2008, pp 67-77.
Specimens with < 60% viable tumor or > 20% necrosis were excluded from the
analyses and the resulting performance characteristics. A total of 206 tissue samples
met this inclusion criterion. Fourteen (14) of the 206 samples (6.8%) admitted to the
study failed one of the Quality Control steps. Five samples (2.4%) across two sites
failed to yield sufficient total RNA, (a minimum of 1 μg is required), and were
unavailable for further processing. Nine specimens (4.4%) across three sites failed
the data verification test, reporting Low Overall Signal when analyzed by the
Pathwork System Software. A total of 192 of the 206 samples (93.2%) admitted to
the study met all Quality Control criteria.
Processing was performed by a different operator at each site, and was performed in
batches, extending over a 2 to 5 week period. Matched pairs of specimens which
were successfully processed at both sites were evaluated using linear regression and
correlation analysis to evaluate the reproducibility of the underlying Standardized
Expression values of the markers used in the test.
In this analysis, concordance was strictly defined as an identical Pathwork test result
between two laboratory sites for a paired specimen. (An indeterminate result was
concordant only with another indeterminate result at the second lab.) The Pathwork
test result was obtained by applying the Guide to Report Interpretation (see Dumar et
al. for details). Across all four laboratories, six pair-wise comparisons showed slopes
of 0.87 to 0.92 and “r” of 0.84 to 0.90

was tested at the four sites as noted and, for each specimen, an average of the
Similarity Scores associated with the actual tissue of origin was calculated, along
with standard deviation and percent coefficient of variation (%CV). For each
Similarity Score range shown below, the observed average standard deviation and
average %CV results are provided. Reproducibility of the test is shown in bold for
similarity scores between 20-40, because this interval includes 30, the cut-off given in

*Each specimen was tested as n = 4 (Sites 1-4). Missing replicates are due to depleted aliquots, insufficient yields, or
data verification errors (low overall signal).
To assess the accuracy of the results reported by each laboratory, the Physician
Guided Conclusions were compared to available diagnosis established for each
specimen. Each laboratory was expected to achieve the overall acceptance criteria of
at least 80% agreement with the available diagnosis, with no more than 10% non-
agreement. As can be seen in the table below, all four laboratories achieved the
criteria, with Site 2 as the poorest performer with 87.8% agreement. No laboratory
reported more than 5% non-agreement.

2) Amount of fragmented, labeled cRNA used for hybridization to Pathchip
microarrays: 10 μg.
To ensure that a sufficient quantity of high quality labeled cRNA is obtained for
hybridization to Pathchip microarrays, it is recommended that:
1) All procedures in the Pathwork Specimen Processing Guide are followed
efficiently to reduce RNase degradation.
2) No more than 60 minutes between excision and freezing of the biopsy specimen.
3) A minimum of 100 mg tissue be used as starting material for extraction of total
RNA.
4) Biopsy specimen should contain at least 60% tumor and no more than 20%
necrosis
5) Absorbance measurements of total RNA give an A260/A280 ratio of at least 1.7.
6) Amount of labeled cRNA used for fragmentation: minimum of 15 μg.
Endogenous Pathchip Controls:
In addition to these external controls, the Pathwork Tissue of Origin test utilizes
endogenous mRNA markers that are found in human tissue specimens and are
captured on the Pathchip microarray to perform a series of data verifications that
detect laboratory processing anomalies found to unfavorably influence the accuracy
of the Pathwork Tissue of Origin test. These data verifications include the detection
of regional discontinuities and low overall signal. When a submitted file fails one or
more of the data verifications, the system software will return a Tissue of Origin Test
Report flagged as follows: "The gene expression data file submitted failed data
verification. This can be caused by a poor quality specimen or an error in laboratory
processing. Specifics shown in CAUTION below.”
Device stability: The shelf life of Pathchip is one year from the date of manufacture
when stored at 2º C to 8ºC.
d. Detection limit:
Dilution study _ Labeled cRNA:
Dilution study was performed to demonstrate that the Tissue of Origin test is robust
against reasonable variations in the amount of labeled cRNA used in hybridization.
The study used 15 different frozen human tissue (FHT) specimens, three (3) each
from breast, colorectal, lung, lymphoma and pancreas tissues of origin. RNA was
extracted and processed to the point of labeled cRNA. For each specimen, Pathchip
arrays were hybridized with each of the five dilutions (20, 15, 10, 7.5 and 5 μg) of
labeled cRNA. Subsequent processing of all 15 specimens x 5 dilutions (= 75 arrays)
were performed per the recommended protocol. Four samples from one specimen
were excluded because of low data verification values. The data was analyzed using
linear regression and correlation analysis to assess equivalence. Based on the data,
the Tissue of Origin Test User Guide specifies 10 ± 2 μg cRNA.
e. Analytical specificity:
Several potential interfering substances in tumor biopsy were evaluated for potential
adverse effects.
Adipose Tissue: To examine whether the adipose tissue in breast tumors is a
7

--- Page 8 ---
potential interferrent and produce adverse effects in the Tissue of Origin test,
Physician Guided Conclusion (PGC) from 69 breast-related specimens included in the
clinical validation were compared to its available clinical diagnosis. Available
clinical diagnosis from Breast-related specimens were in 94.2% agreement with PGC,
compared to all specimens which had 87.8% agreement.
RNases: To examine whether RNases in pancreas tumors produce adverse effects in
Tissue of Origin test, the results from FHT biopsy specimens were stratified to
evaluate pancreatic tumors for RNases interference. The clinical validation included
25 pancreas-related specimens. Available clinical diagnoses from pancreas-related
specimens were in 72% agreement with PGC, compared to all specimens which had
87.8% agreement. Since there is a lower performance than for all the other
specimens, this is cited under Limitations in the user guide.
Fibrous material: To examine whether fibrous material in skin-related specimens,
produce adverse effects in the Tissue of Origin Test, the results from FHT biopsy
specimens used in the clinical validation were stratified to evaluate the effect from
melanomas and skin-related biopsies. The clinical validation included 27 skin-related
specimens. Available clinical diagnoses from skin-related specimens were in 81.5%
agreement with PGC, compared to all specimens which had 87.8% agreement.
Tissue of Origin Test does not demonstrate apparent adverse effects with this
interfering substance.
Necrotic tissue: To examine whether necrotic tissue produce adverse effects in use
of the Tissue of Origin Test, the results from the FHT biopsy specimens used in the
clinical validation study were stratified by percent necrosis. Based on the %
agreement, a cut-off of 20% necrosis or less is recommended as a quality control
measure for biopsy specimen inclusion criteria for this test.
f. Assay cut-off:
Guide to Report Interpretation:
The Similarity Score (SS) is a measure of the similarity of the RNA expression
pattern of the specimen to the RNA expression pattern of the indicated tissue.
Similarity Scores range from 0 (very low similarity) to 100 (very high similarity) and
sum to 100 across all 15 tissues on the panel.
SS ≥ 30: A single SS greater than or equal to 30 indicates the likely tissue of origin.
If two or three SS’s are greater than or equal to 30, then one of those results indicates
the likely tissue of origin.
5 < SS < 30: If every SS is between 5 and 30, then the test result is
indeterminate and no tissue of origin is indicated.
SS ≤ 5: An SS less than or equal to 5 rules out that tissue type as the likely tissue
of origin.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with available diagnosis:
The clinical validation involved a total of four different processing sites. The study
included 25 to 69 samples per tissue on the panel, with an average of 36 specimens
8

--- Page 9 ---
per tissue. The specimens included poorly differentiated, undifferentiated and
metastatic tumor specimens. Of the total 659 tumor specimens processed in this
study, 545 specimens met the labeling limitations for tumor grade and available
diagnosis and passed the data verification quality tests.
To assess the accuracy of the results reported by each laboratory, the Physician
Guided Conclusions were compared to available diagnosis established for each
specimen. Based on the n = 545 results, the probability that a true positive tissue call
was obtained when a Similarity Score of ≥ 30 was reported was 92.9%, 95% CI [90.3,
95.0], and the probability that a true negative tissue call was obtained when a
Similarity Score of ≤ 5 was reported was 99.7%, 95% CI [99.6, 99.8]. Each
laboratory was expected to achieve the overall acceptance criteria of at least 80%
agreement with the available diagnosis, with no more than 10% non-agreement.
The detailed results are presented in Tables 4 – 7.
Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) –100*TP/POS, where TP is the number of test
results that match the available diagnoses for the given tissue of origin and POS is the
total number of positive specimens as per available diagnosis for the given tissue of
origin.
Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) – 100*(1-(FP/NEG)), where FP is the number
of test results that are false positive (as per the available diagnoses) for the given
tissue of origin and NEG is the number of negative specimens as per the available
diagnosis for the given tissue of origin.
Non-Agreement (%) – the percent of POS specimens in which the Pathwork test
result does not agree with the available diagnosis and is not indeterminate.
Indeterminate (%) – the percent of POS specimens in which the Pathwork test result
is indeterminate.
Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) – is the size of the area under the Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC curve for the Tissue of Origin Test
is obtained by plotting PPA/100 (i.e., sensitivity) vs. one minus NPA/100 (i.e., one
minus specificity) for different values of the Similarity Score cut-off. (AUC ranges
from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.5 is achievable by a random test and 1.0 indicates perfect
agreement).

*As described in the Guide to Report Interpretation, if two or three SS are greater
than or equal to 30, then one of those results indicates the likely tissue of origin. In
the clinical validation study, this occurred in 11 of 545 specimens or 2%.
In Table 4 above, if one of the two SS was the tissue of origin, this was
counted as an agreement. In Table 5 below, this was counted as a non-
agreement due to presence of a second tissue (non-agreement). Note that for
each of the eleven specimens, one of the two SS ≥ 30 did, indeed, correspond
to the actual tissue of origin.

b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not examined because a reference standard defining diagnostic truth was not
considered for the clinical studies. Instead, positive percent agreement with the
available diagnosis was considered (Tables 4 and 5).
Clinical specificity:
Not examined because a reference standard defining diagnostic truth was not
considered for the clinical studies. Instead, negative percent agreement with the
available diagnosis was considered (Tables 4 and 5).
b. Performance of the Tissue of Origin Test for Off-Panel Specimens
Tissue specimens that are off-panel (i.e. not one of the fifteen tissues on the Tissue of
Origin Test panel) were assessed for similarity in RNA expression pattern with one of
the 15 tissues on the panel.
A review of published sources and interviews with practitioners were conducted to
identify the cancers not included in the 15 tissues on the Pathwork Tissue of Origin
(TOO) test panel that should be evaluated in this study. Criteria for selection

included:
• Commonly known to metastasize
• Challenging or difficult to diagnose
• Likely to present as an uncertain primary cancer
This review selected the following: cancer of the uterine cervix, endometrium,
esophagus, small cell lung, and squamous cell carcinoma of the head & neck. The
study involved 143 off-panel tissue specimens from uterine cervix (n = 42),
endometrium (n = 49), esophagus (n = 28), small cell carcinoma of lung (n = 4),
ovarian germ cell (n=2), and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (Sq.
Head & Neck; n = 18).
Results:
Table 8 shows the performance of the Tissue of Origin (TOO) test for tissue
specimens that are “off-panel” (i.e. not one of the fifteen tissues on the Tissue of
Origin Test panel). For off-panel cancers, a similarity score >= 30 for a cancer on
panel indicates a false positive association with that cancer, according to the Guide to
Report Interpretation. For each off-panel tissue type, a high false positive percentage
was observed, especially endometrial cancer with ovarian cancer.

patterns in the database.
