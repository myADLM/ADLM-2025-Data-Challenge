510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
k080909
B. Purpose for Submission:
New device
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Ikonisys, Inc., Ikoniscope® oncoFISH™ her2 Test System
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
An automated system for enumeration of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
signals of HER-2/neu gene in human breast cancer specimens.
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Ikoniscope® oncoFISH her2 Test System is an automated scanning
microscope system incorporating automated slide loading and handling, low and
high magnification scanning to identify targets of interest and digital image
acquisition, coupled with an image analysis workstation. Microscope slides,
prepared according to the DNA probe manufacturers’ specifications, are placed
into a multiple slide cassette, and loaded into the Ikoniscope® oncoFISH her2
Test system. The system unloads each slide, scans each one, and returns it to the
cassette automatically. During scanning, images of cells exhibiting the
predetermined characteristics for FISH signals are digitally photographed and
stored. After all the slides are scanned, the workstation provides an image gallery
for each slide that displays the image of each cell meeting predetermined
characteristics and quantity and places scanned nuclei into scorable categories,
established according to the specifications in the DNA probes FDA cleared
labeling. The operator/reader can then evaluate the cell nuclei, and make the
diagnostic determination accordingly.
2. Principles of Operation:
The Ikoniscope® oncoFISH her2 Test System combines elements of existing
technologies to perform its function. Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH)
uses commercially available, FDA cleared, DNA probes (not supplied with the
test system). Samples are prepared according to the instructions for the Vysis®
PathVysion™ HER-2 DNA Probe kit. The user selects the appropriate areas for
analysis in accordance with the PathVysion™ kit instructions. The oncoFISH
system scans and captures images for each of the selected areas and the automatic
algorithm detects and enumerates the fluorescent signals. The user reviews the
signal enumeration for all relevant cells and the results (total number of cells and
overall signal ratio) are automatically calculated by the system.
There is no change in the system hardware from the previously cleared system.
Software changes were implemented to support the new indication for use for
HER-2/neu FISH automated enumeration. The device methodology is well

J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
Four clinical laboratories provided previously manually enumerated
PathVysion slides for the method comparison study. The PathVysion slides
from the four collection sites were tested at two (2) clinical laboratories with
two (2) Ikoniscope® oncoFISH her2 systems. Each collection site provided
25 consecutive amplified (positive) and 25 non-amplified (negative)
PathVysion slides for oncoFISH her2 testing. The H&E slides with the
scribed area of interest for each corresponding PathVysion slide were used for
the oncoFISH her2 testing. A total of 182 slides were enumerated by the
PathVysion manual and oncoFISH her2 methods. The slides consisted of 100
non-amplified slides with a HER2/CEP17 ratio of 0.8 – 1.91 and 82 amplified
slides with a HER2/CEP17 ratio of 2.02 – 11.3 by manual PathVysion.
Reasons for the discordant results were poor slide quality, high background or
few cells (n=3); operator not properly selecting amplified images from scan
(n=3) or region or interest (ROI) identified on the H&E and PathVysion slides
differ (n=1).
Overall Agreement was 94.5% (172/182), Positive Percent Agreement 91.5%
(75/82) and Negative Percent Agreement 97% (97/100).

Sites 1 and 3 each had discordant results between manual PathVysion and
oncoFISH her2 for slide #6, while Site 2 reported this slide as non-amplified
for both manual PathVysion and oncoFISH. Slides 1 and 2 were
indeterminate (HER2/CEP17 = 1.8 – 2.2) based on their original PathVysion
results but in this reproducibility study, these two slides were found non-
amplified by both manual PathVysion (mean ratios 1.14 – 1.83) and
oncoFISH (mean ratios = 1.23 – 1.98) by all three sites. Two (2) manual
PathVysion slides were not readable due to no cells to score or failed
hybridization. Four (4) Ikoniscope oncoFISH slides could not be analyzed
with one had no cells to score, one with insufficient cells and two
