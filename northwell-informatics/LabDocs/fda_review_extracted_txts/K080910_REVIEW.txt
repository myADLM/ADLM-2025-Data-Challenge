510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
K080910
B. Purpose for Submission:
To obtain clearance for a new device.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
BioImagene, Inc. PATHIAM System with iScan for HER2/neu
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
iScan instrument and image analysis software for detection of expression of
HER2/neu
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The PATHIAM™ System is an instrument (iScan) and image analysis software
system designed to assist the qualified pathologist in the consistent quantitative
assessment of marker expression in immunohistochemically stained histological
sections digital images. The sample tissue is breast tissue prepared using the
DAKO HercepTest Reagent Kit. The PATHIAM system consists of the
BioImagene iScan slide scanner, computer with the PATHIAM Software,
monitor, keyboard and mouse.
Hardware: The iScan slide scanning device captures digital images of formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues that are suitable for storage, viewing and visual
analysis. The device includes a digital slide scanner, racks for loading glass slides,
an Intel based PC, dual core, dual Xeon processor, PATHIAM Software, and a
monitor.
Software: The PATHIAM Software requires competent human intervention at all
steps in the analysis process. The system is designed to complement the routine
workflow of a qualified pathologist screening the immunohistochemically stained
histological slides with additional quantitative data to assist the reproducibility of
the slide interpretation. It allows the user to select the area of interest on the breast
tissue image. The user marks the area of interest for the analysis. The system
software makes no independent interpretations of the data. The software will act
as a tool for the user, to improve consistency and data recording. The image

produced digitally may also be used independent of the software, by allowing the
pathologist to count from the digital image, rather than from the microscope.
2. Principles of Operation:
The PATHIAM System digitizes formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded normal and
neoplastic tissue and provides semi-quantitative analysis of extent and intensity of
stained tissue, providing the pathologist with an aid to interpretation of the level
of expression of HER2/neu in breast cancer tissue. The pathologist is presented
with a digital image of the tissue section and a suggested staining score (0 to 3).
The pathologist then makes an assessment of the digital image and reports his/her
score. Alternately, the pathologist can simply use the digitized image to perform
his interpretation of the level of expression, without employing the software.
3. Modes of Operation:
Semi-automated computer-assisted interpretation
4. Specimen Identification:
Instrument operator assigned using patient surgical pathology number (SPN).
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded normal and neoplastic tissue
6. Calibration:
Not applicable
7. Quality Control:
The PATHIAM software assesses the quality of the image to ensure it passes
minimum standards before it is analyzed.

G. Intended Use:
1. Indication(s) for Use:
PATHIAM-Assisted Scoring: Intended for clinical laboratory use as an accessory
to the DAKO HercepTest to aid in the detection and semi-quantitative
measurement of HER2/neu in formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded normal and
neoplastic tissue. When used with the DAKO HercepTest, PATHIAM-Assisted
scoring is indicated for use as aid in the assessment of breast cancer patients for
whom HERCEPTIN® (Trastuzumab) treatment is being considered. The
pathologist should verify agreement with the PATHIAM score.
HER2/neu results are indicated for use as an aid in the management, prognosis
and predication of therapy outcomes of breast cancer. Note: The actual
correlation of the DAKO HercepTest to HERCEPTIN® clinical outcome has not
been established.

Not applicable
J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
Comparison with Manual HercepTest Method:
Values for staining intensity were obtained from a review of PATHIAM
values by trained pathologists at three sites, who viewed both the digital
images and the score provided by the software, and then selected an
appropriate tissue score (0 to 3). Tissue samples for the study were all
procured for a single site. The same pathologist read the same slides manually
using the DAKO HercepTest package insert. The manual assessment took
place seven days before the experiments with the PATHIAM System were
completed at the sites.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
In the reproducibility study between pathologists and the PATHIAM System
the PATHIAM System was tested by analyzing images of the same set of 176
stained tissue specimens by three pathologists at three sites. Pathologists
recorded their estimation of the score from the score provided by the
PATHIAM System plus their review of the digital images provided by the
software. Concordance for the PATHIAM System values between labs
ranged from 89% to 92%.
