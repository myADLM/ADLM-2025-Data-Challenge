K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
• ISO 15197: In vitro diagnostic test systems - Requirements for blood-glucose
monitoring systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus.
L. Test Principle:
Glucose measurement is based on electrical potential caused by the reaction of glucose with
the reagents contained on the strip’s electrodes. The glucose in the sample is oxidized by the
enzyme glucose oxidase, and the current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured
and converted to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is
proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Day to Day Precision:
The sponsor evaluated intermediate precision of the device using 10 replicate
measurements (over 10 days) from 10 meters (100 tests) of the 3 concentrations of
control solutions with 1 strip lot. Results are summarized below.
CareSens II
Average glucose concentration 44.1 116.0 387.0

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To establish the linearity of the system through the range of 20 to 600 mg/dL 8
glucose adjusted whole blood samples (actual range tested was 24 to 595 mg/dL
according to YSI and 20 to 580 mg/dL when tested with the meters) were compared
to YSI 2300 using 10 replicate measurements from 5 meters (50 tests) with 1 strip lot.
Linear regression yields the following statistics:
Slope y-intercept r2
CareSens II 0.98 -2.07 0.9989
CareSens POP 0.96 -0.74 0.9988
The sponsor claims 20 mg/dL as the lowest detectable limit in the labeling.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The device is traceable to a laboratory analyzer which is calibrated to a glucose
standard (NIST SRM 917a).
The two control solutions consist of buffered aqueous solutions of D (+)-glucose
containing stabilizers, preservatives, and other non-reactive ingredients. Lot-specific
ranges are printed on the test strip bottle label.
Closed Vial Stability of Control Solution: The measured glucose levels of 3 lots of
CareSens control solutions during the shelf lifetime period (24 months) are all within
the specified ranges (88mg/dL - 132mg/dL for mid level, 160mg/dL - 240mg/dL for
high level solutions), and the average bias with respect to the mean value throughout
the lifetime is less than ±4%.
Opened Vial Stability of Control Solution: The measured glucose levels of 3 lots of
CareSens control solutions during the use lifetime period (90 days) are all within the

specified ranges (88mg/dL - 132mg/dL for mid level, 160mg/dL - 240mg/dL for high
level solutions), and the average bias with respect to the mean value throughout the
lifetime is less than ±6.5%.
The expected values the glucose control solutions were established by repeat testing
of 10 meters with 5 test strips each and measuring of the two levels of control
solution. The glucose levels of each control solution are then determined in the +-
20% range from the observed averages of the 50 measurements taken for each
solution. The expected results may change with each new lot, but the control range is
listed in the product insert.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the system is 20 - 600 mg/dL. This range was verified by the
linearity study (above section M.1.b.).
e. Analytical specificity:
Spiked whole blood samples containing normal levels of glucose (30 – 260 mg/dL)
with and without interfering substances were prepared to test common endogenous
and exogenous substances for interference. Levels tested for each interferant are
summarized below:
Interferent
(mg/dL) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Level 5
Dopamine 0 3.75 6.5 9.75 13
Acetaminophen 0 5 10 15 20
Uric acid 0 5 10 15 20
Ascorbic acid 0 5 10 15 20
Ascorbate 0 0.75 1.5 2.25 3
Galactose 0 12.5 25 37.5 50
Bilirubin 0 10 20 30 40
Methyldopa 0 0.625 1.25 1.875 2.5
Levodopa 0 1 2 3 4
Maltose 0 12.5 25 37.5 50
Creatinine 0 7.5 15 22.5 30
Salicylic acid 0 12.5 25 37.5 50
Interference testing showed that the CareSens II and CareSens POP systems result in
less than ±10% bias in the presence of high concentrations of interferants even
beyond clinically significant ranges. Positive errors greater than 10% where found in
the presence of galactose (≥50 mg/dL at glucose levels of 85 mg/dL and ≥12.5 mg/dL
at glucose levels of 30 mg/dL), maltose (≥50 mg/dL at glucose levels of 30 mg/dL),
and ascorbic acid (>10 mg/dL). Ascorbate showed that the interfering response may
be significant if its concentration is over 3 mg/dL.
An altitude study was performed with volunteers in an altitude simulation chamber
with capillary whole blood from volunteers whose blood glucose ranged from ~80 to
5

140 mg/dL and spiked whole blood samples of 60 and 310 mg/dL. The simulator was
set to 10,000 feet. The test data using capillary blood samples using both meters
showed that the bias versus YSI at 10,000 feet is the same bias versus YSI as that
observed at sea level. These data indicate no additional effect due to altitude up to
10,000 feet.
To test the accuracy of the hematocrit effect, blood adjusted to hematocrit levels of
20%, 40%, and 60% at glucose concentrations of 63, 144, 264, 440 mg/dL for the
CareSens II meter and 60, 143, 244, 414 mg/dL for the POP meter were tested a total
of 10 times at each concentration and averaged and compared to the 40% hematocrit
result (40% being considered a normal hematocrit value for patients). The sponsor
demonstrated that no bias greater than 15% when samples were compared to 40%
hematocrit occurred within the claimed range of 20% to 60%.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To demonstrate the accuracy performance of the CareSens II and POP Blood Glucose
Monitoring Systems, trained specialists tested the capillary blood samples from the
finger of 110 patients (with samples ranging from 30 to 485 mg/dL) and compared
the results to the results from a laboratory reference method (YSI) using samples
taken at the same time. *Samples with blood glucose levels below 50 mg/dL were
obtained by glycolysis of patient samples. The pO2 levels of the glycolyzed blood
samples were adjusted to that of capillary blood samples before the measurements.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor included the following expected values for normal glucose levels in their
strip labeling:
70-110 mg/dL (3.9-6.1 mmol/L)
One-hour after a meal: less than 160 mg/dL (8.9 mmol/L)
Diagnosis of Diabetes, NIH Publication No. 05-4642, January 2005
N. Instrument Name:
CareSens II Blood Glucose Monitoring System
CareSens POP Blood Glucose Monitoring System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ______
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm,
forearm, thigh, and calf. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip
there are no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
A code number is provided with each batch of test strips to calibrate the meter for that
batch. The code number is associated with the meter by inserting a test strip and entering
the code number to match that found on the test strip bottle. No further calibrations are
required of the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor has two levels of controls available for this meter with both levels coming
with the kit and also being available through the distributor. When a test strip is inserted
into the meter, a control can be run. An acceptable range for each control level is printed
on the test strip vial label. The user is referred to a troubleshooting section at the end of
the control test instructions of the owner’s manual to identify possible reasons control
results fall outside these ranges.
