L. Test Principle:
The Precision Xceed Pro Blood Glucose and B-Ketone Monitoring System measures glucose
electrochemically. The glucose biosensor is capable of determining glucose oxidized by the
enzyme (Glucose Dehydrogenase, GDH-NAD) catalyzed reaction with Nicotinamide
Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+) cofactor. The reduced form of NAD + (NADH) is re-oxidized
by reaction with the electrochemical mediator, 1,10-phenanthroline quinone (1,10-PQ). The
reduced mediator is re-oxidized via electron transfer at the electrode surface. This current is
translated into a number by the monitor, after applying lot specific calibration information
and after a 20 second countdown, a concentration value is presented to the user. In this same
manner, the biosensor electrode utilizes the enzyme hydroxybutyrate Dehydrogenase
(HBDH), which reacts with the beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-ketone) concentration in the
sample. This reaction is transferred to the monitor through an electrical current generated
proportional to the level of beta-ketone in the sample. This current is translated into a number
by the monitor, after applying lot specific calibration information and after a 10 second
countdown, a concentration value is presented to the user.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Glucose precision was established in k021960.
B-ketone within-run precision - Testing with blood was conducted using four Xceed
meters for each of three lots of blood ketone test strips with three venous whole blood
samples. Each blood was spiked to five 3-OHB (ketone) levels (0-0.75, 0.75-1.5, 1.5-
3, 3-4.5 and 4.5-8.0 mmol/L). For each lot of test strips, twenty replicate
measurements were performed for each blood and ketone level. Testing with control
solution was conducted over two runs using four Xceed meters for each of three lots
of blood ketone test strips with low, mid and high ketone control solution. For each
run and lot of test strips forty replicate measurements were performed for each
control solution level.

--- Page 5 ---
Results from testing with blood; the mean response, standard deviation (SD) and
coefficient of variation (% CV) were calculated for each lot of test strips, blood,
meter and ketone level. Mean results were then calculated for each ketone level by
lot and over the three lots of test strips. Mean values for SD and % CV were
calculated using root mean square (RMS). Results from testing with control solution;
the mean response, SD and % CV were calculated for each lot of test strips, run,
meter and control solution level. Mean results were then calculated for each control
solution level by lot and over the three lots of test strips. Mean values for SD and %
CV were calculated using root mean square.
Summary of results:
Range of within-run SD and % CV over 3 lots of test strips
Whole blood ketone level (mmol/L)

SD (mmol/L) % CV % CV
0.03-0.05 2.4-2.8 2.3-2.5
B-ketone between-run precision - Testing was conducted over twenty days using ten
Xceed meters and three lots of blood ketone test strips with low, mid and high ketone
control solution. For each meter, two replicates were performed on each day, lot of
test strips and control solution level.
The mean response, standard deviation (SD) and coefficients of variation (% CV)
were calculated for each lot of test strips and control solution level. Mean results were
then calculated over the three lots of test strips. Mean values for SD and % CV were
calculated using root mean square.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Glucose linearity was established in k021960.
B-ketone linearity – The study was conducted over 2 days. On each day, capillary
whole blood samples were collected from 20 donors. The capillary samples were
spiked to varying ketone concentrations and distributed throughout the measuring
range, from 0.01-8.0mmol/L. Three lots of test strips were tested. Duplicate
measurements were performed for each lot of test strips, day and blood sample.
The sponsor’s acceptance criteria of +/- 0.3mmol/L for ketone levels below
1.5mmol/L and +/- 10 % for ketone levels at or above 1.5mmol/L were met. The
linear regressions for lot 1 was y = 0.96x – 0.01, r2 = 0.99, for lot 2 was y = 0.99x –
0.03, r2 = 0.99, and for lot 3 was y = 0.95x + 0.01, r2 = 1.00. This testing also
demonstrated that readings of “Hi” were consistently obtained for ketone levels
> 8.0mmol/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Glucose controls traceability and stability was established in k021960.
Ketone controls traceability and stability was established in k040814.
d. Detection limit:
Glucose detection limit was established in k021960.
B-ketone limit of detection is 0.01mmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Glucose analytical specificity was established in k021960.
Since the B-ketone test strips have not been modified since clearance in k040814, the
B-ketone specificity established in k040814 is applicable.

were obtained by healthcare professionals and tested. The samples tested had glucose
values ranging from 71 to 547 mg/dL, and ketone values ranging from 0.03 to 0.48
mmol/L. Test results comparing lay user to healthcare professionals are summarized
below as linear regressions.
