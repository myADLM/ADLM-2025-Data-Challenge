H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Lin-Zhi International (LZI) Buprenorphine Enzyme Immunoassay when used
in conjunction with Beckman Coulter Synchron LX, CX and UniCel DxC
automated clinical chemistry analyzers, is intended for the qualitative and semi-
quantitative determination of norbuprenorphine (buprenorphine metabolite) in
human urine, at a cutoff value of 10 ng/mL.
The Norbuprenorphine Drugs of Abuse (DAU) Calibrators are for use as
calibrators in qualitative and semi-quantitative calibration of the Lin-Zhi
International (LZI) Buprenorphine Enzyme Immunoassay with Beckman Coulter
Synchron LX, CX and UniCel DxC automated clinical chemistry analyzers.
The Norbuprenorphine Drugs of Abuse (DAU) Controls are for use as assayed
quality control materials to monitor the precision of the Lin-Zhi International
(LZI) Buprenorphine Enzyme Immunoassay with Beckman Coulter Synchron
LX, CX and UniCel DxC automated clinical chemistry analyzers.
The assay provides a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative
chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory
method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to
any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The assay is for prescription use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Beckman Coulter Synchron CX, LX and UniCel DxC automated clinical
chemistry analyzers.
I. Device Description:
The assay consists of ready-to-use liquid reagents. Reagent 1 contains mouse
monoclonal anti-buprenorphine antibody, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and stabilizers. Reagent 2 contains buprenorphine-
labeled glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in buffer. The calibrators
controls are ready to use human urine-based liquid and are sold separately.

sample and drug labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PDH) for a fixed amount of antibody in the reagent. In the absence of drug in the
sample, the antibody binds the conjugated buprenorphine-labeled G6PDH thus the
enzyme activity id inhibited. When free drug is present on the sample, the antibody
will bind to the free drug and the unbound buprenorphine-labeled G6PDH exhibits its
maximal enzyme activity. The G6PDH activity is measured spectrophotometrically at
340 nm because of conversion of NAD to NADH.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra-assay and between run precision was determined by spiking a standard
norbuprenorphine solution into drug free urine at various concentrations
(-75%, -50%, -25%, at the cutoff, +25% and 50%, 75% and 100% of the
cutoff). Concentrations were confirmed by LC/MS. Testing for intra-assay
imprecision was performed with 21 replicates in one day on the CX4CE,
LX20 Pro and DxC 600 analyzers. The between run testing was performed
twice a day for 10 days on all three analyzers. The qualitative and semi-
quantitative results are presented below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the range was confirmed by serially diluting a spiked urine
pool containing 100 ng/mL of Norbuprenorphine in 10% increments. Each
sample was assayed in replicates of 10 on each analyzer in the semi-
quantitative mode. The results were averaged and compared to the expected
result and the percent recovery was calculated. Sponsor calculated the %

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
Calibrators and Controls:
A commercially available norbuprenorphine standard solution from Cerolliant
Analytical Reference Standards is used and traceable to NIST standard. This
standard solution is made into a secondary (lower concentration) stock
solution. The secondary stock solution is then spiked into the calibrators and
controls to the desired concentration. The concentrations are confirmed by
GC/MS.
Stability Studies:
Real time and accelerated studies have been conducted. Protocols and
acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The
manufacturer claims the following expiration date:
When stored at 2-8 ºC unopened product is good until expiration date which is
18 months.
On board stability is good for 14 days when stored at 2-8 ºC.

There is the possibility that other substances and/or factors not listed above
may interfere with the test and cause false results, e.g., technical or procedural
errors
Cross-reactivity was evaluated by spiking various concentrations of similarly
structured drug compounds into drug-free urine. By analyzing various
concentrations of each compound the sponsor determined the concentration of
the drug that produced a response approximately equivalent to the 10 ng/mL
cutoff concentration of the assay. The percentage cross reactivities of those
compounds are presented below:
