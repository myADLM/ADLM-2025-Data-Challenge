For use with MicroScan® Dried Gram Positive MIC/Combo, Dried Gram
Positive Breakpoint Combo and Dried Gram Positive ID Type 2 panels.
MicroScan® Positive panels are designed for use in determining antimicrobial
agent susceptibility and/or identification to the species level of rapidly growing
aerobic and facultative gram-positive cocci, some fastidious aerobic gram positive
cocci and Listeria monocytogenes. Refer to Limitation of Procedure Section for
use with fastidious streptococci.
The MicroScan® Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel is used to determine
qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on solid media of
rapidly growing aerobic and facultative gram-positive cocci.
2. Indication(s) for use:
This submission is indicated for the addition of Cefoxitin Screen at a cefoxitin
concentration of 4 μg/mL to the gram positive susceptibility panel for testing
Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus lugdunensis only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
The Prompt® method of inoculation is an alternate method of inoculation
preparation that is supported in the methodology along with the turbidity method.
The stationary and log inoculum methods should not be used with this antibiotic.
4. Special instrument requirements:
These panels can be read at > 16 hours of incubation either manually,
automatically on the autoScan® 4, or with the WalkAway® instrument systems.
I. Device Description:
The MicroScan® Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel contains microdilutions of
each antimicrobial agent in various concentrations with Mueller Hinton Broth and
various nutrients which are dehydrated and dried in panels. Each panel contains two
control wells: a no-growth control well (contains water only/no nutrients or broth),
and a growth control well (contains test medium without antibiotic). The panel is
rehydrated and inoculated at the same time with 0.1 ml of suspension prepared by the
turbidity method (inoculum prepared in water, then 0.1ml transferred to 25ml of
inoculum water containing pluronic-D/F-a wetting solution) for a final inoculum
concentration of 3-7 X 105. The Prompt® method of inoculation is also
recommended as an alternate means of preparing the inoculum. The panels are
incubated at 35o C in a non-CO for 16-20 hours and read by visual observation of
2
growth. Panels may also be read automatically with the WalkAway® or the
AutoScan®4.

Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
The Cefoxitin Screen uses the 18 hour result from a well containing cefoxitin at 4
μg/mL and growth media, labeled CfxS, and the oxacillin MIC at 18 hours. Isolates
that are CfxS positive (MIC>4) are considered to be resistant to oxacillin. If the
result is negative (MIC≤4), the oxacillin MIC is used to make a final assessment of
the susceptibility to penicillinase stable beta-lactams.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates tested at 3 sites on 3
separate days in triplicate. Acceptable reproducibility was demonstrated with
only category agreement (Negative, Positive) since that is all that is detected.
The study included the testing of the following inoculum and reading
variables; turbidity inoculum method and Prompt® method of inoculation
with reading performed manually using a touchScan® SR, autoScan 4® or the
WalkAway® instrument.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality Control was performed daily with the turbidity method, and Prompt®
method with the following results and expected ranges as stated. The values
repeat the number of times a result was obtained at each concentration.

Quality control results demonstrated the ability of all variables of the procedure
(reading and inoculation) to produce acceptable results most of the time.
Although the modes are the same, the Prompt® inoculation method appears to
have more results at MIC of >4 with the S. aureus ATCC 29213. The Prompt®
inoculation method with S. aureus ATCC 43300 also had more results at the >16
when compared to the Turbidity method.
Inoculum density control: A turbidity meter was used for the turbidity inoculation
method. The Prompt® method of inoculation had colony counts (CC) performed
periodically throughout the study to determine the average inoculum density since
there is no visual check of the inoculum using this device. The Prompt® method
of inoculation had an average of 1.05 x 106 CFU/mL for S. aureus ATCC 43300
with a range of 1.9 x 105 to 2.38 x 106 CFU/mL and an average of 1.82 x 106
CFU/mL for S. aureus ATCC 29213 with a range of 2.7 x 105 to 7.9 x 106
CFU/mL. The CFU study demonstrated that the S. aureus has a higher
concentration of organism that reproduces a more resistant result which would
explain the more resistant results with the QC study. The inoculum of the
Prompt® method generally provides a higher number of CFU with more
variability than a method using a turbidity meter.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical testing was performed at three sites using fresh isolates supplemented
with stock isolates of gram positive cocci. A comparison of the MicroScan®
Dried Gram-Positive test panel results was made to the reference method as
recommended in the CLSI standard M7-A7 with the following deviations
from that recommendation: Pluronic-F is used as the inoculum in the frozen
reference panels. This is composed of water which contains a very small
amount of Pluronic to provide a smoother draw of liquid into the inoculator.
Testing of the reference method and the MicroScan panels was performed at
the same time. A challenge set was also tested at one site and compared to the
reference broth dilution result mode that was determined by previous testing
of each isolate multiple times in the recommended reference panel. All
isolates tested grew in the MicroScan panels.

CA is when the interpretation of the reference method agrees exactly with the
interpretation of the MicroScan® results.
The challenge set of organisms was also tested using the Prompt® method and
turbidity method of inoculation with all reading methods. This included 75
challenge isolates that were tested at two sites. The inoculum was prepared by the
turbidity or Prompt® method and incubated in the WalkAway® instrument. All
panels had additional readings performed after the WalkAway® reading was
completed using the autoScan®-4 and then manually on the touchSCAN®-SR.
The table below demonstrates the numbers that were in exact agreement with the
reference method results.
