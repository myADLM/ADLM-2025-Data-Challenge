ProFlu™ Plus
Common Name: Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) Multiplex Nucleic Acid Detection Assay
G. Regulatory Information:
1. Regulation section:
21 CFR 866.3980, Respiratory viral panel multiplex nucleic acid assay
2. Classification:
Class II
3. Product code:
OCC
4. Panel:
Microbiology (83)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The ProFlu+™ Assay is a multiplex Real Time RT-PCR in vitro diagnostic test for the
rapid and qualitative detection and discrimination of Influenza A Virus, Influenza B
Virus, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) nucleic acids isolated and purified from
nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens obtained from symptomatic patients. This test is
intended for use to aid in the differential diagnosis of Influenza A, Influenza B and RSV
viral infections in humans and is not intended to detect Influenza C.
Negative results do not preclude influenza or RSV virus infection and should not be used
as the sole basis for treatment or other management decisions. It is recommended that
negative RSV results be confirmed by culture.
Performance characteristics for Influenza A Virus were established when Influenza A/H3
and A/H1 were the predominant Influenza A viruses in circulation. When other Influenza
A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.
If infections with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
1

epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture
should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and
culture specimens.

Reproducibility
See K073029 and comparing the ProFlu+ reproducibility, defined in this study as the
closeness of agreement of repeated testing where only the extraction conditions are
changed (easyMAG vs. MagNA Pure).

Analytical sensitivity (LoD) as defined as the lowest concentration at which ≥ 95% of all
replicates tested positive, ranged from 102 – 10-1 TCID /mL.

Influenza A, Influenza B, RSV A and RSV B on each automated extractor.

a One sample was positive for both IA (expected) and RSV(suspected contamination). The sample was still
positive in both the IA and RSV channel after repeat testing in duplicate and therefore, was an invalid
sample and was excluded from analysis.
b One replicate was negative for IB on the MP only. Repeat testing in duplicate of the extracted nucleic
acid gave positive results for IB (original data, not repeat was used for analysis).

still positive in both the IA and RSV channel after repeat testing in duplicate and therefore, was an
invalid sample and was excluded from analysis.

gave positive results for IB. The repeat testing results were not included in the analysis for MP.
