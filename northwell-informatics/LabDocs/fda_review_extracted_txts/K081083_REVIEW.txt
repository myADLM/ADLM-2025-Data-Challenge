H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The CEDIA Mycophenolic Acid Assay is an in vitro diagnostic immunoassay
intended for the quantitative determination of mycophenolic acid in human
plasma or serum using automated clinical chemistry analyzers, as an aid in the
management of mycophenolic acid therapy in renal and cardiac transplant
patients.
The CEDIA Mycophenolic Acid Calibrators are intended for use in the calibration
of the CEDIA MPA Assay.
The MAS Mycophenolic Acid Controls are intended for use as assayed quality
control material for validation of MPA Assays.
2. Indication(s) for use:
See intended use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The assay cross-reacts with AcMPAG, the acyl glucuronide metabolite of MPA
(see cross-reactivity section, below) and may have an overall positive bias relative
to reference methods or other assays that do not cross-react with metabolites. The
relative bias in any particular patient sample depends in part on the metabolite
concentration in that sample.
Laboratories should include identification of the assay used on patient reports to
aid in interpretation of results. Also see the Expected Values section, below.
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Performance characteristics represented in the 510(k) were determined on the
Hitachi 917.
I. Device Description:
The device consists of a set of reagents including anti-MPA polyclonal antibodies
in buffer with preservatives and stabilizer, B-galactosidase “acceptor fragment” in
buffer with preservatives, MPA conjugated B-galactosidase “donor fragment”,
chlorophenol red, and B-D-galactopyranoside with stabilizers and preservatives.
Calibrators
2

--- Page 3 ---
The CEDIA MPA Calibrator kit is comprised of liquid-ready to use, low and high
calibrators, prepared in protein-based matrix containing stabilizers and less than 0.1%
sodium azide as a preservative. The low calibrator contains no analyte; the high
calibrator contains approximately 10 µg/mL MPA.
Controls
The MAS MPA Controls are liquid for ready-to-use controls prepared in plasma-based
matrix consisting of human plasma, stabilizers and less than 0.1% sodium azide as a
preservative. The 3 target concentrations for controls are 1.0, 2.5, and 6.0 µg/mL.
Materials of human origin, used in formulation of the MAS MPA controls, are tested for
HIV1, HIV2, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C by FDA approved methods and confirmed as
negative. However, as no test method can rule out infectious material with absolute
certainty, the material must be handled as though infectious.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s): Roche Total Mycophenolic Acid Assay
2. Predicate K number(s): k063520
3. Comparison with predicate:
Both assays have the same intended use. The tests differ in terms of test
principle: The CEDIA Mycophenolic Acid Assay is an immunoassay which
utilizes antibodies to mycophenolic acid. The predicate device is based on
enzyme-(inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase) inhibition and enzyme
mimicking principles. The assay range for this device extends to 10 ug/mL. The
range for the predicate device extends to 15 ug/mL.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
EP5-A2, CLSI Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement
Methods; Approved Guideline – Second Edition, EP5-A2 (2004).
L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on the enzyme β-galactosidase, which has been genetically engineered
into two inactive fragments termed enzyme donor (ED) and enzyme acceptor (EA).
These fragments spontaneously re-associate to form fully active enzymes that, in assay
format, cleave a substrate, generating a color change that can be measured
spectrophotometrically. In the assay, analyte in the specimen competes with analyte
conjugated to ED of β-galactosidase for limited numbers of antibody binding sites. If
analyte is present in the sample, it binds to the antibody, leaving the ED conjugate free to
form active enzymes with the EA. If analyte is not present in the sample, the antibody
binds to analyte conjugated to ED, inhibiting the re-association of ED to EA, and no
active enzyme is formed. The amount of active enzyme formed and resultant absorbance
3

--- Page 4 ---
change are directly proportional to the amount of drug present in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated using pooled patient samples, spiked samples, and MAS MPA
Controls. The two spiked samples (#1 and #3, in the table below) were prepared by
adding MPA stock solution to negative plasma specimens. The pooled patient sample
(#2, below) was prepared by combining specimens from transplant patients receiving
mycophenolic acid therapy. The three controls were manufactured in a plasma-based
matrix and spiked with MPA stock solution. Results were evaluated according to the
CLSI EP5-A2 precision protocol. For each of the 21 runs, three cups of each sample
were tested in duplicate to generate 6 data points for each sample per run. Calibration
was performed for each run. Results are summarized in the following table.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Results of the limit of quantitation and the linearity evaluations support the reportable
range 0.3–10.0 ug/mL for this assay. This section describes linearity and spike/recovery
studies. (Recovery and precision at the lower limit of the assay range are summarized in
the Detection Limit section, below).
Linearity:
Linearity was evaluated by diluting “high pools” prepared from heart transplant patients
and kidney transplant patients treated with MPA. The high pool was prepared to contain
approximately 10 µg/mL MPA and was serially diluted with an MPA-negative sample to
8 concentration levels distributed evenly across the assay range. Samples were measured
with the CEDIA assay in replicates (n=5). Measured concentrations were evaluated
against expected concentrations. Expected concentrations were calculated from the
measured value of the high sample and the dilution factor. The serially diluted samples
recovered within 10% or 0.1 µg/mL. Results are tabulated below.

Regression equation: Y=1.01x-0.09
The manufacturer recommends that samples with MPA concentrations greater than 10
ug/mL (the upper limit of the assay) may be diluted 1:1 with 0 calibrator and retested. To
evaluate recovery with this procedure eight patient samples with concentrations above 10
(µg/mL) were tested by diluting 1:1 (sample to diluent) according to the manufacturers
recommendations in the package insert. Recovery results in this evaluation ranged from
103-111%, relative to expected concentrations (based on reference method results).
Spike Recovery:
To evaluate accuracy by recovery, a gravimetrically prepared MPA stock solution was
spiked into both negative samples and patient samples already containing some MPA.
Expected concentrations were calculated as the original MPA concentration (measured by
CEDIA) plus the spiked MPA concentration (measured gravimetrically, independent of
the CEDIA assay). Recoveries were within 10%, or 0.1 ug/mL. Results are summarized
in the following tables.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators:
Calibrators are provided at 0 and 10 ug/mL. They are manufactured in a protein-based
matrix of human plasma. The manufacturer’s primary standards are traceable to
commercially available MPA material prepared gravimetrically using MPA of greater
than 99.5% purity. (No USP material is available). To assign values, lot calibrators are
tested with the CEDIA MPA Assay across multiple instruments, using primary standards
as calibrators. The manufacturer estimates the uncertainty in value assignment of lot
calibrators relative to primary standards as 0.0 for the 0-level and 0.13ug/mL for the 10
ug/mL level.
Controls:
The 3-level set of controls (1.0, 2.5, and 6.0 ug/mL) are manufactured in plasma-based
matrix and spiked using a characterized MPA stock solution. Control ranges are assigned
using multiple lots, instruments and operators. The labeling clarifies that the ranges are
provided only as a guide and that laboratories should establish their own acceptable
ranges.
Stability:
Expiration dating was established by real time stability studies for both unopened and re-
consituted calibrators. For each time point (n=10) , test calibrator was measured in
replicates, using fresh, reconstituted reagent, and primary standards that had been stored at -
80 degrees C. During testing, unopened calibrators were stored at 2-8 degrees C. No
significant change in calibrator recovery was seen throughout the expiration dating period.
Opened vial testing was performed with fresh reconstituted calibrators stored at 2-8 degrees
for the testing duration. Calibrator recovery at the end of expiration period was > 99%.
Stability studies are ongoing.

d. Detection limit:
Precision and accuracy of the assay near the low limits were evaluated. The study was
carried out in 6 runs with 7 replicates per run over 28 days on 3 instruments for a total of
42 data points. Specimens from organ transplant patients receiving mycophenolic acid
therapy were used. Individual patient plasma samples were combined to create pools
with a gradient of MPA concentrations, values confirmed by LC-MS/MS. The samples
were then dispensed as aliquots, stored at –20°C, and a single aliquot was thawed for
each immunoassay run. Inter-assay imprecision observed at the lower limit of the assay
(0.3 μg/mL) is < 18%, and calculated bias is < 0.1 at this concentration. Results are
summarized in the following table.

e. Analytical specificity:
Metabolite cross-reactivity:
The cross-reactivity of the CEDIA MPA Assay with 7-O-Glucuronide MPA (MPAG)
and Acyl Glucuronide MPA (AcMPAG) was evaluated. MPA metabolites were added
into both MPA-negative plasma and plasma containing various concentrations of MPA
(see below). Concentrations of metabolite were determined from gravimetric
measurement. Purities were determined by HPLC and Mass Spectral analysis. The
spiked samples were tested by the CEDIA MPA Assay in duplicate and cross reactivity
was calculated using the formula: % Cross reactivity = (Measured [MPA] - Expected
[MPA]) / Spiked [Metabolite] x 100%
AcMPAG cross-reactivity observed from this evaluation ranged from 144 to 178 %. See
table below. No cross reactivity (< 0.1%) was found to MPAG at concentrations as high
as 50-1000 ug/mL.

Cross Reactivity with Other Immunosuppressants:
Sirolimus, tacrolimus, and cyclosporine were tested for cross reactivity with the CEDIA
MPA Assay. Samples were prepared by adding the other immunosuppressants at
concentrations ranging up to 300 ng/mL (sirolimus and tacrolimus) and 1000 ng/mL
(cyclosporine) into plasma containing MPA. Corresponding controls were prepared by
adding the same volume of solvent that was in the stock solution of the compound.
Samples were assayed in triplicate for MPA. No significant interference was observed.
(Differences in MPA recovery between test and control samples were ≤ 0.1 ug/mL)
Cross Reactivity with Common Drugs:
Drugs that may be commonly used with mycophenolic acid were tested for cross
reactivity with the CEDIA MPA Assay. Samples were prepared, by adding high
concentrations of the drugs to MPA-negative plasma, as well as plasma containing 2.2
ug/mL MPA, and then tested in duplicate by CEDIA. Corresponding controls were
prepared by adding the same volume of solvent that was in the stock solution of the
compound. Bias between control samples and test samples were generally < 0.1 ug/mL,
indicating no interference under these conditions. A small bias (0.25 ug/mL) was
observed with high concentrations (50 ug/mL) of amphotericin B. A full list of the drugs
tested is included in the package insert.
Interference by Endogenous Substances:
Potential interference effects by high levels of bilirubin (20 mg/dL), triglycerides (1600
mg/dL), uric Acid (233 mg/dL), and hemoglobin (1 g/dL) were evaluated. Compounds
were added directly to MPA-negative plasma at target concentrations, as well as to
samples containing MPA at concentratiosn of 1.0, 2.5, and 6.0 ug/mL MPA. Naturally
occurring samples high in rheumatoid factor were also tested. Controls were prepared by
adding the same volume of solvent that was used to make the stock solution of the
compound being tested. Sample recoveries in this evaluation were all within +/- 10% and
no trends were observed due to endogenous compounds.
Samples containing high concentrations of cholesterol (up to 400 mg/dL) and total
protein (up to 11 mg/dL) from transplant patients receiving mycophenolic acid therapy
were also evaluated. Recoveries relative to expected values were within +/-10%.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable; this is a quantitative assay.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Leftover and unidentifiable clinical K2-EDTA plasma samples from heart and kidney
transplant patients receiving either mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolate sodium
therapy were obtained from a clinical site. The samples were tested at external sites and
the manufacturer’s site with the CEDIA assay and with a reference method. (Information
about the reference methods was included in the 510(k)). Samples were pre-dose
9

samples from adult patients. Co-administered drugs included tacrolimus (n= 153), and
cyclosporine (n=34). A more positive bias was observed for the latter samples in this
study, and this is illustrated in the graph in the package insert. Results of the regression
analyses based on data obtained at the manufacturer’s site, as well as an external site, are

b. Matrix comparison:
A split sample matrix comparison study was conducted to compare K EDTA samples,
2
used in the method comparison study, to Na EDTA, Na Heparin, Li Heparin, and NH
2 4
Heparin. Twenty-one samples across the assay range were prepared by spiking MPA into
each of paired matrix samples. The results of samples prepared in the evaluating matrix
were compared to those in K EDTA plasma by determining the slope, intercept and
2
correlation coefficient, as well as recoveries relative to K EDTA samples.

The optimal therapeutic range for MPA in plasma has not been fully established.
In addition, optimal patient MPA concentration ranges may vary depending on the
specific assay and its metabolite cross-reactivities, (See cross-reactivity section,
for observed cross-reactivities with this assay). Therefore, optimal ranges should
be established for each commercial test and values obtained with different assay
methods cannot be used interchangeably, nor should correction factors be applied.
Laboratories should include identification of the assay used on patient reports in
order to aid in interpretation of results.
Optimal ranges depend upon transplant type and co-administered drugs, as well as
the patient’s clinical state, individual differences in sensitivity to
immunosuppressive and toxic effects of MPA, time post-transplant and a number
of other factors. Individual MPA values cannot be used as the sole indicator for
making changes in treatment regimen and each patient should be thoroughly
evaluated clinically before changes in treatment regimens are made. Each
institution should establish the optimal ranges based on the specific assay used
and other factors relevant to its patient population.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
substantial equivalence decision.
