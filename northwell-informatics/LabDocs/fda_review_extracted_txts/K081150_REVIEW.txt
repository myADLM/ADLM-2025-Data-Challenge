L. Test Principle:
Urine applied at one end of the membrane mobilizes the anti-hCG antibody complex and
moves toward the other end of the membrane passing through the immobilized anti-hCG
antibody test region and through the antibody recognizing control region. In the
presence of hCG, the test line appears on the membrane together with the control line which
confirms the antibody complex arrival to the other end of the membrane. For the cassette
device, the sample is pipette onto the sample well. For the strip device, the sample is dipped
into the sample. The appearance of two color bands, one at the “T” and one at the “C” region
means the test is “positive”. The appearance of a color band at the “C” region but not at the
“T” region means the test is “negative”. The appearance of the procedural control “C” band
indicates that sufficient sample has been added. If there are no colored bands in the “C” area
and “T” area or if there is no color band in “C” area even there is a band in the “T” area; this
means “invalid” test result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed using human urine samples collected from healthy
pregnant women and non-pregnant women. Ten different concentrations (0, 10, 20,
25, 40, 50, 10,000, 50,000, 100,000, and 200,000 IU/L) of hCG values were prepared
in urine and was tested 100 times by one professional user and one lay user and
results were similar. Results are summarized as follows:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity is not applicable since this is a qualitative test.
A hook effect study was performed at levels of 0- 200,000 IU/L (0, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50,
10,000, 50,000, 100,000, and 200,000 IU/L) for each type of tests in combination
with the precision study. See 1.a., above. No hook effect was observed up to
200,000 IU/L of hCG value.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Rapidan Optima Early Urine Pregnancy Test and Toyo Urine Pregnancy Test are
calibrated against reference material traceable to WHO 4th International Standard,
1999 (code: 75/589).
A shelf-life stability test of the devices were performed in real-time and the results
showed that the devices were stable for 24 months when stored at 4-30oC (39-86oF).
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit was evaluated by testing 342 urine samples from 19 donors spiked
with varying hCG concentration. The hCG concentrations at levels of 0, 5, 10, 15,
20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400, 12800, and 25600 IU/L
were prepared and tested. All samples were tested in duplicates by 2 operators.
Results at concentrations near the cutoff are summarized below

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity studies were performed to evaluate the interferences from other
glycoprotein hormones such as hFSH, hLH, and hTSH. Human FSH (1000 IU/L),
hLH (500 IU/L), and hTSH (1000 IU/L) were added to urine samples with varying
hCG concentrations (0, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 10,000, 50,000, 100,000, 200,000 IU/L)
and tested in replicates for both devices (Rapidan Optima Early Urine Pregnancy Test
and Toyo Urine Pregnancy Test).
The results of these studies showed that there is no interference at 1000 IU/L hFSH, 500
IU/L hLH, or 1000 IU/L hTSH.
To evaluate the potential for interference by certain exogenous compounds, urine
samples with varying hCG concentrations (0, 10, 20, 25, and up to 200,000 IU/L)
were spiked with potential interferents and tested. No interferences were observed at
the following concentrations tested for both devices (Rapidan Optima Early Urine
Pregnancy Test and Toyo Urine Pregnancy Test):
Albumin: 10 mg/L, Ascorbic: 2 g/L, Cellulose: 5 g/L, Glucose: 2000 mg/dL,
Haptoglobin: 10 mg/L, Salicylic acid: 1 g/L, Peroxides: 100 mg/L, Hemoglobin: 1
mg/dL, Myoglobin: 10 mg/L, Fruit acid: 4 g/L, Bovine serum: 100 mg/L, Protein:
2000 mg/dL, Cow milk: 100 mg/L, Alcohol: 5 ml/L, Caffeine: 20 mg/dL, Gentisic
acid: 20 mg/dL, Atropine: 20 mg/dL.
The sponsor also evaluated the devices and found that samples with pH 4-9 or with
densities between 1.003-1.040 were not adversely affected and produced the
expected results.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off for a positive test for Rapidan Optima Early Urine Pregnancy Test is 20
IU/L.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
One hundred urine samples (50 from healthy pregnant and 50 from healthy non-
pregnant women, aged 19-46) were collected and split between the candidate devices
and the predicate devices (Wondfo One Step hCG urine pregnancy test).
Approximately 40% of the samples from pregnant women were collected around the
time of missed period. Testing was done at the manufacturing site. Results are

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Three hundred English-speaking women with various education backgrounds
participated in the lay user studies using the package insert as a guide. These 300
women donated urine samples and tested only one test device. Separate aliquots of
each of the urine samples were masked and provided for testing to the lay user and
the professional. The lay users and the professional performed the testing in separate
rooms. The professional also tested the predicate device and the results were the
same between the candidate device and the predicate device. There were 150 positive
samples and 150 negative samples.
An additional study with seventy-five English-speaking women was performed using
the package insert as a guide (English version only). The women tested spiked urine
samples with hCG concentrations ranging from 0-200 mIU/L, including the cut-offs.
Separate aliquots of each of the urine samples were masked and provided for testing
to the lay user and the professional. The lay users and the professional performed the
testing in separate rooms. The professional also tested the predicate device and the
results were the same between the candidate device and the predicate device. There
were 39 positive samples and 36 negative samples.
For both studies, there were complete agreement between lay user and professional
results for all the 3 devices tested: The Rapidan Optima Early Urine Pregnancy Test
(cassette) and the Toyo Urine Pregnancy Test (cassette and test strip formats).
In addition, each patient was given a questionnaire to assess the readability of the
labeling. The results of the questionnaire reflected that the consumers found the test
easy to use and that they did not have trouble understanding the labeling and
interpreting the results.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor notes in the package insert that negative results [with this test] are expected
in healthy, non-pregnant women. This sponsor’s intended use is for this test to detect
pregnancy by the first day of the missed period.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
