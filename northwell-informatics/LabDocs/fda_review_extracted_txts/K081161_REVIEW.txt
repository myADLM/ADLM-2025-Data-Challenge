L. Test Principle:
Proteins contained in human body fluids react with specific antibodies in the reagent, to form
immune complexes in an immunochemical reaction. These complexes in the reaction mixture
cause the scatter of a beam of light passed through the samples. The intensity of the scattered
light is proportional to the concentration of IgG in the sample. The result is evaluated by
comparison with a standard of known concentration.

Reproducibility testing was done in accordance with CLSI document EP5-A2. The
intra-assay reproducibility was determined by testing two samples in duplicate twice
a day for 20 days. The samples included two human source urine pools (1.0 mg/dL
and 4.4 mg/dL), and one Protein 3 control (2.3 mg/dL). The urine pools had %CV of
1.62% and 2.22%; Protein 3 control 4.66%.
The inter-assay reproducibility was determined by testing the same three samples in
duplicate twice a day for 20 days. The urine pools had %CV of 7.64% and 3.55%;
Protein 3 control 6.71%. The data are summarized below:
Material Mean Intra-assay Inter-assay
SD %CV SD %CV
Urine pool low 1.0 mg/dL 0.0159 1.62 0.0751 7.64
Urine pool high 4.4 mg/dL 0.0996 2.22 0.1549 3.55
PROT 3 CON 2.3 mg/dL 0.1047 4.66 0.1508 6.71
For CSF:
Reproducibility testing was done in accordance with CLSI document EP5-A2. The
intra-assay reproducibility was determined by testing two samples in duplicate twice
a day for 20 days. The samples included two human source CSF pools (1.1 mg/dL
and 11.4 mg/dL). Both CSF pools had %CV of 2.73%.
The inter-assay reproducibility was determined by testing the same two samples in
duplicate twice a day for 20 days. The CSF pools had %CV of 3.99% and 3.72%. The
data are summarized below:
Material Mean Intra-assay Inter-assay
SD %CV SD %CV

CSF pool 2 11.4 mg/dL 0.3105 2.73 0.4224 3.72
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
For Urine:
Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by testing a human urine sample with
high concentration (51.7 mg/L) of IgG. This sample was serially diluted 11 times
with System Diluent down to the lower detectable measuring range (4.88 mg/L). Each
dilution was tested in replicates of five. Data were analyzed in accordance to CLSI
EP06-A and EP17-A. Percent recovery was calculated using the formula: (Mean of
test/expected concentration) x 100. All dilutions met the acceptance criteria of 85 to
115%. The linear regression analysis was performed. Data showed a regression
equation y = -0.542055+1.028992, r2=0.999591.
Reportable range for IgG-U device was set at 4.4-50 mg/L.
For CSF:
Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by testing a human CSF sample with

high concentration (134 mg/L) of IgG. This sample was serially diluted 13 times with
System Diluent down to the lower detectable measuring range (6.63 mg/L). Each
dilution was tested in replicates of four or five. Data were analyzed in accordance to
CLSI EP06-A and EP17-A. Percent recovery was calculated using the formula:
(Mean of test/expected concentration) x 100. All dilutions met the acceptance criteria
of 85 to 115%. The linear regression analysis was performed. Data showed a
regression equation y = -0.244353+0.9993525, r2=0.999112.
Reportable range for IgG-CSF device was set at 4.4-123 mg/L.
Antigen Excess Effect:
The possibility of antigen excess occurring when using the device was evaluated with
urine and CSF samples above the assay range. The samples were analyzed on the
Dimension Vista™ instrument, indicating no antigen excess effect up to 5200 mg/L
for CSF and 5770 mg/L for urine.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrator and controls are traceable to the reference material ERM® DA 470
(CRM 470).
