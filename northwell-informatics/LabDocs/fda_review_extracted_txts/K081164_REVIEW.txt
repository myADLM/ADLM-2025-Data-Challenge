I. Device Description:
Two murine derived monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are used in the Diagnostic
Hybrids, Inc. (DHI) device, D3 DFA Cytomegalovirus Immediate Early Antigen
Identification Kit (CMV-IEA ID Kit), and are directed against CMV immediate early
antigen (pp 72). The MAbs used in the Kit have been shown to be highly specific,
with no cross-reactivity to other cultured viruses. The MAbs have been labeled by
DHI using Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC).
Kit Components
1. CMV-IEA DFA Reagent, 10-mL. One dropper bottle containing a mixture of two
murine MAbs directed against CMV immediate early antigen (pp 72). The MAbs
are both IgG1 (k) isotype. The buffered, stabilized, aqueous solution contains
Evans Blue as a counter-stain and 0.1% sodium azide as preservative.
2. CMV Antigen Control Slides, 5-slides. Individually packaged control slides
containing wells with cell culture derived positive and negative control cells. Each
slide contains one Negative well of uninfected cells and one Positive well of CMV
infected cells. Each slide is intended to be stained only one time.
3. Mounting Fluid, 7-mL. One dropper bottle of an aqueous, buffered, stabilized
solution of glycerol (ph 8.2 ± 0.2) and 0.1% sodium azide.
4. 40X PBS Concentrate, 25-mL. One bottle containing a 40X concentrate consisting
of 4% sodium azide (0.1% sodium azide after dilution to 1X using de-mineralized
water) in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution.

any CMV-IEA antigens present. After incubating for 15 to 30 minutes at 35º to 37ºC, the
stained cells are washed with the supplied Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and, using
the supplied Mounting Fluid, processed further for examination using a fluorescence
microscope equipped with the correct filter combination for Fluorescein Isothiocyanate
(FITC) at a magnification of 200-400X. Virus infected cells will contain bright apple-
green fluorescent nuclei while uninfected cells will contain no apple-green fluorescence
but will fluoresce red from the Evan’s Blue.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Not applicable
d. Analytical Sensitivity:
Analytical sensitivity was studied for purposes of demonstrating the
effectiveness of the D3 CMV-IEA DFA Reagent with that of a comparator
device. This was done by first inoculating two 96-well cell culture plates
(Hs27) with CMV diluted to a value of 1-TCID and incubating at 37°C for 48
50
hours; then, one plate was stained with the subject D3 CMV-IEA DFA Reagent
and the other plate was stained using the CMV-IEA DFA Reagent from the
comparator device. This assay was performed three times, with an average of
35.3 ±2.3 positive wells out of a total 96 wells detected with the subject, and an
average of 38.3 ±2.1 positive wells out of a total 96 wells with the predicate.
These results were not statistically different by a paired t-test.
Detection limit for the subject device CMV-IEA ID Kit was addressed under the
conditions: CMV, at a starting concentration 350-TCID per mL, was serially
50
diluted to a final value of 0.7-TCID per mL using 2-fold dilutions. Each
50
dilution was inoculated into confluent monolayers of Hs27 cells contained in
multi-well plates, centrifuged at 700 x g for 60 minutes and incubated at 35° to
37°C for 48 hours. The subject CMV-IEA ID Kit or the comparator device was
used to stain 3 monolayers of each viral dilution according to the respective
device’s product insert. The number of positive cells per well was counted.
The experiment was performed three times. The results suggest that the
detection limit of both fluorescent antibody stains are comparable, with 0.7-
TCID as the minimum viral dilution detected, as indicated by at least one well
50
having no detectable infection. These results were not statistically different by a
paired T-test.

Analytical Specificity (Cross-reactivity Testing):
The D3 DFA Cytomegalovirus Immediate Early Antigen Identification Kit DFA
Reagent was tested for cross-reactivity against a wide variety of cells and
microorganisms. Stringent conditions for cross-reactivity testing were achieved
by using a high concentration of the CMV-IEA DFA Reagent and relatively
high titers of microorganisms. The DFA Reagent was prepared at 2X the
concentration that is provided in the kit. No cross-reactivity was observed for
58 virus strains or for 20 host culture cell types. Twenty-five (25) bacterial
cultures, one yeast culture and three bacterial (Chlamydia sp.) and one
protozoan commercially available slides, were stained and examined for cross-
reactivity, including Staphylococcus aureus, a protein-A-producing bacterium.
Staining of S. aureus appeared as small points of fluorescence (see Limitations
of Procedure). Fifty-eight (58) virus strains were tested for cross-reactivity.
Depending on the particular virus, 140 to 1,400 TCID were inoculated into
50
shell vial culture and incubated for 24 to 48 hours, to yield a 1+ to 3+ infection,
processed and stained with the 2X DFA Reagent according to the procedure as
detailed in this product insert. No cross-reactivity was observed for the viruses

Thirty (30) microorganisms, including 25 bacterial cultures, one yeast and three bacterial
(Chlamydia sp.) and one protozoan commercially available slides, were stained with the
2X DFA Reagent according to the procedure as detailed in this product insert, then
examined for cross-reactivity. Except for Staphylococcus aureus, this was cross-reactive
with the CMV-IEA DFA Reagent (see above), all other microorganisms tested negative.
Concentrations for each bacterial organism cultured by DHI for cross-reactivity testing
were determined from suspensions of the bacteria in PBS by spectrophotometer
according to McFarland standards of levels1.0 and 2.0 (equaling approximately 3.0 x 106
and 6.0 x 106 CFU per mL). Slides were prepared with spots of 0.01-mL of the
suspensions to give either 3.0 x 104 or 6.0 x 104 per spot. At the same time, 1-mL of each
suspension was plated on an appropriate agar dish for colony confirmation. According to
the confirmation agar cultures, initial concentrations of the bacterial organisms in the
study ranged from 6.4 x 104 to 2.9 x 107 CFU. Results of testing are listed below.
