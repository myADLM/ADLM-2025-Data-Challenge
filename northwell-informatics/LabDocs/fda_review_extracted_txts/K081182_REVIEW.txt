H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The MicroScan Inducible Clindamycin test (ICd) is intended for use with the
MicroScan® Dried Gram Positive MIC/Combo Dried Gram Positive Breakpoint
Combo and Dried Gram Positive ID Type 2 panels. MicroScan® Positive panels
are designed for use in determining antimicrobial agent susceptibility and/or
identification to the species level of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative
anaerobic gram-positive cocci, some fastidious aerobic gram positive cocci and
Listeria monocytogenes. Refer to Limitation of Procedure Section for use with
fastidious streptococci.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The MicroScan Dried Gram Positive MIC/Combo Panel is used to determine
quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies
grown on solid media of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-
positive cocci. After inoculation, panels are incubated for 16 – 24 hours at 350
Celsius plus or minus 10 Celsius in a non- CO incubator and reads either visually
2
or with MicroScan® instrumentation, according to the package insert.
The MicroScan Inducible Clindamycin test (ICd) is intended to detect inducible
clindamycin resistance in staphylococci in a broth microdilution system. The ICd
test applies to isolates that are erythromycin resistant or intermediate and
clindamycin susceptible or intermediate.
This submission is for the addition of the Inducible Clindamycin test, consisting
of 4 mcg/ml of erythromycin and 0.5 mcg/ml of clindamycin, to the test panel.
The Gram positive organisms which may be used for the Inducible Clindamycin
test in this panel are: Staphylococcus species.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
The Prompt method of inoculation is an alternate method of inoculation
preparation that is supported in the methodology along with the turbidity. The log
and stationary inoculum methods should not be used with the Inducible
Clindamycin test.

4. Special instrument requirements:
These panels can be read at > 16 hours of incubation either manually,
automatically on the autoScan® 4, or with the WalkAway® instrument systems.
I. Device Description:
The MicroScan® Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel contains microdilutions of
each antimicrobial agent in various concentrations with Mueller Hinton Broth and
various nutrients which are dehydrated and dried in panels. Each panel contains two
control wells: a no-growth control well (contains water only/no nutrients or broth),
and a growth control well (contains test medium without antibiotic). The panel is
rehydrated and inoculated at the same time with 0.1 ml of suspension prepared by the
turbidity method (inoculum prepared in water, then 0.1ml transferred to 25ml of
inoculum water containing pluronic-D/F-a wetting solution) for a final inoculum
concentration of 3-7 X 105. The Prompt® method of inoculation is also
recommended as an alternate means of preparing the inoculum. The panels are
incubated at 35o C in a non-CO for 16-20 hours and read by visual observation of
2
growth. Panels may also be read automatically with the WalkAway® or the
AutoScan®4.

concentration (MIC) for the test organisms are read by determining the lowest
antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth. The panels are read either
manually using the MicroScan® Microdilution Viewer or with the autoSCAN® 4 or
the WalkAway® instruments, which uses an optics systems with growth algorithms to
directly measure organism growth.

Reproducibility was verified using 10 isolates at three clinical trial sites. Each
strain was tested at each site in replicates of three over three days (total of 27
replicates per strain). The two inoculum methods tested were the turbidity and
prompt with readings performed using the MicroScan® Microdilution Viewer
or with the autoSCAN® 4 or the WalkAway® instruments. Acceptable
reproducibility was demonstrated with >99% Agreement for all sites
combined.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality control was performed daily using three staphylococci strains, S.
aureus ATCC 29213, S. aureus ATCC BAA-976 and S. aureus ATCC BAA-
977 as recommended by CLSI. Testing was performed using both the
turbidity and prompt inoculation methods and all read methods (manually or

method. The Prompt® method of inoculation had colony counts (CC) performed
periodically throughout the study to determine the average inoculum density since
there is no visual check of the inoculum using this device. The Prompt®
inoculation method had an average colony count of 4.69 x 105 CFU/mL for E.
faecalis ATCC 29212 with a range of 6.0 x 104 to 8.9 x 105 CFU/mL, S. aureus
BAA 976 had an average colony count of 1.83 x 106 CFU/mL with a range of 2.9
x 105 – 4.5 x 106CFU/mL, S. aureus BAA 977 had an average colony count of
1.53 x 106 CFU/mL with a range of 4.1 x 105 – 5.6 x 106CFU/mL, S. aureus
ATCC 29213 had an average colony count of 1.82 x 106 CFU/mL with a range of
2.7 x 105 – 7.9 x 106CFU/mL . The CFU study demonstrated that the S. aureus
has a higher concentration of organism that reproduces a more resistant result.
The inoculum of the Prompt® method of inoculation generally provides a higher
number of CFU with more variability than a method using a turbidity meter.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical testing was performed at three sites using fresh isolates supplemented
with stock isolates of gram positive cocci. A comparison of the MicroScan®
Dried Gram-Positive test panel results was made to the reference method as
recommended in the CLSI standard M7-A6 with the following deviations
from that recommendation: Pluronic-F is used as the inoculum in the frozen
reference panels. Pluronic is a wetting agent which provides a smoother draw
of liquid into the inoculator. Testing of the reference method and the
MicroScan panels was performed at the same time. A challenge set was also
tested at one site and compared to the reference broth dilution result mode that
was determined by previous testing of each isolate multiple times in the
recommended reference panel. All isolates tested grew in the MicroScan
panels.

CA-Category Agreement vmj – very major errors
maj – major errors
CA is when the interpretation (S –I-R) of the reference method agrees exactly
with the interpretation of the MicroScan® result.
Essential Agreement and minor errors are not applicable since the Inducible
Clindamycin test is a one dilution test.
The challenge set of organisms was also tested using the Prompt® method and
turbidity method of inoculation with all reading methods. This included seventy
five challenge isolates that were tested at one site. Organism selection was based
on isolates that were erythromycin resistant or intermediate and clindamycin
susceptible or intermediate, and included 38 D-zone positive and 37 D-zone
negative strains. The inoculum was prepared by the turbidity or Prompt® method
and incubated in the WalkAway® instrument. All panels had additional readings
performed after the WalkAway® reading was completed using the autoScan®-4
and then manually on the touchSCAN®-SR. The table below demonstrates the
numbers that were in exact agreement with the reference method result and those
that differed by one or more wells.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The MicroScan Inducible Clindamycin test uses the result from a single well
containing 4 mcg/ml of erythromycin and 0.5 mcg/ml if clindamycin. Isolates that
are ICd positive (MIC>4/0.5) are considered to be clindamycin resistant. If ICd is
negative (MIC ≤4/0.5), the result indicates no inducible clindamycin resistance
and isolates are reported as tested (i.e. clindamycin susceptible or intermediate).
The gram-positive organisms which may be reported for the Inducible
Clindamycin test in this panel are: Staphylococcus spp.
Test Negative Positive
Inducible Clindamycin Test-Staphylococci ≤4/0.5 mcg/ml >4/0.5 mcg/ml
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The information submitted in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
