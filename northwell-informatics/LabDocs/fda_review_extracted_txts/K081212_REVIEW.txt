H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
MRSASelect is a selective and differential chromogenic medium for the
qualitative detection of nasal colonization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) to aid in the prevention and control of MRSA infections in
healthcare settings. The test can be performed on anterior nares specimens from
patients and healthcare workers to screen for MRSA colonization. MRSASelect
is not intended to diagnose MRSA infection nor to guide or monitor treatment of
infection. Result can be interpreted after 18 - 28 hours incubation.

MRSASelect is a selective and differential chromogenic medium for the
qualitative detection of nasal colonization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) to aid in the prevention and control of MRSA infections in
healthcare settings. The test can be performed on anterior nares specimens from
patients and healthcare workers to screen for MRSA colonization. MRSASelect
is not intended to diagnose MRSA infection nor to guide or monitor treatment of
infection. Result can be interpreted after 18 - 28 hours incubation.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not/applicable
I. Device Description:
MRSASelect is a selective medium for detection and direct identification of MRSA.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of nosocomial and life
threatening infections which have been associated with significantly higher rates of
mortality and morbidity.
The Bio-Rad MRSASelect is a selective and differential chromogenic culture
medium for the qualitative detection of MRSA from anterior nares specimens.
Results can be interpreted after 18 - 28 hours incubation.

(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA
CLSI M100-S15: Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Testing; Fifteenth Informational Supplement
L. Test Principle:
The selectivity of this medium is based on the presence of an antibiotic/antifungal
mixture and an optimized salt concentration that inhibits the growth of yeast and
the majority of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria with the exception of
methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Identification is based on the cleavage of a
chromogenic substrate by a specific enzymatic activity of Staphylococcus aureus
which produces a strong pink color of the Staphylococcus aureus colonies.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Comparison of the performances was conducted on 3 different batches of
MRSASelect to demonstrate no change in reproducibility with the lengthened
incubation time.
Reproducibility studies were performed using three lots of MRSASelect.
Thirty-five (35) different strains of micro-organisms were tested. The study
clearly demonstrated the reproducibility of the performance of MRSASelect.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
n/a
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality Control Strains recommended to be tested:
S. aureus ATCC 25923: Test organisms at a concentration of 104 – 105
CFU/plate.
S. aureus ATCC 43300: Test organisms at a concentration of 103 – 104
CFU/plate.
Test Strain Expected Results after 18 – 24 hours at 35 -37C
S. aureus ATCC 25923 No Growth
S. aureus ATCC 43300 Growth – small pink colonies
During the extended incubation study, sites tested quality control organisms
on each day of testing. Plates were read after 18, 20, 24, 28 hours incubation.
No differences were noted in QC results with the extended incubation.
d. Detection limit:
To confirm the level of detection for MRSASelect, 40 strains of MRSA were
plated on the media with 1µL of a 103 dilution obtained from a
0.5MacFarland bacterial suspension. Plates were read after 18, 20, 24 and 28
hours incubation. One strain was observed to have white colonies at 18 and
20 hours incubation, pink colonies were observed after 24 hours incubation.
The remaining 39 strains all showed pink colonies after 18, 20, 24 and 28
hours incubation.
To demonstrate the ability of MRSASelect to suppress the growth of
organisms other than MRSA, 31 strains of methicillin sensitive
Staphylococcus aureus, and 89 strains of coagulase negative Staphylococci
were tested by plating 1µL of a 102 dilution obtained from a 0.5 MacFarland
bacterial suspension on the medium. The 31 Methicillin Susceptible
Staphylococcus aureus tested showed no growth after 28 hours incubation. Of

the 89 coagulase negative strains tested, 8 MR S. epidermidis showed very
light pinkish colonies after 28 hours incubation. This data is acceptable for
assays of this type.
e. Analytical specificity:
Further Cross Reactivity testing was done with a panel of 34 organisms to
demonstrate that the extended incubation would not produce any reactivity
with other organisms. Organisms were inoculated onto MRSASelect with
10µL of a 101 dilution obtained from a 0.5 MacFarland suspension. Plates
were read at 18, 20, 24 and 28 hours incubation. No difference was noted at
18, 20, 24 and 28 hours incubation.
Interfering Substances – Medicinal Products
To determine the effect of potential interfering substances on the performance
of MRSASelect, representative samples of nasal sprays containing
phenylephrine hydrochloride commonly used in the United States were tested
to determine potential interference with growth of MRSA on MRSASelect.
Studies confirmed that the effect of nasal sprays were similar on MRSASelect
and as on non-selective Blood agar and thus not specific to MRSASelect. No
interference was observed as to the coloration of MRSA on MRSASelect nor
did the sprays impact the coloration of methicillin resistant coagulase negative
staphylococci. Sensitive strains were inhibited on MRSASelect.
Interfering Substances -- Transport Media
To determine the effect of potential interfering substances on the performance
of MRSASelect, several transport media commonly used in the United States
were tested. These various transport devices can be used effectively for the
transport of MRSA for the inoculation of MRSASelect. When observed, shift
of the bacterial count was comparable to blood agar and was considered
acceptable according to CLSI M40A.

3. Clinical Studies:
To demonstrate that the clinical performance of the device did not change, and
that the device can be read at various incubation times, studies were performed at
two clinical sites in the United States. Each site tested 100 fresh nasal swabs
comparing results of MRSASelect to routine culture methods: Trypticase Soy
Agar with 5% Blood, Coagulase and E-Test Oxacillin Susceptibility Testing.
MRSASelect plates were incubated at 35-37oC and read at 18, 20, 24 and 28
hours. Results were recorded. While there were minor differences noted, final
interpretation was consistent after 18, 20, 24, and 28 hours incubation. No
discordant samples were noted when comparing 18, 20, 24 and 28 hours
incubation. There were two samples that demonstrated very light pink pin-points
after 28 hours incubation (UMD 44849, UMD 852N.4). These colonies were
noted by the test site to be inconsistent with Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus
aureus colony morphology. Performance was acceptable and consistent with data
submitted in the original submission (K070361).

The three discordant samples noted were observed at only one site. No discordant
samples were noted at the second site. Site one reported that discordant samples
were further tested using BD IDI-MRSA PCR Assay. All samples were
confirmed to be PCR positive for MRSA. The data was not used to change the
initial results.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
In the original submission, 1772 samples were tested at two sites against
routine culture (blood agar plate, coagulase (Staphaurex), and susceptibility),
commercial available chromogenic agar plate, and MRSASelect. An
additional 1241 samples were tested at a third site against CHROMagar and
MRSASelect.

N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
a substantial equivalence decision.
