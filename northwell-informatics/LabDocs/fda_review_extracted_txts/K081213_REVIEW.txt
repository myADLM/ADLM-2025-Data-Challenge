L. Test Principle:
The single tube assay is performed by staining the specimen with the ready-to-use BD
FACSCount CD4 reagents. When whole blood is added to the reagent tube,
fluorochrome-labeled antibodies in the reagents bind specifically to white blood cell
surface antigens, and a fluorescent nuclear dye binds to the nucleated blood cells.
After a fixative solution is added, the sample is run on the instrument. During sample
acquisition, the cells are exposed to the laser light, which causes the fluorochrome-
labeled and fluorescently dyed cells to fluoresce. This fluorescent light provides the
information necessary for the instrument to identify and count the CD4 lymphocytes
and other (CD4 negative) lymphocytes. With the fluorescent nuclear dye bound to all
nucleated blood cells, CD14 and CD15 conjugates in the reagent move granulocytes
and monocytes away from the CD4 positive and negative lymphocytes population.
The reagent tube also contains a known number of fluorescent reference beads, which
are used as a fluorescence and quantitation standard for calculating the absolute count
of CD4 positive lymphocytes. A precise volume of whole blood is stained directly in
the reagent tube, and the results are provided automatically.
The processed sample is introduced to the FACSCount instrument and transported by
the sheath fluid to the flow cell as a narrow sample stream. Therein, the elements of
the sample, including cells, beads, and debris, are exposed to a focus laser beam. The
exposure causes the sample elements to emit fluorescent light, which is collected and
processed by the system.

SD and CV of the following measurements were computed for:
• CD4 absolute count
• CD4 percentage
Precision of the CD4 absolute count and CD4 percentage was characterized as
follows:
• Three BD FACSCount instruments and three operators were used.
• BD Multi-Check Control and Multi-Check CD4 Low control were
stain in duplicate with BD FACSCount CD4 reagent.
• Two separate runs per day for a period of 21 days.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
One set with eleven artificially-prepared normal blood specimens with equally
spaced CD4 T-lymphocyte concentrations was used in the linearity

evaluation. The study was designed to cover the entire reportable range of 50 -
5000 cells/µL. The artificially prepared 11 blood samples with different CD4

T-lymphocyte concentrations were stained in 3 replicates with FACSCount
CD4 reagents and acquired for evaluating assay linearity on three BD
FACSCount instruments with BD FACSCount CD4 Clinical software. The
linearity range for the FACSCount CD4 reagent was 37-5812 cells/µL for
CD4 absolute count.

A study was performed to generate product claim data for stability of whole
blood specimens and stained samples. Specimens were collected at the 2
external sites, and specimen that met protocol requirements were included in
the analysis.Each sample was collected in duplicates for each time point of
T0/T0, T24/T0, T24/T24, T0/T48 and T24/T48. The protocol was established
to cover the analytical range. The FACSCount CD4 reagents met the
acceptance criteria of Age of Blood and Age of Stain study and demonstrated
acceptable performance up to T24/T48. The Age of Blood claim will be 24
hours, and Age of Stain claim will be 48 hours in the product labeling.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A comparison study was performed at 3 sites to demonstrate an agreement of
the test method to the predicate by using a comparative evaluation of the same
specimens stained in parallel with the BD FACSCount CD4 Reagents and the
predicate. (Using lyse/ no-wash preparation procedure for predicate and no-
lyse/no-wash procedure for test method, according to each product package
insert). Samples were stained within 24 hours of venipuncture and analyzed
within 24 hours of staining. System configuration: Test: BD FACSCount
Flow Cytometer with BD FACSCount CD4 clinical software v1.0 with BD
FACSCount CD4 Reagents, Predicate: BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer with
Multiset software with BD TriTEST CD3/CD4/CD45 reagents with Trucount
absolute count tubes.
Four discrete bins were identified to provide an even distribution of data
across the range for CD4. See below:
