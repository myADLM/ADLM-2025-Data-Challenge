For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use on Abbott ARCHITECT i1000SR and i2000 SR instruments
I. Device Description:
The ARCHITECT iPhenobarbital Reagent Kit is comprised of two ready to use
solutions. The bottle bearing the “Microparticles Symbol” contains mouse
monoclonal anti-phenobarbital antibodies coated microparticles in TRIS buffer,
protein stabilizer and preservative. The bottle bearing the “Conjugate Symbol”
contains phenobarbital acridinium-labeled conjugate in MES buffer, protein stabilizer
and preservative.
ARCHITECT i instruments with STAT protocol capability (iX000SR) allow for
random and continuous access as well as priority and automated reset capability;
there is no difference in assay protocol in the STAT mode. The iPhenobarbital assay
is only indicated for use on i1000SR and i2000 SR instruments.
The ARCHITECT iPhenobarbital Calibrator Kit consists of 6 bottles which contain
human serum nonreactive for HBsAg, HIV-1 Ag or HIV-1 RNA, anti-HCV, and anti-
HIV-1/HIV-2, sodium azide, and different amounts of phenobarbital.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed on three ARCHITECT i2000SR
instruments, each using a different lot of reagent and calibrators. The
calibration curve generated for each reagent lot was performed on each
instrument by running the calibrators in replicates of two. The calibration
curve generated for each reagent lot was stored on each instrument for the
duration of the study.
The assay was run twice a day for 20 days using three levels of Abbott
Immunoassay-MCC (Liquid) and three levels of patient serum in replicates of
two, resulting in a total of 80 replicates for each instrument/lot control and

measurement range was evaluated with an additional 5-day precision study
performed on three ARCHITECT i2000 instruments using three lots of
S
reagents and one lot of calibrators. For the upper end study, a total of 20
replicates for each of the three reagent/instrument combinations were
generated. The assay was run twice a day for five days. High values targeted a
concentration above 70 μg/mL using spiked patient samples. For the low end
study each of 4 samples was tested over 5 days, 2 runs per day and 10 reps per
run for a total of 100 reps with each of the three reagent lots.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed assay range is 1.1 μg/mL – 80.0 μg/mL. Linearity within this
range was assessed by diluting five spiked serum and five spiked plasma
samples via an 11-level dilution series. Regression analysis of each dilution
series showed that the samples were linear. (Slope range = 0.98x to 1.03x,
intercept range = 0.14 to 0.56, R2 ≥ 0.998)
Recovery of these samples was determined by comparison of the measured
value to the theoretical value calculated according to the dilution factors. The

recovery for all serum samples was 96.2 – 109.4%; the recovery for all plasma
samples was 101.1 – 130.7%. Recoveries ≥ 110% were in the range between
1.1 and 5 μg/mL. Absolute recoveries in this lower assay range differed from
expected values by: 0.13 – 0.2 μg/mL for serum samples and 0.04 – 0.31
μg/mL for plasma samples.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ARCHITECT iPhenobarbital Calibrators B – F are traceable to the
Internal Reference Calibrators. Internal Reference Calibrators are
manufactured gravimetrically using USP Reference Standard Phenobarbital.
Calibrators A-F contain human plasma non-reactive for HBsAg, HIV-1 Ag or
HIV-1 RNA, anti-HCV, and anti-HIV-1/HIV-2.
Real time and accelerated stability testing support a claim that the reagents
and calibrators are stable for 12 months from manufacture when stored at 2 –
8°C. Opened reagent and calibrator may be stored at 2 – 8°C for up to 30
days.
The sponsor references a published reference for instructions on sample
stability under different conditions.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) and the limit of detection (LoD) were determined
using three instruments, three lots of reagent, and one control lot. Testing
consisted of 20 replicates of the A calibrator for each instrument and lot
combination (total n = 180) and 15 replicates each of five low level
phenobarbital samples. Calculations were performed according to CLSI EP17-
A. The LoB and LoD values were below the claimed lower limit of the assay
range, 1.1 μg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Substances: Serum samples spiked with 15 μg/mL or 40 μg/mL
phenobarbital were supplemented with the below interfering compounds.
Each test and control sample were run in replicates of 5 and the mean
interference was calculated as above:

Five specimens positive for Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and five specimens
positive for human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) were also evaluated for
interference by spiking them with 15 μg/mL or 40 μg/mL phenobarbital and
determining their recovery relative to unspiked samples. The mean percent
recovery for the RF samples ranged from 99.3% to 99.6%; the mean percent
recovery for the HAMA samples ranged from 97.0% to 100.1%.
Exogenous Compounds: For all cross-reactants tested, normal human serum
(NHS) samples were used. These serum samples were spiked with
phenobarbital to target concentrations at 15 and 40 μg/mL and cross-reactant.
The test and control spiked samples were run in replicates of five. Percent
Cross Reactivity was calculated as (Measured Value with Cross-Reactant) –
(Measured Value Control) * 100 Amount of Cross-Reactant. The mean %
Cross Reactivity and the grand mean % Cross Reactivity were also calculated.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The ARCHITECT iPhenobarbital assay for the ARCHITECT i2000 was
S
compared to the Roche AxSYM Phenobarbital assay by testing 132 frozen
serum samples. The sample range was 1.42 to 71.65 μg/mL with the
ARCHITECT iPhenobarbital assay and from 1.10 to 78.25 μg/mL with the
AxSYM Phenobarbital assay. Passing-Bablok regression analysis results
were:

(95% CI) (95% CI)
132 0.93 -0.44 >0.999
(0.91 – 0.95) (-0.80 – -0.18)
Bias analysis:
A bias analysis of ARCHITECT iPhenobarbital vs. AxSYM Phenobarbital
was performed on the same 132 specimens in the range of 1.42 μg/mL to
71.65 μg/mL and 1.10 μg/mL to 78.25 μg/mL, respectively. The average bias
exhibited by ARCHITECT vs. AxSYM in this study was –8.1% (95% CI -
23.9 - 7.7%). Within the typical therapeutic range of phenobarbital therapy
(10 to 40 μg/mL, as read in the AxSYM), the average bias was –8.7% (95%
CI -18.9 - 1.5%). The sponsor has added the following to the package insert:

CAUTION: Values obtained with different assay methods should not
be used interchangeably due to differences in assay methods and
cross-reactivity with metabolites, nor should correction factors be
applied. Therefore, consistent use of one assay for individual patients
is recommended. Each user should verify their own Expected Values
range based on clinical experience.
b. Matrix comparison:
The suitability of the specimen collection tubes in the table below were
evaluated using 20 spiked blood samples spanning the assay range. Samples
were aliquoted into each type of tube and tested in triplicate. Serum (no
additives) was used as the control. Recovery was calculated and the results are

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor has referenced the following expected values in the package insert:
Strong correlations have been shown between serum levels of
phenobarbital and both therapeutic effect and toxicity. Clinical
observations indicate that toxicity of phenobarbital is increased in patients
with renal disease. Phenobarbital toxicity primarily affects the central
nervous system. Toxic levels can lead to nystagmus, vertigo, and ataxia. A
small number of patients develop hypersensitivity to the drug. Some

patients under chronic treatment develop macrocytosis and megablastic
anemia as well as osteomalacia. Most patients will receive maximum
seizure control when serum levels of phenobarbital are in the range of 15 –
40 μg/mL.
CAUTION: Values obtained with different assay methods should not
be used interchangeably due to differences in assay methods and
cross-reactivity with metabolites, nor should correction factors be
applied. Therefore, consistent use of one assay for individual patients
is recommended. Each user should verify their own Expected Values
range based on clinical experience.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
