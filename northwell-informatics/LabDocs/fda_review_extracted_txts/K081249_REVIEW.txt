L. Test Principle:
The Dimension Vista® A2MAC method is based on the principle of nephelometry.
Proteins contained in human body fluids form immune complexes in an
immunochemical reaction with specific antibodies. These complexes scatter a beam
of light passed through the sample and the scattered light is measured. The intensity
of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in
the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known
concentration. The principle of nephelometry is used by the device as well as the
predicate.
The Dimension Vista® A2MAC method uses antisera to human a -macroglobulin
2
which is produced by immunization of rabbits with highly purified human a -
2
macroglobulin.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
This study was done over twenty days according to CLSI/NCCLS EP5-A2, at
a single site using a single instrument, a single reagent lot and two operators.
On each day of testing, each sample was run in duplicate, in two separate runs.
The test samples consisted of three levels of Dimension Vista ® Protein 1
Controls, two serum samples and two plasma samples.

The pools were established at levels below the expected range, at low and
high points in the expected range and at a level at the upper portion of the
analytical measuring range. The serum and plasma pools with high
concentrations were prepared by spiking a native pool with purified analyte.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the data consistent with
the recommendations of EP5-A2.

The linear range was determined according to CLSI, EP06-A. The linearity
study covered a range of 20.2 to 685 mg/dL (0.202 - 6.85 g/L). The linearity
studies were performed using a high serum sample (685 mg/dL). Serial
dilutions were prepared using System Diluent. Based on the results of this
testing and that from the Limit of Quantitation Study, the measuring range was
established.

d. Detection limit:
Three human serum samples were spiked with ERM® -DA470 with a known
concentration of α2-macroglobulin. Two concentrations were tested, 270
mg/dL (0.27 g/L) and 70 mg/dL (0.07 g/L). These levels were chosen to
challenge the low end of the analytical measuring range (1:20) and extended
low range (1:5) of the assay.
Five runs of triplicate determinations on each of three human serum samples
were tested on one day with a single reagent and calibrator lot and a single
instrument and operator.
The Limit of Quantitation was determined to be 6.8 mg/dL (0.068 g/L) using the
calculations described in CLSA Guideline EP17-A.
e. Analytical specificity:
Test samples were prepared by spiking the potential interferent into serum
except for rheumatoid factors. CLSI/NCCLS EP7-A2 was followed to select the
intereferent level.
The concentration of α2-macroglobulin in the serum samples tested ranged from
118 mg/dL - 392 mg/dL (1.18 g/L - 3.92 g/L).
Ten replicates of each serum sample with interferent were tested. All samples
that were tested for interference, except RF, were compared to a negative control
or baseline samples without the spiking material. Interference was defined as
"recovery" of a2-macroglobulin greater than ±10% of the baseline sample.
Recovery of a2-macroglobulin was in the range of 97 - 110% when compared to
the sample without the interfering compound. The acceptance criterion for the
bias (</= 10%) was met in all cases.

with no detectable RF were made and tested. The range of α2-macroglobulin in
the samples used for this study was 1.52 - 4.42 g/L. Recovery of α2-
macroglobulin was in the range of -2.7% to +0.7% for these samples. The

Sample stability studies were performed on samples stored at 2 - 8°C for seven
days and frozen at -20°C for three months to validate storage conditions.
There were a total of 143 samples consisting of 64 serum samples and 79

A single determination was run for each sample following CLSI/NCCLS EP9-
A2. Passing-Bablok regression analysis was used to analyze the data for the
initial measuring range. The regression statistics as follows:
Serum : Slope = 1.028, Intercept = +5.7 (0.057) mg/dL (g/L)
Correlation Coefficient (r) = 0.996 , n = 64
Plasma: Slope = 1.050, Intercept = +6.0 (0.060) mg/dL (g/L)
Correlation Coefficient (r) = 0.990, n = 79
Combined: Slope = 1.042, Intercept = +6.3 (0.063) mg/dL (g/L)
Correlation Coefficient (r) = 0.993, n = 143
b. Matrix comparison:
In addition to the method comparison studies, a separate study was done using
matched serum and plasma samples on the Dimension Vista® System. In this
study, matched samples of serum, lithium heparin, sodium heparin and EDTA
were tested on the Dimension Vista® System. The % recovery of α2-
macroglobulin for each plasma type was determined versus serum and a
regression analysis was done for each plasma type versus serum. The
acceptance criteria were for a correlation coefficient of ≥0.950 and for a
median of the normalized differences ≥ 7%. All samples met the acceptance
criterion.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
A literature reference was used for the expected range. The expected range
interval is 130 - 300 mg/dL (1.30 - 3.0 g/L) for serum and plasma.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
