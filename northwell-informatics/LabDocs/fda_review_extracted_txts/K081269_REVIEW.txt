L. Test Principle:
The Avie A1c test system utilizes immunochemistry and general chemistry to quantify %A1c
(glycated hemoglobin) in whole blood. The test consists of two distinct quantitative areas of
measurement. The first area is a chamber where the met-hemoglobin is photometrical read at
420 nm. The optical density of the met-hemoglobin is proportional to the concentration of
total hemoglobin. The second area is a mixing chamber where the diluted blood is mixed
with anti hemoglobin antibodies conjugated to blue microparticles. After a predetermined
time the microparticle mixture is automatically released onto a reagent strip where the
reacted and un-reacted microparticle species are separated and read optically. The
concentration of those species is used to calculate the amount of A1c.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted in-house by testing aliquots from a frozen blood
sample with normal HbA1c and another frozen sample with elevated HbA1c. The
samples were assayed twice a day for twenty days by multiple operators. The results
are presented in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity range for the assay was assessed by inter-mixing a low blood sample
with a high blood sample to make two sets of samples, one containing 8 and the other
containing 7. The samples were assayed and the percent recoveries were calculated.
The measuring range of the assay is 5-14%. The results are presented below:
Sample Expected % A1C Observed % A1C Recovery
1 4.9 5.2 107%
2 6.2 6.6 107%

6 12.6 12 95%
7 14 13.4 96%
y = 1.009 + 0.6865 R2 = 0.993
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor has documented traceability to the NGSP’s recommended accuracy base for
HbA1c by performing a direct comparison with a Secondary Reference Laboratory (SRL)
using 40 fresh human specimens. At this time, the assay is NGSP certified. However,
NGSP certification expires at the end of one year. For current certifications see the NGSP
website at: http://www.ngsp.org/prog/index2.html
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 5 to 14% HbA1c (see linearity section above).
e. Analytical specificity:
Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could interfere
with the assay. Potential interferents were tested at their published highest therapeutic

levels using two whole blood (one with normal and an abnormal A1c, both have
normal hemoglobin level) samples. The sponsor states that recovery within 10% of
the control results was considered to be non-interfering Results are presented in the
table below:

The data demonstrates that the Avie A1c test system is sensitive to high levels of
Glybenclamide and Metformin. These interferents are noted in the labeling.
To evaluate effect of hemoglobin concentrations, two whole blood (with normal A1c
and abnormal A1c) samples were prepared to obtain five different hemoglobin
concentration. The sponsor states that recovery within 10% of medium total
Hemoglobin (12 mg/dL) was considered to be non-interfering. The results are
presented in the table below:
Sample Total Hb % A1c %

g/dL.

representing normal and diabetic A1C were incubated at 37° C for 3-4 hours in the
presence of 1400 mg/dL glucose. Sponsor states that recovery within 10% of control
sample was considered to be non-interfering. The sponsor concluded that labile A1C
concentrations across the assay range do not interfere with the assay.
To evaluate the effect of hemoglobin variants such as Hgb S, C, F, D and E, twelve
samples collected from patients with known hemoglobin genetic variants were tested.
Sponsor states that a substance was considered to show no significant interference if
the difference between test sample and the blank sample was <10%. Samples
containing HbS and HbE showed no interference. Samples containing HbC, F and D
showed significant interference; this information is in the limitations section of the
labeling.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The lay-user study was performed at Point-of-Care site with a total of 60 lay-users
and three point of care testers. The lay-users ranged in age, education and were
equally divided between males and females; and were type-1 diabetics, type-2
diabetics or non-diabetics. Also, samples previously collected were used to help span
the range of the assay. Each participant performed a finger stick and tested their blood
using the instructions. A trained professional then performed another finger stick,
testing the blood on the same lot of test cartridges. Venous samples were than drawn
and compared to the results obtained on the Bayer A1c Now Plus. A questionnaire
from the lay-users indicated that the device was easy to use. The results are presented
below:

N. Instrument Name:
Avie A1c Reader
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each diluent solution vial and reagent test cartridge are single use and must be replace in
order to perform a new test.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ____X___ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The sample is collected using the blood collection device, which is a pipette
manufactured to draw the exact sample volume from a finger-stick. The sample is than
dispensed into the diluent vial. The vial is inverted 5 times to mix the blood with the
diluent. Three drops of the mixture are added to the application well of the cartridge
(which has already been inserted into the instrument).
5. Calibration:
The Avie A1c reader is factory calibrated and is not field or user adjustable.
6. Quality Control:
The Avie A1c Reader has an internal control systems that performs operational self-
checks (optics and software) when the poser is turned on. If a malfunction is detected the
reader will display an error message. MEC Dynamics recommends that external controls
be tested prior to home testing or at the start of each testing day, upon receipt of each new
shipment or use of a new lot of cartridges, whenever storage room conditions have been
above 28°C, to become familiar with the process or to perform training or retraining of
testing personnel and whenever Avie A1c results do not match other clinical findings or
symptoms, The sponsor recommends that the user contact them for recommendations on
the external QC materials to use.
