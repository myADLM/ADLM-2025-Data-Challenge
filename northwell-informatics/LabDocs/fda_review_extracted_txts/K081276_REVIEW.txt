b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
ABX PENTRA Glucose HK CP
Without Post-dilution
Linearity determination was based upon CLSI EP6-A using aqueous glucose
standards. The concentrations of the standards covered the measuring range
with the lowest standard at 3.92 and the highest standard at 1017.2 mg/dL.
Each level was measured 4 times. Following the CLSI document, first,
second and third order regressions were calculated. It was determined that the
third order regression represented the best fit. Based on these studies, the
sponsor has demonstrated linearity for the ABX Pentra Glucose HK CP from
3.9 -900 mg/dL. The sponsor is claiming a measuring range of 3.9 mg/dL -
900 mg/dL.
With Post-dilution
The Pentra 400 performs automatic dilutions (1/3) on urine glucose samples
if the value is > 900 mg/dL up to a limit of 2700 mg/dL. A study was
performed comparing manual dilutions to the Pentra 400 automated dilutions
using human urine samples spiked with glucose. Samples ranged from
1177.66 mg/dL to 2629.54 mg/dL. Manual and automated dilution factors
were the same and each sample was run in duplicate. Bias between the two
methods was calculated and was acceptable.
ABX PENTRA Uric Acid CP
Without Post-dilution
Linearity determination was based upon CLSI EP6-A using 11 uric acid
solutions. The concentrations of the solutions were prepared based on the
dilution of the highest concentration solution with a solution near the low limit

of detection. The concentrations of the standards ranged from 5.19 to 283.37
mg/dL. Each level was measured 4 times. Following the CLSI document,
first, second and third order regressions were calculated. It was determined
that the second order regression represented the best fit. Based on these
studies, the sponsor is claiming a measuring range for the ABX Pentra Uric
Acid CP from 5.2-252 mg/dL.
With Post-Dilution
The Pentra 400 performs automatic dilutions (1/3) on urine uric acid samples
if the value is > 252 mg/dL up to a limit of 756 mg/dL. A study was
performed comparing manual dilutions to the Pentra 400 automated dilutions
using human urine samples spiked with uric acid. Samples ranged from
253.97 mg/dL to 712.96 mg/dL. Manual and automated dilution factors were
the same and each sample was run in duplicate. Bias between the two
methods was calculated and was acceptable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: ABX PENTRA Urine Control L/H
The values of the ABX PENTRA Controls are assigned from the ABX
PENTRA calibrator, reagents and analyzers following a standardized protocol.
A minimum of 6 ABX PENTRA 400 analyzers are used.
Target values for each level of control are the median of the combined results
from the 6 analyzers (n=150). The percentage of deviation between the
lowest device mean and the highest device mean must be less than 10%. The
coefficients of variation (CV) are calculated and ranked by value for each
analyzer. The confidence range generally applied is +/-3 times the standard
deviation around the highest CV. Once the target value and confidence
interval have been determined, the control is run on 1 ABX Pentra 400 for
confirmation.

vials stored at 2-8°C, tightly closed when not in-use.
d. Detection limit:
ABX PENTRA Glucose HK CP
Physiological water (0.9% NaCl) was assayed 60 times on 2 different Pentra
400 for glucose. Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined in accordance with
CLSI Guideline EP17-A “Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection
and Limits of Quantitation ; Approved Guideline”. The LoB is 1.95 mg/dL.
Limit of Detection (LoD) was derived from assaying 4 samples with
concentrations between LoB and LoB x 4, 20 times. The LoD is 2.9 mg/dL.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined by assaying a range of low
concentration samples 12 times. The LoQ was defined as the first
concentration sample where the CV% was lower than 15% and the relative
bias within +/-10%. The LoQ is 3.3 mg/dL.
ABX PENTRA Uric Acid CP
Physiological water (0.9% NaCl) was assayed 90 times on 3 different Pentra
400 for uric acid. Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined in accordance with
CLSI Guideline EP17-A “Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection
and Limits of Quantitation ; Approved Guideline”. The LoB is 2.33 mg/dL.
Limit of Detection (LoD) was derived from assaying 4 samples with
concentrations between LoB and LoB x 4, 20 times. The LoD is 3.49 mg/dL.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined by assaying a range of low
concentration samples 12 times. The LoQ was defined as the first
concentration sample where the CV% was lower than 15% and the relative
bias was within +/-10%. The LoQ is 5.15 mg/dL. The claimed LoQ for uric
acid is 5.2 mg/dl
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous interference was determined in according to the following
protocol: Interfering substances in solution were added to pooled human
10

--- Page 11 ---
urine at two different glucose or uric acid concentrations (normal and high).
Each sample was then serially diluted with the same neat base urine to adjust
the glucose or uric acid concentrations. The sponsor determined that greater
than 10% deviation from the target glucose or uric acid values constituted
interference.
Exogeneous interference from pH was tested for glucose at levels of 3.3, 7.2
and 10.4.
ABX PENTRA Glucose HK CP
The conclusions were:
Hemoglobin up to 500 mg/dL-5g/L (290 micmol/L ) does not interfere with
glucose determination on the ABX Pentra 400.
Total Bilirubin up to 29.3mg/dL (500 micmol/L ) does not interfere with
glucose determination on the ABX Pentra 400.
Ascorbic Acid up to 6.2 mg/dL (350 micmol/L ) does not interfere with
glucose determination on the ABX Pentra 400.
Specific Gravity in the range of 1.005 to 1.035: there is no interference with
glucose determination on the ABX Pentra 400.
pH between 3.3-10.4 does not interfere with glucose determination on the
ABX Pentra 400.
ABX PENTRA Uric Acid CP
The conclusions were:
Hemoglobin up to 500 mg/dL-5g/L (290 micmol/L ) does not interfere with
uric acid determination on the ABX Pentra 400.
Direct Bilirubin up to 33.7 mg/dL (500 micmol/L ) does not interfere with uric
acid determination on the ABX Pentra 400.
Ascorbic Acid up to 6.2 mg/dL (350 micmol/L ) does not interfere with uric
acid determination on the ABX Pentra 400.
Specific Gravity in the range of 1.005 to 1.035: there is no interference with
uric acid determination on the ABX Pentra 400.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
ABX PENTRA Glucose HK CP
A method comparison was performed between the ABX Pentra 400 and the
predicate device on 105 human urine samples (80 native, 25 spiked). The
samples ranged from 5.22 mg/dL to 898.92 mg/dL and were run in duplicate

between the predicate and candidate devices gave the following regression
equation: y=0.96 + 0.84, r2 = 0.9970.

A method comparison was performed between the ABX Pentra 400 and the
predicate device on 113 human urine samples (76 native, 37 spiked) across the
measuring range (5.3-248.8 mg/dL). Analysis of point to point comparisons
