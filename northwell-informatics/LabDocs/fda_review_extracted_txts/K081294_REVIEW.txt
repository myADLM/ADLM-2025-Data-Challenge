L. Test Principle:
The CardioPhase hsCRP latex reagent is a suspension of uniform polystyrene latex
particles coated with anti-CRP antibody. When serum or plasma containing CRP is
mixed with the latex reagent, agglutination takes place resulting in an increase in
turbidity. This turbidity is measured at 571 nm. The CRP concentration in serum or
plasma is determined from a calibration curve that is generated with the calibrator
materials.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run and total imprecision were evaluated by testing five serum pools
and three levels of control materials. Each sample was assayed 2 times per run
and 2 runs per day for 10 days. All runs were done with one instrument
calibration. Precision estimates were computed according to CLSI document

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The assay range of this method is from 0.16 mg/L to 10 mg/L based on
Functional Sensitivity (Limit of Quantitation, LOQ) see detection limit below,
to the CRP concentration of the highest level linearity.
The linearity of this method was evaluated following the guidelines of CLSI
EP6-A protocol where recombinant CRP was spiked into pooled human serum
for the high CRP level, which was then diluted with a zero pool to make nine
equally spaced linearity pools within the assay range. The observed CRP
results on the ADVIA 1650 were compared with the expected CRP
concentration. The resulting recovery information is presented in the table
below:

Testing the nine samples, the resulting linear regression equation was
obtained: Slope = 0.9857 (0.9651 to 1.0062), Intercept = - 0.0303 (-.1857 to
0.1252), r = 0.9997

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability to CRM 470 is claimed for the calibrator materials.
The ADVIA® Chemistry CardioPhaseTM High Sensitivity C-Reactive
Protein (hsCRP) Calibrators are used to calibrate the hsCRP method. The
calibrators consist of six (6) levels of protein stabilized matrices containing
varying concentrations of recombinant human CRP (synthesized in bacteria -
not human source). The Calibrators have targeted expected values (lot
specific) of 0, 0.53, 1.05, 1.58, 5.25, and 10.50 mg/L, and these values are
traceable to IRMM reference material CRM 470.
Shelf Life Stability
The ADVIA Chemistry hsCRP calibrator materials have a shelf stability of 18
months stored at 2 – 8oC, and have open-vial stability of 60 days when stored
at 2 – 8oC.
Real Time:
The Shelf Life of the ADVIA Chemistry hsCRP calibrator materials was
evaluated with Real Time Stability testing at the recommended storage
temperature (2 – 8oC). Two lots of calibrators were tested at Day 0 (QC
release) and at 19 months (for one lot) and at 117 weeks (or 27 months for
another lot), respectively.
Open Vial:
Open Vial Stability of the ADVIA Chemistry hsCRP calibrator materials was
tested up to 60 days (64 days for the 2nd lot). On Day 0, calibrators were used

to calibrate ADVIA 1650 hsCRP method, and recoveries of the controls were
obtained using this calibration. The opened calibrator vials (each level) were
then recapped and stored at 2 – 8oC. At each checkpoint following Day 0,
these stored, opened vials of calibrators were used for calibration and control
recovery, and compared to control recoveries from calibration with freshly
opened vials of calibrators.
The sponsor’s acceptance criteria are as follows: less than + 10% difference in
control recovery using calibration with open calibrator materials versus
calibration with fresh calibrator materials
d. Detection limit:
The functional sensitivity (Limit of Quantitation) of this assay is 0.16 mg/L,
which is the lowest CRP concentration in a sample where total imprecision is
less than 10%.
CRM 470 material was serially diluted to 0.99 mg/L, 0.495 mg/L, 0.247
mg/L, 0.124 mg/L and 0.062 mg/L. Each level was run at 8 reps/run, 5 runs
total (40 reps total) on the ADVIA 1650. %CV and % deviation from the
target were calculated. To determine the CRP concentration at which 20%
deviation of accuracy and 10% precision and the observed recovery vs.
deviation from target data was plotted.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference was evaluated by spiking human serum pools with hemoglobin
(from lysed human red blood cells), unconjugated (free) bilirubin, conjugated
bilirubin, triglycerides (Intralipid) and Rheumatoid Factor (RF). Multiple
levels of each of the interfering substances were tested at a clinically relevant
CRP concentration. Samples were assayed in duplicate. The results for each
analyzer are presented in the labeling. There was no significant interference
for bilirubin up to 30 mg/dL, for hemolysis up to 500 mg/dL, lipemia up to
750 mg/dL and rheumatoid factor up to 1040 IU/mL.
All results passed Siemens Diagnostics internal acceptance criteria for
interference of ≤10% up to the acceptable level of interferent.
The labeling includes a limitation that there is a potential that heterophilic
antibodies may interfere with this method. Also, the labeling includes a
statement that the performance of this method has not been evaluated with
patients containing heterophilic antibodies.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The ADVIA Chemistry CardioPhase hsCRP correlation studies were
performed on the ADVIA 1650, against the Siemens CardioPhase High
Sensitivity CRP assay on the BNII instrument.
The correlation studies were done over 7 days using 167 patient serum
samples. Testing was done in duplicate on the ADVIA 1650 and in singlicate
on the BNII; the data was processed using only the first result from the
ADVIA 1650 (singlicate).

The method comparison studies between the device and the former Dade
Behring CardioPhase™ hsCRP on the BNII system (this predicate device was
used in the clinical studies supporting an indication for cardiovascular use)

Not Applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected values provided in the labeling for healthy individuals as noted in
the literature are typically ≤ 3 mg/L.
The below referenced AHA/CDC Scientific Statement concerning inflammation
and cardiovascular markers also reports that CRP values < 1 mg/L are low risk for
cardiovascular disease prediction, values between 1 – 3 mg/L are average risk for
cardiovascular disease prediction and values > 3 mg/L are high risk for
cardiovascular disease prediction.
Pearson TA, Mensah GA, Alexander RW, et al. Markers of inflammation and cardiovascular
diseases; application to clinical and public health practice: A statement for healthcare
professionals from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Heart
Association. Circulation 2003; 107:499-511.
Studies performed by Siemens on 190 apparently healthy volunteers yielded a
median serum CRP concentration of 1.21 mg/L and an upper 97.5th percentile
serum CRP concentration of 7.59 mg/L.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
