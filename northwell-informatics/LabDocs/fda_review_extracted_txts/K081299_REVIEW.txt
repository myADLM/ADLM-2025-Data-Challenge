L. Test Principle:
Proteins contained in human body fluids form immune complexes in an
immunochemical reaction with specific antibodies. These complexes scatter a beam
of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional
to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by
comparison with a standard of known concentration.

The performance characteristics for Transferrin in serum and plasma are available in

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
CLSI EP5-A2 was followed. During each day of testing, two separate runs,
with two test samples, for each test material, were analyzed for 20 days. The
urine matrix precision data are attached below. The test samples consisted of
two additional urine pools at different concentrations, and the Dimension
Vista® System Protein 3 Control. One operator, one reagent and one
instrument were used.
TRF for urine:
Mean Standard Deviation mg/dL [mg/L] (% CV)
Material mg/dL [mg/L] Repeatability Within-Lab
PROT3 CON 1.53 [15.30] 0.04 [0.42] (2.7) 0.06 [0.61] (4.0)
Urine pool 0.59 [5.89] 0.02 [0.20] (3.4) 0.02 [0.23] (3.8)
Urine pool 2.7 [26.99] 0.05 [0.48] (1.8) 0.09 [0.89] (3.3)
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed according to CLSI EP06-A using one urine
sample (concentration 31.6 mg/L) serially diluted with System Diluent and
run in replicates of 5 per dilution level. The TRF-U measuring range is 2.00 -
31.0 mg/L. Linearity for the extended measuring range was evaluated as well.
Linearity data using weighted least squares regression analysis is shown
below:
Sample range Slope Y-intercept (mg/L) Correlation n
(mg/L) (95%CI) (95%CI) Coefficient
(1.57 to 31.44) 1.009 ± 0.008 0.129 ± 0.135 0.9999 12
(20.1 to 334.9) 0.955 ± 0.025 1.755 ± 1.478 0.9993 12
A test report message (flag or comment) is provided for the results that fall
outside the measuring ranges.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrator and control are traceable to protein reference preparation
ERM®-DA470 (CRM 470).
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was established using a testing protocol outlined
in CLSI EP17-A Section 5.1 and a total analytical error of 30% based on
imprecision experience for this transferrin assay and consistent with similar
plasma proteins. Three independent samples at the target concentration were
assayed in 5 runs, three replicates per run. Testing performed in one day with
a single reagent lot, calibrator lot, instrument and operator. The LoQ was
determined to be 2 mg/L (=0.2 mg/dL).

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference Studies:
Test samples were prepared by spiking the potential interferent into Urine.
Urine transferrin concentrations ranged from 7.22 - 23.83 mg/L. Interference
testing was performed based on CLSI EP7-A2 to determine the effect of
various endogenous and exogenous substances on the Dimension Vista®
System TRF assay. For all interferents the percent bias was determined by
testing a control sample without the interferent and comparing it to the value
obtained from a test sample to which the potential interferent had been added.
For urine samples, ten replicates were tested for each substance. Recovery for
the interferents tested ranged from 95% to 109% and met the acceptance
criteria of bias <10%.
Substance Tested Substance concentration TRF in urine % Bias
Hemoglobin 115 mg/dL 5.00 mg/L –5%
25.00 mg/L +5%
Bilirubin (conjugated) 3 mg/dL 5.00 mg/L +7%
25.00 mg/L +8%
Bilirubin (unconjugated) 2 mg/dL 5.00 mg/L –5%
25.00 mg/L 0%
The following substances do not interfere with the TRF method when present
in urine at the concentrations indicated. Inaccuracies (biases) due to these
substances are less than 10 % at transferrin concentrations of 0.72 mg/dL to
2.38 mg/dL [7.22 mg/L to 23.83 mg/L].
Substance Test Concentration SI Units
Acetone 1000 mg/dL 217 mmol/L

pH: Effect of pH on TRF-U was evaluated. Ten replicates of a urine sample
were evaluated across a pH range 3 to 9. Sample bias was less than 10%.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Matched urine samples containing transferrin (sample concentration range

predicate device following CLSI EP9-A2. A total of 63 urine samples were
analyzed in singlicate (33 native ranging 2.0 to 24.4 mg/L, and 30 spiked
ranging 10 to 20.7 mg/L). Passing-Bablok regression yielded the following
statistics:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The concentration of transferrin in urine of healthy individuals is below the
detection limit of detection for this method (less than 0.20 mg/dL [2.00 mg/L])
and is based on the following literature reference Rifai N, Gubar K, Silverman
LM. Immunoturbidimetry: an attractive technique for the determination of urinary
albumin and transferrin. Clin Biochem 1987; 20:179-81. This was confirmed by
performing a reference interval transference study evaluating TRF-U levels in 20
apparently healthy adults.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
