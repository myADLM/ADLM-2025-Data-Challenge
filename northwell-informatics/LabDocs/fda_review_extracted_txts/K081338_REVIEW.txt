L. Test Principle:
The Elecsys Anti-CCP immunoassay is a two step IgG-capture test principle
immunoassay with streptavidin-coated microparticles and electrochemiluminescence
detection. Results are determined using a calibration curve that is generated
specifically on each instrument by a 2 point calibration and a master curve provided
with the reagent bar code.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the Elecsys® Anti-CCP Test System was evaluated on Elecsys®
2010/cobas e® 411 Immunoassay Analyzer according to CLSI EP5-A2
guideline. The protocol consisted of testing 2 replicates of each control (PC =
PreciControl) or sample (HS = human serum) per run, 2 runs per day for 21
days. Within run precision and total precision was calculated according to
EP5-A2.

A 10 day inter-assay precision study with a sample at 664 U/mL was also

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the Elecsys® Anti-CCP was evaluated on the Elecsys®
2010/cobas e® 411 Immunoassay Analyzer by diluting three high through
medium analyte level serum sample pools with varying amounts of low-level
serum. Pure samples (0% and 100%) were run n=6 with mean measured
value reported. The regression equations of the three pools are as follows:
Sample 1: y=1.0029x-4.1733; r2=0.9992
Sample 2: y=0.9913x+0.5146; r2=0.9992
Sample 3: y=1.0261x+5.4971; r2=0.9944
The measuring range is 8-1000 U/mL (defined by the limit of detection and
the maximum of the master curve). Performance information at the low end
of the assay range is summarized in the Detection Limit section below. Roche
has performed linearity testing to cover the low end of the measuring range.
The linear regression is y=0.9338x+1.2276; r2=0.9904.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no recognized material for anti-CCP. The Elecsys® Anti-CCP test is
standardized against a commercially available anti-CCP assay.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank and limit of detection were determined in accordance with
the CLSI EP17-A requirements.
The limit of blank (≤ 7 U/mL) is the 95th percentile value from n ≥ 60
measurements of analyte free samples over several independent series. The
limit of blank corresponds to the concentration below which analyte-free
samples are found with a probability of 95%. The distribution of values for
five zero-level human serum samples have been determined on two Elecsys®
2010 / cobas e® 411 Immunoassay Analyzer over 3 days, 2 runs per day.
The limit of detection (≤8 U/mL) is determined based on the limit of blank
and the standard deviation of low concentration samples. The limit of
detection corresponds to the lowest analyte concentration which can be
detected (value above the limit of blank with a probability of 95%). The
distribution of values for five low-level human serum samples have been
determined on two Elecsys® 2010 / cobas e® 411 Immunoassay Analyzer over
3 days, 2 runs per day.
The limit of quantitation (8 U/mL) is the lowest analyte concentration that can
be reproducibly measured with a between-run coefficient of variation of ≤
20%. It has been determined using low concentration anti-CCP samples.
Nine human serum sample pools with concentrations ranging from 6.57 to
27.2 U/mL were tested once per day, for 10 days.
e. Analytical specificity:
Effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of endogenous interfering
substances using the Elecsys® Anti-CCP Immunoassay was determined on
4

Elecsys® 2010/cobas e® 411 Immunoassay Analyzer using natural (low
analyte concentration) and spiked serum sample pools.
The assay is unaffected by:
• Bilirubin: < 25 mg/dL
• Hemoglobin: < 0.5 g/dL
• Intralipid: < 1500 mg/dL
• Biotin: < 30 ng/mL
• Rheumatoid Factors: < 150 IU/mL
Hook effect:
No hook effect was detected up to concentration of 7000 U/mL.
f. Assay cut-off:
In cohorts of 792 confirmed rheumatoid arthritis patients, 420 asymptomatic
healthy individuals and 907 patients with other rheumatic and non-rheumatic
disorders, an optimal cut-off of 17 U/mL was determined. At this cut-off the
sensitivity was calculated at 67.7% and the specificity at 97.0%. The
calculated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve had an area under the
curve (AUC) of 0.85.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed to compare the Elecsys Anti-CCP
values obtained with both the Elecsys® 2010/cobas e® 411 and MODULAR
ANALYTICS E170/cobas e® 601 Immunoassay Analyzer to the values
obtained with the predicate device Eurodiagnostica IMMUNOSCAN RA
Anti-CCP.
Cohort:
Non-RA cohort:
Negative cohort consisting of 319 apparently healthy individuals and 673
patients with non-rheumatoid arthritis diseases; in total 992 patients from two
sites.
RA Cohort:
Positive cohort consisting of 614 patients with clinical diagnosis of
rheumatoid arthritis based on the ARA (American Rheumatology Association)
1987 Revised Criteria for the Classification of Rheumatoid Arthritis.
1606 samples tested using a cut-off of ≥ 17 U/mL for the Elecsys Anti-CCP

Total Percent Agreement = 97.3% (95% CI = 96.3-98.0)
b. Matrix comparison:
The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of anticoagulants with
Elecsys Anti-CCP Immunoassay was determined on Elecsys 2010/cobas e 411
Immunoassay Analyzer by comparing values obtained from samples drawn
into Serum, Li- and K3-EDTA-Heparin plasma primary tubes. Potential
effects are assessed by Passing/Bablok regression analysis. The following was
found:
Serum/K3-EDTA: y=1.10x-0.977 (anti-CCP = 8.37-473 U/mL, n=31)
Serum/Li-Heparin: y=1.03x-0.143 (anti-CCP = 8.37-769 U/mL, n=33)
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical sensitivity and specificity:
The clinical sensitivity and specificity were determined by testing 792
confirmed rheumatoid arthritis patients, 420 asymptomatic healthy individuals
and 907 patients with other rheumatic and non-rheumatic disorders. Results
showed sensitivity and specificity of 67.7% and 97.0% respectively.
b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. is not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Results ≥ 17 U/mL are considered positive; see assay cut off
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected value in the normal population is negative.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
