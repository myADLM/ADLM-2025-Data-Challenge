See Indications for Use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
For in vitro diagnostic use only.
The DRI Methadone Metabolite (100/300) Assay is intended for the qualitative
and semi-quantitative determination of the presence of Methadone Metabolite (2-
ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine or EDDP) in human urine at
cutoffs of 100 and 300 ng/mL.
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result.
Gas chromatography / Mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory
method. Clinical and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of
abuse test result, particularly when preliminary results are used. Tests for
methadone metabolite cannot distinguish between abused drugs and certain
prescribed medications. Certain foods or medications may interfere with test for

The DRI Methadone Metabolite Calibrators are intended for the calibration of the
DRI Methadone Metabolite (100/300) Assay.
The DRI Methadone Metabolite Controls are intended for use in the DRI
Methadone Metabolite (100/300) Assay to detect and monitor systematic
deviations from accuracy resulting from reagent or instrument defects.

Methods
L. Test Principle:
The DRI Methadone Metabolite (100/300) Assay utilizes liquid ready-to-use reagents
and calibrators. The assay uses specific antibodies that can detect EDDP in human
urine without cross-reactivity to the parent drug methadone. The assay is based on
competition between a drug labeled with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PDH) and free drug from the sample for a fixed number of specific antibody
binding sites. In the presence of free drug from the sample, the free drug occupies the
antibody binding sites, allowing the drug-labeled G6PDH to interact with the
substrate, resulting in enzyme activity. In the absence of free drug from the sample,
the specific antibody binds the drug labeled with G6PDH and causes a decrease in
enzyme activity. This phenomenon creates a direct relationship between drug
concentration in urine and enzyme activity. This enzyme activity is determined
spectrophotometrically at 340 nm by measuring its ability to convert nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
An EDDP solution (1 mg/mL) was added to each of four samples obtained
from a human urine sample pool to achieve concentrations that span the assay
range. The samples were tested for precision in qualitative and semi-
quantitative modes. Following a CLSI (EP5A) precision protocol, samples
were tested in 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 20 days, total N=80.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The assay linearity was determined by testing the recoveries of a series of
samples diluted from a high concentration EDDP sample. A high patient urine
sample containing around 1000 ng/mL EDDP was serially diluted with
analyte-free urine in 10% increments and tested by 5 replicates in semi-
quantitative mode. All samples were recovered within ± 10% of the expected
value and the r-value was 0.9990.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators and controls are tested on Hitachi 917 analyzers by two runs
against a reference (primary) set of calibrators and controls, N=5 for all
samples. The acceptance criteria require that replicates have rate imprecision
less than 1.5% CV, rate difference between the secondary and the primary
calibrators and controls must be within 3%, and concentration of the
calibrators and controls must be within 10% error of the nominal values by
GC/MS. Calibrators and controls are assigned nominal values if validation

results meet acceptance criteria. The assigned values for the calibrators and
controls are traceable to the Cerilliant methadone standard catalogue E-022
and are verified by GC/MS. Real time and accelerated stability studies were
conducted; protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be
acceptable. These studies support the manufacturer’s stability claims. Real
time studies are ongoing.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable. This assay is qualitative and semi-quantitative only.
Semiquantitative values should be used to estimate concentration for dilution
purposes only.
e. Analytical specificity:
The cross-reactivity of parent drug, metabolites, and drugs commonly found
in specimens was evaluated by adding known amounts of each substance to
methadone metabolite-free urine. A compound producing negative results
compared to the 100 ng/mL and 300 ng/mL cutoff calibrator was considered
to have no cross-reactivity. The results of the study are presented below.

negative result at the concentrations listed below.
