DECISION SUMMARY
ASSAY ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
k081483

Request for removal of the requirement for culture confirmation of negative assay results for
Influenza A, Influenza A subtypes H1 and H3, hMPV, and Rhinovirus. Addition of the
bioMerieux EasyMag nucleic acid purification method.

See k063765
E. Applicant:
Luminex Molecular Diagnostics Inc.
F. Proprietary and Established Names:
xTAG™ Respiratory Viral Panel
Common Name: Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) Multiplex Nucleic Acid Detection Assay
G. Regulatory Information:
1. Regulation section:
21 CFR 866.3980, Respiratory viral panel multiplex nucleic acid assay
2. Classification:
Class II
3. Product code:
OCC, OEM, OEP
4. Panel:
Microbiology (83)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The xTAG™ Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) is a qualitative nucleic acid multiplex test
intended for the simultaneous detection and identification of multiple respiratory virus nucleic
acids in nasopharyngeal swabs from individuals suspected of respiratory tract infections. The
following virus types and subtypes are identified using RVP: Influenza A, Influenza A subtype
H1, Influenza A subtype H3, Influenza B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus subtype A, Respiratory
Syncytial Virus subtype B, Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza 2, and Parainfluenza 3 virus,
Human Metapneumovirus, Rhinovirus, and Adenovirus. The detection and identification of
specific viral nucleic acids from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of respiratory
infection aids in the diagnosis of respiratory viral infection if used in conjunction with other
clinical and laboratory findings. It is recommended that specimens found to be negative for
Influenza B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus subtype A and B, Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza 2,
Parainfluenza 3 and Adenovirus, after examination using RVP be confirmed by cell culture.
Negative results do not preclude respiratory virus infection and should not be used as the sole
basis for diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions. Positive results do not rule out
bacterial infection, or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the
definite cause of disease. The use of additional laboratory testing (e.g. bacterial culture,
immunofluorescence, radiography) and clinical presentation must be taken into consideration
in order to obtain the final diagnosis of respiratory viral infection.

Due to seasonal prevalence, performance characteristics for Influenza A/H1 were
established primarily with retrospective specimens.
The RVP assay cannot adequately detect Adenovirus species C, or serotypes 7a and 41. The
RVP primers for detection of rhinovirus cross-react with enterovirus. A rhinovirus reactive
result should be confirmed by an alternate method (e.g. cell culture).
Performance characteristics for Influenza A Virus were established when Influenza A/H3 and
A/H1 were the predominant Influenza A viruses in circulation. When other Influenza A viruses
are emerging, performance characteristics may vary. If infections with a novel Influenza A
virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria
recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate
infection control precautions for novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to a state or local
health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL
3+ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

Reagents Required But Not Provided
Reagents required to perform testing with the device include ancillary reagents for which
specific lots have been qualified by Luminex Molecular Diagnostics (LMD) and incorporated
in the LMD quality system, for use with the xTAG™ RVP. The xTAG™ RVP product
performance requires that only qualified ancillary reagent lots be used with the device. Any
lots not specifically qualified by LMD for use with xTAG™ RVP are not validated for use
with this assay, and may cause erroneous results. To find an up to date list of Qualified
Ancillary Reagents log onto Luminex website Support page
https://oraweb.luminexcorp.com/OA_HTML/jtflogin.jsp and search “RVP”. Ancillary
reagents should be used only according to the instructions for use contained in the RVP
package insert. Any assay problems or failures that are suspected to involve ancillary
reagents should be reported to Luminex Molecular Diagnostics Inc. The following is a list of

Interpretation of Influenza A Results
See k063765
Reporting Influenza A Results
• Report negative test results for Influenza A as “Matrix gene target not detected, and
hemagglutinin gene targets not detected. It is recommended that specimens found to be
negative after examination using a respiratory viral panel nucleic acid detection assay be
confirmed by cell culture. Negative results do not preclude respiratory virus infection and
should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other management
decisions.”
• Report positive test results as “Influenza A positive, and (where applicable) hemagglutinin
gene target (specify hemagglutinin target detected, e.g. H1, or H3). This result does not
rule out co-infections with pathogens that were not screened for by RVP. A positive result
for a hemagglutinin gene target does not identify a specific influenza A strain (e.g. H1N1).
The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease. Results should be used in
conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings.”
• Positive for type (i.e., influenza A), and negative or equivocal for subtype. In the event that
RVP positively identifies the Flu A matrix gene target but fails to identify a hemagglutinin
gene target (H1 or H3), the sample should be re-tested with RVP from the extraction step
together with external controls for these two analytes. Extract prepared from the sample
should be run in duplicate. In the case where the re-test on both replicates does not yield a
positive type result for H1 or H3 and external controls are properly typed, further follow-
up is required. A positive test result for Influenza A in the presence of a negative test result
for an Influenza subtype (i.e., H1 or H3) necessitates immediate notification of appropriate

local, state or federal public health authorities to determine necessary measures for
verification of results in accordance with the MMWR notice
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5613a4.htm and
http://www.cste.org/ps/2007pdfs/novelfluanndssjan10final23.pdf), to determine whether
the questionable Flu A specimen represents a novel strain of Influenza.
• A “No Call” due to an equivocal or invalid result as shown in Table 13.4.1-1, should not
be reported but re-tested as per recommendations in Table 13.5-1. The re-test result
should be considered the final RVP call for that analyte.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
See k063765
Reproducibility of the assay in the specimens near the clinical cutoff of the assay:
Reproducibility was assessed across 3 sites using replicates of samples containing viral
material from culture-derived isolates in the matrix simulating intended use specimen type.
The panel contained samples prepared to represent low positive (LP) and high negative (HN)
analyte levels relative to the RVP cut-offs. Each simulated sample within the panel was
divided into aliquots, blinded and stored frozen (-70°C) prior to testing. Thus, aliquots of the
same blinded panel of samples were tested at the three different sites. Each site used a
different extraction method (Site 1 used Biomérieux EasyMag™, Site 2 used Qiagen
QIAamp® MiniElute®, and Site 3 used Biomérieux MiniMag™). For each of the 3 extraction
methods evaluated, 2 aliquots of a given sample dilution were extracted per day, for each of 3
days (i.e. a total of six extractions per site). At each site, both extracts from a given day were
assayed in singlicate on the same RVP run. Calls (Positive, Equivocal, Negative) generated
for the viral analyte in question are summarized in Tables below.
