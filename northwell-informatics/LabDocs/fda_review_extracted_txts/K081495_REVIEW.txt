Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Premarket Notifications for
Automated Differential Cell Counters for Immature or Abnormal Blood Cells; Final
Guidance for Industry and FDA
L. Test Principle:
CBC analysis is based on the electrical impedance counting and absorption
spectrophotometry. Electrical impedance is used to count and size WBCs, RBCs, and
PLTs. This method counts and sizes cells by detecting and measuring changes in
electrical resistance when a cell suspended in a conductive liquid passes through a
small aperture. The system counts the individual cells and provides cell size
distribution. Hemoglobin is measured using a methemoglobin chromagen formed
using the cyanide-free lytic reagent. The methemoglobin is measured
photometrically at 555 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
• Short-term imprecision: The study was performed at the internal site at
least 4 times on 3 CD-Emerald instruments, and 1 CD-Emerald instrument
at each of the 3 external sites with normal fresh blood. Each imprecision
data set was based on 31 runs of the same specimen.

• Long-term imprecision: Tri-level CELL-DYN 16 Control (2 lots) were
tested in duplicate on 6 CD-Emerald instruments for the duration of the
study. Statistical analysis, as defined in CLSI EP5-A2 and EP-15-A2 was
used to estimate the repeatability and within-device imprecision by
standard deviation and %CV of measurands listed on the commercial
control package insert.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range/analytical measuring range: Simple
manipulations (concentration/dilution) of fresh whole blood from normal
donors were done to generate certain low and high analytical range for
correlation samples. The unmodified specimen results were taken as truth,
and the dilution ratios provided calculated expected values. The means of the
dilution replicates were plotted against the calculated expected results. In

addition, commercially available linearity kits from R&D Systems was
assayed and analyzed. The correlation coefficient (r) values of >0.975 for
WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT were obtained in the study.
c. Carryover: Carryover was performed on 3 CD-Emerald instruments, at least
three times per instruments for WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT measurands.
Fresh whole blood samples with High Target Values (HTV) were tested in
triplicates; followed by 3 aspirations of whole blood Low Target Value (LTV)
samples. Carryover (%) was calculated using the following equation:
Carryover (%) = (LTV1-LTV3)/(HTV3-LTV3) x 100
% Carryover (95% CI) was obtained for the following parameters:
Measurands Low Target High Target % Carryover (95%
(Units) Value Value Confidence Limit)
WBC (K/µL) >0 and <3 >90 <1%
RBC (M/µL) >0 and <1.5 >6.20 <1%
HGB (g/dL) >0 and <5.0 >22.0 <1%
PLT (K/µL) >0 and <100 >900 <2.2%
d. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
N/A
e. Detection limit: N/A
f. Analytical specificity: N/A
g. Assay cut-off: N/A
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device: Clinical samples were analyzed
on the test instruments and compared against predicate devices for both CBC
and differentials. Correlation was also determined by comparing the
differential results obtained by the CD-Emerald to those by manual
microscopy. The CD-Emerald’s WBC Overall Flagging ability was evaluated
by comparing their results against the predicate’s results.
• Correlation to CD-1800:
The internal Abbott site obtained the following results on 330 blood
samples.
