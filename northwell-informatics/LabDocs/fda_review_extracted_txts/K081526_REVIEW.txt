I. Device Description:
The FlowCARE™ TLG Reagent consists of a four-color antibody reagent composed
of CD45-FITC, CD4-PE, CD8-ECD, and CD3-PC5. The assay is performed on the
EPICS XL or suitably equipped flow cytometer (see intended use for specifications)
using appropriate quality control reagents in combination with an optional absolute
count reagent, Flow-Count™ Fluorospheres, for determination of CD3+, D3+CD4+,
and CD3+CD8+ absolute counts as a single platform measurement, or in combination
with a White Blood Cell Count from a hematology analyzer as a dual platform
measurement. The reagent is supplied in 0.5 mL vials.

L. Test Principle:
This test depends on the ability of a monoclonal antibody to bind to the surface of
cells expressing discrete antigenic determinants. Specific cell staining is
accomplished by incubating whole blood with the monoclonal antibody reagent. The
FlowCARE TLG Reagent is a combination of four murine monoclonal antibodies,
each conjugated to a specific fluorochrome and specific for different cell surface
antigens.
Red blood cells are lysed with the COULTER IMMUNOPREP™ Reagent System
and COULTER TQ-Prep™ Workstation or equivalent. The remaining white blood
cells are analyzed by flow cytometry using a sequential gating strategy. The total
WBC gate is defined in the first histogram (log SS vs. CD45-FITC) by the inclusion
of all CD45+ events with low, medium and high Side Scatter. A second histogram
(CD3-PC5 vs. CD4-PE), gated on the lymphocytes defined in the first histogram,
identifies CD3+CD4+ lymphocytes by setting a region to include dual positive
events. A third histogram (CD3-PC5 vs. CD8-ECD), gated on the lymphocytes
defined in the first histogram, identifies CD3+CD8+ lymphocytes by setting a region
to include dual positive events. The CD3+ percent is obtained from either histogram 2

or 3. The CD3+, CD3+CD4+ and D3+CD8+ absolute count are calculated using
Flow-Count Fluorospheres. Alternatively, the absolute counts may be calculated
using the %lymphocytes obtained from the fourth histogram (log SS vs. CD45-FITC)
gated on the total WBC. The total WBC count from the hematology analyzer is
multiplied by the %lymphocytes and the % CD3+, D3+CD4+ or %CD3+CD8+.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-Run Variability
The percent positive and absolute count values were determined using
IMMUNO-TROL and IMMUNO-TROL Low Cells, run in duplicate, twice
each day for up to 20 days at 3 geographically diverse sites using FlowCARE
TLG Reagent. Measurements (% positive and absolute counts) for CD3+,
CD3+CD4+, and CD3+CD8+ populations were within assay values as
determined in the control package insert. See result below:
