H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Light Diagnostics™ HSV 1/2 Typing DFA Kit is an in vitro diagnostic test
for the qualitative detection and identification of herpes simplex virus type 1
and/or type 2 in direct specimens from patients with vesicular lesions and
symptoms consistent with herpes infection and for culture confirmation by
immunofluorescence. Negative results do not preclude an infection and should
not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other management
decisions. Specimens found negative on direct specimen detection should be
confirmed by culture.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Fluorescence microscope with 100 watt mercury or halogen lamp, appropriate
filter combination for FITC (excitation peak = 490 nm, emission peak = 520 nm),
100x, 200x and 400x magnification (dry objective)
I. Device Description:
HSV1 Typing reagent consists of two fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies
specific for HSV 1 glycoprotein C and ICP35 respectively. HSV 2 Typing Reagent
consists of two fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind HSV 2
polypeptides. In Western blots these appear as two major bands with molecular
weights of between 110-120 kD and between 78-82 kD and are consistent with the
monoclonal antibodies recognizing epitopes within glycoprotein G of HSV 2.

d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection for each reagent was tested with five (ten-fold) dilutions
made from viral seed stocks. Positive results were obtained using HSV-1
reagent on HSV-1 infected cells down to 80 PFU/ml of inoculum. Positive

The analytical specificity of the HSV 1 and HSV 2 Typing Reagents has been
examined on slides prepared from reference strains as well as previously
typed clinical isolates after cell culture at 1x106 - 8x106 cells/mL. The HSV 1

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 454 specimens collected from 3 clinical sites were included in this
study, 258 samples were from the Eastern region of the United States and 196
from the Southeastern region of the US. The specimens include fresh
vesicular fluid from herpetic lesions collected from patients with lesions and
exhibiting symptoms of HSV 1 or HSV 2 infections.
Clinical samples were submitted to each laboratory in viral transport media.
Cells were washed in PBS, dropped onto slides, and fixed in acetone. Slides
were stained with the Light Diagnostics™ HSV 1/2 Typing DFA Kit reagents,
and another HSV typing reagent for reference, and examined using
fluorescence microscopy. All specimens were placed in MRC-5 and/or HNF
standard tubes for cell culture. Slides from positive cultures were stained with
the Light Diagnostics™ HSV 1/2 Typing DFA Kit reagents, and reference
HSV typing reagent and examined using fluorescence microscopy.
Sixteen specimens were excluded from HSV-1 direct specimen analysis and
18 specimens were excluded from HSV-2 direct specimen analysis, because
of insufficient numbers of cells on the direct specimen slides. The results of
the remaining direct specimen slides were compared to the results of culture
isolation.
Culture results were not recorded for three specimens. Analysis was
performed on the remaining specimens.
