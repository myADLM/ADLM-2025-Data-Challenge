medical purposes for use in Ceruloplasmin, Kappa light chains, Lambda light
chains, Transferrin, Alpha 1-Acid Glycoprotein, Alpha 1-Antitrypsin,
Haptoglobin, Immunoglobulin A, Immunoglobulin G and Immunoglobulin M
assays, to establish points of reference that are used in the determination of values
in the measurement of Ceruloplasmin, Kappa light chains, Lambda light chains,
Transferrin, Alpha 1-Acid Glycoprotein, Alpha 1-Antitrypsin, Haptoglobin,
Immunoglobulin A, Immunoglobulin G and Immunoglobulin M in human serum
and plasma.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

immunoturbidimetric methods.
I. Device Description:
The Sentinel Plasmaprotein Cal 3x is a liquid, ready-to-use calibrator prepared from
plasmatic plasmaproteins in human-based serum. It consists of 4 x 1 mL bottles of
aqueous material containing Ceruloplasmin, Kappa light chains, Lambda light chains,
Transferrin, Alpha 1-Acid Glycoprotein, Alpha 1-Antitrypsin, Haptoglobin,
Immunoglobulin A, Immunoglobulin G and Immunoglobulin M in human serum
matrix.
Human source material was tested and found negative for HIV 1 and 2, HBV and
HCV using FDA approved methods.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The calibrator is traceable to CRM 470 (Certified Reference Material)
renamed ERM-DA 470 (European Reference Material).
Stability:
Real time stability studies have been conducted. Protocols and acceptance
criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims
the following:

2-8° C.
Open calibrator has an expiration date of 6 weeks when stored at 2-8° C.
Value Assignment:
The value assigned to each plasmaprotein is specific for each lot and is
determined by calculating the mean of the results obtained in multiple
determinations for multiple instruments.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Not applicable
