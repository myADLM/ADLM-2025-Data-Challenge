1000iC Automated Hematology Analyzer
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed: Mean Cell Volume (MCV)
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Sysmex® XS-1000iC Analyzer is a quantitative, automated hematology
analyzer for in vitro diagnostic use. The instrument analyzes and provides 21
parameters of a blood sample: WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC,
PLT, MPV, RDW-SD, RDW-CV, NEUT%, NEUT#, LYMPH%, LYMPH#,
MONO%, MONO#, EO%, EO#, BASO%, and BASO#.
The system is comprised of an analyzer and a reagent system. The reagent system
consists of diluent, lyse, and stain. The analyzer provides two modes of blood
sampling: whole blood and capillary. The XS-1000iC consists of three principle
units: (1) Main Unit, which processes, and analyzes blood samples, (2) Auto
Loader, which supplies samples to the Main Unit automatically, and (3)
Information Processing Unit, which processes data generated from the Main Unit.
The analyzer provides two options: CBC and CBC with Differential. Graphic
printer and barcode reader are optional.
2. Principles of Operation:
The Sysmex® XS-1000iC Analyzer performs analysis of CBC and 5-part
differential using the following methods:
- WBC and differential: flow cytometry method using a semiconductor laser
- RBC and platelets: RBC detector using the Hydro Dynamic Focusing method
- Hemoglobin: HGB detector based on the Sodium Lauryl Sulfate hemoglobin
detection method
3. Modes of Operation: Manual Mode, Capillary Mode, and Sampler Mode.
4. Specimen Identification: Manual or by barcode reader.

predicate XE-2100DC, most specifically the MCV parameter. The MCV
results are as follows:
Correlation Coefficient Slope Intercept
0.9527 1.024 -0.22
b. Precision/Reproducibility: 5 blood samples were assayed 20 consecutive
times for MCV precision. Manufacturer specification: ≤ 1.5%.
Sample Mean SD CV
1 97.33 0.19 0.2
2 98.38 0.55 0.6
3 63.27 0.35 0.6
4 118.16 0.45 0.4
5 79.28 0.19 0.2
c. Linearity: RBC linearity was evaluated on the XS-1000iC over the range of
0.300 to 7.910 x 106 /µL, using 6 levels of dilution of Range Check Linearity
Kit. Replicate of three was measured at each level. The results were linear
with the slope of 1.000, the intercept of 0.013, and within Allowable
Systematic Error of 0.36 x 106 /µL.
d. Carryover: Carryover was evaluated by assaying a sample with a high cell
count three consecutive times, followed immediately by testing a low count
sample consecutively three times. Zero carryover result was generated for
RBC, HGB, HCT, and PLT.
e. Interfering Substances: N/A
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Stability: To evaluate the stability of the MCV parameter to 48 hours, 29
samples with normal and abnormal MCV were used. Each sample was split
into two aliquots, one was stored at room temperature (18º-26ºC) and the
other was stored at low temperature (4ºC). Each aliquot was analyzed at
baseline (0 hrs), 24 hrs, and 48 hrs. Percent deviation from the baseline was
used to determine the MCV stability. Data indicated that the MCV parameter
was stable up to 48 hours for samples stored at room temperature and 4ºC.
Manufacturer specification: ≤8% deviation.
b. Reference Intervals: To verify the reference interval, 20 samples were
analyzed and compared to the existing reference values, which were
established on the XS-1000. Normal samples from this study fell within these
established reference ranges. The manufacturer recommends that each
