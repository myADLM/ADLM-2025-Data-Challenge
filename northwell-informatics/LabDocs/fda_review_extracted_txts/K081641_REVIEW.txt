also contains a stabilized, platelet-sized component, and fixed erythrocytes to
simulate leukocytes. The WBC, RBC, HGB and PLT concentrations span the
instrument’s reportable range. Results from repeated measurements for each
concentration are compared to the established expected range to assess the
instrument’s calibration and verify the reportable range.
COULTER LIN-X Linearity Control is a multi-level control product
manufactured in vial (3.3ml) configurations (levels 0-11).

CLIA requires that laboratories establish and verify the performance specification,
accuracy, precision and reportable range, of new instrumentation upon installation,
following significant preventive maintenance, unusual trends / shifts in control
recovery or when recommended by the instrument manufacturer. COULTER LIN-X
Linearity controls can be used on calibrated instruments to comply with these
guidelines. The product's WBC, RBC, HGB and PLT concentrations span the
instrument’s reportable range. Results from repeated measurements for each
concentration are compared to the established expected range, to asses the
instrument's calibration and to verity the reportable range.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility and precision is captured within the range determination study
with data generated from two studies: 1) closed vial stability and 2) open vial
stability.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Value assignment: Value assignments for each lot are determined on
validated systems using Beckman Coulter reagents on appropriate
instruments. One hundred ten (110) vials from each lot are taken randomly
throughout the production run. For each values assignment process, two assay
runs are required on the appropriate instrument on separate days. Four to six
sample tubes are analyzed for each assay run. An assay computer system is
used to determine the number of replicates required for each assay run and
analyze the data in real time. Zero biased, equilibration adjusted data and the
raw instrument assay run data is used to determine the final value assignment.
The value assignments are confirmed by analyzing one to two tubes for a total
of 10 aspirations on the appropriate instrument.
Open vial stability: Open vial testing consists of six aspirations from two
vials per level repeated once a month. Multiple lots of the new level of LIN-X
Linearity Control (Level 10) were tested monthly. Two vials were evaluated at
each time point. For samples analyzed on the LH 750, 1:1 dilutions were
prepared at each time point since the Platelet count exceeded the linear range
of the instrument. On the LH 750 Hematology Analyzer, a single run was
performed on Day 1 to initiate the open vial condition followed by six runs on
4

--- Page 5 ---
Day 7 to validate the open vial claim of seven days. On the DxH
800 Cellular Analysis System, six runs were performed on both Day 1 and
Day 7. The mean recovered values were compared to the assay values and
expected ranges for the additional level.
Closed vial stability: Closed vial testing consisted of six aspirations taken
from one vial per level approximately 3 times per month. Multiple lots of the
new level of LIN-X Linearity Control (Level 10) were tested 3 times per
month. For samples analyzed on the LH 750, 1:1 dilutions were prepared at
each time point since the Platelet count exceeded the linear range of the test
instrument. The mean recovered values were compared to the assay values
and expected ranges for the additional level.
Calibration Assessment Study: LIN-X linearity controls and CBC-Line
linearity controls (predicate) were tested on four instruments to demonstrate
that they yield equivalent results for calibration assessment / verification.
LIN-X linearity control results were assess against the assay values and
expected ranges.
