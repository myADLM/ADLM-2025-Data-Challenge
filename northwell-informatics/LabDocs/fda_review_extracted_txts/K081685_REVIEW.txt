H. Intended Use:
The LIAISON® HSV-1 Type Specific IgG assay is a chemiluminescent immunoassay
(CLIA) technology to be used with the LIAISON® Analyzer for the qualitative
determination of type specific IgG antibodies to Herpes simplex virus Type 1 (HSV-1) in
human serum. The assay is indicated for testing sexually active adults or expectant
mothers to aid in the presumptive diagnosis of HSV-1 infection.
The LIAISON® HSV-1 Type Specific IgG assay has not been established for use in the
pediatrics population, for neonatal screening, or for testing immunocompromised or
immunosuppressed patients. The assay is neither FDA cleared nor approved for testing
blood or plasma donors.

Reagent Integral. The reagent integral kit contains magnetic particles, calibrators,
specimen diluent, and conjugate for 100 tests. Controls are required to run the assay and
sold separately. The LIAISON® HSV-1 IgG immunoassay is performed on the
LIAISON® Analyzer (Model 15970) that was cleared on Feb. 8, 2006 (K052499). The
magnetic particles are beads coated with HSV-1 IgG recombinant antigen. During first
incubation, the magnetic particles are incubated with serum to capture IgG antibodies to
HSV-1. During the second incubation, HSV-1 IgG and antigen complex bound to
the magnetic particles are mixed with the detector antibody conjugate. The detector
antibody conjugate is mouse monoclonal to human IgG conjugated to an isoluminol
derivative. The unbound material is removed with a wash cycle after each
incubation. Subsequently, a flash chemiluminescence reaction is induced by adding
the starter reagents. The light signal, and hence the amount of isoluminol-antibody
conjugate, is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU).

2. Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in
Medical Devices, May 11, 2005 (http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/guidance/337.pdf).
L. Test Principle: The method for qualitative determination of specific IgG to HSV-
1 is an indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). HSV-1 gG1 recombinant
antigen is used for coating magnetic particles (solid phase) and a mouse
monoclonal antibody is linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-antibody
conjugate). During the first incubation, HSV-1 antibodies present in calibrators,
samples or controls bind to the solid phase. During the second incubation, the
antibody conjugate reacts with HSV-1 IgG already bound to the solid phase. After
each incubation, the unbound material is removed with a wash cycle. Subsequently,
the starter reagents are added and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is thus
induced. The light signal, and hence the amount of isoluminol-antibody conjugate,
is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is indicative of
HSV-1 IgG present in calibrators, samples or controls.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility: A reproducibility/precision study was conducted at
two external and one internal. Each site used a different lot of the LIAISON® HSV-1
Type Specific IgG for the study. A coded panel comprised of 8 frozen “engineered”
serum samples was prepared by DiaSorin S.p.A. and provided to the sites. The coded
panel samples were prepared by spiking positive samples into negative samples to
achieve high negative, low positive and high positive results.
The coded panel was tested at all three sites, using four replicates per run in two runs per
day with different operators performing each run during five operating days. The mean,
standard deviation, and coefficient of variation (%CV) of the results were computed for
each of the tested specimens for each of the sites and across sites. The Inter/Intra-operator
and Inter/Intra-site reproducibility results are summarized in the following table.

d. Detection limit: This device is for the HSV-1 antibody detection and was not
tested for the limit of detection. There is no standard available for measuring the
HSV antibody units in the serum.
e. Analytical sensitivity:
1. Cross Reactivity: Cross reactivity studies for the HSV-1 Type Specific IgG assay were
designed to evaluate potential interference directed against closely related members of the
Herpes virus family (EBV, CMV, VZV) and other conditions that may mimic an HSV-1
infection. Serological cross-reactivity has been noted in the specimens containing
antibody to Treponema pallidum and Candida albicans. Caution should be used
when interpreting positive results in patients with these antibodies. Possible cross
reactivity with Saccharomyces cerevisae, the recombinant vector for the gG1 antigen, has
not been evaluated

Performance Characteristics
Summary of Clinical Studies
DiaSorin tested 951 samples collected in the Northeastern United States and compared
with the LIAISON® HSV-1 Type Specific IgG assay to an FDA cleared Immunoblot.
The samples were classified as “At risk” samples (n=401) from sexually active adults (at
risk for a Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD)), Expectant Mothers (n=430) and “Low
risk” samples (n=120) from patients seen at the clinic for anything other than an STD.
The studies were conducted at two (2) independent external laboratories.
The sample populations were divided between the sites. Site 1 tested a total of 460
samples (201 At risk, 199 Expectant Mothers and 60 Low risk). Site 2 tested a total of
491 samples (200 At risk, 231 Expectant Mothers and 60 Low risk). Site 3 tested a total
of 951 samples (401 At risk, 430 Expectant Mothers and 120 Low prevalence). Equivocal
samples were repeat tested as per the Instructions for Use. Any repeat equivocal samples
on the predicate device were sent to a Reference Laboratory in the Pacific Northwest for
Western Blot testing.
Sexually Active Adults (401)
Four Hundred one (401) samples were obtained from Sexually Active Adults who were
seen at STD clinics in the Northeastern U.S. were tested with the LIAISON® HSV-1
Type Specific IgG assay and the HSV-1 predicate method Immunoblot.

Agreement with a CDC Panel
A serum panel was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
tested by the LIAISON® HSV-1 Type Specific IgG assay. The panel consisted of 52%
positive and 48% negative samples. The LIAISON® HSV-1 Type Specific IgG assay
demonstrated 100% positive agreement (52/52) and 93.7% negative agreement (45/48)
with the CDC positive results. There were three false positive results obtained with the
Liaison HSV-I Type specific assay.
4. Clinical cut-off: NA
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The prevalence may vary depending upon geographical location, age, gender, type of test
employed, specimen collection and handling procedures as well as clinical history of the
patient. The observed and the hypothetical predictive values for the sexually active
adults, expectant mothers, and low prevalence populations are shown below. The positive
predictive value (PPV) will decrease proportionally to the prevalence of HSV-1 infection
as reflected in the table. The calculations are based on LIAISON® HSV-1 positive and
negative agreements of 96.9% and 91.3%, respectively, in a sexually active adult
population, 98.7% and 93.7%, respectively, in an expectant mothers population, and
96.8% and 100%, respectively, in a low prevalence population.
