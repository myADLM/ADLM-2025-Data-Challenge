H. Intended Use:
The LIAISON® HSV-2 Type Specific IgG assay is a chemiluminescent immunoassay
(CLIA) technology to be used with the LIAISON® Analyzer for the qualitative
determination of type specific IgG antibodies to Herpes simplex virus Type 2 (HSV-2) in
human serum. The assay is indicated for testing sexually active adults or expectant
mothers to aid in the presumptive diagnosis of HSV-2 infection.
The LIAISON® HSV-2 Type Specific IgG assay has not been established for use in the
pediatrics population, for neonatal screening, or for testing immunocompromised or
immunosuppressed patients. The assay is neither FDA cleared nor approved for testing
blood or plasma donors.
Caution: U.S. Federal Law restricts this device to sale by or on the order of a
physician.
3) Special conditions for use statement(s): For Prescription use only

I. Device Description: The LIAISON® HSV-2 type specific IgG assay is an in vitro
diagnostic device consisting of reagents provided within a plastic container/kit called the
Reagent Integral. The reagent integral kit contains magnetic particles, calibrators,
specimen diluent, and conjugate for 100 tests. Controls are required to run the assay and

sold separately. The LIAISON® HSV-2 IgG immunoassay is performed on the
LIAISON® Analyzer (Model 15970) that was cleared previously (K052499). The
magnetic particles are beads coated with HSV-2 IgG2 recombinant antigen. During first
incubation, the magnetic particles are incubated with serum to capture IgG antibodies to
HSV-2. During the second incubation, HSV-2 IgG and antigen complex bound to
the magnetic particles are mixed with the detector antibody conjugate. The detector
antibody conjugate is mouse monoclonal to human IgG conjugated to an isoluminol
derivative. The unbound material is removed with a wash cycle after each
incubation. Subsequently, a flash chemiluminescence reaction is induced by adding
the starter reagents. The light signal, and hence the amount of isoluminol-antibody
conjugate, is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) that is
indicative of IgG anti-HSV-2 present in the samples.

Medical Devices, May 11, 2005. http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/guidance/337.pdf
L. Test Principle: The method for qualitative determination of specific IgG to HSV-
2 is an indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). HSV-2 gG2 recombinant
antigen is used for coating magnetic particles (solid phase) and a mouse
monoclonal antibody is linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-antibody
conjugate). During the first incubation, HSV-2 antibodies present in calibrators,
samples or controls bind to the solid phase. During the second incubation, the
antibody conjugate reacts with HSV-2 IgG already bound to the solid phase. After
each incubation, the unbound material is removed with a wash cycle. Subsequently,
the starter reagents are added and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is thus
induced. The light signal, and hence the amount of isoluminol-antibody conjugate,
is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is indicative of
HSV-2 IgG present in calibrators, samples or controls.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility: A reproducibility/precision study was conducted at
two external and one internal. Each site used a different lot of the LIAISON® HSV-2
Type Specific IgG for the study. A coded panel comprised of 8 “engineered” serum
samples was prepared by DiaSorin S.p.A. and provided to the sites. The coded panel
samples were prepared by spiking positive samples into negative samples to achieve high
negative, low positive and high positive results.
The coded panel was tested at all three sites, using four replicates per run in two runs per
day with different operators performing each run during five operating days. The mean,
standard deviation, and coefficient of variation (%CV) of the results were computed for
each of the tested specimens for each of the sites and across sites. The Inter/Intra-operator
and Inter/Intra-site reproducibility results are summarized in the following table.

Performance Characteristics
Summary of Clinical Studies
DiaSorin tested 951 samples collected in the Northeastern United States and compared
the LIAISON® HSV-2 Type Specific IgG assay to an FDA cleared Immunoblot. The
samples were classified as “At risk” samples (n=401) from sexually active adults (at risk
for a Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD)), Expectant Mothers (n=430) and “Low
Prevalence” samples (n=120) from patients seen at the clinic for anything other than an
STD. The studies were conducted at two (2) independent external laboratories.
The sample populations were divided between the sites. Site 1 tested a total of 460
samples (201 At risk, 199 Expectant Mothers and 60 Low prevalence. Site 2 tested a total
of 491 samples (200 at risk, 231 Expectant Mothers and 60 Low prevalence). Site 3
tested a total of 951 samples (401 At risk, 430 Expectant Mothers and 120 Low
prevalence). Equivocal samples were repeat tested as per the Instructions for use. Any
repeat equivocal samples on the predicate device were sent to a Reference Laboratory in
the Pacific Northwest for Western Blot testing.

A serum panel was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
tested by the LIAISON® HSV-2 Type Specific IgG assay. The panel consisted of 52%
positive and 48% negative samples. The LIAISON® HSV-2 Type Specific IgG assay
demonstrated 100% total agreement with the CDC positive results (52/52) and negative
results (48/48).

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The prevalence may vary depending upon geographical location, age, gender, type of test
employed, specimen collection and handling procedures as well as clinical history of the
patient. The observed and the hypothetical predictive values for the sexually active adults
and expectant mothers populations are shown below. The positive predictive value (PPV)
will decrease proportionally to the prevalence of HSV-2 infection as reflected in the
table. The calculations are based on LIAISON® HSV-2 sensitivity and specificity of
98.1% and 98.0%, respectively, in a sexually active adult population and 94.8% and
97.3%, respectively, in an expectant mothers population and both 100% in a low
