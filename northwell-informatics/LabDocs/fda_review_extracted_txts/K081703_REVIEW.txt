comprised of the MGH-BT1 (w/Bluetooth wireless download capability) or the MGH-1
(w/o Bluetooth) blood glucose meter, control solution and test strips that carry a
biosensor used for the quantitative measurement of the concentration of glucose in
capillary whole blood that can be taken from the fingertip, ventral palm, hand, upper arm,
forearm, calf and/or thigh by diabetic patients or health care professionals. The results
obtained are plasma calibrated to allow for easy comparison to the laboratory method.
Further, results from either meter may be uploaded to a memory device through a
standard RS32 connection, or, with the –BT1 model, wirelessly transmitted to a
Bluetooth capable PC or Cell phone. The Myglucohealth glucose monitoring systems are
not to be used for the diagnosis or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use. Alternate
site testing should be done during steady-state times when glucose is not changing
rapidly.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
• ISO 15197:2003, In Vitro Diagnostic Test Systems – Requirements for Blood Glucose
Monitoring Test Systems for Self Managing Diabetes Mellitus
L. Test Principle:
Glucose measurement is based on electrical potential caused by the reaction of glucose with
the reagents contained on the strip’s electrodes. The glucose in the sample is oxidized by the
enzyme glucose oxidase, and the current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured
and converted to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is
proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-Run
The testing used venous blood in a heparin blood collection tube. Glucose was
added to the blood to prepare 5 different levels of glucose concentration for the
testing. The glucose concentration ranges were: 30-50 mg/dL, 51-110 mg/dL, 111-
150 mg/dL, 151-250 mg/dL, and 251-400 mg/dL. For each testing range, 10 strips

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Heparinized venous whole blood was spiked or glycolyzed to 11 concentrations
between 27 mg/dL and 552 mg/dL (confirmed by YSI) then tested with the
Myglucohealth Glucose Monitoring System and YSI. Each dilution was tested five
times using the Myglucohealth system and in duplicate by YSI. Regression analysis
showed a linear relationship between the Myglucohealth system and the YSI method:
y = 1.005x – 1.852, R = 0.999.
The sponsor claims 20 mg/dL as the lowest detectable limit. This is supported by the
accuracy testing, which had samples at and near 20 mg/dL (see section M.2.a. below).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor provided the traceability and value assignment procedure for control
solutions used in this device. They are prepared at three target concentrations by
gravimetric addition of glucose to an aqueous matrix. The glucose concentration of
the control solutions are verified with the YSI reference method and expected values
are verified for each new manufactured lot of strips.

Shelf life studies show that the unopened test strips have a 26 month life-span and 3
months shelf-life once a vial of strips is opened. Unopened controls have a 26 month
shelf life and are stable for 3 months after first use.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the system is 20 - 600 mg/dL. This range was verified by the
linearity and accuracy studies (section M.1.b. above and M.2.a below).
e. Analytical specificity:
Spiked whole blood samples containing low, mid, and high levels of glucose (60,
110, and 380 mg/dL), with and without interfering substances, were prepared to test
common endogenous and exogenous substances for interference. The highest levels

An altitude study was performed with 9 blood samples ranging from 31 to 534
mg/dL. Testing was performed at altitudes of sea level and 10,000 feet using a
chamber to simulate high altitude conditions. The test results showed that at 9
different levels of glucose at sea level conditions, there is a difference of -2.0 - 3.0
mg/dL and bias of -5.2 - 3.9% with a linear regression of y = 0.9938x + 1.722 R2 =
0.9993 versus a reference method. Results showed that at 9 different levels of
glucose at the simulated 10,000 feet conditions there is a difference of -2.0 - 4.0
mg/dL and bias of -3.0 - 5.9% with a linear regression of y = 1.0365x – 3.8386 R2 =
0.9991 versus a reference method. The results demonstrate no significant interference
due to altitude at 10,000 feet.
Hematocrit interference was evaluated by adjusting the glucose concentrations and
hematocrit levels of venous blood samples from several donors. The venous blood
samples were spiked to 8 glucose concentration levels (30, 70, 120, 180, 250, 370,
480, 550 mg/dL). The hematocrit levels were adjusted to 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60%.
Each sample was assayed 15 times and the maximum percent bias was calculated
compared to the 40% hematocrit samples. The sponsor demonstrated that the bias did
not exceed ±15 mg/dL, with over 90% of data within ± 10 mg/dL, when glucose
concentrations were ≤75 mg/dL, and bias did not exceed ±15%, with over 90% of data
within ± 10 %, when glucose concentrations were >75 mg/dL, within the claimed
hematocrit range of 20% to 60%.

Not Applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To demonstrate the accuracy performance of the Myglucohealth system, a total of
165 samples were tested at a hospital using the finger as a testing site. Only unaltered
capillary blood samples were used for glucose concentrations of 50 mg/dL to
7

--- Page 8 ---
400mg/dL. To obtain additional samples with glucose <50mg/dL, capillary blood
samples were collected with an appropriate anticoagulant and incubated to allow
hydrolysis to occur. To obtain additional samples with glucose >400mg/dL, capillary
blood samples were collected with an appropriate anticoagulant and then
supplemented with glucose. The samples ranged from 20 to 526 mg/dL. Patients
obtained their own samples and measured their glucose using the Myglucohealth
system following reading the instructions. A healthcare professional then obtained a
capillary whole blood sample in a capillary heparin tube from the patient to measure
the blood glucose level with laboratory method. Results are summarized below:
<75 mg/dL
Within ± 5 mg/dL Within ± 10 mg/dL Within ± 15 mg/dL
29/32 (91%) 32/32 (100%) 32/32 (100%)

87/133 (65%) 123/133 (92%) 130/133 (98%) 132/133 (99%)
To demonstrate the accuracy performance of the alternate testing sites (upper arm,
forearm, calf, thigh, ventral palm, dorsal hand) for the Myglucohealth system a total
of 150 patients performed a finger stick and sampled from each alternate site. A
healthcare professional then performed the same testing on each patient. The range of
tested values for these samples was 68-537 mg/dL. The patient’s alternate site testing
(AST) from each site was compared to their fingerstick results. The healthcare
professional’s alternate site testing (AST) from each site on the patient was compared
to the healthcare professional’s testing of the patient’s fingerstick result.
Additionally, the patient’s results were compared to the results on the patient obtained
by the healthcare professional (HP). The results of all these comparisons showed that
ISO 15197 accuracy criteria (95% of the individual glucose results shall fall within
±15 mg/dL of the results of the reference method (fingerstick or HP result) at glucose
concentration <75mg/dL and within 20% at glucose concentration ≥75mg/dL) were
met for all alternate sites.

understand the labeling and to evaluate the Myglucohealth system. The participants
were provided with a kit (Myglucohealth Test Kit System) as labeled and packaged as
it would be for the US market in English (only). Participants performed a fingerstick
and measured their blood glucose on the Myglucohealth System. Following this, a
healthcare professional performed a fingerstick on the patient and used capillary
whole blood to measure the patient’s blood glucose. The healthcare professional also
collected capillary whole blood in a capillary anticoagulant heparin tube. This
capillary whole blood was centrifuged, and then the blood glucose measured using
the laboratory method. The results met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of 95% of
the individual glucose results falling within ±15 mg/dL of the laboratory method’s
result at glucose concentrations of <75mg/dL and within 20% of the laboratory
method’s result at glucose concentrations ≥75mg/dL.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. Capillary whole blood is the only indicated matrix.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not Applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not Applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The sponsor provided a readability study that indicated that the user manual, test strip
labeling, and control solution labeling is at an 8th grade reading level or below.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not Applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor included the following expected values for normal glucose levels in people
without diabetes in their strip labeling:
Fasting 70-110 mg/dL1
Two-hours after meals: less than 140 mg/dL2

N. Instrument Name:
Myglucohealth Glucose Monitoring System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
10

--- Page 11 ---
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ______
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip, ventral
palm, hand, upper arm, forearm, calf, and thigh. Since the whole blood sample is applied
directly to the test strip there are no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
This meter is an auto code meter. A color tag on the back of the test strips provides lot
specific calibration information. No calibration by the user is required.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at three different concentrations can be run with this device. When
a test strip is inserted into the meter, the control mode can be activated. This prevents control
results from being stored in the internal memory. An acceptable range for each control level
is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control
result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
None.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
