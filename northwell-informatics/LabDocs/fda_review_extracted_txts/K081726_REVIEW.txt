None
J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
see above associated devices k062829, k072854 and k073492
The accuracy of PC download feature was investigated in k073492.
There is a 300 test memory capacity in DIACHEX+ INFINITY
Blood Glucose Meter. The PC download feature was validated by
installing the TysonBio Link Health Management System software,
setting meter in PC transfer data mode and connecting to computer
through RS 232 port. The accuracy of transfer data was validated by
comparison to the original data in DICHEX+ INFINITY device.
b. Precision/Reproducibility:
see above associated devices k062829, k072854 and k073492
c. Linearity:

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
125 typical diabetic users ranging in age, education and about equally
divided between males and females were included in the user study.
Participants were first provided with a DIACHEX Basic or DIACHEX
Superb glucose meter (with previously stored test data), cable and both the
meter and software User’s manuals. They were asked to read the user’s
