L. Test Principle:
Dimension® (CKI) Flex® Reagent Cartridge
In a coupled enzyme reaction, the creatine kinase in patient samples catalyzes the
transphosphorylation of phosphate from creatine phosphate to adenosine-diphosphate
(ADP) producing adenosine-triphosphate (ATP). Hexokinase (HK) uses ATP to
phosphorylate glucose. The resulting glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized by glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) with the simultaneous reduction of
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). The rate of formation of
NADPH is directly proportional to the CK activity in the sample and is measured
bichromatically at 340 and 540 nm.
Dimension® (MBI) Flex® Reagent Cartridge
The activity of the CK-MM isoenzyme is inhibited by an antibody specific for the
CK-M subunit. The activity of the B subunit of creatine kinase MB isoenzyme is not
inhibited, and it is on this basis that CK-MB can be measured.

transphosphorylation of creatine phosphate to adenosine-diphosphate (ADP),

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To determine imprecision of the CKI Flex® reagent cartridge, CLSI EP5-A2,
Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices, was
followed. During each day of testing, two separate runs, with two test
samples, for each test material, were analyzed for 20 days on the Dimension
RxL analyzer (n = 80 for each sample).
For the CKI Flex® reagent cartridge, the results are shown in the table below:
Repeatability Within-lab
Material Mean (U/L) SD %CV SD %CV
Serum pool 1 46 0.7 1.4 1.3 2.8
Serum pool 2 166 1.4 0.8 3.5 2.1
Control level 1 108 1.1 1.0 3.5 3.3
Control level 3 788 3.3 3.3 13.4 1.7
To determine imprecision of the MBI Flex® reagent cartridge, CLSI EP5-A2,
Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices, was
followed. During each day of testing, two separate runs, with two test
samples, for each test material, were analyzed for 20 days on the Dimension
RxL analyzer (n = 80 for each sample).
For the MBI Flex® reagent cartridge, the results are shown in the table below:
Repeatability Within-lab
Material Mean (U/L) SD %CV SD %CV
Serum pool 1 26 1.0 3.9 1.3 5.0
Control level 2 15 1.5 9.8 1.7 11.5
Control level 3 92 3.1 3.4 3.4 3.7
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor conducted a linearity study based on CLSI EP6-A Evaluation of
the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement. For both the CKI and MBI assays,
a high pool sample was serially diluted with a low pool sample to cover the
sponsor’s claimed measuring range (7-1000 U/L for CKI and 3-125 U/L for
MBI). Theoretical concentrations were computed for all intermediate pools
based on the initial concentrations of the high and low pools. Five replicate
tests were run on the Dimension RxL analyzer for each level, using a

randomized testing order. Mean concentration was computed for each level.
Recoveries ranged from 99 to 101% for CKI and from 99 to 102% for MBI.
The linear regression equation was y = 0.4 + 1.009x, r = 0.99997 for CKI and
y = - 0.99906 + 1.0137x, r = 0.99992 for MBI.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and value assignment involves preparation of anchor pools and
master pools. The anchor pool is prepared from pooled normal and high
human serum and is assigned by the IFCC Reference Method. Three levels of
CK master pools are manufactured by adding the appropriate volume of CK
stock, with a known concentration into an aqueous human serum albumin
calibrator base. Level 1 of the CK master pool, containing no analyte is
assigned zero U/L. Levels 2 and 3 of the CK master pool are assigned by the
IFCC reference method and verified against the anchor pools using multiple
Dimension instruments and replicates.
Five levels of CKMB master pools are manufactured by adding the
appropriate volume of CKMB stock, with a known concentration, into an
aqueous human serum albumin matrix. Level 1 contains no analyte and is
assigned zero U/L. Levels 2 - 5 of the CK master pool are assigned by the
IFCC reference method and verified against the anchor pools using multiple
Dimension instruments and replicates. The final bottle values for commercial
lots are assigned to levels 2 and 3 of the of Dimension® CKI/MBI Calibrator,
using CKMB IFCC master pools. The final bottle values for each level of
commercial lots are assigned against the master pools using multiple
instruments and reagent lots.
Stability: The shelf life and open stability of the CKI.MBI calibrator have
been demonstrated using real time data. The predetermined acceptance
criteria and protocols were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The
CKI/MBI calibrator has a target shelf life of 12 months when stored at -20ºC.
The calibrator must be thawed at room temperature before use. Once the cap
is removed, the assigned values are stable for 14 days when recapped
immediately and stored at 2-8 ºC.
d. Detection limit:
CLSI/NCCLS EP17-A, Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection
and Limits of Quantitation, was referenced by the sponsor.
The Limit of Blank (LoB) calculation was performed with N=3 replicates per
sample on each of 3 days on the Dimension RxL analyzer. Two reagent lots, 2
instrument systems, 4 blank samples and 4 low analyte serum samples were
tested. This gave 36 measurements for each of 8 samples, 144 each total blank
and low analyte sample measurements. For the Dimension® CKI Flex®
7

--- Page 8 ---
reagent cartridge, the Limit of Blank was estimated to be 5 U/L. For the
Dimension® MBI Flex® reagent cartridge, the Limit of Blank was estimated
to be 1 U/L.
CLSI EP17-A was followed to determine the Limit of Detection, with
proportions of false positives (α) less than 5% and false negatives (β) less than
5%; based on 288 determinations, with 144 blank and 144 low level samples.
LOD is the lowest concentration that can be detected reliably.
The calculation of the Limit of Detection was performed by the following
formula:
LoD = LoB + (cp)x(sd)
CKI: 5 U/L + (1.646) x (1.3) = 7 U/L
MBI: 1 U/L + (1.646) x (1.2) = 3 U/L
e. Analytical specificity:
Testing was performed using the paired difference approach described in the
guideline document, CLSI EP7-A2. Potential interferents were spiked into
aliquots of a fresh sample pool and analyzed as patient samples. Spiked
sample results were compared to control samples prepared without the
potential interferent.
