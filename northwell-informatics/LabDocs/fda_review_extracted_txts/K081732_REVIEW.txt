--- Page 3 ---
INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer Diluent - liquid saline buffer to dilute samples (3 or 6 vials,
5.0 mL per vial)
INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer Calibrator - lyophilized, single analyte, human plasma
based product containing D-dimer preparation (2 vial, 1.0 mL per vial)
Empty Vials - 3 vials per INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer Reagent, INNOVANCE™ D-
Dimer Buffer, INNOVANCE™ D-dimer Supplement and INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer
Diluent
Polystyrene particles covalently coated with a monoclonal antibody (8D3) 2 are
aggregated when mixed with samples containing D-dimer. The D-dimer cross-linkage
region has a stereo symmetrical structure, i.e. the epitope for the monoclonal antibody
occurs twice. Consequently, one antibody suffices in order to trigger an aggregation
reaction, which is then detected turbidimetrically via the increase in turbidity
INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer Controls
Content: 5 vials each level, two levels, 1mL per vial
INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer Controls 1 and 2 are lyophilized, single analyte, human
plasma based products containing D-dimer.

Precision testing was conducted by following CLSI EP5-A2.
Testing was performed over 20 days, two separate runs with two test samples
for each test material.
One operator, one reagent, and one instrument were used.

Between-day-CV [%] 1.2 (SD: 0.003)
Within-device/lab-CV [%] 4.3 (SD: 0.012)
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study covered a range of 0.12 to 4.46 mg/L FEU. Linearity
testing was performed using a citrated plasma sample spiked with D-Dimer,
concentration of 4.46 mg/L FEU that was diluted with INNOVANCE™ D-
Dimer Diluent.
The linear range was determined according to CLSI EP06-A. Based on the
results of this testing and that from the Limit of Blank and Limit of Detection
Study, the measuring range was established.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrator is traceable to an internal reference standard. A new calibration
is required for each new lot of INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer, after major
maintenance or service, as indicated by quality control results, as indicated in
laboratory quality control procedures, when required by government
regulations.
The INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer Controls 1 and 2 are single analyte,
lyophilized, human plasma based products containing D-dimer. The control is
traceable to an in house reference standard. INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer
Controls must be tested at least every eight hours on each testing day and for
each vial of reagent for the respective measurement range to ensure that the
system is functioning correctly.

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) for INNOVANCE™
D-Dimer was determined to be 0.02 mg/L and 0.05 mg/L, respectively.
CLSI EP17-A was followed to establish the Limit of Blank and Limit of
Detection.
Four blank samples, four low analyte citrated plasma samples spiked with D-
dimer (diluted with INNOVANCE D-Dimer Diluent) and two reagent lots
were tested over 4 days.
The Limit of Blank (LoB) for INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer was determined to
be 0.02 mg/L. The Limit of Detection (LoD) L was determined to be 0.05
mg/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Test samples were prepared by spiking the potential interferent into plasma.
D-Dimer concentrations ranged from 0.45 mg/L to 0.55 mg/L, except for
hemoglobin, bilirubin and triglycerides, where D-Dimer concentrations
ranged from 0.28 mg/L to 0.29 mg/L and 2.32 mg/L to 2.43 mg/L.
Interference testing was performed according to CLSI EP7-A2 to determine
the effect of various endogenous and exogenous substances on the
INNOVANCE™ D-Dimer assay. For all exogenous interferents, hemoglobin,
8

--- Page 9 ---
bilirubin and triglycerides the percent bias was determined by testing a control
sample without the interferent and comparing to the value obtained from a test
sample to which the potential interferent had been added.
To evaluate cholesterol, the endogenous concentration of the base pool was
determined and additional cholesterol was spiked to the test concentration.
The percent bias was determined by testing a normal control sample and
comparing the value obtained from the test pool to which the cholesterol had
been added.
To evaluate creatine, albumin, fibrinogen, Immunoglobulin G, urea, uric acid
the endogenous concentration of the base pool and test pool were not
determined. The test concentration was spiked into the test pool without
taking the endogenous concentration into account. The test pool percent bias
was determined by testing a normal control sample and comparing it to the
value obtained from a test sample to which the potential interferent had been
added.
To evaluate interference from rheumatoid factors interference, samples which
had RF concentrations 3640 IU/mL and samples with no detectable RF
concentration were used to prepare samples for the study. Different mixtures,
e.g., 1+1, 1+3, 3+1, of samples with high concentrations of RF were prepared
and the INNOVANCE D-Dimer assay concentrations were determined in
replicates of five. The recovery of the D-dimer value ranged from 92% to
101%.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
2 clinical sites, 318 samples. Passing-Babcock regression yielded a slope of
0.951, intercept of 0.059 mg/L FEU and r of 0.97.
b. Matrix comparaison:
3. Clinical studies: Frozen samples were collected from 902 out-patients
presenting to the emergency room with clinically suspected venous
thromboembolism (VTE). Patients were evaluated using the Wells’ pre-test
probability (PTP) models to estimate the probability of DVT or PE. Patients were
diagnosed as DVT or PE positive by standard objective tests as appropriate.

--- Page 10 ---
Patients initially diagnosed as negative were followed for four months.
Samples were collected from 2 clinical sites, frozen, and tested at 2 additional
sites. Of the 902 patients, 533 were female and 369 were male; all patients were
between the ages of 18 and 95.
