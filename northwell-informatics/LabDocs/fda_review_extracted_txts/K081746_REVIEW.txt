H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc. device, D3 Duet DFA Influenza A/Respiratory Virus
Screening Kit, is intended for the qualitative detection and identification of
influenza A, while screening for influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus,
adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3 viral antigens, in nasal and
nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates or in cell culture. The assay detects viral
antigens by immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), from
patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection.
It is recommended that specimens found to be negative after examination of the
direct specimen result be confirmed by cell culture. Negative results do not
preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for
diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A virus detection and identification
were established when influenza A H3N2 and influenza A H1N1 were the
predominant influenza A strains circulating in the United States. When other
influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary. If
infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities,
specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for
novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to a state or local health department for
testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+
facility is available to receive and culture specimens.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Fluorescence microscope with the correct filter combination for FITC (excitation
peak = 490 nm, emission peak = 520nm) and R-phycoerythrin (R-PE),
magnification 200 to 400X
I. Device Description:
The Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc. device, D3 Duet DFA Influenza A/Respiratory Virus
Screening Kit, uses a blend of viral antigen-specific murine MAbs. MAbs for
influenza A virus are directly labeled with R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) for the rapid
detection and identification of influenza A virus. MAbs for influenza B virus,
respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3
are directly labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), for rapid detection of
these agents.

L. Test Principle:
The test kit uses viral antigen-specific murine monoclonal antibodies that are directly
labeled with either fluorescein or R-phycoerythrin for rapid detection of respiratory
viruses and identification of Influenza A. The cells to be tested, derived from a
clinical specimen or cell culture, are placed onto a glass slide, allowed to air dry, and
fixed in acetone. After addition of the D3 Duet DFA Influenza A/Respiratory Virus
Screening Reagent and incubation at 35° to 37°C the stained cells are washed with
the diluted wash solution, a drop of the supplied Mounting Fluid is added and a
coverslip is placed on the prepared cells. The cells are examined using a fluorescence
microscope. The influenza A virus infected cells will fluoresce golden-yellow, while
cells infected with any of the other six viruses will fluoresce apple-green. Uninfected
cells will contain no fluorescence but will be stained red by the Evans Blue counter-
stain. If only golden-yellow fluorescent cells are present the specimen can be
reported as positive for influenza A antigen. If only apple-green fluorescent cells are
present, the particular virus may be identified using an FDA approved assay such as
the individual reagents from the D3 Ultra™ DFA Respiratory Virus Screening & ID
Kit (D3 Ultra) on new, separate cell preparations. If both golden-yellow and apple-
green are present, the additional virus may be identified using an FDA approved
assay such as the individual reagents from the D3 Ultra on new, separate cell
preparations.
It is recommended that results for specimens found to contain no fluorescent cells
after examination of the direct specimen result be confirmed by cell culture.
Interpretation of results:
It is recommended that controls be examined first to ensure proper test performance
before examination of the specimens. The entire cell spot or monolayer of cells
should be examined before reporting final results. Patient sample results should not
be reported unless controls perform as expected.
Uninfected cells will fluoresce dull red due to the Evans Blue counter-stain included
in the DFA Reagent.
Fluorescent staining pattern of respiratory virus infected cells:
• Influenza A: A positive reaction is one in which golden-yellow fluorescence is
observed in the cytoplasm, nucleus or in both. Cytoplasmic staining is often
punctate with large inclusions while nuclear staining is uniformly bright.
• Other respiratory viruses: Green fluorescence observed in the cytoplasm and/or
nucleus is suggestive of infection with a respiratory virus other than influenza A
virus. The staining patterns described below are for reference only; identification
of the viral antigens present in the apple-green fluorescent cells must be
performed using another FDA cleared device:
a) Influenza B virus: The fluorescence is cytoplasmic, nuclear or both.
Cytoplasmic staining is often punctate with large inclusions while nuclear
staining is uniformly bright.
b) Respiratory syncytial virus: The fluorescence is cytoplasmic and punctate
with small inclusions in the syncytia.
c) Adenovirus: The fluorescence is cytoplasmic and punctate or bright nuclear
or both.
d) Parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3: The fluorescence is cytoplasmic and
5

--- Page 6 ---
punctate with irregular inclusions. Types 2 and 3 cause the formation of
syncytia.
• Co-infection with influenza A virus and other viruses has been reported in a
number of studies. The presence of multiple viruses is indicated when a stained
slide well exhibits both golden-yellow and apple-green fluorescent cells.
Results from direct specimen testing: The quality of the specimen with respect to the
number of epithelial cells in the sample can be assessed by examining the different
fields at a magnification of 200X. A satisfactory specimen should have at least 2
columnar epithelial cells per field. A negative result is indicated by the absence of
fluorescence in a minimal sampling of 20 columnar epithelial cells. An inadequate
sample is indicated by fewer than 20 columnar epithelial cells present in the sample,
in which case the test is considered invalid. A new specimen should be obtained and
tested or cell culture of the remaining specimen should be initiated.
A satisfactory specimen with no fluorescent cells observed should be reported as “No
influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza type
1, parainfluenza type 2, or parainfluenza type 3 viral antigens detected by direct
specimen testing”.
If golden-yellow fluorescent cells are found, it should be reported as “influenza A
viral antigens detected by direct specimen testing.”
If only apple-green fluorescent cells are found, the identification of the virus(es),
other than influenza A may be based on the follow-up assay (e.g. D3 Ultra DFA Kit).
In such cases, identification and reporting of the apple-green fluorescing viral
antigen(s) should be performed according the respective device’s instructions.
If co-infection of influenza A virus and one of the other respiratory viruses is detected
(exhibited by both golden-yellow and apple-green fluorescent cells present) the
identification of the virus(es), other than influenza A, may be based on the follow-up
assay, such as D3 Ultra DFA Kit (not provided). In such cases, it should be reported
as “Influenza A viral and identification and reporting of the apple-green fluorescing
viral antigen(s) should be performed according the respective device’s instructions.
Results from Culture Isolation / Confirmation: The entire cell spot or monolayer of
cells must be examined for virus-infected, fluorescent cells. If no fluorescent cells
are found, the results of testing of the specimen should be reported as, “No Influenza
A, Influenza B, Adenovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Parainfluenza 1,
Parainfluenza 2, or Parainfluenza 3 isolated by cell culture.”
If golden-yellow fluorescent cells are found, it should be reported as “influenza A
virus isolated in cell culture”.
If only apple-green fluorescing cells are found, the identification of the virus(es),
other than influenza A may be based on the follow-up assay (such as D3 Ultra DFA
Kit). In such cases, identification and reporting of the apple-green fluorescing viral
antigen(s) should be performed according the respective device’s instructions.
4. If co-infection of influenza A virus and one of the other respiratory viruses is
detected (exhibited by both golden-yellow and apple-green fluorescent cells present)
the identification of the virus(es), other than influenza A, may be based on the follow-
up assay, such as D3 Ultra DFA Kit (not provided). In such cases, it should be
reported as “Influenza A viral and identification and reporting of the apple-green
6

--- Page 7 ---
fluorescing viral antigen(s) should be performed according the respective device’s
instructions.”
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Assay precision, intra-assay variability and inter assay variability were
assessed with a panel of proficiency-level antigen control slides. The panel
consisted of slides spotted with cell preparations of the following:
1. Low level influenza A (Victoria strain)
2. Mid level influenza A (Victoria strain)
3. Low level influenza A (Victoria strain) mixed with Mid level RSV
(Washington strain)
4. Mid level influenza A (Victoria strain) mixed with Low level RSV
(Washington strain)
5. Low level respiratory virus (either influenza virus B {Taiwan strain},
adenovirus type 1, Parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, or 3 (strains C35, Greer,
C243 respectively). This panel member was rotated during the 5-days of
testing so that each virus is tested twice.
6. Negative – no infected cells present
The low level is estimated to contain between 4 to 10% infected cells per cell
spot. The mid level is estimated to contain between 20 to 25% infected cells
per cell spot. Both levels were below the level used in quality control slides.
Each panel member was re-coded daily to prevent its identification. Each
panel was stained twice per day for 5-days by three different laboratories.
The following results were recorded for both the control slide and the panel
slide:
1. Presence or absence of Yellow-gold fluorescence.
2. Percent of cells exhibiting Yellow-gold fluorescence
3. Presence or absence of Green fluorescence
4. Percent of cells exhibiting Green fluorescence
The combined data for negative specimens – no infected cells present - from
the three sites demonstrates that the R-PE labeled and FITC labeled MAbs
reproducibly do not stain uninfected cells. No fluorescent cells were seen in
100% (60/60) of the wells lacking infected cells.
The combined data from the three sites demonstrates reproducible detection of
influenza A virus by the R-PE labeled MAbs. The presence of influenza A
virus infected cells was reported in 95.3% (143/150) of the wells in which the
infected cells were expected:

Cross-Reactivity Testing
The D3 Duet Influenza A/Respiratory Virus Screening Kit was tested for
cross-reactivity against a variety of cells and microorganisms. Stringent
conditions for cross-reactivity testing were achieved by using a high
concentration of the D3 Duet DFA Influenza A/Respiratory Virus Screening
Reagent and relatively high titers of microorganisms. The D3 Duet DFA
Influenza A/Respiratory Virus Screening Reagent was prepared at 1.5X the
concentration that is provided in the kit. No cross-reactivity was observed for
32 virus strains or for 17 host culture cell types. Twenty-five bacterial strains,
one yeast, three Chlamydia sp. and one protozoan were evaluated for cross-
reactivity, including Staphylococcus aureus, a protein-A-producing bacterium.
Staining of S. aureus appeared as small points of fluorescence.

negative. Reactivity with Staphylococcus aureus is more than likely due to
binding the protein A produced by Staphylococcus aureus. Concentrations for
each bacterial organism cultured by DHI for cross reactivity testing were
determined from suspensions of the bacteria in PBS by spectrophotometer
according to McFarland standards of levels 1.0 and 2.0 (equaling
approximately 3.0 x 106 and 6.0 x 106 CFU per mL). Slides were prepared
with spots of 0.01-mL of the suspensions to give either 3.0 x 104 or 6.0 x 104
per spot. At the same time, 1-mL of each suspension was plated on an
appropriate agar dish for colony confirmation. According to the confirmation
agar cultures, initial concentrations of the bacterial organisms in the study
ranged from 6.4 x 104 to 2.9 x 107 CFU. Microorganisms tested are listed

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Direct fresh specimens:
A study was performed prospectively at three sites with 1203 fresh specimens
that were received for respiratory virus testing. Each specimen was evaluated
by the D3 Duet DFA Influenza A/Respiratory Virus Screening Kit and a
cleared DSFA device for the presence of influenza A, influenza B, respiratory
syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza 1, parainfluenza 2 and
parainfluenza 3 in cells derived from clinical specimens. A total of nineteen
specimens were excluded from analysis due to a site deviations, duplicate
specimen, insufficient cell numbers, or high background. These exclusions
left 1184 specimen results for analysis.
The following tables detail the summary of the comparison of the D3 Duet and
the cleared DSFA comparator assay, combined for study sites 1, 2, and 3:

Cultured specimens:
To evaluate the performance of this device using cultured clinical specimens,
a fourth study was performed with 298 frozen specimens to compare
performance of the D3 Duet DFA Influenza A/Respiratory Virus Screening
Kit with that of the predicate for the presence of Influenza A, Influenza B,
Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Adenovirus, Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza 2
and Parainfluenza 3 (Para 3) from cultured clinical specimens. At Study Site
4, 298 frozen specimens were processed for cell culture testing in accordance
with the procedure in the Comparator product insert (same procedure for both
Subject and Comparator devices) using R-Mix Too™ FreshCells™ in 48/24-

A variety of viral respiratory pathogens were isolated. Virus identification of
D3 Duet FITC Positive Specimens using D3 Ultra Identification Reagents
yielded the following isolates: influenza A virus [prevalence 22.5% (67/298)],
influenza B virus [prevalence 6.7% (20/298)], respiratory syncytial virus
[prevalence 11.1% (33/298)], adenovirus [prevalence 3.4% (10/298)],
parainfluenza type 1 virus [prevalence 1.7% (5/298)], parainfluenza type 2
virus [prevalence 1.0% (3/298)], and parainfluenza type 3 virus [prevalence
3.0% (9/298)].
There were sixteen co-infections as follows: three influenza A virus +
parainfluenza type 3 virus, one influenza A virus + parainfluenza type 1 virus,
one influenza A virus + parainfluenza type 2 virus, two influenza A virus +
respiratory syncytial virus, one influenza A virus + adenovirus, one influenza
B virus + parainfluenza type 2 virus, one influenza B virus + parainfluenza
type 3 virus, one influenza B virus + respiratory syncytial virus, one
respiratory syncytial virus + parainfluenza type 1 virus, two respiratory
syncytial virus + parainfluenza type 3 virus, one adenovirus + parainfluenza
type 1 virus and one adenovirus + parainfluenza type 3 virus.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
A study was performed prospectively at three sites with 1184 fresh specimens that
were received for respiratory virus testing. Each specimen was evaluated for the
presence of influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus,
parainfluenza 1, parainfluenza 2 and parainfluenza 3 in cells derived from clinical
specimens. Prevalence of the respiratory viruses within this population during the
2006/2007 season is noted in the table below:
