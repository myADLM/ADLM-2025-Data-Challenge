L. Test Principle:
Glucose measurement is based on electrical potential caused by the reaction of glucose with
the reagents contained on the strip’s electrodes. The glucose in the sample is oxidized by the
enzyme glucose oxidase, and the current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured
and converted to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is
proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-Run
The testing was conducted using venous blood, collected in a heparin blood
collection tube. Glucose was added to the blood to prepare 6 different levels of
glucose for the testing. The glucose concentration ranges were: 20-50 mg/dL, 51-
110 mg/dL, 111-150 mg/dL, 151-250 mg/dL, 251-400 mg/dL, and 401~600
mg/dL. For each testing range, 10 Meters, 10 test strips for each meter, and 2 lots
of test strips were used. (N=10 Meter x10 tests x 2 lots =200)

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Testing was performed using whole blood supplemented with β-D-glucose to provide
630 samples at blood glucose levels between 14 and 613mg/dL. The range of samples
tested on the meter that gave a numeric result was between 22 and 600mg/dL.
The linear regression was as follows:
N= 630
Slope 1.0263
Y-intercept -1.6952

R 0.9949
The sponsor claims 20 mg/dL as the lowest detectable limit.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor claims that the device is traceable to a laboratory analyzer which is
calibrated to a glucose standard (NIST SRM 965a).
The two control solutions (normal and high levels) consist of buffered aqueous
solutions of β-D-glucose and non-reactive ingredients. Lot-specific ranges are printed
on the test strip bottle label.
Closed Vial Stability of Control Solution: Three lots of each glucose level of control
solution were tested using an accelerated stability study. The results showed that
during the simulated time frame of 19 months at room temperature, the controls were
within the specified ranges (96 mg/dL – 144 mg/dL for normal level and 240 mg/dL –
420 mg/dL for high level).

Opened Vial Stability of Control Solution: The measured glucose levels of 2 lots of
each level of control solution were tested during the use lifetime period (90 days) and
were found to be within the specified ranges (96 mg/dL – 144 mg/dL for normal level
and 240 mg/dL – 420 mg/dL for high level), and the average bias with respect to the
mean value throughout the lifetime is less than ≤20% and a CV of 6%.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the system is 20 - 600 mg/dL. This range was verified by the
linearity study (above section M.1.b.).
e. Analytical specificity:
Spiked whole blood samples containing three levels of glucose (50, 250, and 500
mg/dL), with and without interfering substances, were prepared to test common
endogenous and exogenous substances for interference. Levels tested for each
interferant (in mg/dL) are summarized below:
Interferent (mg/dL) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3
Acetaminophen 2 8 15
Ascorbic acid 2.5 3.0
Dopamine 2 13
Gentisic acid 6 8
Ibuprofen 4.2 40
L-Dopa 2 10
Methyldopa 1 2 2.5
Sodium Salicylate 30 40 50
Tetracycline 0.4
Tolbutamide 10 64 100
Bilirubin – unconjugated 1.2
Cholesterol 500
Creatinine 1.5 30
Triglycerides 190 3000
Uric acid 10 13 14
Galactose 10 20
Maltose 5 10
Xylose 10 20
Interference testing showed that the system results in less than ±10% bias in the
presence of high concentrations of interferants even beyond clinically significant
ranges.
Positive errors greater than 10% were found in the presence of the following and are
presented in the labeling under limitations for healthcare professionals:
• Acetaminophen (15 mg/dL at glucose levels ≤250 mg/dL)
• Ascorbic acid (3 mg/dL at glucose levels of 50 mg/dL)
• Dopamine (13 mg/dL at glucose levels ≥50 mg/dL)

levels of 50 mg/dL)
• Triglycerides (3000 mg/dL at glucose levels of 250 mg/dL)
• Uric acid (14 mg/dL at glucose levels of 50 and 500 mg/dL)
An altitude study was performed with 9 blood samples ranging from 29 to 595 mg/dL
and spiked whole blood samples of 60 and 310 mg/dL. Testing was performed at
altitudes of 160 feet and 10,360 feet. The test data using capillary blood samples
showed that the bias versus YSI at 10,360 feet is the same bias versus YSI as that
observed at 160 feet. These data indicate no additional effect due to altitude up to the
claimed altitude of 10,000 feet.
Hematocrit interference was evaluated by adjusting the glucose concentrations and
hematocrit levels of venous blood samples from several donors. The venous blood
samples were spiked to 4 glucose concentrations (50, 120, 260, and 500 mg/dL. The
hematocrit levels were adjusted to 0%, 20%, 40%, 50%, 60% and 70%. Each sample
was assayed n=10 for each of two strip lots and the maximum percent bias was
calculated compared to the 40% hematocrit samples. The sponsor demonstrated that
the bias did not exceed ±15 mg/dL when glucose concentration is ≤75 mg/dL and bias
did not exceed ±15% when glucose concentration is >75 mg/dL for hematocrit
concentrations within the claimed range of 20% to 60%.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To demonstrate the accuracy performance of the EasyPlus mini R2N Self-Monitoring
Blood Glucose Test System a total of 156 diabetes patients performed a finger stick
and collected blood from the forearm using the EasyPlus mini R2N system at 3 sites.
A healthcare professional then performed the test on the EasyPlus mini R2N and the
YSI 2300 analyzer. The range of tested values for these samples was 74.2-486 mg/dL.
In order to fully cover the measuring range, 9 of the samples were spiked with
glucose or allowed to glycolyze. The total 165 (156+9) samples ranged in
concentration from 32 to 591 mg/dL. Each sampling site met the ISO 15197
requirement of ninety-five percent (95 %) of the individual glucose results falling
within ±15 mg/dL of the results of the manufacturer’s measurement procedure at
glucose concentrations for samples <75 mg/dL and within ± 20 % at glucose
concentrations ≥75 mg/dL. Results are summarized below:

3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm, and
forearm. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no
special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
This meter is a no code meter. A single calibration code has been selected to be the code
for all test strips for the meter which removes the need to manually code the meter.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor has two levels of controls available for this meter with both levels coming
with the kit and also being available through the distributor. When a test strip is inserted
into the meter, a control can be run. An acceptable range for each control level is printed
on the test strip vial label. The user is referred to a troubleshooting section at the end of
the control test instructions of the owner’s manual to identify possible reasons control
results fall outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
None.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
