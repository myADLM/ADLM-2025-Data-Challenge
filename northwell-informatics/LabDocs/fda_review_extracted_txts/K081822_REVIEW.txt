H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
COULTER® 6C Cell Control is a hematology quality control material used to
monitor the performance of COULTER hematology analyzers listed in the
TABLE OF EXPECTED RESULTS in conjunction with specific COULTER
reagents.
The assigned values and expected ranges on the TABLE OF EXPECTED
RESULTS can be used to monitor instrument performance. This product can also
be used to establish your own laboratory mean.
2. Indication(s) for use:
COULTER® 6C Cell Control is a hematology quality control material used to
monitor the performance of COULTER hematology analyzers listed in the
TABLE OF EXPECTED RESULTS in conjunction with specific COULTER
reagents.
The assigned values and expected ranges on the TABLE OF EXPECTED
RESULTS can be used to monitor instrument performance. This product can also
be used to establish your own laboratory mean.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Not applicable.
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use on COULTER® UniCel DxH 800
I. Device Description:
COULTER® 6C Cell Control is a hematology quality control mixture intended to be
used with automated cell counters and differential cell counters. It is prepared from
stabilized human blood so that repeated measurements by an automated cell counter,
or differential cell counter, can be made to monitor instrument daily performance. It
consists of treated, stabilized human erythrocytes, a stabilized platelet sized
component, and fixed erythrocytes that simulate leukocytes and nucleated red blood
cells. Three levels of varying component concentrations (Level 1, Level 2, and Level
3) are supplied.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Value assignment: Value assignments for each lot are determined on
validated systems using Beckman Coulter reagents on appropriate
instruments. One hundred ten (110) vials from each lot are taken randomly
throughout the production run. For each values assignment process, two assay
runs are required on the appropriate instrument on separate days. Four to six
sample tubes are analyzed for each assay run. An assay computer system is
used to determine the number of replicates required for each assay run and
analyze the data in real time. Zero biased, equilibration adjusted data and the
raw instrument assay run data is used to determine the final value assignment.
The value assignments are confirmed by analyzing one to two tubes for a total
6

of 10 aspirations on the appropriate instrument.
6C Cell Control Level 1 does not contain any NRBC analog particles, thus
assigned values are not generated for each lot. Instead, fixed acceptable upper
limits for NRBC% and NRBC# were developed by the bio-statisticians. As
part of product release testing, recovery within these limits is verified for each
lot manufactured.
Open and Closed stability (tested on the UniCel® DxH 800 analyzer): Three
lots of each level were evaluated throughout the product’s shelf life
(conducted at the beginning, middle, and end). The open vial claim for this
product is 18 events within 16 days. The material was tested until at least 18
aspirations per tube (2 tubes) were taken and the open container date reached
at least 16 calendar days. Storage temperature for products tested was 2-8oC.
Closed vial stability is 95 days. To capture instrument variability, the testing
was conducted on one to four instruments. The recovered values were
compared to assay values established at the beginning of the test interval and
the expected ranges to assess the product’s stability.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected ranges were established for each level statistically, based on data
collected on multiple instruments and lots controls using specific Beckman
Coulter reagents. Total variability is calculated for each parameter. The expected
ranges are provided in the Table of Expected Results.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
