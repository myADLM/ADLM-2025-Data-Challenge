serological reagents (83)
H. Intended Use:
1.) Intended use: The BD ProbeTecCT QX Amplified DNA Assay, when tested with the
BD ViperTM System in Extracted Mode, uses Strand Displacement Amplification
technology for the direct, qualitative detection of Chlamydia trachomatis DNA in
clinician-collected female endocervical and male urethral swab specimens, patient-
collected vaginal swab specimens (in a clinical setting), and male and female urine
specimens. The assay is indicated for use with asymptomatic and symptomatic
individuals to aid in the diagnosis of chlamydial urogenital disease.
2.) Indications for use: Same as intended use
3) Special conditions for use statement(s): NA
TM
4) Special instrument requirements: BD Viper System
I. Device Description: The BD ProbeTecCT Qx Amplified DNA Assay is based on the
simultaneous amplification and detection of target DNA using amplification primers and
a fluorescently-labeled detector probe (8, 9). The reagents for SDA are dried in two
separate disposable microwells: the Priming Microwell contains the amplification
primers, fluorescently-labeled detector probe, nucleotides and other reagents necessary

for amplification, while the Amplification Microwell contains the two enzymes (a DNA
polymerase and a restriction endonuclease) that are required for SDA. The BD Viper
System pipettes a portion of the purified DNA solution from each Extraction Tube into a
Priming Microwell to rehydrate the contents. After a brief incubation, the reaction
mixture is transferred to a corresponding, pre-warmed Amplification Microwell which is
sealed to prevent contamination and then incubated in one of the two thermally-
controlled fluorescent readers. The presence or absence of C. trachomatis DNA is
determined by calculating the peak fluorescence (Maximum Relative Fluorescent Units
(MaxRFU)) over the course of the amplification process and by comparing this
measurement to a predetermined threshold value.
In addition to the fluorescent probe used to detect amplified C. trachomatis target DNA, a
second fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotide is incorporated in each reaction. The
Extraction Control (EC) oligonucleotide is labeled with a different dye than that used for
detection of the C. trachomatis-specific target and is used to confirm the validity of the
extraction process. The EC is dried in the Extraction Tubes and is re-hydrated upon
addition of the specimen and extraction reagents. At the end of the extraction process,
the EC fluorescence is monitored by the BD Viper instrument and an automated
algorithm is applied to both the EC and C. trachomatis-specific signals to report
specimen results as positive, negative, or EC failure.

Reproducibility of the BD Viper System using the BD ProbeTecCT Qx Assay was
evaluated at three clinical sites on one BD Viper System per site. A panel of simulated
specimens was tested that comprised CT and GC organisms seeded into swab diluent for
the BD ProbeTecCT Qx Assay. Simulated endocervical and urethral specimens contained
a clean endocervical swab whereas the simulated urine and vaginal swab specimens did
not. Un-inoculated swab diluent for the BD ProbeTecCT Qx Assay was used for the CT
negative samples. Nine replicates of each panel member were tested every day for five
days on each BD Viper System. The data are summarized in the following table.

A second study was conducted internally to characterize the reproducibility of test results
(i.e., proportion positive or negative) at target levels below the analytical Limit of
Detection (LOD) of the BD ProbeTecCT Qx Assay. A panel of simulated specimens was
tested that comprised CT and GC organisms seeded into Qx swab diluent at two different
levels each of which was below the respective analytical LOD for the organisms (1:10,
1:100). These levels were selected to fall within the dynamic range of the analytical
LOD curve of the assay. Fifteen replicates of each panel member were tested every day
for five days across three BD Viper Systems. The data are summarized in the following
table.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: NA
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The
recommended Positive, Negative and Internal Control material were tested a sufficient
number of times with acceptable results on all testing days.
d. Detection limit: The Limits of Detection (LODs) for the CT QX Assay with C.
trachomatis serovar H in urine and swab specimens when extracted on the BD Viper
System were determined to be < 15 CT elementary bodies (EB) per mL for neat and Qx
UPT urine and < 30 CT EB per mL for expressed vaginal and endocervical swab
specimens. A correlation of EB to Inclusion-forming units (IFU) suggests that the CT QX
assay LODs with serovar H in urine and swab specimens correspond to < 1 IFU per mL
(15). The CT QX Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode was able to detect 16
isolates representing 15 CT serovars (A, B, Ba, C, D, E (2)*, F, G, H, I, J, K, LGV1,
LGV2, and LGV3) with ≥ 95% proportion positive at a concentration of 15 EB per mL in
CT/GC QX Swab Diluent.
* Testing with CT serovar E included the nvCT strain, a new variant with a deletion in
the cryptic plasmid. (21)
e. Analytical specificity:
1. Cross Reactivity: DNA from 141 organisms listed in the following table was extracted
on the BD Viper System and tested with the BD ProbeTec CT Qx Amplified DNA Assay.
All potential cross-reactive species were tested at > 1x108 cells/mL except where noted.
The CT Qx Assay did not cross-react with any of the organisms tested.

f. Assay cut-off: NA
g. Cross Contamination and Carryover
An internal study was conducted to evaluate the risk of producing a false positive result
in either the same run on the BD Viper System in extracted mode (within run cross-
contamination) or in a subsequent run (between run carryover). Testing was conducted
using negative and positive samples on three BD Viper Systems. Negative samples
consisted of CT/GC Qx Swab Diluent. Positive samples consisted of a representative
analyte (at 105 CT EB/mL) spiked into CT/GC Qx Swab Diluent. The overall rate of
cross-contamination (i.e., with alternating columns of positive and negative samples and
a prevalence of 50%) was 0.41% (9/2208). The overall rate of carryover contamination
(i.e., carryover between successive runs when the prevalence was 50% in the previous
run) was 0.36% (8/2208). Cross-contamination and carryover rates across the three BD
Viper Systems are summarized in table.

urine specimens were collected from 1059 female subjects and 479 male subjects
attending OB/GYN, sexually transmitted disease (STD) and family planning clinics at
seven geographically diverse clinical sites in North America. Subjects were classified as
symptomatic if they reported symptoms such as dysuria, urethral discharge, coital
pain/difficulty/bleeding, testicular or scrotum pain/swelling, abnormal vaginal discharge,
or pelvic/uterine/adnexal pain. Subjects were classified as asymptomatic if they did not
report symptoms. Sixty five female subjects and 7 male subjects were excluded from the
data analysis due to age requirement violations, antibiotic treatment in the last 21 days,
opting to withdraw from the study after initially consenting, failure to obtain paired swab
and urine specimens, urine quantity less than 20 mL, or transport and storage errors
related to specimen collection. Therefore, the final data analysis included 994 compliant
female subjects and 472 compliant male subjects.
Five specimens were collected from each of the 994 eligible female subjects. A urine
specimen was collected and split into Qx UPT, neat urine and the two reference urine
specimen collection devices followed by a vaginal swab specimen and three randomized
endocervical swab specimens. Up to four specimens were collected from each of the 472
eligible male subjects. Up to three randomized urethral swab specimens were collected
followed by a urine specimen that was split into Qx UPT, neat urine and the two reference
urine specimen collection devices. BD ProbeTec CT Qx assay results were generated
from the Qx UPT and neat urine specimens, the vaginal swab specimen, one endocervical
swab specimen and one male urethral swab specimen. The remaining two endocervical
swab specimens, up to two male urethral swab specimens, and the two reference urine
specimens for each male and female subject were tested using two reference methods:
the BD ProbeTec ET CT/AC assay and another commercially available NAAT (Nucleic
Acid Amplification Test). Specimen testing was conducted either at the site of specimen
collection or at a designated BD Viper testing site.
All performance calculations were based on the total number of BD ProbeTec CT Qx
assays results for endocervical, vaginal and male urethral swab specimens, and male and
female Qx UPT and neat urine specimens compared to a patient infected status (PIS)
algorithm for each gender. In the algorithm, the designation of a subject as being
infected with CT or not was based on endocervical swab and urine specimen results from
the commercially available BD ProbeTec ET CT/AC assay and another commercially
available NAAT. Subjects were considered infected with CT if two of the four
endocervical swab and urine specimens (or two of the three or four urethral swab and
urine specimens) tested positive in the BD ProbeTec ET CT/AC assay and the other
reference NAAT (one specimen testing positive in each NAAT). Subjects were
considered non-infected if less than two reference NAAT results were positive. A total of
5388 BD ProbeTec CT Qx assay results was used to calculate sensitivity and specificity.
Sensitivity and specificity by specimen type and symptomatic status are presented in the
table below.
Performance of the assay with endocervical swabs, patient collected vaginal swab
specimens (in a clinical setting), female UPT and neat urine was assessed in the clinical
study. Separate performance was calculated for specimens collected from pregnant
females. Sensitivity compared to patient infected status for FS was 62.5% (5/8): the test
and reference NAAT swab specimens were negative; the test and reference NAAT urine
9

specimens were positive yielding a PIS positive result. FV sensitivity was 75% (6/8): the
test and reference NAAT swab specimens were negative; the test and reference NAAT
urine specimens were positive yielding a PIS positive result. FNU and FUPT sensitivity
were 100% (8/8). Specificity was 94.7% (18/19) for FS, FV, FNU, and FUPT separately.
Tables below summarize the results from symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects
designated as infected or non-infected with CT according to the PIS algorithm.

Note: For female subjects, infections localized to the endocervix or urethra have been reported in the literature (16-
20). Analyses were performed on the endocervical swab specimens and female UPT and neat urine specimens to
further characterize the ten negative female endocervical swabs (105/115) and the eight negative female UPT and neat
urine specimens (107/115).
• Of the 115 female subjects defined as positive by the PIS algorithm, ten had infections localized to the urethra
as indicated by the urine reference result (i.e, BD ProbeTec ET CT/AC assay and other NAAT endocervical
swab specimens were negative, BD ProbeTec ET CT/AC assay and other NAAT urine specimens were
positive). The BD ProbeTec CT Qx assay was negative for nine of the ten endocervical swab specimens from
these subjects.
o Of the 115 female subjects defined as positive by the PIS algorithm, three had infections localized to the
endocervix as indicated by the endocervical reference result (i.e, BD ProbeTec ET CT/AC assay and other

Neat and Qx UPT Urine Stability
Pools of CT negative male and female urine specimens were used in analytical
experiments to support the urine storage and transport stability claims.
For neat urine, pools were co-spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain ATCC 19424 at
45 EB per mL and 150 cells per mL, respectively. Neat urine specimens were stored at
either 2-8oC for 1, 3 or 7 days; or at 30oC for 8, 24 or 30 h; or at -20oC for 60 days. At
each time point, samples were removed from storage and tested with the BD ProbeTecCT
Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode. Thirty-two assay replicates were
generated for each condition (sample type/temperature/duration). The expected results
were obtained with the CT Qx assay under all conditions tested.
For Qx UPT urine, pooled specimens were co-spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain
ATCC 19424 at 45 EB per mL and 150 cells per mL, respectively. The spiked urine
specimen pools were then stored at either 2-8oC for 24 h or 30oC for 8 h prior to transfer
into Qx UPT tubes. The Qx UPT specimen pools were then stored either at 2-8oC for 14,
21 or 30 days; or at 30oC for 14, 21 or 30 days; or at -20oC for 60 days. At each time
point Qx UPT specimens were removed from storage and tested with the BD ProbeTecCT
Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode. Thirty-two assay replicates were
generated for each condition (sample type/temperature/duration). The expected results
were obtained with the CT Qx assay under all conditions tested.
Vaginal Dry and Expressed Swab Stability
Pools of CT negative vaginal swab matrix were used in analytical experiments to support
the storage and transport stability claims for dry vaginal swab specimens. Pools were co-
spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain ATCC 19424 to achieve 90 EB per mL and 300
cells per mL, respectively, when seeded onto swabs and expressed in CT/GC Qx Swab

Diluent. Seeded dry swabs were stored at 2-8oC for 3, 7, or 14 days; or at 30oC for 3, 7
or 14 days; or at -20oC for 30 or 60 days. At each time point, dry swabs were removed
from storage and expressed into 2 mL of CT/GC Qx Swab Diluent and evaluated with the
BD ProbeTec CT Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode. Thirty-two assay
replicates were generated for each condition (sample type/temperature/duration). The
expected results were obtained with the CT Qx assay under all conditions tested.
Pools of CT negative vaginal swab matrix were used in analytical experiments to support
the storage and transport stability claims for expressed vaginal swab specimens. Pools
were spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain ATCC 19424 to achieve 90 EB per mL and
300 cells per mL, respectively. The spiked swab matrix was stored at 2-8oC for 7, 14 or
30 days; or at 30oC for 7, 14 or 30 days; or at -20oC for 30 or 60 days. At each time

Endocervical and Urethral Swab Specimen Stability
Pools of CT negative endocervical swab matrix were used in analytical experiments to
support the storage and transport stability claims for endocervical and urethral swab
specimens. Pools of swab matrix were spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain ATCC
19424 at 90 EB per mL and 300 cells per mL, respectively. The pools were dispensed in
2 mL volumes into BD sample tubes to simulate “wet” endocervical specimens and
stored at either 2-8oC for 7, 14 or 30 days; or at 30oC for 7, 14 or 30 days; or at -20oC for
30 or 60 days. At each time point, samples were removed from storage and tested with
the BD ProbeTec CT Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode. Thirty-two
assay replicates were generated for each condition (sample type/temperature/duration).
The expected results were obtained with the CT Qx assay under all conditions tested.
Post Pre-warm Specimen Stability
Pools of male and female CT negative neat urine were used in analytical experiments to
support the storage stability claims for pre-warmed neat and Qx UPT urine specimens.
Pooled specimens were spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain ATCC 19424 at 45 EB
per mL and 150 cells per mL, respectively and either added to Qx UPT tubes or left
untreated as neat urine. Both specimen types were pre-warmed at 114°C for 15 min, and
cooled for 15 min. After the pre-warm process, specimen tubes were stored at either 2-
8oC for 1, 3 or 7 days; or at 30oC for 1, 3 or 7 days; or at -20oC for 30 days. At each time
point samples were removed from storage and tested with the BD ProbeTecCT Qx Assay
on the BD Viper System in extracted mode. Thirty-two assay replicates were generated
for each condition (sample type/temperature/duration). The expected results were
obtained with the CT Qx assay under all conditions tested.
Pools of CT negative vaginal and endocervical swab specimen matrices in CT/GC Qx
Swab Diluent were used in analytical experiments to support the storage stability claims
for pre-warmed expressed vaginal, endocervical, and male urethral swab specimens. For
both types of matrix, pooled specimens were spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain
ATCC 19424 at 90 EB per mL and 300 cells per mL, respectively and aliquotted into 2
mL volumes in BD specimen tubes. The tubes were pre-warmed at 114°C for 15 min and
17

cooled for 15 min. After the pre-warm process, the specimen tubes were stored either at
2-8oC for 3 or 7 days; or at 30oC for 3 or 7 days; or at -20oC for 30 days. At each time
point, samples were removed from storage and tested with the BD ProbeTecCT Qx Assay
on the BD Viper System in extracted mode. Thirty-two assay replicates were generated
for each condition (sample type/temperature/duration). The expected results were
obtained with the CT Qx assay under all conditions tested.
4. MaxRFU Frequency Distribution:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
A. Prevalence: The prevalence of positive C. trachomatis specimens in patient
populations depends upon: clinic type, age, risk factors, gender, and test method. The
prevalence observed with the CT Qx Assay during a multi-center clinical trial ranged
from 8.5% to 18.3% for female specimens and 0% to 24.1% for male specimens.
B. Positive and Negative Predictive Value: Hypothetical positive and negative predictive
values (PPV & NPV) for the CT Qx Assay are shown in Table 5. These calculations are
based on hypothetical prevalence and overall sensitivity and specificity (compared to the
patient infected status) of 94.5% and 98.9%, respectively. In addition, PPV and NPV
based on actual prevalence, sensitivity and specificity are shown in Tables 8 and 9. PPV
was calculated using: (Sensitivity * Prevalence) / (Sensitivity*Prevalence + (1 -
Specificity) * (1 - Prevalence)). NPV was calculated using: (Specificity * (1 -
Prevalence)/ (1-Sensitivity) * Prevalence + Specificity * (1-Prevalence)).

(1) Chemical lysis of organisms in clinical specimens,
(2) Chemical extraction and purification of DNA using paramagnetic particles facilitated
by employment of an extractor block containing a movable magnet assembly;
(3) Elution of extracted DNA into SDA-compatible buffer; and
(4) Transfer of the eluate from the extraction tube to the assay priming microwells.
Beyond these additions to the existing BD Viper System’s workflow, the following
processing functions are common to both systems (extracted and non-extracted):
(5) Priming microwell heat spike;
(6) Transfer of sample from priming microwells to prewarmed amplification microwells
located directly on the reader stage/heater;
(7) Amplification microwell plate sealing and movement of the sealed amplification
microwells into the fluorescent reader;
(8) Amplification temperature control and fluorescent photodetection; and
(9) Calculation and result interpretation.
