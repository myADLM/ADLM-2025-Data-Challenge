I. Device Description: The BD ProbeTec GC Q Amplified DNA Assay is based on the
simultaneous amplification and detection of target DNA using amplification primers and a
fluorescently-labeled detector probe. The reagents for SDA are dried in two separate
disposable microwells: the Priming Microwell contains the amplification primers,
fluorescently-labeled detector probe, nucleotides and other reagents necessary for
amplification, while the Amplification Microwell contains the two enzymes (a DNA
polymerase and a restriction endonuclease) that are required for SDA. The BD ViperSystem
pipettes a portion of the purified DNA solution from each Extraction Tube into a Priming
Microwell to rehydrate the contents. After a brief incubation, the reaction mixture is
transferred to a corresponding, pre-warmed Amplification Microwell which is sealed to
prevent contamination and then incubated in one of the two thermally-controlled fluorescent
readers. The presence or absence of N. gonorrhoeae DNA is determined by calculating the
peak fluorescence (Maximum Relative Fluorescent Units (MaxRFU)) over the course of the
amplification process and by comparing this measurement to a predetermined threshold
value.
In addition to the fluorescent probe used to detect amplified N. gonorrhoeae target DNA, a
second labeled oligonucleotide is incorporated in each reaction. The Extraction Control (EC)
oligonucleotide is labeled with a different dye than that used for detection of the N.
gonorrhoeae -specific target and is used to confirm the validity of the extraction process. The
EC is dried in the Extraction Tubes and is rehydrated upon addition of the specimen and
extraction reagents. At the end of the extraction process, the EC fluorescence is monitored by
the BD Viper System and an automated algorithm is applied to both the EC and N.
gonorrhoeae -specific signals to report results as positive, negative, or EC failure.

collection and transport devices, applicable reagents, the BD Viper System and BD Fox
Extraction. Specimens are collected and transported in their respective transport devices
which preserve the integrity of the N. gonorrhoeae DNA over the specified ranges of
temperature and time.
Urine and swab specimens undergo a pre-warm step in the BD Viper Lysing Heater to
dissolve mucus and homogenize the specimen. After cooling, the specimens are loaded
onto the BD Viper System which then performs all the steps involved in extraction and
amplification of target DNA, without further user intervention. The specimen is
transferred to an Extraction Tube that contains ferric oxide particles in a dissolvable film
and dried Extraction Control. A high pH is used to lyse the bacterial cells and liberate
their DNA into solution. Acid is then added to lower the pH and induce a positive charge
on the ferric oxide, which in turn binds the negatively charged DNA. The particles and
bound DNA are then pulled to the sides of the Extraction Tube by magnets and the
treated specimen is aspirated to waste. The particles are washed and a high pH Elution
Buffer is added to recover the purified DNA. Finally, a Neutralization Buffer is used to
bring the pH of the extracted solution to the optimum for amplification of the target.
The BD ProbeTec GC Qx Amplified DNA Assay is based on the simultaneous
amplification and detection of target DNA using amplification primers and a
fluorescently-labeled detector probe. The reagents for SDA are dried in two separate
disposable microwells: the Priming Microwell contains the amplification primers,
fluorescently-labeled detector probe, nucleotides and other reagents necessary for
amplification, while the Amplification Microwell contains the two enzymes (a DNA
polymerase and a restriction endonuclease) that are required for SDA. The BD Viper
System pipettes a portion of the purified DNA solution from each Extraction Tube into a
Priming Microwell to rehydrate the contents. After a brief incubation, the reaction
mixture is transferred to a corresponding, pre-warmed Amplification Microwell which is
sealed to prevent contamination and then incubated in one of the two thermally-
controlled fluorescent readers. The presence or absence of N. gonorrhoeae DNA is
determined by calculating the peak fluorescence (Maximum Relative Fluorescent Units
(MaxRFU)) over the course of the amplification process and by comparing this
measurement to a predetermined threshold value.
In addition to the fluorescent probe used to detect amplified N. gonorrhoeae target DNA,
a second fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotide is incorporated in each reaction. The
Extraction Control (EC) oligonucleotide is labeled with a different dye than that used for
detection of the N. gonorrhoeae-specific target and is used to confirm the validity of the
extraction process. The EC is dried in the Extraction Tubes and is re-hydrated upon
addition of the specimen and extraction reagents. At the end of the extraction process, the

positive, negative, or EC failure.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility of the BD Viper System using the BD ProbeTec GC Qx Assay was
evaluated at three clinical sites on one BD Viper System per site. A panel of simulated
specimens was tested that comprised CT and GC organisms seeded into swab diluent for
the BD ProbeTec GC Qx Assay. Un-inoculated swab diluent for the BD ProbeTec GC Qx
Assay was used for the GC negative samples. Nine replicates of each panel member were
tested every day for five days on each BD Viper System. The data are summarized in the
following table.

A second study was conducted internally to characterize the reproducibility of test results
(i.e., proportion positive or negative) at target levels below the analytical Limit of
Detection (LoD) of the BD ProbeTec GC Qx Assay. A panel of simulated specimens was
tested that comprised GC and CT organisms seeded into Qx swab diluent at two different
levels each of which was below the respective analytical LoD for the organisms (1:10,
1:100). These levels were selected to fall within the dynamic range of the analytical LOD
curve of the assay. Fifteen replicates of each panel member were tested every day for five
days across three BD Viper Systems. The data are summarized in the table below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The
recommended Positive, Negative and Internal Control material were tested a sufficient
number of times with acceptable results on all testing days.
d. Detection limit: Endocervical swabs and vaginal swabs were used for LoD studies
because these swabs contain higher concentration of protein, mucous, and cellular debris
and are considered “worst case”. Urethral swabs were not tested for LoD studies.
Endocervical swabs pool - Minipool of 72 individual swab specimens in diluent showing
GC negative results was divided into 6 for spiking with strain 19424 at 5 different target
levels and 1 negative target level (unspiked).
Vaginal swabs pool - Minipool of 12 individual swab specimens in diluent showing GC
negative results was divided into 6 for spiking with strain 19424 at 5 different target
levels and 1 negative target level (unspiked).
Urine: Male and female urine specimens screened separately and equal volumes of
negative specimens from male and female were pooled and were divided into 6 for
spiking with strain 19424 at 5 different target levels and 1 negative target level
(unspiked).
The Limits of Detection (LoDs) for the GC Qx Assay with Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain
ATCC 19424 in urine and swab specimens when extracted on the BD Viper System were
determined to be < 50 cells per mL for neat and Qx UPT urine and < 100 GC cells per mL
for expressed vaginal and endocervical swab specimens.
The GC Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode was able to detect 17 GC
strains (ATCC 19424, 27628, 27629, 27630, 27632, 27633, 27631, 21823, 51803, 23051,
31407, 31953, 35201, 31397, 31151, 43785, 51804) with ≥ 95% proportion positive at a

g. Cross Contamination and Carryover
An internal study was conducted to evaluate the risk of producing a false positive result
in either the same run on the BD Viper System in extracted mode (within run cross-
contamination) or in a subsequent run (between run carryover). Testing was conducted
using negative and positive samples on three BD Viper Systems. Negative samples
consisted of CT/GC Qx Swab Diluent. Positive samples consisted of a representative
analyte (105 CT EB/mL) spiked into CT/GC Qx Swab Diluent. The overall rate of cross-
contamination (i.e., with alternating columns of positive and negative samples and a
prevalence of 50%) was 0.41% (9/2208). The overall rate of carryover contamination
(i.e., carryover between successive runs when the prevalence was 50% in the previous
run) was 0.36% (8/2208). Cross-contamination and carryover rates across the three BD
Viper Systems are summarized in the table.

urine specimens were collected from 1059 female subjects and 479 male subjects
attending OB/GYN, sexually transmitted disease (STD) and family planning clinics at
seven geographically diverse clinical sites in North America. Subjects were classified as
symptomatic if they reported symptoms such as dysuria, urethral discharge, coital
pain/difficulty/bleeding, testicular or scrotum pain/swelling, abnormal vaginal discharge,
or pelvic/uterine/adnexal pain. Subjects were classified as asymptomatic if they did not
report symptoms. Sixty five female subjects and 7 male subjects were excluded from the
data analysis due to age requirement violations, antibiotic treatment in the last 21 days,
opting to withdraw from the study after initially consenting, failure to obtain paired swab
and urine specimens, urine quantity less than 20 mL, or transport and storage errors
related to specimen collection. Therefore, the final data analysis included 994 compliant
female subjects and 472 compliant male subjects.
Five specimens were collected from each of the 994 eligible female subjects. A urine
specimen was collected and split into Qx UPT, neat urine and the two reference urine
specimen collection devices followed by a vaginal swab specimen and three randomized
endocervical swab specimens. Up to four specimens were collected from each of the 472
eligible male subjects. Up to three randomized urethral swab specimens were collected
followed by a urine specimen that was split into Qx UPT, neat urine and the two reference
urine specimen collection devices. BD ProbeTec GC Qx assay results were generated
from the Qx UPT and neat urine specimens, the vaginal swab specimen, one endocervical
swab specimen and one male urethral swab specimen. The remaining two endocervical
swab specimens, up to two male urethral swab specimens, and the two reference urine
specimens for each male and female subject were tested using two reference methods: the
BD ProbeTec ET GC/AC assay and another commercially available NAAT (Nucleic
Acid Amplification Test). Specimen testing was conducted either at the site of collection
or at a designated BD Viper testing site.
All performance calculations were based on the total number of BD ProbeTec GC Qx
assays results for endocervical, vaginal and male urethral swab specimens, and male and
female Qx UPT and neat urine specimens compared to a patient infected status (PIS)
algorithm for each gender. In the algorithm, the designation of a subject as being infected
with GC or not was based on endocervical swab and urine specimen results from the
commercially available BD ProbeTec ET GC/AC assay and the other commercially
available NAAT. Subjects were considered infected with GC if two of the four
endocervical swab and urine specimens (or two of the three or four urethral swab and
urine specimens) tested positive in the BD ProbeTec ET GC/AC assay and the other
reference NAAT (one specimen testing positive in each NAAT). Subjects were
considered non-infected if less than two reference NAAT results were positive. A total of
5387 BD ProbeTec GC Qx assay results was used to calculate sensitivity and specificity.
Sensitivity and specificity by specimen type and symptomatic status are presented in the
table below.
Performance of the assay with endocervical swabs, patient collected vaginal swabs
specimens (in a clinical setting), female UPT and neat urine was assessed in the clinical
study. Separate performance was calculated for specimens collected from pregnant
females. Sensitivity compared to patient infected status for FS, FV, FNU, and FUPT was
100% (3/3). In each case, specificity was 100% (24/24) for FS, FV, FNU, and FUPT
separately.

4. Clinical cut-off: Clinical cut-off was estimated by evaluating GCQ assay results
obtained from a total of 696 unique subjects for a total of 4878 assay results. This dataset
included both the initial and repeat assay results: specimens were tested and then retested,
and both results were included in the analysis in order to generate a larger data pool for
use in training the algorithm. The optimal cutoff for the GCQ Assay was located between
50 and 250 MaxRFU based on the analysis of this dataset. When evaluating assay
sensitivity and specificity over this range of values across all specimen types, the assay
sensitivity and specificity were relatively constant at approximately 92 and 99%,
respectively. In order to guard against false positive results (protect specificity), the
preliminary cutoff was set at 125 MaxRFU. These preliminary cutoff values were
incorporated into the version of algorithm software that was utilized in the Cutoff Trial
by the BD Viper System operating in extracted mode.

populations depends upon: clinic type, age, risk factors, gender, and test method. The
prevalence observed with the GC Qx Amplified DNA Assay during a multi-center clinical
trial ranged from 1.4% to 19.1% for female specimens and 4.8% to 42.1% for male
specimens.
B. Positive and Negative Predictive Value: Hypothetical positive and negative predictive
values (PPV & NPV) for the GC Qx Assay are shown in the following table. These
calculations are based on hypothetical prevalence and overall sensitivity and specificity
(compared to the patient infected status) of 99.3% and 99.4%, respectively. In addition,
PPV and NPV based on actual prevalence, sensitivity and specificity are shown in the
tables under performance characteristics section (See “GC Qx Assay Performance
Compared to Patient Infected Status (by specimen type and symptomatic status)” and
“GC Qx Assay Performance Compared to Patient Infected Status (by clinical site).”
PPV was calculated using: (Sensitivity * Prevalence) / (Sensitivity*Prevalence + (1 -
Specificity) * (1 - Prevalence)). NPV was calculated using: (Specificity * (1 -
Prevalence)/ (1-Sensitivity) * Prevalence + Specificity * (1-Prevalence)).

N. Instrument:
BD Viper™ System in extracted mode with the addition of the CTQ and GCQ Assays:
The BD Viper System with the capability of automated nucleic acid extraction is the third
generation of the BD Viper robotic platform for amplified DNA analysis. The system
builds upon its predecessors, the BD Viper Instrument (K023955) and the BD Viper
System (K052481).
O. System Descriptions:
Viewing the BD Viper System from the perspective of assay workflow, the level of
automation added to enable automated nucleic acid extraction on the existing BD Viper
System includes the following:
(1) chemical lysis of organisms in clinical specimens,
(2) chemical extraction and purification of DNA using paramagnetic particles facilitated
by employment of an extractor block containing a movable magnet assembly;

(3) elution of extracted DNA into SDA-compatible buffer; and
(4) transfer of the eluate from the extraction tube to the assay priming microwells.
Beyond these additions to the existing BD Viper System’s workflow, the following
processing functions are common to both systems (extracted and non-extracted):
(5) priming microwell heat spike;
(6) transfer of sample from priming microwells to prewarmed amplification microwells
located directly on the reader stage/heater;
(7) amplification microwell plate sealing and movement of the sealed amplification
microwells into the fluorescent reader;
(8) amplification temperature control and fluorescent photodetection; and
(9) calculation and result interpretation.
