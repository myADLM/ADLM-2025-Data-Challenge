L. Test Principle:
Rapid IP1 is a lateral flow immunoassay for the semi-quantitative measurement of allergen
specific IgE antibodies in human whole blood (WB) or plasma. Ten different allergens are
bound to the strips in the Test Windows in separate lines. IgE antibodies present in the
patient sample, specific to any of the allergens in the test, bind to the relevant allergen lines
on the strips. In a single step, a gold labeled anti-IgE conjugate is solubilized, migrates up
the strips and forms a visible red complex with bound IgE antibodies while unbound IgE is
washed away. The conjugate continues to migrate, forming visible red lines in the Control
Windows. The Rapid Reader quantitatively measures the color saturation and converts the
signal into Color Units (CU). The higher the concentration of IgE antibodies in the sample
the stronger the color of the red lines, i.e. higher CU values. CU values are then categorized
semi-quantitatively into Class 1, 2 or 3.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
ImmunoCAP Rapid IP1 is a unitized point-of care test thus no intra- or within assay
run component exists. In the analyses and presentations, the within assay run
component is therefore equalized with the between Assay Device component. All
precision studies were carried out in accordance to CLSI EP5-A2. For studies using
whole blood, total precision was used as the measure of precision. Variation between
device, run, lot, and operator were not determined.
Run-to-Run:
Six sensitized single donors and one pooled plasma sample covering the Class 2 and 3
for all the allergens were tested using 3 devices per sample for 20 occasions and 50
sensitized single venous whole blood donor samples covering Classes 1-3 were tested
using 3 devices per sample for 4 occasions. A minimum of 4 hours occurred between
occasions. For plasma samples, the total variation between Assay Devices, between
occasions was estimated to have a CV of 13% and the variation between Assay
Devices was 12%, and the variation between occasions 4%. The total variation using
venous whole blood from 50 donors assayed in 12 Assay Devices gave a CV of 16%.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Measuring Range:
The semi-quantitative reportable range is subdivided into Class 1, 2 and 3 which
correspond to levels of IgE antibodies spanning the range from Low (0.35 kUA /L) to
Very High (100 kUA/L) as measured by ImmunoCAP Specific IgE (IC Specific IgE).
A Class 1 result corresponds to absent or low levels, a Class 2 result corresponds to
moderate to high levels and a Class 3 result corresponds to very high levels of IgE
antibody when compared to IC Specific IgE. In Rapid IP1, the response value (RU)
for the class borders between Class 1/2 and Class 2/3 have been established through
comparison studies with the IC Specific IgE using samples with known IgE antibody
levels.
Linearity:
Four plasma samples from different sensitized donors for each allergen were diluted
4-8 times with IgE negative plasma and tested using one device per sample. The
allergen specific IgE antibody level was determined with the IC Specific IgE device.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
1. Controls:
The ImmunoCAP Rapid QC1 positive and negative controls contain specific IgE
antibodies to specified allergens with an assigned response value based on the IC
Specific IgE assay values of the candidate raw materials prior to pooling. The
final pool of materials is verified by the Rapid IP1. Specific class values for the
positive QC1 control, allergens e1, m6, and e5 are Class 3, Class 2, and Class 2,
respectively. The response value (RU) for the class borders between Class 1/2
and Class 2/3 have been established through comparison studies with the IC
Specific IgE assay using samples with known IgE antibody levels.
2. Stability:
Two positive plasma pools covering all ten allergens and one negative plasma
pool were tested with six assay devices per sample and are compared with
baseline results. Three lots of Rapid IP1 kit, were placed in reference storage
conditions, +2°C to +8°C, for real time stability testing. The testing was
performed at start of study, reference condition at 0 months, and after 3, 6, 10, and
13 months. The study is planned to continue until test occasion 25 months. For
Lot 1, an initial transport simulation was performed during 1 week. After initial
testing at reference conditions, Lot 1 was stored at +32°C. During this week, Lot
1 was also stored at +2°C to +8°C for 18-24 hours at two occasions and at -20°C
for 2-3 hours at one occasion. After this week, Lot 1 was returned to reference
storage at + 2°C to + 8°C together with Lots 2 and 3.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Blank (LoB) were determined using the
capillary and venous heparinized whole blood samples obtained from the 245 donors
from the Method Comparison study. Plasma was processed from the venous whole
blood and the amount of specific IgE antibodies for each of the 10 allergens included
in the Rapid IP1 was determined. All results with an allergen specific IgE antibody
level lower than 0.1 kU /L, i.e. an undetectable level of allergen specific IgE as
A
determined by the IC Specific IgE, was considered as a blank sample for that
allergen. The samples fulfilling this criterion were selected for this study. For each
sample and allergen, fulfilling the criteria, the Color Units (CU) was recorded. The
LoB and LoD were estimated according to CLSI EP17-A. The overall LoB was
estimated to 0.16 CU and the LoD to 0.22 CU. The specification for the LoD was
within Class I (<0.28 CU). The LoB was calculated according to the following
formula: LoB = μ + 1.645σ and using the 95% percentile: LoB = Pct - α
B B B 100
The LoD study, using only CU values, gave an estimated overall LoD of CU = 0.22.
The Dilution Study (Linearity) gave an estimated level of detection of 0.58kUA/L
with a corresponding CU of 0.20. The results for each allergen individually are
shown below. Column “LoD Mean CU” is based on LoB using mean and standard
deviation, and column “LoD 95% Percentile CU” is based on LoB using the 95%
percentile.

e. Analytical specificity:
Plasma and whole blood samples from sensitized and non-sensitized donors were
spiked with potentially interfering substances and the studies were performed
according CLSI EP-7A2. Samples were distributed in Classes 1, 2 and 3 as measured
by ImmunoCAP Rapid IP1. The assay performance of the ImmunoCAP Rapid IP1
for samples both with and without measurable allergen specific IgE antibodies was
verified for high levels of total IgE (1,000; 3,000; and 10,000 kU/L). No interference
of high levels of total IgE could be observed. The spiking studies regarding
potentially interfering substances showed no interference in samples from sensitized
and non-sensitized donors samples spiked with hemoglobin (5.5 g/L), heparin (150
IE/mL), bilirubin (340 μmol/L) and Chyle (1,800 U/mL).
The antibody used for detection in ImmunoCAP Rapid contains the monoclonal
(mAb) anti-human IgE antibody clone 390. The specificity of this antibody for
human IgE was studied using BIAcore technology. Interactions were studied using
polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse-IgG, covalently linked to the reaction surface, to which

the mAb anti-human IgE antibody clone 390 bound upon injection. Subsequent
injections were done with purified human myeloma immunoglobulin (Ig) of the IgE,
IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, IgM or IgD isotypes. The interactions were studied as
measurement of binding and release in comparison with buffer injections and were
evaluated in the BIAcore program. As positive control human myeloma IgE (ND)
was used and it was injected at the concentrations of 1/1, 1/10, 1/100 and 1/1000 as
compared to the other Ig isotypes. No cross reactivity (< 0.1%) with other human
immunoglobulin classes
Interference of Total IgE:
Three sets of samples were tested. The first consisted of five sensitized and five non-
sensitized single plasma donors, which were each spiked with 1,000 and 3,000 kU/L
of IgE; the second set consisted of five sensitized and one non-sensitized single
plasma donors, which were spiked to 10,000 kU/L of IgE; and the third set consisted
of two sensitized and one non-sensitized single venous whole blood samples, which
were spiked to 1,000 kU/L of IgE. Plasma samples were tested with one device per
sample and three devices per sample were used for the venous whole blood. All
samples were measured in Rapid Reader and the results compared to a non-spiked
(neat) sample. The CU value for each plasma sample and the mean CU value for
each whole blood sample and allergen were scored as Class 1, Class 2 or Class 3.
Results obtained with spiked samples were compared with results obtained with non-
spiked samples. The overall agreement was calculated for each spiking level and
sample matrix. One plasma sample spiked at 3,000 kU/L and three plasma samples
spiked at 10,000 kU/L were discordant when compared to the non-spiked controls.
No discordant calls were observed with either plasma or venous whole blood samples
spiked with 1,000 kU/L IgE.
Interference of Hemoglobin:
Two sensitized and one non-sensitized samples each for plasma and venous whole
blood were spiked with 5.5 g/L hemoglobin and compared to non-spiked samples
using three devices per sample. One discordant sample (Class 3) was miscalled
(Class 2) with the plasma samples and no discordant samples were seen with the
venous whole blood when compared to non-spiked samples. The overall agreement
for plasma samples was 97% and 100% for venous whole blood.
Interference of Heparin
Two sensitized and one non-sensitized samples each for plasma and venous whole
blood were spiked with 150 IE/mL heparin and compared to non-spiked samples
using three devices per sample. No discordant samples were observed for either
plasma or whole blood.
Interference of Bilirubin
Two sensitized and one non-sensitized samples each for plasma and venous whole
blood were spiked with 340 µmol/L bilirubin and compared to non-spiked samples
using three devices per sample. One discordant sample (Class 1) was miscalled
(Class 2) with the plasma samples and no discordant samples were seen with the
venous whole blood when compared to non-spiked samples. The overall agreement
11

--- Page 12 ---
for plasma samples was 97% and 100% for venous whole blood.
Interference of Chyle
Three sensitized and one non-sensitized plasma samples and two sensitized and one
non-sensitized venous whole blood samples were spiked with 1800 U/mL of Chyle
and compared to non-spiked samples using three devices per sample. One discordant
sample (Class 2) was miscalled (Class 3) with the plasma samples and no discordant
samples were seen with the venous whole blood when compared to non-spiked
samples. The overall agreement for plasma samples was 97.5% and 100% for venous
whole blood.
f. Assay cut-off:
Rapid IP1 gives results in one of three classes of IgE antibody levels, while IC
Specific IgE assay reports in one of seven classes. Each of the Rapid IP1 classes,
Class 1: absent or low, Class 2: moderate to high, Class 3: very high, encompasses 2
to 3 IC Specific IgE assay classes. As in the IC Specific IgE assay, higher class
scores denote increasing levels of specific IgE antibody with the same descriptive
terminology for IgE antibody levels. In the IC Specific IgE assay, 0.7 kU /L is used
A
as the border between low and moderate and 17.5 kU /L is used as the border
A
between high and very high. Rapid IP1 is a rapid, POC, semi quantitative assay with
class borders approximated to 1 and 15 kUA/L respectively. In Rapid IP1, the
response value (CU) for the class borders between Class 1 and 2 and Class 2 and 3
have been established through comparison studies with the IC Specific IgE using
samples with known IgE antibody levels. A comparison of the measuring range
between the Rapid IP1 device, the IC Specific IgE assay, and other reporting methods
are depicted in Figure 1, below.

commonly used class scoring and the measuring range for the IC Specific IgE.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The comparison study included 245 donors. Heparinized capillary (lithium) and
venous (sodium) whole blood were collected from all donors. Plasma was processed
from the venous whole blood. All three sample types were used in the Rapid IP1, but
plasma was only was used with the IC Specific IgE assay. A distribution of allergen
levels as determined by the IC Specific IgE assay is depicted in Table 10, below.

When compared using a 3x3 format (Table A), the “exact” positive percent
agreements (PPA) for Class 2 and Class 3 are indicated by the subscript. The 3x3
format was subsequently collapsed into a 2x2 format (Table B) to calculate the final
positive percent (PPA), negative percent (NPA), and overall percent (OA) agreement
calculations and is shown below. The NPA is identical between the 3x3 and the
corresponding 2x2 comparison tables. The 3x3 tables were collapsed into a 2x2 table

For the discrepant results for each sample type and allergen, the number of samples at
or near the class borders were determined and presented as shown in the example
below. A sample falling at or near the border was defined as a sample within a
distance of ± 2 SD from the border. The SD used was for the IC Specific IgE assay
CV = 10% and for the Rapid IP1 CV = 17% in Class 2 and Class 3, and CV = 30%
for samples in Class 1. The figures within the dotted lines are the number of samples
at or near the border. The figures in the middle of the different squares are the
remaining number samples. The 3x3 tables were also compared to a plot of CU for
the Rapid IP1 vs. the quantity of specific IgE as determined by the IC Specific IgE
assay for each of the matrices.

b. Matrix comparison:
The matrix comparison study used blood samples from the Method Comparison study
where lithium heparin capillary whole blood and sodium heparin venous whole blood
samples were collected. Plasma was processed from the venous whole blood as
described above in the “Method comparison to predicate device”. The results for all
allergens and matrices showed an overall agreement within Classes was ≥ 91%.
Capillary and venous whole blood and subsequent processed plasma samples were
compared to results of the IC Specific IgE performed on the matched plasma samples
and the results are shown in Table 14 and Figure 3, below.

ImmunoCAP® Rapid Reader
O. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
ImmunoCAP Rapid Reader (Rapid Reader) is a stand alone instrument to be used with
ImmunoCAP Rapid Assay Device. The user interface consists of a LCD display with a
touch screen and a slot for insertion of the ImmunoCAP Rapid Assay Device.
Assay Device docking system
The slot for the ImmunoCAP Rapid Assay Device has two switches for interaction with
the Assay Device.
• One outer switch, to be able to take an image of the Assay Device ID area when
inserted into the slot.
• One inner switch; to be able to take a series of images of the Test Window area of the
device.
Camera, optics and light source
The color camera has a CCD image sensor with 1024 x 768 pixel resolution, a firewire
interface and I/O pins for external signals. The firewire interface delivers the power
needed by the camera. A mirror is located between the camera lens and the Assay
Device to give a longer optical path and lower optical distortion. Four white color
spectrum LED's are placed behind two optical diffusers making the illumination of the
Assay Device more even.
Computer system, hard disk and power supply
The computer is a mini-PC (Intel) with 1.67GHz Core2Duo processor, RAM (512MByte)
and Hard drive (80GByte). The power supply (65W Input 100-240V ~ 1.6A 50-60 Hz)
delivers power to the mini-PC and peripherals.
Display and Touch screen
The display is a LCD panel with 640 x 480 resolution, a standard VGA resolution
supported by GNU/Linux operating system. A Touch screen is placed on top of the LCD
panel and connected to the mini-PC.
Printer
The printer is a thermo label printer with automatic paper cutter and USB interface.
2. Principles of Operation:
The Reader is part of ImmunoCAP Rapid System, which is a combination of lateral flow
immunoassay reagents and instrument/software for semi-quantitative determination of
antibodies or antigens in human capillary whole blood, heparinized venous whole blood
or heparinized plasma. The ImmunoCAP Rapid Reader quantitatively measures the color
saturation and converts the signal into Color Units (CU). The higher the concentration of
IgE antibodies in the sample the stronger the color of the red lines, i.e. higher CU values.
CU values are then categorized semiquantitatively into Class 1, 2 or 3.

The user performs the Rapid IP1 assay according to the instructions for use and inserts
the Rapid IP1 device into the Rapid Reader as shown on the screen of the Reader. If the
necessary control conditions are met, assay results will be displayed on the screen. Print
the results, by pressing the Print button on the screen. If the Reader does not detect the
blood sample or the assay control lines are missing, the Rapid Reader will not report any
results. The Reader will display the results as Class 1, 2 or 3.
3. Modes of Operation:
Semi-automated
4. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
5. Specimen Identification:
Manual input by user.
6. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Samples should be obtained and handled according to the laboratory’s standard operating
procedures and following the protocol described in the package insert for the Rapid IP1
device.
7. Calibration:
The ImmunoCAP Rapid Reader is calibrated at manufacturing and does not require any
user calibration.
8. Quality Control:
The user is instructed to perform routine quality control at set schedules which includes
cleaning and disinfecting the unit and components. A Reader Check using the Rapid
Reader CD is requested by the Rapid Reader the first time the Reader is used during
Start-up. Regular Checks will be required every 7 days. A valid Reader Check will reset
the 7 day time frame. The operator will be reminded by the Reader at day 5 of the 7 day
time frame. A Check button will then appear on the screen, see Figure below. The
Reader must register a valid Check within the next 2 days. Note: The Reader will not
score any Assay Devices after 7 days have passed, unless a new Check procedure with a
valid result has been registered.
The Reader has several internal controls, which automatically check for proper light and
optical conditions before reading the test results. If any of these checks fails the Reader
will not score Assay Devices. Patient or external control results will not be displayed on
the screen if the Reader fails to detect addition of whole blood sample or the development
of the control lines in the Control Window of the Assay Device. If this occurs, the
Reader flags the assay as invalid and no result will be shown.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
ImmunoCAP Rapid Reader Check Device Stability:
The Rapid Reader CD consists of a plastic housing containing a color card with defined
colored areas. The color cards are purchased from an external manufacturer, Scandinavian
Colour Institute AB, Stockholm, Sweden. The stability of the color cards are warranted by
the Scandinavian Colour Institute AB for a time of 5 years when stored dark in room
19

temperature. The recommended use of Rapid Reader CD is to remove the Check Device
from the foil bag, i.e. stored at reference storage condition, and perform a Reader check once
a week. The Scandinavian Colour Institute AB also report an accelerated light stability study
where color card samples were exposed to light of high illumination dose, approximately 10
times normal office light, at a temperature of +30ºC for 3 months. The conclusion, made by
The Scandinavian Colour Institute AB, is that the color cards are stable under these
conditions for 50 days. The set stability time of 24 months is based on
• The stability of the color cards is of 5 years when stored dark at room temperature.
• The color cards are stable for 50 days when exposed to a dose of 209184 lx per day.
• According to the recommended use, the reader check device will be exposed to light
only for approximately 25 hours (15 minutes at approximately 100 occasions).
ImmunoCAP Rapid Reader Check Device Reproducibility Study:
Three lots of Rapid Reader CDs were measured 52 (lot 1) and 60 (lots 2-3) times each on one
instrument. The total variation between Rapid Reader CDs and between lots was CV 0.68%.
The variation between Rapid Reader CDs was CV 0.63% and the variation between lots CV
0.25%. The specifications set for between the CDs and between lots was CV <0.7% and a
total variation of CD <1%.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
