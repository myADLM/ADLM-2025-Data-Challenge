510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
k081855
B. Purpose for Submission:
New device for US consumer market
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Breath Alcohol
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Quantitative (electrochemical fuel cell sensor)
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Impair Aware Alcohol Level Indication System (IA ALIS) is a self-contained
unit with semiconductor-based gas sensor and disposable straw for breath
sampling, and a 3 digit LCD displays the alcohol level. On the upper part of the
screen there are fifteen lights for visual level indication. The LCD screen displays
the user’s blood alcohol equivalent concentration to two decimal places. On the
bottom part of the screen there are four boxes for user instructions (step1, step2,
step3 and Wait). The device starts working when money is inserted into the
machine. After the WAIT light goes on and the system performs a cleaning
process, the BLOW light goes on a there is beep when the device is ready to
accept an air sample. As the user exhales with the straw into the hole, the device
monitors breath volume and blowing time. If the flow of the breath sample is
sufficient, the indicator BLOW light goes from flashing to solid and the WAIT
light goes on. Thereafter the system processes the air sample.
2. Principle of Operation:
The sensing material in gas sensors is metal oxide (SnO ). When the SnO is
2 2
heated at a certain high temperature in air, oxygen is adsorbed on the crystal
surface with a negative charge. Then donor electrons in the crystal surface are
transferred to the adsorbed oxygen, resulting in leaving positive charges in a
space charge layer. Thus, surface potential is formed to serve as a potential barrier
against electron flow. Inside the sensor, electric current flows through the
conjunction parts (grain boundary) of SnO micro crystals. At grain boundaries,
2
adsorbed oxygen forms a potential barrier which prevents carriers from moving
1

freely. The electrical resistance of the sensor is attributed to this potential barrier.
In the presence of a deoxidizing gas, the surface density of the negatively charged
oxygen decreases, so the barrier height in the grain boundary is reduced. The
reduced barrier height decreases sensor resistance. The relationship between
sensor resistance and the concentration of gas is expressed by an equation to
determine the alcohol concentration.
3. Modes of Operation:
This device has only one mode of operation. See section 2 above.
4. Specimen Identification:
There is no mechanism to identify the specimen.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The user provides a breath sample by exhaling into the device.
6. Calibration:
The device is calibrated at the factory and sent directly to the end user. The
sponsor recommends a recalibration interval of every 300 tests or every three
months. These intervals are based on calibration stability data collected
internally. The unit can be sent back to the factory for calibration or calibrated by
the user following the calibration instructions in the user manual.
Traceability
This device is traceable to a commercially available certified alcohol reference
solution at a concentration of 0.10 % BAC. This solution is used to calibrate the
devices during manufacture.
7. Quality Control:
There are no external quality controls available for these types of devices for
over-the-counter use.

L. Test Principle:
The electrochemical fuel cell alcohol sensor in this device reacts with exhaled alcohol
from the breath. As the alcohol gas passes through the cell, it initiates a chemical
reaction resulting in a voltage change. This voltage change can then be converted to a
breath alcohol concentration which in turn is converted to a blood alcohol
concentration.

1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
The sponsor performed a consumer study to determine if consumers could
correctly use and interpret the device using only the supplied instructions on
the front panel, and to compare the results to a previously cleared device
(AlcoMateCA2000). There were 65 paired comparisons, and the volunteers
ranged in ages from 25 to 65 years (12 females and 53 males). Immediately
after using the IA ALIS, the participants were administered a breath alcohol
test using an AlcoMateCA2000 operated by a trained individual. The breath
alcohol concentrations ranged from 0.00%BAC to 0.16%BAC (by the
AlcoMateCA2000). Linear regression analysis of the data yielded a slope of
0.9976, a y-intercept of 0 and a correlation coefficient of 0.9892. After the
study, participants were asked questions about ease of use and interpretation.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
This device was not eligible for testing by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration (NHTSA). The sponsor performed their own testing
and collected performance data using the NHTSA requirements for precision
and accuracy as a guide. These tests consist of 20 trials at a Blood Alcohol
Concentration (BAC) of 0.00, 20 trials at a BAC of 0.008, and 20 trials at a
BAC of 0.032. Blood Alcohol Concentrations are simulated in breath by a
Breath Alcohol Sample Simulator (BASS), “MARK IIA SIMULATOR”,
which provides an alcohol-in-air test sample with known alcohol level.

The acceptance criteria for the Model Specifications are: not more than one
negative result at 0.032 BAC, not more than one positive result at 0.008 BAC,
and not more than one negative greater than zero and no positives at 0.000
BAC. NOTE: for the purposes of this study, a BAC of 0.020 is used to
distinguish a positive from a negative result.
The IA ALIS met all of the applicable NHTSA requirements for precision and
accuracy.
c. Linearity:
This device will report concentrations from 0.00 to 0.400% BAC However,
the DOT Model Specifications require accuracy and precision testing up to a
concentration of 0.032% BAC only; therefore, true linearity over the entire
measuring range of the device was not evaluated. This device met all of the
applicable NHTSA requirements for precision and accuracy as described
above.
d. Carryover:
Carryover studies are not required by NHTSA and were not performed using
this device.
e. Interfering Substances:
The DOT Model Specifications require testing with cigarette smoke to assess
any possible interference. Five trials are required at 0.000 BAC. An alcohol
free individual who smokes cigarettes is appropriate for this trial. The subject
is asked to smoke approximately one half of a cigarette. Within one minute
after smoking, or after a waiting period specified in the manufacturer’s
instructions*, the subject performs the breath alcohol test according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The subject is then asked to smoke another
inhalation and repeat the test to produce a total of five trials. The acceptance
criterion for this trial is: no positive results. The IA ALIS device had no
positive results.
*The manufacturer does not specify an exact wait time but for testing cigarette
smoke interference, a wait time of one minute was used. The labeling
indicates waiting 10 minutes after drinking or smoking before testing gives
better results.
Other potential interferents were not evaluated with this device.
Temperature:
The DOT/NHTSA Model Specifications require testing at 10 and 40 ˚C to
assess any possible effects of temperature.

At 10ºC, 20 trials are required at 0.008 BAC and 20 trials are required at
0.032 BAC. Acceptance criteria are: not more than one positive result at 0.008
BAC, and not more than one non-positive result at 0.032 BAC. The Impair
Aware Alcohol Level Indication System had no positive results at 0.008 BAC
and no non-positive results at 0.032 BAC.
At 40ºC, the requirements are identical. In this study the Impair Aware
Alcohol Level Indication System had no positive results at 0.008 BAC and no
non-positive results at 0.032 BAC.
Vibration:
The DOT/NHTSA Model Specifications require vibration testing to assess
any possible vibration related effects.
Twenty trials are required at 0.008 BAC and 0.032 BAC. Acceptance criteria
are: not more than one positive result at 0.008 BAC, and not more than one
non-positive result at 0.032 BAC.
The Impair Aware Alcohol Level Indication System had no positive results at
0.008 BAC and no non-positive results at 0.032 BAC.
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
L. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
