clinical chemistry system. Measurements of sirolimus are used as an aid in the
management of sirolimus therapy in renal transplant patients.
The sirolimus calibrator is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of
sirolimus (SIRO) on the Dimension® clinical chemistry system.
2. Indication(s) for use:
See intended use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
See expected values section, below.
For prescription use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use on the DIMENSION® instrument.
I. Device Description:
The reagent cartridge consists of wells containing the following:
Form Ingredient Concentration Source
Liquid Ab-ß-galactosidase mouse monoclonal
Tablets Sirolimus-CrO2 30 mg/tab
Tablets CPRG 8.4 mg/tab
Liquid Substrate Diluent
Liquid Pretreatment reagent
Tablets contain excipients, buffers, and stabilizers.
The calibrator is supplied as a frozen liquid product packaged as a single vial for each of
five levels. The matrix is human whole blood hemolysate with preservatives. Levels 2, 3,
4, and 5 contain sirolimus drug at target values of 5, 10, 20, and 30 ng/mL, respectively.
Level 1 is a human whole blood hemolysate that does not contain sirolimus.
The calibrators contain human source material. Each donor unit used in the preparation of
this product was tested by FDA-approved methods for the presence of antibodies to
2

Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) and Type 2 (HIV-2), as well as for
Hepatitis B surface Antigen and antibody to Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), and found to be
negative (not repeatedly reactive). Because no testing can offer complete assurance that
these or other infectious agents are absent, this material should be handled using good
laboratory practice to avoid skin contact and ingestion.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Abbott IMx Sirolimus Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay
.
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
k042411
3. Comparison with predicate:
Both the Dimension® and the predicate sirolimus assay have similar intended use
and both are enzyme immunoassays. They are for use on different instrument
systems and reagents and antibodies differ. Sample pretreatment is automatic on
the Dimension System; pretreatment is performed manually for the predicate
device.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None noted by the sponsor.
L. Test Principle:
The automated Dimension® SIRO method uses an immunoassay technique in which
free and sirolimus-bound antibody-enzyme conjugates are separated using magnetic
particles. The assay is performed using a method specific Flex® reagent cartridge.
The Flex® cartridge contains a pretreatment reagent, antibody-ß-galactosidase
conjugate, sirolimus immobilized on chromium dioxide particles, chlorophenol red ß-
d-galactopyranoside (CPRG) substrate, and diluent to hydrate the tablets. The
Dimension® system automatically mixes and lyses the whole blood sample. The
lysed sample is then mixed with the antibody enzyme conjugate. The sirolimus
present in the sample is bound by the sirolimus antibody conjugate reagent. Magnetic
particles coated with sirolimus are added to bind free (unbound) antibody-enzyme
conjugate. The reaction mixture is then separated magnetically. Following separation,
the supernatant containing the sirolimus-antibody-enzyme complex is transferred to
another cuvette and mixed with the substrate. ß-galactosidase catalyzes the hydrolysis
of CPRG (chlorophenol red ß-d-galactopyranoside) to produce CPR (chlorophenol
red) that absorbs light maximally at 577 nm. The change in absorbance at 577 nm due
3

--- Page 4 ---
to the formation of CPR is directly proportional to the amount of sirolimus in the
patient’s sample and is measured using a bichromatic (577, 700 nm) rate technique.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted internally, and at two external sites. One
reagent product lot and 1 instrument was evaluated at each site. For each test
level, samples were measured in duplicate twice per day, for 20 days (total n=80).
Testing was conducted with one reagent lot across multiple instruments at one
internal and two external locations. The repeatability and within-lab standard
deviations were calculated by the analysis of variance method independently for
each site. Samples included whole blood pools as well as quality control
materials. Results are shown below for the study at the manufacutrer’s site:
Sample Mean SD(ng/mL) %CV SD(ng/mL) %CV

Mean within run %CV total % CV
5.2 9.2 9.2
8.8 9.0 9.0
10.5 7.6 8.1
In addition, an analysis of replicate samples from the method comparison study was
performed. The pooled replicate SD results were as follows: for samples ranging from
2.0 to 5.9 ng/mL, SD = 0.284 ng/mL; for samples ranging from 6.0 to 10.9 ng/mL,
SD =0.347; for samples greater than 11.0 ng/mL, pooled replicate SD =
0.413ng/mL.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The manufacturer’s claimed assay range is 2.0-30 ng/mL.
Linearity was evaluated with samples prepared using a sirolimus stock solution
spiked into a whole blood transplant patient pool to produce concentrations across
the assay range. Each sample was assayed five times in random order. The mean
observed result (y) was plotted against the expected concentration (x). The data
was analyzed by linear regression and yielded slope of (1.01) and intercept of (0.08
ng/mL). Recoveries relative to the expected concentrations determined
gravimetrically, are tabulated below:
Dimension SIRO Linearity/Recovery
Expected Measured % Recovery
0 0.4 -
2 2.2 107.7%
5 4.8 95.5%
10 9.2 92.4%
15 16.4 109.6%
31 31.2 100.8%
The method for diluting high samples recommended in the manufacturer’s
package insert was validated with patient samples containing sirolimus at high
concentrations. Samples were diluted 1:1 with calibrator. Observed percents
recovery (averaged across replicates of each individual sample) relative to
expected concentrations ranged from -4% to -7%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrator values are traceable to values determined by two HPLC-MS-MS
methods (which were described in the 510(k)). In an analysis of a representative
calibrator lot, calibrator values measured by the Dimension SIRO assay recovered
within 90-99% of the HPLC-MS-MS methods.

Calibrator stability was evaluated at multiple time points under various storage
conditions, including all storage conditions recommended to users in the labeling.
Open-Vial stability studies were conducted under conditions of 2-8 degrees.
Observed percent drift within 30 days ranged from -5 to -6%. Under conditions
of -20 degrees C, calibrator recovery was within +/- 10% throughout expiration
dating claim. The “control” calibrator was stored at -70 degrees C during testing.
Multiple lots were included in the evaluation.
d. Detection limit:
A precision study was conducted using samples prepared by spiking sirolimus
drug into EDTA whole blood at multiple concentrations near the lower assay
limit. The study was conducted over 20 days, 2 runs per day with samples run in
duplicate (n=80). Each of 3 lots was tested (at different times) and evaluated
separately. The within-lab %CV was plotted against the sample concentration. At
a concentration of 2.0 ng/mL (the claimed lower limit of the assay) the within-lab
%CV was ≤ 20%. In addition, a sample at 2 ng/mL was included in the linearity
study. Recovery at 2.0 ng/mL was approximately 108%. These data support the
lower limit of the analytical measuring range of 2.0 ng/mL claimed by the
manufacturer.
e. Analytical specificity:
Studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of potential interferents on assay
performance. Potential sources of interference evaluated included endogenous
compounds, co-administered immunosuppressive drugs including cyclosporine,
mycophenolic acid and its metabolite MPAG, tacrolimus and common co-
administered drugs with which the sample is likely to come in contact.
Endogenous compounds
Interference from endogenous compounds was evaluated by preparing test
samples containing the potential interferent in the presence of 6 ng/mL and 18
ng/mL sirolimus in whole blood hemolysate. All samples were assayed in
replicates of five and the mean was used in the analysis. The interference of each
compound was calculated as: Interference = (Test sample – Blank)/ Blank x
100%. Recoveries observed were within +/- 10%, as shown below.

Cross-reactivity
Four major sirolimus metabolites were evaluated for cross-reactivity, at a
concentration of 25 ng/mL, in the presence of 0 ng/mL [0.0 nmol/L] and 12
ng/mL [13.2 nmol/L] sirolimus. The percent cross-reactivity was calculated as
follows:
measured sirolimus – control sirolimus (ng/mL [nmol/L])
% cross rct = -------------------------------------------------------------------------- x 100
metabolite added
Percent Cross-reactivities observed under these conditions are summarized below.
(The ranges refer to cross-reactivities observed under the two sirolimus
concentrations tested):
16-O-demethyl sirolimus 6-10%
12-hydroxy sirolimus 46-53%
39-O-demethyl sirolimus 52-53%
27,39-O-didesmethyl sirolimus 83- 89%
Co-administered drugs and physiological substances
Interference from commonly co-administered drugs, including
immunosuppressive drugs was evaluated. A sample was prepared containing the
co-administered drug in the presence of 6 ng/mL and 18 ng/mL sirolimus in
whole blood. The sample containing the co-administered drug was compared to
the control, which contained only 6 ng/ml or 18 ng/mL sirolimus in whole blood
(no drug). All samples were assayed n=5 and the mean result were calculated. At
the concentrations tested, the co-administered drugs did not cause significant
interference with the assay, as defined by the manufacturer. All recoveries were
within +/- 10% of the control samples.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable – this is a quantitative assay.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were conducted at two external clinical sites. There
were a total of 119 samples from adult kidney transplant patients (EDTA plasma)
7

--- Page 8 ---
evaluated at these sites. All samples evaluated were trough (C0) samples. The
majority of the samples were from one draw per patient. In cases where patient
samples were from two draws per patient, these were separated in time (2 weeks
to 4 months). In addition, analysis of the data showed there was no significant
effect of repeat measurements (from a single patient) on the regression statistics.
The range of time post transplant was 7 weeks to 25 years. Samples were
measured by the Dimension SIRO method and a well-validated HPLC-MS
method.
The linear regression provided a slope of 1.2 (95% CI = 1.13 to 1.27) with an
intercept of -0.7 (95% CI = -1.26 to -0.06), correlation coefficient (r) of 0.95 and
Sy/x of 1.2 ng/mL. These results, and the graph below were derived from the
mean of HPLC/MS results compared to the first replicate for the Dimension RXL
SIRO assay. Data from both sites were poolable, and are shown combined below.

typically provided in 510(k)s for this type of assay.
b. Clinical specificity: See a, above.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Data
regarding patient demographics and selection criteria were provided in the
method comparison evaluation in the 510(k).
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable; this is a quantitative assay.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The following is stated in the package insert:
The optimal concentration range for sirolimus in whole blood using this assay has not
been established. Optimal concentration ranges vary according to the specific assay
used, and therefore should be established for each specific assay. Values obtained
with different assay methods should not be used interchangeably due to differences in
cross-reactivity with metabolites, nor should correction factors be applied.
Laboratories should include identification of the assay used in order to aid in
interpretation of results. Each institution should establish the optimal ranges based on
the specific assay used and other factors relevant to their patient population. Optimal
ranges depend upon the patient’s clinical state, individual differences in sensitivity to
immunosuppressive and nephrotoxic effects of sirolimus, co-administration of other
immunosuppressants, time post transplant and a number of other factors. Therefore,
individual sirolimus values cannot be used as the sole indicator for making changes in
treatment regimen and each patient should be thoroughly evaluated clinically before
changes in treatment regimens are made.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
