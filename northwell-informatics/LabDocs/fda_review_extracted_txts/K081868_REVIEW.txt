L. Test Principle:
For the Leishmania assays, a tissue specimen (skin scraping or punch biopsy) from an
individual suspected of being infected with Leishmania species or L. major is
collected in 70% or 100% ethanol, and the DNA is extracted from the specimen using
the Qiagen QIAamp DNA Mini Kit. An aliquot of this DNA is tested using the
Leishmania genus assay, which will amplify a portion of DNA encoding the
Leishmania species 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene if present.
Amplified targets are detected using a TaqMan® hybridization probe with 6-carboxy-
fluorescein (FAM) reporter dye and a Black Hole Quencher® (BHQ). This assay
also contains a positive internal control consisting of a nonsensical, non-naturally

occurring DNA sequence, with Texas Red reporter dye and BHQ, used to detect
evidence of PCR inhibition and confirm the integrity of assay reagents in negative
specimens. If the sample tests positive for Leishmania species, another aliquot of
DNA may be tested using the L. major assay, which will amplify a portion of DNA
encoding the GPI gene that is specific to L. major. Amplified targets are detected
using a TaqMan hybridization probe with FAM reporter dye and a BHQ. The DNA
amplification, detection of fluorescence, and interpretation of signals are done
automatically by the SmartCycler instrument for each assay. The thermocycling
protocols take approximately 45–55 minutes.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Studies were conducted to evaluate the reproducibility of the SMART Leish
assay. The precision of the Leishmania genus and L. major assays between
laboratories was evaluated using purified L. major DNA and cultured L. major
parasites. Additionally, between-laboratory precision of the assays was
evaluated using mock human samples (punch biopsies from porcine tissue
injected with L. major parasites).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The assay linearity of SMART Leish for Leishmania genus and Leishmania
major was determined using eight different concentrations of purified L.
major DNA tested in a 10-fold dilution series from 14.26 ng to 0.001426 pg
and 21.39ng to 0.002139 pg, respectively, DNA per reaction.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

d. Detection limit:
In addition to the LOD determination, six different concentrations of
purified L. major parasites were tested in a 10-fold dilution of 5 X 102
parasites/mL (equivalent to 107 to 102 parasites/extraction) to determine the
minimum number of L. major parasites that can be taken through the
extraction and testing procedure and still give a positive result for the
SMART Leish assays (extraction LOD). The following tables summarize
the results of the assay LOD for the L. genus and L. major assays, and
summarizes the results of the extraction LOD (eLOD) study.

LOD was determined across different operators, different days, and using
multiple L. major strains.
e. Analytical specificity:
A total of 121 DNA samples were evaluated in the specificity study. The
DNA from 11 Leishmania major strains tested in this study gave robust
positive results with the Leishmania major PCR assay. Twenty-five non-
Leishmania major samples tested negative; hence the analytical specificity
was 100%. The percentage of false positives was 0%, and the percentage of
false negatives is 0%. In the Leishmania genus study, 85 of the 121 samples
were non-target DNA samples. Eighty-five were negative, 2 false positives
and 36 were positive. The analytical specificity of the Leishmania genus PCR
assay was 98.3%, false positive rate was 2.4% and the false negative rate was
0%. See the following table for a list of organisms used in the study. Nucleic
acids from non-target organisms were tested for both the Leishmania genus
and Leishmania major assays. DNA samples with concentrations used in this
study included purified DNA from bacteria (52; conc =50 - 46,250 pg/uL),
fungi (11; conc= 50,000 – 97,000 pg/uL ), viruses (7; conc= 5,950 – 30,990
pg/uL), mammals (3; conc = 20 pg/uL (human, bovine, and murine)), human
melanoma cell lines (3; conc = 10,200 – 25,200 pg/uL), Leishmania major
(11; conc = 21,540 – 83,000 pg/uL), 25 additional Leishmania species (not-L.
major) (conc = 16,680 – 592,00 pg/uL), and 9 trypanosomes representing 6
species (conc = 12,760 – 95,000 pg/uL).

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The clinical performance of the SMART Leish assay was established in a
multi-center, retrospective clinical study conducted at two military U.S.
hospital sites. A total of 303 prospective specimens were collected from adults
18 years or older and evaluated in the SMART Leish assay and compared to
culture and/or microscopy. Evaluated specimens were skin lesion scrapings
and punch biopsies from individuals suspected of having cutaneous
leishmaniasis. The patient population consisted entirely of military personnel
who were at the time, or had previously been, deployed to Southwest Asia—
primarily Afghanistan and Iraq. SMART Leish performance versus culture
and microcopy, including 95% confidence intervals, is detailed below. For the
BAMC study, DNA was extracted from specimens and Leishmania genus and
L. major assays were run. For the WRAIR study, Leishmania genus and L.
major assays were run on archived DNA samples that were previously
extracted from clinical specimens. For both studies, the results were
compared to “clinical truth” that had been established for each specimen or
sample.

The assay is performed on the automated Cepheid SmartCycler Dx System. The
SmartCycler Dx System is a real time thermal cycler used for identifying DNA or
RNA from prepared samples. Each instrument contains 16 independently
programmable I-CORE modules, each with one reaction site. Thermally
optimized proprietary reaction tubes combined with the unique design of the I-
CORE modules allow very rapid cycling and faster amplification and detection.
Up to six SmartCycler II processing blocks can be daisy-chained together,
11

allowing simultaneous analysis of up to 96 discrete samples.
The SmartCycler Dx System is suited to in vitro diagnostic assays that require
automatic, repeated, rapid heating and cooling cycles for test samples, such as PCR
and RT-PCR. Specific sequences can be detected using hybridization probes. The
system has the capacity to store any number of runs, limited only by available disk
space. All assay data and results are stored in a database.
. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes ____x____ or No ________
The software controls the operation of the I-CORE module, and collects, analyzes
and interprets the acquired optical data. This software has been determined to be
a moderate level of concern.
3. Specimen Identification:
• User enters the sample identifiers under the “Sample ID Column” before
starting the run.
• User inserts each reaction tube into the assigned site of the SmartCycler.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
• Collected specimens should be stored in 70% - 100% ethanol. During
shipment, the samples can be kept at ambient temperature, 200 C – 290 C.
• Once received, samples should be stored at 2°C–8°C until tested.
• Extracted DNA samples must be stored in the AE buffer provided in the
Qiagen kit and may be stored at 2°C–8°C for up to 3 days.
• DNA extracts in AE buffer may be stored for more than 3 days in a –20°C
freezer. Avoid multiple freeze–thaw cycles of the samples.
5. Calibration:
The thermistors used to monitor the reaction chamber temperature are calibrated
to
±0.50°C using National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-traceable
standards. The optical system is calibrated using standard concentrations of the
individual unquenched dye-oligo standard to determine the spectral
characteristics.
The instrument performs optics self-test before each run start to verify that the
optical system is functioning properly.

6. Quality Control:
Positive DNA controls are provided in the assay kit. The positive extraction
control (Leishmania mexicana parasites) and negative controls (molecular biology
grade water) are materials required but not supplied. One positive DNA Control
and one negative DNA Control are processed for each assay run on the
SmartCycler Dx System. The software automatically assigns the positive DNA
Control to the second to last position, and the negative DNA control to the last
position.
The positive DNA control monitors for reagent failure and operator error. The
negative DNA control monitors reagent or environmental contamination (or
carry-over). The positive extraction control monitors for extraction failure and
operator error. The negative extraction control monitors for reagent
contamination and environmental contamination in the extraction process.
The internal control (IC) verifies functional PCR reagents and the absence of
inhibition
that would prevent PCR amplification. DNA for the IC is included in one of the
reagent
beads within the Smart Leish Assay. The response of the IC in the presence of
inhibitors correlates with the response of target DNA in the presence of inhibitors.
Before start of PCR reaction, the SmartCycler Dx System is programmed to
perform an
optical measurement or probe check on the optical channels associated with
Leishmania target and Internal Control detection. The Probe Check control
verifies reagent bead
rehydration, appropriate tube filling, probe integrity, and dye stability. Probe
Check is
considered to PASS if optical measurements meet the validated acceptance
criteria. If the
Probe Check fails in either optical channel, the test will not continue.
The System Control Check for Temperature Control ensures that the SmartCycler
Dx
Instrument is operating within specification.
