I. Device Description:
The XT-Series is an automated hematology analyzer using Hydrodynamic Focusing,
flow cytometry method, and SLS-hemoglobin method for analysis of IG and RET-He
in EDTA anti-coagulated blood samples. The IG parameter is measured in the DIFF
channel, cells are detected by a combination of side scattered, forward scatter, and
fluorescent intensity. Abnormal and immature cells are clustered and
indistinguishable in the DIFF scattergram. The RET-He parameter is measured in the
reticulocyte channel; cells are stained with polymethine dye which stains RNA
differentiating reticulocytes from mature RBCs. The reticulocyte parameters are
derived from the reticulocyte histogram, which is generated by the forward light
signals.

L. Test Principle:
IG parameter: When blood is diluted and stained with Stomatolyzer-4DL, mature
leukocytes and red blood cells are selectively lysed, leaving immature
granulocytes intact due to its lower phospholipid content. In the optical detector
block, the sample is analyzed via flow cytometry method utilizing a
semiconductor laser.
RET-He parameter: When blood is stained with polymethine dye in the
reticulocyte channel, the sample is analyzed by automated fluorescent flow
cytometry method. The analyzer measures the mean value of the forward light
scatter histogram of mature red blood cells and reticulocytes.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Quality control and residual samples were used. E-Check Quality Control
materials, 3 levels, were assayed for 20 days. Five residual samples were
assayed 10 consecutives times. Results met manufacturer specification and
testing criteria as follows:
Parameter Specification Testing Criteria
IG% CV% ≤25%, or within ±1.5 IG% IG% ≥ 2%, WBC ≥ 4.00 x 103 /µL
IG# CV% ≤25%, or within ±0.12 x 103/µL IG#: 0.1 x 103 /µL
RET-He CV% ≤5% RET#: ≥ 0.020 x 106 /µL
b. Linearity/assay reportable range
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability: Samples should be stored at room temperature (18-26ºC) and
refrigerated temperature (2-8ºC). The variation from 0 hour after the blood
collection to 24 hours was calculated and met manufacturer specification.
• 30 normal samples were used in the IG stability study. The variation IG
from was within ± 2 IG%
• 30 samples with RET-He ≥ 0.010 x 106 /µL were used in the RET-He
stability study. The variation for RET-He was within ± 8%.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
272 samples were collected and analyzed at two sites. The study included
abnormal samples with a variety of disease states such as anemia, iron
deficiency, thalassemia, immature granulocytes, blast forms, left shift,
atypical/abnormal lymphocytes, high WBC counts, lipemia, NRBCs, etc.
Results met manufacturer specification, r ≥0.90, as follows:
