H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The ADVIA Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c method is for in vitro diagnostic use in the
quantitative determination of Hemoglobin A1c, a diabetes marker, in whole blood on the
ADVIA Chemistry systems. Such measurements are used for monitoring the long-term
glycemic control of persons with diabetes. The A1c and total hemoglobin (tHb) values
generated as part of the HbA1cN and HbA1cI results are intended for use in the
calculation of the A1c/total hemoglobin ratio, and must not be used individually for
diagnostic purposes.
*Note: HbA1cN reports HbA1c in % and HbA1cI reports HbA1c in mmol/mol
The ADVIA Chemistry A1c Calibrators are for in vitro diagnostic use in the calibration
of the A1c and total hemoglobin methods (Automated and Manual Pretreatment) on the
ADVIA Chemistry System.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
The sponsor has the following limitation stated in their labeling:
“Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) consists of two alpha and two gamma chains that are not
recognized by the anti-HbA1c antibody. Samples containing high amounts of Hb F
(>10%), usually found in some people with Thalassemia, in infants and in some pregnant
women, may yield a lower than expected HbA1c result with this method. For blood
samples containing HbF (>10%), HbA1c results obtained by this method should not be
compared to published normal or abnormal results.”
4. Special instrument requirements:

Calibrators:
The ADVIA® Chemistry A1c Calibrators are used to calibrate the methods. The calibrators
consist of four (4) levels of lyophilized whole blood containing varying concentrations of
HbA1c and total hemoglobin. There is a single level calibration for total hemoglobin (Cal 1)
and a multi-level calibration (six levels) for A1c. Four calibrator levels (designated Cal 1 –
4) are in a single kit. The other two levels consist of Saline (Cal 0) and Cal 5 (prepared by
the system from Cal 4 using 1.4 times the volume used for Cal 4).
The human blood used in the manufacture of these calibrators has been tested using FDA
approved methods and found to be non-reactive for HBsAg and antibodies to HCV and HIV-
1/2.

L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c assay measures the concentration of A1c and total
hemoglobin and reports the ratio in either % or mmol/mol. There are two different sample
pretreatment methods available on the ADVIA Chemistry system.
1.) The first method is an automated sample pretreatment that uses 4 reagents: A1c
Denaturant Reagent, A1c Agglutinator Reagent (R1), A1c Antibody Reagent (R2), and
Total hemoglobin Reagent (tHb-2). In this automated pretreatment step, the whole blood
sample is mixed with the A1c Denaturant Reagent. The red blood cells are lysed and the
hemoglobin chains are hydrolyzed by the protease present in the reagent. The HbA1c
present in the sample then competes with the agglutinator for the anti-HbA1c antibody;
thereby reducing the rate of agglutination. A concentration curve is obtained by
monitoring the change in scattered light as a change of absorbance. The actual change in
absorbance is inversely proportional to the concentration of HbA1c in the sample.
For the measurement of total hemoglobin, the Total Hemoglobin Reagent (tHb-2) is used.
The method is based on the conversion of all hemoglobin derivatives into alkaline
hematin in an alkaline solution of a nonionic detergent as described in the original
procedure of Wolf, Lang, and Zander.
ii.) The second method is a manual sample pretreatment that uses the same reagents as the
first method except that the A1c Denaturant Reagent is replaced with the Hemoglobin
Denaturant Reagent. For this method, there is an off-line pretreatment that is followed by
ten minute incubation.
Two ratio calculations are provided to the customer. The first (HbA1cN) reports results in
NGSP equivalent units (%) while the second ratio (HbA1cI) reports results in IFCC
equivalents units (mmol/mol).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study across the entire measuring range was assessed using
commercially available linearity set solutions. The low and high levels of the
linearity set were mixed to make seven intermediate levels and all samples were
tested on the various platforms using the ADVIA Chemistry HbA1c. The range of
samples tested was from 2.9-15.4% A1c. The observed values were compared to the
expected values. The percent recovery between the observed values verses the
expected values for all the platforms are shown in the table below. In addition,
linear regressions correlations summary for all platforms (observed vs. expected
values) are shown in the table below:

The data provided support the sponsor’s claims that the reportable range of this assay
is 2.9-15.4% A1c.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The assigned A1c and total hemoglobin (tHb) values of the calibrators are traceable
to the NGSP reference method (Tosoh G7) through a correlation study. The ADVIA
Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c assay is certified with the National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program (NGSP). The NGSP certification expires in one year. See
NGSP website for current certification at http://www.ngsp.org.
The derived result of the ratio (%) from the NGSP correlation is calculated from the
individual quantitative results for total hemoglobin (tHb) and Hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c). The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) units of
mmol/mol are calculated using the Master Equation:
IFCC = (NGSP- 2.15) / 0.092
Two different units are provided to the customers:
NGSP equivalent units (%) and IFCC equivalents units (mmol/mol)

Value assignment:
The initial lot of calibrators (master lot) was value assigned through a correlation
study using samples provided by the NGSP with values determined on the Tosoh G7.
Based on the correlation study with the NGSP Reference method, the total
hemoglobin and A1c values for the Master Lot were established. All subsequent lots
will be value assigned against the Master Lot.
Stability:
The shelf life and open vial stability testing protocols for the calibrators and the
acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. Calibrators are stable
until expiration date when stored at 2-8oC and stable for 7 days at 2-8oC once
reconstituted with deionized water.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined by assaying
a zero sample and a low sample according to the CLSI guideline EP17-A. Each
sample was assayed twice a day in duplicate for 20 days (N=80) on the ADVIA
systems. The detection limits were summarized in the table shown below.

analyte recovery should not vary from the base recovery by no more than 10%.
No significant interference was defined as the % recovery of ≤ 10%.
The sponsor claimed that there was no significant interference by the following
interferents:
• Conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin up to 60.0 mg/dL
• Triglycerides (Intralipid) up to 500 mg/dL
• Rheumatoid factor up to 1100 IU/mL
ii.) An interference study was performed to assess the effect of labile A1c with the
ADVIA A1c assay. Two levels of pooled whole blood samples (~5% and 10%
A1c) were used and each pool was split into two aliquots. One aliquot was used as
the control sample while the other aliquot was supplemented by dissolving 0.030
g (30mg) of glucose into the pool sample (glucose concentration = 1500 mg/dL).
The sample was incubated for five hours at 37°C to facilitate formation of labile
A1c. Both aliquots were tested on the ADVIA 1800 analyzer using the
Automated Pretreatment and Manual Pretreatment methods. The sponsor’s
acceptance criterion is ≤ 10% bias between the tested and the control samples.
The sponsor concluded that labile A1c concentrations do not interfere with the
ADVIA A1c assay.
iii.) An interference study was performed to assess the effect of carbamylated A1c
with the ADVIA A1c assay. Two levels of pooled whole blood samples (~5% and
10% A1c) were used and each pool was split into two aliquots. One aliquot was
used as the control sample while the other aliquot was supplemented by
dissolving 3 mg of urea into the pool sample (urea concentration = 150 mg/dL).
The sample was incubated for two hours at 37°C to facilitate formation of
carbamylated A1c. Both aliquots were tested on the ADVIA 1800 analyzer using
the Automated Pretreatment and Manual Pretreatment methods. The sponsor’s
acceptance criterion is ≤ 10% bias between the tested and the control samples.
The sponsor concluded that carbamylated A1c concentrations do not interfere
with the ADVIA A1c assay.
iv.) A hemoglobin concentration interference study was done on the ADVIA 1800 by
testing varying concentrations of total hemoglobin at the same level of %A1c.
Five individual normal donors were used for the study. The acceptance criterion
for the hemoglobin interference was %HbA1c at different hemoglobin levels must
be within 0.95-1.05% of target %HbA1c. The results met the sponsor’s
predetermined acceptance criteria and the sponsor concluded that total
hemoglobin in the range of 7 to 26 g/dL does not interfere with the ADVIA A1c
assay.
v.) A hemoglobin variant interference study was carried out using NGSP samples
known to be Hemoglobin variants C, E, F and S. These variant samples were
10

--- Page 11 ---
tested on the Primus Ultra 2 HPLC system and the ADVIA 1200, 1650/1800, and
2400 using the automated pretreatment method. All the variants tested showed
<12% bias except Hemoglobin F at concentrations of F greater than 10%.
Hemoglobin F variant >10% showed a negative bias therefore, the sponsor has the
following limitation stated in their labeling:
“Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) consists of two alpha and two gamma chains that are
not recognized by the anti-HbA1c antibody. Samples containing high amounts of
Hb F (>10%), usually found in some people with Thalassemia, in infants and in
some pregnant women, may yield a lower than expected HbA1c result with this
method. For blood samples containing HbF (>10%), HbA1c results obtained by
this method should not be compared to published normal or abnormal results.”
See NGSP at http://www.ngsp.org for assay interferences with hemoglobin
variants.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed in conjunction with the NGSP guidelines
for manufacturer certification using the reference laboratory. The study was
completed using 80 (two sets of forty frozen whole blood samples in EDTA) patients
split between the reference lab and the sponsor. Each sample was analyzed in
duplicate on each ADVIA Chemistry System (ADVIA 1200, 1650/1800 and 2400)
using both sample pretreatment formats (Automated and Manual Pretreatment
methods). After completion of the testing, the reference lab provided the sponsor
with the sample values obtained on the Tosoh G7 HbA1c HPLC system (predicate
device). Sample range tested was 4.4%- 12.6% A1c. The linear regression
correlation using only the first set of replicates (singlicate values) are summarized as
follows:

In addition, a separate comparison study was performed between the candidate
device and another commerically available device using the automated method on
the ADVIA 2400 analyzer. The linear regression correlation is summarized in the
table below:

b. Matrix comparison:
A total of 40 random matched sample pairs (Potassium EDTA, Lithium heparin) were
tested on the ADVIA 1650/1800 using the Automated and Manual Pretreatment
methods. The linear regression correlation was calculated as follows:
For Automated pretreatment method:
y= 0.98x + 0.07, r= 0.991, sample range tested = 4.7-7.9%
For Manual pretreatment method:
y= 0.97x - 0.02, r= 0.998, sample range tested = 4.8-12.1%
(x=Potassium EDTA, y=Lithium heparin)
The sponsor recommends that EDTA and Lithium heparin can be used as anticoagulants.
