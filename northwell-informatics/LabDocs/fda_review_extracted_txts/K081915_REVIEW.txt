H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
For in vitro diagnostic use (i.e. for external use only) by healthcare professionals
and in the home by people with diabetes mellitus to assess the performance of the
Contour Blood Glucose Monitor.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Over-The-Counter Use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Bayer Ascensia Contour Blood Glucose Monitor
I. Device Description:
The FDTX Glucose Control Solution consists of a viscosity-adjusted, aqueous liquid
control solution containing a known quantity of glucose. The product is packaged in
plastic dropper tipped bottles for easy application of the control solutions to the test
strips and a red coloration to aid the user to visually confirm application of the
control. The product is nonhazardous and contains no human or animal derived
materials.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Ascensia Microfill Control Solution
2. Predicate K number(s):
k023657
3. Comparison with predicate:
Both devices contain D-Glucose and no human or animal derived materials.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI EP5-A, Evaluation of the Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices
L. Test Principle:
Not applicable
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The D-Glucose used in this control is traceable to an in-house glucose
preparation. Values are assigned by repeat analysis using three different lots
of test strips. The mean and standard deviation are used to establish the
acceptable range for each glucose monitoring system.
Stability characteristics of the FDTX Glucose Control Solution were
determined using real-time studies. The unopened shelf-life is 24 months and
the open vial stability is 90 days at the recommended storage of 36 °F to 86

range printed in the labeling for the system being used (rather than the range
printed on the test strip vial or carton.)
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
