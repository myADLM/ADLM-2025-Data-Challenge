ODE guidance 5/31/1990
L. Test Principle:
An aliquot of stool is lysed by eluting in sample buffer. The lysate is then added to PCR
reagents which contain the tcdB specific primers used to amplify the genetic target of
Clostridium difficile if present. The assay also includes an internal control (IC) to detect
PCR inhibited specimens and to confirm the integrity of assay reagents. The amplified
DNA target is detected with a molecular beacon, a hairpin-forming single-stranded
oligonucleotide labelled at one end with a quencher and at the other end with a
fluorescent reporter dye (fluorophore). In the absence of target, the fluorescence is
quenched. In the presence of target, the hairpin structure opens upon beacon/target
hybridization, resulting in emission of fluorescence. For the detection of tcdB amplicons,
the molecular beacon contains the fluorophore FAM at the 5’ end and the non-fluorescent
quencher DABCYL at the opposite 3’ end of the oligonucleotide. For the detection of the
IC amplicons, the molecular beacon contains the fluorophore TET at the 5’ end and the
quencher moiety DABCYL at the 3’ end. Each beacon-target hybrid fluoresces at a
wavelength characteristic of the fluorophore used in the particular molecular beacon. The
amount of fluorescence at any given cycle, or following cycling, depends on the amount
of specific amplicons present at that time. The amplification, detection and interpretation
of the signals and provision of a final result are done automatically by the Cepheid
SmartCycler® software. The entire procedure takes about 75 to 90 minutes, depending on
the number of specimens processed.

a. Reproducibility:
The reproducibility panel consisted of three simulated specimen categories where each
tube contained 100 μL of simulated bowel flora; the two positive panel members were
also inoculated with C. difficile (ATCC 43255). Additionally, two Specimen Processing
Controls (ATCC 9689 and ATCC 25922) and two Run Controls (Positive and Negative)
were included. The specimens were tested in triplicate per panel run, on five distinct
days. Each day two panels were tested, one for each of two technologists, at three clinical
sites with one lot of reagents. Only one of these clinical sites participated in the extended
study where two additional lots of reagents were tested.
The overall percent agreement for the low positive C. difficile specimen category is
96.7%; the moderate positive C. difficile specimen category is 100% and the negative
specimen category is 100% for the Site-to-Site Reproducibility (Table 8).
The overall percent agreement for the low positive C. difficile specimen category is
100%; the moderate positive C. difficile specimen category is 97.8% and the negative
specimen category is 100% for the Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility (Table 9).
Cycle threshold (Ct), an internal criteria used to determine a final assay result, was
selected as an additional means of assessing assay reproducibility. Overall mean Ct
values with variance components (SD and %CV) are shown in Tables 8 and 9.
An additional reproducibility study was performed, in accordance with the original
reproducibility study protocol, to assess high negative specimens below the BD
GeneOhm™ Cdiff Assay limit of detection (LOD). A sample containing simulated bowel
flora was inoculated with C. difficile (ATCC 43255) at a concentration equivalent to the
assay LOD. 100-fold and 10-fold dilutions of this sample were prepared, respectively, to
obtain the two (2) high negative panel members. Overall percent agreement for negative
test results and overall mean Ct values with variance components (SD and %CV) are
shown in Table 10. As expected, the more dilute panel member (100-fold below the
LOD) containing lower levels of target, demonstrates a higher percent agreement for
negative test results than the less dilute panel member (10-fold below the LOD) which
contains higher levels of target. Although high negative panel members are below the
analytical LOD of the assay, positive test results may still be observed due to the
presence of target in these specimens.

b. Precision:
Within-laboratory precision was evaluated for the BD GeneOhm Cdiff Assay at one
(1) site. The study was performed over 12 days, with two (2) runs per day and two (2)
sample replicates per run. Samples included simulated specimens representing low
and moderate positive C. difficile as well as negative C. difficile. One (1) out of 24
runs was excluded due to failure of the positive control (PC). One (1) moderate
positive sample produced an unresolved result. All remaining samples and controls
produced reportable results for a total of 46 replicates. Precision study results for low
and moderate positive samples demonstrated agreement for (46/46) and (45/46)
replicates, respectively; negative sample results demonstrated agreement for (46/46)
replicates.

Controls
The positive control is intended to monitor substantial reagent failure. The
negative control is used to detect reagent or environmental contamination (or
carry-over) by either DNA containing tcdB genes or tcdB amplicons. Positive and
negative controls are assay controls (run controls). An invalid control invalidates
the run. Finally, an internal control incorporated into each reaction mixture is

intended to monitor the reagent integrity and PCR inhibition in each specimen.
One positive control and one negative control must be included in each assay run
on the SmartCycler®. The software automatically assigns the position of the
controls on the instrument.
For specimen processing controls, a reference toxigenic C. difficile strain bearing
the tcdB gene (e.g. American Type Culture Collection, ATCC 43255 or a well
characterized C. difficile clinical isolate identified to be carrying the tcdB gene)
may be used as a positive specimen processing control. A culture of a non
toxigenic C. difficile strain (e.g. ATCC 700057) may be used as a negative
specimen processing control.
Stability
The stability of C. difficile (carrying the tcdB gene) crude DNA from the sample
prep procedure was determined with spiked fresh negative stool as well as fresh
positive characterized stool specimens. Tests were performed after storage for up
to 2 hrs at 25°C, 4 and 24 hrs at 4°C and after 24 hrs at -20°C (one freeze and
thaw cycle). Results were adequate.
d. Detection limit:
Quantitated culture and purified genomic DNA diluted in BD GeneOhm™ Cdiff
Assay sample buffer were tested in five (5) replicates. The LOD was defined as
the lowest concentration, in DNA copy number per reaction and CFU per
reaction, at which five replicates out of five were found positive.
The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection or LOD) of the BD GeneOhm™
Cdiff Assay was determined with one strain of Toxinotype 0 Clostridium difficile
carrying the tcdB gene (ATCC 43255).
The BD GeneOhm™ Cdiff Assay LOD is 10 DNA copies per reaction. The LOD
in Colony Forming Units (CFU) is established at 4 CFU per reaction.
The analytical sensitivity in CFU per reaction was confirmed with a second
Toxinotype 0 (ATCC 9689) and with Toxinotypes IIIa (SE84416), V (SE88116),
VII (5726716) and VIII (147016) Clostridium difficile toxigenic strains.
In addition to strains used for LOD determination, one hundred (100) other
toxigenic C. difficile strains (including 17 other Toxinotypes), representing 21
countries, from well-characterized clinical isolates or public collections were
evaluated using the BD GeneOhm™ Cdiff Assay. C. difficile strains were tested
at a concentration of approximately 6.7 DNA copies/µL or 1 CFU/µL. The assay
correctly identified all 100 C. difficile strains carrying the tcdB gene.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross Reactivity
Genomic DNA from one non toxigenic C. difficile strain, two strains of
Toxinotype XI lacking tcdB gene17 and 29 other-Clostridium strains along with 99
closely related organisms and other pathogenic and commensal flora found in the
intestine and stools (representing 96 species) were tested. All strains were tested
6

--- Page 7 ---
at a concentration of approximately 1X108 CFU/mL or 1X108 target copies/mL.
None of these species tested positive with the BD GeneOhm™ Cdiff Assay.
Interfering Substances
Twenty-six (26) biological and chemical substances occasionally used or found in
perianal, rectal and/or stool specimens were evaluated for interference with the
BD GeneOhmTM Cdiff Assay. Potentially interfering substances include, but are
not limited to, blood and mucus. The presence of excessive blood may inhibit
PCR and may give unresolved results. The remaining twenty-four (24) substances
illustrated in the table below showed no detectable interference with the BD
GeneOhmTM Cdiff Assay.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Performance characteristics of the BD GeneOhm™ Cdiff Assay were determined
in a multi-site prospective investigational study. Four (4) medical centers, two (2)
in Canada and two (2) in the United States, participated in the study. Specimens
were collected from individuals for whom Clostridium difficile testing was
indicated and/or ordered. A tissue culture cytotoxicity assay – the reference
method – was performed on the liquid or soft stool specimens within 48 hours of
collection.
A total of 1108 specimens were tested with both the cytotoxicity assay mentioned
above and the BD GeneOhm™ Cdiff Assay, producing 1090 reportable results.
The first dataset includes 835 fresh specimens tested at 3 of the 4 clinical sites
(Table 1). Overall clinical sensitivity was 93.8% and clinical specificity was
95.5% .(Table 2). For the population tested this resulted in a Negative Predictive
Value (NPV) of 99.1% and a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 67.3%.
At the fourth clinical site, frozen stool aliquots were tested with both the
cytotoxicity reference assay and the BD GeneOhm™ Cdiff Assay. The second
dataset included results from 255 frozen stool specimens (Table 3). In comparison
to the cytotoxicity assay, the BD GeneOhm™ Cdiff Assay showed a clinical
sensitivity of 100% and clinical specificity of 97.7% in the frozen dataset;

3. Specimen Identification:
A liquid or soft stool specimen is collected and transported to the laboratory. A sterile dry
swab is dipped into the liquid or soft stool material and processed.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
For testing, the swab is eluted in sample buffer and the specimen is lysed. An aliquot of
the lysate is added to PCR reagents which contain the tcdB specific primers used to
amplify the genetic target of Clostridium difficile, if present. Amplified targets are
detected with hybridization probes labeled with quenched fluorophores (molecular
beacons). The amplification, detection and interpretation of the signals are done
automatically by the Cepheid SmartCycler software. The entire procedure takes 75 to 90
minutes.

6. Quality Control:
Positive and Negative Controls
Quality control procedures are designed to monitor assay performance. The positive
control is intended to monitor substantial reagent failure. The negative control is used to
detect reagent or environmental contamination (or carry-over) by either DNA containing
tcdB genes or tcdB amplicons. Positive and negative controls are assay controls (run
controls). An invalid control invalidates the run. Finally, an internal control incorporated
into each reaction mixture is intended to monitor the reagent integrity and PCR inhibition
in each specimen.
One positive control and one negative control must be included in each assay run on the
SmartCycler®. The software automatically assigns the position of the controls on the
instrument.
Specimen Processing Controls
Additional control strains may be tested according to guidelines or requirements of local,
state and/or federal regulations or accreditation organizations. A reference toxigenic C.
difficile strain bearing the tcdB gene (e.g. American Type Culture Collection, ATCC
43255 or a well characterized C. difficile clinical isolate identified to be carrying the tcdB
gene) may be used as a positive specimen processing control while a culture of a non
toxigenic C. difficile strain (e.g. ATCC 700057) may be used as a negative specimen

processing control.
Colonies are isolated after 18 to 24 hours of anaerobic incubation on 5% sheep blood
agar. Colonies are resuspended in saline to a turbidity of 0.5 McFarland (~1.5 X 107
CFU/mL) and diluted with saline to obtain a suspension of ~106 CFU/mL. A dry swab is
dipped into the bacterial suspension, and excess fluid is pressed out. It is then processed
and tested as a clinical specimen, including controls. All specimens and controls should
yield valid results (no invalid positive or negative control; no failed internal control; and
no incorrect specimen processing control results – when specimen processing controls are
performed). In the event of an incorrect specimen processing control result, it is
recommended that a new aliquot be obtained from the original stool specimen, and that
this specimen be retested along with new controls before reporting results.
