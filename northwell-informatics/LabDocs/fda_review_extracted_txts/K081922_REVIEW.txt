L. Test Principle:
The AutoDELFIA Neonatal 17α-OH-progesterone (17-OHP) assay is a solid phase,
time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay based on the competitive reaction between
europium-labeled 17-OHP and sample 17-OHP for a limited amount of binding sites
on 17-OHP specific polyclonal antibodies (derived from rabbit). Danazol facilitates
the release of 17-OHP from the binding proteins. A second antibody, directed against
rabbit IgG, is coated to the solid phase, giving convenient separation of the antibody-
bound and free antigen.
Enhancement Solution dissociates europium ions from the labeled antigen into
solution where they form highly fluorescent chelates with components of the
Enhancement Solution. The fluorescence in each well is then measured. The
fluorescence of each sample is inversely proportional to the concentration of 17-OHP
in the sample.
The test instructions indicate that there are two different options for calibrating the
assay: 1) a calibration curve in duplicate for every batch of up to 4 plates or 2) a full
calibration curve in duplicate for each plate.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the AutoDELFIA 17-OHP kit was evaluated in the following
manner. Seven whole blood specimens were obtained from adults and spiked
with 17-OHP at concentrations across the reportable range of the test. The
samples were then dispensed onto filter paper and dried at room temperature
overnight. The samples were tested over 21 days using three lots of
AutoDELFIA kits and three analyzers, for a total of n=216 measurements.
The results are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The study was performed following the CLSI protocol EP6-A. Whole blood
was obtained from six apparently healthy adults. Specimens with low 17-OHP
concentration were pooled. A part of the specimen was pooled and spiked to
create a sample with high 17-OHP concentration (approximately 250 ng/mL).
The high and low pools were mixed in varying proportions to create a dilution
series of varying 17-OHP concentrations. Each test sample was spotted on

filter paper in quadruplicate (n=4) and dried overnight. The 17-OHP
concentrations of the series of dried blood spot samples were measured with
one AutoDELFIA 17-OHP kit lot in a single run in random order.
The data was analyzed using linear regression as well as second and third
order non-linear fitted polynomial regression. The third order model fit the
data better than the linear model. However, for dilution points greater than 4
ng/mL, the maximum observed difference (%) between the models was 7 %.
For concentrations ≤ 4 ng/mL, the observed absolute difference between the
models was 0.19 ng/mL. The results are summarized below:

The value of the highest kit calibrator may vary slightly but does not exceed
220 ng/mL. The package insert states that samples with values above the
highest calibrator are not considered accurate but are highly indicative of
CAH. The reportable range is from 1.4 to 220 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no international reference preparation or reference method for 17-
OHP. The AutoDELFIA Neonatal 17-OHP kits are traceable to commercially
available purified 17-OHP.
Six calibrators and three controls are supplied with the kit as dried blood spots
on Whatman 903 filter paper. They are prepared from human blood with a
hematocrit value of 50-55% and purified 17-OHP. They are calibrated using
gravimetric methods.

Real-time stability including shelf-life, transport, and in-use stability studies
for the entire kit were performed, including the controls and calibrators.
Additionally, accelerated stability studies were also performed separately for
the kit calibrators and controls. The study protocols and statistically calculated
acceptance limits were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor states that the Limit of Blank (LoB) study was performed in
accordance with the recommendations of CLSI document EP-17. The LoB
was calculated from data using three kit lots over six testing days and a total
of 108 measurements of blank (analyte free) dried blood spot samples on filter
paper. Calibrators and controls were tested in quadruplicate and duplicate
respectively for each assay. Since the assay does not report values less than
zero, the LoB was estimated non-parametrically, as CLSI EP-17 advises, as
the 95th percentile of the measurements. The limit of blank was observed to
be 0.37 ng/mL.
To estimate the Limit of Detection (LoD) and the Limit of Quantitation
(LoQ), five low level samples (dried blood spot samples on filter paper) were
prepared from heparinized whole blood. These samples were analyzed using
the predicate method. Repeated measurements (n = 108) were carried out
using the proposed device with each sample. Statistical analysis yielded a
limit of detection of 0.84 ng/mL and a limit of quantitation of 1.4 ng/mL.
The package insert states that values below 1.4 ng/mL should be reported as
“<1.4 ng/mL.”
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference from various compounds was evaluated at 17-OHP
concentrations of approximately 25 and 70 ng/mL. The potential interferant
was added to whole blood specimens containing 17-OHP, spotted onto filter
paper, dried, and tested. Specimens without added interferant were also tested
(control). The sponsor used a two sample t-test at the 95% confidence interval
to evaluate the significance of any difference seen between test and control
samples.

hemoglobin and triglycerides (Intralipid) at the tested levels did not interfere
with the assay.

2) by measuring the 17-OHP concentration in a total of 2175 and 1826 infants
(study 1 and study 2, respectively). The specimens were routine and
retrospective CAH-screen negative specimens. The results were analyzed and
classified according to the birth weights of the infants. The results are
summarized in the tables below:
Note: According to the sponsor, the measurements obtained with the
proposed device are lower than those obtained with the predicate device
because the revised kit contains a more specific polyclonal anti-17-OHP
antiserum which demonstrates lower cross-reactivity and less non-specific
binding.

Using the data from non-CAH samples, the cut-offs were determined by
calculating the 17-OHP concentrations corresponding to the 90th and 95th
population percentiles in both studies. The results for the screening
performance of the proposed device including retrospective CAH diagnosed
screening specimens are summarized in the tables below:

was taken during the first day of life, the mother’s treatment would have

* Using percentiles higher than the 90th percentile as the assay’s cut-off
resulted in one false negative result out of the 13 clinically confirmed
CAH samples assayed. Laboratories should take this into consideration
when setting their screening cut-offs.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. The device should only be used with neonatal whole blood
from heel prick.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
According to the sponsor, the measurements obtained with the proposed device
are lower than those obtained with the predicate device because the revised kit
contains a more specific polyclonal anti-17-OHP antiserum which demonstrates
lower cross-reactivity and less non-specific binding.
The package insert includes precautionary language that each laboratory should
establish their own reference range and cut-off values and that cut-offs from
another 17-OHP screening test should not be used.
The package insert also includes the following precautionary language “Using
percentiles higher than the 90th percentile as the assay’s cut-off resulted in one
false negative result out of the 13 clinically confirmed CAH samples assayed.
Laboratories should take this into consideration when setting their screening cut-
offs”.
