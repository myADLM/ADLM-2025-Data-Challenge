H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc. device, D3 Duet DFA RSV/Respiratory Virus
Screening Kit, is intended for the qualitative detection and identification of
respiratory syncytial virus, while screening for influenza A virus, influenza B
virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3 viral antigens, in nasal
and nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates or in cell culture. The assay detects viral
antigens by immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), from
patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection
It is recommended that specimens found to be negative after examination of the
direct specimen result be confirmed by cell culture. Negative results do not
preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for
diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A virus detection and identification
were established when influenza A (H3N2) and influenza A (H1N1) were the
predominant influenza A strains circulating in the United States. When other
influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary. If
infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities,
specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for
novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to a state or local health department for
testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+
facility is available to receive and culture specimens.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Fluorescence microscope with the correct filter combination for FITC (excitation
peak = 490 nm, emission peak = 520nm) and R-phycoerythrin (R-PE),
magnification 200 to 400X
I. Device Description:
The Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc. device, D3 Duet DFA RSV/Respiratory Virus
Screening Kit, uses a blend of viral antigen-specific murine MAbs. MAbs for
RSV are directly labeled with R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) for the rapid detection and
identification of RSV. MAbs for influenza A virus, influenza B virus, adenovirus,
and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3 are directly labeled with fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC), for rapid detection of these agents.

L. Test Principle:
The test kit uses viral antigen-specific murine monoclonal antibodies that are directly
labeled with either fluorescein or R-phycoerythrin for rapid detection of respiratory
viruses and identification of Influenza A. The cells to be tested, derived from a
clinical specimen or cell culture, are placed onto a glass slide, allowed to air dry, and
fixed in acetone. After addition of the D3 Duet DFA RSV/Respiratory Virus
Screening Reagent and incubation at 35° to 37°C the stained cells are washed with
the diluted wash solution, a drop of the supplied Mounting Fluid is added and a
coverslip is placed on the prepared cells. The cells are examined using a fluorescence
microscope. The RSV virus infected cells will fluoresce golden-yellow, while cells
infected with any of the other six viruses will fluoresce apple-green. Uninfected cells
will contain no fluorescence but will be stained red by the Evans Blue counter-stain.
If only golden-yellow fluorescent cells are present the specimen can be reported as
positive for RSV antigen. If only apple-green fluorescent cells are present, the
particular virus may be identified using an FDA approved assay such as the
individual reagents from the D3 Ultra™ DFA Respiratory Virus Screening & ID Kit
(D3 Ultra) on new, separate cell preparations. If both golden-yellow and apple-green
are present, the additional virus may be identified using an FDA approved assay such
as the individual reagents from the D3 Ultra on new, separate cell preparations.
It is recommended that results for specimens found to contain no fluorescent cells
after examination of the direct specimen result be confirmed by cell culture.
Interpretation of results:
It is recommended that controls be examined first to ensure proper test performance
before examination of the specimens. The entire cell spot or monolayer of cells
should be examined before reporting final results. Patient sample results should not
be reported unless controls perform as expected.
Uninfected cells will fluoresce dull red due to the Evans Blue counter-stain included
in the DFA Reagent.
Fluorescent staining pattern of respiratory virus infected cells:
• RSV: A positive reaction is one in which golden-yellow fluorescence is observed
in the cytoplasm, nucleus or in both. Cytoplasmic staining is often punctuated
with small inclusions in the syncytia.
• Other respiratory viruses: Green fluorescence observed in the cytoplasm and/or
nucleus is suggestive of infection with a respiratory virus other than respiratory
syncytial virus. (Further identification may be achieved with the D3 Ultra Kit).
The staining patterns described below are for reference only; identification of the
viral antigens present in the apple-green fluorescent cells must be performed
using another FDA cleared device:
a) Influenza A virus: The fluorescence is cytoplasmic, nuclear or both.
Cytoplasmic staining is often punctate with large inclusions while nuclear
staining is uniformly bright.
b) Influenza B virus: The fluorescence is cytoplasmic, nuclear or both.
Cytoplasmic staining is often punctate with large inclusions while nuclear
5

--- Page 6 ---
staining is uniformly bright.
c) Adenovirus: The fluorescence is cytoplasmic and punctate or bright nuclear
or both.
d) Parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3: The fluorescence is cytoplasmic and
punctate with irregular inclusions. Types 2 and 3 cause the formation of
syncytia.
• Co-infection with respiratory syncytial virus and other viruses has been reported
in a number of studies. The presence of multiple viruses is indicated when a
stained slide well exhibits both golden-yellow and apple-green fluorescent cells.
Results of direct specimen testing: The quality of the specimen with respect to the
number of epithelial cells in the sample can be assessed by examining the different
fields at a magnification of 200X. A satisfactory specimen should have at least 2
columnar epithelial cells per field. A negative result is indicated by the absence of
fluorescence in a minimal sampling of 20 columnar epithelial cells. An inadequate
sample is indicated by fewer than 20 columnar epithelial cells present in the sample,
in which case the test is considered invalid. A new specimen should be obtained and
tested or cell culture of the remaining specimen should be initiated.
A satisfactory specimen with no fluorescent cells observed should be reported as “No
respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A, influenza B, adenovirus, parainfluenza type
1, parainfluenza type 2, or parainfluenza type 3 viral antigens detected by direct
specimen testing”.
If golden-yellow fluorescent cells are found, it should be reported as “Respiratory
syncytial virus antigens detected by direct specimen testing.”
If only apple-green fluorescent cells are found, the identification of the virus(es),
other than respiratory syncytial virus may be based on the follow-up assay (e.g. D3
Ultra DFA Kit). In such cases, identification and reporting of the apple-green
fluorescing viral antigen(s) should be performed according the respective device’s
instructions.
If co-infection of respiratory syncytial virus and one of the other respiratory viruses is
detected (exhibited by both golden-yellow and apple-green fluorescent cells present)
the identification of the virus(es), other than respiratory syncytial virus, may be based
on the follow-up assay, such as D3 Ultra DFA Kit (not provided). In such cases, it
should be reported as “respiratory syncytial virus and identification and reporting of
the apple-green fluorescing viral antigen(s) should be performed according the
respective device’s instructions.
Results from Culture Isolation / Confirmation: The entire cell spot or monolayer of
cells must be examined for virus-infected, fluorescent cells. If no fluorescent cells
are found, the results of testing of the specimen should be reported as, “No
Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Influenza A, Influenza B, Adenovirus, Parainfluenza 1,
Parainfluenza 2, or Parainfluenza 3 isolated by cell culture.”
If golden-yellow fluorescent cells are found, it should be reported as “Respiratory
syncytial virus isolated in cell culture”.
If only apple-green fluorescing cells are found, the identification of the virus(es),
other than respiratory syncytial virus may be based on the follow-up assay (such as
6

--- Page 7 ---
D3 Ultra DFA Kit). In such cases, identification and reporting of the apple-green
fluorescing viral antigen(s) should be performed according the respective device’s
instructions.
If co-infection of respiratory syncytial virus and one of the other respiratory viruses is
detected (exhibited by both golden-yellow and apple-green fluorescent cells present)
the identification of the virus(es), other than respiratory syncytial virus, may be based
on the follow-up assay, such as D3 Ultra DFA Kit (not provided). In such cases, it
should be reported as “Respiratory syncytial virus and identification and reporting of
the apple-green fluorescing viral antigen(s) should be performed according the
respective device’s instructions.”
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Assay precision, intra-assay variability and inter assay variability were
assessed with a panel of proficiency-level antigen control slides. The panel
consisted of slides spotted with cell preparations of the following:
1. Low level RSV (Washington strain)
2. Mid level RSV (Washington strain)
3. Low level influenza A (Victoria strain) mixed with Mid level RSV
(Washington strain)
4. Mid level influenza A (Victoria strain) mixed with Low level RSV
(Washington strain)
5. Low level respiratory virus (either influenza virus B {Taiwan strain},
adenovirus type 1, Parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, or 3 (strains C35, Greer,
C243 respectively). This panel member was rotated during the 5-days of
testing so that each virus is tested twice.
6. Negative – no infected cells present
The low level is estimated to contain between 4 to 10% infected cells per cell
spot. The mid level is estimated to contain between 20 to 25% infected cells
per cell spot. Both levels were below the level used in quality control slides.
Each panel member was re-coded daily to prevent its identification. Each
panel was stained twice per day for 5-days by three different laboratories.
The following results were recorded for both the control slide and the panel
slide:
1. Presence or absence of Yellow-gold fluorescence.
2. Percent of cells exhibiting Yellow-gold fluorescence
3. Presence or absence of Green fluorescence
4. Percent of cells exhibiting Green fluorescence
The combined data for negative specimens – no infected cells present - from
the three sites demonstrates that the R-PE labeled and FITC labeled MAbs
reproducibly do not stain uninfected cells. No fluorescent cells were seen in
100% (60/60) of the wells lacking infected cells.

The combined data from the three sites demonstrates reproducible detection of
respiratory syncytial virus by the R-PE labeled MAbs. The presence of
respiratory syncytial virus infected cells was reported in 98% (147/150) of the
wells in which the infected cells were expected:

does not interfere with the detection of influenza A virus by the FITC labeled
MAbs in a reproducible manner. The presence of influenza A virus infected
cells was reported in 94.7% (54/57) of the wells in which the R-PE stained

Cross-Reactivity Testing
The D3 Duet RSV/Respiratory Virus Screening Kit was tested for cross-
reactivity against a variety of cells and microorganisms. Stringent conditions
for cross-reactivity testing were achieved by using a high concentration of the
D3 Duet DFA Influenza RSV/Respiratory Virus Screening Reagent and
relatively high titers of microorganisms. The D3 Duet DFA RSV/Respiratory
Virus Screening Reagent was prepared at 1.5X the concentration that is
provided in the kit. No cross-reactivity was observed for 32 virus strains or
for 17 host culture cell types. Twenty-five bacterial strains, one yeast, three
Chlamydia sp. and one protozoan were evaluated for cross-reactivity,

Thirty microorganisms, including 25 bacterial and one yeast cultures, three
Chlamydia sp. and one protozoan commercially available slides, were stained
with the 1.5X DFA Reagent according to the procedure as detailed in the
product insert, then examined for cross reactivity. Except for Staphylococcus
aureus, which was cross reactive with the D3 Duet DFA Influenza
A/Respiratory Virus Screening Reagent, all other microorganisms tested
negative. Reactivity with Staphylococcus aureus is more than likely due to
binding the protein A produced by Staphylococcus aureus. Concentrations for
each bacterial organism cultured by DHI for cross reactivity testing were
determined from suspensions of the bacteria in PBS by spectrophotometer
according to McFarland standards of levels 1.0 and 2.0 (equaling
approximately 3.0 x 106 and 6.0 x 106 CFU per mL). Slides were prepared
with spots of 0.01-mL of the suspensions to give either 3.0 x 104 or 6.0 x 104
per spot. At the same time, 1-mL of each suspension was plated on an
appropriate agar dish for colony confirmation. According to the confirmation
agar cultures, initial concentrations of the bacterial organisms in the study
ranged from 6.4 x 104 to 2.9 x 107 CFU. Microorganisms tested are listed

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Direct fresh specimens:
A study was performed prospectively at three sites with 1203 fresh specimens
that were received for respiratory virus testing. Each specimen was evaluated
by the D3 Duet DFA Influenza A/Respiratory Virus Screening Kit and a
cleared DSFA device for the presence of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza
A, influenza B, adenovirus, parainfluenza 1, parainfluenza 2 and
parainfluenza 3 in cells derived from clinical specimens. Seventeen
specimens were excluded from analysis due to a variety of reasons (site
deviations, duplicate specimen, insufficient cell numbers, or high
background). These exclusions left 1187 specimen results for analysis.
The following tables detail the summary of the comparison of the D3 Duet and
the cleared DSFA comparator assay, combined for study sites 1, 2, and 3:

Cultured specimens:
To evaluate the performance of this device using cultured clinical specimens,
a fourth study was performed with 298 frozen specimens to compare
performance of the D3 Duet DFA RSV/Respiratory Virus Screening Kit with
that of the predicate for the presence of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza
A virus, influenza B virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3
from cultured clinical specimens. At Study Site 4, 298 frozen specimens were
processed for cell culture testing in accordance with the procedure in the
Comparator product insert (same procedure for both Subject and Comparator
devices) using R-Mix Too™ FreshCells™ in 48/24-fill multi-well plates. All
specimens at study site 4 were derived from nasopharyngeal specimens. The

A variety of viral respiratory pathogens were isolated. Virus identification of
D3 Duet FITC Positive Specimens using D3 Ultra Identification Reagents
yielded the following isolates: respiratory syncytial virus [prevalence 11.1%
(33/298)], influenza A virus [prevalence 22.5% (67/298)], influenza B virus
[prevalence 6.7% (20/298)], adenovirus [prevalence 3.4% (10/298)],
parainfluenza type 1 virus [prevalence 1.7% (5/298)], parainfluenza type 2
virus [prevalence 1.0% (3/298)], and parainfluenza type 3 virus [prevalence
3.0% (9/298)]. There were sixteen co-infections as follows: three influenza A
virus + parainfluenza type 3 virus, one influenza A virus + parainfluenza type
1 virus, one influenza A virus + parainfluenza type 2 virus, two influenza A
virus + respiratory syncytial virus, one influenza A virus + adenovirus, one
influenza B virus + parainfluenza type 2 virus, one influenza B virus +
parainfluenza type 3 virus, one influenza B virus + respiratory syncytial virus,
one respiratory syncytial virus + parainfluenza type 1 virus, two respiratory
syncytial virus + parainfluenza type 3 virus, one adenovirus + parainfluenza
type 1 virus and one adenovirus + parainfluenza type 3 virus.

A study was performed prospectively at three sites with 1187 fresh specimens that
were received for respiratory virus testing. Each specimen was evaluated for the
presence of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A, influenza B, adenovirus,
parainfluenza 1, parainfluenza 2 and parainfluenza 3 in cells derived from clinical
specimens. Prevalence of the respiratory viruses within this population during the
2006/2007 season is noted in the table below:
