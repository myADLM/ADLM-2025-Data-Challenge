K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Premarket Notifications for Automated
Differential Cell Counters for Immature or Abnormal Blood Cells; Final Guidance for
Industry and FDA
L. Test Principle:
CBC analysis is based on the established Coulter Principle and Hemoglobinometry. The
Coulter method counts and sizes cells by detecting and measuring changes in electrical
resistance, when a cell suspended in a conductive liquid passes through a small aperture. The
system counts the individual cells and provides cell size distribution. Hemoglobin is
measured photometrically at 525 nm.
The DxH 800 housed a flow cell in a Multi Transducer Module which produced three
measurement signals: volume, conductivity, and light scatter. Differential, NRBC, and
Reticulocyte analysis is based on the VCSn technology using Aperture Impedance,
Conductivity, Laser Light Scatter (multiple angles). In the flow cell, a direct current
measures cell volume, high-frequency current senses cellular content, light scatter
characterizes the size and refractivity of the cells.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Whole blood sample age and storage: Two sets of specimens from donors were
collected. For each specimen tested, a set of sample tubes was stored at controlled room
temperature (18-26º C) and another set was stored refrigerated (2-8º C).
Room temperature samples were analyzed at t = 1.5, 8, 16, 24, and 32 hours.
Refrigerated samples were analyzed at t = 1.5, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 56, 64, and 72 hours.
Reticulocyte parameter was analyzed up to 72 hours, NRBC parameter to 24 hours, using
t=1.5 room temperature as reference. WBC differential flagging ability was evaluated on
the specimens up to 32 hours at room temperature and 72 hours refrigerated.

--- Page 8 ---
Donor samples are stable up to:
• 24 hours at room temperature and 48 hours at refrigerated temperature for WBC,
RBC, HGB, MCV, RDW%, RDW-SD, PLT, MPV, NE%, LY%, MO%, EO%, BA%
• 24 hours at room temperature and refrigerated temperature for NRBC%
• 24 hours at room temperature and 72 hours at refrigerated temperature for RET%,
MRVfL, and IRF
2. Sample stability on pre-dilute whole blood: Specimens collected from donors were
stored at controlled room temperature (18-26º C) and tested at t = 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60
minutes after dilution to verify pre-diluted sample stability. The pre-dilute samples are
stable up to one hour as specified in the Instructions for Use.

recommends that the body fluid samples should be stored at room temperature and
analyzed within one hour of collection.
4. Carryover study:
a. Whole blood CBC (WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT), Diff, and Retic: carryover was
determined by analyzing three normal whole blood samples, followed by 3 diluent
samples.
b. Body Fluid: carryover was evaluated by analysis of a normal blood followed by a
diluent sample analyzed as a body fluid. Carryover is assessed by achieving
background count on the diluent.
The results for whole blood and body fluid met the acceptance criteria as stated in the
specification in the Instructions for Use.
