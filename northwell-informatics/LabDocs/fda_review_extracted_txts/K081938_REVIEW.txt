K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI Guidance EP5-A2: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative
Measurement Methods
L. Test Principle:
The enzyme, acyl amidohydrolase, cleaves the amide bond of the acetaminophen
molecule, leaving p-aminophenol and acetate. The p-aminophenol is coupled with
2,5-dimethylphenol in the presence of manganese ions to form a colored compound,
4-(4-iminophenol)-2,5-dimethylcyclohexadiene-1-one. The increased absorbance due
to the formation of 4-(4-iminophenol)-2,5-dimethylcylcohexadiene-1-one is directly
proportional to the acetaminophen in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Total precision studies were performed on the Hitachi 717 in accordance
CLSI guidance document EP5-A2. A total of 40 runs were performed on 20
different days. Each run consisted of 3 concentrations of serum controls each
run in duplicate. Controls were run on the same instrument twice a day by
one operator in Genzyme Diagnostics P.E.I. Inc. laboratories. Within run
precision testing was performed by testing three serum controls 20 times each
in one run. The results are summarized below.

An additional precision study consisting of a total of 40 runs on 10 different
days was performed. Each run consisted of 2 concentrations of serum
controls run in duplicate. Within run and total precision were calculated and
are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated on the Hitachi 717 by testing a spiked serum set that
consisted of 11 concentrations of acetaminophen across the assay range. Each
sample was tested four times and linearity was calculated. All samples tested
were within ±3.9% of the expected value and the linear regression calculations
resulted in a slope of 0.993 and an intercept of 1.6 µmol/L. These results
support the manufacture’s claimed measurement range of 4-2500 umol/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrator was previously cleared under k952949.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was evaluated on the Hitachi 717 by
performing serial dilutions of a commercial control, then testing each dilution
n=40 over 5 days. The sponsor defined the LoQ as the lowest concentration at
which the CV% did not exceed 20%. The LoQ was calculated as 4 µmol/L,
supporting the claimed lower limit of the assay.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interferences from hemolysis, icterus, lipemia, ascorbic acid, and N-
acetylcysteine were evaluated on the Hitachi 717 by testing three
concentrations of acetaminophen with multiple concentrations of each
interferent. Significant interference was defined by the manufacturer as >
10% or ±8 µmol/L variance from control, whichever is greater. The highest
concentrations of each substance that did not show significant interference
with each acetaminophen concentration tested are shown below.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed on the Hitachi 717 by testing 88
patient samples in singlicate on the Acetaminophen L3K Assay and a
previously cleared predicate device. The samples ranged in concentration
from 38 to 2361 µmol/L. Linear regression was performed and resulted in a
slope of 1.063 (95% confidence interval 1.058 to 1.068), a y-intercept of 7.0
µmol/L (95% confidence interval 3.2 to 11.2), and a correlation coefficient of
0.9998.
b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was performed on the Hitachi 717 by testing 25
sets of matched serum and lithium heparin plasma samples with
acetaminophen concentrations that spanned the full measuring range of the
device. Linear regression analysis was performed and resulted in the
following equation. y = 0.999x – 2.2. The correlation coefficient was 0.9999.
