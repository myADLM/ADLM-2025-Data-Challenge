L. Test Principle:
The ENVISION Blood Glucose Test System is based on the measurement of glucose
concentration in human blood. The principle of the test is based on the reaction between
glucose in blood sample, glucose oxidase and potassium ferricyanide. The resulting product
generates a current that is proportional to the glucose concentration in the sample. The test
strip employs an electrochemical signal generating an electrical current that will stimulate a
chemical reaction. The reaction is measured and displayed by the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within- in precision was measured with EDTA anti-coagulated venous blood samples
at five different glucose concentrations. Five hundred test strips from 10 vials from a
single lot were tested with 10 meters. Ten measurements for five samples (n=50)
were recorded and the results are shown in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
EDTA venous blood sample was spiked to form two concentrations (high and low).
The two concentrations were mixed to form 14 glucose concentrations between 20.4
to 595.8 mg/dL (confirmed by YSI) then tested with the ENVISION Blood Glucose
Meter and YSI. The meter displays “ Low” with glucose values below 20 mg/dL, “Hi” with
glucose values over 600 mg/dL. Each glucose level was measured 5 times by the
ENVISION Meter and in duplicate by YSI. Regression analysis showed a linear
relationship between the ENVISION Meter and the YSI method: y=0.998x – 0.880,
R2=1.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The glucose control standards are traceable to a NIST glucose standard and were
previously cleared in submission k051285. The reference instrument used is the YSI
2300 Glucose analyzer and is calibrated by YSI 2747 Glucose Standard which is a
NIST traceable glucose standard. The controls are prepared at three target
concentrations gravimetrically and the glucose concentrations are verified with the
YSI reference method. The expected values are verified for each new lot of strips.
Shelf-life studies show that the unopened test strips have a 26 month life-span and 3
months shelf-life once a vial of strips is opened. Unopened controls have a 26 month
shelf life and are stable for 3 months after first use.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor has not conducted studies to determine the limit of detection (LOD).
However, the lower limit is supported by linearity studies. The sponsor has
established the measuring range of 20 – 600 mg/dL for ENVISION Blood Glucose
Test System.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor evaluated the effects of hematocrit on whole blood samples spiked with
4 to 5 hematocrit levels (between 20 -60%) at eight glucose concentrations between
45 to 559 mg. These values were compared to values from an YSI-2300 analyzer.
The results indicated that bias introduced at hematocrit levels between 20% to 60%
was within +/-15 mg/dL for values under 75 mg/dL and +/-10% for values 75 mg/dL
and over.

A temperature study was conducted with three control solutions kept at room
temperature. Five meters and strips were set to three different temperatures between
10 and 40°C. A humidity study was conducted with three glucose levels run at three
humidity percentages. The results from both studies showed that the device can be
used from 10 to 40°C and from 10 to 90% relative humidity.
The sponsor conducted an altitude study to evaluate the effects of decreased oxygen
pressure resulting from high altitudes may have on the device. An altitude study was
performed with venous blood samples from volunteers. Glucose values of adjusting pO
2
venous bloods (ranging from 32 mg/dL to 551 mg/dL) were measured by ENVISIONTM in
the altitude chamber at sea level and 10,000 feet conditions. Glucose values of plasma
centrifuged from venous whole blood were measured by YSI 2300 as the reference value.
Linear regression results of the Envision versus the YSI results at 10000 feet revealed a line
of y= 0.9949 -1.09 and a correlation coefficient of 0.9990. The test data using the samples
from both meters (sea-level and 10000 feet) showed that the bias versus YSI at
10,000 feet is the same bias versus YSI as that observed at sea level. These data
indicate no additional effect due to altitude up to10,000 feet. The results indicate that
the device is unaffected by altitudes up to 10,000 feet.
Common interferences were evaluated by spiking venous blood with glucose to three
concentrations based on EP7-P of low (less that 75 mg/dL) normal (160 mg/dL) and
high (greater than 240 mg/dL) ). Middle concentrations were prepared gravimetrically
from the two initial concentrations to form 5 total concentrations. The glucose
samples were spiked with the interferents and run in replicates of 5. The sponsor’s
acceptance criterion was +/-15% bias. There was no interference effects observed up
to the high test levels show in the table below. The error% of uric acid, Dopamine and
Gentistic acid was over ± 15 %, failing the criteria. Thus, uric acid, Dopamine and Gentistic
acid were included as an interference in the strip user manual. The three interferences studies
are shown in the three tables below.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
System accuracy was evaluated by comparing the fingertip results of 160 samples that
spanned the claimed assay range to the results obtained by a Hitachi 747. Samples
ranged from 30 to 507 mg/dL and were run on two different meters. . For some of the
samples that were less than 50 mg/dL and greater than 400 mg/dL, pooled anti-
coagulated capillary whole blood specimens were allowed to hydrolyze or were
spiked to the desired glucose levels. Regression analysis of results from both meters
is shown below:

Lay user studies:
The sponsor conducted a study at three clinical sties (50 users per site) to compare the
accuracy of glucose measurement between the lay-user and the healthcare
professionals. At each clinical site, the lay-user performed a fingerstick, tested their
blood with the ENVISION meter and recorded their results. A healthcare
professional then obtained a capillary blood sample and a venous sample to obtain
results with the same ENVISION meter and the Hitachi 747. The lay user then
completed a questionnaire to cover demographics and ease of use and understanding.
Regression analysis of the participants’ fingerstick value (ranged from 59-540 mg/dL)
against a laboratory method (Hitachi 747) yielded the following results: y=1.00224x-

The sponsor assessed readability of the labeling by the previously recruited 150 lay
users who were provided with the ENVISION test kit. Participants varied in age,
education, country of origin and gender. The overall survey indicated that 88% of the
participants found the labeling easy to use and understand. The readability for the
user manual, strip manual and control solution labeling are grades 6.5, 7.0 and 5.5,
respectively.

Alternate Site Studies (AST):
The sponsor conducted alternative site testing (AST) using the ventral palm, the
dorsal hand, the forearm, the upper arm, the calf, and the thigh and compared the
results to concurrent fingerstick readings. Lay-users vigorously rubbed the
alternative site for 5-10 seconds (until they felt warming) before obtaining the
sample. Regression results are shown below and the percentage of results meeting
ISO 15197 acceptance criteria for accuracy.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The normal fasting adult glucose range for a non-diabetic is 70-105 mg/dL. One to two
hours after a meal, normal blood glucose levels should be less than 140 mg/dL. A
medical professional should determine the range that is appropriate for diabetes
patients.1,2

N. Instrument Name:
ENVISION™ Blood Glucose Test System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ______
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, ventral
palm, the dorsal hand, the forearm, the upper arm, the calf, and the thigh. Since the
whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no special handling or
storage issues.
15

--- Page 16 ---
5. Calibration:
Strip lot-specific calibration is accomplished by embedding a Calibration Code onto each
Envision test strip, which then provides the Calibration Code information to the Envision
meter when the strip is inserted.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor has three levels of controls available for this meter with both levels coming
with the kit and also being available through the distributor. When a test strip is inserted
into the meter, a control can be run. An acceptable range for each control level is printed
on the test strip vial label. The user is referred to a troubleshooting section at the end of
the control test instructions of the owner’s manual to identify possible reasons control
results fall outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
None
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
