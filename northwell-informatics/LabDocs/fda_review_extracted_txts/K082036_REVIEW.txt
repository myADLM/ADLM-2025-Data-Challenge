c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: there are no claims made for traceability.
Stability:
An accelerated stability study suggested that lyophilized (unreconstituted)
vials stored under recommended conditions were stable for 3 years. Real time
stability studies demonstrated that lyophilized vials were stable for a
minimum of 12 months.
Reconstituted vial stability stored at 2°C to 8°C: All analytes are stable for 14
days with the following exceptions:
Carcinoembyonic Antigen (CEA) is stable for 11 days

ACTH and calcitonin.
Expected values:
Value assignments for each lot are performed by independent manufacturers
and laboratories using FDA-exempt, cleared, or approved tests. Mean values
for the three levels are derived from repeated analysis of each analyte. It is
recommended that each laboratory establish its own values and acceptable
range. Values and ranges are lot specific.
