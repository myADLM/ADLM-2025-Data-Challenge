I. Device Description:
The method for qualitative determination of anti-HAV is a competitive sandwich
chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) based on neutralization. The assay uses
magnetic particles (solid phase) coated with IgG antibodies to HAV (mouse monoclonal),
and a mouse monoclonal anti- HAV antibody conjugate linked to an isoluminol
derivative (isoluminol-antibody conjugate).
2

--- Page 3 ---
The first incubation step consists of adding the HAV antigen to calibrators, samples or
controls, during which anti-HAV present in calibrators, samples or controls binds to a
fixed and limited amount of HAV, thus forming an HAV-anti-HAV immune complex.
After this step the second incubation follows and it involves addition of magnetic
microparticles and conjugate into the reaction module, during which the antibody
conjugate and the solid-phase antibody compete with anti-HAV present in the specimen
for HAV, that allows the conjugate to bind to the solid phase and thus formation of a
sandwich. If all HAV added is sequestered in an HAV-anti-HAV immune complex
during the first incubation, no sandwich is formed during the second incubation. After the
second incubation, the unbound material is removed with a wash cycle.
Subsequently, the starter reagents are added and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is
thus induced. The light signal, and hence the amount of isoluminol-antibody conjugate, is
measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is inversely indicative of
anti-HAV present in calibrators, samples or controls.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A five-day reproducibility/precision study was conducted at three external
laboratories. A panel comprised of 12 frozen coded samples prepared by
spiking positive serum samples into negative serum samples to achieve high
negative, low positive and high positive results, was prepared by DiaSorin
S.p.A. and provided to the sites. The two negative panel samples were not
spiked. The LIAISON® Control Anti-HAV set was also included in the five-
day study. The coded panel was tested at all three sites, using four replicates
per run in one run per day for five operating days. The mean Index value,
standard deviation, and coefficient of variation (%CV) of the results were
computed for each of the tested specimens for each of the sites:

The DiaSorin LIAISON® Anti-HAV immunoassay uses two controls
contained in the LIAISON® Control Anti-HAV kit at different reactivities of
anti-HAV. The Negative Control is intended to provide an assay response
characteristic of negative patient specimens (targeted range >1.75 Index). The
Positive Control is intended to provide an assay response characteristic of
positive patient specimens (targeted range 0.07-0.70 Index). The Positive
Control is prepared by diluting human serum/defibrinated plasma at high level
of anti-HAV with fetal calf serum, while the Negative Control consists of
human serum/defibrinated plasma not reactive for anti-HAV. The Controls are
tested for release with approved Reagent Integral lots to determine their Index.
If necessary, the potency of the Positive Control may be adjusted until the test
results fall within the target range. When the expected Index is obtained, the
Positive Control is filled into vials and tested again on an approved Reagent
Integral lot to assess the final Index.
Calibration:
DiaSorin's LIAISON® Anti-HAV assay generates a continuous response
(relative light units, RLU) which is used in sample grading to provide a
qualitative (positive, negative, or equivocal) reportable result. The sample
grading is based on the use of a calibration curve referenced to an in-house
HAV antibody preparation and controlled by the use of two calibrators
(Calibrator 1 and Calibrator 2) provided in the Reagent Integral. The
calibrators are assayed by the user to transform the kit lot specific Master
Curve into a Working Curve. The Master Curves are stored on the LIAISON®
Analyzer and specifically matched to the kit in use via the instructions
encoded in the bar codes printed on the Reagent Integral label. Each Master
Curve is generated by a mathematical elaboration of the data resulting from
multiple testing (at least 10 runs) of an internal Reference Calibration Curve.
During user calibration, the Calibrator results are used to create a Working
Curve by mathematical adjustment of the Master Curve. The Working Curve
is then used to calculate sample results. The analyzer is calibrated in triplicate
whenever one of the following conditions occurs (see LIAISON® Analyzer
Operator’s manual):
– A new lot of Reagent Integral or a new lot of Starter Kit is used.
– The previous calibration was performed more than two weeks before.
– The analyzer has been serviced.
– Control values lie outside the expected ranges.
Calibrator 1 is calibrated at 0.16-0.39 Index units and Calibrator 2 at 2.0-4.0
Index units. Calibrator 1 is manufactured by diluting human positive anti-
HAV serum/defibrinated plasma with fetal calf serum to obtain the target
Index. Calibrator 2 consists of human serum/defibrinated plasma negative for
anti-HAV. The lot-specific Index values of the Calibrators are encoded on bar
codes printed on the Reagent Integral label. The process by which assay
6

--- Page 7 ---
calibration is established and maintained is comprised of the following steps:
• Creation of an ‘In-house’ Reference Preparation during the development
phase. This step involves the selection of appropriate serum/defibrinated
plasma and assignment of an arbitrary Index value. The final material is
dispensed in aliquots and stored frozen. It is used as anti-HAV Standard
Curve for calibration of Reagent Integral lots.
• Prior to depletion of the current Reference Preparation, a new Reference
Preparation is prepared by the selection of appropriate serum/defibrinated
plasma material, serial dilution with human negative serum/defibrinated
plasma, and assignment of Index values to the obtained points by calibration
against the current Reference Preparation.
d. Detection limit:
Not Applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
The analytical specificity of the LIAISON® Anti-HAV assay was evaluated
using 346 samples. The samples were confirmed positive for the following
potential cross reacting agents: viruses that may cause symptoms similar to
HAV infection (EBV, CMV, Rubella, Measles, Mumps, HBV, HCV), other
organisms that may cause infectious disease (VZV, HSV, HIV, Toxoplasma
gondii) and from other conditions that may result from atypical immune
system activity (i.e. rheumatoid factor, RF, antinuclear autoantibodies, ANA).
All samples tested were confirmed negative to Anti-HAV antibodies using an
FDA cleared device. From the 346 samples tested 8 samples were positive and
6 were equivocal on the Liaison® Anti-HAV test. The incident of the
discordant samples is not significantly different from the claimed assay
specificity. The potential cross reactivity was identified to be due to antibodies
against HIV 1/2, anti-nuclear autoantibodies and rheumatoid factor.

DiaSorin evaluated the effect of potential interfering substances on sample
results generated using the LIAISON® Anti-HAV based on the guidelines
established in CLSI EP7-A2. Twelve samples at different anti-HAV levels (2
positive, 4 borderlines, 4 equivocal, 2 high negative) were prepared with and
without the potentially interfering substances hemoglobin, triglycerides,
bilirubin and albumin. All samples were tested with the LIAISON® anti-HAV
assay and results were compared using a paired t-test. The results showed that
the assay performance was not affected by hemolysis at ≤1000 mg/dL
hemoglobin (2% change, 100% concordance of results with and without
interferent), lipemia at ≤3000 mg/dL triglycerides (7% change, 92% (11/12)
concordance of results with and without interferent), icterus at ≤5 mg/dL
bilirubin (0% change, 100% concordance of results with and without
interferent) and serum albumin at ≤5 g/dL (3% change, 92% (11/12)

for three days, two runs per day using two different kit lots. A summary of the
results is presented in the table below. The obtained analytical sensitivity

The cut-off was set at an index value of 1.0 which is corresponds to
approximately 20mIU/ml. The accuracy of the assays cut-off was
analysedby ROC analysis using 997 clinical samples. The analysis
demonstrated that the selected cut-off provides the best level of specificity
without compromising sensitivity and a grey zone of +/- 10% of the cut-
off was included to address the observed assay imprecision. The cut-off
was validated in U.S. clinical trials in which 998 samples were tested. The
samples consisted of single samples from different selected populations
(500 samples from individuals who were sent to the laboratory for
Hepatitis A testing, 239 samples from individuals who were considered to
be ‘at risk’ for viral hepatitis, 108 samples from a pediatric population and
151 samples from individuals who have a current or had a previous HAV
infection). Based on available clinical and laboratory data, the samples
were classified as expected negative or positive for antibodies to Hepatitis
A and were evaluated with the LIAISON® Anti-HAV assay.
Analytical sensitivity demonstrated by Seroconversion Panel Performance
Four commercially available HAV seroconversion panels and one mixed
titer panel were tested using LIAISON® Anti-HAV and the FDA approved
comparator assay to determine the sensitivity of the assay. The results are

Prospective and retrospective studies were performed to compare the
performance of the LIAISON® Anti-HAV assay to an FDA cleared predicate
device. The prospective study consisted of 739 samples from individuals who
were sent to the laboratory for HAV testing or samples from individuals “At
Risk” for viral hepatitis, 108 samples from a pediatric population and 73
adults who participated in a vaccine study.
The retrospective study consisted of 109 samples from adults with a current or
previous hepatitis A infection and 42 pediatric patients with current hepatitis
A infection:
The data was analyzed including counting the equivocal results from the
comparator and the investigational device against the performance of the
investigational device.
Prospective
HAV Testing and At Risk Populations
Of the 739 samples in this study 500 were excess serum samples from
individuals in the Northeastern U.S. sent to the laboratory for HAV testing. In
this group 59.8% were female (n=299) ranging in age from 20 - 101 yrs. and
40.2% were male (n=201) ranging in age from 17 to 89. The remaining 239
samples were from individuals at risk for viral hepatitis due to lifestyle,
behavior or occupation. This group consisted of the following: homosexual
males (n=38), healthcare workers (n=10), commercial sex workers (n=34),
drug users (n=77), prison inmates (n=49), dialysis patients (n=25) and
hemophiliacs (n=6). Of these subjects 29.7% were females (n=71) ranging in
age from 17 to 79, and 43.1% were males (n=103) ranging in age from 16 to
79. The age and gender were unknown for the remaining 27.2% (n=65).
Two samples were Equivocal by the Comparator ELISA assay after repeat
testing per the Instructions for use.
The data for the populations are shown in the tables below.

Vaccine study
The HAV antibody response to vaccination was evaluated with the three
different vaccines currently licensed in the United States: TWINRIX®
(Hepatitis A, Inactivated and Hepatitis B (recombinant), HAVRIX®
(Hepatitis A, Inactivated) both manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals
and VAQTA® (Hepatitis A, Inactivated) manufactured by MERCK & CO.,
INC. For TWINRIX® vaccine, 9 matched sets of pre- and post-vaccine
samples were available. For HAVRIX® vaccine, 32 matched sets of pre- and
post-vaccine samples were available. For VAQTA® vaccine, 32 matched sets
of pre- and post-vaccine samples were available.

b. Matrix comparison :
Fifty sample sets of matched serum/plasma were used in the study to evaluate
the risk of potential unspecific reaction related to the use of sodium heparin
plasma. The graph demonstrates the comparison grouped by negatives,
equivocal and low reactive samples and demonstrates similarity between the
matrices.
