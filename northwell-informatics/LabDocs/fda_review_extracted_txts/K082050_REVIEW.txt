I. Device Description: The LIAISON® HAV IgM assay is an in vitro diagnostic device
that consists of magnetic particles, calibrators, specimen diluent, conjugate and HAV
antigen. The kit contains 100 tests. Additionally, controls are required to run the assay.
The LIAISON® HAV IgM immunoassay is performed on the LIAISON® Analyzer
(Model 15970) that was previously cleared (K062473, K071480). Magnetic particles are
beads coated with mouse monoclonal antibodies (IgG) to human IgM. During first
incubation, the magnetic particles are incubated with serum or heparinized plasma to
capture IgM antibodies to Hepatitis A Virus. During the second incubation, the
antibody conjugate reacts with HAV antigen just added and the immune complex
thus formed reacts with IgM already bound to the solid phase. The unbound
material is removed with a wash cycle after each incubation. Subsequently, a flash
chemiluminescence reaction is induced by adding the starter reagents. The light
signal, and hence the amount of isoluminol-antibody conjugate, is measured by a
photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) that is indicative of IgM anti-HAV
present in the samples.

antibody conjugate). During the first incubation, IgM antibodies present in
calibrators, samples or controls bind to the solid phase. During the second
incubation, the antibody conjugate reacts with HAV antigen and the immune
complex thus formed reacts with the IgM already bound to the solid phase. After
each incubation, the unbound material is removed with a wash cycle.
Subsequently, the starter reagents are added and a flash chemiluminescence

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility: A five-day reproducibility study was conducted at
three external laboratories. A coded panel comprised of 12 frozen contrived serum
samples was prepared by DiaSorin S.p.A. and provided to the sites. The coded panel
samples were prepared by spiking reactive samples into negative samples to achieve high
negative, low reactive and high reactive results. The two negative panel samples were
not spiked. The coded panel was tested at all three sites, one run per day using four
replicates per run for five operating days. The mean Index value and coefficient of
variation (%CV) of the results were computed for each of the tested specimens for each
of the sites.

1. Analytical Sensitivity as Seroconversion Panel Performance
Five commercially available HAV seroconversion panels were tested using LIAISON®
HAV IgM and the FDA approved comparator assay to determine when is to detect IgM
antibodies after infection and how long IgM can be detected after infection. The results
are summarized in the following table:

* Only reactive results were used; equivocal results were not used to determine a reactive
result.
The time point of the serial bleed when HAV IgM was first detected and the bleed when
it was no longer detected by the LIAISON® HAV IgM was equivalent to the comparator
assay in four out of five seroconversion panels. In one panel out of five the last day of
detection between the two assays differed by 14 days.
2. Cross Reactivity: The cross-reactivity study for the LIAISON® HAV IgM assay was
designed to evaluate potential interference from other viruses that may cause symptoms
similar to HAV infection (EBV, CMV, Rubella, Measles, Mumps, HBV, HCV), other
organisms that may cause infectious disease (VZV, HSV, HIV, Toxoplasma gondii) and
from other conditions that may result from atypical immune system activity (i.e.
rheumatoid factor, RF, antinuclear autoantibodies, ANA, human anti-mouse antibodies).
A total of 195 samples were tested and no cross reactivity was observed. Results are
presented in the following table.

Performance Characteristics
Summary of Clinical Studies
Prospective and Retrospective studies were performed to evaluate the performance of the
LIAISON® HAV IgM assay using samples sent to the testing laboratory for Hepatitis A
or other testing, from patients which were at high risk for viral hepatitis, showed signs
and symptoms of hepatitis infection, or were receiving an HAV vaccination.
The prospective studies consisted of 500 samples sent to the laboratory of Hepaptitis A
testing, 239 samples from individuals at risk for viral hepatitis, and 150 samples from
pediatric patients.
The retrospective study consisted of 123 samples from individuals with documented
acute Hepatitis A infection.
Prospective
Individuals sent to the Lab for Hepatitis A testing (HAV testing population)
A total of 500 samples collected from the Northeastern U.S. were included in this study.
Of the samples from individuals sent to the lab for HAV testing, 59.8% were female
(n=299) ranging in age from 20 - 101 yrs. and 40.2% were male (n=201) ranging in age
from 17 to 89.
Individuals At Risk for Viral Hepatitis
A total of 239 individuals at risk for viral hepatitis due to lifestyle, behavior or
occupation were included in this study. The 239 individuals were from the following at
risk groups: homosexual males (n=38), healthcare workers (n=10), commercial sex
workers (n=34), drug users (n=77), prison inmates (n=49), dialysis patients (n=25) and
hemophiliacs (n=6). Of the at risk individuals, 29.7% were females (n=71), ranging in
age from 17 to 79, and 43.1% were males (n=103) ranging in age from 16 to 79. The age
and gender were unknown for the remaining 27.2% (n=65).
The data for the combined prospective populations are shown in the following table.

Acute HAV Infection (Retrospective)
The retrospective population consisted of 123 samples from individuals who had an
(Acute) HAV infection. Of these 123 samples, 32.5% females (n=40) and 51.2% males
(n=63) ranging in age from 4 to 51. For 15.5% of the samples (n= 19) gender and age
were unknown. One sample (0.8%) was age 18, but gender was unknown. Of the 123
samples 42 were acutely infected pediatric patients
The 42 pediatric samples that had an acute infection were collected from children in
Egypt. Of the pediatric samples, 30.9% were females (n=13) and 69.1% were males
(n=29) all ranging in age from 4 to 17.

5. Expected values:
The expected prevalence results of the LIAISON® HAV IgM assay were
determined in 802 apparently healthy adults from the Western (historically high
prevalence) and the Eastern (historically lower prevalence) regions of the U.S.
Three hundred and one (301) samples were from the Western U.S. and 501 were
samples from the Eastern U.S.
Of the Western U.S. individuals 53.8% were females (n=162) ranging in age from 9
to 87 and 46.2% were males (n=139) ranging in age from 16 to 76. The majority of
the individuals were Caucasian (60.8%), with other ethnic groups were represented
as follows: Hispanic (17.6%), African Americans (15.3%), Asian (6.0%) and
Middle Eastern (0.3%). In the study group from the Western region, none of the
individuals were found to be reactive for HAV IgM antibodies.
Of the Eastern U.S. individuals 46.5% were females (n=233) ranging in age from
17 to 83, and 53.5% were males (n=268) ranging in age from 17 to 82. The
majority of the individuals were Caucasian (69.9%), with other ethnic groups
represented as follows: Hispanic (14.0%), African American (12.1%) and Asian
(4.0%). In the study group from the Eastern region none of the individuals were
found to be reactive for HAV IgM antibodies. The expected results for the Western

N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion: The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and
supports a substantial equivalence decision. The LIAISON® HAV IgM Assay including
Calibrators and LIAISON® Control HAV IgM (Part numbers: 310210, 310211) on the
LIAISON® Analyzer are substantially equivalent to the ETI-HA-IGMK Plus) for the
qualitative determination of IgM antibodies to Hepatitis A Virus in serum and
heparinized plasma.
