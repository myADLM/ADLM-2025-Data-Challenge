I. Device Description:
The Alcotest Quebec Alco Tube Plus Alcohol Detector is a visually read qualitative
test for the presence of alcohol in breath. It consists of a glass tube containing yellow
indicator crystals. The user is instructed to activate the device by pressing firmly on
either end of the plastic tube, and then to blow continuously for 12 seconds into the
device. A red indicator dot turns white when a sufficient sample has been provided.
Users are then instructed that their blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is greater than
the cutoff of the tester if the crystals have changed from yellow to green and extend
beyond a black indicator line on the tester. The testers are available at cutoffs of 0.05
and 0.08% BAC.

Length 10 cm 7 cm
Weight 7 grams 2 grams
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced
L. Test Principle:
The yellow indicator crystals inside the tube are coated with potassium dichromate
and sulfuric acid. In the presence of alcohol, the crystals change color from yellow to
green as the alcohol vapors are oxidized to acetic acid and chromium sulfate is
produced. The reagents in the tester are adjusted such that the majority of the
crystals change color at the designated cutoff.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
In lieu of testing by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
(Department of Transportation (DOT)), the sponsor performed their own testing
following the NHTSA guidelines.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Test samples were prepared using a Breath Alcohol Sample Simulator
(BASS), which provided alcohol-in-air test samples with known
concentrations.
The testers were read by ten individuals under five different lighting sources
(fluorescent, daylight, incandescent, sodium vapor, mercury vapor) using 60
randomized pre-reacted testers.
Results were as follows:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. This assay is a qualitative assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The device is traceable to commercially available certified alcohol reference
solutions at 100, 80, and 50 mg%.
d. Detection limit:
The NHTSA guidelines do not specifically address the detection limit of
breath alcohol devices but require testing at a % BAC of zero (blank reading)
to assess the possibility of false positives. The sponsor included zero
concentration samples in their precision study above. Non-alcoholic human
breath was used as the sample. All of the devices produced the expected
result.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed the following studies for both cut-off concentrations
(0.05 and 0.08% BAC) to evaluate the potential effect of cigarette smoke,
temperature and vibration.
Cigarette smoke - Five trials at 0.000 BAC were conducted. An alcohol-free

person who smokes cigarettes performed the test. The subject smoked
approximately one half of a cigarette and then tested their breath using the
Alco Tube Plus. This was then repeated to produce a total of five trials. No
false positive results were obtained under these conditions.
Temperature - The effect of temperature at 15o and 40o C (59o and 104o F)
was assessed. Forty (40) different devices were assessed at each temperature
for each cut-off. Twenty samples that were 60% below the device cut-off and
twenty samples that were 60 % above the cut-off were tested. There were no
deviations from the expected results.
Vibration - Forty 0.05% and forty 0.08% devices were mounted on a shake
table and vibrated. After vibration, 20 tests at 60% below the cut-off and 20
tests at 60% above the cutoff were performed for each tester. There were no
deviations from the expected results.
f. Assay cut-off:
The stated cutoffs are 0.05 and 0.08% BAC.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor conducted a consumer study comparing an Alco Tube Plus at a
cutoff of 0.05% and 0.08% BAC to a quantitative comparator device (the
Alco-Sensor IV). The purpose of the study was to determine if consumers
could correctly perform and interpret the test according to the package insert.
There were 20 paired volunteers (drinker, non-drinker) who participated in the
study which was conducted over two days. There were 12 males and 8
females and the reported age range was from 19 to 64 years of age. The non-
drinker administered the test to the drinker using both the 0.05 and 0.08 testers
and then read the results. The drinker then provided another breath sample
which was analyzed using the quantitative device operated by a trained
individual. The breath alcohol concentrations ranged from a BAC of 0.03 to
0.155% by the quantitative device. A total of 400 comparisons were
performed with the following results:
