510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
k082086
B. Purpose for Submission:
New device for US consumer market
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
The Ashley Collection Protocol Alcohol Breath Checker
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Quantitative (Semiconductor Oxide Alcohol Sensor)
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Protocol Breath Alcohol Tester is a self-contained unit with a sensor at the
top of the unit for breath sampling. The LCD display displays a timer that can be
used as a count-up timer or a count down timer. There are three buttons
corresponding to min, hour and start. The device also has three LCD colors –
green, yellow or red that correspond to the BAC concentration levels. Two AAA
batteries are inserted into the back of the unit. The device is powered on by
depressing the power button until the green LCD light is lit. To initiate a test, the
user presses the power button and holds it continuously during the testing. The
user blows for three seconds slowly and consistently and the LED codes will
appear based on the breath alcohol concentrations. A flashlight is also
incorporated into the device.
2. Principles of Operation:
The Protocol Alcohol Breath Checker is designed to measure deep lung air to test
for the presence of alcohol in the blood. The tin dioxide semiconductor gas sensor
is sensitive to changes in conductivity due to the presence of alcohol in the breath.
This change in conductivity due to the alcohol can be quantitated and converted to
% concentration of alcohol.

3. Modes of Operation:
This device has only one mode of operation. See section 2 above.
4. Specimen Identification:
There is no mechanism to identify the specimen.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The user provides a breath sample by exhaling into the device.
6. Calibration:
The device is calibrated at the factory and cannot be recalibrated after it has been
used. The labeling states that the device should be discarded after one year of
use.
Traceability:
This device is traceable to a commercially available certified alcohol reference
solution at a concentration of 0.06% BAC. This solution is used to calibrate the
devices during manufacture.

I. Special Control/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
The sponsor claims conformance to the following standards:
1) EN 61000-6-3: 2001 & EN 61000-6-1:2001; Electromagnetic compatibility
(EMC). Generic standards. Emission standard for residential, commercial and
light-industrial environments

J. Performance Characteristics:
Semi-quantitative devices such as the Protocol Alcohol Breath Checker device are not
eligible for testing by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
In lieu of NHTSA testing, the sponsor collected performance data to support a claim
of substantial equivalence for the device. This included testing at BAC
concentrations of zero, 0.025%, 0.065%, and 0.10% in addition to an accuracy study
performed by consumers.
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
The sponsor performed a consumer study to determine if consumers could
correctly use and interpret the device using only the supplied instructions for
use and compare to the results obtained by a commercially available NHTSA
approved professional breath alcohol tester (the LifeLoc FC10 plus). There
were 53 paired comparisons, and the volunteers ranged in age from 21 to 65
years of age. Each participant took their breath alcohol reading with the
Protocol Alcohol Breath Checker and recorded the result. Immediately
afterward, the participants were administered a breath alcohol test using the

0.050 %BAC green/yellow threshold. The numbers in the chart above
represent a 96% agreement to the professional device.
The sponsor had the study participants complete a questionnaire to determine
if the user understands the device and what the results mean. The
participants were asked the following questions and the responses are shown
in the table below. The package insert received a Flesch-Kincaid readability
score of 7.5.

*The labeling states “CAUTION: Your driving may be impaired at ANY level of alcohol
consumption. This may be true even if only the green light is lit. DON’T DRINK AND

The sponsor also conducted a stability study to support a claim that the device
can provide accurate results after 375 tests (without calibration). Over 10
successive days, the device was tested at 0.10% BAC, then tested 30 second
later at 0.00 %BAC. This was repeated for 375 times over 10 days with no
deviations from the expected results. The study result supports the claim that
the device was capable of providing results for 375 uses.
b. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed precision and accuracy testing for three BACs using a
Breath Alcohol Sample Simulator (BASS), which provides an alcohol-in-air
test sample with known alcohol concentrations, flow rate, and air

The NHTSA protocol requires testing of zero concentration samples to assess
the possibility of false positives. As part of their stability study, the sponsor
analyzed 375 zero concentration samples over 10 days. No false positives
were observed.
c. Linearity:
Since this device reports a range and not an actual concentration, it is not
possible to evaluate linearity.
d. Carryover:
Carryover studies were not performed using this device.
e. Interfering Substances:
This sponsor chose to duplicate the NHTSA requirement for cigarette smoke
interference. The sponsor evaluated the possibility of cigarette and cigar
smoke interference with the device. Two alcohol-free individuals were asked
to smoke approximately one half of a cigarette and cigar respectively. Within
one minute after smoking, the subject took a breath alcohol reading. The
subject then smoked another inhalation and repeated the test to produce a total
of five trials. The Protocol device produced zero false positives in this
experiment.
The sponsor has placed the following warning in their labeling:
“Our testing has shown that this device functions accurately for at least 375
tests. Based on NIAAA studies, (www.alcoholism.about.com) this
corresponds to one year of device use for most drinkers. YOU SHOULD
REPLACE YOUR DEVICE ONE YEAR AFTER FIRST USE. FAILURE
TO DO SO MAY CAUSE YOUR READINGS TO BE INACCURATE. If
you are a heavy drinker or a heavy smoker, we strongly recommend replacing
the unit sooner.”
