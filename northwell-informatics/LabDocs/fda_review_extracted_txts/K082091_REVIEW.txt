I. Device Description:
The Dry Tri T-STAT (CD3/CD4/CD8) Reagent is formulated in buffered saline with
sodium azide and stabilizers. It contains ATTO 488 – labeled CD4 monoclonal
antibody, clone RPAT4; phycoerythrin (PE) – labeled CD8 monoclonal antibody,
clone LT8; and PE-DY- 649 – labeled CD3 monoclonal antibody, clone UCHT1. The
specificities of the monoclonal antibodies used in the Dry Tri T-STAT
(CD3/CD4/CD8) were confirmed by the Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens
(HLDA) Workshops (9). A precise number of fluorescent counting beads are included
in the Dry Tri T-STAT reagent to allow single-platform determination of absolute
CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts. The Dry-Tri T-STAT reagent is provided in dried
form and dispensed in flow cytometer compatible sample tubes with each tube
containing one ready-to-use test. Fifty (50) tests are supplied in each Dry Tri T-STAT
(CD3/CD4/CD8) package.

L. Test Principle:
The Dry Tri T-STAT (CD3/CD4/CD8) reagent consists of murine monoclonal
antibodies that specifically recognize the human leukocyte surface antigens, CD3,
CD4, and CD8. Each of the monoclonal antibodies is labeled with a unique
fluorochrome. Specific cell subsets are stained when blood is combined with the
reagent and each monoclonal antibody binds to the binds to the cell determinant
molecules on the cell surface. Specific cell subsets are identified when passed through
a flow cytometer laser beam.
The Dry Tri T-STAT (CD3/CD4/CD8) reagent also contains a precise number of
fluorescent beads. When the reagent is combined with a known volume of blood the
reagent provides for the single platform determination of the absolute cell
concentrations of the stained subsets. The volume of sample analyzed can be
determined by multiplication of the total sample volume by the fraction of total beads
that were detected during the analysis.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of measurement was determined for three concentrations
of CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T-cells counts analyzed in replicates of ten.
The results are tabulated below.
Level Mean SD %CV
(cells/µL)
CD3+CD4+ Low 29 1.7 6
T-cells Medium 607 23.6 3.9
High 1173 66.3 5.7
CD3+CD8+ Low 655 45.1 6.9
T-cells Medium 770 37.1 4.8
High 1557 30 1.9
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Assay linearity was determined by testing six point dilution series, 64-1680
CD3+CD4+ T-cells/μL and 32-1640 CD3+CD8+ T-cells/μL. The
measurement at each level was performed in triplicate. The assay was
determined to be linear for CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T-cells with
correlation coefficients (r2) of 0.995 and 0.999, respectively.
The two dilution series spanned the specified reportable ranges of 65-1500
CD3+CD4+ T-cells/μL and 40-1500 CD3+CD8+ T-cells/μL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Reagent stability was tested by staining control material cells over 52 weeks.
The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the cells was measured and tracked,
in triplicate. The data presented demonstrated the relative MFI of the CD3-
PE-Dyomics 649, CD4-Atto488 and CD8-PE conjugates were not diminished
of the 52 week period.
