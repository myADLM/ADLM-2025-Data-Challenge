I. Device Description:
The GeneXpert Dx System automates and integrates sample purification, nucleic acid
amplification and detection of the target sequence in whole blood using real-time
1

--- Page 2 ---
PCR assays. The system consists of an instrument, personal computer, handheld
barcode scanner, and pre-loaded software for running tests and viewing results. The
system requires the use of single-use disposable cartridges that hold the PCR reagents
and host the PCR process. Because the cartridges are self-contained, cross-
contamination between samples is eliminated.
The Xpert HemosIL Factor II & Factor V Assay includes primers and probes for the
detection of Factor II allele (at position 20210) and the Factor V gene (at position
1691) in sodium citrate or EDTA anticoagulated whole blood. Each assay kit consists
of two single-use reagents (Reagent 1 and Reagent 2), one each of the Xpert
HemosIL Factor II & Factor V disposable fluidic cartridge. Each cartridge contains a
Probe Check Control (PCC) that verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in the
cartridge, probe integrity and dye stability. The primer and probes in the Xpert
HemosIL Factor II & Factor V Assay determine the genotype of the Factor II gene.

L. Test Principle:
The Cepheid Xpert™ HemosIL®Factor II & Factor V Assay is an automated DNA
test for detecting Factor II and Factor V normal and mutant alleles directly from
sodium citrate or EDTA anticoagulated whole blood specimens. Blood specimens are
drawn into either sodium citrate or EDTA anticoagulant tubes. Following brief
mixing of the sample, the blood sample and two single-use reagents (Reagent 1 and
Reagent 2) that are provided with the assay are transferred to different, uniquely-

labeled chambers of the disposable fluidic cartridge (the Xpert HemosIL Factor II &
Factor V cartridge). The user initiates a test from the system user interface and places
the cartridge into the GeneXpert® Dx System instrument platform, which performs
hands-off real-time, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of
DNA. In this platform, sample preparation, amplification, and real-time detection are
all fully-automated and completely integrated.
The GeneXpert Dx System consists of a GeneXpert instrument, personal computer, a
barcode scanner and the multi-chambered fluidic cartridges that are designed to
complete sample preparation and real-time PCR for detection of Factor II and Factor
V normal and mutant alleles in approximately 30 minutes. Each system has 1 to 16
randomly accessible modules that are each capable of performing separate sample
preparation and real-time PCR tests. Each module contains a syringe drive for
dispensing fluids, an ultrasonic horn for lysing nuclei, and a proprietary I-CORE®
thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and detection.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A panel of five specimens, consisting of one of each specimen type (a wild
type (NOR) sample, heterozygous Factor II/wild type Factor V, homozygous
Factor II/wild type Factor V, wild type Factor II/homozygous Factor V, and a
wild type Factor II/heterozygous Factor V) was tested in duplicate by two
different operators on five different days at each of three sites (3 specimens x
2 times/day x 2 operators per site x 5 days x 3 sites). A different lot of Xpert
HemosIL Factor II & Factor V Assay kit was used at each of the three testing
sites. Xpert HemosIL Factor II & Factor V assays were performed according
to the Xpert HemosIL Factor II & Factor V procedure. Results are
summarized in the table below. The number of samples correctly called vs.
the number of samples tested are indicated in parentheses.

tested. Shipping simulation stability studies at summer and winter
temperatures were performed on one lot per package configuration. No
significant difference was seen with samples tested with the assay for units
stored for 3 months up to 45±3°C from baseline. Real time studies beyond 25
months are ongoing, but based on 9 months of real time data and linear
regression extrapolation, the recommended expiration date for the assay is 14
months when stored at 2-28°C.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical sensitivity - Studies were performed to determine the minimum and
maximum amount of input patient specimen for both sodium citrate and
EDTA anticoagulated whole blood needed to obtain a correct genotype, such
that the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the estimated “correct
call” fraction is greater than 95%. Sodium citrate and EDTA anticoagulated
blood samples were tested (n = 20) at eight volumes varying from 5 µL to 250
µL. The recommended sample volume for the Xpert HemosIL Factor II &
Factor V Assay is 50 µL, although the assay can tolerate varying volumes
from 15 µL – 100µL.
e. Analytical specificity:
To evaluate the analytical specificity of the Xpert HemosIL Factor II & Factor
V Assay, normal gene sequences containing silent single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in the probe binding region as well as outside the
probe binding region were synthesized. The presence of the additional SNP in
the probe binding region, in most cases, resulted in an invalid result. When a
valid result was obtained, it gave the correct genotype. The presence of an
additional SNP outside the probe binding region resulted in the correct
genotyping call.
Interfering substances – Matched EDTA and sodium citrate blood samples
were tested for potential interference by the following endogenous substances:
bilirubin, cholesterol, lipids and hemoglobin. The samples consisted of 11
Factor V heterozygous samples from 10 individual donors, and 11 Factor II
heterozygous samples from 11 individual donors. Specimen 11 in each case
was a compound heterozygote. The study compared control conditions per
donor and anticoagulant (no additional interfering substance added to donor
blood) to substances added at the recommended high analyte test/interference
concentrations per CLSI EP7-A. The recommended interference
concentrations tested were bilirubin (unconjugated) spiked at 20 mg/dL, total
cholesterol spiked at 500 mg/dL, and lipids spiked at levels equivalent to or
greater than 500 mg/dL. To mimic the effects of hemolysis, blood samples
were stored frozen at -80°C and then thawed before testing and comparison to
the control (unfrozen/thawed) sample. The correct genotype was reported for
all samples using the Xpert HemosIL FII & FV Assay. The maximum valid
cycle threshold (Ct) cutoff for the Xpert HemosIL FII & FV Assay is 33.0.
The analysis of interfering substances data shows that the anticoagulant has no
statistical significance with p-values greater than 0.05. While some of the
interfering substances show some statistical significance, the practical
7

--- Page 8 ---
significance is minimal due to distance from the Ct cutoff value. In all cases,
the mean Ct remains more than 5.5 Cts below the cutoff value or more than
6.4 standard deviations below the cutoff. Studies of potentially interfering
substances showed no inhibition from up to 14.3 USP units/mL heparin, 16
mg/dL bilirubin, 250 mg/dL added cholesterol, or 1932 mg/dL total
triglycerides (lipids). No inhibition was observed using whole blood samples
which had gone through one freeze-thaw cycle (hemolyzed blood).
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance characteristics of the Xpert HemosIL Factor II & Factor V Assay
relative to bi-directional sequencing were determined in a multi-site
investigational study at seven U.S. institutions. Specimens included those
whose routine care called for collection of whole blood for Factor II and
Factor V testing. Samples were first tested by routine methods used in each
participating laboratory and then aliquots collected for study testing by Xpert
HemosIL Factor II & Factor V Assay on the GeneXpert. Excess DNA was
sent to a contract laboratory for bi-directional sequencing. Performance of the
Xpert HemosIL Factor II & Factor V Assay was calculated relative to bi-
directional sequencing results.
A total of 1018 samples were tested for Factor II and a total of 1014 samples
were tested for Factor V by both the Xpert HemosIL Factor II & Factor V
Assay and by bi-directional sequencing. To supplement the homozygous
sample size, six human genomic DNA samples homozygous for Factor II and
five homozygous for Factor V were also tested by the Xpert HemosIL Factor
II & Factor V Assay and bi-directional sequencing. The Xpert HemosIL
Factor II & Factor V Assay demonstrated a 99.3% overall accuracy relative to
bi-directional sequencing for both Factor II and Factor V. The results are
presented in the table below.
