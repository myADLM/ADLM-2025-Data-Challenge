1. Intended use(s):
The Cepheid Xpert™ MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay performed on the
GeneXpert® Dx System™ is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test intended for
the detection of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) DNA directly from patient positive blood
cultures. The assay utilizes automated real-time polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) for the amplification of MRSA/SA specific DNA targets and
fluorogenic target-specific hybridization probes for the real-time detection of
the amplified DNA. The assay is performed directly on positive blood culture
specimens using BD BACTEC™ Plus Aerobic/F blood culture bottles that are
determined as Gram Positive Cocci in Clusters (GPCC) or as Gram Positive
Cocci in singles (GPC) by Gram stain. The Cepheid Xpert™ MRSA/SA
Blood Culture Assay is not intended to monitor treatment for MRSA/SA
infections. Subculturing of positive blood cultures is necessary to recover
organisms for susceptibility testing or for epidemiological typing.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
To be used with the GeneXpert® Dx System (GX-4 or GX-16 instruments,
and the GeneXpert® Dx System Software 1.6b)
I. Device Description:
The Cepheid XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay system performs real-time,
multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the amplification and detection of
specific DNA targets after an initial sample processing and reagent addition step.
Additional sample preparation, amplification, and real-time detection are all fully-
automated and completely integrated. The assay is performed on a GeneXpert®
Dx System, which consists of the GeneXpert instrument, personal computer,
hand-held barcode scanner, and disposable fluidic cartridges that are designed to
complete sample preparation and real-time PCR for detection of MRSA and SA
DNA targets in about 50 minutes. Each instrument contains 2 to 16 randomly
accessible modules that are each capable of performing separate sample
preparation and real-time PCR tests. Each module contains a syringe drive for
dispensing fluids, an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or spores, and I-CORE®
thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and detection.
The single-use cartridges contain: (1) eleven chambers for holding sample,
reagents, or other materials, (2) a valve body composed of a plunger and syringe
barrel, (3) a rotary valve system for controlling the movement of fluids between
chambers, (4) an area for capturing, concentrating, washing, and lysing
cells/spores, (5) dry real-time PCR reagents, and (6) an integrated PCR reaction
tube that can be automatically filled by the instrument. All fluids including
amplicons are contained within the disposable cartridge to minimize test-to test
contamination. The instrument never comes into contact with any fluids within the
cartridge. Each disposable cartridge tests one sample, and is not re-usable.
The Cepheid XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay includes reagents for the
detection of staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus
aureus specific DNA sequences. The primers and probes in the XpertTM
MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay specifically detect DNA sequences of the
staphylococcal protein A (spa) (a pair of primers and one FAM labeled TaqMan
probe), the gene for methicillin/oxacillin resistance (mecA) (a pair of primers and
one CF4-3 labeled TaqMan probe), and staphylococcal chromosomal cassette
(SCCmec) inserted into the staphylococcus aureus chromosomal attB site (one
forward primer and seven reverse primers, and one CF5-6 labeled TaqMan probe).
The test also includes a sample processing control (SPC) to control for adequate
3

--- Page 4 ---
processing of the target bacteria and to monitor the presence of inhibitor(s) in the
PCR assay to avoid false-negative results. The SPC also ensures the PCR
conditions (temperature and time) are appropriate for the amplification reaction
and that the PCR reagents are functional. The Probe Check Control (PCC) verifies
reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye
stability.
An aliquot of the positive blood culture that is determined as Gram Positive Cocci
in Clusters (GPCC) or as Gram Positive Cocci in singles (GPC) by Gram stain is
collected and transported to the GeneXpert® area for testing. Using the small
transfer pipettes provided with the kit, one drop of the patient positive blood
culture specimen is transferred to the elution reagent vial. Following a brief vortex
step, the entire contents of the mixed material and two other reagents are
transferred to uniquely identified chambers of the cartridge. The cartridge is then
loaded into the instrument. The GeneXpert® performs sample preparation by
mixing the sample with the SPC (bacillus globigii in the form of a dry spore cake
within the cartridge) and treatment reagents, capturing the bacterial cells on a
filter, lysing the cells using glass beads and an ultrasonic horn, then eluting the
released DNA. The DNA solution is then mixed with dry PCR reagents and
transferred into the PCR tube for real-time PCR and detection.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay was
evaluated using a panel of 10 simulated samples (cultured MRSA and SA
bacteria spiked at varying levels to a mixture of human blood and blood
culture media which were mixed at the dilution of 10 ml staphylococcus
aureus- free whole blood per BD BACTECTM Plus Aerobic/F blood culture
bottle) that included high negative (0.1 X the assay LoD), low positive (the
assay LoD) and moderate positive (2-3 X the assay LoD) MRSA or SA
samples, and a negative sample contained a methicillin-sensitive
staphylococcus epidermidis strain. The MRSA strains used to prepare the
simulated samples were N315 (MRSA1, SCCmec type II, USA 100,
representing a prevalent healthcare-associated MRSA strain) and MW2
(MRSA2, SCCmec type IVa, USA 400, representing a prevalent community-
associated MRSA strain). The SA strain used to prepare the simulated samples
was N7129. Bacterial dilutions were quantified prior to testing. Panel samples
were tested at each of the 3 testing sites twice per day for 10 days using one
XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay lot (10 samples X 2 runs/day X 10
days X 3 sites = 600). The total percent agreement for the XpertTM MRSA/SA
Blood Culture Assay was 100%. The XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay
is a qualitative assay based partially on numerical Cycle Threshold (Ct) values.
The overall Ct value %CV across all sites for all samples ranged from 1.3% to
3.6% depending upon analyte type, target type, and concentration tested. This
data is acceptable for this device. Detailed reproducibility study results are
presented in the following table:

Controls
Internal Controls
The XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay includes internal controls,
including a sample processing control (SPC) to control for adequate
processing of the target bacteria and to monitor the presence of inhibitor(s)
in the PCR assay to avoid false-negative results. The pivotal clinical study
data validated the pre-determined SPC Ct cut-offs of 3 to 45.
The Probe Check Control (PCC) verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube
filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability. The PCC is
considered to “PASS” if the fluorescence generated meets the validated
acceptance criteria using the Lot Specific Parameters (LSP) determination
process.
External Controls
The external controls utilized in the clinical trial consisted of 1 negative
and 5 different MRSA positive controls in human blood/simulated wound
matrix (concentrated white blood cells resuspended in human plasma,
mixed 1:2 with PBS buffer containing 15% glycerol). The negative control
is just matrix basepool without bacteria. The MRSA positive controls are
9924 (SCCmec type I, 8,000 CFU/tube), 2926 (SCCmec type II, 4,300
CFU/tube), 11515 (SCCmec type III, 13,300 CFU/tube), 9897 (SCCmec
type IV, 9,100 CFU/tube), and ST45-MRSA-V (SCCmec type V, 13,600
CFU/tube). One negative and one positive external control were run on
each day that GeneXpert testing was performed, prior to testing any patient
specimens, during the clinical trial. The external positive controls
representing the five different SCCmec cassette types were rotated daily.
Of the 273 negative and positive external controls tested, 99.3% (217/273)
of these controls gave correct results. Correct results were obtained after
retesting for the remaining 2 external controls.
Performance of ready-to-use external control materials manufactured by
MicroBioLogics (St. Cloud, Minnesota) was also evaluated.
MicroBioLogics KWIK-STIKTM is a self-contained unit including a single
microorganism strain in a lyophilized pellet, a reservoir of hydrating fluid,
and inoculating swab. The selected KWIK-STIKTM controls include a
negative control containing methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus
epidermidis cells (MicroBioLogics catalog number 0371; ATCC number
12228), methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus cells (MicroBioLogics
catalog number 0360; ATCC number 25923), and methicillin-resistant
staphylococcus aureus cells (MicroBioLogics catalog number 0158;
13

--- Page 14 ---
ATCC number 700699; SCCmec type II). Replicates of 20 each of the
external controls were run per the manufacturer’s instructions using the
XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay. Reproducible performance was
observed when using the ready to use KWIK-STIKTM lyophilized reference
stock cultures. The sponsor is recommending these external controls to the
end users in the package insert.
Stability
Assay Reagent Stability
The XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay reagent stability was
demonstrated in stability studies using real-time stability results and linear
regression analysis to support a shelf-life of 12 months when the reagents
and cartridge are stored at 2-8ºC. The real-time stability testing is ongoing
with 3 lots when stored under 5±3ºC, 25±3ºC, 35±3ºC and 45±3ºC at
predefined time intervals up to 24 months. The actual shelf-life dating will
be determined by the results of real-time stability studies and approved by
the stability committee in compliance with approved procedures at the time
of product clearance.
An open package study was conducted to evaluate functional performance
after leaving the pouch open for 24 hours and 48 hours at 2-8ºC and 25ºC.
It was determined that there was no significant performance difference
after leaving the package open for up to 48 hours at 2-8ºC and 24 hours at
25ºC.
Shipping condition studies were conducted to demonstrate that the XpertTM
MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay package systems were suitable for
shipment of assay kits, and the assay performance was not affected after
being subjected to specified worst case shipping conditions.
Specimen stability
The recommended maximum time of 4 hours between sample aliquot and
Xpert start was verified using the clinical study data stratified in the
following 4 categories: 0-1 hour; 1-2 hours; 2-3 hours; and 3-4 hours.
Relative to sensitivity and specificity, the Fisher’s Exact test showed no
statistical difference for either MRSA or SA among any of the four time
groups.
Sample stability as a function of time the sample sits in the sample
chamber of the GeneXpert cartridge in the GeneXpert instrument for up to
3 hours was established by testing the unprocessed sample remaining in
the sample chamber of the cartridge at 0 hour, 0.5 hour, 1 hour, 2 hour and
4 hour time points. One-way ANOVA indicated that there was no
14

--- Page 15 ---
statistically significant performance differences observed when positive
blood culture samples were left in the sample chamber of the cartridge in
the GeneXpert instrument.
GeneXpert Dx System Calibrations
Optical and thermal calibration of the GeneXpert Dx System is performed
by Cepheid at the time of manufacture prior to installation and once yearly
or after 1,000 runs per module (current labeling recommendation) by
Cepheid.
The data from the thermal calibration study demonstrated that a 2,000 run
thermal stability claim can be supported with a predicted failure rate of
0.7%. The data from the optical calibration variation study reveled that the
Xpert assays can continue to function effectively even when the instrument
optical calibrations are off by as much as +/- 50%. The data from the decay
of optical calibration study demonstrated that the average optical
calibration change after 2,000 runs ranged from -3.96% to -8.82% for four
different optical channels. With a 99% confidence interval, the worst case
change ranged from -9.66% to -13.8% after 2,000 runs.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection or LoD) of the XpertTM
MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay was determined using quantified
(CFU/mL) cultures of 6 isolates and 3 MSSA isolates, serially diluted in a
simulated sample matrix consists of a mixture of human blood and blood
culture media which were mixed at the dilution of 10 ml Staphylococcus
aureus- free whole blood per 25 ml BD BACTECTM Plus Aerobic/F blood
culture bottle media. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis
(MSSE) at 106 CFU/ml was also added to the simulated sample matrix to
simulate the most common skin contaminant organism. The MRSA
isolates used in this study were 64/6146 (SCCmec type I, USA 500), N315
(SCCmec type II, USA 100, representing a prevalent healthcare-associated
MRSA strain), 11373 (SCCmec type III, unknown PFGE type), MW2
(SCCmec type IVa, USA 400, representing a prevalent community-
associated MRSA strain), ST59-MRSA-V (SCCmec type V, USA 1000),
and HDE288 (SCCmec type VI, USA 800). The SA isolates used in this
study were N7129 (USA900), 102-04 (USA1200), and 29213 (unknown
PFGE type). These well characterized bacterial isolates were obtained
from various bacterial strain collections and investigators worldwide, and
most of them were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).
Simulated specimens were quantified by plate counts prior to testing. Each
bacterial isolate was tested in replicates of 20 per concentration of
15

--- Page 16 ---
simulated specimens.
The LoD point estimates were determined using Logistic Regression
Analysis, and the 95% upper and lower confidence intervals were
determined using maximum likelihood estimates on the logistic model
parameters using the large sample variance-covariance matrix. The data
are presented in the following tables:

The LoD is defined as the lowest number of colony forming units (CFU)
per sample that can be reproducibly distinguished from negative samples
with 95% confidence or the lowest concentration at which 19 of 20
replicates were positive. The sponsor has chosen to claim LoDs of 250
CFU/test for MRSA and 100 CFU/test for MSSA.
Due to the enrichment process involved in blood cultures, all positive
blood culture specimens contain very high bacterial loads resulting in
CFUs per test well above the estimated LoDs of the assay. Therefore, it is
not necessary to confirm the estimated LoDs of the assay for this specific
intended use.
e. Effect of Competing Amounts of SA on the Limit of Detection of MRSA
The competitive inhibitory effect of increasing amounts of SA relative to
MRSA at LoD was evaluated for each SCCmec type I, II, III, Iva, V and
VI MRSA isolates. The analytical study was conducted to test MRSA
specimens at the claimed LoD concentration for each SCCmec type in the
presence of SA at ten-fold increasing concentrations (i.e. MRSA to SA
ratios of 1:1, 1:10, 1:102, 1:103, 1:104, 1:105 and 1:106). Bacterial cells
used in this study were diluted into a simulated sample matrix consists of a
mixture of human blood and blood culture media which were mixed at the
dilution of 10 ml Staphylococcus aureus- free whole blood per 25 ml BD
BACTECTM Plus Aerobic/F blood culture bottle media. Methicillin-

sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) at 106 CFU/ml was also
added to the simulated sample matrix. No significant competitive
inhibitory effects were observed on the analytical LoD of MRSA SCCmec
types I, II, III, Iva, V or VI in the presence of competing SA cells at
MRSA to SA ratios of less than 1:105. At MRSA to SA ratios of greater
than 1:105, the competitive inhibitory effect of SA at the claimed LoD
concentrations for all SCCmec types is quite evident.
The following warning language was added to the “Interpretation of
Results” section of the package insert in light of the results:
“A False Negative for MRSA (a result of “MRSA NEGATIVE; SA
POSITIVE” instead of “MRSA POSITIVE; SA POSITIVE”) could be
obtained if both MRSA and SA are present in the sample at an
MRSA:SA ratio of 1:1x106 or greater.”
f. Analytical inclusivity:
The analytical inclusivity of the XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay
was evaluated in two studies. The first study evaluated 25 SA and MRSA
specimens supplied by CDC as representative of strains currently found in
the healthcare community. The second study was performed to evaluate a
larger and geographically broader number of SA and MRSA strains
selected to broadly represent the range of genetic diversity found in the
species staphylococcus aureus based on its phylogenetic structure.
Selections were made to represent the primary lineages with emphasis
placed on the specific clonal complexes within which MRSA is
predominantly observed. Lineages that contain MRSA and SA, as well as
those that contain SA exclusively were included.
Analytical Inclusivity Study on CDC Staphylococcus aureus Specimens
Twenty-five Staphylococcus aureus strains from multiple sources provided
by the CDC were tested using the XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood Culture
Assay. All strains were tested in triplicate using 100 ul of stationary phase
cell suspension diluted 10 million-fold. Colony forming units per assay
(CFU/test) were determined by plate counts in triplicate. Bacterial strain
identification, PFGE type and SCCmec type were determined by the CDC.
All results were reported correctly by the XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood
Culture Assay, except one specimen. Further investigation reveled that the
particular specimen was actually mislabeled by the CDC.
Analytical Inclusivity Study on Expanded Panel of Staphylococcus
aureus Specimens
One hundred twenty-one Staphylococcus aureus strains (78 MRSA strains
and 43 SA strains from 11 countries) were tested using the XpertTM
17

--- Page 18 ---
MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay. Strains broadly represent Cooper and
Feil Groups 1A, 1B, and 2, SCCmec types I, II, III, IV, Iva, IVb, IVc, V
and VI, 24 sequence types (STs), 83 spa-types and 18 clonal complexes
(CC). Overnight cultures were grown in Brian Heart Infusion (BHI) and
adjusted to 0.5 Mcfarland units (~ 3 x 108 CFU/ml). All strains were tested
in triplicate using cultures further diluted one hundred thousand-fold or
one million-fold, suggesting theoretically estimated bacterial
concentrations of 300 or 3,000 CFU/ml. Bacterial strain identification,
PFGE type, SCCmec type, spa-type, CC and STs were determined by the
source supplier.
The XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay correctly identified 116 of
121 strains. The 5 discordant samples were further characterized by Gram
stain (GS), catalase (Cat), tube coagulase (Coag) tests. Methicillin
susceptibility was also further assessed by disk diffusion (DD) test using a
30 ug cefoxitin disk and a diameter cut-off of 21/22 mm (disk diffusion
results less than 21 mm indicate resistance). Further investigation results
indicated that the XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay correctly
identified all 5 initially discordant strains. 5 of 7 suspected “empty cassette
variants” defined by the source supplier were correctly reported. Further
investigation reveled that the remaining 2 were actually methicillin-
resistant. Each of the 12 known USA300 isolates was correctly identified
by the assay.
g. Evaluation of Empty Cassette Variants:
Twenty-two Staphylococcus aureus isolates identified as “empty cassette
variants” by the supplier, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI, were
tested using the XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay. Overnight
cultures were grown in Brian Heart Infusion (BHI) and adjusted to 0.5
Mcfarland units (~ 3 x 108 CFU/ml). All isolates were tested using
cultures further diluted one hundred-fold (high) and one hundred thousand-
fold (low), suggesting theoretically estimated bacterial concentrations of 3
x 108 CFU/ml (high) and 3,000 CFU/ml (low) respectively.
All 22 isolates were reported MRSA negative: SA positive at both testing
concentrations using the XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay. These
results demonstrated that the XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay will
not likely to report a false positive MRSA result for an “empty cassette
variants”.

h. Evaluation of BORSA Strains:
Seven well characterized borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (BORSA) isolates (BORSA strains are mecA negative, but exhibit
an oxacillin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) >= 2 and <= 8 ug/ml
by a mechanism not completely understood, however infections by these
strains can be treated with B-lactams.) were received from University of
Toronto. These isolates were tested as triplicates at two concentrations
using the XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay. Each of the 7 BORSA
strains was streaked for isolation on blood agar. A single colony was
chosen from each to inoculate overnight cultures. At 18 hours these tryptic
soy broth (TSB) cultures were diluted one hundred-fold (high) and one
hundred thousand-fold (low). Dilutions of all cultures were plated in
triplicate and were found to range from 255,000 to 1,288,333 CFU/test
(high) and 255 to 1,288 CFU/test (low). The BORSA strains were also
characterized by Gram stain (GS), catalase (Cat), tube coagulase (Coag)
tests. Methicillin susceptibility was further assessed by disk diffusion (DD)
test using a 30 ug cefoxitin disk and a diameter cut-off of 21/22 mm (disk
diffusion results less than 21 mm indicate resistance). All 7 BORSA
isolates were reported MRSA negative: SA positive at both testing
concentrations using the XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay.
These results demonstrated that the XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood Culture
Assay will not report a false positive MRSA result for a BORSA strain.

i. Analytical specificity:
The analytical specificity of the XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay
was evaluated by testing a panel consisting of 105 microorganism strains,
98 strains were from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and 7
strains were from the Network on Antimicrobial Resistance in
Staphylococcus aureus (NARSA), which are phylogenetically related to
Staphylococcus aureus or potentially encountered in patients with positive
blood cultures or in a hospital environment. Of these, 29 strains of
methicillin-sensitive coagulase negative staphylococci and 9 strains of
methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci were included. The
organisms were identified as either Gram positive (74), Gram negative
(28), or yeast (3). The organisms were further classified as either aerobic
(95) or anaerobic (10). Stock cultures were prepared by suspending the
organism growth from an agar plate in PBS buffer containing 15%
glycerol. Each strain was tested using 100 ul of culture adjusted to 1.7 –
3.2 McFarland units. Positive and negative controls (approximately 103 to
104 CFU/test) were also included in the study. At least 2 replicates were
run for each strain.
None of the isolates tested were detected by the XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood
Culture Assay. The analytical specificity of the XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood
Culture Assay is 100%.
Assay cut-off:
Lot Specific Parameters and Assay Settings
Lot specific assay settings are generated for every lot manufactured to
account for slight variations in reagent production. The lot specific assay
settings (LSP file) (Normalization Factor and Probe Check Limits) are
incorporated into the 2-D barcode on each cartridge label and are
transferred to the GeneXpert Dx system via a hand-held barcode scanner
prior to initiating the XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay.
During clinical testing, 2.3% (7/298) eligible samples generated initial
error test results due to PCC setting violations or reported valve motion
failures. Upon repeat testing, 6 of the 7 provided valid results and 1 could
not be retested due to insufficient reagents available at the site to perform
the retest.
20

--- Page 21 ---
General Assay Settings
These parameters are general assay settings that are used for all reagent
lots. They are fixed and not part of the LSP process. The following table
lists general assay settings:
Attribute Setting
Background Subtraction Always ON
Background Minimum Cycle Default setting = 5
Background Maximum Cycle Manual setting = 30
Manual Threshold (all targets and SPC) Manual setting = 20
Curve Analysis Primary
Boxcar Average Cycles Zero (Off)
Valid Minimum Ct (all targets and SPC) Default setting = 3
Valid Maximum Ct (SPC) Manual setting = 45
Valid Maximum Ct (spa, mecA, SCCmec) Manual setting = 36
Maximum Pressure (Max PSI) Default setting = 120
The valid cycle range for the three MRSA targets (spa, mecA, SCCmec)
was set to 3 to 36 cycles based upon pre-clinical positive blood culture
data (n=406) and pre-clinical SA negative blood culture data (n=228)
collected during development to maximize percent sensitivity and percent
specificity. These cut-offs were subsequently validated in the pivotal
clinical study.
The valid cycle range (3 to 45) for the SPC was derived from analytical
data generated from MRSA/SA LSP testing of 3 development reagent lots,
simulated inhibitory studies with potentially interfering substances
including anticoagulated whole blood and blood culture media components
containing the anticoagulant sodium polyanetholesulfonate (SPS) or ion
exchange and nonionic adsorbent resins (to remove antimicrobials), and
pre-clinical SA negative blood culture data (n=228). The cut-off was also
subsequently validated in the pivotal clinical study. During clinical testing,
3.7% (11/298) eligible samples generated initial invalid test results due to
SPC failure. Upon repeat testing, 10 of the 11 provided valid SA negative
results and 1 was invalid a second time.
The maximum pressure setting of 120 psi ensures the integrity of the
cartridge and main valve body filter, preventing the potential for fluidic
leaks either internal or external to the cartridge. If the Max PSI setting is
exceeded during any fluidic movements within the cartridge, the
GeneXpert run is aborted. During clinical testing, no tests (out of a total of
298 eligible samples) exceeded the maximum pressure limit.

--- Page 22 ---
Substances that may be present in blood cultures with potential to interfere
with the XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay were tested in the
interfering substance study. Potentially interfering substances include, but
are not limited to, anticoagulated whole blood and blood culture media
components containing the anticoagulant sodium polyanetholesulfonate
(SPS) or ion exchange and nonionic adsorbent resins (to remove
antimicrobials). Negative samples (n=8) were tested in each substance to
determine the effect on the performance of the sample processing control
(SPC). Positive samples (n=8) with MRSA cells spiked near the LoD at
500 CFU/test were also tested in each substance. All results were
compared to positive and negative buffer controls.
All negative specimens were correctly reported MRSA negative: SA
negative using the XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay. None of the
potentially interfering substances had a statistically significant inhibitory
effect on SPC performance in negative samples (p-value = 0.260). All
positive specimens were correctly reported MRSA positive; SA positive
using the assay. Fisher’s exact tests conducted on the data generated with
and without these potentially interfering substances demonstrated that their
presence did not affect assay performance.
l. Carry-Over Contamination:
A study was conducted to demonstrate that single-use, self-contained
GeneXpert cartridges prevent carry-over contamination in negative
samples run following very high positive samples in the same GeneXpert
module. The study consisted of a negative sample processed in the same
GeneXpert module immediately following a very high MRSA positive
sample (roughly 107 CFU/test). This was repeated 20 times between 2
GeneXpert modules for a total of 42 runs.
There was no evidence of any carry-over contamination. All 21 positive
samples were correctly reported MRSA positive: SA positive (mean spa Ct
15.0, mean mecA Ct 15.0 and mean SCCmec Ct 16.8). All 21 negative
samples were correctly reported MRSA negative; SA negative (mean SPC
Bg Ct 34,2, and mean Cts for all three MRSA targets 0).

3. Clinical studies:
a. Prospective Clinical studies
Performance characteristics of the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay
were determined in a multi-site prospective investigational study. Three U.S.
clinical sites having Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
culture-based methods already in place participated in the study. Patients
were included in the study only if the doctor requested blood culture testing
to be performed for routine patient care. All specimens in the study meeting
the inclusion and exclusion criteria represented excess, left over material
from normal standard of care laboratory testing. All clinical sites were
granted waivers of informed consent by their IRB for this study. Inclusion
criteria included, but were not limited to: positive blood culture specimen
was taken from a BD BACTECTM Plus Aerobic/F bottle, and Gram Stain
contained either Gram Positive Cocci in Clusters (GPCC) or Gram Positive
Cocci in singles (GPC). Patients previously enrolled in the study were
denied repeat entry.
As a secondary goal of gathering information to potentially identify patients
with early MRSA or SA infections that as yet to show any organisms on
Gram stain, positive blood culture specimens taken from BD BACTECTM
Plus Aerobic/F bottles that were determined as no organisms were seen
(NOS) by Gram stain were also included in the clinical study initially.
Each clinical site’s standard-of-care culture that conformed to CLSI M47-A
was used as comparative method for assessing the performance of the Xpert
MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay, rather than sending samples to a central lab
for culture, since the sub-culturing of positive blood culture bottles after
transport and delay had not been validated. The culture methods all
consisted of initial analysis on blood agar plate (and chocolate agar,
MacConkey and CNA plates) after 24 and 48 hours of incubation using
Gram Stain. Presumptive colonies of Staphylococcus aureus were confirmed
with either tube or slide coagulation testing, latex agglutination assay, or
automated identification system. Susceptibility testing was performed on all
confirmed Staphylococcus aureus colonies at all study sites in accordance
with the CLSI documents M2-A9 and M100-S17, using the Cefoxitin disc
testing to detect methicillin/oxacillin resistance. (<= 21 mm = resistant; >=
22 mm = susceptible). Fisher’s Exact Test was used to determine whether
pooling the sensitivity and specificity data from three sites is appropriate. It
was determined that the data can be pooled across sites.

Of the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assays run on eligible specimens,
92.8% (233/251) of these specimens were successful on the first attempt.
The remaining 18 gave indeterminate results on the first attempt (10
“INVALID”, 7 “ERROR” and 1 “NO RESULT”). One of the indeterminate
specimens could not be retested due to insufficient reagents available at the
site to perform the retest (not eligible for inclusion). Of the 17 indeterminate
on the first attempt with sufficient sample for retest, 94.1% (16/17) gave a
result on the second attempt; one was indeterminate on the second attempt
(not eligible for inclusion).

There was a total of 30 positive patient blood culture specimens that were
determined as no organisms seen (NOS) by Gram stain included in the
clinical study. All of them tested negative (MRSA Neg; SA Neg) by the
Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay. The culture results of these
specimens were all “no growth” except 3 samples {1 Coagulase negative
Staphylococcus (CNS), 1 yeast and 1 Candida albicans}. Therefore, the
sponsor agreed to modify language to the labeling to limit the use of the test
to patients with Gram positive cocci (alone or in clusters).
Eleven positive blood culture bottles showed mixed cultures by Gram stain.
Only 1 positive blood culture bottle containing MRSA or SA showed
confirmed mixed cultures. Final culture results and the Xpert MRSA/SA

The performance of the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay in testing
positive blood culture specimens that are mixed culture specimens
containing MRSA or SA could not be thoroughly evaluated based on test
result from only 1 such specimen in the clinical study. The following
standard warning language in the package insert was included to address this
issue:
“In a mixed culture containing MRSA/SA and other organisms (e.g. Gram
negative bacilli, yeast), results can be false negative or variable depending
on the concentration of MRSA/SA present, particularly if the concentration
of MRSA/SA is close to the LoD of the assay.”

cartridge bases allow up to 4 and 16 single use cartridge, respectively, to be run
simultaneously. Up to four of the four-cartridge base GeneXpert Dx Systems may
be linked together.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
User enters Patient ID/Sample ID using hand-held barcode scanner or by
typing it in.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Not applicable
5. Calibration:
Optical and thermal calibration of the GeneXpert Dx System is performed
by Cepheid at the time of manufacture prior to installation and once yearly
or after 1,000 runs per module (current labeling recommendation) by
Cepheid.
Lot specific assay settings are generated for every lot manufactured to
account for slight variations in reagent production. The lot specific assay
settings (LSP file) (Normalization Factor and Probe Check Limits) are
incorporated into the 2-D barcode on each cartridge label and are
transferred to the GeneXpert Dx system via a hand-held barcode scanner
prior to initiating the XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay.
6. Quality Control:
The XpertTM MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay includes internal controls,
including a sample processing control (SPC) to control for adequate
processing of the target bacteria and to monitor the presence of inhibitor(s)
in the PCR assay to avoid false-negative results. The pivotal clinical study
data validated the pre-determined SPC Ct cut-offs of 3 to 45.
The Probe Check Control (PCC) verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube
filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability. The PCC is
considered to “PASS” if the fluorescence generated meets the validated
27

--- Page 28 ---
acceptance criteria using the Lot Specific Parameters (LSP) determination
process.
A cartridge loading and unloading mechanism assures the proper
positioning of the cartridge in the instrument. In addition, internal quality
controls perform a self-test before each test starts to verify that the system
is functioning properly. These tests consist of verification of heaters, fan,
and optics. There are also continuous checks for syringe drive and valve
stalling. The software also verifies ultrasonic actuation by monitoring horn
current during operation.
