H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Beckman-Coulter Body Fluid Control is a hematology quality control
material used to monitor the performance and verify the measuring range of the
body fluid cycle of the UniCel® DxH 800 COULTER Cellular Analysis System.
2. Indication(s) for use:
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
4. Special instrument requirements:
UniCel® DxH 800 COULTER Cellular Analysis System (K081930)
I. Device Description:
The Beckman-Coulter Body Fluid Control is a hematology quality control
mixture intended to be used with the UniCel® DxH 800 COULTER Cellular
Analysis System (K081930). It consists of 3 levels of treated, stabilized human
erythrocytes, a stabilized platelet-sized component, and fixed erythrocytes that
simulate leukocytes. The platelet-sized components are not assayed nor reported
in the body fluid cycle.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
COULTER® 5C® Cell Control (cleared as COULTER® PX Cell Control)
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
K912133, K060464
