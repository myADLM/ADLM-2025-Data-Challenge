L. Test Principle:
A glucose dehydrogenase sensor based on the carbon electrode adopting the
amperometric assay is provided. The reaction utilizes the enzyme glucose
dehydrogenase to catalyze the formation of gluconolactone from the oxidation of
glucose whereby two electrons are produced. Through the mechanism of the
mediator, electrical current is generated and it is proportional to the quantity of
glucose in the sample.
The reaction principle of reagent depends on following reaction equation:
GDH, FAD
Glucose + 2 ferricyanide gluconolactone + 2 ferrocyanide
electrode
ferrocyanide ferricyanide + e-
GDH: glucose dehydrogenase
FAD: flavin adenine dinucleotide
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed using ISO 15197 and CLSI Document EP5-
A as guidelines. Three lots of test strips were tested with 10 TaiDoc glucose
meters (TD-4230 model).

blood which was spiked with dextrose to provide samples at five different
glucose concentrations (30 – 50 mg/dL, 51 - 110 mg/dL, 111 – 150 mg/dL,
151 – 250 mg/dL and 251 - 400 mg/dL). Blood samples were tested within 30
minutes and hematocrit was normal (38-54%). 500 measurements were taken
for this portion of the study (100 measurements of each sample).
For day-to-day precision (intermediate precision), three control solutions with
concentrations of low, normal and high with target levels of 32-52 mg/dL, 69-
93 mg/dL, and 196-265 mg/dL were used to ensure no glycolysis effect. Day-

samples, and then the samples were measured by two lots of TaiDoc Pro I
Glucose Test Strips on a TD-4230 meter.
The samples were prepared and divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was
used to perform on the TaiDoc Pro I Glucose Test Strips and the second
aliquot was analyzed on the reference method. For each level solution, 10
consecutive tests (with 5 measurements per lot) were performed on each
meter.
Linear regression statistics:
range = 22.4 – 587 mg/dL (as measured by the reference method)
y = 0.9983x – 0.164
R2 = 0.9996
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibration: calibration of the test strip is done by entering measurement
parameters into the meter before testing, which can be done by users either by
inserting the code strip into the meter before testing or by selecting the code
number from the meter before testing.
Stability:
Storage Stability Study: The storage claims for this device are: 90 days for
open vial of strips stored at 2 – 32 °C and 24 months for unopened vials of
strips stored at 2 - 32°C. For the unopened vial stability claim, accelerated
testing of the strips was performed. Currently, there is 18 months of real-time
stability testing for unopened vials at the appropriate storage temperature.
The study protocols, summary of results and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and found to be adequate.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor has not conducted studies to determine the limit of detection
(LOD), however, as supported by linearity studies, the sponsor has established
the measuring range of 20 - 600 mg/dL for the Pro I Glucose Test Strips.
e. Analytical specificity:
Hematocrit: The potential effect of hematocrit was evaluated at 20%, 30%,
40%, 50%, and 60% hematocrit levels. Testing was performed with spiked
venous whole blood samples from normal, healthy donors. Samples with
seven different glucose concentrations spaced across the claimed measuring
range (20 – 600 mg/dL) at the different hematocrit levels were measured by
using YSI 2300 as a reference method and by using TaiDoc Pro I Glucose
Test Strips.
The data supports the sponsor’s claim that results generated by their device
are comparable to the values of the YSI-2300 instrument at hematocrit levels
between 20 – 60%.

Interference Study: Interference testing was conducted to determine the
effect of selected endogenous and exogenous substances. Ascorbic acid,
acetaminophen, dopamine, uric acid, bilirubin, triglyceride, fructose, galactose
and maltose were tested as potential interferents.
Testing was performed in parallel (control versus test samples) and
simultaneously to minimize the effects of glucose metabolism. The sponsor
used seven blood samples and evaluated two glucose levels. Three to four
levels of each compound were evaluated.
Paired differences of glucose measurements between drug-spiked samples and
neat control samples were calculated to determine the bias. A criterion of ±
10% was used as the cutoff for interference. There is no interference observed
in all interfering substances at therapeutic or physiological levels either at low
or high glucose levels.
Substance Reference range Concentration showing
(mg/dL) no interference (mg/dL)
Acetaminophen 1-2 5
Ascorbic acid 0.8-1.2 3
Dopamine 0.4-1.6 3.25
Bilirubin 1.2 15
Uric acid 7 10
Interference was seen for the following compounds at concentrations above
the therapeutic range for the following: acetaminophen (10 mg/dL), dopamine
(6.25 mg/dL), bilirubin (20 mg/dL), and uric acid (15 mg/dL).
No interference was detected when triglyceride, fructose, galactose and
maltose were tested.
Temperature/humidity study: A temperature and humidity study was
performed to determine the effects of variation in temperature and humidity
on the response of Pro I Glucose test strips with control solutions. Testing was
conducted using 250 strips and ten glucose meters at three temperatures (10,
25 and 40˚C) and two levels of humidity (50 and 60% RH). 60 measurements
for each test condition were obtained. Precision and accuracy was calculated
for each test condition and found to be acceptable.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Comparison to a reference method (YSI-2300):
Testing was done comparing Pro I Glucose strips (using 5 TaiDoc meters:
TD-4222, TD-4230, TD-4231, TD-3250, and TD-3260) against YSI-2300 at

three different sites. 120 subjects, including both men and women of varied
ages, were tested by professionals. Samples from 24 to 511 mg/dL were
included. Each fresh capillary whole blood sample used was from a different
individual, except for samples with concentrations less than 40 mg/dL and
greater than 400 mg/dL. For those specimens, a pooled capillary whole blood
specimen spiked to the desired level was used. Three lots of strips were tested.
The correlation data (regression analysis) is summarized as below:

100% of the samples tested with the proposed device had measurements fall
within ± 15 mg/dL of the measurements obtained with the YSI-2300 for
glucose concentrations less than 75 mg/dL.
98% of the samples tested with the proposed device had measurements fall
within ± 20% of measurements made with the YSI-2300 for glucose
concentrations equal to or greater than 75 mg/dL.
Comparison to a predicate device:
A 510(k) cleared device, k040796, was used as the comparative method. This
device comes from the same manufacturer. YSI-2300 analyzer is used as the
reference method to check the accuracy of both test method and comparative
method. The evaluation was done at 3 sites with 120 samples over 3 weeks
with three different lots of strips and 5 different models of TaiDoc meters.
Samples ranged from 24 – 511 mg/dL. Fresh capillary whole blood from
finger stick was used for samples 40 – 400 mg/dL. For those specimens less
than 40 mg/dL and greater than 400 mg/dL, a pooled capillary whole blood
specimen was used and spiked to the desired level.
