K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced
L. Test Principle:
Glucose measurement is based on electrical potential caused by the reaction of glucose with
the reagents contained on the strip’s electrodes. The glucose in the sample is oxidized by the
enzyme glucose oxidase, and the current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured
and converted to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is
proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated within-run precision of the device using whole blood collected
in an EDTA collection tube. The blood was then spiked with glucose to create five
different levels for testing. Each level was tested 50 times using a single lot of test
strips and a single device lot. Results are summarized below:
Average glucose 40.0 87.5 129.2 217.6 367.6
concentration (mg/dL)
SD (mg/dL) 1.6 2.9 3.6 6.5 6.5
CV (%) 4.0 3.3 2.8 3.0 1.8
The sponsor evaluated day-to-day precision of the device using 3 levels of control
solution. Each of the controls was measured twice a day, once in the morning (Run
1) and once in the afternoon (Run 2) during a month’s time. For each Run, two
measurement readings were taken in which the mean, standard deviation (SD), and
coefficient variation percent (CV%) were calculated. The same test strip lot and
device lot were used for the evaluation. In addition, the same lot of the 3 control
solutions (low, normal, high) was used. Results are summarized below.
Average glucose concentration 50.4 109.7 302.6
(mg/dL)
SD (mg/dL) 1.8 3.0 7.3
CV (%) 3.6 2.7 2.4
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To establish the linearity of the system through the range of 20 to 600 mg/dL, 14
glucose adjusted whole blood samples (actual range tested was 20 to 602 mg/dL
according to YSI and 20.8 to 602.8 mg/dL when tested with the meters) were
compared to YSI 2300 using 5 replicate measurements. Linear regression yields the
following statistics:
Slope y-intercept r2
G5 Infinity BGMS 1.0006 0.3031 0.9999

The sponsor claims 20 mg/dL as the lowest detectable limit in the labeling.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The reference instrument used is the YSI 2300 Glucose Analyzer and is calibrated by
YSI 2747 Glucose Standard, a NIST traceable glucose standard.
The three control solutions (low, normal, and high) consist of buffered aqueous
solutions of D (+)-glucose containing stabilizers, preservatives, and other non-
reactive ingredients.
Closed Vial Stability of Control Solution: The measured glucose levels of 3 lots of
control solutions during the shelf lifetime period (26 months) are all within the
acceptance criteria of ±15%, and the average bias with respect to the mean value
throughout the lifetime is less than ±4%.
Opened Vial Stability of Control Solution: The measured glucose levels of 3 lots of
control solutions during the use lifetime period (3 months) are all within the specified
ranges (50 ± 15 mg/dL for low level, 110 ± 16.5 mg/dL for normal level, 300 ± 45
mg/dL for high level solutions), and the average bias with respect to the mean value
throughout the lifetime is less than ±0.7%.
The expected values of the glucose control solutions were established by testing the
solutions 5 times with YSI 2300. If the solutions are within the acceptance criteria,
the solutions are then tested 5 times on the Nova Biomedical Stat Profile M.
Solutions that pass these two QC checks are then tested 100 times on the candidate
device, and the reported range of the control solutions are based on the average of
these 100 tests.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the system is 20 - 600 mg/dL. This range was verified by the
linearity study (above section M.1.b.).
e. Analytical specificity:
Spiked whole blood samples containing 3 levels of glucose (low glucose at <60
mg/dL, normal glucose at 150 mg/dL, and high glucose at >300 mg/dL), with and
without interfering substances, were prepared to test common endogenous and
exogenous substances for interference. Each interferent was tested at five different
levels, in accordance with CLSI EP7-P. The highest levels tested for which no
interference was observed are summarized below:
Interferent (mg/dL)
Acetaminophen 20
Bilirubin 40
Gentistic Acid 50
Uric Acid 20

Cholesterol 500
Triglycerides 3000
Galactose 50
Xylose 10
Maltose 300
The acceptance criteria were as follows:
At <75 mg/dL samples, interferences over ± 15 mg/dL
At ≥75 mg/dL samples, interferences over ± 15 %
Interference testing showed that the candidate device results were within the
acceptance criteria at the above interferent concentrations. The sponsor states that
acetaminophen, uric acid, ascorbic acid, and other reducing substances do not
significantly affect results when occurring in normal blood or normal therapeutic
concentrations. However, an abnormally high concentration may cause inaccurately
high results. The sponsor also states that lipemic samples, with cholesterol up to 500
mg/dL or triglycerides up to 3000 mg/dL do not significantly affect results.
An altitude study was performed in an altitude simulation chamber with capillary
whole blood from volunteers which was then spiked to 3 levels (52, 153, and 352
mg/dL). The simulation chamber was set to 10,000 feet. The test data using capillary
blood samples using both meters showed that the bias versus YSI at 10,000 feet is the
same bias versus YSI as that observed at sea level. These data indicate no additional
effect due to altitude up to 10,000 feet.
To test the accuracy of the hematocrit effect, blood samples adjusted to hematocrit
levels of 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% and 60% at glucose concentrations of 40, 70, 110,
160, 260, 350, 450, and 550 mg/dL were tested a total of 15 times at each
concentration. The acceptance criteria were as follows:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To demonstrate the accuracy performance of the candidate device, trained specialists
tested the capillary blood samples from the finger of 160 patients (with samples
ranging from 38 to 496 mg/dL) and compared the results to the results from a
laboratory reference method (Hitachi 747) using samples taken at the same time.
*Samples with blood glucose levels below 50 mg/dL were obtained by glycolysis of
patient samples, and samples above 400 mg/dL were supplemented with glucose.
Results are summarized below:

The linear regression was Y = 0.9977x + 0.4729, R2 = 0.9832
Lay-user studies were also performed involving 150 individuals fluent in English at 3
clinical sites (50 users per site). Each participant was given a readability
questionnaire and draft labeling and instructions for the US market. No other
instruction was given. The participants performed their own fingersticks using the
G5 Infinity system. These results were then compared to fingerstick results obtained
by health care professionals within 5 minutes of the lay user test, also using the G5
Infinity. The acceptance criteria were as follows:
95% of the individual glucose results shall fall within ±15 mg/dL of the results of the
manufacturer's measurement procedure at glucose concentration <75mg/dL and
within 20% at glucose concentration (≥75mg/dL).
The results are as follows:

To demonstrate the accuracy performance of the candidate device using alternate
sites, a study was performed with lay users who read the user manual on their own,
without additional instruction on use of the device by technicians. Samples were
taken by the lay users from the fingertip, palm, upper arm, forearm, thigh, and calf
and were compared to the users fingerstick result. Samples ranged from 64 - 482
mg/dL. Results are summarized below for samples < 75 mg/dL being within ±15
