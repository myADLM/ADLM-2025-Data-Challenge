510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
K082248
B. Purpose for Submission:
Clearance of a modified cleared device
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Diagnostica Stago STA Satellite™ Automated Multi-Parametric Analyzer
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Coagulation
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The DSI STA Satellite™ is a fully automated bench-top system. Samples and test
reagents are loaded into the instrument where sample handling, reagent delivery,
analysis, and reporting or results are performed automatically.
The STA Satellite™ System consists of a cuvette, which holds patient sample and
any needed reagent ; a metal ball located in the cuvette that oscilates to measure
coagulation ; a needle that aspirates and dispenses sample and reagent into the
cuvette ; a camera to measure coagulation by chronometric method ; a light
source and sensor to transmit light through the cuvette and subsequently measure
the light absorbed; and application software.
2. Principles of Operation:
The STA Satellite™ system uses the well established photometric and
chronometric methods of detection. The photometric measurement is based on
measured absorbance of monochromatic light passing through the cuvette as
clotting takes place. The chronometric method consists of measuring variation of
the oscillation amplitude of the metal ball in the sample cuvette. A decrease in
amplitude corresponds to coagulation.
3. Modes of Operation:
1

Automated, Random access, Stat
4. Specimen Identification:
Specimens are identified by barcode and rack position.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Centrifuged, open tube samples are loaded onto a sample carousel. Tubes are
sampled by the instrument and loaded into the appropriate cuvette for assaying.
6. Calibration:
The STA Satellite™ automatically requires calibration for each lot of reagents
used. The calibration can be automatically validated if calibration controls are
used (user must define two control plasmas) or manually validated if control
values are outside the acceptable range.
7. Quality Control:
QC for each test is mandatory. User can use up to three control plasmas, one of
which must be defined. Control values outside a pre-determined range are
flagged by the system.

I. Special Control/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
Data comparing the STA Satellite™ was collected at 3 sites- 2 foreign sites
(one being the manufactures site) and 1 US site. Samples were obtained from
liver disease patients, patients on Coumadin therapy, unfractionated heparin
(UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) therapy and normal
outpatients.
Data was presented by site and pooled. Initial testing at the US site did not
meet acceptance criteria. Routine preventive maintenance was performed and
testing repeated which produced acceptable results.

c. Linearity:
A Fibrinogen reportable range of 150-900 mg/dl was demonstrated by testing
13 samples containing fibrinogen from 140 to 1040 mg/dl, on two STA
Satellite® analyzers. Percent recovery (STA Satellite value/expected value x
100%) varied from 94 – 105 % across the range of values.
An ATIII reportable range of up to 140% for the photometric ATIII assay was
demonstrated by testing 13 samples containing 0 to 153% ATIII, on two STA
Satellite® analyzers. Percent recovery (STA Satellite value/expected value x
100%) varied from 84 – 105 % across the range of values.
Unfractionated Heparin (UFH) linearity of up to 0.70 anti-Xa IU/ml for the
UFH assay was demonstrated by testing 13 samples containing 0 to 0.75
IU/ml UFH, on two STA Satellite® analyzers. Percent recovery (STA
Satellite value/expected value x 100%) varied from 89 to 110%.
A D-Dimer reportable range of 0.0 -4.0 µg/ml was demonstrated by testing 14
samples containing from 0 -4 µg/ml of d-dimer, on two STA Satellite®
analyzers. Percent recovery (STA Satellite value/expected value x 100%)
varied from 93 – 105 % across the range of values.
Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) linearity of up to 2.0 anti-Xa IU/ml
was demonstrated by testing samples containing 0 to 2.40 anti-Xa IU/ml of
LMWH on two STA Satellite® analyzers. Percent recovery (STA Satellite
value/expected value x 100%) varied from 92 to 103%.
d. Carryover:
Sample to sample carry-over was evaluated on three STA Satellite™
analyzers. A normal human plasma pool was prepared and divided into two
portions. 10 IU of UFH was added to one portion which caused the APTT
value to be >100 secs. The heparinized pool was tested five times followed
by the normal pool. This cycle was repeated five times. The APTT values of
the normal pool remained unaffected by the heparinized pool, demonstrating
the lack of sample-to-sample carryover.
