L. Test Principle:
MA reagent is used to measure the albumin concentration by a turbidimetric method.
In the reaction, albumin combines with specific antibody to form insoluble antigen-
antibody complexes. The Synchron System(s) automatically proportions the
appropriate sample and reagent volumes into the cuvette. The ratio used is one part
sample to 24 parts reagent. The system monitors the change in absorbance at 380

nanometers. This change in absorbance is proportional to the concentration of
albumin in the sample and is used by the system to calculate and express albumin
concentration based upon a non-linear calibration curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Analytical performance was demonstrated on the CX4 CE system.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were designed according to the CLSI EP05-A guideline.
Three levels of urine control materials were measured twice a day in
duplicates for 20 days (N=80). The results are summarized below:
Synchron CX4:
Sample Mean Within-run Total S.D. Within-run Total
ID (mg/dL) S.D. (mg/dL) (mg/dL) (CV %) (CV %)
Level 1 0.8 0.08 0.13 9.7 16.3
Level 2 3.0 0.14 0.23 4.5 7.5
Level 3 40.1 0.42 0.59 1.0 1.5
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed measuring range for the device is 0.2-30mg/dL.
Linearity studies were designed according to the CLSI EP06-A guideline. A
high patient urine sample was used to prepare 7 different levels of
microalbumin concentration. All samples were measured 4 times on the
CX4CE analyzer. Concentration of samples ranged from 0.2 mg/dL to 30
mg/dL (0.2, 0.3, 0.45, 0.6, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30). An appropriate line
was fitted by standard linear regression and the following slope and R2
measurements were obtained.

Extended measuring range studies (ORDAC) were performed using 8
concentrations ranging from 20- 100 mg/dL (20, 25, 30, 40, 60, 80 and 100).
The sponsor claimed that the reportable range is 0.2 to 30 mg/dL and the extended range is 24 to 9

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The SYNCHRON CX® Systems MA Calibrator (six levels) is designed for
use on the SYNCHRON CX Systems. Calibrators are traceable to the IFCC

reference preparation for plasma proteins, BCR-470. Traceability process is
based on EN ISO 17511. Traceability statements for the calibrator are
included in the instructions for use included with the calibrator kit.
Calibrators are stable between +2°C to +8°C until date of expiration.
Exposure of Urine Protein Calibrator to temperatures greater than 32°C (90°F)
may adversely affect performance. Once opened, the reagent is stable for 60
days unless the expiration date is exceeded. Users are instructed to not freeze
the reagent.
d. Detection limit:
Studies on limit of detection were performed according to CLSI EP17
guideline. Limit of blank (LoB) and Limit of detection(LoD) were determined
by using saline (0 mg/dL), protein free urine (0 mg/dL), diluted urine protein
control (0.2 mg/dL) and diluted urine protein control (0.3 mg/dL). All
samples were run in 10 replicates over a period of six days on the CX4CE
analyzer. Limit of Blank (LoB) is less than 0.1 mg/dL. The Limit of
Detection (LoD) was calculated using the mean and SD for the low sample
measurements:
LoD = LoB + 1.653 * SD
The Limit of Detection (LoD) is less than 0.2 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were designed according to the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline.
Three levels of patient samples or pools were spiked with the known
interference substances and analyzed on the Sychron CX 4 CE analyzer. No
significant interference was defined as the observed value for Microalbumin
values ≤ 2.3 mg/dL is ≤± 0.25 mg/dL and values > 2.3 mg/dL is < 10.8%
difference of the expected value (neat sample). The sponsor claimed that there
was no significant interference (<10.8% or ≤± 0.25 mg/dL) by the following
interferents:
• Ascorbic acid to 500 mg/dL
• Calcium up to 130 mg/dL
• Citrate up to 50 mg/dL
• Creatinine up to 160 mg/dL
• Glucose up to 200 mg/dL
• Magnesium up to 400 mg/dL
• Oxalate up to 30 mg/dL
• Urea up to 140 mg/dL
The sponsor has the following limitations in the labeling:
• Do not use turbid samples. Samples should be centrifuged before
testing if they have debris in them.

• Do not use samples contaminated with blood.
• If serum proteins carryover is suspected, a saline sample should be
assayed prior to assaying the patient samples.
