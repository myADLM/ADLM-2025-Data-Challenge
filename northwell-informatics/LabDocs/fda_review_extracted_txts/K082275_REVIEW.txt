L. Test Principle:
A1c: The CLOVER A1c™ system is a fully automated boronate affinity assay for the
determination of the percentage of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c %) in whole blood. The HbA1c
Test Cartridge includes a Cartridge and a reagent pack. The reagent pack is pre-filled with
reaction solution and washing solution. The reaction solution contains agents that lyse
erythrocytes and bind hemoglobin specifically, as well as a boronate resin that binds cis-diols
of glycated hemoglobin. A blood sample size of (4μl) is obtained with the collection area of
the reagent pack. The blood is instantly lysed releasing the hemoglobin and the boronate
resin binding the glycated hemoglobin. The cartridge is inserted into the CLOVER A1c™
analyzer. The blood sample mixture is rotated to the measurement zone of the cartridge,
where the amount of total hemoglobin in the blood sample is measured by the reflectance of
the photo sensor LED (Light Emitting Diode) and PD (Photo Diode).
The cartridge is then rotated so that the washing solution washes out non-glycated
hemoglobin from the blood sample, thus the amount of glycated hemoglobin can be
photometrically measured. The ratio of glycated hemoglobin with respect to total hemoglobin
in the blood sample is calculated.
Glucose: The CLOVER A1cTM blood glucose test is based on the measurement of glucose
concentration in human blood. The principle of the test is based on the reaction between
Page 3 of 12

--- Page 4 ---
glucose in the blood sample, glucose oxidase and hexaammineruthenium (III) chloride. The
resulting product generates a current that is proportional to the glucose concentration in the
sample. The test strip employs an electrochemical signal generating an electrical current that
will stimulate a chemical reaction. The reaction is measured and displayed by the analyzer.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A1c Linearity: A linearity study across the entire claimed measuring range (4.0 -
14.0%) was evaluated using low (2.9% HbA1c) and high (16.7% HbA1c) patient
samples. The low and high patient samples were mixed together in varying ratios to
make nine intermediate levels. The samples were run in triplicate on two Clover A1c
analyzers. The observed mean values were compared to the theoretical values based
upon the dilution factor. The % recovery was calculated with the following formula:
Recovery = Observed %HbA1c value / Expected %HbA1c value x 100. The percent
recovery between the observed values verses the expected values are shown in the
table below.

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed that the Hb A1c assay is linear
from 4.0% to 14.0%
Glucose linearity: The sponsor evaluated linearity of the device using a protocol
based on CLSI EP6-A. EDTA venous blood sample was spiked to two concentrations
(high and low). The two concentrations were mixed from 14 glucose concentrations
between 7.4 to 628.0 mg/dL (confirmed by YSI) then tested with the CLOVER A1c
glucose module and YSI. The CLOVER A1c analyzer displays “Low” with glucose
values below 20mg/dL, “HI” with glucose values over 600 mg/dL. Each glucose level
was measured 5 times by the CLOVER A1c glucose module and in duplicate by YSI.

Regression analysis showed a linear relationship between the CLOVER A1c glucose
module and the YSI method: y=1.0004 x+0.5273, R2=0.9999. For all values between
20 and 600 mg/dL, the percent difference between the observed value on the
CLOVER and the 1st order value were all less than 3%.
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed that the glucose assay is linear
from 20-600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Clover A1c device has been certified by the National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program (NGSP). NGSP certifications are renewed annually. Current
NGSP certifications are found on the web at http://www.ngsp.org/prog/index.html
Glucose assay is traceable to the YSI method by method comparison. Stability for
glucose controls was established in k051285.
d. Detection limit:
A1c - The reportable range for the assay is 4.0 to 14.0% HbA1c. See section 1. b,
linearity/reportable range above.
Glucose - The detection limit is 20 mg/dL. See linearity/assay reportable range above.
e. Analytical specificity:
A1c Interference: Interference testing was performed using a protocol based on CLSI
EP7-A. Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could
interfere with the Clover A1c device. The interfering substances were evaluated in
normal (5.2%) and abnormal (9.5%) samples. Two levels of EDTA whole blood
sample pools were spiked with interfering substance. The sponsor states that recovery
within 10% of the control results was considered to be non-significant. The following
compounds, at the levels indicated, were shown to have no significant interference on
the Clover A1c test results: Acetaminophen: 20mg/dL, Bilirubin: 40mg/dL,
Acetylsalicylic acid: 60mg/dL Caffeine: 6mg/dL, Glyburide: 0.19mg/dL, Ascorbic
acid: 6mg/dL, Hydroxyzine dihydrochloride: 30mg/dL, Triglyceride: 3000 mg/dL,
and Urea: 500 mg/dL.
To evaluate the effect of labile glycated hemoglobin and Hemoglobin variants (S, C,
D, E, and F), two EDTA whole blood samples representing normal and abnormal A1c
levels were split into aliquots. The samples were treated with various concentration of
glucose (200-1000 mg/dL for 3 hours at 37℃), producing labile HbA1c. Hemoglobin
variants were tested using samples provided by the NGSP known to contain variants
S, C, D, E, and F. Control samples were prepared in the same manner, but were
treated with an equal volume of diluents used to prepare the glucose stock solution in
place of the 450 mg/dL glucose stock solution. The sponsor states recovery within
10% of the control sample was considered to be non-significant interfering.
Page 7 of 12

--- Page 8 ---
Based on the data, the sponsor claims no significant interference for labile glycated
hemoglobin and Hb S, C, D, E,and F.
NGSP has hemoglobin variants interference information for methods at
http://www.ngsp.org/prog/index.html
Glucose Interference: Common interferences were evaluated by spiking venous blood
with glucose to three concentrations based on CLSI EP7-P of low (less than 60
mg/dL), normal (110 mg/dL), and high (greater than 350 mg/dL). The glucose
samples were spiked with the potentially interfering compounds and run in replicates
of 5. Bias was calculated as the mean percent difference in glucose reading between
the test and control concentration groups. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion was
<±10% difference to be considered as no significant interference. Based on the data,
the sponsor claims no significant interference for the substances and concentrations
shown in the table below:

Glucose Hematocrit Study - The sponsor performed hematocrit studies comparing the
Clover device result at various hematocrits (20, 30, 40 and 51%) across the glucose
measuring range to the Clover device at a normal hematocrit and to a YSI 2300 analyzer.
Page 8 of 12

--- Page 9 ---
All of the comparisons to the reference analyzer and to a normal hematocrit showed a
bias within +/- 10 mg/dL for values < 75 mg/dL and +/-10% for values ≥75 mg/dL.
Glucose Altitude Study – A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of altitude on the
Clover device. Venous blood was collected from volunteers and allowed to undergo
glycolysis at room temperature to lower the endogenous glucose to approximately 40
mg/dL. Glucose values ranging from 42 mg/dL to 550 mg/dL were measured by
Clover A1c glucose device in the altitude chamber at sea level and 10,000 feet
conditions. The glucose values were confirmed with the YSI glucose analyzer. The
meter readings obtained at 10,000 feet were compared to the meter readings at sea level
and the % bias was determined at each level. Results recovered within ± 15 mg/dL at
blood glucose levels of < 75 mg/dL and ± 15% at glucose levels > 75 mg/dL when
compared to the readings near sea level. The labeling states that the Clover device can be
used at elevations up to, but not higher than 10,000 feet above sea level.

venous whole blood patient samples in three point of care sites (POC) sites by 9
intended users (three at each site). The testing was performed by comparing the
venous whole blood results of 150 samples (50 at each site) that spanned the claimed
assay range to the results obtained by the predicate, DCA vantage. Samples ranged
from 4.3% -13.6% as measured by the predicate. 150 capillary samples were then

b. Matrix comparison:
A1c: Venous whole blood samples (EDTA, heparin, citrate and fluoride/oxalate)
collected from 25 donors were assayed on the Clover A1c and compared to the predicate
(DCA Vantage). Fingertip capillary whole blood samples were then collected and
compared to the results obtained on the DCA vantage. Samples ranged from 4.0 -14.0%.
The results of the studies are presented below:
Heparin vs EDTA Citrate vs EDTA fluoride/oxalate vs EDTA
y = 0.9999x - 0.0715 y = 0.9914x + 0.0726 y = 0.999x + 0.0008

A1c: The sponsor concluded that the following anti-coagulants can be used with their
A1c device: EDTA, heparin, citrate, and fluoride/oxalate.
Glucose: Not applicable; the Glucose device is only indicated for capillary whole blood.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The hemoglobin A1c Expected Value Range is cited from literature (American Diabetes
Association. Standards of Medical Care for Patients with Diabetes Mellitus. Diabetes
Care 2001, 24 (Suppl. 1), 33-43). Hemoglobin A1c > 8% Action is suggested.
Hemoglobin A1c < 7% is the goal. Hemoglobin A1c < 6% is non-diabetic level.
Glucose Expected Value Range is cited from the literature (American Diabetes
Association Clinical Practice Recommendations 2004, Diabetes Care Supplement 1, p.
S9.)
The normal fasting adult glucose range for a non-diabetic is 70 – 105 mg/dL. One to two
hours after a meal, normal blood glucose levels should be less than 140 mg/dL
N. Instrument Name:
Clover A1c Analyzer for measuring Hemoglobin A1c and Glucose
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each A1c cartridge and each glucose test strip is single use and must be replaced with a
new cartridge or strip for additional readings. The user performs the A1c and glucose
assays by following the prompts on the Analyzer display.
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer?
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer using wireless transmission?:
Yes _____or No ___X .

2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test cartridge or test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger.
Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no special
handling or storage issues for glucose.
The A1c device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger and
venous whole blood samples. Acceptable anticoagulants are EDTA, heparin, citrate and
fluoride/oxalate, and these blood samples may be stored at - 94 ºF to 41ºF for two weeks
or up to 77 º F for one week. Stored blood should be whole blood, not as hemolysate.
Allow blood samples to reach room temperature, 68 - 77ºF. Anti-coagulated blood should
be mixed well prior to testing.
5. Calibration:
For glucose, a color tag on the back of the test strips provides lot specific calibration
information. The analyzer automatically read and displays the strip code on the screen.
The user must check to make sure that the strip code on the bottle matches with the strip
code displays on the analyzer before assaying any glucose test. No calibration by the
user is required.
The A1c assay is factory calibrated. No calibration by the user is required.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at three different concentrations can be assayed with this device
and are sold with the kit. When a test strip is inserted into the glucose test module, the
control mode can be activated. This prevents control results from being stored in the
internal memory. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip
vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the module if the control result falls outside
these ranges. For A1c, two levels of commercially available A1c controls are
recommended in the labeling.
P. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
Q. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
