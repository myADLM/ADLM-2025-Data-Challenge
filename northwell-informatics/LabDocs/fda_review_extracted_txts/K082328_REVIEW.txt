L. Test Principle:
The GlucoDr Plus system is based on measurement of electrical currents caused by the
reaction of glucose with reagents on the gold electrode strip. Glucose in the blood sample
reacts with FAD glucose dehydrogenase and potassium ferricyanide in the test strip, which
creates electrical currents. The subsequent electrical currents are proportional to the glucose
concentration in the blood and converted to the equivalent glucose concentration by the
algorithm programmed in the test meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed precision studies using venous whole blood with
concentrations between 30 and 400 mg/dL (spiked samples). Testing was performed
at 3 sites with 10 meters (3 meters used at site 1 and 2 and 4 meters at site 3) and
three lots of test strips were tested with 10 replicates in one day. The results for all
three lots are presented in the table below:
Level Mean of glucose Within-run (SD) %CV
(mg/dL)
1 41.4 2.52 6.08
2 92.4 2.22 2.40
3 132 3.50 2.65
4 216.6 4.13 1.91
5 329.8 9.03 2.74
In addition, a repeatability of the test strip was tested with control solutions (low,
medium and high). Testing was performed at 3 sites with 10 meters (3 meters used at
site 1 and 2 and 4 meters at site 3) and three lots of test strips were tested with 10
replicates in one day. The results for all three lots are presented in the table below:
Glucose Mean of glucose Total imprecision Total %

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the glucose measurements was demonstrated by comparing prepared
blood samples on the GlucoDr test system and a glucose reference method. The
seventeen samples ranged in concentration from a low of approximately 20 mg/dL to
a high of approximately 600 mg/dL. Three GlucoDr meters and three lots of blood
glucose test strips were tested in replicates of three. Linear regression of the
comparison data yielded the following relationship:
Lot 1 - y = 0.9961x – 2.0089, R2 = 0.9987
Lot 2 – y = 1.0003x – 1.0572, R2 = 0.9986
Lot 3 – y = 0.9909x – 0.4008, R2 = 0.9985
The reportable range for glucose measurements is 20-600 mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The test strip and control solution stability was assessed by performing real-time and
accelerated studies for the shelf life and in use stability. Stability protocols and
acceptance criteria were evaluated and found to be acceptable. The claimed shelf life
is 18 months and the claimed in-use stability is 90 days for control solution and 4
months for the test strips when stored between 8 – 30 ºC.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity/reportable range studies above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous and exogenous substances were tested for interference on this assay at
three glucose concentration (53, 152 and 255 mg/dL). Two test strip lots and 4 meters
were used in the study. The sponsor defined interference as a change in glucose
measurement from the control greater than 10 mg/dL for glucose concentration <75
mg/dL and greater than 10% for glucose concentration >75 mg/dL. The following
substances were tested.

All substances tested except for the ones listed below show no interference at the
concentrations tested. The sponsor notes in the labeling that the following substances
may affect the test results above concentrations tested; Acetaminophen >6 mg/dL,
Ascorbic Acid >4 mg/dL, Total bilirubin >4 mg/dL, Triglycerides >300 mg/dL and
Uric acid >10 mg/dL.
Hematocrit study:
The effect of hematocrit was evaluated in a study using samples with 5 glucose
concentrations (40-60, 80-120, 150-200, 250-300, and 350-450 mg/dL) and varying
hematocrit levels from 20 - 60%. Each glucose level/hematocrit combination was tested
on 5 meters using 3 lots of test strips, by comparing the results of samples at each of the
varying hematocrit levels to the sample of the same glucose concentration at a normal
(40%) hematocrit level. Each glucose level/hematocrit combination was also compared to
the corresponding YSI value. The data supports the sponsor’s claimed hematocrit range
of 20-60%

Altitude study:
An altitude study was performed with four whole blood samples spiked to the following
concentration 80-120, 180-200, 280-320 and 380-420 mg/dL. The samples were tested at
ground level up to 8,200 feet. All samples met the sponsor’s acceptability criterion of the
difference between the minimum and maximum result at each concentration range is <
10%. The data submitted supports use of the device up to 8,200 feet.
Temperature and humidity studies were performed and showed that the meter can be
used at temperatures from 2-40° C and at a relative humidity from 36 to 85%

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The consumer study was performed at three POC sites with a total of 130 lay-users.
The lay-users ranged in age, education and were about equally divided between males
and females. Each participant performed their own fingerstick and tested their blood
using the instructions in the User’s manual and package insert. A trained professional
then performed another fingerstick and tested the blood on the same meter. Blood was
collected and measured on an YSI analyzer.

23 Lithium Heparin venous blood samples were assayed in triplicate on the GlucoDR
Plus meter and the YSI using two strip lots. Samples ranged from 40-400 mg/dL. The
resulting linear regressions obtained when using the first sample on each lot are as
follows: Lot 1 – Y = 1.011X + 0.4002, r2 = 0.9987 and Lot 2 – Y = 0.9861X + 3.13,
r2 = 0.9973. System accuracy results for the first glucose sample met the ISO criteria
of < 75 mg/dL with + 10 mg/dL and > 75 mg/dL within 20%. All subsequent
replicates met the ISO criteria also.

2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ____X___ or No ________
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes _______ or No __X____
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes _______ or No __X____
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip, palm,
forearm or thigh and venous whole blood. For capillary whole blood, since the sample is
applied directly to the test strip there are no special handling or storage issues. For EDTA
and lithium heparin venous whole blood samples must be tested within 15 minutes of
draw and the sample should not be stored.
5. Calibration:
Each bottle of test strips has a code number which is used to calibrate the meter. The code
number must be verified by turning on the meter using the power button. The code
number can not be changed with a test strip inserted into the port. The user confirms that
the code number on the test strip bottle matches the code number in the instrument. If
they are different then the user changes the number by depressing the power button. The
user looks for the code number to begin flashing than releases the power button, this
should take approximately one second. Next, the user uses the up/down buttons to adjust
the code to the correct number. To save the correct code number the user presses the
power button. No further calibrations are required of the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor is providing two levels of control solution with this device. To mark the test
result as a control, after the test result is displayed the user is instructed to press the
up/down buttons to select the attention event icon. After the attention event icon appears
