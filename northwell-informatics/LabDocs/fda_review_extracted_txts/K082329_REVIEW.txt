H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Viramed Biotech AG Borrelia B31 IgM ViraStripe® is an in vitro qualitative
assay for the detection of IgM antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi in human
serum. It is intended for use in the testing of human serum samples which have
been found positive or equivocal using an EIA or IFA test procedure for B.
burgdorferi antibodies.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Viramed Biotech AG Borrelia B31 IgM ViraStripe® is an in vitro qualitative
assay for the detection of IgM antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi in human
serum. It is intended for use in the testing of human serum samples which have
been found positive or equivocal using an EIA or IFA test procedure for B.
burgdorferi antibodies. Positive results from this line blot assay are supportive
evidence of infection with B. burgdorferi, the causative agent for Lyme disease.
The Viramed Biotech AG Borrelia B31 IgM ViraStripe® can be used during the
acute phase (0-4 weeks of symptoms onset) of B. burgdorferi infection. Patients
who are positive by IgM but not IgG should have the test repeated a few weeks
later if they remain ill. If they are still positive only by IgM and have been ill
longer than one month, this is likely a false positive.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
None
I. Device Description:
The Viramed Biotech AG Borrelia B31 IgM ViraStripe® is a line blot assay to
detect IgM to individual B. burgdorferi antigens. Isolated cultures of B.
burgdorferi B31 spirochetes were harvested, concentrated, washed, and
extracted to produce antigen fractions. Antigens were purified by
electrophoretic and chromatographic methodologies and line striped on a
nitrocellulose membrane. B. burgdorferi antigens are bound and fixed to the
solid phase nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane is blocked, dried and
cut into individual test strips.
For each test to be performed, the line blot strip and diluted test serum is added to
a line blot strip well. If specific antibodies that recognize an antigen are present,
they will bind to the specific antigens on the strip. After incubation the line blot
2

--- Page 3 ---
strip is washed to remove unbound antibodies. Alkaline-phosphatase anti-human
IgM conjugate is then added to each strip and incubated. If antibody is present,
the conjugate will bind to the antibody attached to the specific antigens. The strip
is washed to remove unbound conjugate and the substrate solution is added. If the
enzyme/antibody complex is present, the substrate will undergo a precipitation
and color change. After an incubation period, the reaction is stopped and the
presence of precipitated substrate is visualized at specific locations on the strip.
The presence of a colored precipitation at various locations on the line blot strip is
an indirect measurement of Borrelia burgdorferi specific antibodies in the patient
specimen. A uniform band locator is given on the evaluation protocol and used to
locate and identify specific Borrelia burgdorferi B31 antibodies on the line blot
test strip. Every strip has an integrated control system including function control
and conjugate control. Visualized bands from the reaction are compared for
intensity with a separate strip containing the Cut-off control band for evaluation.
Any band found having a visual intensity equal to or greater than the Cut-off
control band intensity is considered as a significant band.
Positivity: The criteria for a positive Western blot result defined by the CDC
are followed. For B. burgdorferi IgM positivity, the blot should be positive
for at least 2 of the 3 protein bands: p41, p39, p23kDa

at the three sites assessed the Western blot bands from the same master lot

Cross-Reactivity
Seventy-five sera determined to contain antibodies to other infectious disease
agents were tested. Cross-reactivity data for Ehrlichia chafeensis and Babesia
microti may represent an actual co-infection with B. burgdorferi. All three
tick borne organisms have been found to reside in the geographic location
from which these 15 clinical specimens were obtained. Both of the specimens
found positive in the Viramed Biotech AG Borrelia B31 IgM ViraStripe®
were also found to be positive in a commercially available Lyme Western blot
test system. Potential cross-reactivity due to circulating antibodies from
infections with Treponema phagedenis, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus
influenza, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria

INTERFERING SUBSTANCES
The following substances had an effect on test results when present in sera:
hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric sera and should not be used for testing.
Because the firm did not test any sera from patients with immune-deficient
diseases, elevated bilirubin, triglycerides, and heat-inactivated sera, the
following statements will be added to the package insert: “The performance of
this assay when testing sera from patients with any immune-deficient diseases
such as HIV, HTLV, etc. and sera from patients that have had immune-
suppressive therapy with drugs or medications is not known because no
studies were conducted to assess the performance. Do not use heat-
inactivated sera. Sera with elevated bilirubin, and triglycerides were not
tested.
