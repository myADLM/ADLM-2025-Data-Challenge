Methods
L. Test Principle:
Serum samples:
First, the serum sample is incubated with the folate pretreatment reagents to release
bound folate from endogenous folate binding proteins. Then, the pretreated sample is
incubated with the ruthenium labeled folate binding protein and a folate complex is
formed, the amount of which is dependent upon the analyte concentration in the
sample. Next, streptavidin-coated microparticles and folate labeled with biotin are
added and the unbound sites of the ruthenium labeled folate binding protein become
occupied, with formation of a ruthenium labeled folate binding protein-folate biotin
complex. The entire complex is bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and
streptavidin. The reaction mixture is then aspirated into the measuring cell where the
microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound
substances are washed away and application of a voltage to the electrode induces
chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier. Results are
determined via a calibration curve.
Whole blood samples:
Whole blood treated with anticoagulants (heparin or EDTA) is diluted with ascorbic
acid solution and incubated. Lysis of the erythrocytes takes place releasing the
intracellular folate. The hemolysate is then used as a “pre-diluted” sample
(analogously to serum) for subsequent measurement in the Elecsys Folate III assay.
The hematocrit value determined in whole blood and the dilution effect brought about
by pretreatment of the sample is to be taken into account when calculating the
erythrocyte folate concentration.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the Elecsys Folate III was evaluated on the Elecsys
2010/cobas e411 Immunoassay analyzer. Serum linearity was determined by
diluting three high analyte level serum patient samples. Samples 1 & 2 were
diluted with Elecsys Universal Diluent and Sample 3 was diluted with low
analyte level serum. Mixtures of 10 different concentrations of folate were
tested. The expected values were generated using the concentrations measured
in the diluted and the undiluted patient sample and then applying the dilution
factors. The percent recovery was determined by dividing the measured
concentration with the expected concentration. The sample concentrations
tested ranged from 20 ng/mL to 1.19 ng/mL. All of the results were within ≤
0.75 ng/mL for results ≤ 5 ng/mL and ≤15% for results greater than 5 ng/mL.
The results demonstrated that the assay was linear across the claimed
measuring range of 1.5 to 20 ng/mL.
RBC linearity was determined by diluting one high level RBC hemolysate
sample to concentrations evenly spaced across the measuring range. Eleven
concentrations across the measuring range were tested. The linearity data
were analyzed with regards to linear, quadratic and cubic polynomials. In a
first step, a linearity check was performed with a first order (linear) regression
and then with higher order models (quadratic and cubic). The result has shown
that higher orders are not significant. The sample concentrations tested
ranged from 0 ng/mL to 653 ng/mL. All of the results were within the
sponsors acceptance criteria and demonstrated that the assay was linear across
the claimed measuring range of 46.5 to 620 ng/mL. The analyzer calculates
this value by automatically correcting for the 1:31 pre-dilution that occurs
during the hemolysis step.
This assay has a measuring range of 1.5- 20 ng/dL for serum folate and 46.5-
620 ng/dL for RBC folate.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The CalSet, CalCheck and the PreciControl Anemia products are assayed and
compared to Roche master calibrators, which are traceable to an in-house
standard, and target values and ranges are assigned. Values are assigned using
multiple Elecsys® 2010/ cobas e® 411 analyzers. Several runs are performed
on each analyzer platform with duplicate determinations for each sample. The
target value is then calculated as the median of the determined values.
Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be
7

--- Page 8 ---
acceptable. The CalSet, CalCheck, and PreciControl Anemia are stable until the
expiration date printed on the vial when stored unopened at 2 – 8° C.
Reconstituted CalSet vials are stable for 5 hours at 20 - 25°C, 3 days at 2 – 8°C,
and 3 months at -20°C. Reconstituted CalCheck vials are stable for 4 hours at 20
- 25°C. PreciControl Anemia vials are stable for 8 hours at 20 - 25°C, 5 hours on
the analyzers at 20 - 25°C, 3 days at 2 – 8°C, and 3 months at -20°C.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LOB) and Limit of Detection (LOD) were determined in
accordance with CLSI EP17-A requirements. One human serum sample pool,
free of analyte, was used in the LOB experiment. Five low-level human serum
samples were used in the LOD experiment. Analyte levels were determined by
testing on the Elecsys 2010/cobas e411 Immunoassay analyzer. Each of these
samples was evaluated n=60 on multiple runs over 3 days on multiple
analyzers and reagent lots. The Limit of Blank was determined as the 95th
percentile of measurements of blank samples. In this case, after a top-down
ranking of the 60 measured concentrations, the mean of the concentrations at
position #57 and #58 = LoB = (0.632 + 0.634)/2 = 0.633 ng/mL. The LoB
claim in the package insert is 0.640 ng/mL. The LOD was calculated as LOD
= LOB + 1.6529 x SD total = 0.633 + 1.6529 x 0.2827 = 1.10 ng/mL. In the
labeling, Roche claims an LoD of ≤ 1.5 ng/mL.
For calculating the limit of quantitation (LOQ), two human serum samples
and three human serum sample pools (folate depleted) with concentrations
ranging from 1.20 to 3.16 ng/mL were used to calculate the concentration
which corresponds to an interassay coefficient of variation (CV) of 20%. The
samples were tested once per day, for 10 days. The mean, standard deviation
and coefficient of variation for each sample were calculated. As a result, by
linear interpolation, a concentration of approximately 1.8 ng/mL generated a
CV of 20 %. The sponsor claims a functional sensitivity for the device of 2
ng/mL.
The lower end to the RBC measuring range is defined as 46.5 ng/mL in the
Package Insert. This concentration is derived from the serum/plasma Folate
claimed LoD of 1.5 ng/mL (and dilution effect x31). Roche performed a
functional sensitivity study. The study was performed using hemolysates on
the Elecsys® 2010 / cobas e® 411 Immunoassay Analyzer. Eight
hemolysates with concentrations ranging from 29.5 to 210 ng/mL were tested
for 5 days, 2 runs per in singleton. The mean, standard deviation and
coefficient of variation for each sample were calculated. As a result, a
concentration of 54.8 ng/mL generated a CV of 15.8 %. The claimed
functional sensitivity of 2 ng/mL for serum/plasma Folate III would
correspond to a calculated value of 62 ng/mL for RBC Folate (based on the
dilution effect x31).
This assay has a measuring range of 1.5- 20 ng/dL for serum folate and 46.5-
8

--- Page 9 ---
620 ng/dL for rbc folate.
e. Analytical specificity:
The effects of interference by Biotin, Lipemia, Bilirubin, Rheumatoid Factor,
Human IgG and Human IgA on the quantitation of Folate by the Elecsys
Folate III assay were determined on the Elecsys 2010/cobas e411
Immunoassay Analyzer. Human serum samples, spiked with varying levels of
interferent, were divided into two aliquots after collection. One aliquot was
spiked with the interferent while the other aliquot was spiked with the same
volume diluent. The interferent spiked sample was then diluted into the
unspiked aliquot in 10% increments. Percent recovery was calculated by
comparing the measured folate concentration to the expected folate initial
concentration. The sponsor defined significant interference as greater than +/-
0.5 ng/mL, absolute deviation for samples </= 5 ng/mL and greater than +/-
10% recovery for samples >5 ng/mL. The following results were obtained
Endogenous Substances Concentration Showing No
Interference
Bilirubin 33 mg/dL
Biotin 21 ng/mL
Intralipid 1500 mg/dL
IgG 16 g/L
IgA 4 g/L
The labeling states the following regarding hemoglobin interference:
Hemolysis may significantly increase folate values due to high concentrations
of folate in red blood cells. Therefore, hemolyzed serum samples are not
suitable for use in this assay.
18 commonly used pharmaceuticals were examined for potential effect on
folate determination by the Folate III test system. Each drug was added to
folate serum samples in two defined concentrations and the resulting samples
were tested in triplicate using the Elecsys 2010/cobas e411 Immunoassay
Analyzer. The median value was compared to the reference value (folate
sample with no drug added) and the deviation from the reference value was
calculated. The sponsor defined interference as +/- 3SD of the reference value
or +/- 10% if the 3SD range < +/- 10%. The results showed not significant
interference at the concentrations below.
