I. Device Description:
The VITEK® 2 AST card containing the test is inoculated with a standardized
organism suspension. The card is incubated within the instrument and optically
monitored throughout the incubation cycle. Results are automatically calculated once a
predetermined growth threshold is reached and a report is generated that contains the
final result.

Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
Optics systems use visible light to directly measure organism growth. These
transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant
growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure
organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through the well. An
interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a “rapid” read but may be extended
to 18 hours in some instances. The VITEK®2 Susceptibility Card test is based on the
microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration technique with concentrations
equivalent to standard method concentrations. Several parameters based on the growth
characteristics observed are used to provide appropriate input for the MIC calculations.
Discriminate analysis is used to develop the algorithm that determines the susceptibility
result for all antimicrobials on the VITEK®2 system. The MIC result must be linked to
organism identification in order to determine a category interpretation. A category
interpretation (SIR) will be reported along with a MIC.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
4. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Ten gram negative isolates were tested at three sites in triplicate
for three days using both the manual dilution and the automatic
dilution method. These same organisms were tested at one site
three times to determine within site reproducibility of >95% also.
This testing was performed using both the manual dilution of the
inoculum and also the automatic dilution method.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
The FDA recommended quality control (QC) isolates, P.
aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and E. coli ATCC 25922 were tested at
each study site by the reference method and the VITEK®2. The
reference method QC results were in range for every day tested.
The VITEK®2 was tested a sufficient number of times to
demonstrate that the system can produce QC results in the
recommended range.
Quality Control was performed during the studies using both auto-
dilution and the manual dilution method.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A clinical study was conducted at three external sites using the
VITEK®2 gram negative doripenem and the broth microdilution method as
recommended by CLSI. Inoculum was prepared with direct colony suspension
and incubated in ambient air at 35 ±2 °C for 16 – 20 hours. The testing
included both fresh clinical isolates and stock isolates along with a challenge set
with known results. Two methods of inoculation (manual and automated) were
evaluated. Clinical testing was performed using the automated method of
inoculation and the challenge set was tested using both the manual and the

EA is when there is agreement between the reference method and the new method is within
plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of antibiotic. Category agreement (CA) is when
the new method result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result
interpretation. Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the new method
and the reference method and have on-scale EA.

The challenge set of organisms was also tested at one site using the manual method of
inoculation with the following performance that demonstrated a minimal difference between the
two inoculation methods.
