The GemLyte is an automated, microprocessor-controlled analyzer which utilizes ion-
selective electrodes for the measurement of sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium and
lithium in whole blood, plasma and serum, and prediluted urine samples.
The GemLyte Potassium Assay is intended to measure potassium in whole blood, plasma,

device are used to monitor electrolyte balance in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases
conditions characterized by low or high blood potassium levels.
The GemLyte Sodium Assay is intended to measure sodium in whole blood, plasma,
serum, and urine on the GemLyte Electrolyte Analyzer. Measurements obtained by this
device are used to monitor electrolyte balance in the diagnosis and treatment of
aldosteronism (excessive secretion of the hormone aldosterone), diabetes insipidus
(chronic excretion of large amounts of dilute urine, accompanied by extreme thirst),
adrenal hypertension, Addison's disease (caused by destruction of the adrenal glands),
dehydration, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, or other diseases involving
electrolyte imbalance.

The GemLyte Chloride Assay is intended to measure the level of chloride in whole
blood, plasma, serum, and urine. Chloride measurements are used in the diagnosis and
treatment of electrolyte and metabolic disorders such as cystic fibrosis and diabetic
acidosis.
The GemLyte Calcium Assay is intended to measure the ionized calcium level in whole
blood, plasma and serum. Calcium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment
of parathyroid disease, a variety of bone diseases, chronic renal disease and tetany
(intermittent muscular contractions or spasms).
The GemLyte Lithium Assay is intended to measure lithium (from the drug lithium
carbonate) in whole blood, plasma and serum. Measurements of lithium are used to
assure that the proper drug dosage is administered in the treatment of patients with mental
disturbances, such as manic-depressive illness (bipolar disorder).

I. Device Description:
The GemLyte is an automated, microprocessor-controlled analyzer which utilizes ion-
selective electrodes for the measurement of sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium and lithium
in serum, plasma, whole blood and prediluted urine samples. GemLyte analyzer is fully
automated with simple ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ commands for menu navigation. The analyzer self-
calibrates using Diamond Diagnostics Fluid Pack (k013850) every 4 hours through out the
day or on request. Diamond Diagnostics controls (k033063) are the recommended quality
control material to be used daily.

L. Test Principle:
The GemLyte measures sodium, potassium and chloride in whole blood, serum, plasma, and
urine and ionized calcium and lithium in whole blood, serum, and plasma, using ion selective
electrode technology. The flow-through sodium electrode contains a glass tube, specially
formulated to be sensitive to sodium ions. The flow-through potassium, chloride, ionized
calcium, and lithium electrodes incorporate a neutral carrier ionophore membrane. The
potential of each electrode is measured relative to a fixed, stable voltage established by the
silver/silver chloride reference electrode. An ion selective electrode develops a voltage that
varies with the concentration of the ion to which it responds. The relationship between the
voltage developed and the concentration of the sensed ion is logarithmic.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run precision was calculated with results from three whole blood, serum,
plasma, and urine samples for each analyte. The sample concentrations were across
the measuring range. The protocol called for running 30 replicates of each sample
without calibration between measurements. The replicates were run consecutively in
one day. The results are summarized below.

Total precision was calculated with results from three whole blood, serum, plasma,
and urine samples for each analyte. The samples concentrations were across the
measuring range. The samples were measured twice a day in duplicate for ten
consecutive days resulting in n=40 replicates. A second study for sodium and
chloride was conducted in a similar manner to determine precision at higher levels
and resulted in 20 and 14 replicates respectively. One whole blood sample and three
urine samples had n=39 replicates due to instrument errors. The results are
summarized below.

Reportable ranges were determined based on the linearity studies (see b. above).
e. Analytical specificity:
Plasma samples were prepared with high and low concentrations of sodium (130 and
150 mmol/L), potassium (3 and 5 mmol/L), chloride (85 and 115 mmol/L), ionized
calcium (1 and 2 mmol/L), and lithium (0.2 and 1.5 mmol/L). Interferants were
added to these samples and tested: salicyclic acid (4.4 mM), bicarbonate (40 mM),
albumin (60 g/L), triglycerides (30 mM), lithium (3.2 mM), bromide (32 mM),
thiocyante (7 mM), sodium (30 mM), magnesium (15 mM), and calcium (2 mM). The
results were compared to sodium, potassium, and chloride samples without
interferent.
No interference was defined by the sponsor as a difference of <2 mmol/L for sodium,
<0.25 mmol/L for potassium, <2.8 mmol/L for chloride, < 0.17 mmol/L for ionized
calcium, and <0.3 mmol/L for lithium. Albumin at 60 g/L, bromide at 32 mM, and
thiocyanate at 7 mM showed interference with the chloride test. None of the
substances caused interference in the sodium, potassium, ionized calcium and lithium
assays.
The sponsor lists in the labeling that hemolyzed or iteric samples should not be used
as these potential interferants have not been evaluated.
f. Assay cut-off:
No Applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparisons to the predicate device were performed with whole blood,
plasma, serum and urine patient samples. Some samples were spiked or diluted to
fully span the claimed measuring ranges. The results are summarized below.
