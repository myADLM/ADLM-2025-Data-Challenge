M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the Diazyme Lp(a) Enzymatic Assay was evaluated
according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute EP5-A guideline. In
the study, three levels of serum specimens containing about 17.2, 43.2, and
70.0 mg/dL Lp(a) respectively are tested with 2 runs per day with duplicates
over 20 working days on Hitachi 717.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Eleven levels of linearity set were prepared by diluting a serum control
containing 100 mg/dL LP(a) with saline according to Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute EP6-A to test a range from 5 to 100 mg/dL LP(a) and was
shown to be linear. The following regression equation was obtained.
y = 0.9945x + 0.5997
R2 = 0.9985
The assay has a linear range up to 100 mg/dL and a low reportable range to
5.44 mg/dL based on LOQ.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators
Using a single lot of predicate device reagents and calibrator, Diazyme Lp(a)
master lot of calibrator materials were assigned values as follows. The
calibrator materials were assayed as samples three times in triplicate on the
Hitachi 717 Analyzer. For each calibrator level, mean values were calculated
from the data points and assigned as the calibrator value. For each new lot of
calibrator materials produced, the master lot or reference lot calibrator is used
in conjunction with the reference lot of Diazyme reagents to test and verify
calibrator value.
Controls
Using in-house reagents and calibrator, control materials were assigned values
as follows. The control materials were assayed as samples three times in
triplicate on the Hitachi 7171 analyzer with a single lot of released reagents
and calibrator. Fer each control level, mean values were calculated from the
data points and assigned as the target value.
Stability for both calibrators and controls is based on real time stability
studies.
d. Detection limit:
The LOB, LOD, and LOQ of Diazyme LP(a) Assay was determined
according to CLSI EP17-A: Protocols for Determination of Limits of

Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline on the Hitachi 717.
LOB was determined using a BSA solution in phosphate buffered saline and
tested twenty times each day for three days. The LOD was determined using
low samples tested in replicates of four each day for three days. LOQ was
determined using 6 samples ranging from 0.42 to 17.38 mg/dL and using a
fitted curve to determine the value at 20% CV. The results obtained are as
follows:
• The Limit of Blank (LOB) for Lp(a) assay is 0.64 mg/dL
• The Limit of detection (LOD) for Lp(a) assay is 1.14 mg/dL
• The Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) for Lp(a) assay is 5.44 mg/dL
e. Analytical specificity:
Two levels of Lp(a) 16 and 43 mg/dL were tested for interference from
hemoglobin to 1000 mg/dL, Bilirubin to 40 mg/dL, conjugated Bilirubin to 40
mg/dL, triglyceride to 1000 mg/dL and Ascorbic Acid to10 mM with no
interference based on ± 10% deviation from expected result.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To demonstrate method comparison, the Diazyme LP(a) Assay was tested
with individual serum samples and with the Denka Lp(a)-Latex Seiken Assay
and calibrator (k013359).
A total of 76 serum samples were used for the comparison experiment. To
ensure the concentrations of LP(a) distributed across the reportable dynamic
range, some serum samples were spiked with stock solution of LP(a) or
diluted with saline to targeted concentrations.
LP(a) concentrations obtained with Diazyme LP(a) Enzymatic Assay are
plotted against that obtained with Denka Seiken Lp(a) Reagent kit (Predicate)
on HITACHI 717.
