H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The C. DIFF QUIK CHEK COMPLETE™ test is a rapid membrane enzyme
immunoassay for the simultaneous detection of C. difficile glutamate dehydrogenase
antigen and toxins A and B in a single reaction well. The test detects C. difficile antigen,
glutamate dehydrogenase, as a screen for the presence of C. difficile and confirms the
presence of toxigenic C. difficile by detecting toxins A and B in fecal specimens from
persons suspected of having C. difficile disease. The test is to be used as an aid in the
diagnosis of C. difficile disease. As with other C. difficile tests, results should be
considered in conjunction with the patient history.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
This 510(k) Premarket Notification was prepared and referenced the following guidance
document and recognized standard:
• “Review Criteria for Devices assisting in the diagnosis of C. difficile
associated disease” May 1990, ODE/CDRH Guidance Document.
• User Protocol for Evaluation of Qualitative Test Performance, Clinical
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Approved Guideline, EP12-A (August
2002)
L. Test Principle:
The device contains a Reaction Window with two vertical lines of immobilized
antibodies and center dots of immobilized antibody. One line consists of antibodies
against C. difficile glutamate dehydrogenase and the second line contains antibodies
against C. difficile toxins A and B. After the incubation period, “Ag” reaction is
examined visually for the appearance of a vertical blue line on the “Ag” side of the
Reaction Window. A blue line indicates a positive test. If the “Ag” is positive, then the
“Tox” reaction should be examined visually for the appearance of a blue line on the
“Tox” side of the Reaction Window. A blue line indicates a positive test. A positive “C”
reaction, indicated by a vertical dotted blue line under the “C” portion of the Reaction
Window, confirms that the test is working properly and the results are valid.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the C. DIFF QUIK CHEK COMPLETE ™ test was determined
using 12 fecal specimens that were coded to prevent their identification during
testing. Testing was performed at 3 independent laboratories, which tested the
samples for 3 days. The samples produced the expected results 100% of the time.
An additional 5-day study was performed at 3 sites by running a set of low
positive, moderate positive and high negative fecal samples that were spiked with
glutamate dehydrogenase, Toxin A and Toxin B. The samples were run in triplicate,
twice a day over a 5-day period by multiple technicians at each site. The combined
antigen and toxin data from the 5-day reproducibility study is shown in Table 7. The
antigen data for Sample 1 was below 90% negative at one site and was consistently
negative for antigen at the other two sites. The toxin data for Sample A was below
90% positive at one site, and was consistently positive for toxin at the other two sites.
No single site reported results below expectations for both antigen and toxin.

The Reproducibility study was satisfactory for this type of assay.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Not applicable.
d. Detection limit:
The cutoff for GDH was determined using highly purified recombinant C. difficile
glutamate dehydrogenase (rGDH). The cutoff was determined by testing dilutions of
purified rGDH in diluent, in replicates of 20. The Limit of Detection (LOD) was
established at 0.20 ng/mL. The LOD for Toxin A and B GDH was determined using
highly purified C. difficile Toxin A and B. The LOD for each toxin was determined
by testing dilutions of purified Toxin A and B in diluent, in replicates of 20. The LOD
was established at 0.45 ng/mL for Toxin A and 0.06 ng/mL for Toxin B.

The methodologies above supports the product claims for the cutoff for Toxin A at
0.63 ng/mL, 0.16 ng/mL for Toxin B and 0.8 ng/mL for GDH.
The Limit of Detection and Cutoff studies were satisfactory for this type of assay.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Clinical studies were conducted at three external sites in Pennsylvania, Ohio and
Virginia using the C. DIFF QUIK CHEK COMPLETE ™. Clinical truth was
determined at Techlab, Inc. by testing samples using the tissue culture assay for
analysis of the toxins A and B portion of the test and bacterial culture for analysis of
the GDH antigen portion of the test. A total of 1126 fecal samples were collected and
tested in the study. The study subjects ranged in age from 5 months–100 years, and
60.1% were female.
The antigen portion of the C. DIFF QUIK CHEK COMPLETE ™ test was compared
to bacterial culture. Specimens included in the evaluation were submitted to the
clinical laboratories for routine testing. The bacterial culture test was performed
according to in-house procedures. The results are shown in Table 1.

The cutoff for the assay was established at concentrations of 0.63 ng/mL for toxin A, 0.16
ng/mL for toxin B, and 0.8 ng/mL for glutamate dehydrogenase.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The reported incidence of C. difficile disease in patients with antibiotic-associated
diarrhea may range from 5 to 20%, and hospitals may experience rates lower or higher
than this range. It is important to consider any test results in conjunction with clinical
symptoms because some healthy adults and large numbers of healthy infants (up to 50%)
will be positive for C. difficile toxin. In addition, C. difficile carriage rates of 22% to
32% have been reported in cystic fibrosis patients (1,3). In the studies conducted for this
device, using symptomatic patients, the incidence of toxins A and B was 12% and GDH
was 18%. A positive result in the antigen portion of the C. DIFF QUIK CHEK
COMPLETE ™ test confirms the presence of C. difficile in a fecal specimen; a negative
result indicates the absence of the organism. A positive result in the toxin portion of the
C. DIFF QUIK CHEK COMPLETE ™ confirms the presence of C. difficile toxin in a
fecal specimen; a negative result indicates the absence of toxin or insufficient levels of
toxin for detection.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The information submitted in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalent decision.
