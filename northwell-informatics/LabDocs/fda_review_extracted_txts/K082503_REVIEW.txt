Quantitation
Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff - Assayed and Unassayed Quality Control
Material
L. Test Principle:
Proteins contained in human body fluids form immune complexes in an immuno-
chemical reaction with specific antibodies. These complexes scatter a beam of light
passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the
concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by
comparison with a standard of known concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing for the KAPPA and LAMBDA methods were performed
using two human serum, two plasma pools, and three levels of Dimension
Vista ® Protein 1 Controls, over twenty days according to CLSI/NCCLS EP5-
A2, at a single site, using a single instrument, single reagent lot and two
operators. On each day of testing, each sample was run in duplicate, in two
separate runs. Serum and plasma pools for both methods were established at
levels that encompassed approximately 15% - 85% of the analytical
measuring range for each method. The serum and plasma pools with high
concentrations were prepared by spiking a native pool with purified antigen.
Precision for serum: Kappa
Precision for serum: Lambda

Additional performance data for the PROT1 Controls and calibrator are
available in the decision summaries for k081249 and k081161.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Kappa: The reportable range for the Kappa method [28 - 910 mg/dL (0.28 -
9.10 g/L)] was determined, according to the CLSI EP-6-A, by serially diluting
a human serum sample with an original value of 975 mg/dL (9.75 g/L) with
System Diluent. Five replicates were run at each level. The observed value
represents the mean of six replicates. The bias was determined at each level.
Lambda: The reportable range for the Lambda method [19 - 415 mg/dL (0.19
- 4.15 g/L)] was determined by serially diluting a human serum sample with a
value of 446 mg/dL (4.46 g/L) with System Diluent according to the CLSI
EP-6-A. Five replicates were run at each level. The observed values
represented the mean of six replicates. The bias was determined at each level.

Lambda 18.7 - 447 0.992 - 2.3 0.997 - 3.6 to +7.5% 13
(3.7%)
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrator and control are traceable to protein reference preparation
ERM®-DA470 (CRM 470). The values are assigned based on the process
presented by Lievens et al. Medical and Technical Usefulness of
Measurement of Kappa and lambda Immunoglobulin Light Chains in Serum
with an M-component” J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. Vol. 27, 1989 pp 519 –
523. The equation to determine the concentrations was developed from the
percentage of each IgG subclass vs. the Ig class concentration, the ratio of
relative molecular masses of the two Ig light chains vs. the total and the kappa
and lambda concentration ratio within each subclass. A master calibrator is
value assigned for IgG, IgA, and IgM vs. the ERM®-DA470. Commercial lot
values are assigned vs. the master lot and the values are calculated according
to the following equations: [kappa] = [IgG] *0.1983 + [IgA]*0.171 +
[IgM]*0.0975 and [lambda] = [IgG] *0.1054 + [IgA]*0.1206 + [IgM]*0.0305.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was established using a testing protocol outlined
in CLSI EP17-A Section 5.1 and a total analytical error of 30% based on
precision and recovery performance of the method. Three test samples were
tested at each concentration; three replicates per sample were tested per run,
for each of five runs. Testing was performed in one day with a single reagent
lot, calibrator lot, instrument and operator. The LoQ for Kappa was
determined to be 7.0 mg/dL ( 0.07 g/L) and Lambda was determined to be 4.8

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference Studies:
Test samples were prepared by spiking the potential interferent into serum.
Kappa concentrations ranged from 169 to 780 mg/dL (1.69 g/L to 7.80 g/L)
and Lambda concentrations ranged from 168 to 368 mg/dL (1.68 to 3.68 g/L).
Interference testing was performed according to CLSI/NCCLS EP7-A2 to
determine the effect of various endogenous and exogenous substances on
the Dimension Vista® KAPPA and LAMBDA assays. For all interferents
except RF the percent bias was determined by testing a control sample
without the interferent and comparing it to the value obtained from a
test sample to which the potential interferent had been added. A percent bias
exceeding 10% was considered to be interfering.

To evaluate interference from rheumatoid factors interference, samples
which had elevated RF concentrations and samples with no detectable RF
concentration were used to prepare samples for the study. For Kappa elevated
RF values were in the range 726 - 871.5 IU/mL; for Lambda the RF values
were in the range 726 -521.5 IU/mL. 1+1 mixture of samples with high
concentrations of RF were prepared and the KAPPA and LAMBDA assays
concentrations determined in replicates of five on the Dimension® Vista
System. The resulting percent bias was less than 10% indicating no
interference was observed. The following substances were determined to not
interfere with the kappa and lambda assays.

Method comparison testing was run on each de-identified patient serum
samples containing measurable amounts of Ig/L-chain kappa and lambda were
used in this study according to CLSI EP9-A2 using single determinations. ,
The only sample criteria were that there was sufficient sample volume for
testing and that mentioned above. Aliquots were stored at -20°C until tested
on the device and the predicate device.
Kappa: There were 66 serum samples tested for the initial method
comparison testing. In addition, there were 27 serum samples run for the
extended range high and 24 serum samples for the extended range low study.
Lambda: There were 66 serum samples tested for the initial method
comparison testing. In addition, there were 26 serum samples run for the
extended range high and 23 serum samples run for the extended range low.
The distribution among the sample population in the initial assay range
method comparison is as follows:

b. Matrix comparison:
In addition to the method comparison studies done using serum on the
Dimension Vista® System and the BN Prospec® System, a separate study
was done using matched serum and plasma samples on the Dimension Vista®
System. In this study, matched samples of serum, lithium heparin, sodium
heparin and EDTA were tested on the Dimension Vista® System. The %
recovery of immunoglobulin light chains kappa type, and the % recovery of
immunoglobulin light chains lambda type for each plasma type was
determined versus serum and a regression analysis was done for each plasma
type versus serum. The acceptance criteria were for a correlation coefficient of
> 0.950 and for a median of the normalized differences < 7%.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The concentration of Ig/L-chain kappa and lambda in healthy individuals is below
the detection limit for this method (less than 7.0 mg/dL ( 0.07 g/L) and Lambda
was determined to be 4.8 mg/dL (0.048 g/L) and is based on the following
literature reference: Dati F., Lammers, M., Adam, A, Sondag, D., and Stienen, L.
Referenzwerte fur 18 Plasmaproteine am Berhring- Nephlometer-System. The
range was adjusted for standardization to the international reference preparation
ERM-DA470 and confirmed by performaning a reference interval transference
study following the NCCLS/CLSI Guideline C28-A2.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
