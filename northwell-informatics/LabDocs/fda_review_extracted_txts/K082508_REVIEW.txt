L. Test Principle:
® ®
The Fastect II BUP Drug Screen Dipstick and QuickTox Drug Screen Dipcard are
based on the principle of specific immunochemical reactions between antigens and
antibodies. Both devices utilize a competitive immunoassay procedure in which an
immobilized drug conjugate competes with the drug present in urine for limited
antibody binding sites. Each test device contains a membrane strip, onto which the
drug conjugate is pre-coated at a specific region known as the test region (T). Colored
antibody-colloidal gold conjugate is coated onto a pad and is placed at one end of the

membrane. In the test procedure, when the urine is introduced to the device, the urine
migrates across the membrane by capillary action. If any drug is present in the urine,
it competes with the immobilized drug conjugate for the limited binding sites on the
colored antibody colloidal gold conjugate. When a sufficient amount of drug is
present, the drug will saturate the antibodies, and the colored colloidal gold conjugate
cannot bind to the drug conjugate immobilized on the membrane. Thus, the absence
of a color band at the test region (T) indicates a positive result for the test. If there is
no drug or drug metabolite present to compete for the binding sites of the colored
colloidal gold conjugate, it binds to the immobilized drug conjugate to form a visible
band at the test region (T) of the membrane. The presence of a color band at the test
region (T) indicates a negative result for the test. A control band with a different
antigen/antibody reaction is added to the immunochromatographic membrane strip at
the control region. This control band should always appear regardless of the presence
of drug or metabolite.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Assay precision was assessed with three lots (lots A and B were the Fastect II
device and lot C was the QuickTox device) tested by three individuals over
three consecutive days. Buprenorphine standard was added to drug-free
human urine specimens to produce the concentrations shown below. Each
sample was divided into 75 aliquots that were further divided into 3 sets of 25
(one set for each lot).

Reading time:
The sponsor conducted a reading time study to validate the optimal reading
time for the Fastect II BUP Drug Screen Dipstick and QuickTox Drug Screen
Dipcard. Pooled drug-free human urine specimens were spiked with
commercially available buprenorphine to achieve five LC/MS/MS confirmed
concentration levels (+/-50%, +/-25% and the cutoff). Twenty spiked urine
samples were prepared for each concentration level, along with twenty
samples prepared from negative pooled urine. The samples were tested at 3, 4,
5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes and 90 minutes. The results
support the sponsors reading time between 3 to 5 minutes but not more than
15 minutes for both formats.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device has internal process controls. Each strip in the device contains a
procedural control that appears in the control line region indicating that the
proper volume of urine has been added. The sponsor informs the user not to
interpret the test if a colored line failed to appear in the control region.

d. Detection limit:
Sensitivity of qualitative assays may be characterized by validating
performance around the claimed cutoff concentration of the assay, and
demonstrating the lowest concentration of drug that is capable of or
consistently producing a positive result. Pooled urine was spiked with
commercially available buprenorphine to obtain 5 concentrations (-50%, -
25%, +25%, +50% and the cutoff). The samples were confirmed by
LC/MS/MS and the levels detected with +/-15% of the target concentrations
shown below.

Dipcard devices were evaluated for specificity and cross-reactivity. Related
compounds were spiked to a high target concentration of 100,000 ng/mL and
tested. The spiked samples were serially diluted and tested to determine the
lowest concentration that produced a positive result with the devices. The
specificity results are shown in the table below.

Normal drug-free urine was spiked with many compounds commonly found in
urine and with other analytes that the device is capable of detecting to a target
concentration of 100,000 ng/mL. Compounds that tested positive at 100,000
ng/mL were serially diluted and tested to determine the lowest concentration
that produced a positive result with the devices. There were no interferences
detected for the buprenorphine except for structurally similar compounds
listed above. These interferences are noted in the insert.
Urine pH was evaluated for interference with the device. Drug-free urine was
spiked with commercially available buprenorphine to prepare concentrations
at 7.5 ng/mL (near negative -25%), and12.5 ng/mL (near positive +25%). The
sample was adjusted with NaOH or HCl to produce the following pH levels:
4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5 and 8.5. The results were all negative at 7.5 ng/mL and all
positive for concentrations of 12.5 ng/mL. These results showed that the
range of the pH tested did not interfere with either format of the test.
.
The effect of urine specific gravity was evaluated for interference with the
device. Pooled negative urine (pH confirmed with a refractometer of 1.010)
was diluted and/spiked with sodium chloride to obtain specific gravity that
ranged from 1.005 to 1.030. The samples were spiked with commercially
available buprenorphine to prepare concentrations at 7.5 ng/mL (near negative
-25%), and12.5 ng/mL (near positive +25%).. The results were all negative at
7.5 ng/mL and all positive at concentrations of 12.5 ng/mL. These results
showed that the range of specific gravity tested did not interfere with either
format of the test.
To evaluate the interference with buprenorphine from other drugs
(benzoylecgonine, morphine, methamphetamine, THC, amphetamine,
MDMA, PCP, oxazapam, secobarbital, methadone, oxycodone and
buprenorphine) the sponsor conducted an interference study. Buprenorphine
was spiked into urine controls to achieve five concentration levels: -25%,
+25%, -50%, +50% and cut-off level. There were no interferences observed.
