E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Applied Biosystems (AB) 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument
integrates a thermal cycler, a fluorimeter and application specific software. The
instrument houses the thermal cycler and the fluorimeter, while the application
software is run on a PC that is attached to the instrument. Samples are placed in a
tube strip or 96-well low-head space plate that is moved to a Peltier-based thermal
block and positioned relative to the optics using a tray loading mechanism.
Excitation for all samples is provided by a halogen tungsten white source that
passes through 5 switchable excitation filters prior to reaching the sample.
Fluorescence emission is then detected through a 5 color emissions filter wheel to
a charge coupled device (CCD) camera. The instrument is designed to complete
quantitative RT-PCR runs in about 40 minutes.
The Sequence Detection Software (SDS) version 1.4 for the 7500 Fast Dx
Instrument is used for instrument control, data collection and data analysis. The
software can measure cycle-by-cycle real-time signals from the sample. The
software provides a variety of tools to help the user analyze the data extracted
from the samples. The software also provides lamp-life monitoring and other
instrument maintenance information. The software runs as an application on
Windows® XP platform. Changes to the Dx software are subject to change
control in accordance with 21 CFR Part 820.40.

software provides a variety of tools to help the user analyze the data extracted
from the samples. The software also provides lamp-life monitoring and other
instrument maintenance information.
Operational Environment
The SDS 1.4 software functions on the Microsoft® Windows® XP Pro SP2
operating system.
3. Modes of Operation:
Batch via 96 well plate or tube strip
4. Specimen Identification:
Entered by user.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimens are processed according to assay instructions.
6. Calibration:
Calibration is performed at regular six-month intervals by AB service personnel.
The user performs a background calibration. A background calibration measures
the level of background fluorescence in the instrument. During a background
calibration run, the instrument:
• Performs continuous reads of a background plate containing PCR buffer
for 10 minutes at 60 °C.
• Averages the spectra recorded during the run and extracts the resulting
spectral component to a calibration file.
The software then uses the calibration file during subsequent runs to remove the
background fluorescence from the run data. The user is directed to perform this
calibration monthly or as often as necessary depending on instrument use, well as
after replacing the lamp.
7. Quality Control:
Quality control is addressed for each separately cleared specific assay to be run on

a. Accuracy:
Accuracy was assessed during the clearance of the assay (k080570) and will
be addressed for each assay to be run on this system.
b. Precision/Reproducibility:
The rRT-PCR Flu Panel reproducibility and precision studies were performed
to evaluate reproducibility of the assay at three separate laboratory sites using
the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-time PCR instruments and SDS software version
1.4.
The ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument functionality was validated
at each site by AB prior to the reproducibility assessment using a panel of nine
(9) simulated samples included influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, A/H5N1
(reassortant), and Influenza B at two viral RNA concentrations each (a low
viral RNA concentration and a 1:10 dilution of the same sample). The low
viral RNA concentration generally was one log above the assay cut-off for all
analytes, whereas the 1:10 dilution of the same sample approximated a sample
at the assay cut-off. Simulated samples in the panel used in the
reproducibility evaluation were:
• Sample #1 Influenza A/H1N1 at a low viral RNA titer range
• Sample #2 Influenza A/H1N1 at a 1:10 dilution of sample #1
• Sample #3 Influenza A/H3N2 at a low viral RNA titer range
• Sample #4 Influenza A/H3N2 at a 1:10 dilution of sample #3
• Sample #5 Influenza A/H5N1 WT at a low viral RNA titer range
• Sample #6 Influenza A/H5N1 WT at a 1:10 dilution of sample #5
• Sample #7 Influenza B Yamagata at a low viral RNA titer range
• Sample #8 Influenza B Yamagata at a 1:10 dilution of sample #7
• Sample #9 Influenza Negative (Uninfected A549 cells)
The panels and assay controls were tested at each site by 2 operators on 5
different days within a 10-day period. Each participating clinical site tested
one of the four RNA purification methods recommended for use with the
assay (k080570) to evaluate reproducibility of the CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panel
on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instruments. The manufacturer’s
instructions for use provided in the package insert were followed. Results
generated for each of the extraction methods are summarized in the tables
below.

Well-to-Well Temperature Uniformity
The sponsor performed a Temperature Non-Uniformity (TNU) Test to verify
that temperature set points are maintained in a uniform manner across the
entire sample block. The test was carried out at two different temperature set
points relevant to the use of the instrument, 94°C and 60°C, and the test was
deemed passing if the average of the difference of the highest and lowest
temperature readings across the eight wells that were tested for each set point
was less than 1°C. The results are in the table below:

The sponsor also performed a Temperature Accuracy test to verify that the
instrument can ramp to and hold a programmed temperature accurately. The
test was carried out at two different temperature set points relevant to the use
of the instrument, 85°C and 45°C, and the test was deemed passing if the
average temperature across the eight wells that were tested for each set point
was within ±0.5°C of that set point. The results are in the table below:

The data demonstrate the ability of the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR
instrument to maintain uniform and accurate temperatures across the sample
block.
Well-to-Well Signal Uniformity
The sponsor performed an RNase P verification that addresses well-to-well
signal uniformity by measuring the average signal and standard deviation of
two unknown sample populations. The study was designed to demonstrate
both well-to-well signal uniformity as well as that the instrument is capable of
discriminating between two populations of samples with a two-fold difference
in copy number.
The RNase P plate was pre-loaded with the reagents necessary for the
detection and quantitation of genomic copies of the human RNase P gene (a
single-copy gene encoding the RNase moiety of the RNase P enzyme).
Each well contained:
• TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix
• RNase P primers
• FAM™ dye-labeled probe
• Known concentration of human genomic DNA template
The figure below illustrates the arrangement of the standard and unknown
populations on the RNase P plate. The RNase P plate contained five replicate
groups of standards (1250, 2500, 5000, 10,000, and 20,000 copies), two
unknown populations (5000 and 10,000 copies), and four no template control
(NTC) wells.

After the run, the SDS software:
• Generated a standard curve from the averaged threshold cycle (CT)
values of the replicate groups of standards.
• Calculated the concentration of the two unknown populations using the
standard curve.
• Calculated the following using the mean quantity and standard
deviation for the unknown populations to assess the instrument
performance:
[(CopyUnk ) - 3(σ )] > [(CopyUnk ) + 3(σ )]
2 CopyUnk2 1 CopyUnk1
where:
CopyUnk1 = Average copy number of unknown #1 (5,000-copy
population)
σ = Standard deviation of unknown #1 (5,000-copy
CopyUnk1
population)
CopyUnk = Average copy number of unknown #2 (10,000-copy
2
population)
σ = Standard deviation of unknown #2 (10,000-copy
CopyUnk2
population)
The instrument passes the verification if the analyzed data demonstrates that
the instrument distinguishes between 5,000 and 10,000 genome equivalents
(i.e. a two-fold difference in copy number) with a 99.7% confidence level.
The results are presented in the table below and show the ABI 7500 Fast Dx
Real-Time PCR instrument met the passing criteria outlined above. These
results also show the uniformity of the readout of the same signal (i.e. 10k
copy or 5 k copy) between different wells (note standard deviations and % CV
of < 6), and the performance of the standard curve (R2 values > 0.99).
