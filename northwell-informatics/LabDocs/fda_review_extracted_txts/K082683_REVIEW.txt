b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity was evaluated with three glucose meters using blood samples at seven

samples containing heparin anticoagulant at approximately 40% hematocrit. The
range of glucose concentrations used was 5 to 720 mg/dL and the sponsor performed
these studies using a version of the meter with the Hi and Lo glucose concentration
flags disabled.
The results of meter readings vs. YSI Plasma Values were compared using linear
regression analysis and are summarized in the table below:

Results equal to or below 20 mg/dL are reported as “Lo” and results greater than or
equal to 600 mg/dL reported as “Hi.” The measuring range is from 20 to 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The test system was compared to the YSI. See the method comparison section 2
below.
Stability characteristics of the test strips were determined using real-time unopened
and open-vial studies. When stored at the recommended storage temperature of 36° F
to 90°F the unopened shelf-life is 18 months and once opened, the test strips are
stable for up to 3 months.
Stability characteristics of the control solutions were determined using real-time
unopened and open-vial studies. The unopened shelf-life is 24 months at the
recommended storage of 46° F to 86°F. Once opened, the control solutions are stable
for 3 months when stored at 46° F to 86°F.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity 1.b. above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Hematocrit:
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated with one test strip lot and five
glucose meters and using blood samples at five glucose concentrations (50, 160, 275,
390 and 500 mg/dL). The glucose samples were prepared from venous blood
containing heparin anticoagulant at five different hematocrit levels ranging from 15-
65%. Glucose results for each concentration and hematocrit level were compared to
the same samples tested on the YSI reference method. Additionally, the samples at
15, 20, 60, and 65% hematocrit were compared to samples with 40% hematocrit using
the same SD Check Gold meter.
Samples with 20% and 60% hematocrit tested on the SD Check Gold meter were
within +/15% of the same sample tested on YSI and the 40% hematocrit sample. The
sponsor claims an acceptable hematocrit range of 20 to 60%.

Endogenous compounds and drugs:
The sponsor evaluated the interference from different concentrations of the
substances listed below. Three glucose levels were tested for each interferant, 70
mg/dL, 100 mg/dL and 300 mg/dL. The sponsor defined interference as when the test
sample containing interferant does not recover within +/-10% of the control sample
without interferant.
Studies demonstrated that all the interfering substances listed below did not
significantly interfere with the glucose readings.

Altitude:
An altitude effect study was performed by testing each of six different venous
samples with glucose values from 20-621 mg/dL (Hi and Lo settings disabled) at sea
level and at elevated altitudes up to 11,351 feet.
At each altitude tested, results using the SD Check Gold meter were compared to
results using the YSI glucose analyzer. At altitudes up to 11,351 feet, results with the
SD Check Gold meter were within +/-7.5 mg/dL for results <75 mg/dL and within +/-
15% for results >75 mg/dL.
Temperature and humidity studies were performed and showed that the meter can be
used at temperatures from 10-40°C and at a relative humidity from 15-90%

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The system accuracy evaluation for the SD Check Gold Blood Glucose Monitoring
System has been performed according to EN ISO 15197:2003.
Trained professionals obtained 90 natural samples from the fingertip of study
participants. Ten samples were contrived in order to obtain samples <50 mg/dL and
>400 mg/dL. Samples ranged in value from 20-600 mg/dL.
Testing was performed with 2 different meters and 1 lot of test strips over a two
month period. For comparison, each sample was also tested using the YSI glucose
analyzer. The results are summarized below:
For glucose concentrations ≤ 75 mg/dL
within ± 5 mg/dL within ± 10 mg/dL within ± 15 mg/dL
73% (19/26) 92% (24/26) 100% (26/26)

b. Clinical specificity:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
A user study was performed to demonstrate that lay consumers could obtain accurate
results using the SD Check Gold blood glucose monitoring system. The study was
performed using capillary whole blood from fingertip, palm, forearm, and upper arm
sample sites. A total of 171 individuals were recruited for the study. All were in
“steady state.” Fingertip sample results ranged in concentration from 72-488 mg/dL.
Using only the labeling intended to be provided with the marketed device and without
assistance or coaching, each participant performed their own fingerstick testing on the
SD Check Gold BGMS. They were then instructed to perform testing using samples
obtained from alternative sites: palm, forearm, and upper arm. Laboratory
professionals collected additional capillary blood from each participant for testing on
both the SD Check Gold BGMS and the YSI glucose laboratory method.
Of the 171 participants, three individuals were not able to obtain a sample from the
upper arm alternative site. One individual was not able to obtain a sample from
forearm and upper arm.
The results of the user and alternative site studies are summarized below:

O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for each additional
reading.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes __X______ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm,
forearm, or upper arm only. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test
strip there are no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
A calibration code chip is provided with each vial of test strips.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor is providing a one level of glucose control solution (Level M) with the
starter kit for the device. A two level control set (Level M and Level H) is available for
purchase, as stated in the labeling. When a test strip is inserted into the meter, a control
can be run. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial
label. The user is referred to the user manual and customer support for problems.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
The sponsor performed a readability assessment of the labeling and states that the user
manual, strip insert, and control insert are written at 8th grade level or below.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
