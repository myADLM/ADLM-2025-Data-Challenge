H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Pro hMPV+ Assay is a Real Time RT-PCR in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative
detection of human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) nucleic acid isolated and purified from
nasopharyngeal swab (NP) specimens obtained from individuals exhibiting signs and
symptoms of acute respiratory infection. This assay targets a highly conserved region of the
Nucleocapsid gene of hMPV. The detection of hMPV nucleic acid from symptomatic
patients aids in the diagnosis of human respiratory hMPV infection if used in conjunction
with other clinical and laboratory findings. This test is not intended to differentiate the four
genetic sub-lineages of hMPV.
Negative results do not preclude hMPV infection and should not be used as the sole basis for
diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Indication(s) for use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
To be used with the Cepheid SmartCycler II Real Time Instrument with Dx Software
version 1.7b or 3.0a and either a MagNA Pure LC Instrument (Roche) and the MagNA
Pure Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche) or a NucliSENS® easyMAG™ System
(bioMérieux) and the Automated Magnetic Extraction Reagents (bioMérieux).
I. Device Description:
The Pro hMPV+ Assay is a Taqman based Real Time RT-PCR Assay that enables
detection of human Metapneumovirus and Internal Control.
An overview of the procedure is as follows:
2

--- Page 3 ---
1. Collect nasopharyngeal swab specimens from symptomatic patients using a
polyester, rayon or nylon tipped swab and place into viral transport medium (not
provided with kit).
2. Add an Internal Control (IC) to every sample to monitor for inhibitors present
in the specimens.
3. Perform extraction and purification of nucleic acids using a MagNA Pure LC
Instrument (Roche) and the MagNA Pure Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche)
or a NucliSENS® easyMAG™ System (bioMérieux) and the Automated Magnetic
Extraction Reagents (bioMérieux).
4. Add purified nucleic acids to Pro hMPV+ Supermix along with enzymes included
in the Assay kit. The Pro hMPV+ Supermix contains oligonucleotide primers and
target-specific oligonucleotide probes. The primers and probe are complementary to
highly conserved regions of the Nucleocapsid gene of hMPV. The probes are dual-
labeled with a reporter dye attached to the 5’-end and a quencher dye attached to the
3’-end (see table below).
5. Perform reverse transcription of RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) and
subsequent amplification of DNA in a Cepheid SmartCycler® II instrument. In this
process, the probe anneals specifically to the cDNA template followed by primer
extension and amplification. The 5’ – 3’ exonuclease activity of the Taq polymerase
cleaves the probe separating the reporter dye from the quencher. This generates an
increase in fluorescent signal upon excitation from a light source. With each cycle,
additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes, further
increasing fluorescent signal. The amount of fluorescence at any given cycle is
dependent on the amount of amplification products present at that time. Fluorescent
intensity is monitored during each PCR cycle by the real-time instrument.

L. Test Principle:
The real-time PCR process simultaneously amplifies and detects nucleic acid targets in a single
closed-tube reaction. The Pro hMPV+ Assay enables detection of hMPV and the Internal
Control RNA and is based on three processes: nucleic acid isolation, reverse transcription and
Real Time PCR amplification/detection. Human respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal swabs)
from symptomatic patients are processed initially to isolate and purify viral nucleic acid from
the cellular specimen matrix. Each purified nucleic acid sample is added to the Pro hMPV+
Supermix (includes Taq polymerase) along with the appropriate enzymes (reverse transcriptase
and RNase Inhibitor). The Pro hMPV+ Supermix contains oligonucleotide primers
complementary to highly conserved regions of the Nucleocapsid gene for hMPV and target-
specific oligonucleotide probes dual-labeled with a reporter dye and a quencher dye. After
initial reverse transcription of RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA), amplification proceeds
during which the probe anneals specifically to a region of the template between the forward
and reverse primers. As primer extension and amplification occurs, the exonuclease activity of
the Taq polymerase cleaves the probe separating the reporter dye away from the quencher. This
generates an increase in fluorescent signal upon excitation from an LED light source of
appropriate wavelength. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from
their respective probes, yielding increased fluorescence signal. The amount of fluorescence at
any given cycle is dependent on the amount of PCR product (amplicons) present at that time.

Fluorescent intensity is monitored at each PCR cycle by fluorescent detection modules within
the real-time instrument.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
An Inter-Laboratory Reproducibility study was conducted by extracting and testing a
panel of 9 samples at three sites performed by two operators at each site for 5 days per
operator (for a total of 10 runs per site). The Reproducibility Panel used in the study
was prepared by spiking nasopharyngeal (NP) swab pools with cultured and titered
stock solutions of human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) subtypes A2 (strain Iowa 14) and
B2 (strain Iowa 8) at low positive (2x LoD), medium positive (10x LoD) or high
negative (0.01x LoD) concentrations. Panel members were coded and randomly sorted
to make 9- sample test panels and to ensure sample identification was unknown to the
operators. The 9-sample test panels were stored at ≤–70oC and shipped to the sites
frozen.
A set of ten 9-sample test panels (15 samples for each of the 6 reproducibility panel
members x 6 reproducibility panel members = 90 total samples) was provided to each
laboratory; one test panel was used for each of the 5 testing days per operator. Each
operator thawed one 9-sample test panel per day, spiked the samples and a Negative
Control with the Internal Control, performed nucleic acid extraction on the test panel
samples using either the Roche MagNA Pure LC system (Clinical Trial Site #4) or the
bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG (Site #1 and Site #2). An Extraction Control, non-
infectious hMPV strain (A2 lineage) obtained from ZeptoMetrix Corp. (Buffalo, NY),
was also included with each extraction run. Extracted nucleic acid was tested with the
Pro hMPV+ Assay on the Cepheid SmartCycler II. The Positive hMPV RNA Control
was also included with each test panel run. Each of two operators performed these
activities on five days for a total of 10 reproducibility runs per site. A single lot of Pro
hMPV+ reagents was used. A total of 360 data points were included in the
reproducibility study data analysis (12 samples and controls/run X 1 run/day/operator X
2 operators X 5 days X 3 sites = 360). The total percent agreement for the Pro hMPV+
Assay was 99.2%. The Pro hMPV+ Assay is a qualitative assay based partially on
numerical Cycle Threshold (Ct) values. The overall Ct value %CV across all sites for
all samples and controls ranged from 1.72% to 7.36% depending upon analyte type,
target type, and concentration tested.

Positive Control (PC): The Pro hMPV+ Assay kit contains an hMPV positive RNA
control that is an RNA transcript of a plasmid containing the viral sequence of interest
and is not intact virus particles. The PC does not go through nucleic acid extraction and
purification, but is included during set-up of the RT-PCR reaction. The PC in
conjunction with the IC is used to verify reagent and system performance. The PC is
meant to be a control for global failure of the assay (missing reaction component,
instrument failure, etc). As such, wide acceptance criteria were desired. The typical
range for the PC in preliminary testing was in the low-mid 30’s. Therefore, the
acceptable range was set to 25.0 to 40.0 in the Clinical Trial Protocol to allow for
dilution variability (e.g. pipetting) of the PC by the user. Of a total of 69 PC tested by
the Pro hMPV+ Assay during the clinical trial, 100% (69/69) of these controls gave
correct results. The average Ct of the PCs tested is 31.9 (Min 29.4- Max 33.6), with
0.68 Standard Deviation (STDEV) and 2.13 % CV. The pivotal clinical study data
validated the pre-determined PC Ct acceptance range of 25.0 to 40.0.
Internal Control (IC): An Internal RNA Control, a non-infectious RNA transcript, is
incorporated into every sample and is carried through all steps of the procedure from
nucleic acid isolation and purification through amplification to monitor for inhibitors
present in the specimen or reaction tube. The IC also serves as a general process control
ensuring that each step of the procedure was performed correctly, assay and instrument
parameters were set correctly, and that general reagents were working. The typical
range for the IC in preliminary testing was in the mid-20’s. To accommodate for
dilution variability (e.g. pipetting) by the user in spiking the IC, and also accommodate
slight inhibition, the range was set to 15.0 to 47.0 in the Clinical Trial Protocol. The
average Ct of all eligible Pro hMPV+ negative specimens is 26.98 (Min 23.90- Max
46.0), with 2.02 Standard Deviation (STDEV) and 7.48 % CV. The pivotal clinical
study data validated the pre-determined IC Ct acceptance range of 15.0 to 47.0. A new
IC Ct acceptable range of 17.0 to 40.0 was set based on Clinical Trial and (QC) Test
Method Characterization data.
These RNA transcripts (PC and IC) were serially diluted in molecular grade water
containing RNase Inhibitor at 1U/µL and made into the manufactured product included
in the Pro hMPV+ Assay kit. They are tested for final release by performing a
prescribed dilution and using the Pro hMPV+ Assay to ascertain the cycles at which
these dilutions cross the threshold (cutoff). The specifications for final release are
acceptable ranges of cycles at which the RNA control dilution can cross the threshold:
Kit Control Final Release Specifications

Limit (PCR cycles) Limit (PCR cycles)
hMPV 26.76 38.67
Internal Control 21.83 32.67
The following controls are not provided in the Pro hMPV+ Assay kit, but are required
or recommended and described in the Pro hMPV+ Assay Instructions for Use :

RNA Control	Lower Specification
Limit (PCR cycles)	Upper Specification
Limit (PCR cycles)

Internal Control	21.83	32.67

--- Page 10 ---
Negative Control (NC): A Negative Control (NC) is not provided with the kit, but is
required and described in the Pro hMPV+ Assay Instructions for Use. Viral transport
media spiked with the IC is to be used as the negative control and processed starting
from nucleic acid isolation. The negative control serves to monitor for contamination.
Of a total of 88 NC tested by the Pro hMPV+ Assay during the clinical trial, 100%
(88/88) of these controls gave correct results. The average Ct of the IC in tested NC is
25.7 (Min 24.2 - Max 29.5), with 1.01 Standard Deviation (STDEV) and 3.93 % CV.
Extraction Control (EC): An Extraction Control (EC) is not provided with the kit,
however, during the clinical trial, a non-infectious hMPV strain (A2 lineage) was
included with each extraction run as EC. Of a total of 87 EC tested by the Pro hMPV+
Assay during the clinical trial, 100% (87/87) of these controls gave correct results. The
average Ct of the EC is 32.7 (Min 27.9 - Max 37.3), with 2.04 Standard Deviation
(STDEV) and 6.24 % CV. The sponsor is recommending an extraction control in
each nucleic acid extraction run to the end users in the package insert.
Freeze/Thaw and Stability
Reagents and Controls stability
An Accelerated Stability study concluded that all Pro hMPV+ reagents and controls
(closed and open tubes) can be stored at ≤-70oC for up to 18 months. A Freeze/Thaw
Study of Pro hMPV+ Supermix and enzymes included with the kit demonstrated that
components can undergo up to 5 freeze-thaws and Controls (Positive and Internal
Control) can undergo up to 2freeze-thaws. For the Controls, the Pro hMPV+ Assay
Package Insert specifies that controls should not undergo more than 1 freeze-thaw
cycle. Although internal studies demonstrated that up to 2 freeze-thaws of controls
would not adversely affect performance, in an effort to mitigate risk it is recommended
they not undergo more than 1 freeze-thaw.
A real time stability plan has been approved and is in the early stages of
implementation. One master lot of reagents has been QC tested. The QC test acts as the
initial time point for RT stability testing. The second time point has not been reached.
Two additional master lots of product will be added to the real time stability study (per
the plan) as they are added to the production schedule.
Specimen stability
The Pro hMPV+ Assay recommends that samples be stored refrigerated (2oC – 8oC) for
up to 72 hours prior to processing the samples. This recommendation is supported by a)
The CLSI Guidance: Collection, Transport, Preparation and Storage of Specimens for
Molecular Methods (MM13) recommends that bronchioalveolar lavage samples be
refrigerated for up to 72 hours or frozen (at -70oC) for longer periods prior to
processing for molecular methods; b) A 72 hour timeframe is widely recommended and
used (CLSI Guidance M41 Viral Culture) for viral culture. c) The viral transport
medium that nasopharyngeal swab samples are collected in also serves to further
10

--- Page 11 ---
“preserve” and “stabilize” viruses, to maintain their viability for culture and NAAT.
Furthermore, the average time to extraction was 37 hours during the clinical trial. The
distribution of the times is tri-modal, reflecting the impact of working hours on the
times to extraction. Site 4 has the longest average time to extraction (47 hours) while
Site 1 has the shortest time (31 hours). There was no observed impact of times to
extraction on hMPV or IC Ct values.
The Pro hMPV+ Assay also recommends that extracted nucleic acid samples can be
stored at -70oC until RT-PCR testing, and they should be tested after no more than one
freeze-thaw cycle. This recommendation is supported by a) Both CLSI guidance
documents MM13 (Collection, Transport, Preparation and Storage of Specimens for
Molecular Methods) and MM17 (Verification and Validation of Multiplex Nucleic Acid
Assays) recommend storage of isolated RNA at -80oC and limiting the number of
freeze-thaw cycles before testing; b) A study that compared the extracted nucleic acid
isolated from the Extraction Control (EC) during the clinical trial being tested “fresh”
or after undergoing one freeze-thaw cycle was conducted. Sites 1 and 2 ran both
“fresh” and “frozen” EC nucleic acids and t-test analysis demonstrated that there is no
significant difference between the two conditions (p > 0.05 for each site); c) A subset of
hMPV positive samples from the clinical trial were re-run from the purified nucleic acid
at the same time the reference assays were being set up. All of the samples in the subset
were initially run as “fresh” nucleic acids and the repeat testing was indicative of 1
freeze-thaw cycle. Although a paired t-test analysis indicates that the mean Ct values of
hMPV-positive sample nucleic acids that have undergone one freeze-thaw cycle are
statistically different (p<0.05) than the mean Ct values of “fresh” hMPV-positive
sample nucleic acids, the mean Ct difference is clinically insignificant (mean = 0.22;
range = 0 – 1.5 Ct).
d. Analytical Sensitivity (Detection limit):
LoD studies using the Roche MagNA Pure LC
The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection or LoD) of the Pro hMPV+ Assay was
determined using quantified (TCID /mL) cultures of 2 hMPV strains (hMPV A2 Iowa
50
14 and hMPV B2 Iowa 8) serially diluted in negative nasopharyngeal (NP) pools
prepared from leftover NP swab clinical samples. Each viral strain was previously
cultured and titered to determine its stock concentration in TCID /mL. Each viral stock
50
was spiked into negative NP swab pools at concentrations of 1 log above, 1 log below,
and at the estimated LoD for that virus (based on preliminary studies). Two dilution
series were prepared for each viral stock by two operators for a total of 4 dilution series
per virus. An Internal RNA Control (IC) was spiked into all dilution series samples
prior to nucleic acid isolation. The IC monitors for PCR inhibition as well as any
reagent, procedural or instrumentation failure. Each dilution series was extracted on the
Roche MagNA Pure LC and tested in quintuplicate reactions using two lots of Pro
hMPV+ reagents on four Cepheid SmartCycler II instruments. This resulted in a total of
20 data points per viral strain dilution. A negative control, which consisted of negative
NP swab matrix spiked with IC was included with each set of dilution series. Nucleic
11

--- Page 12 ---
acid isolation of the negative control was performed along with the viral strain dilution
series. The negative control served to monitor for contamination during the testing
procedure or the presence of inhibitors in the sample matrix. The hMPV Positive RNA
Control, non-infectious in vitro transcribed RNA of a specific viral sequence, was
included with each RNA detection run to test for procedural errors (absence of reagent,
instrument failure, etc.).
Analytical sensitivity was determined for each strain. The LoD was defined as the
lowest concentration that was detected ≥95% of the time (i.e. concentration at which at
least 19 out of 20 replicates were determined to be positive). The data are presented in
the following table:

Extraction Equivalency Study
To evaluate the equivalency of nucleic acid extraction using the Roche MagNA Pure
LC (used throughout Pro hMPV+ Assay development and Analytical Studies, Clinical
Trials and Reproducibility) and the bioMérieux NucliSens easyMAG automated
extraction instruments (used in Clinical Trials and Reproducibility) for use with the Pro
hMPV+ Assay, an extraction equivalency study was carried out to determine and
compare the Limits of Detection (LoDs) for human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) on each
automated extractor.
The Roche MagNA Pure LC is an automated nucleic acid isolation and purification
system based upon binding of nucleic acids to glass particles and has the capability to
process a total of 32 reactions within one run. Nucleic acid is purified in multiple plastic
reaction tips and cartridges by several steps that include cell lysis and binding of nucleic
acid to magnetic glass particles, wash steps, and a heated elution to unbind the nucleic
acid from the glass particles.
The bioMérieux NucliSens easyMAG is an automated nucleic acid isolation and
purification system that is based upon the same silica extraction technology as the
MagNA Pure. The easyMAG is capable of processing a total of 24 reactions with

variable sample types, sample volumes, and elution volumes within a single run.
Nucleic acid is purified within a single cartridge by several steps that include lysis and
binding of nucleic acid to high affinity magnetic silica beads, a series of wash steps and
heated elution of purified nucleic acid from the silica beads.
For the Extraction Equivalency LoD Study, single cultured and titered strains of hMPV
A2 (Iowa 14 strain) and hMPV B2 (Iowa 8 strain) were spiked (along with an IC) into
individual aliquots of negative nasopharyngeal swab (NP) matrix pools at
concentrations of 1 log above, at, and 1 log below the previously determined LoD (see
LoD studies using the Roche MagNA Pure LC). Each viral strain dilution was extracted
in replicates of 10 on each automated extractor. An Extraction Control and a Negative
Control (NP spiked with Internal Control - NPIC) were included in each run on each
extractor. All samples of the same virus strain and same dilution were extracted on the
same day in the same extraction run. All extracted nucleic acid samples were stored at ≤
-70ºC until testing was performed.
Testing with the Pro hMPV+ Assay occurred within two weeks of extraction. The 10
extractions of each of the three concentrations from both extraction instruments (total of
60 samples) for a specific virus were tested using the Pro hMPV+ Assay (a single Pro
hMPV+ mastermix). Included with each run was the hMPV RNA Positive Control and
the relevant NPICs from each automated extraction run for the specific samples being
tested. A total of 10 data points were generated at each dilution per virus per extraction
instrument. Results were analyzed and reported as specified in the Pro hMPV+
Instructions for Use. This study was limited to one operator, one extraction instrument
(one easyMAG and one MagNA Pure LC), one lot of instrument specific extraction
reagents per instrument (each automated extractor requires different extraction
reagents), one lot of Pro hMPV+ reagents, and a single dilution series per virus.
LoDs for each virus were determined by ≥95% positivity at a specific concentration and
are presented in the following table:

of replicates at all concentrations were detected with both extraction systems.
This study demonstrated that the Roche MagNA Pure LC and the bioMérieux
NucliSens easyMAG automated extraction instruments perform equivalently
based on Analytical Sensitivity. Clinical trial and reproducibility studies also
support the equivalence of both automated extraction systems.
e. Analytical Reactivity:
The analytical reactivity of the Pro hMPV+ Assay was determined for the following
additional hMPV viral strains:
Strains
human Metapneumovirus A1
human Metapneumovirus A2
human Metapneumovirus B1
human Metapneumovirus B2
The cultured and titered strains used to evaluate the reactivity of the Pro hMPV+
Assay were tested at a concentration of 101 TCID /mL. All hMPV strains were
50
obtained from ViroNovative (Rotterdam, Netherlands) and cultured and titered by the
City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory. The Analytical Reactivity Panel
was prepared by spiking the above listed viruses into aliquots from negative
nasopharyngeal (NP) swab pools. An Internal RNA Control (IC) was spiked into each
sample prior to nucleic acid isolation. The IC monitors for PCR inhibition as well as
any reagent, procedural or instrumentation failure. A negative NP swab sample spiked
with the Internal Control and an M4 Viral Transport Media-only sample spiked with
the Internal Control were included in the Reactivity Panel and were extracted along
with the Reactivity Panel samples. The negative controls served to monitor for
contamination during the testing procedure. Samples were extracted on the Roche
MagNA Pure LC and tested in triplicate PCR reactions using one lot of Pro hMPV+
reagents. The hMPV Positive RNA Control, non-infectious in vitro transcribed RNA
of a specific viral sequence, was included with each run to test for procedural errors
(absence of reagent, instrument failure, etc.).

f. Analytical specificity:
The analytical specificity of the Pro hMPV+ Assay was determined with 52 viral,
bacterial and yeast (28 viruses, 23 bacteria and 1 yeast) strains of common respiratory
pathogens or flora commonly present in the nasopharynx. All the viral strains were
obtained from ATCC or University of Iowa and cultured and titered by Tricore
Reference Laboratories (Albuquerque, NM). The majority of cultured and titered
bacterial and yeast strains were obtained from MicroBioLogics, Inc. (St. Cloud, MN) or
from ATCC and cultured and titered by the Clinical Microbiology Laboratories at
Resurrection Medical Center (Chicago, IL) and Waukesha Memorial Hospital
(Waukesha, WI). None of the facilities listed above were able to provide fresh cultured
and titered stocks of C. pneumoniae or C. trachomatis. Additional laboratories
(commercial and private) were contacted, but none were able to provide titered cultures
at a reasonable cost and timeframe. Thus, ATCC frozen cultures were used and ATCC
supplied titers were used for C. pneumoniae and C. trachomatis.
Aliquots of a negative nasopharyngeal (NP) swab pool matrix were spiked with the
analytical specificity organisms at concentrations of 102 – 106 TCID /ml for viruses
50
and 106 – 7.4x107 CFU/ml for the bacterial and yeast strains. The Pro hMPV+ Internal
Control (IC) was spiked into all samples prior to nucleic acid isolation. A Negative
Control, which consisted of the M4 viral transport media spiked with the IC, was
included and nucleic acid isolation of the negative control was performed along with
Analytical Specificity Panel samples. The Pro hMPV+ Positive Control and was
included with each detection run to test for global failure. The Analytical Specificity
Panel samples and the Negative Control were extracted on the Roche MagNA Pure LC
and tested in triplicate on a Cepheid SmartCycler II using one lot of Pro hMPV+
reagents.
The Pro hMPV+ Assay did not cross-react with any of the Analytical Specificity Panel
samples tested. Detailed Analytical Specificity results are presented in the following

g. Assay cut-off:
The “cutoff value” represents the fluorescent intensity signal (reported in Relative
Fluorescent Units) at which a “positive” reaction reaches a relative fluorescent
intensity above the background or baseline of a “negative” reaction. If a sample
exceeds the threshold in a detection channel during PCR, the sample is considered
positive for that channel. If the sample does not exceed the threshold for a detection
channel by the last PCR cycle, the sample is considered negative for that channel.
Cutoff Determination and Confirmation studies were conducted with two operators
and two reagent lots. The reagent lots varied in raw material lots, personnel, and

facility in which they were manufactured. Cutoff values (RFUs) were determined upon
completion of the Cutoff Determination Study which included a training set of
simulated samples. The training set of 66 samples contained two levels of each virus
(hMPV subtype A1, A2, B1 and B2), a negative nasopharyngeal (NP) swab sample
with and without Internal Control (NIC), a negative viral transport media control, and
the hMPV Positive Control. The cutoff values were then verified in the Cutoff
Confirmation Study against a set of clinical samples and controls (20 hMPV positive
samples and 24 negative samples; 16 NTC and 4 PC). The determined cutoff was
confirmed if ≥90% sensitivity and specificity was attained for each channel with the
above mentioned set of clinical samples and controls.
The cutoffs used in the Cutoff Determination and Confirmation Studies are presented
in the following table:

The hazard of an hMPV false positive is greater than a false negative so a higher
threshold carries less risk for a patient. A false negative would probably not alter the
clinical treatment of a patient presenting with upper respiratory symptoms, but a false
positive might result in improper treatment and/or preclude the detection of a more
serious pathogen.
Analysis settings and threshold settings were determined for FAM (30) and Cy5
(22) channels representing hMPV and IC detection, respectively. These settings
produced 100% sensitivity and specificity in the verification set of samples used during
Cutoff Confirmation and met acceptance criteria for the study. Therefore, the cutoff
values are confirmed as the acceptable for use during the clinical trials.

i. Interfering Substances:
An interfering substances study was carried out to examine whether a panel of
endogenous and exogenous potential RT-PCR inhibitors affected the performance
of the Pro hMPV+ assay. Blood, mucin, or medications (prescription and over-the-
counter) for relief of congestion, sore throat, allergy and asthma symptoms were
spiked into simulated hMPV positive NP samples. Two subtypes of hMPV (A2 and
B2) were used and spiked into NP pools at either 2X Limit of Detection (LoD) or
10X LoD. Clinically relevant amounts of the potential inhibiting substances were
added to spiked samples. An Internal Control (IC) was added to each sample.
Nucleic acid from the samples was extracted with the Roche MagNA Pure LC.
Pro hMPV+ was performed in triplicate reactions for each sample on the Cepheid
SmartCycler II. Any substance in which detection of hMPV at 10X LoD was not
observed was considered an inhibitor of PCR. A Negative Control, which consisted
of M4 viral transport media spiked with an IC, was included with Interfering
Substances Panel samples. The Pro hMPV+ Positive Control and was included with
each detection run to test for global errors.
The following table shows the interfering substances used for this study. As
described in the justification column, the concentrations spiked directly into
samples ranged from approximately 2% to 15% of recommended dose for some
substances, while others were tested at concentrations reported in scientific
literature or in references from other IVD package inserts. The substances consisted
of nasal sprays (liquid and powder), ingestible pills and lozenges, injectables, and
endogenous substances (blood and mucin).

j. Internal Control Interference:
Competitive inhibition of the Pro hMPV+ Assay due to the presence of the IC was
assessed. Simulated samples were tested with and without IC to determine if the
presence of the IC inhibited the reaction. Two sets of IC Interference Panel members
were prepared by spiking serial dilutions of cultured and titered (TCID /mL) strains
50
of human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) subtype A2 and B2 into individual aliquots of
negative nasopharyngeal (NP) swab pools at concentrations of 1 log below and at the
Limit of Detection (LoD) (as determined in the Analytical Sensitivity Study). The IC
was added to one set of IC Interference Panel samples prior to nucleic acid isolation;
the second set did not contain the IC. Two negative controls were generated which
consisted of negative NP swab matrix with or without the Internal Control. Nucleic
acid isolation of the negative controls was performed along with the IC Interference
Panel samples. The negative control served to monitor for contamination during the
testing procedure or in the case of negative control spiked with IC, also served to
monitor for the presence of inhibitors in the sample matrix. The hMPV Positive RNA
Control was included with each RT-PCR run to test for global errors (absence of
reagent, instrument failure, etc.). The Positive Control does not require nucleic acid
isolation and was diluted just prior to set up of RT-PCR reactions. Nucleic acid from
each sample was isolated in duplicate extractions on the Roche MagNA Pure LC. The
purified nucleic acids from each duplicate extraction were combined (100 µL total
volume) and tested with the Pro hMPV+ Assay in 10 replicate reactions using 1 lot of

Pro hMPV+ reagents on the Cepheid Smartcycler II (Dx Software Version 1.7b). This
resulted in a total of 10 data points for each viral strain at each concentration spiked
with IC and 10 data points for each viral strain at each concentration without the IC.
Competitive inhibition of the IC was assessed by comparing the percent of samples
detected at concentrations of 1 log below and at the LoD of each viral strain when
spiked with or without the IC. Competitive inhibition was to be considered if the
presence of the IC decreased the sensitivity (LoD) of the Pro hMPV+ Assay.
No competitive inhibition at the assay LoD was observed for detection of hMPV
in the presence IC using the Pro hMPV+ Assay.
k. Carry-Over Contamination:
To evaluate the degree of carry-over/cross-contamination that occurs with the use of
the Pro hMPV+ Assay in association with nucleic acid extraction on the Roche
MagNA Pure LC and the bioMérieux NucliSens easyMAG instruments and PCR on
the Cepheid SmartCycler II thermocycler, an internal Carry-Over study was carried
out by testing simulated human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) high positive samples run
in series alternating with hMPV high negative samples (i.e. “checkerboard” pattern).
The high hMPV positive samples in this study represented the lower Cycle Threshold
(Ct) range (higher sample titer range) obtained in the Pro hMPV+ clinical trials
(lowest Ct = 17.9). To achieve this, the Extraction Control, an inactivated non-
infectious A2 strain of hMPV, was spiked into negative nasopharyngeal (NP) swab
matrix at approximately 6 logs above the organism’s limit of detection (LoD) along
with an Internal Control (IC). The high negative samples contained the analyte at a
concentration below the detection limit such that repeat testing of the sample would
be negative approximately 95% of the time. High negative samples were generated by
spiking hMPV into negative NP swab matrix at approximately 2 logs below the
organism’s LoD. A negative control (viral transport medium) spiked with the IC was
also included with each extraction run.
A total of 22 high positive and 22 high negative samples and 2 Negative Controls
were generated to be run on the Roche MagNA Pure LC. A total of 11 high positive
and 11 high negative samples and a Negative Controls were generated to be run on
the bioMérieux NucliSens easyMAG. Total nucleic acid was extracted in a pattern of
alternating high-positive and high-negative samples on each extraction instrument
(Roche MagNA Pure LC and bioMérieux NucliSens easyMAG). Purified nucleic acid
from each sample as well as the hMPV+ Positive RNA Control were tested in single
reactions using 1 lot of Pro hMPV+ reagents.
One high-negative sample showed potential hMPV contamination when extracted
using the MagNA Pure extraction system. Contamination could have occurred during
creation of the sample, during sample preparation for extraction, during extraction or
when transferring the purified nucleic acid samples from the sample cartridge to
microfuge tubes. (Note: since the high-negative samples include low amount of
21

--- Page 22 ---
hMPV that is detectable less than 5% of the time, the possibility of this sample
actually being a sample that falls in the 5% category can not be ruled out). Correlation
to expected results for the MagNA Pure and easyMAG across all samples was 95.7%
(44/46) and 100% (23/23) respectively.
This Pro hMPV+ Carryover Study demonstrated that low level carry-over/cross
contamination with the Pro hMPV+ Assay using either the Roche MagNA Pure LC or
the bioMériuex NucliSens easyMAG automated nucleic acid extraction instruments
and the Cepheid Smartcycler II could happen. Therefore, the following statements
were included in the Limitations section to address the potential of cross-
contamination when performing the assay: “The detection of viral nucleic acid is
dependent upon proper specimen collection, handling, transportation, storage,
and preparation (including extraction). Failure to observe proper procedures in
any one of these steps can lead to incorrect results.” “There is a risk of false
positive values resulting from cross-contamination by target organism or its
nucleic acids.”
l. Comparator Assays Analytical Validation Studies
The hMPV Comparator Assays are 2-Step RT-PCR assays which target conserved
regions of the hMPV Nucleocapsid or Fusion gene. To validate the analytical
performance of the hMPV Nucleocapsid (N) Reference Assay and the hMPV Fusion
(F) Reference Assay used as the comparison methods to the Pro hMPV+ Assay for
the Pro hMPV+ Clinical Study, the following analytical studies were independently
performed: Analytical Sensitivity, Reactivity and Analytical Specificity.
Analytical Sensitivity
Analytical Sensitivity was performed with viruses obtained from University of Iowa
and were subsequently cultured and titered by ZeptoMetrix Corporation and TriCore
Laboratories. Analytical Sensitivity was determined using two (A2 and B2) of the
four (A1, A2, B1 and B2) sub-lineages of hMPV. Each virus was serially diluted in
negative NP swab matrix and tested minimally at three concentrations: 1 log above, 1
log below and at the expected LoD (determined by Pro hMPV+ Assay Analytical
Sensitivity Study). Internal RNA Control (IC) was also spiked into samples. A single
operator generated 2 dilution series for each lineage and each dilution series was
extracted along with a corresponding negative NP+ IC sample using the Roche
MagNA Pure LC System. RT-PCR was performed in triplicate for each dilution series
with both hMPV N and F Reference Assays. A total of 6 data points per virus
concentration for both the hMPV N and F Reference Assays were generated. PCR
products were analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis and were determined hMPV
positive if the band size was within an established range of the theoretical PCR target
size for each assay and had an band intensity maximum (Imax) three standard
deviations above the background (yielding a cutoff value of 29).
The LoD for hMPV A2 was 102 TCID /ml and the LoD for B2 was 101 TCID /ml

Analytical reactivity
The analytical reactivity of the Reference Assays was evaluated with subtypes A , A ,
1 2
B , and B clinical isolates of human Metapneumovirus that were cultured and titered
1 2
by an independent laboratory and were not the same strains used in the Analytical
Sensitivity studies. hMPV sub-lineages were tested at approximately 101 TCID /ml.
50
This study utilized the leftover extracted nucleic acid from the Pro hMPV+ Assay
Reactivity Study (described in Section 5.1.2 of this submission), which was stored at
≤-70°C from extraction until its use in this study. RT-PCR was performed in duplicate
with the N and F Reference Assays for each sample and PCR products generated were
analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR products were determined hMPV
positive if band size was within an established range of the theoretical PCR target size
for each assay and were above the established cutoff intensity.
Each of the four hMPV strains was detected with both Reference Assays as shown in
the following table:

Analytical Specificity
Analytical Specificity is defined as the ability of the assay to exclusively identify a
target organism with no cross-reactivity with organisms that are closely related or
cause similar disease syndromes as the targeted organism (hMPV) or with organisms
present as normal flora in nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Analytical Specificity

testing for both N and F Reference Assays was performed using the panel of nucleic
acid that was prepared for the Pro hMPV+ Assay Analytical Specificity Study. The
Analytical Specificity panel included nucleic acids extracted from 28 viruses, 25
bacteria and one yeast that were cultured and titered by other reference laboratories.
These nucleic acids were stored at <-70ºC since the Pro hMPV+ Analytical
Specificity testing. RT-PCR was performed with the N and F Reference Assays and
PCR products generated were analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR
products were determined hMPV positive if band size was within an established range
of the theoretical PCR target size for each assay and was above the established cutoff
intensity.
Both Reference Assays demonstrated 100% specificity and data is presented in the
follow table:

Based on thorough analytical validations, the hMPV N and F Reference Assays
are acceptable methods to be used as composite reference methods in
determining “clinical diagnostic truth” for the Pro hMPV+ Clinical Trial. Both
the N and F Reference Assays performed equivalently to the Pro hMPV+ Assay
for Analytical Sensitivity, Reactivity, and Analytical Specificity.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable.
b. Matrix Description and Comparison:
Analytical performance of the Pro hMPV+ Assay using three different viral transport
media (VTM) (2 that were used for sample collection in the Pro hMPV+ clinical trials
and one that was used for ProFlu+ clinical trials) was evaluated. Analytical
sensitivity was determined using cultured and titered strains of human
Metapneumovirus (hMPV) subtypes A2 (Iowa 14 strain) and B2 (Iowa 8 strain)
spiked into each of the different VTM. The VTM were considered “equivalent” if the
same Limits of Detection (LoD) were achieved for each.
The intended use of VTM is for the transport of clinical specimens containing viruses,
chlamydiae, mycoplasma, and ureaplasma from the collection site to the laboratory
for microbiological procedures. The three VTM evaluated in this study: M4 (Remel,
Lenexa, KS), Copan Mini UTM (Copan, Murrieta, CA) and BD UTM (Becton
Dickinson, Sparks, MD) are identical in composition with the exception that Copan
UTM and BD UTM include L- Cysteine whereas M4 does not.

Cultured and titered human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) strains (subtypes A2 and B2)
were diluted at one log above, at, and at one log below their previously determined
limit of detection into each of three different VTM: M4, Copan UTM, and BD UTM
to generate simulated positive samples (n = 8 data points per virus per concentration).
Samples were extracted using the Roche MagNA Pure LC and tested in triplicate PCR
reactions on the Cepheid Smartcycler II using one lot of Pro hMPV+ reagents. An
Internal Control (IC) was spiked into all VTM study samples prior to nucleic acid
isolation. The IC monitors for PCR inhibition as well as any reagent, procedural or
instrumentation failure. Negative controls, consisting of each of the three different
VTM spiked with IC were tested in duplicate in each run. Nucleic acid isolation of the
negative controls was performed along with the VTM study samples. The negative
controls serve to monitor for contamination or the presence of inhibitors. The hMPV
RNA Positive Control, non-infectious in vitro transcribed RNA, was included with
each run to test for global errors (absence of reagents, instrument failure, etc.). The
Positive Control did not require nucleic acid isolation and was used just prior to set up
of RT-PCR reactions.
Each of the three VTM performed “equivalently” at the Limit of Detection (LoD) as
determined in a separate Analytical Sensitivity Study and average Ct values at each
concentration tested were comparable among all three VTM. Detailed data are
presented in the following table:

All three VTM evaluated are compatible with the Pro hMPV+ Assay. The three
VTM met the LoD that was previously established with Remel M4 in the Analytical
Sensitivity Study.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Prospective Clinical studies
Performance characteristics of the Pro hMPV+ Assay were established during
prospective studies at 4 U.S. clinical laboratories during the 2008 respiratory virus season
(January - March). All specimens used in the study meeting the inclusion and exclusion
criteria represented excess, remnants of nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens that were
prospectively collected from symptomatic individuals suspected of respiratory infection,
and were submitted for routine care or analysis by each site, and that otherwise would
have been discarded. Individual specimens were delinked from all patient identifiers and
given a study sample code. All clinical sites were granted waivers of informed consent by
their IRBs for this study. Inclusion criteria included, but were not limited to: the specimen
was from a symptomatic patient (for respiratory infection); the specimen was a NP swab
in appropriate transport media (i.e. Remel M4 or Copan UTM viral transport medium);
the specimen contained adequate volume for performing the Pro hMPV+ Assay; age and
gender information were available; specimen was stored properly (refrigerated at 2oC –
8oC); and initiation of the Pro hMPV+ assay (nucleic acid extraction) took place within
72 hours of sample collection.
Performance of the Pro hMPV+ Assay was assessed and compared to a predetermined
algorithm that used composite reference methods. The composite reference methods
consisted of two independent molecular (RT-PCR) tests for two separate gene targets of
hMPV followed by bi-directional genetic sequencing. The two reference tests targeted the
Nucleocapsid gene (different region of the gene than targeted by the Pro hMPV+ assay)
and the Fusion gene. “True” hMPV RNA positives were considered as any sample that
had bi-directional sequencing data meeting pre-defined quality acceptance criteria, for
one or both gene targets that matched hMPV sequences deposited in the National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), with
acceptable E-values. “True” hMPV RNA negatives were considered as any sample that
was tested negative by both of the comparator methods. The E-values generated from the
clinical trial range from a low of 1e-52 to a high of 1e-23. The E-Value from NCBI
BLAST Alignment indicates the statistical significance of a given pair-wise alignment
and reflects the size of the database and the scoring system used. The lower the E-Value,
the more significant the hit. A sequence alignment that has an E-Value of 1e-3 means that
this similarity has a 1 in 1000 chance of occurring by chance alone.
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=handbook.section.614).
Therefore an E-Value ranging from 1e-23 to 1e-52 has a very low probability of
occurring purely by chance.
A total of 1275 eligible NP swab samples (617 from female patients, 654 from male
27

--- Page 28 ---
patients, and for 4 samples gender was not specified) were tested with the Pro hMPV+
Assay at the 4 clinical sites and by the composite reference methods at Prodesse. The NP
swab specimens underwent nucleic acid extraction using either the Roche MagNA Pure
Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit on the MagNA Pure LC Instrument (Site 4) or using the
bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG instrument with Automated Magnetic Extraction
Reagents (Sites 1, 2, 3). An Internal RNA Control (IC) was added to every NP swab
sample. A Negative Control which consisted of viral transport medium and an Extraction
Control, non-infectious hMPV strain (A2 lineage), were included with each extraction
run. Nucleic acid detection was performed using the Pro hMPV+ Assay on the Cepheid
SmartCycler II. Remaining nucleic acids were frozen at -700C, sent back to Prodesse and
tested with the two independent reference RT-PCR assays. Samples that yielded a
positive result by gel electrophoresis were sent for bi-directional sequencing.
The overall assay failure rate of the Pro hMPV+ Assay during the clinical trials due to
failure of positive, negative or extraction controls was 0% (total of 65 runs across all 4
sites). On two occasions slight contamination of the Internal Control appeared in the
Positive Control (Ct = 42.0 (Site 1) and Ct = 40.6 (Site 3) and on two occasions in the
Extraction Control (Ct = 42.7 (Site 1) and Ct = 39.8 (Site 2)). As this does not affect the
sample results, the runs were accepted as valid.
A total of 1,338 NP swab specimens were initially included for the clinical trial. 39
specimens (18 from Site 1, 11 from Site 2, none from Site 3, and 10 from Site 4) were
excluded from the clinical study due to >72 hours from time of collection to Pro hMPV+
Assay testing. 1 specimen (Site 4) was excluded due to failed NA extraction. Of the Pro
hMPV+ Assay run on all eligible specimens, 98.1% (1273/1298) of these specimens were
successful on the first attempt (Site 1: 424/443 = 95.7%; Site 2: 279/284 = 98.2%; Site 3:
356/356 = 100%; Site 4: 214/215 = 99.5%). The remaining 25 gave “Unresolved” results
on the first attempt (19 from Site 1, 5 from Site 2, none from Site 3, and 1 from Site 4).
Unresolved results occur when the sample is negative for both hMPV and the Internal
Control, indicating potentially PCR-inhibiting samples. Of the 25 “Unresolved”
specimens on the first attempt with sufficient sample for retest, only 8.0% (2/25) gave a
valid “negative” result on the second attempt (1 from Site 2 and 1 from Site 4). The
remaining 23 were “Unresolved” on the second attempt, therefore, were not eligible for
inclusion in the data analysis. All 23 samples were tested negative by the composite
reference methods.
Site poolability of performance data was determined based on the fact that similar
Pro hMPV+ performance were obtained from the 4 clinical sites:
Site 1: Sensitivity 90.0% (95% CI: 59.6% - 98.2%); Specificity 99.8% (95% CI: 98.6% - 100%)
Site 2: Sensitivity 92.3% (95% CI: 75.9% - 97.9%); Specificity 100% (95% CI: 98.5% - 100%)
Site 3: Sensitivity 96.7% (95% CI: 83.8% - 99.4%); Specificity 97.8% (95% CI: 95.6% - 99.0%)
Site 4: Sensitivity 100% (95% CI: 34.2% - 100%); Specificity 100% (95% CI: 98.2% - 100%)

The Cepheid Smart Cycler II Real Time instrument with Dx software version 1.7b or
3.0a is used to perform real time reverse transcription, PCR amplification and detection
of nucleic acid. Four other nucleic acid amplification tests that use the Smart Cycler II
instrument have received 510(k) clearance: Prodesse’s ProFlu+ Assay (K081030), IDI-
MRSA test (K033415), the IDI-Strep B Assay (K022504), and the Influenza A/H5
(Asian lineage) Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Primer and Probe Set (K060159). The
Cepheid SmartCycler instrument is an integrated nucleic acid amplification and
detection instrument system based on Cepheid’s proprietary microprocessor-controlled
I-CORE module. For purified RNA samples, the SmartCycler instrument enables
reverse-transcriptase (RT) to transcribe target viral RNA into cDNA, polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) for the amplification of cDNA, and hybridization of fluorogenic target-
specific probes for the detection of the amplified cDNA.
The Roche MagNA Pure LC is an automated nucleic acid isolation and purification
system based upon binding of nucleic acids to glass particles and has the capability to
process a total of 32 reactions within one run. Nucleic acid is purified in multiple plastic

reaction tips and cartridges by several steps that include cell lysis and binding of nucleic
acid to magnetic glass particles, wash steps, and a heated elution to unbind the nucleic
acid from the glass particles. Three other tests that use the Roche MagNA Pure LC
system have received 510(k) clearance: Prodesse’s ProFlu+ Assay (K081030), Roche
Factor V Leiden Kit (K033607) and the Roche Factor II (Prothrombin) G20210A Kit
(K033612).
The bioMérieux NucliSens easyMAG is an automated nucleic acid isolation and
purification system that is based upon the same silica extraction technology as the
MagNA Pure. The easyMAG is capable of processing a total of 24 reactions with
variable sample types, sample volumes, and elution volumes within a single run.
Nucleic acid is purified within a single cartridge by several steps that include lysis and
binding of nucleic acid to high affinity magnetic silica beads, a series of wash steps and
heated elution of purified nucleic acid from the silica beads. Prodesse’s ProFlu+ Assay
(K081030) that received Special 510(k) clearance also uses the easyMAG system for
automated nucleic acid extraction.

6. Quality Control:
The following controls are provided in the Pro hMPV+ Assay kit:
Positive Control (PC): The Pro hMPV+ Assay kit contains an hMPV positive RNA
control that is an RNA transcript of a plasmid containing the viral sequence of interest
and is not intact virus particles. The PC does not go through nucleic acid isolation and
purification, but is included during set-up of the RT-PCR reaction. The PC in
conjunction with the IC is used to verify reagent and system performance.

Internal Control (IC): An Internal RNA Control, a non-infectious RNA transcript, is
incorporated into every sample and is carried through all steps of the procedure from
nucleic acid isolation and purification through amplification to monitor for inhibitors
present in the specimen or reaction tube. The IC also serves as a general process control
ensuring that each step of the procedure was performed correctly, assay and instrument
parameters were set correctly, and that general reagents were working.
The following controls are not provided in the Pro hMPV+ Assay kit, but are required
or recommended and described in the Pro hMPV+ Assay Instructions for Use:
Negative Control (NC): A Negative Control (NC) is not provided with the kit, but is
required and described in the Pro hMPV+ Assay Instructions for Use. Viral transport
media spiked with the IC is to be used as the negative control and processed starting
from nucleic acid isolation. The negative control serves to monitor for contamination.
Extraction Control (EC): An Extraction Control (EC) is not provided with the kit,
however, during the clinical trial, a non-infectious hMPV strain (A2 lineage) obtained
from ZeptoMetrix Corp. (Buffalo, NY), was included with each extraction run as EC.
The sponsor is recommending this extraction control to the end users in the
package insert.
