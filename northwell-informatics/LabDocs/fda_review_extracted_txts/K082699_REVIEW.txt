I. Device Description:
All reagents, controls and calibrators are sold separately.
a. Elecsys Troponin I Immunoassay and Elecsys Troponin I STAT
Immunoassays: The Elecsys Troponin I and Troponin I STAT
immunoassays are two step sandwich immunoassays with streptavidin
microparticles and electrochemiluminescence detection. Results are
determined using a calibration curve that is generated specifically on each
instrument by a 2 point calibration and a master curve provided with the
reagent bar code. The Elecsys Troponin I STAT immunoassay is completed
in half time when compared to the Elecsys Troponin I immunoassay,
however the composition of the reagents is identical.
b. Elecsys PreciControl Troponin: The Elecsys PreciControl Troponin is a
lyophilized product consisting of human serum containing Troponin I in two
concentration ranges and Troponin T. Although the control contains both
Troponin subunits, only the Troponin I has assayed values. This material is
not for use with Troponin T assays. All products derived from human blood
are prepared exclusively from the blood of donors tested individually and
shown to be free from HBsAg and antibodies to HCV and HIV. The testing
methods applied were FDA-approved or cleared in compliance with the
European Directive 98/79/EC, Annex II, List A.
c. Elecsys Troponin I CalSet and Elecsys Troponin I STAT CalSet: The
Elecsys Troponin I CalSet and Elecsys Troponin I STAT CalSet are
lyophilized products consisting of human serum with added Troponin I in
two concentration ranges. During manufacture the analyte is spiked into the
matrix at the desired concentration levels. All products derived from
human blood are prepared exclusively from the blood of donors tested
individually and shown to be free from HBsAg and antibodies to HCV and
HIV. The testing methods applied were FDA-approved or cleared in

L. Test Principle:
The Elecsys Troponin I Immunoassay and Elecsys Troponin I STAT Immunoassays
use a sandwich principle for measurement of troponin I in serum or plasma. Two
biotinylated monoclonal cardiac troponin I-specific antibodies labeled with a
ruthenium complex react to form a sandwich complex during the first incubation
period. Then, streptavidin-coated microparticles are added resulting in the binding of
the complex to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin. This occurs
during a second incubation phase. Once this incubation is completed, the reaction
mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically
captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then removed
with a wash. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent
emission which is measured by a photomultiplier. Results are determined via a
calibration curve which is instrument-specifically generated by 2-point calibration
and a master curve (5-point calibration) provided via the reagent barcode. The
differences between the Elecsys Troponin I Immunoassay and Elecsys Troponin I
STAT Immunoassays are that the STAT assay is completed in half the time as the
other assay and is limited to use on specific analyzers.
The PreciControl Troponin contains two concentrations of troponin I and is used for
monitoring the accuracy and precision of the Elecsys Troponin I and Elecsys
Troponin I STAT immunoassays.
The Elecsys Troponin I CalSet and STAT CalSet are calibrators containing two
concentrations of troponin I. All calibration information is included on a barcoded
card which is loaded into the respective instrument systems.

Elecsys Troponin I immunoassay and Elecsys Troponin I STAT:
Precision was evaluated using multiple serum or plasma pools. Samples were
analyzed at a total of six laboratories within the US and outside of the US.
Some laboratories had duplicate instrumentation and precision was performed
on both analyzers. Samples were assayed in duplicate with a minimum of two
runs per day using one reagent lot. Several sites did separate runs of serum
and/or human plasma (HP) or had duplicate instrumentation indicated by #.
The low control was also evaluated on both analyzers. The sponsor is using
0.3 ng/mL as the low limit of the measuring range based on precision of ≤
10% CV at that value.

MODULAR Analytics E170. Three separate dilution series were prepared
from three separate serum pools. Each high pool was assayed multiple times
to determine the mean value prior to dilution. The samples were analyzed in
three separate runs. Only native samples were used for this study. Diluent
was used for a troponin free sample. Each serum pool was serially diluted to
make 10 different concentrations. Each dilution was tested in triplicate and
the median value was compared to the expected value. Linearity and
recoveries were calculated against the expected values after dilution using
Passing-Bablock, linear, and Deming regressions. Troponin I concentrations
covered the measuring range of the assay.

Elecsys Troponin I STAT immunoassay:
Linearity was evaluated on the Roche Elecsys 2010. Three separate serum
pools were prepared and dilutions and analysis used the same process as for
the Elecsys Troponin I reagent. Each high pool was assayed multiple times to
determine the mean value prior to dilution. Only native samples were used for
this study. Diluent was used for a troponin free sample. Troponin I
concentrations covered the measuring range of the assay.

The sponsor is claiming a measuring range for both assays of 0.30 – 25.0
ng/mL (mcg/L). Values above the measuring range are reported as > 25.0
ng/mL (mcg/L). Values < 0.3 ng/mL are reported as < 0.3 ng/mL.
High dose hook effect was evaluated by testing normal human sera spiked
with troponin I at 1,070 ng/mL and 1,300 ng/mL. There was no hook effect
observed up to 1,300 ng/mL, however the sponsor sets the hook effect claim
at 1,000 ng/mL in the labeling.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators
Elecsys Troponin I CalSet and Elecsys Troponin I STAT CalSet are traceable
master calibrators which are standardized against another commercially
available troponin I assay. Master calibrator value assignment occurs after 2
independent series are analyzed on 4 reference instruments. New lots of
Troponin I CalSet and Troponin I STAT CalSet are analyzed multiple times
against the master calibrators on the appropriate platform. The target value for
the calibrators is then calculated as the median of the determined values.
Controls
Elecsys PreciControl Troponin is traceable to analysis against the master
calibrators on the aforementioned platforms using specific reagent lots and
multiple runs per instrument. The target values for the controls are then
calculated as the median of the determined values.
Stability
The calibrators and controls are lyophilized. After reconstitution, they are
stable for on-board the instruments for 5 hours, four days after opening at 2-8°
C and 3 months at -20°C. Controls and calibrators should only be thawed
once.
On-board calibration stability was verified on the Elecsys 2010 and the
MODULAR Analytics E170 by measuring troponin I recovery in controls and
human serum samples. Calibration is recommended every 7 days if the kit is
not consumed and every 4 weeks with the same reagent lot and the reagent
pack is consumed within 7 days.
The stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
Limits of Blank (LoB) and Limits of Detection (LoD) for Elecsys Troponin I
and Elecsys Troponin I STAT were evaluated using CLSI EP17-A guideline.
Limits of Quantitation (LoQ) for the two devices were established by
determining the concentration with corresponds to an inter-assay CV of 10%.
Studies were performed on analytical platforms appropriate to the devices.
Elecsys Troponin I:
LoB was determined by analyzing 5 troponin I free human serum samples on

--- Page 14 ---
one MODULAR Analytics E170 in singlicate in 6 runs over four days. LoB is
< 0.3 ng/mL however, the sponsor is using the LoQ, 0.3 ng/mL, as the lowest
limit of the measuring range.
LoD was determined by analyzing 5 human sera containing low amounts of
troponin I on one MODULAR Analytics E170 in singlicate in 6 runs over
three days. LoD < 0.3 ng/mL however the sponsor is using the LoQ, 0.3
ng/mL, as the lowest limit of the measuring range.
LoQ was determined by analyzing 6 serum samples and two controls with
concentrations ranging from 0.0251 ng/mL to 17.1026 ng/mL were tested in
singlicate on one MODULAR Analytics E170 for 10 days. The concentration
with an inter-assay ≤ 10% CV was 0.3 ng/mL. The sponsor is using the LoQ
as the lowest limit of the measuring range.
Elecsys Troponin I STAT:
LoB was determined by analyzing 5 troponin I free human serum samples on
two Elecsys 2010s in 6 runs over four days. LoB < 0.3 ng/mL. The sponsor is
using the LoQ, 0.3 ng/mL, as the lowest limit of the measuring range.
LoD was determined by analyzing 5 human sera containing low amounts of
troponin I on two Elecsys 2010s in 6 runs over three days. LoD < 0.3 ng/mL.
The sponsor is using the LoQ, 0.3 ng/mL, as the lowest limit of the measuring
range.
LoQ was determined by analyzing 10 serum samples and two controls with
concentrations ranging from 0.0251 ng/mL to 17.1026 ng/mL were tested in
singlicate on one Elecsys 2010 for 10 days. The concentration with an inter-
assay ≤ 10% CV was 0.3 ng/mL. The sponsor is using the LoQ, 0.3 ng/mL,
as the lowest limit of the measuring range.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity and endogenous interference studies:
Analytical specificity was evaluated on the Elecsys 2010 with the Elecsys
Troponin I STAT reagent for possible cross reactants of skeletal muscle TnI,
recombinant cardiac troponin T (TnT), purified troponin C (TnC) and skeletal
muscle TnT, as well as endogenous interferents of hemolysis, biotin, lipemia,
bilirubin and rheumatoid factors.
Two samples of different Troponin I concentrations were analyzed in
duplicate for each cross reactant and interferent. One sample had Troponin I
values within the clinical decision range of 0.3-0.5 ng/mL. The second
sample had Troponin I values ranging from approximately 2.5-2.8 ng/mL.

--- Page 15 ---
Samples were split and spiked with the appropriate compounds at various
concentrations and compared to an unaltered aliquot of the sample.
Concentrations up to 2000 ng/mL of skeletal TnI, recombinant cardiac TnT,
purified troponin C (TnC), and skeletal muscle TnT did not cross-react with
the assay.
Hemoglobin up to 0.4 g/dL, biotin up to 30 ng/mL, lipemia (Intralipid) up to
1,500 mg/dL, bilirubin up to 25 mg/dL and rheumatoid factors up to 1,500
IU/mL did not interfere with the assay. Labeling states that grossly
hemolyzed samples should not be used.
52 potentially interfering common compounds and prescription drugs were
tested in 100 times higher than expected dose level in plasma. A list of these
compounds can be found in the package insert.
f. Assay cut-off:
The sponsor determined the AMI cut-off to be 0.3 ng/mL. See clinical
sensitivity 3a below.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison was conducted between the predicate and the Elecsys
2010 using the Troponin I STAT reagent. 114 samples with troponin I values
covering the measuring range were analyzed in singlicate. Regression was
calculated using Passing-Bablock, Standardized Linearity and Deming
equations. The results are summarized below.

Based on the method comparison, clinical data was used to determine
substantial equivalency. See section M.3.a. To demonstrate equivalence
between the two reagent systems, comparisons were performed between the
Troponin I immunoassay reagent on the MODULAR Analytics E170 and the
Troponin I STAT immunoassay reagent on the Elecsys 2010. 115 samples
were analyzed on the E170 and the Elecsys 2010. All samples were run in

b. Matrix comparison:
In order to demonstrate equivalence of TnI results among serum, lithium
heparin, K2-EDTA and K3-EDTA plasmas, sample pairs were evaluated
across the measuring range (0.33-24.83 ng/mL). Both native and spiked
samples were included in the studies. Results of the plasmas versus serum

b. Clinical specificity:
See 3.a. clinical sensitivity above.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
4. Clinical cut-off:
A separate cutoff study was performed prior to the clinical studies performed in
M.3.a above. 652 subjects from one US site and one non-US site were evaluated
for chest pain. Using the clinician’s diagnosis, based on the ESC/AHA/ACC
criteria, 358 subjects (102 females, 256 males) were included in the determination
of the AMI cut-off study. Multiple blood samples were drawn and analyzed using
the Troponin I assay and plotted using ROC analysis. A summary is below
showing the standard deviation, and lower and upper confidence limits.
The cut-off was determined to be 0.3 ng/mL with a CV ≤ 10%.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
In a study of 1,137 apparently healthy individuals from 4 US sites and 2 European
sites, the troponin I levels were determined to be < 0.3 ng/mL
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
