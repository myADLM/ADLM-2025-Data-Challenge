K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The EliA wells are coated with a specific antigen. If antibodies that recognize that
specific antigen are present in the patient’s specimen they will bind. After washing
away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgG antibodies
EliA IgG conjugate is added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After
incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away and the bound complex is incubated
with a development solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the
reaction mixture is measured. The higher the response value, the more specific IgG is
present in the specimen. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is
compared directly to the response for calibrators. The EliA IgG calibration is a total
IgG calibration. It is based on a set of six WHO-standardized IgG calibrators derived
from human serum. The calibrators are required to perform an initial calibration
curve, which can be stored in the ImmunoCAP instrument and may be used up to 28
days. Each assay outside of a calibration run includes curve controls that have to fall
within defined ranges to verify that the stored calibration curve is still valid.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Imprecision of the assays on the ImmunoCap 100 instrument was assessed by
testing five samples (seven for La) in duplicate over 18 runs (3 instruments x
6 runs each, n = 36 per sample). Imprecision of the assays on the ImmunoCap
250 instrument was assessed by testing five samples (seven for La) in
duplicate over 21 runs (3 instruments x 7 runs each).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The recovery of each assay was tested by further diluting at least one sample near
the positive value and at least one sample near the upper limit of the measuring
range from the method-specific 1:100 dilution. The samples were tested in
triplicate and recovery was determined by comparing the observed concentration
to the expected concentration.
The measuring range is claimed from the detection limit to upper limit. The
sponsor notes in the labeling that the upper limit of the reported results can vary
due to a lot-specific conversion from μg/L to EliA U/mL. Results above the stated
upper limit are reported as “above”. They also state that due to differing binding
characteristics of the antibodies in patient samples, not all sera can be diluted
linearly within the measuring range.
Assay specific findings are described below:
EliA™ CENP Immunoassay:
Acceptable recovery was observed in four high samples (range 215.7 – 109.0
EliA U/mL) and in a low positive sample (13.0 EliA U/mL). The claimed
measuring range of the EliA™ CENP Immunoassay is 0.4 – 240 EliA U/mL.
Negative samples are <7 EliA U/mL, equivocal samples are 7 -10 EliA U/mL,
and positive samples are >10 EliA U/mL.
EliA™ U1RNP Immunoassay:
Acceptable recovery was observed in three of four high samples (initial values
240 – 152.2 EliA U/mL). Acceptable recovery of a low positive sample (11.4
EliA U/mL) was found for the 1:2 and 1:3 dilution; the 1:5 dilution (expected
value 2.3 EliA U/mL, observed value 1.8 EliA U/mL ) and the 1:10 dilution
(expected value 1.1 EliA U/mL, observed value 0.8 EliA U/mL ) did not meet
the acceptance criteria. These values are well below the equivocal range.
The claimed measuring range of the EliA™ U1RNP Immunoassay is 0.3 –
240 EliA U/mL. Negative samples are <5 EliA U/mL, equivocal samples are 5
- 10 EliA U/mL, and positive samples are >10 EliA U/mL.
EliA™ Sm Immunoassay:
Acceptable recovery was observed in two of four high samples (range 96.1 –
75.3 EliA U/mL). Samples that did not dilute linearly showed high recovery.
Recovery of a sample in the equivocal zone (7.8 EliA U/mL) met acceptance
criteria. The claimed measuring range of the EliA™ Sm Immunoassay is 0.1 –
120 EliA U/mL. Negative samples are <5 EliA U/mL, equivocal samples are 5
- 10 EliA U/mL, and positive samples are >10 EliA U/mL.
EliA™ Ro Immunoassay:
Acceptable recovery was observed in two of four high samples (range 281.8 –
6

--- Page 7 ---
109.3 EliA U/mL). Samples that did not dilute linearly showed high recovery.
Recovery of a low positive sample (10.4 EliA U/mL) met acceptance criteria.
The claimed measuring range of the EliA™ Ro Immunoassay is 0.3 – 240
EliA U/mL. Negative samples are <7 EliA U/mL, equivocal samples are 7 -
10 EliA U/mL, and positive samples are >10 EliA U/mL.
EliA™ La Immunoassay:
Acceptable recovery was observed in four high samples (range 307.4 – 279.7
EliA U/mL) and in a low positive sample (24.4 EliA U/mL). The claimed
measuring range of the EliA™ La Immunoassay is 0.3 – 320 EliA U/mL.
Negative samples are <3 EliA U/mL, equivocal samples are 3 - 8 EliA U/mL,
and positive samples are >8 EliA U/mL.
Hook Effect:
The sponsor cites Peng and Craft 1 that no hook effects could be observed for
concentrations up to 10 fold above the measuring ranges for these antigens.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
EliA IgG Calibrators and Curve Controls are derived from a purchased
immunoglobulin preparation (GAMMANORM, Biovitrum AB, Stockholm,
Sweden). The IgG calibrators are traceable (via an unbroken chain of
calibrations) to the International Reference Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of Human
Serum Immunoglobulins A, G and M from WHO. New batches of IgG
Calibrators are compared to a secondary standard (standardized with the IRP)
or the IRP directly and adjusted accordingly to meet the correct concentration.
The instrument measures specific IgG concentrations in μg/L. By using a
conversion factor given by the lot-specific code of the EliA ANA Wells, the
results are automatically converted to EliA U/mL.
Assay Stability:
An accelerated shelf life study the shelf life showed that each assay is stable for
24 months. The results were confirmed with a real time stability study. A study
supported the claim that the assays were stable for 9 months after initial
opening.
Sample Stability:
The sponsor cites CLSI document H18-A3 in recommending the following
storage conditions for samples:
(cid:131) Separated serum/plasma should remain at room temperature for no longer
than eight hours.
(cid:131) If assays will not be completed within eight hours, serum/plasma should
be refrigerated (2 to 8°C).
(cid:131) If assays are not completed within 48 hours, or the separated

--- Page 8 ---
serum/plasma will be stored beyond 48 hours, serum/plasma should be
frozen at or below -20°C.
d. Detection limit:
The lower limit of the measuring range of each assay was determined by
measuring dilutions (1:2, 1:4, and 1:8) of Calibrator 4.0 (4.0 μg/L) in the
Calibrator Wells. The results in Response Units (RU) were compared with the
result of the sample diluent on EliA dsDNA Wells. The discrimination ability
(D) of the assay is the ability of the assay to discriminate a reading from
background at a given concentration; the value should be >2.0.
EliA™ CENP Well, EliA™ U1RNP Well, EliA™ Ro Well,:
These new devices were able to discriminate samples containing 0.5 μg/L IgG
(Cal 4.0 1:8) from the background. The corresponding detection limit was
0.25 EliA U/mL when using 0.5 as correction factor to convert μg/L to EliA
U/mL.
EliA™ Sm Well:
The new device was able to discriminate samples containing 0.5 μg/L IgG
(Cal 4.0 1:8) from the background. The corresponding detection limit was
0.125 EliA U/mL when using 0.25 as correction factor to convert μg/L to EliA
U/mL.
EliA™ La Well:
The new device was able to discriminate samples containing 0.5 μg/L IgG
(Cal 4.0 1:8) from the background. The corresponding detection limit was
0.33 EliA U/mL when using 0.66 as correction factor to convert μg/L to EliA
U/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The specificity of the assays was evaluated by testing samples from the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ANA serum panel and the
Association of Medical Laboratory Immunologists (AMLI) consensus panel
(2001). See below for the known specificity of each sample:

There was no demonstrated interference with any of the assays at these
concentrations except for hemoglobin in EliA La. The sponsor demonstrated
that hemoglobin did not interfere with the EliA La assay up to a concentration
of 25,950 mg/dL in undiluted serum.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Samples known to be positive or negative for respective ANA antibodies were
analyzed together with a calibrator curve run in duplicates. Calibrators and
Controls of the predicate device were also analyzed in duplicates. Test results
were evaluated according to the description in the corresponding Directions for
Use. For the calculation of Positive Percent Agreement, Negative Percent
Agreement and Overall Agreement, equivocal results were excluded.

b. Matrix comparison:
The suitability of different sample matrices for each assay was determined by
collecting serum, EDTA, heparin and citrate plasma samples from fifty
different donors. Sample values spanned the range of the assays. Negative
samples did not switch to positive in any serum/plasma combination in any
assay. Linear regression of the equivocal and positive samples for each
serum/plasma combination in each assay demonstrated that the matrices were
equivalent.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor tested 400 apparently healthy Blood Donor samples from Caucasian
individuals equally distributed by sex and age to evaluate expected values in the
normal population and to confirm the previously defined cut-offs. The sponsor’s
acceptance criteria for validating the cut-offs was that the 95th percentile should
lie below the lower limit of the equivocal range and the 99th percentile should lie
below the upper limit of the equivocal range.
