Uritest 50 and Uritest 500B urine analyzers
I. Device Description:
The Uritest-50 and Uritest-500B Urine Chemistry Analyzers are reflectance
spectrophotometers that measure the reflectance from a Uritest 10G or Uritest 11G urine
reagent strip for urinalysis. Both devices can display and print urinalysis results and can be
connected to a laboratory computer for data management. Both analyzers are capable of
reading the ascorbic acid pad on the Uritest 11G strip.
Uritest 10G strips and the Uritest 11G are dry chemistry reagent strips for use in urine. Both
strips measure urine glucose, pH, urobilinogen, bilirubin, protein, specific gravity, ketone,
blood, leukocyte esterase and nitrite. The Uritest 11G can also measure ascorbic acid.

L. Test Principle:
Uritest 50 and Uritest 500B
The Uritest 50 and Uritest 500B utilize reflectance photometry to measure the concentration
of various urine chemical compounds and constituents. A urine wetted reagent strip is placed
into the instrument(s) causing a color change in the test pads. The degree of color
development on the pads is proportional to the concentration of the urine analyte. The strip
passes under a LED light source. As the pad darkens in color, more light is absorbed and less
is reflected. The reflected light is filtered at specific wavelengths corresponding to the
reflected colors on the test pads. It is converted by the optical-electronic sensor system into
electrical signals which are then converted into concentration units and printed.
Uritest 10G and Uritest 11G Test Strips
Leukocytes: The test reveals the presence of granulocyte esterases. These esterases cleave an
indoxyl ester, and the indoxyl so liberated reacts with a diazonium salt to produce a violet
dye. Leukocyte esterase results may be positive in the absence of observable cells if the
leukocytes have lysed. Positive results may occasionally be found with random specimens
from females due to contamination of the specimen by vaginal discharge. Elevated glucose
concentrations (1000-2000mg/dL) or high specific gravity may cause decreased test results.
The presence of cephalexin, cephalothin, tetracycline may cause decreased reactivity, and
high levels of the drug may cause a false negative reaction. Reactivity may also vary with
temperature. The test area does not react with lymphocyte.
Ketone: This test is based on the principle of Legal’s test and is more sensitive to acetoacetic
acid than to acetone. The reagent area does not react with β-hydroxybutyric acid. Some high
specific gravity/low pH urines may give reactions up to and including Trace. Normal urine
specimens usually yield negative results with this reagent. False positive results (Trace) may
occur with highly pigmented urine specimens or those containing large amounts or levodopa
metabolites.
Nitrite: The test is based on the principle of Griess’s test and is specific to nitrite. Any
degree of uniform pink colour development should be interpreted as a positive.
Nitrite test area reacts singularly to the nitrite. Reacting color density does not correlate to
number of existing bacteria. A negative result does not in itself prove that there is no
significant bacteria. Negative results may occur when urinary tract infections are cause by
organisms which do not contain reductase to convert nitrate to nitrite; when urine has not
been retained in the bladder long enough (4-8hrs) for reduction of nitrate to occur; or when
dietary nitrate is absent, even if organisms containing reductase are present and bladder
incubation is ample. Ascorbic acid concentrations of 25mg/dL or greater may cause false
negative results with specimens containing nitrite ion concentrations of 0.4mg/dL or less.
Urobilinogen: This test is based on the Ehrlich reaction.
The reagent area may react with interfering substances known to react with Ehrlich’s reagent.
Excreted pigments and medicaments that have a red intrinsic coloration in acidic medium
may produce false positive results. This test is inhibited by elevated concentrations of
formaldehyde. Strip reactivity increases with temperature increasing； the optimum
temperature is 22°C to 26°C. The absence of urobilinogen cannot be determined with this
7

--- Page 8 ---
test.
Bilirubin: This test is based on the coupling of bilirubin with diazonium salt in an acid
medium. Normally no bilirubin is detectable in urine by even the most sensitive methods.
Even trace amounts of bilirubin are sufficiently abnormal to require further investigation.
Some urine constituents (medicines, urinary indicants) may produce a yellowish or reddish
discoloration of the test paper that may interfere with interpreting the result. Ascorbic acid
concentrations of 100mg/dL or greater may cause false negatives.
Protein: The test is based on the principle of the protein error of a pH indicator.
The reagent area is more sensitive to albumin. An elevated pH (up to 9) may affect the test.
The residues of disinfectants containing quaternary ammonium groups or chlorohexidine are
present in the urine vessel maybe lead to a false positive result.
Glucose: The test is based on the specific glucose oxidase/peroxidase reaction.
The test is specific for glucose, no substance excreted in urine other than glucose is known to
give a positive result. Ascorbic acid of more than 45mg/dL and/or high Ketone
concentrations (80mg/dL) may cause false negatives for specimens containing small amounts
of glucose (100mg/dL). The reactivity of the glucose test decreases as the SG of the urine
increases. False positive reactions may be caused by hypochlorite or peroxide (cleaning
agents). Reactivity may also vary with temperature.
Specific Gravity: This test contains a detergent and Bromthymol blue that indicates the
presence of ionic constituents in the urine by changing color from green to yellow.
The specific gravity test permits determination of urine specific gravity between 1.005 and
1.030. In general, it correlates within 0.005 with values obtained with the refractive index
method. Strips are automatically adjusted for pH by the instrument when pH≥7.0 or pH≤5.0.
Highly buffered alkaline urine may cause low readings relative to other methods. Elevated
specific gravity readings may be obtained in the presence of moderate quantities (500mg/dL)
of protein.
Blood: Hemoglobin and myoglobin catalyze the oxidation of the indicator by means of
organic hydroperoxide contained in the test paper.
This test is highly sensitive to hemoglobin and thus complements microscopic examination.
The sensitivity of this test may be reduced in urine with high specific gravity. The test is
equally sensitive to myoglobin as to hemoglobin. Captopril and Lodine may also cause
decreased reactivity. Blood is often found in the urine of menstruating females. Certain
oxidizing contaminants, such as hypochlorite, may produce false positive results. Microbial
peroxidase associated with urinary tract infection may cause a false positive reaction.
Ascorbic acid concentrations greater than 25mg/dL may cause false negatives at the trace
levels.
pH : This test contains a mixed indicator which assures a marked change in colour between
pH4.5 and pH9.
Ascorbic Acid (Uritest 11G only): The test involves the decolorization of Tillman’s
reagent. False positive results may occur.

Repeatability (within run) precision of both analyzers was evaluated by using
negative urines and spiked urines of known concentrations for each analyte. Each
sample was tested 20 times across 3 instruments with the Uritest 10G or Uritest 11G
strips for a total of 60 measurements at each concentration. All concentrations for all
tests had 60 of 60 (100%) match at ± one color block.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor recommends using commercially available control materials for use on
the Uritest 50 and Uritest-500B urine analyzers.
Calibration verification is performed using Check Strips which are included with the
analyzers. These are white strips which check the remittance values for each test.
Recommendations for calibration verification are included in the operator’s manual
for each analyzer.
Real time stability studies were performed for the Uritest 10G and Uritest 11G test
strips over a 21 month period. The test strips were stored at 2° C-8° C and 30° C.
Strips were tested quarterly with negative and spiked positive urine samples on the
Uritest 50 and Uritest 500 Urine Analyzers. Data demonstrated that the test strips
met the sponsor’s claimed shelf-life of 18 months at 2°C-30°C and <= 80% Relative
Humidity.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical sensitivities of the Uritest 10G and Uritest 11G strips on the Uritest 50 and
Uritest-500B were evaluated by spiking urine with known concentrations of each
analyte and then diluting these samples with a negative urine to establish the range
where the strip went from negative readings to positive readings. Each concentration
was tested 10 times on each analyzer using each strip type. The upper limit of
sensitivity was defined as the cutoff at which 100% of the test results were trace or
positive. The sensitivities for both analyzers and both strips were identical. pH and
specific gravity do not have lower limits of sensitivity. See section M.1.b.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The clinical study was performed at three different clinical sites over 10 days. Three
intended users operated the devices at each site (n=9). 321 out-patients were enrolled
in the study: 104 subjects at Site 1, 102 subjects at Site 2 and 115 subjects at Site 3.
The users used the labeling to perform the testing.
The sponsor also used 19 spiked urine samples in the study (N=340). 5 spiked
samples at the Site 1, 9 spiked samples at the Site 2 and 5 spiked samples at Site 3.
Among these samples, about 25%~35% positive samples were covered for each
analyte with majority of values at the cutoff. Both subject urine samples and spiked
urine samples at each clinical site were tested both on Uritest 10G, Uritest 11G and
Bayer Multistix 10SG using the respective urine analyzer for each system.
The comparisons were as follows with the following note below:
Glucose has different test pad concentrations between the candidate devices and the
predicate devices. The differences are summarized below:

In addition, the sponsor performed ascorbic acid comparisons between the Uritest 50
and the Uritest 500B against the Dirui H-500 Urine Analyzer (k040703) on 216
samples at three sites using three intended users per site. The site combined results

N. Instrument Name:
Uritest-50 and Uritest 500B
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Uritest 50 and Uritest-500B are automated urine analyzers using reflectance
25

--- Page 26 ---
spectroscopy for the semi-quantitative determination of pH, Specific Gravity, Protein,
Glucose, Ketones, Urobilinogen, Bilirubin, Leukocyte esterase, Blood, Nitrite and
Ascorbic Acid in urine samples. English is the default language.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes __X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Numerical specimen identification information can be entered manually via a keypad on
the analyzers, or it is available for use with a bar code scanner using the PS/2 port on the
back of the instruments.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Uritest-50 analyzes one strip at a time. The user must wait for the completion of the strip
before loading the next one.
Uritest 500B can analyze multiple strips. The user wets the test strip and places it on a
sample tray. The analyzer pulls the strip inside to begin timing and analysis. The
instrument prompts the user to wet another strip and put it on the tray thereby allowing
multiple strips to be processed for analysis at one time.
5. Calibration:
Calibration is factory set, however a white calibration strip is used to check the
remittance outputs of the LEDs in the read head. Labeling recommends that the user
perform the calibration verification with the white strip after maintenance, with a new lot
of strips, with a new bottle of strips, change of operator, or when there is a question with
results.
6. Quality Control:
QC is analyzed like the patient samples. The QC data is not stored separately from
patient data, however both analyzers can be connected to a computer via a RS 232 port.
Labeling recommends two levels of quality control need to be assayed according to state,
federal and local guidelines and 1) after using the check strip, 2) after maintenance or
service 3) when starting a new lot number of test strips, 4) when starting a new bottle of
test strips 5) changing operator, 6) when there are questionable results, 7) every 30 days
to check the storage conditions of the strips.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:

Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
