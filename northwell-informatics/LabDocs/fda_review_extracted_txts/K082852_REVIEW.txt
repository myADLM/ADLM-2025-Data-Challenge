--- Page 2 ---
4. Panel:
Microbiology
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is intended for the in vitro
rapid identification (ID) of gram positive bacteria from pure culture belonging to
the genera Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, other gram positive cocci and gram
positive bacilli. The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is also
intended for the quantitative determination of antimicrobial susceptibility by
minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of most gram positive bacterial isolates
from pure culture belonging to the genera Staphylococcus and Enterococcus.
2. Indication(s) for use:
This premarket notification is indicated for the addition of the antimicrobial agent
nitrofurantoin at concentrations of 4 – 128μg/mL to Gram-positive ID/AST or
AST only Phoenix panels for testing S. aureus, Enterococci (e.g. E. faecalis) with
activity against Coagulase-negative staphylococci (including S. epidermidis and S.
saprophyticus).
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use
Results of E. faecium with nitrofurantoin have been excluded in the BD
Phoenix™ therefore no results will be reported. An alternate method should be
performed when this combination is identified.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable
I. Device Description:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST
indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and
equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD CrystalSpec™
Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST broth, which contains an AST
indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST broth is a cation-adjusted formulation
2

--- Page 3 ---
of Mueller-Hinton broth containing 0.01% Tween 80. After adding the indicator solution
to the AST inoculum the color turns to blue. After inoculation and incubation, the color
changes to pink then to colorless as reduction in the panel well proceeds. Inoculated
panels are barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology
System instrument where the panels are continuously incubated at 35°C. The AST has a
final inoculum of 5 x 105 CFU/ml. The instrument incubates, reads and records the
results of the biochemical substrates and antimicrobial agents and interprets the reactions
to give an ID of the isolate and MIC value and category interpretation of the
antimicrobial agents. Organisms growing in the presence of a given antimicrobic agent
reduce the indicator, signaling organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobic agent.
Organisms killed or inhibited by a given antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the
indicator and therefore do not produce a color change. Additional interpretation is done
using a software driven “EXPERT” System using rules derived from the CLSI
documentation.
Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an AST result available between 4-16
hours. This is only an autoread result; no manual readings are possible with this system.

“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S18) “Methods for Dilution
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved
Standard.”
L. Test Principle:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth based microdilution
method that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance
detection of organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells
containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control
wells” which contains no antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Ten gram positive isolates were evaluated for site to site and inter site
reproducibility demonstrating >95% reproducibility. The ten isolate study
described in the guidance document was used (10 organisms tested 3 times on
3 days at 3 sites).

aureus ATCC 25922 and E. faecalis ATCC 29212 were tested on every test
occasion with the reference method and the BD Phoenix™. There appears to
be no difference between the modes of the BD Phoenix™ and the reference
method. The reference method QC results were in range for every day tested.
The BD Phoenix™ was tested a sufficient number of times to demonstrate
that the system can produce QC results in the recommended ranges.
