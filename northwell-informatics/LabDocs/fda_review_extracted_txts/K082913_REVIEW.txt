H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Doxycycline at a concentration of 0.25-16 µg/mL on the Phoenix ™ Gram
Positive ID/AST or AST only Phoenix panels is intended for use with the BD
Phoenix Automated Microbiology System for in vitro quantitative determination
of antimicrobial susceptibility by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of most
Gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria isolates from pure
culture for Enterobacteriaceae and non – Enterobacteriaceae and most Gram-
positive bacteria isolates from pure culture belonging to the genera
Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus.
2. Indication(s) for use:
This premarket notification is indicated for the addition of the antimicrobial agent
doxycycline at concentrations of 0.25-16 µg/mL to the Phoenix ™ Gram Positive
ID/AST or AST only for testing S. aureus (Doxycycline is not the drug of choice
in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infections) and Enterococcus group
(Streptococcus faecalis or Streptococcus faecium).
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST
indicator. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily
identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth,
and equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the recommendation to use the BD
CrystalSpec™ Nephelometer. A further dilution is made into an AST broth, which
contains an AST indicator, prior to inoculating the panel. The AST broth is a cation-
adjusted formulation of Mueller-Hinton broth containing 0.01% Tween 80. After

--- Page 3 ---
adding the indicator solution to the AST inoculum the color turns to blue. After
inoculation and incubation, the color changes to pink then to colorless as reduction in
the panel well proceeds. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded into the
BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System instrument where the panels are
continuously incubated at 35°C. The AST has a final inoculum of 5 x 105 CFU/ml.
The instrument incubates, reads and records the results of the biochemical substrates
and antimicrobial agents and interprets the reactions to give an ID of the isolate and
MIC value and category interpretation of the antimicrobial agents. Organisms
growing in the presence of a given antimicrobic agent reduce the indicator, signaling
organism growth and resistance to the antimicrobic agent. Organisms killed or
inhibited by a given antimicrobic do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore
do not produce a color change. Additional interpretation is done using a software
driven “EXPERT” System using rules derived from the CLSI documentation.
Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an AST result available between 4-16
hours. This is only an autoread result; no manual readings are possible with this
system.

Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S18) “Methods for
Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard.”
L. Test Principle:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth based microdilution
method that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance
detection of organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells
containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control
wells” which contains no antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Twelve on-scale isolates were evaluated for site to site and inter site
reproducibility demonstrating >95% reproducibility. The ten isolate study
described in the guidance document was used (10 organisms tested 3 times on

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The FDA and CLSI recommended Quality Control (QC) isolates, E. faecalis
ATCC 29212 and S. aureus ATCC 29213 were tested on every test occasion
with the reference method and the BD Phoenix™. BD Phoenix produced
acceptable QC results as compared to the reference method results >95% of
the time. The reference method QC results were in range for every day tested.
The BD Phoenix™ was tested a sufficient number of times to demonstrate
that the system can produce QC results in the recommended ranges.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The broth dilution reference panel was prepared according to CLSI
recommendation and was used to compare with the BD Phoenix™ results.
Clinical testing was performed at three sites. The testing included both fresh
clinical isolates and stock isolates along with a challenge set with known
results. The test device had a growth rate of >90%. A comparison was
provided to the reference method with the following agreement.

EA-Essential Agreement maj-major discrepancies
CA-Category Agreement vmj-very major discrepancies
R-resistant isolates min- minor discrepancies
Essential agreement (EA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panels agree with the
reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference
method. Category agreement (CA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panel result
interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation.
Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the BD Phoenix™ and
the reference and have on-scale EA.
There were 38 min errors with E. faecalis with a min error rate of 19.6% (38/194).
Of these min errors, 37 were in essential agreement. If the min errors that are in
essential agreement were removed, then the min error rate would be 0.5% which is
acceptable.
There were 11 min errors with E. faecium with a min error rate of 9.9% which is
still acceptable. All 11 min errors were in essential agreement.
